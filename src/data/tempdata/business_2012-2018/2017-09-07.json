The airline is proposing an overhaul that would limit retirement payouts from its defined benefit scheme (Naps).

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s a good moment to stop. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW It\u2019s always interesting to see which press conference clips the ECB choose to plug over twitter.... How longer might the eurozone experience record low interest rates, currently set at zero percent? Lena Komileva of G+ Economics reckons they could last for at least another year, and possible rather longer. She writes: The ECB kept its forward guidance on interest rates and asset purchases, namely that interest rates are expected to remain at their \u201cpresent levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases\u201d and that \u201cwe stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration\u201d. With no changes to the ECB\u2019s policy sequencing (QE vs rates) under discussion, the guidance now means that rates will not be raised until after the end of asset purchases, which is likely to be late 2018 or early 2019 at the earliest. European stock markets have ended the day higher. The FTSE 100 gained 0.6%, or 42 points, at 7,398. Germany\u2019s DAX gained 0.67%, while France\u2019s CAC rose by 0.25%. The euro is bobbing around the $1.20 mark too, up almost one euro cent today, following the news that the ECB has started discussing how to tackle its stimulus programme. Joshua Mahony of IG says: Draghi managed to keep the euro gains relatively contained today, with the talk of extremely accommodative policy dampening early gains for the single currency. With Draghi due to set out his stall for how the ECB will embark of its QE tapering in October, the big question is whether tapering will begin in 2017 or 2018. Marilyn Watson, head of global fundamental fixed income strategy at BlackRock, predicts that the ECB will end its QE programme by next December. Given the currency bloc\u2019s improving fundamental backdrop and recent impressive data releases, particularly in Germany, not to mention the shortage of supply of bonds to buy, we believe that the ECB will fully taper its asset purchase programme by the end of 2018. Adrian Hilton, head of global rates and currency at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, says Mario Draghi was more relaxed than some investors expected today: At its present level, at least, he doesn\u2019t seem to think the euro threatens the medium term inflation objective.\u201d \u201cAs it is, we think this leaves the ECB on track to taper its asset purchases from the start of next year, although we may have to wait until the October meeting \u2013 or maybe longer \u2013 to see the details. Were the euro to push on towards the 1.25 level versus the dollar, however, the bank may find itself trapped between a disinflationary exchange rate and a need to phase out its QE purchases before it runs out of bonds to buy.\u201d Mario Draghi\u2019s comments about the euro are significant, says Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe. \u201cDraghi acknowledged that the euro\u2019s explosive strength this year is a source of uncertainty and worth monitoring.\u201d The key message from Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference is that the ECB is getting ready to slow its stimulus programme, but it\u2019s not in a rush. President Draghi tried to be as vague as possible, while sticking to his pledge to decide the future of its bond-buying programme this autumn. He confirmed that the governing council had begun \u2018very preliminary\u2019 talks about how the quantitative easing programme might be changed; how much longer it might run, and how much it might pump into the euro economy. This was the key statement from the ECB chief: \u201cWe will announce when we are ready. We think we are going to be ready for much of what we have to decide in October ... if we are not then we postpone.\u201d Traders have taken this as a sign that QE will be toned down from its current \u20ac60bn per month pace from January. Crucially, Draghi didn\u2019t seem too alarmed by the strength of the euro - claiming at one stage that he didn\u2019t even know where the single currency was trading today (it peaked at $1.2059 during his press conference). He also stated several times that interest rates will remain at their present record lows for a long time - that\u2019s meant to reassure households and businesses. Meanwhile in Athens, French president Emmanuel Macron has begun talks with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras. In his first hour of official contact with Greece\u2019s head of state, the French leader praised Athens\u2019 austerity reforms and repeated calls for the indebted country to finally be given debt relief. Meanwhile, anti-austerity groups, including breakaway militants from Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party, have announced they will defy a ban on demonstrations and take to the streets in protest against the mass sell-off of state assets around which much of the visit will focus. The far leftists, many members of the Popular Unity party, have called the ban - part of draconian security measures in the capital - an insult against \u201cthe democratic freedoms of the Greek people and first of all the right of peaceful protest.\u201d \u201cPopular Unity will not be disciplined by government and police arbitrariness ... Greece is not for sale. Workers are not, and will not, become slaves.\u201d The demonstration will take place around 6pm local time - ahead of Macron outlining his vision for Europe in a speech from the ancient Pnyx. Neil Wilson of ETX Capital has helpfully fired over this neat list of the key points from the ECB\u2019s press conference: \u2018Bulk\u2019 of QE decisions to be taken at October meeting EZ growth stable and broad based - GDP outlook revised up to 2.2% in 2017, best growth since 2007 Medium-term inflation projections revised lower chiefly due to euro appreciation Measures of underlying inflation have ticked up but remain at very subdued levels Broad \u2018dissatisfaction\u2019 with inflation, but this is tempered by confidence that inflation will eventually converge with target Most members reiterated worries about exchange rate pressures first raised by some policymakers at the last meeting Appreciation of euro has \u2018unquestionably\u2019 led to tightening of financial conditions ECB monitoring euro exchange rate, but doesn\u2019t seem overly concerned about overshoot at present. (Could change if EURUSD hits $1.25?) Interest rates will remain at present levels well past end of QE finishes; ECB still stands ready to increase the QE programme in terms of size and/or duration No discussions on scarcity of bonds (seems unlikely), Draghi says ECB has repeatedly shown it can cope with scarcity issue Draghi keen to stress that patience is needed, wont \u2018experiment\u2019 with interest rate forecasts Draghi reiterated need for structural reforms to be substantially stepped up ECB not resigned to permanently low inflation, expects convergence with target sooner or later EURUSD rises above 1.20 handle to retest August\u2019s 2 \u00bd year highs Wilson adds: \u201cMission largely accomplished: Mario Draghi successfully guided the market to expect a tapering announcement in October without sounding hawkish. And finally, a question from a journalist from German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. Q: Do you have any information about the negative side effects of the quantitative easing programme that you can share with us? \u201cThe negative side effects of the quantitative easing programme\u201d repeats Draghi slowly, perhaps aghast at the very suggestion that his precious scheme might not be an unmitigated triumph. We simply don\u2019t see any side-effects, he insists, and any potential side-effects are vastly overwhelmed by the positive effects of the bond-buying scheme. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Q: What decisions do you think will be taken about your QE stimulus scheme in October? We discussed a set of different scenarios today, Draghi replies. They centred on the different lengths and sizes that the bond-buying programme could run at, and the \u2018trade offs\u2019 between those two factors. In other words, the ECB is starting to talk about how much money it might want to pump into the economy from January 2017, and for how much longer it might be needed. Q: Your inflation forecasts only run up until 2019, but what do you think will happen in 2020? I expect we will meet all our targets in 2020, smiles Draghi - without mentioning that his term will have expired by then. Asked about Emmanuel Macron\u2019s economic plans, Draghi says France\u2019s labor market reforms should aim at the \u201celimination of dualism\u201d. That\u2019s the issue where new hires have weaker labour rights than long-serving workers, so they are laid off when a recession hits. Q: Why is monetary policy so loose, when the economy is on track to grow much faster than in recent years? Mario Draghi points to the \u201cbig labour market slack\u201d to justify today\u2019s record low interest rates. He adds that the ECB doesn\u2019t have a \u201cdual mandate\u201d like the Federal Reserve, so it can\u2019t consider issues like unemployment. It just has to focus on price stability. Q: What does Mr Draghi think of Estonia\u2019s plans to launch its own state-backed cryptocurrency? No eurozone country can launch its own currency, Draghi insists. Q: Should we just accept that eurozone inflation won\u2019t get back to the ECB\u2019s target? Not at all, Draghi replies. We just need \u2018confidence, patience and persistence\u2019 while the recovery in the economy feeds through to prices. Now a question about the future of the eurozone. Q: What powers should any future eurozone finance ministry have? Member states have realised how incomplete our monetary union is, and how it made the eurozone crisis worse than it would have been We should welcome that they\u2019ve started this \u2018complex\u2019 discussion, says Draghi. We\u2019re ready to help, but we\u2019re not part of it. Q: Are you concerned that the euro is trading above the levels at which your forecasts were drawn up ($1.18)? I don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s trading, Draghi replies, before peeking at a note from his communications director, Christine Graeff.... ... I\u2019m told its $1.20, well OK, but I don\u2019t comment on exchange rate levels anyway. A journalist tries to lure the ECB president into commenting about the euro\u2019s strength, by asking \u2018professor Draghi\u2019 to comment on when a strong currency becomes a problem. I don\u2019t comment on the exchange rate, Draghi replies firmly. I left university a long time ago, longer than I care to remember. Draghi now denies that the eurozone is in a period of high uncertainty while the ECB plots its next move. We\u2019re simply discussing what to do next year, when our present programme expires, he adds. Q: What steps must the ECB take to ensure that banks who move from the City to the eurozone after Brexit are supervised properly, as such big banks bring big risks? Draghi volleys this question to his deputy, V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio. It\u2019s very simple - we are prepared, Const\u00e2ncio replies. The ECB already regulators large investment banks, so \u201cno specific difficulties will come from this\u201d. Q: Are you worried about bubbles in the financial markets? (an issue raised by Deutsche Bank\u2019s John Cryan yesterday) No, says Draghi. He does single out the \u2018prime commercial real estate\u2019 market, saying valuations look stretched. But even here, there aren\u2019t signs that leverage is increasing (higher leverage is a big warning sign that a bubble is forming, as shown in the 1929 crash). Q: Do you take national government issues into account when deciding how and when to taper QE? We act according to our mandate, Mario Draghi replies. Q: So the German elections aren\u2019t a factor? No. The euro has soared over $1.20, gaining more than 1.2 cents to $1.2040. Speaking of batting balls away.... The bulk of our decisions about our asset purchase programme will be taken in October, Draghi says, in response to another question about QE. Q: So will we get a full roadmap in October, saying how you might reduce the pace of the programme. Have you a personal preference? I don\u2019t, smiles Draghi, batting this ball safely away. Q: And have you discussed the issue of bond scarcity? No, says Draghi, We\u2019ve shown we can cope with this issue successfully. Onto questions. Q: Did you have any discussions about the future of QE today? And is the euro a problem at its current level? Mario Draghi embarks on a long answer, which threatens to take up the entire press conference. All members of the governing council spoke about three issues today, Draghi replies, growth, inflation and the exchange rate. On growth, there was agreement that the economy was strengthening with six million new jobs created since the crisis. But there must be patience.... On inflation, there was a small downward revision \u2018due to the exchange rate appreciation\u2019. Draghi says there is \u201cbroad dissatisfaction\u2019 with the inflation rate today. On the exchange rate, although exports are doing well today the euro FX rate will \u201chave consequences\u201d. So there were concerns expressed by a number of members about the euro, and discussion about whether its current value really reflected the strength of the eurozone economy But the exchange rate is not a target, he says firmly (a familiar line from the Central Bankers\u2019 handbook) Draghi then circles back to the first question -- saying there was a \u201cvery preliminary\u201d discussion about the bank\u2019s asset purchase scheme, and the pros and cons of different scenarios. We want to see the work from the committees who are tasked to work on this, he adds, before taking any decisions. In conclusion, Draghi repeats the ECB\u2019s pledge to leave interest rates at their present or lower rate for an extended period. Putting on his serious voice, Draghi declares that the implementation of structural reforms needs to be stepped up. That\u2019s a nudge to Europe\u2019s politicians to do their bit. Newsflash: The ECB has raised its growth forecast for 2017, and cut its inflation forecast in 2018 and 2019. Draghi sound cautious on inflation, saying that \u2018core inflation\u2019 has yet to show a convincing pickup. Headline inflation could turn negative towards the end of the year, he adds. That could be a signal that the ECB is taking a dovish view, and will be reluctant to tighten monetary policy. But the euro is rising...to $1.1992 (up 0.7 of a cent today). Boom! Draghi says that the ECB will decide on the \u201ccalibration\u201d of its policy beyond 2017 later this year. That confirms that the governing council hasn\u2019t made a decision on how to taper its stimulus programme yet. Despite the recovery, the eurozone still needs a \u201cvery substantial degree of monetary support\u201d, Draghi continues. Hello! Draghi says that ECB is watching the euro\u2019s volatility carefully, as it is a source of uncertainty. ECB president Mario Draghi begins his press conference by reading out today\u2019s statement (details here). He says that ECB\u2019s outlook for the eurozone economy is \u201cbroadly unchanged\u201d; a \u201cbroad-based\u201d recovery is underway across all countries and sectors. It\u2019s Mario time.... Reuters correspondent Francesco Canepa reckons the strength of the euro deterred the ECB from tightening monetary policy today.... City traders will now be scrambling for a quick sandwich before the main event of the day, Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference in 30 minutes Although today\u2019s statement was unchanged, Draghi could still surprise us when he\u2019s asked about the ECB\u2019s thinking around its stimulus programme. Plus, we\u2019ll get those new inflation and GDP forecasts. Fred Ducrozet of Pictet bank suspects that Draghi will reveal that ECB staff are working on possible QE changes. Kerim Derhalli, CEO and founder of investing app Invstr, says the ECB was right to leave interest rates on hold. \u201cThe ECB is conscious of lagging inflation rates and will not want to see a further rise in the Euro for fear of stifling economic recovery, which is largely driven by Germany\u2019s export performance\u201d Today\u2019s statement from the European Central Bank may sound curiously familiar. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not a case of deja vu. The ECB has simply repeated July\u2019s statement, while taking the time to tweak the date. It\u2019s official, the European Central Bank has not made any changes to its stimulus programme. Instead, it is maintaining its promise to buy \u20ac60bn of new bonds each month until at least the end of December 2017. And it also promises to boost the programme if needed, to keep inflation on track. Here\u2019s the key part of the statement: Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of \u20ac60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the programme in terms of size and/or duration. The ECB also says that it expects to leave its interest rate at their present levels \u201cfor an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases\u201d. That\u2019s not a change of policy, though. Breaking! The European Central Bank has left interest rates unchanged across the eurozone, at their current record lows. That means the headline borrowing cost remains at 0.0%. And banks will still be charged a negative interest rate, of minus 0.4%, when they leave money in the ECB\u2019s electronic vaults. That is meant to encourage them to lend to consumers and businesses. But what about QE?..... European stock markets are still up, too: With the ECB\u2019s decision just moments away, the euro is up 0.5% against the US dollar at $1.1975. Here\u2019s a reminder of what the markets are looking for from the ECB today: 1) What\u2019s the QE plan? Traders want to hear clues about how the ECB will handle its bond-buying programme beyond December. Currently it is buying \u20ac60bn of bonds per month; will we hear plans to taper it in January? 2) Will Draghi express any concern about the strong euro? Famously the exchange rate isn\u2019t a formal target, but that might not prevent the ECB president pointing out that a higher exchange rate can push down inflation. 3) What are the new staff forecasts? ECB economists have been beavering away for weeks, drawing up new growth and inflation projections. They should influence (but not dictate) how the ECB plots its actions over the next few months. 4) Will it change its QE parameters? Put simply, the ECB is running out of bonds to buy, having energetically stimulating the eurozone economy since early 2015. A rule change could give it more leeway to buy debt from certain countries. Tensions is mounting.... European stock markets are pushing higher, with traders citing relief that America has avoided the danger of a default later this month. Wall Street and the City have been cheered by the (rare) sight of Donald Trump clinching a deal with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, to extend the debt ceiling by three months. Peter Rosenstreich of Swissquote bank says the deal may show that Trump can get things done after all: The real news was Trump working with Democrats. In rare bipartisan deal, Trump, Republicans and Democrats extended the U.S. debt limit and provided government funding until Dec. 15th. Should the Republican-led Congress pass the bill, the 3-month deal would prevent an extraordinary default on U.S. government debt and keep the government funded for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. This was a massive first step. True, it was tied to relief assistance for victims of Hurricane Harvey, but still, the path towards meaningful tax reform (and potentially other stimulus) just got a little less steep. We were perhaps premature in writing off the Trump pro-growth, reflation story \u2013 a shift to the center, highlighted by this 3-month extension, could be the start of something real. A unified US government could have profound effects on our market outlook. Emmanuel Macron has touched down in Athens to begin his visit to the Greek capital... Higher still and higher goes the euro.... That means there\u2019s further to fall if the ECB fails to make any new decisions on its stimulus programme today. Over in Athens, draconian security measures are being taken ahead of the French president Emmanuel Macron making his first official visit to the the country. More than 2,000 police officers have been seconded around the city centre - including 700 special forces - as Greece prepares to lay out red carpet for the leader of the country that he stood by it throughout the euro zone crisis. Helena Smith reports from Athens The French president is due to arrive at Athens\u2019 international airport, accompanied by his wife Brigitte, his economy and Europe ministers and the CEO\u2019s of 40 investment-hungry French companies (from the French energy company Total to small independent start-ups) at 1:30pm local time. A massive security operation, on a par with that put in place when the former US president Barack Obama visited the Greek capital last November, has gone into action - with sirens going off in the Greek capital already. The stepped up measures come as police hunt for the perpetrators of an attack on the French Institute last night. Two men on a motorbike are believed to have thrown black pain at the building late around 10 PM - the second such attack in the last year. The two-day visit is being seen as perhaps the most important trip by a foreign leader to Greece this year with government sources describing it as having huge symbolic capital for both countries. \u201cThe future of Europe, investment programs, the country\u2019s debt load and how we can boost growth will all be on the table,\u201d a government source told the Guardian. Macron will become the first foreign leader to give an address from the ancient Pnyx - where Pericles made his famous funeral oration - this evening. The theme will be Europe and his vision for the continent. Meanwhile the French leader has sent a message of support to the country ahead of the visit, in which he has spoken of the nation\u2019s ability to exit its long-running debt crisis. Greece\u2019s ejection from the euro zone was unthinkable, he told the leading Greek daily Kathimerini. \u201cA Greek exit would signal, sooner or later, the end of the euro ... the best way to avoid the exit of any member state is to draw up an ambitious plan.\u201d Here\u2019s a chart showing the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery: New figures have confirmed that the eurozone economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter of this year. Britain and Portugal were the slowest members, with both economies growing by just 0.3% between April and June. Other countries sparkled, though; the Czech Republic grew by a blistering 2.5% in the quarter, followed by Sweden with 1.7% growth. Eurostat, which compiled the data, reports that household spending rose by 0.5% in the euro area, while investment (or \u2018gross fixed capital formation\u2019) rose by 0.9%. Exports rose by 1.1% in the euro area, while imports increased by 0.9%. Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research, warns that the euro could tumble if Mario Draghi is more cautious than expected today. He writes: We don\u2019t expect Mario to come out swinging today, but it may only require a tweak of CPI projections, casual reference of a high Euro or hint that QE normalisation talks are underway which could whip markets into a frenzy. If ECB were to downgrade economic projections, it would be in line with Draghi\u2019s doubt that Europe\u2019s reflationary run remains self-sustainable. Markets would likely take this as strong clue that QE normalisation is pushed well back into 2018 and Euro could find itself under remarkable pressure.\u201d Excitingly, there\u2019s no clear consensus on what the European Central Bank will do at today\u2019s meeting. Several experts think the decision on its stimulus progamme could be delayed until October, while the ECB is also expected to raise its growth forecasts and cut its inflation ones. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets expects Mario Draghi to confirm that the governing council discussed how to trim, or taper, its bond purchasing scheme. We have less than four months left before the ECB asset purchase program ends, and the president of the ECB, Mario Draghi is reticent about the future path of the monetary policy. Month after month, the tapering process has been delayed while the recovery in the Eurozone has strengthened. The patient is not sick and there is no need for the lifeline.... Forget about pulling a rabbit out of the hat, when it comes to the ECB\u2019s meeting on Thursday, I expect the statement to be immensely tailor-made. It is widely expected that the ECB would say that they have officially discussed the process of tapering in the light of their latest economic projections. Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi predicts that the ECB will delay the big decision on slowing its stimulus programme until next month. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, says the ECB could pull the trigger on QE today. \u201cECB president Mario Draghi will give his most keenly awaited speech for a while this lunchtime as traders bet whether he\u2019ll finally confirm plans to cool the central bank\u2019s stimulus programme. \u201cWith the eurozone economy growing consistently and inflation higher, there\u2019s certainly a strong argument to reduce monthly bond-buying from the current \u20ac60 billion. However, with the euro still firmly above $1.19, there\u2019s a strong feeling that Draghi will delay any decision until October at the earliest.\u201d Claus Vistesen of Pantheon Macroeconomics predicts that the ECB will cut its inflation forecasts -- which seems plausible, as the euro has strengthened since June. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says the strengthening euro has complicated the ECB\u2019s dilemma: The crucial question facing the ECB is whether Mario Draghi will announce the date of cutting bond purchases. The decision to taper asset purchases was widely expected to occur in today\u2019s meeting, after Mr. Draghi hinted on 20 July that the discussion on tapering assets should take place in Autumn. Since then, the Euro has appreciated by more than 4.8% against the dollar, but declined slightly after peaking at $1.2069. Technically, the Autumn season starts towards the end of September, so even if Mr. Draghi decided to delay the announcement of tapering the asset purchase program, this wouldn\u2019t affect his credibility. However, the day of the announcement isn\u2019t the only key driver of the Euro\u2019s direction; it\u2019s the game plan going forward. The euro is continuing to rise against the US dollar, as traders wonder whether the ECB will take a decision on tapering its stimulus programme today. Surprise! British house prices rose by a positively perky 1.1% in August, according to the Halifax\u2019s monthly survey. That\u2019s the highest reading in eight months. However, prices are still only 0.1% higher over the last quarter as a whole, following a decline in June. The annual rate (a better measure) came at +2.6%, compared to 2.1% a month ago. It touched 10% back in 2016, before tailing off recently. Newsflash from Sweden: The Riksbank has left interest rates unchanged at their current record low of -0.5%. European stock markets have opened a little higher, with the FTSE 100 gaining 11 points or 0.15%. The euro is creeping higher in early trading, up 0.2% to $1.1935, as traders await news from the ECB. This table from ING shows how the euro could react to today\u2019s decisions. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a big day for the eurozone, as the European Central Bank meets to set monetary policy. Top of the agenda - how, and when, to end the stimulus programme that is pumping more than \u20ac2 trillion into the euro economy. Back in July, ECB president Mario Draghi promised us a decision on its quantitative easing programme \u2018in the fall, or in the autumn\u2019. And with the nights drawing in, the issue needs to be tackled soon. Currently, the ECB is committed to buying \u20ac60bn of government and corporate bonds each month with newly created money, until the end of 2017. So economists and traders are eager to know what will happen when the clock ticks past midnight on December 31. It\u2019s possible that the ECB will decide to trim the pace of the programme, perhaps to \u20ac40bn per month from January, in an attempt to wean the markets off its stimulus without causing a crash. BUT... we might not get the big decision today. The ECB could defer the decision until its October meeting, leaving us in suspense for a few more weeks. Draghi may also take the opportunity to talk about the strength of the euro, which hit an eight-year high against the pound last month. Konstantinos Anthis in the ADS Securities research team reckons Draghi has three options. The first is that the ECB will announce a full-scale tapering of their purchases by 50 billion which would give a massive push to the Euro that will rally towards $1.21 and also change its outlook to clearly positive. The second option is that the ECB will announce a smaller scale reduction of their program - possibly by 20 billion or so - which would be positive for the single currency, and could send the euro above $1.20 but the mixed reaction from the market would mean that gains would be capped; and finally the third possibility would be the ECB postpones the tapering for a month or more which would be clearly negative for the euro and would send it tumbling towards or even below $1.18. So we can expect plenty of volatility when the ECB shows its hand. There\u2019s no chance that the governing council will raise interest rates from their current record lows, despite Deutsche Bank\u2019s CEO calling for the end of \u2018cheap money\u2019 yesterday. The ECB will also publish its new growth and inflation forecasts today, for the first time since June. There\u2019s chatter that it could raise its growth predictions a little, but trim its inflation outlook. The financial markets look calm this morning, with some relief that a short-term deal has been hammered out on the US debt ceiling  . We also get a new survey of UK house prices this morning, which could show if the market is cooling. Plus, updated eurozone growth figures which will probably confirm that the region expanded by a punchy 0.6% in the April to June quarter.

A rule change could give it more leeway to buy debt from certain countries.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59b12397e4b0fed267af1da9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-07T10:46:58.645Z\">11.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Tensions is mounting....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ToddBuell/status/905744027898839041\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One hour to go <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ecb?src=hash\">#ecb</a></p>&mdash; Todd Buell (@ToddBuell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToddBuell/status/905744027898839041\">September 7, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59b11e6be4b0fed267af1d79\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-09-07T10:35:13.789Z\">11.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Market cheer US debt ceiling deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>European stock markets are pushing higher, with traders citing relief that America has avoided the danger of a default later this month.</strong></p> <p>Wall Street and the City have been cheered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/06/trump-ignores-republicans-on-democrats-debt-limit-and-harvey-funds-plan\">the (rare) sight of Donald Trump clinching a deal with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, to extend the debt ceiling by three months</a>.</p> <p><strong>Peter Rosenstreich </strong>of<strong> Swissquote b</strong>ank says the deal may show that Trump can get things done after all:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The real news was Trump working with Democrats. In rare bipartisan deal, Trump, Republicans and Democrats extended the U.S. debt limit and provided government funding until Dec. 15th. Should the Republican-led Congress pass the bill, the 3-month deal would prevent an extraordinary default on U.S. government debt and keep the government funded for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. </p> <p>This was a massive first step. True, it was tied to relief assistance for victims of Hurricane Harvey, but still, the path towards meaningful tax reform (and potentially other stimulus) just got a little less steep. We were perhaps premature in writing off the Trump pro-growth, reflation story \u2013 a shift to the center, highlighted by this 3-month extension, could be the start of something real.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Increases in payouts to victims of car crashes and botched operations are to be scaled back after a furious backlash by the insurance industry against Ministry of Justice plans. In a significant U-turn by ministers, changes to the so-called \u201cOgden rate\u201d used to calculate compensation payouts are to be revised, after insurers said they would inflate car insurance premiums by hundreds of pounds. When the government cut the rate from 2.5% to -0.75% in February in a surprise move, there was an outcry from insurers. After a consultation, the Ministry of Justice has proposed a rate of between 0% and 1% in draft legislation. The change appears small, but the mathematical implications for payouts can be very significant. When the new Ogden rate was imposed in February, insurers said the compensation figure for a brain injury on a 25-year-old could soar from \u00a33m to \u00a38m, and that the NHS and other parts of the public sector could face an extra \u00a36bn bill. Shares in insurance companies rose on news of the Ogden reform, with Direct Line closing up more than 2%. The formula is used to calculate lump sum compensation payments to people with serious injuries, to ensure inflation does not erode the future value of a payout. The lower the rate, the higher the lump sum. Insurers had argued that the February change would overcompensate victims of car crashes, although personal injury lawyers said a new rate was vital to ensure that victims received proper care and compensation. Mohammad Khan, UK general insurance leader at auditing group PricewaterhouseCoopers, said car insurance premiums rose by \u00a375 on average and by \u00a3250 for young drivers after the February change. Premiums were expected to rise by a further \u00a3100 on average, or \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 for young drivers, in November and December, as insurers planned to pass their increased costs on in full. Assuming the revised Odgen rate becomes law, premiums should stay stable in coming months, or could even fall. Tony Sault, UK general insurance leader for consultancy firm EY, said: \u201cWe would expect the recent rise in premiums to level off in anticipation of the new legislation, and ultimately premiums could fall between 2% and 4%, saving up to \u00a321 on the average premium to the consumer.\u201d For people with serious injuries it is bad news as payouts will be lower than expected. Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, said: \u201cThe discount rate must be set to meet the needs of catastrophically injured people. Someone with a life-long, life-changing injury such as brain damage or a spinal injury cannot afford to take any risks with how his/her compensation is invested.\u201d He added: \u201cThis rate was wrong for many years and it has been cut right recently ... We need to examine the detail. We need to focus on meeting the needs of the injured person with 100% certainty.\u201d Lawyers are also pressing the government for more clarity. Sarah Stanton, partner at law firm Moore Blatch, said: \u201cUntil the timetable of this legislation is clarified, the value of the compensation that claimants can seek in the most serious cases will remain uncertain. \u201cWe welcomed the decision to reduce the Ogden rate from 2.5% to -0.75% this year \u2013 a long overdue change that corrected the balance in compensation, in favour of the victims of serious injuries.\u201d The AA gave a \u201ccautious welcome\u201d to the Ogden re-set. Its director of insurance, Michael Lloyd, said: \u201cThe new rate must be adjusted to set a realistic and fair rate for both victims and insurers. \u201cThis draft legislation is being put before parliament, but there\u2019s no guarantee that it will be enacted. \u201cWe predicted in July that as a consequence of these entirely avoidable government-prompted increases including a doubling of insurance premium tax over the past couple of years, more young drivers would risk illegal ways of getting behind the wheel and sadly, that has come to pass.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Jaguar Land Rover to make only electric or hybrid cars from 2020", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover has become the latest large carmaker to say it will stop launching new models solely powered by internal combustion engines, two months after Volvo pledged to do so. The UK-based manufacturer promised that all new models from 2020 will be fully electric or hybrid, a year later than Volvo\u2019s target, but a big step beyond its unveiling last November of a single electric concept car. The plan comes after the Scottish government said it would phase out the need for petrol and diesel cars by 2032, eight years earlier than the UK and French targets of banning sales of new cars with internal combustion engines. Dr Ralf Speth, JLR\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cEvery new Jaguar Land Rover model line will be electrified from 2020, giving our customers even more choice.\u201d But Speth also warned of the unintended consequences of the electrification of cars and arrival of autonomous vehicles. The UK\u2019s 250,000-plus lorry drivers are at risk from driverless technology, with knock-on effects for the UK\u2019s social fabric, he said. \u201cIn the UK, there are currently more than a quarter of a million lorry drivers. What happens to our society if these lose their jobs? Who pays for them? What happens to the social fabric of the country?\u201d Furthermore, electric cars\u2019 impact on petrol and diesel demand could hurt oil-producing nations, Speth said. \u201cMany could be forced to impose substantial spending cuts within the next five years, straining living standards and so creating unrest in areas already suffering from instability,\u201d he added. Protecting privacy in an era of self-driving cars would also be vital, he said. \u201cThe very technology that could liberate us, autonomous vehicles, could become a method of insecurity and enslavement \u2026 Big freedoms could end up creating the big brother state.\u201d While Speth has said he sees battery-powered cars as a way to grow its global workforce of 40,000, the high emissions of the carmaker\u2019s petrol and diesel vehicles mean it has to go electric to meet stringent new European carbon targets. Average CO2 emissions from JLR cars were 164g (5.8oz) per kilometre in 2015, well above the UK average of 121.4g. More importantly, they are a long way from the 95g target a manufacturer must hit by 2021. Prof David Bailey, an automotive expert at Aston University, said the company had been slow to wake up to electric vehicles. \u201cJaguar are playing catchup \u2013 Tesla has stolen a chunk of their lunch, BMW are way ahead as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe premium end of things is moving more quickly [towards electrification] in part because electric car costs are higher at the moment because of battery costs, so they can absorb that. It\u2019s also because they are heavily dependent on diesel and the market is moving away from diesel.\u201d JLR, a subsidiary of the Indian conglomerate Tata, makes no electric cars but plans to begin building production versions of its battery-powered SUV next year. The I-Pace will have a range of 310 miles (500km), putting it on a par with competition from US-based Tesla but ahead of cheaper options such as the new Nissan Leaf, unveiled on Wednesday. JLR has indicated that it would like to build an electric car plant in the UK, similar to Nissan\u2019s Sunderland facility, where the Leaf is built, but it has yet to make a concrete commitment. The Leaf is the UK\u2019s bestselling electric model, and this week Nissan revealed its new design and an extended, 235-mile range. Such a move would be a significant boost to the British car industry and follows BMW, which in July pledged to build its electric Mini in Oxford. Jaguar sold more than 583,000 cars in 136 countries last year. Industry watchers had spotted earlier this year that JLR had trademarked a series of car names that suggested an electric future, although the company will continue to build existing petrol and diesel models beyond 2020. Speth told an audience in London that JLR could not pursue its electric ambitions alone, questioning whether the government was doing enough on infrastructure. \u201cWhere is the network of charging points that [electric cars] will require to function? Indeed, where is the power grid that will allow us to build them?\u201d he said. Ministers on Thursday announced the launch of a new industry-and-government-backed brand to develop driverless vehicles in the UK. The Meridian hub will coordinate research and development into the technology, paid for by carmakers and \u00a3100m in public funding. BMW, which has sold 8,000 electric cars in the UK, said on Thursday that it plans to have 25 electrified vehicles on sale by 2025, a dozen of which would be fully electric. The German carmaker boasted that the models would have a range of up to 435 miles, more than double the range of most current electric vehicles. Governments keen to tackle air pollution and cut carbon emissions are driving electric car production, alongside falling battery prices. However, a report found that on average, 1.7% of carmakers\u2019 sales were electric vehicles, compared with their own target of 3.6%. The state of electric cars How many electric cars are there? While electric cars make up less than 1% of new car sales worldwide, there are now more than 2m on the road. Most of them \u2013 90% \u2013 are sold in China, the US and the EU, although some countries are racing ahead, such as Norway, where nearly a third of new cars sold are electric. The key thing is the rate of growth. In the UK, sales of fully electric cars are up 51% this year to date, compared with registrations in 2016. What is driving their growing popularity? Government policy, such as European targets for new cars\u2019 carbon emissions and Chinese subsidies for electric cars, as leaders attempt to solve urban air quality problems and tackle climate change. In November, the EU will discuss tough new carbon targets for 2025, with some campaigners calling for manufacturers to be set a target on the proportion of battery-powered cars they sell. The other big reason is that the cost of car batteries has fallen fast. Costs dropped from $1,000 (\u00a3763) per kilowatt-hour of capacity in 2010 to around $300 last year, with some companies edging towards $150, according to Dutch bank ING. Finally, there is now real competition between carmakers trying to outdo one another \u2013 expect more rhetoric and pledges at the Frankfurt motor show next week. What\u2019s the state of the technology? \u201cThe technology is ready. The ranges are getting longer and new models are being put on the road,\u201d said Julia Hildermeier of campaigners Transport &amp; Environment. The group counted 20 fully electric models on sale in Europe last year, rising to 48 if plug-in hybrids are included. However, there were more than 400 petrol and diesel models. The new generation of electric cars can also go further between charges \u2013 around 200 miles, or more than 300 in the case of premium models. Next up are lorries and freight. Later this month, the US-based Tesla is reportedly planning to announce an electric truck with a range of up to 300 miles.",

The claimant is a potential witness to any internal and external investigation or inquiry conducted by Her Majesty\u2019s government/inspectorate into alleged widespread abuse by G4S staff against detainees at Brook House committed over a significant period of time and in the immigration detention estate more widely. \u201cMoreover, the claimant is also a potential witness to any criminal proceedings that may flow from the abuse reported and evidenced at Brook House and/or which he himself endured.\u201d Mr Justice Lavender noted that the man had not yet made a claim for damages, but in his order preventing deportation he said: \u201cThe argument that the applicant should not be removed while he pursues his threatened claim for damages may merit further consideration and therefore justifies some interim relief.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWhere a decision has been made that a person does not require international protection, and there are no remaining rights of appeal or obstacles to their return, we expect individuals to return voluntarily to their home country.\u201d The move to deport the man comes days after the BBC aired a damning Panorama documentary which used undercover filming to expose abuse by some G4S guards who manage Brook House. Ten have been suspended in relation to the BBC revelations. \u201cThings are very bad in Brook House,\u201d the man said. \u201cI was recently summoned to a meeting with a Home Office official in Brook House, and before I went into the meeting I was searched by G4S to see if I had any drugs or weapons on me. \u201cI don\u2019t take drugs, I don\u2019t even smoke and I don\u2019t have any weapons. G4S know that, but they really roughed me up in the search. I was very afraid. They mocked me and they scrunched up the file of documents about my case that I was carrying to take into the meeting with the Home Office officials. I didn\u2019t bother to make a complaint about it because when detainees make complaints they go nowhere.\u201d He had witnessed a lot of abuse of detainees by G4S since he was brought to Brook House on 28 June, he said. The man\u2019s solicitor, Sheroy Zaq of Duncan Lewis, said: \u201cThis case concerns a man who was persecuted in his country of origin. He has since been subjected to further inhumane and degrading treatment within immigration detention, the responsibility for which falls squarely at the feet of our home secretary and G4S. \u201cIt is somewhat sinister that the date upon which the home secretary decided that this client could be removed was the same date that the BBC aired its documentary concerning the level of abuse suffered by detainees at Brook House IRC. The complaints of our client as to the abuse that he has been subjected to are to date unanswered, and no doubt would have remained as such in the event that this injunction was not granted by the High Court on the eve of his proposed removal.\u201d Two notices have been circulated to Brook House detainees as a result of the Panorama expos\u00e9, one asking them to attend feedback meetings with management and the other warning of severe consequences for anyone found in possession of drugs. Brook House, which holds up to 508 adult male detainees, was designed to take people for 72 hours, but some detainees have been held for months or even years.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unilever, owner of PG Tips and Liptons, is increasing its presence in the herbal tea market by acquiring Bristol-based Pukka Herbs. Sebastian Pole and Tim Westwell, founders of the brand known for its exotic flavours such as turmeric gold and mint matcha as well as cleansing and detox teas, have sold the business to Unilever for an undisclosed sum. The pair have agreed to stay on to help drive global expansion. Mick van Ettinger, head of tea at Unilever, said Pukka was the fastest-growing organic tea brand in the world and offered a \u201cbeautiful and great growth opportunity\u201d by using the Anglo-Dutch group\u2019s network to increase distribution. The sale is likely to raise fears that the independent ethical brand will lose its values after being taken over by a transnational corporation. But Pole said Pukka had agreed \u201csolid iron-clad commitments\u201d from Unilever to stand by its ethical standards including 100% organic, \u201cfair for life\u201d Fairtrade and FairWild accreditation for wild collected herbs. \u201cPukka will remain exactly the same but just be able to reach more people and have a greater environmental impact,\u201d he said, adding that the pair had chosen to sell to Unilever partly because of its commitment to sustainability as well as social and environmental change. Unilever\u2019s acquisition comes as Brits are buying less traditional black tea. The volume of sales fell by about 1.6% in the past year, according to analysts Kantar Worldpanel, while fruit, green and herbal tea sales are rising by 2.8% in volume and 6.8% in value. The value of black tea sales is rising again after five years of decline, according to trade magazine the Grocer, partly because of inflation caused by the weak value of the pound but also as people switch to upmarket brews. In this changing market, big brands such as PG Tips have found some of their products delisted by supermarkets in favour of the likes of Pukka, Teapigs or Twinings. The company has responded by purchasing the T2 Australian tea brand and launching its new Pure Leaf variety before acquiring Pukka. Van Ettinger said the market was changing with consumers of all ages looking for beverages to suit different needs. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that people don\u2019t look at tea as one drink now in one moment. They are discovering tea as a magical product that does different things at different times of day,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the morning a lot of people still drink black tea as it picks you up, but in the afternoon or evening herbal tea is wonderful with different benefits.\u201d He said Unilever wanted a range of teas to serve people in different moments. Pole, a herbalist, and Westwell, a business consultant who had been involved in marketing computer systems, set up Pukka in 2001 after meeting through a small ad in a Bristol magazine. Westwell\u2019s offer of \u201csales and marketing expertise to help your business grow wealthy in a sustainable and healthy way\u201d received only one reply. The pair each invested \u00a32,500 of their savings, asked Pole\u2019s wife and friends to invest and borrowed \u00a310,000 from the bank to start the firm. The brand now has sales of about \u00a330m, controlling just over a fifth of the UK fruit and herbal tea market as well as selling around the world, with Germany and the US its main export countries. The company employs 110 people in Bristol and next spring is to move into Cadbury\u2019s former Somerdale factory in Keynsham, abandoned after the chocolate maker was taken over by US firm Kraft in 2010. It uses up to 160 herbs grown by a few thousand mostly small-scale farmers in 30 countries. Last year Pukka made a pre-tax loss of \u00a324,000, down from a \u00a3233,000 loss the year before. Westwell said the company did not expect to become profitable for another few years but this was part of a five-year plan. The company has been investing in marketing and distribution to drive its expansion plans. \u201cWe have to invest to grow,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "UK house prices rising amid shortage of properties, says Halifax", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK house price growth unexpectedly picked up last month, underpinned by strong employment growth and a shortage of properties on the market, according to Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. The average price of a house rose by 1.1% to \u00a3222,293 in August, said Halifax, which is owned by Lloyds Banking Group. Prices in the three months to August were 2.6% higher than a year earlier, up from an annual rate of 2.1% in the three months to July, which was a four-year low. Annual price growth has slowed from a peak of 10% in March 2016. The figures were surprising, as other surveys have suggested a slowdown in the housing market. Affordability is an issue as household incomes are being squeezed, with inflation outstripping wage growth, but this has been countered by low unemployment, low mortgage rates and a shortage of properties for sale. Russell Galley, the Halifax managing director, said: \u201cRecent figures for mortgage approvals suggest some buoyancy may be returning, possibly on the back of strong recent employment growth, with the unemployment rate falling to a 42-year low.\u201d Halifax noted that UK home sales have exceeded 100,000 for seven months running. Between June and July they edged up to 104,760, the highest level since March 2016, according to HMRC figures. The other closely watched monthly house price index, from Nationwide, Britain\u2019s biggest building society, showed house prices dipped 0.1% between July and August, reducing the annual growth rate to 2.1%. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) residential chairman, warned against being carried away by the Halifax figures. \u201cIt is worth remembering that house price growth is being underpinned by a shortage of supply, including housebuilding, historically low mortgage rates and relatively low unemployment, rather than strong buyer demand. Fewer transactions are taking place where affordability has been most stretched due to lack of new and existing stock \u2013 such as in London \u2013 and inflation higher than wage growth. \u201cThe short-term impact of Brexit on the housing market was probably overestimated but the longer-term effects may have been underestimated. However, now that the government is negotiating the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, further uncertainty seems inevitable until the final outcome becomes clearer.\u201d Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the pick-up in house price growth \u201cshould not be mistaken for underlying momentum\u201d. He noted that Halifax\u2019s measure rose by just 0.1% on a three-month-on-three-month basis. Tombs added: \u201cHouse purchase demand undeniably has weakened recently \u2014 Rics has reported falling new buyer inquiries in five of the last six months \u2014 as the real wage squeeze has intensified and consumer confidence has deteriorated. We expect demand to weaken further before the end of this year as the real wage squeeze worsens and lenders follow through on plans to tighten lending criteria.\u201d",

Affordability is an issue as household incomes are being squeezed, with inflation outstripping wage growth, but this has been countered by low unemployment, low mortgage rates and a shortage of properties for sale.</p> <p>Russell Galley, the Halifax managing director, said: \u201cRecent figures for mortgage approvals suggest some buoyancy may be returning, possibly on the back of strong recent employment growth, with the unemployment rate falling to a 42-year low.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/sep/05/help-to-buy-scheme-buyers-builders-subsidy\">Help-to-buy scheme aids some buyers, but boosts builders even more | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Halifax noted that UK home sales have exceeded 100,000 for seven months running. Between June and July they edged up to 104,760, the highest level since March 2016, according to HMRC figures.</p> <p>The other closely watched monthly house price index, from Nationwide, Britain\u2019s biggest building society, showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/29/house-prices-dip-sign-cooling-uk-economy\">house prices dipped 0.1% between July and August</a>, reducing the annual growth rate to 2.1%.</p> <p>Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) residential chairman, warned against being carried away by the Halifax figures.</p> <p>\u201cIt is worth remembering that house price growth is being underpinned by a shortage of supply, including housebuilding, historically low mortgage rates and relatively low unemployment, rather than strong buyer demand. Fewer transactions are taking place where affordability has been most stretched due to lack of new and existing stock \u2013 such as in London \u2013 and inflation higher than wage growth.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2017-09-07T16:01:07/embed.html\" data-alt=\"house price growth\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/sep/2017-09-07T16:01:07/embed.html\">house price growth</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe short-term impact of Brexit on the housing market was probably overestimated but the longer-term effects may have been underestimated. However, now that the government is negotiating the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, further uncertainty seems inevitable until the final outcome becomes clearer.\u201d</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, a UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the pick-up in house price growth \u201cshould not be mistaken for underlying momentum\u201d.</p> <p>He noted that Halifax\u2019s measure rose by just 0.1% on a three-month-on-three-month basis.</p> <p>Tombs added: \u201cHouse purchase demand undeniably has weakened recently \u2014 Rics has reported falling new buyer inquiries in five of the last six months \u2014 as the real wage squeeze has intensified and consumer confidence has deteriorated. We expect demand to weaken further before the end of this year as the real wage squeeze worsens and lenders follow through on plans to tighten lending criteria.\u201d</p>",

Ending the partnership \u2013 which offers savings, credit cards and mortgages through the Post Office brand \u2013 and buying the Dublin-based bank\u2019s Post Office assets would cost up to \u00a32bn, according to research from Cass Business School on behalf of the Communication Workers Union. Doing this would help boost profits at the network, removing the need for government money in the long-run. Prof Barbara Casu Lukac, author of the report, said: \u201cMost people are probably not aware they\u2019re buying Bank of Ireland products, because they buy it at the Post Office. Buying the banking business would help the Post Office to remain self-funding.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time the government has been urged to tear up its contract with the Bank of Ireland, while the latest calls also follow several attempts in recent years to get the government to create a state-owned \u201cPost Bank\u201d. Many European countries, including Italy and France, operate banks through their postal operators. The Labour party also included the establishment of a commission to create a Post Bank in its election manifesto. The plan could also represent a return to the days of the old Giro Bank, a \u201cpeople\u2019s bank\u201d started by Harold Wilson in the 1960s through the Post Office but later sold off by Margaret Thatcher in the late 1980s. Creating a bank would offset the closure of branches by major high street lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, while also helping small firms to access financial services, according to the Cass study. Banks are set to close a record 762 branches this year, depriving rural communities of local facilities. The report argues the Bank of Ireland lacks the ability to invest substantially in the Post Office. That has prevented the firm from establishing small business lending, while it\u2019s also struggled to roll out current accounts, Lukac said. Dave Ward, general secretary of the CWU, said the Post Office network \u201cgives it huge potential for growth and to provide banking services\u201d to small firms and financially excluded communities. \u201cWe would urge the government and the Post Office to act on the report\u2019s recommendations,\u201d he said. A spokesman for Bank of Ireland said the lender has a \u201clong-established and successful financial services partnership\u201d with the Post Office, dating back over a number of years and serving about 2.4 million customers. \u201cRegarding the report referred to, we have no comment to make,\u201d the spokesman added.",
