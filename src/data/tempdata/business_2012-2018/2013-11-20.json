      "bodyText": "A British firm which has found a way to produce industrial quantities of graphene, the wonder material expected to revolutionise the fields of medicine and manufacturing, saw its share price rise 40% during its stock market debut on Wednesday. Shareholders piled in to buy a slice of Applied Graphene Materials (AGM), which is based in Cleveland and was spun out of Durham University, in a float that was more than two times oversubscribed. Graphene, a substance isolated by Nobel prize-winning scientists at the University of Manchester in 2004, is a one-molecule-thick layer of graphite that is 20 times stronger than diamond and conducts electricity 20 times better than copper. It has already been used in tennis rackets and future applications range from aircraft bodies to membranes used in DNA sequencing. Graphene is difficult to make in large quantities, but AGM, which raised \u00a311m by selling a 42% stake, has found a way to mass produce the material in powder and is working with companies including Dyson and Procter &amp; Gamble to develop commercial uses for the material. \"This funding will allow us to begin the next phase of development and to strengthen relationships with our partners,\" said chief executive John Mabbitt. \"Applied Graphene Materials is now well positioned to meet the growing global appetite for graphene as a wonder material of the 21st century.\" The float on London's Aim market for smaller companies saw shares pop from the initial placing price of 155p to 216p by the close of the first day's trading, valuing the company at \u00a336m. AGM is forecast to become profitable in 2017. Founder and technical director Karl Coleman, professor of inorganic chemistry at Durham University, retains a 10% stake, having reduced his holding from 24% before the float. Early backer IP Group, which invests in patent-based businesses, has reinvested and retains a 20% stake. AGM will use the capital raised on Aim to expand the capacity of its Teesside production facility from one tonne a year to eight over the next 18 months. The company's 10-strong workforce will also increase, with engineers and scientists recruited to develop commercial applications for its products. Most graphene production relies on natural supplies of graphite, which has to be mined, but AGM has found a way to produce it using carbon atoms sourced from ethanol. Its product can then added to resins, plastics, oils and lubricants. Dyson wants to use graphene in the plastic casing for its vacuum cleaners, because of its strength, and because its ability to conduct electricity reduces static, which in turn helps the machine suck in more dust. Added to paints, graphene could help protect the hulls of boats from rust and, as a dry lubricant, reduce drag as the ship moves through water. While the UK pioneered the discovery of graphene, Asian companies have made the greatest efforts to commercialise it, with electronics giant Samsung leading the way. \"We [the British] are good with the initial materials, but other people are better at seeing applications ... We have to be careful with graphene, otherwise it is one of those things that we just let go,\" said Mabbitt.",

      "bodyText": "BSkyB would be \"keen\" to cut a sports wholesale deal with BT, chief executive Jeremy Darroch said in his first public comments since the telecoms company's \u00a3900m swoop on broadcast rights for Champions League football. \"It has to be a two way thing, so we'd want reciprocity in terms of supply,\" Darroch said on Wednesday. \"So if we can get there with BT, my position has always been very open to do that.\" Sky's share price fell 11% last week after it lost the rights it had shared with ITV to the Europa League soccer games, as investors reacted to the most serious challenge yet to Sky's dominance of sports broadcasting. Speaking in Barcelona at a conference organised by Morgan Stanley bank, Darroch reiterated his conditions for doing a deal with BT. Sky has withheld its premium sports channels from hundreds of thousands of viewers who have installed BT's new YouView box. Darroch is prepared to do a wholesale deal, allowing BT to sell Sky Sports 1 and 2 on YouView \u2013 but only if it is allowed to sell the BT Sports channels to its own satellite customers. BT Sports is available on satellite, but not via a Sky package \u2013 customers must sign up directly with BT. The telecoms group has signed more than 2m customers to its sports channels, with a further 2m Virgin Media homes receiving them automatically as part of their TV bundle. Darroch said Champions League accounted for less than 3% of viewing on Sky while cricket, tennis, Formula 1 and golf tournaments, as well as the Premier League, were a big part of its offer. \"There is a point at which the price that's paid is worth more than it is to our business and frankly that was the case with Champions League,\" said Darroch. Sky would be in good shape, he said, for the crucial auction for the next set of Premier League rights, which is expected at the end of 2014 or early in 2015. But Darroch sought to downplay the potential impact of BT's assault on sports, saying Sky now offered much more than football, and that it was now second only to BT in offering home broadband and phone services. \"While sports is important within Sky it's just one of the things we do. Our entertainment channels are working very well including our own investments in production and commissioning.\" A spokeswoman for BT said: \"We have always said we will wholesale BT Sport where it makes commercial sense for both parties. BT has always been open to reaching a commercial deal with Sky but they have resisted this to date.\"",

      "bodyText": "Three senior Ikea executives in France were put under investigation on Wednesday over allegations they spied on disgruntled customers and former staff. The head of Ikea France is among those accused of employing a firm of private detectives to snoop on individual employees, particularly union activists, job applicants and even unhappy customers, and of fraudulently obtaining personal information from police files. A judge decided there was enough evidence to formally mis en examen (the equivalent of being charged) Stefan Vanoverbeke, the chief executive of Ikea France, his predecessor Jean-Louis Baillo and chief financial officer Dariusz Rychert, who were arrested on Monday and held for questioning. Under French law, the men had to be formally put under investigation within 24 hours or freed. Since January, a total of 10 people have been arrested and put under investigation for \"fraudulent use of personal information\", including four police officers and Ikea's former head of security. The case is hugely damaging to the reputation of the flagship Swedish company famed for its family-friendly but infuriatingly difficult to assemble flat-pack furniture. The accused are said to have requested a range of personal data, including criminal records and confidential details about the targets' dealings with the police or courts, even as witnesses or victims. Scores of people were alleged to have been snooped on, including a union official. Last year, the satirical magazine Le Canard Enchain\u00e9 obtained and published emails allegedly between Ikea's management in France and S\u00fbret\u00e9 International suggesting the security company was obtaining information from the national police information system on behalf of Ikea. The magazine said Ikea agreed to pay S\u00fbret\u00e9 International \u20ac80 (\u00a366) for each request for information and that up to 200 demands were made at the same time. Two unions have filed legal complaints against Ikea, accusing it of snooping on hundreds of people over a period of at least five years. Among the claims is that Ikea asked investigators to find out if a customer, who was suing the company for \u20ac4,000 (\u00a33,350), owned her own property or was known to the police. Other accusations centre on the tracing of car registration numbers. Vanoverbek's lawyer, Alexis Gulbin, said his client denied involvement. \"It was he who took corrective measures as soon as the problems were detected,\" Gulbin said. Ikea France suspended and later fired the head of its risk management department last year along with three top-level executives, before publishing a new code of conduct. In a statement in 2012, Christophe Naudin, head of S\u00fbret\u00e9 International, told journalists last year it had \"consultancy and security contracts\" with Ikea, but flatly denied snooping for the firm. If found guilty of fraudulently using personal information, the accused face up to five years in prison and \u20ac300,000 in fines.",

In more than two hours of questioning they were accused of failing at their jobs and selling the taxpayer short.</p> <p>The government sold 60% of Royal Mail at 330p a share last month, valuing the company at \u00a33.3bn. But the shares leapt 38% on their first day of trading and closed tonight at 550p, giving Royal Mail a market value of \u00a35.5bn.</p> <p>Goldman, UBS and five other banks that marketed the shares have so far been paid \u00a312.7m between them but they could get another \u00a34.2m if Vince Cable, the secretary of state, thinks they warrant it.</p> <p>Bailey said: \"The government, in view of what has happened subsequently, would be mad to give them [the money].</p> <p>\"It would be seen as rewarding the private sector that lost the tax payer potentially \u00a31bn and in these days of austerity I think it would be a very politically dangerous thing to do.

You need to please the client/government, vendors, purchasers and shareholders and there are so many imponderables in pricing the value of a company \u2013 value of assets, distribution platform, political and economic considerations \u2013 home and abroad and the size of the IPO. Royal Mail is the largest IPO since 2006.</p> <p>The ability to place 600 million shares some with fund managers, some with the retail investor, 10% with the workforce with 30% remaining with the Government was no easy task. Some IPOs have fallen below this issue price. It was imperative that this did not happen to RMG.</p> <p>&#xa0;Richard Cormack of Goldman Sachs and James Robertson of UBS \u2013 both lead banks with Lazard Brothers - were given an extremely tough time by the chairman, Brian Binley and Mike Crockart aided and abetted by a more courteous and measured interrogation by Bill Bain, Robin Walker, Rebecca Harris and Katy Clark.....</p> <p>All the banks who were interrogated insisted that submitting an initial ranging valuation was totally different from a more exact IPO valuation. My colleague at Panmure, Gert Zonneveld gave an extremely good account of himself, refusing to get sucked in to any political nuances. He felt it was his responsibility to tell his clients that in his opinion this IPO offered extremely good value.....</p> <p>The committee was underwhelmed by some of the answers given. All investment banks present said a discount of between 10-15% was normal.&#xa0;</p> <p>The 38% premium on the first day\u2019s trading for RMG was unusual but 30 years ago BT traded at a 30% premium. I suspect there is little correlation between these two situations.&#xa0;</p> <p>Brian Binley suggested that Goldman and UBS had been incompetent in seriously undervaluing the company, thus stitching the taxpayer up. Cormack and Robertson were adamant that the Government accepted their advice. I suspect that next week Dr Cable and Michael Fallon can expect a real grilling.</p> </blockquote> <p>Buik also suggests a possible ulterior motive for the Royal Mail flotation not being priced higher -- the government has more asset sales on its agenda:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This IPO had to be a huge success to accommodate TSB, Lloyds and eventually RBS in the future.

Panmure's&#xa0;Gert Zonneveld was more independent than the rest, deftly puncturing claims that the Royal Mail share surge was froth by saying markets generally price companies quite well. But there was no real dissent in the ranks.</p> <p><strong>The session has certainly lined up Vince Cable for a robust inquisition next week. A few questions spring to mind for the Business Secretary to answer:</strong></p> <p><strong>1)</strong> Why were UBS and Goldman Sachs hired to handle the IPO, rather than JP Morgan, Citigroup or Deutsche Bank who all put a higher initial value on Royal Mail?</p> <p><strong>2</strong>) Why didn't he raise the float price to 350p in the final days, after being advised that the IPO price could be pushed up by 20p without puncturing demand?</p> <p><strong>3</strong>) Should he have postponed the float until America's debt ceiling crisis had been resolved, rather than launching the Royal Mail into a nervous market?</p> <p><strong>4)</strong> What criteria will Cable use to decide whether or not to give Goldman and UBS the \u00a34m outstanding payment? Does he believe they did a good job, or does he share Brian Binley's fears that they were duped by City investors?</p> <p><strong>5)</strong> Does he regret criticising&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/04/official-royal-mail-valuation-too-low\"><strong>Gert Zonneveld's prediction in early October</strong></a> that Royal Mail was worth a billion pounds more than the IPO price? Does he still believe there is froth clinging to the share price?</p> <p><strong>6)</strong>&#xa0;Why wasn't more attention given to Royal Mail's property portfolio? The committee were startled to hear that those initial valuations from the likes of JP Morgan did not include potential future windfalls from selling surplus assets.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-11-20T17:49:53.541Z\">at 5.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-528cd431e4b0ee99dadf9a80\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-20T15:26:53.139Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>During the session, The Times's correspondent Juliet Samuel tweeted a couple of highlights that I didn't manage to get into the blog:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CitySamuel/statuses/403107519197102080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>V surprising Goldman admit they don&#39;t even look up what institutions actually pay vs what they claim they&#39;d pay in negotiations <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23royalmail&amp;src=hash\">#royalmail</a></p>&mdash; Juliet Samuel (@CitySamuel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CitySamuel/statuses/403107519197102080\">November 20, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CitySamuel/statuses/403106487322804224\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Nadhim Zahawi love-in with bankers as he expostulates that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23royalmail&amp;src=hash\">#royalmail</a> price will take &quot;a long time to settle&quot;.

They tried to blame the threat of a US debt default, and the risk of strike action, for pushing down the final float price.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Goldman's Cormack insisted that the process of 'book-building' (attracting bids from interested investors) had been performed competently. \"I feel we executed the transaction well\", he said.</p> <p>But Binley was unconvinced, saying that he's learned early in his career that \"anyone can sell cheap beer\", the trick is to get the price right.</p> <p>Binley urged Goldman to rethink the way it handles IPOs, saying that it \"came up with the wrong answer\" and fed that rogue information to the government.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/20/royal-mail-bankers-face-grilling-at-parliament-business-live#block-528c900fe4b06b8a55a18764\">Under questioning</a>, UBS's Robertson said that the industrial unrest had been the main risk in the run-up to the float. The bankers attempted to persuade the committee that today's share price, of 538p right now, cannot be compared to the price at which you could shift 600 million shares.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>MPs also questioned whether the banks, which have already been paid over \u00a312m in fees, should receive an extra \u00a34m discretionary payment. </strong>It's up to the secretary of state, they replied. <em>Over to you, Vince...</em></p> <p>\u2022 <strong>UBS also revealed that in the final days ahead of the float, they had told the government that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/20/royal-mail-bankers-face-grilling-at-parliament-business-live#block-528c9e83e4b06b8a55a18771\">the price could be raised by another 20p before driving away demand</a>.</strong>&#xa0;That might have raised another \u00a3120m for the taxpayer. Robertson said, though, that such a move would have been rare and tricky.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Three investment banks who failed to be selected to handle the sale revealed that they had all valued the Royal Mail at more than the two banks who got the deal.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>JP Morgan has calculated that Royal Mail was worth up to&#xa0;<strong>\u00a38.5bn, </strong>while Citi had pitched a valuation of between <strong>\u00a35.9bn and \u00a36.5bn&#xa0;</strong>(<em>partly because it predicted a rather higher dividend payment than proved to be the case</em>). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/20/royal-mail-bankers-face-grilling-at-parliament-business-live#block-528c8392e4b06b8a55a1875e\"><strong>More details</strong></a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>MPs were also astonished to hear that these valuations did not even include the potential gains from future property sales.</strong> Apparently such information simply wasn't included.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up here, as postal workers around the UK crack on with processing tonight's mail for the morning. Our news story on today's hearing, just launched, is here: Royal Mail float: paying bankers' deferred fees would be 'mad', MP says Highlights of today's session at the BIS committee start here. My summary of the key points is here. There's reaction here, and again here. You can still vote in our poll on whether Goldman Sachs and UBS should get their outstanding payment for their work on the Mail sale. And here's a few questions which Vince Cable might like to ponder. We'll be back tomorrow, with more general coverage of events - having rather gone postal today. Cheers, and goodnight. GW. Some late news: Adrian Bailey, the chair of the BIS committee, has told the Guardian that the government would be \"mad\" to pay Goldman Sachs and UBS the outstanding \u00a34m fees they could receive for their work on Royal Mail. My colleague Sean Farrell has the story. The government would be \"mad\" to pay more than \u00a34m of deferred fees to the banks that advised on Royal Mail's privatisation because they undervalued the company, the chairman of a powerful parliamentary committee said after grilling the bankers on Wednesday. Adrian Bailey, who chairs the Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) Select Committee, said paying the fees, on top of more than \u00a312m already handed over, would reward highly paid bankers who set the float price too low at the expense of the taxpayer. Bailey gave his judgment after the committee had quizzed senior bankers from Goldman Sachs and UBS, the banks that led the flotation. In more than two hours of questioning they were accused of failing at their jobs and selling the taxpayer short. The government sold 60% of Royal Mail at 330p a share last month, valuing the company at \u00a33.3bn. But the shares leapt 38% on their first day of trading and closed tonight at 550p, giving Royal Mail a market value of \u00a35.5bn. Goldman, UBS and five other banks that marketed the shares have so far been paid \u00a312.7m between them but they could get another \u00a34.2m if Vince Cable, the secretary of state, thinks they warrant it. Bailey said: \"The government, in view of what has happened subsequently, would be mad to give them [the money]. \"It would be seen as rewarding the private sector that lost the tax payer potentially \u00a31bn and in these days of austerity I think it would be a very politically dangerous thing to do. These are professional people, who got it wrong, and they would be rewarded despite the fact they got it wrong.\" Here's the full story: Royal Mail float: paying bankers' deferred fees would be 'mad', MP says On the inquiry into the Co-op Bank scandal, my colleague Nils Pratley writes that the probe must be truly independent: Co-operative Bank scandal: bring on the inquiry, but it must be independent The saga is an embarrassment for the Co-operative movement, UK financial regulation and \u2013 perhaps \u2013 politicians of all main parties Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, has also said it must be chaired by an \"independent person...The authorities cannot be seen to be marking their own work.\" Does he have anyone specific in mind...... One of the best moments in today's hearing was when Tory MP Brian Binley accused the bankers of impersonating 'the cult of the high priest' by claiming they done a good deal (see 11.01am). I've now found the full quote, thanks to efinancial news: Here's how Binley let rip: All of you have come together like you\u2019re a professional body to defend one another.... As a taxpayer, can I say this is the cult of the high priest. It\u2019s meant to be exclusive, meant to keep other people out, meant to say you\u2019re much better at the job than you are, and you failed the taxpayer. The threat of a strike still hangs over Royal Mail, but it appears that some progress has been made at talks between management and union leaders today. The Communications Workers Union has announced that the two sides have agreed to another, final, seven day extension: There has been further progress in the negotiations between Royal Mail and CWU. Accordingly, both sides have agreed to an extension of the ballot deadline to allow for talks to continue. This is the final extension and is agreed for a further seven days. 'The CWU postal executive will meet on Monday the 25th November to consider the detailed position and determine whether industrial action should be announced. Here's the full statement. The boss of Lloyds Banking Group can celebrate becoming \u00a32.3m richer. The bank's shares have closed at a level at which the taxpayer will make a profit on its bailing out Lloyds, for the 30th day in a row. That's enough to trigger the bonus of three million shares for its CEO, Antonio Horta Osorio. As Jill wrote last weekend, the share bonus was Horta Osorio's idea. He can't cash in the shares until 2018 though. Lloyds share price, for the record, closed at 75.02p tonight. The break-even point was 73.6p. The Unite union has tweeted two graphics. One showing how Royal Mail's share value has risen steadily since the flotation.... ...and one showing how Goldman and UBS placed a lower valuation on Royal Mail than the banks who weren't hired to sell it: Worth remembering that several bankers told MPs today that you can't really compare the valuations at the pitching process to the price a company is actually sold. Which raised further questions about how the City works.... Trading on the London Stock market is over, and Royal Mail shares are unchanged on the day at 550p. A 66% increase on their flotation price in October. UBS's sell note, and their price target of 450p, seems to have been ignored by traders. Back to Royal Mail, and today's committee hearing piles more pressure on Vince Cable, according to shadow trade minister Ian Murray. Press Association has the quotes from Murray: There are real concerns that taxpayers have lost out to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds as a result of ministers' botched RoyalMail fire sale at a time when families are struggling with a cost-of-living crisis of David Cameron's making. Vince Cable has dismissed these concerns as 'froth' but this is looking less credible by the day and he has serious questions to answer. We now know he considered the option of a higher price and discussed this with banks but subsequently rejected this option. He needs to explain to the committee next week why this happened and whether political considerations played a role. Evidence this morning highlighted that major banks including Citibank and JPMorgan, alongside Panmure Gordon, valued Royal Mail significantly above the price at which it was sold. A lot of other stuff has been occurring while I was watching the BIS hearing or mopping up the reaction. Big developments over the Co-op Group, with prime minister David Cameron floating the prospect of an inquiry into its increasingly troubled banking arm. The issue has roared up the political agenda, with Cameron citing Labour's links to disgraced ex-chairman Paul Flowers at Prime Minister's Question's today. David Cameron: inquiry into Co-op Bank may be needed In the eurozone, the euro has fallen over half a percent against the US dollar following a report saying the European Central Bank is considering imposing negative interest rates on commercial banks to encourage them to lend. We've known for a while that this is an option, but Bloomberg suggests it's moving up the agenda: The euro's weakness has also pushed the pound over the \u20ac1.2 mark again. Sterling had been otherwise calm, after the latest Bank of England minutes suggested policymakers are in no rush to raise UK borrowing costs: Dovish' Bank of England minutes lessen chances of early interest rate rise Veteran City commentator David Buik predicts that Vince Cable will be thoroughly quizzed next week, having watched the BIS committee \"having the drains up\" (classic Buik) about Royal Mail today. Here's some highlights from his afternoon note: Pricing an IPO is never easy. You need to please the client/government, vendors, purchasers and shareholders and there are so many imponderables in pricing the value of a company \u2013 value of assets, distribution platform, political and economic considerations \u2013 home and abroad and the size of the IPO. Royal Mail is the largest IPO since 2006. The ability to place 600 million shares some with fund managers, some with the retail investor, 10% with the workforce with 30% remaining with the Government was no easy task. Some IPOs have fallen below this issue price. It was imperative that this did not happen to RMG. Richard Cormack of Goldman Sachs and James Robertson of UBS \u2013 both lead banks with Lazard Brothers - were given an extremely tough time by the chairman, Brian Binley and Mike Crockart aided and abetted by a more courteous and measured interrogation by Bill Bain, Robin Walker, Rebecca Harris and Katy Clark..... All the banks who were interrogated insisted that submitting an initial ranging valuation was totally different from a more exact IPO valuation. My colleague at Panmure, Gert Zonneveld gave an extremely good account of himself, refusing to get sucked in to any political nuances. He felt it was his responsibility to tell his clients that in his opinion this IPO offered extremely good value..... The committee was underwhelmed by some of the answers given. All investment banks present said a discount of between 10-15% was normal. The 38% premium on the first day\u2019s trading for RMG was unusual but 30 years ago BT traded at a 30% premium. I suspect there is little correlation between these two situations. Brian Binley suggested that Goldman and UBS had been incompetent in seriously undervaluing the company, thus stitching the taxpayer up. Cormack and Robertson were adamant that the Government accepted their advice. I suspect that next week Dr Cable and Michael Fallon can expect a real grilling. Buik also suggests a possible ulterior motive for the Royal Mail flotation not being priced higher -- the government has more asset sales on its agenda: This IPO had to be a huge success to accommodate TSB, Lloyds and eventually RBS in the future. Absolutely no chance of there being any admitted tacit connection, but where there\u2019s smoke there is sometimes fire! Another question for Cable.... It's not surprising that Goldman Sachs' Richard Cormack looked tight-lipped leaving Portcullis House after the hearing, after being told by Brian Binley MP that Goldman's intelligence-gathering system for pricing Royal Mail had let the taxpayer down. But in truth, the bankers weren't completely humiliated in the Grimond Room (Goldman and UBS got a saut\u00e9ing rather than a full-blast grilling). No one was forced to apologise, and the two banks couldn't be shifted from their view that they'd handled the IPO in a sensible way in the circumstances. Crucially, the three banks who placed higher valuations on the Royal Mail and were all ignored by the government didn't take the opportunity to put the leather brogues in. Panmure's Gert Zonneveld was more independent than the rest, deftly puncturing claims that the Royal Mail share surge was froth by saying markets generally price companies quite well. But there was no real dissent in the ranks. The session has certainly lined up Vince Cable for a robust inquisition next week. A few questions spring to mind for the Business Secretary to answer: 1) Why were UBS and Goldman Sachs hired to handle the IPO, rather than JP Morgan, Citigroup or Deutsche Bank who all put a higher initial value on Royal Mail? 2) Why didn't he raise the float price to 350p in the final days, after being advised that the IPO price could be pushed up by 20p without puncturing demand? 3) Should he have postponed the float until America's debt ceiling crisis had been resolved, rather than launching the Royal Mail into a nervous market? 4) What criteria will Cable use to decide whether or not to give Goldman and UBS the \u00a34m outstanding payment? Does he believe they did a good job, or does he share Brian Binley's fears that they were duped by City investors? 5) Does he regret criticising Gert Zonneveld's prediction in early October that Royal Mail was worth a billion pounds more than the IPO price? Does he still believe there is froth clinging to the share price? 6) Why wasn't more attention given to Royal Mail's property portfolio? The committee were startled to hear that those initial valuations from the likes of JP Morgan did not include potential future windfalls from selling surplus assets. During the session, The Times's correspondent Juliet Samuel tweeted a couple of highlights that I didn't manage to get into the blog: I flagged up early morning that UBS's research arm had issued a sell order on Royal Mail, claiming that the postal operator was over-priced. They're not the only people putting out research notes on the Mail -- my colleague Nick Fletcher had rounded up the details: Royal Mail shares dip as flotation advisor's analysts issue sell note Based on what you've heard today, do you reckon Goldman Sachs and UBS have done well enough to earn their discretionary \u00a34m payment from the taxpayer for handling the privatisation of Royal Mail? Vote here: Should Goldman Sachs and UBS get extra \u00a34m for Royal Mail sale? Reminder - Vince Cable must decide if the two banks have met the criteria for the payment, which apparently include working well with the government, and how the newly floated company performs. UBS agreed to sent the BIS committee the full seven points that must be met. Some more reaction to the session: And here's a photo of Goldman Sachs's Richard Cormack, co-head of equity capital markets, leaving Portcullis House after being told by MPs that his firm had failed the taxpayer over the sale of Royal Mail. Time to recap, for new readers: \u2022 The two banks who handled the privatisation of Royal Mail have faced heavy criticism from MPs today. Appearing before the Business, Innovation and Skills committee, Richard Cormack of Goldman Sachs and James Robertson, managing director of UBS, were accused of botching the flotation and costing the taxpayers many millions of pounds.  Brian Binley MP told Goldman that he \"wouldn't hire them again\" (see here) after hearing how it and UBS had run the IPO process, which saw Royal Mail shares sold at 330p each. Binley told the bankers he had begun to suspect their \"intelligence gathering operation\" was faulty, and suggested they had been duped by City investors who had suggested that they wouldn't value the postal service at more than \u00a33.3bn. \u2022 Goldman and UBS defended themselves, saying that the flotation was \"uniquely\" difficult. They tried to blame the threat of a US debt default, and the risk of strike action, for pushing down the final float price. Goldman's Cormack insisted that the process of 'book-building' (attracting bids from interested investors) had been performed competently. \"I feel we executed the transaction well\", he said. But Binley was unconvinced, saying that he's learned early in his career that \"anyone can sell cheap beer\", the trick is to get the price right. Binley urged Goldman to rethink the way it handles IPOs, saying that it \"came up with the wrong answer\" and fed that rogue information to the government. Under questioning, UBS's Robertson said that the industrial unrest had been the main risk in the run-up to the float. The bankers attempted to persuade the committee that today's share price, of 538p right now, cannot be compared to the price at which you could shift 600 million shares. \u2022 MPs also questioned whether the banks, which have already been paid over \u00a312m in fees, should receive an extra \u00a34m discretionary payment. It's up to the secretary of state, they replied. Over to you, Vince... \u2022 UBS also revealed that in the final days ahead of the float, they had told the government that the price could be raised by another 20p before driving away demand. That might have raised another \u00a3120m for the taxpayer. Robertson said, though, that such a move would have been rare and tricky. \u2022 Three investment banks who failed to be selected to handle the sale revealed that they had all valued the Royal Mail at more than the two banks who got the deal. JP Morgan has calculated that Royal Mail was worth up to \u00a38.5bn, while Citi had pitched a valuation of between \u00a35.9bn and \u00a36.5bn (partly because it predicted a rather higher dividend payment than proved to be the case). More details. \u2022 MPs were also astonished to hear that these valuations did not even include the potential gains from future property sales. Apparently such information simply wasn't included. UBS said that the IPO process suggested there was \u00a3100m of surplus property which could be sold. Katy Clark MP, for one, fears that much more will be raised, depriving taxpayers of future profits. \u2022 Gert Zonneveld, managing director at Panmure Gordon -- the first analyst to predict Royal Mail was badly undervalued -- also dismissed Vince Cable's claim that the share price jump was \"froth\". Today's share price reflects the Royal Mail's true value, he said. Press Association have the full quotes of the exchange between Tory MP Brian Binley and Goldman Sachs' Richard Cormack (as covered at 10.52am). Binley said: All the advice you gave turned out not to be helpful for the taxpayer. Right from the beginning, the Secretary of State was advised it would not go above 330p. Somebody somewhere has misled the taxpayer and cost the taxpayer. Why do you have confidence in your intelligence gathering mechanism to suggest to the Secretary of State that you were right, when you were wrong? Or did the Secretary of State decide for political reasons to keep the price at the lower level in order to have a successful sale?\" Mr Binley asked whether taxpayers would be entitled to believe that the banks \"were not very clever\" in their job, given how much they were paid. After an hour of exchanges between MPs and the bankers, Mr Binley said: I thought this might have been a political plan to keep the price down and ensure an effective, successful sale. The more I hear, I am beginning to suspect your intelligence gathering operation. Some more reaction to the session from twitter: As the six witnesses head back to the safety of the City, here's a snap of them in action: From left to right, we have John Mayne, Managing Director, UK Client Coverage at JP Morgan; Ben Storey, Head of UK Investment Banking and Broking at Citibank; James Robertson, managing director at UBS; Richard Cormack, managing director, Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets at Goldman Sachs; Gert Zonneveld, managing director, Co-Head of Research at Panmure Gordon, and James Agnew, chairman of UK Corporate Broking, Deutsche Bank The session finished with committee chair Adrian Bailey asking Goldman Sachs's Richard Cormack about a legal case brought against Goldman in America, over its handling of an IPO. Cormack (who is Goldman' managing director, and co-head of equity capital markets) says he doesn't know about this. You don't know about a 12-year old court case into how Goldman handled a flotation, queries Bailey, eyebrows heading towards the ceiling? Cormack does not. He also doesn't know if the government considered it. I'm quite astounded, says Bailey. And that was the end of the hearing. After some research, I'm pretty sure Bailey is referring to a case brought over the flotation of eToys Inc in 1999 in which Goldman played a lead role. At the time it was the fifth biggest IPO in history, but it quickly went sour. It was settled in September this year. Reuters has the details: Goldman Sachs finally ends litigation over 1999 eToys IPO Litigation over Goldman Sachs Group's role in the spectacular rise and fall of eToys Inc finally ended on Thursday with court approval of a $7.5 million settlement. The online toy seller's IPO in 1999 became a poster child for the excesses of the dot-com bubble. The stock quadrupled when it began trading, but two years later the company was in bankruptcy. The case was brought by creditors of eToys, who alleged that Goldman Sachs underpriced the stock to ensure a huge pop in price on the first day of trading. Katy Clark MP explains to UBS and Goldman that many MPs up and down the country are worried that valuable Royal Mail property will be sold off in the coming years. She says: What a lot of us are fearing is that assets will be sold off in our constituency, at a profit, and we won't get the benefits. Katy Clark, Labour MP for North Ayrshire and Arran, also homes in on the issue of Royal Mail's excess property. She reminds the bankers that it has 2,000 properties up and down the country. A crucial part of valuing the firm must include the prospect that some will be sold as the UK postal service develops in future. UBS's Robertson argues that the real value of Royal Mail lies in its people, and its service, not mere bricks and mortar. He also explains that Royal Mail has sold off \u00a3500m of surplus property assets in the run-up to the flotation. The IPO documents suggested there was another \u00a3100m of property still to be sold, so the value is priced in. Onto the other big question -- Royal Mail's estate of properties. What value did the investment bankers put on its excess property? Remarkably, JP Morgan, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank all say that they didn't include the prospect of property sales in their initial valuations. Which, remember, were all higher than the \u00a33.3bn which it was sold for (JP Morgan suggested up to \u00a38.5bn). Why on earth not, demands committee chair Adrian Bailey. Apparently, it's because there was no information about surplus property in the information they were sent when they were asked to pitch. UBS says it included a value of \u00a3200m (it, of course, was given more information once it was selected to handle the float). Adrian Bailey looks quite aghast that something as important as Royal Mail's property portfolio might be simply ignored by investment bankers when they try to work out how much it's worth. The committee already looked seriously unimpressed with the way the IPO was handled - and this must have added to these concerns. Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, tweets: Should we be concerned that foreign sovereign wealth funds were allocated shares in the float? UBS plays down this concern, saying the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, for example, are serious investors -- not at odds with Vince Cable's goal of getting long-term blue-chip types on board. What do these leading lights of the City think the government should do with its remaining shares in Royal Mail - sell or keep? No-one really sticks their neck out -- the government should wait until its six-month lock-in is over, and then take advice, says JP Morgan's John Mayne, who is managing director for UK Client Coverage, Ben Storey, head of UK Investment Banking &amp; Broking at Citibank, says that if conditions when the lock-up finishes are the same as today then \"it may well be a good time to sell\" Gert Zonneveld, the co-head of research at Panmure Gordon, says the government should sell up if it doesn't want to be a long-term investor -- unless it thinks that there is future upside. Q: who made the final decision on the 330p price that Royal Mail was sold at? Goldman: the Secretary of State and the government made the final decision. Was it consistent with advise from UBS and Goldman? Yes, adds Cormack. Great question - about the discretionary payment of \u00a34.2m that Goldman and UBS could receive. Do you think taxpayers will welcome you receiving it with open arms? UBS's Robertson demures: I think that's for the secretary of state to decide - it's in his gift. UBS's James Robertson adds that the bankers discussed the possibility of raising the price with Lazard, which was acting for the government, in the final days before the float. \"We don't take raising money for the taxpayer lightly -- we discussed this with Lazard, and they discussed with the Secretary of State\", he added. A question about why UBS and Goldman recommended not raising the IPO price as the float date approached. UBS's Robertson says that they advised the government in the 'final days' is that they could have raised an extra 20p before demand fell off sharply. He explains: We gave it serious consideration as obviously 20p is a lot of money. (there's a phrase you don't expect to hear from a banker) So why didn't they do it? Well, it's pretty rare, says Robertson. -- extending the price has only been done once in the last 13 years, they'd have had to offer withdrawal rights to 650,000 retail investors (possible, but tricky). And the US default and the balletballot on strike action were both looming -- they could have wiped out the positive momentum. They didn't, though.... Committee chair Adrian Bailey wants to see the report that Goldman prepared on the float and gave to Vince Cable. It was a confidential report....We'll have to talk about it with our client, Cormack explains. UBS's Robertson repeats that \"this was a uniquely risky and difficult IPO\". It's hard to float a company that doesn't have a track record of profitability, for example. Update: he's also making the point that it was a tricky time to float Royal Mail shares, given industrial action at home, and the US debt ceiling crisis abroad. Brian Binley again. He asks Goldman's Cormack whether he thinks the bankers' \"intelligence-gathering\" activities were exploited by the potential investors who said how much they'd be prepared to pay for Royal Mail. Cormack starts to run through the process again, but is interrupted quickly by Binley, who says: I was in the business of selling beer, years ago. Anyone can sell cheap beer. What i'm suggesting is that you got this wrong, and you should look at your product to that next time you sell a better product to a satisfied customer, Binley adds. Cormack give no indication that Goldman will change its ways: We were seeking a broad-base of long-term investors who would provide broad-based support to the government and give access to the capital markets, he adds. The people who have been buying shares subsequently might not have paid as much in the IPO process. The process we we used was the right one, he insists.\u2026 Oh dear, I'm not convinced, says Binley, dropping his pen on the table in disgust. Why didn't UBS and Goldman Sachs spot all the positive newspaper commentary, saying Royal Mail looked undervalued? GS's Cormack replies that the media initially had a balanced view of the IPO, and only turned much more positive in the final days. Did you discount the interest from short-term investors, and what impact did that have? Goldman Sachs' Cormack says that the book-builders did focus on the interests of the long-term shareholders (which Vince Cable wanted to attract), but he don't think this materially affect the value of Royal Mail. What will the Royal Mail share price be in six months time? None of the five investment bankers wants to give a price -- JP Morgan, Citi and Deutsche Bank say they've not been closely involved with the company for six months, having not been chosen to handle the float. UBS's Robertson says there's various factors to consider, including industrial relations and the possibility of VAT being added to postal products. But Panmure's Zonneveld isn't so bashful -- he's got a target price of 570p. And he stands by comments made to the Guardian on October 25th that Royal Mail has good prospects. Is Vince Cable right that the Royal Mail's soaring share price is merely 'froth'\"? Most of the bankers say that such early spikes are common. UBS's managing director James Robertson says its \"not unusual\" to see this kind of thing. But Gert Zonneveld, Managing Director at Panmure Gordon, sinks the very notion of froth. This is not froth....the shares have been trading for six weeks. Markets are quite efficient, he says, adding Today's value is the price that the markets place on it. Brian Binley is back-- accusing the bankers of all defending each other. He suggests that these senior City players are painting a picture of \"The cult of the high priest\" surrounding the IPO process. Isn't the truth that you simply undervalued Royal Mail, and cost the taxpayer money? Goldman's Cormack doesn't accept this. I feel that we executed the transaction well for the interests of the taxpayer \"Well, I wouldn't hire you again,\" Binley replies. MPs ask the banks who missed out on handling the float how much the government could sell its remaining shares for. How much of a discount would be needed? None will give a clear answer. But Ben Storey, head of UK Investment Banking &amp; Broking at Citibank, says that October's float took place in a \"clearly challenging\" environment. Market sentiment has improved since, he adds. JP Morgan's John Mayne agrees that some discount would be needed. Tory MP Brian Binley gives Goldman and UBS a serious dressing down. He says that his initial concern was that the government wanted to get a low price to ensure success. \"But, now I'm starting to doubt your intelligence-gathering abilities.\" Your advice and the process you ran has damaged the taxpayer, Binley adds. Goldman Sachs's Richard Cormack defends the banks, saying they had run a \"market-led book building process\" which had, in his view, successfully delivered a good price. Binley is unimpressed, saying \"Someone somewhere has misled the taxpayer and cost the taxpayer.\" Were you wrong, or did the Secretary of State keep the price low to ensure a successful sale? Cormack replies that: based on all our research, 330p was the price we could achieve for the amount of shares we were selling,says Cormack. For all the money you were paid, you aren't very good at your job, shoots back Binley. Cormack denies it -- saying: This was a large, complicated deal against a difficult backdrop in the markets with the debt ceiling, and the threat of industrial action.... In the context it was a well-execute transaction. Was the US debt ceiling deadlock another factor, as Vince Cable has suggested? Goldman's Cormack says it was -- the London stock market fell for 12 days in a row as investors feared a catastrophic default. It was certainly a factor stopping us raising the IPO price, he adds. But you're a bright man, surely you knew that US politicians would resolve the dilemma. There's always a danger that a deal wouldn't be reached, Cormack adds. UBS's Robertson adds that from September onwards the threat of a Royal Mail strike over pay was the main \"risk factor\" hanging over the IPO. We've moved onto a key issue -- whether the threat of industrial action pushed down Royal Mail's float price. UBS's James Robertson says that the \"appetite\" for Royal Mail shares had been coloured by the prospect of a strike. So how much did you change your value by? The strike threat affected the view fo what they theyt were prepare to pay andit set the range of 260 to 330 By how much? It's hard to say. Did you feed this back to Vince Cable? Yes, says Goldman's Cormack. The bankers are asked about Vince Cable's claim in a letter that some large investors had threatened to walk away if the price rose above 330p. Goldman's Cormack confirms these comments. He doesn't know whether those same firms have since bought shares in the stock market (at above 330p, of course) -- but we'll find out eventually when the Royal Mail investor list is updated. Goldman's Cormack says that it was important to sell a majority of Royal Mail shares, and also to retain a large majority for the taxpayer so they can benefit it the share price is higher in the long term. The committee aren't sounding impressed by the process by which the Royal Mail was valued and processed. It sounds like banks are incentivised to pitch the value too low and then drag it up. Goldman's Cormack paints a more positive picture - saying that GS and UBS used the book building process to 'walk people up' from their original lower bids towards the 330p final price. Goldman's Cormack says it takes time for a share price to settle after flotation. UBS's Richardson says there have been eight other IPOs this year in London --- four are trading at least 60% higher than the float, 2 are 25% higher, and 2 are down at least 20%. Goldman Sach's initial pitch for Royal Mail valued it at between \u00a33bn and \u00a33.7bn, later settling on \u00a33.25bn to \u00a33.5bn with a maximum of \u00a33.75bn. UBS's James Robertson says that the Royal Mail should be pleased that much of the shares in the float were sold to \"long-term blue chip\" investors. He's reminded that a hedge fund, the Children's Investment Fund, has been steadily building a stake in the Royal Mail. Has that pushed the share price up? Robertson says it has. Gert Zonneveld of Panmure Gordon is reminded that Vince Cable dismissed his valuation as an \"outlier\" when he suggested that Royal Mail might be worth up to \u00a34,5bn in the weeks leading to the float. Is he unhappy about that? Zonneveld plays it cool - saying he's pleased that his research has been vindicated. I\"m not concerned about the Secretary of State's comments, he suggests. Chairman Adrian Bailey calls him up on this, saying that sounds like Zonneveld is \"deeply concerned\". When Vince Cable said he didn't want to rubbish you, well \"in political terms it means that he does want to rubbish you\", Bailey says. Zonneveld responds: He's a politician, playing politics is what he does. I was the only guy in the market with a view apart from the syndicate banks, he added. Do you accept that you undervalued the company? Goldman's Cormack argues not. He says that you can't expect to sell \u00a32bn of shares, 600m in total, at the same price that just 1.6 million are changing hands today. MPs are keen to find why UBS and Goldman Sachs reckoned Royal Mail was worth less than three other banks - JP Morgan, Citi and Deutsche. James Robertson of UBS says that Royal Mail had no track record of profitability, and faced various risks. Goldman's Richard Cormack says that the valuation at IPO should be divorced from the value at the time of the pitching process. We are all doing outside-in valuation, he says. Panmure's initial valuation was between \u00a34bn and \u00a35bn, but it later settled on a valuation of \u00a33.7bn to \u00a34.5bn, says Gert Zonneveld. Why were the valuations so different? From \u00a33.1bn to over \u00a38bn? Citi's Ben Storey explains that it's actually quite hard to value a company from outside, as you have to make many assumptions. These were preliminary valuations, which can't really be compared to the final floatation value. He says that Citi had a higher expectation for Royal Mail's dividend payment than proved correct. UBS's James Robertson says that it initially valued Royal Mail at \u00a33.1bn, rising to \u00a34.6bn if various risks were resolved. He explains that UBS asked for a base fee of 0.9% of the money raised, plus a 0.3% incentive fee. What is the criteria for getting the bonus fee? Various factors, including the 'after market' performance, and working well with the seller. Is there an incentive for winning banks to pitch a low valuation, and then look successful by getting a higher price? Goldman's Cormack denies it -- the incentive is to get a fair valuation. MPs are getting details from the banks who weren't selected to hold the flotation. And they're pretty interesting. JP Morgan's John Mayne says that it valued Royal Mail at between \u00a36.8bn and \u00a38.5bn Citigroup's Ben Storey says it said valued Royal Mail at between \u00a35.9bn and \u00a36.5bn. Deutsche Bank's James Agnew says it offered a valuation of \u00a35.5bn and \u00a36bn. A reminder -- Royal Mail was sold at a valuation of \u00a33.3bn - and is currently worth around \u00a35.4bn. And what fees did they ask for? It's a complicated answer, as the fees are dependent on the price of the sale. But Citi's valuation would have delivered total fees for all the bankers involved of \u00a314m, and Deutsche's would be \u00a316m. So what was the rational for getting selected? Goldman's Cormack says that it was wide-ranging, including how a bank would pitch the sale to investors, what they valued it at, and how they'd like to be paid. Confirmation that the two banks who got the deal, Goldman and UBS, have received \u00a313m of fees so far. Richard Cormack of Goldman Sachs takes the first question. He explains that the government approached the main investment banks and asked then to pitch. What was the criteria, asks Bailey? An understanding of the company, a track record of handling such sales, and their general competence, Cormack explains. Was there any reason why the government's couldn't hold a Dutch auction? Cormack argues that the approach used was in line with the government's policies, and general City practice. We're underway, with Adrian Bailey asking the six bankers present to explain how the process of becoming an adviser to the float worked.... The BIS committee hearing should start shortly, in the Grimond Room at Portcullis House. It's being streamed live here. On the issue of withholding fees from Goldman Sachs and UBS... they have already received around \u00a312.7m for their work on the Royal Mail float, but there's another \u00a34.2m waiting to be paid at the discretion of the government. Adrian Bailey, the chair of the BIS committee, has already said MPs will examine whether Goldman and UBS will get the outstanding payment. As my colleague Sean Farrell reported on Sunday, Bailey has said: Questions need to be asked about the criteria used to qualify for the deferred payment. Katy Clark, a Labour member of the committee, is keen to find out exactly what the investment banks told the government before it decided the pricing of Royal Mail. Clark said: We want to hear what officials were told. What was the basis on which the advice was provided \u2013 and if the asset was worth a huge amount more, was that information given to the secretary of state [Vince Cable] and why wasn't it proceeded on? Cable will appear before the committee next week.... A prediction: MPs will hear that pricing stock market flotations is a devilishly tricky art. Bankers could also cite some high-profile recent IPOs that bombed -- such as Facebook, whose shares sunk when it floated last year (they've rallied hard since, though). As Bloomberg's Caroline Hyde put it: It's a very difficult art to price these floats. In the City, traders often talk about how newly listed companies should 'pop' on their first day's trading. But the problem with using this argument for Royal Mail is that the share have soared by 60% since the float. More a boom than a pop. The Communications Workers Union is calling for the government to withhold outstanding payments to the bankers who advised it on the Royal Mail float. The CWU's general secretary, Billy Hayes, said: Hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money have been lost because of the failure of the government and its advisers to accurately value the company. In other situations this would be gross incompetence or even theft. Private shareholders have lined their pockets at the expense of the taxpayer following the huge leap in the share price. At the very least the institutions which advised the government should not receive any further payments, which are discretionary. Serious consideration should be given to claiming back fees paid for shoddy advice which has left the client \u2013 the taxpayer \u2013 out of pocket. I suspect that it won't be possible to claim back those fees already paid - but MPs will raise the issue this morning.... Here's the full story: Royal Mail sale valuation branded a debacle by union Shares in Royal Mail are down 2% this morning, ahead of the BIS committee hearing. They've dropped 11p in early trading to 530p, valuing the company at \u00a35.39bn. That's still 60% higher than the flotation price (in mid-October). This may be triggered by a research note from UBS analysts, who have slapped a 'sell' rating on Royal Mail shares and set a target price of 450p. Something for UBS's managing director, James Robertson, to ponder ahead of his appearance before MPs in an hour's time. Two other analyst houses also published research notes on Royal Mail this morning. Barclays set a target price of 466p, while RBC is more optimistic - it reckons Royal Mail shares are worth 580p. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. It's rare to see investment bankers called to account for their actions. But today, the top people who advised the government the controversial flotation of Royal Mail face a grilling by MPs. The Business, Investment and Skills committee will demand answers from Goldman Sachs and UBS, who ran the float, on how the postal service was sold off at \u00a33.3bn. It immediately saw its shares soar 38% when trading began last month, and is now valued at over \u00a35bn. The line-up includes JP Morgan -- who apparently told the government during the pricing process that Royal Mail could be worth \u00a310bn -- and Panmure Gordon, the broker who warned that the sale was undervalued. Citi and Deutsche Bank, who also missed out on running the IPO, make up the sextet. The hearing starts at 9.30am. Here's who's attending: John Mayne, Managing Director, UK Client Coverage, JP Morgan Ben Storey, Head of UK Investment Banking &amp; Broking, Citibank Gert Zonneveld, Managing Director, Co-Head of Research, Panmure Gordon James Agnew, Chairman of UK Corporate Broking, Deutsche Bank James Robertson, Managing Director, UBS Richard Cormack, Managing Director, Co-Head of Equity Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs Royal Mail's not the only story in town, though. The Co-op Group remains in the news for the wrong reasons, as the scandal around former Bank chairman Paul Flowers swirls. Police search home of former Co-op Bank boss. We'll also be looking at central banks, with the publication of the latest Bank of England minutes at 9.30am GMT (just as the Royal Mail hearing starts...). They'll give an insight into how the Monetary Policy Committee sees the UK economy (the BoE was pretty upbeat at last week's quarterly inflation report). The US Federal Reserve is also releasing its latest minutes tonight, but the markets have already got a large dollop of wisdom from its outgoing chair, Ben Bernanke, to digest. Overnight, he declared that the Fed was committed to ultra-loose monetary policy for as long as needed -- suggesting no early tightening of its huge stimulus programme. Despite this promise of yet more easy money, Europe's stock markets are expected to slide this morning. Trading has begun, with the FTSE 100 is down 0.4%, or 21 points, at 6670. And we'll also be watching Greece, where talks between the government and its troika of lenders appear to be gummed down. I'll be tracking all the action through the day....",

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail float: paying bankers' deferred fees would be 'mad', MP says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government would be \"mad\" to pay more than \u00a34m in deferred fees to the banks that advised on Royal Mail's privatisation because they undervalued the company, the chairman of a parliamentary committee said after grilling the bankers on Wednesday. Adrian Bailey, who chairs the Business, Innovation and Skills (Bis) select committee, said paying the fees, on top of more than \u00a312m already handed over, would reward highly paid bankers who set the float price too low at the expense of the taxpayer. Bailey gave his judgment after the committee questioned senior staff from Goldman Sachs and UBS, the banks that led the flotation. In more than two hours of questioning, they were accused of failing at their jobs and selling the taxpayer short. The government sold 60% of Royal Mail at 330p a share last month, valuing the company at \u00a33.3bn. But the shares leapt 38% on their first day of trading and closed on Wednesday at 550p, giving Royal Mail a market value of \u00a35.5bn. Goldman, UBS and five other banks that marketed the shares have so far been paid \u00a312.7m between them but they could get a further \u00a34.2m if Vince Cable, the secretary of state, thinks they warrant it. Bailey said: \"The government, in view of what has happened subsequently, would be mad to give them [the money]. \"It would be seen as rewarding the private sector that lost the taxpayer potentially \u00a31bn and, in these days of austerity, I think it would be a very politically dangerous thing to do. These are professional people, who got it wrong, and they would be rewarded despite the fact they got it wrong.\" The banks in the syndicate that marketed Royal Mail to investors shared fees of 0.8% of the money raised, with Goldman and UBS splitting an extra 0.1% for leading the operation. The government's independent adviser, Lazard, has been paid \u00a31.5m with no fees deferred. Asked whether taxpayers would be willing to accept the banks getting the extra fees, UBS's James Robertson said: \"I think that is for the secretary of state to decide. It is in his gift.\" MPs questioned James Robertson and Richard Cormack of Goldman Sachs alongside bankers from Citi, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank, which missed out on advising on the float. Gert Zonneveld of Panmure Gordon, who argued that Royal Mail was undervalued before the shares started trading, also appeared. Goldman's initial pitch, made without inside information, valued Royal Mail at up to \u00a33.75bn and UBS's top estimate was \u00a34.6bn. The others were more than \u00a31bn higher with JP Morgan's the highest at \u00a38.5bn. The banks' job was to sound out fund managers on how much they were prepared to pay for the shares and to generate demand in a so-called book-building process. As interest increased, they moved the price to the top of their initial 260p-330p range. The UBS and Goldman bankers defended the sale price, saying a potential US debt default and the threat of a nationwide postal strike loomed over the flotation. Robertson admitted the government could have got a further 20p per share if it had gone above the agreed range but he said the risks were too great because it would have caused a delay and pushed long-term investors to their limit. \"Momentum can evaporate and go away very quickly \u2026 when we were looking at all the risks, on balance we chose to stick to 330p. We discussed it with the Shareholder Executive [which advises on privatisations] and Lazard and they discussed it with the secretary of state.\" But committee members accused the banks of failing at their job and of being duped by potential investors, who always want to pay as little as possible. Brian Binley, a Conservative member of the committee, told the bankers: \"Somebody somewhere has failed the taxpayer and cost the taxpayer in this initial instance. I just wonder whether the taxpayer has the right to wonder whether for all the money you were paid you weren't very good at your job.\" The committee's attention will now turn to Cable and his minister Michael Fallon, who will appear next Wednesday with representatives from Lazard and the Shareholder Executive. In his last appearance at the committee just before the flotation, Cable dismissed the prospect of a jump in Royal Mail's share price as \"froth\". Bailey said the session with the bankers was preparation for asking Cable why he priced the privatisation so low. \"I think there was a recognition [by the committee] that the price has been undervalued. Did they rate their political position as being more important than the interests of the taxpayer because if it was overpriced they would have had egg on their faces?\" A spokesman for the Bis department declined to comment. What they said \"I'm hearing an awful lot of sales speak and an awful lot of stuff from you all about how wonderful you are, what superb backup and what great expertise you have. You have all come together like a professional body to defend each other. Can I, as a taxpayer, assume that all this is the cult of the high priest and [is] meant to be exclusive and keep others out and meant to say you are much better at your job than you are, and you have failed the tax payer?\" Brian Binley, Conservative committee member \"We advised the government we could get an extra 20p above the 330p before demand from long-term investors would have fallen off very sharply. We considered that very carefully because obviously 20p is a lot of money \u2026 This was a uniquely difficult and risky IPO and there will be lessons learnt from how to execute these in the future.\" James Robertson, UBS \"The average [trading] volume at the moment on a daily basis of these shares is about 1.3 million shares versus the 600m shares that we placed at the time of the IPO. I don't think that today's price is indicative of where we could have placed 600m shares.\" Richard Cormack, Goldman Sachs \"I do not think it [the current Royal Mail share price] is froth. These shares have been trading on the market for nearly six weeks, several hundred million shares have traded hands. Today's value of the company is the value that the market attributes to it.\" Gert Zonneveld, Panmure Gordon \"The question we want to pursue further is, what advice was given to the government, and in effect how much influence the government brought upon Goldman Sachs and UBS to determine the price level, and how much was genuinely feedback from the market? Or were Goldman and UBS misled [by investors]?\" Adrian Bailey, committee chairman",

      "body": "<p>The government would be \"mad\" to pay more than \u00a34m in deferred fees to the banks that advised on Royal Mail's privatisation because they undervalued the company, the chairman of a parliamentary committee said after grilling the bankers on Wednesday.</p> <p>Adrian Bailey, who chairs the Business, Innovation and Skills (Bis) select committee, said paying the fees, on top of more than \u00a312m already handed over, would reward highly paid bankers who set the float price too low at the expense of the taxpayer.</p> <p>Bailey gave his judgment after the committee questioned senior staff from Goldman Sachs and UBS, the banks that led the flotation. In more than two hours of questioning, they were accused of failing at their jobs and selling the taxpayer short.</p> <p>The government sold 60% of Royal Mail at 330p a share last month, valuing the company at \u00a33.3bn. But the shares leapt 38% on their first day of trading and closed on Wednesday at 550p, giving Royal Mail a market value of \u00a35.5bn.</p> <p>Goldman, UBS and five other banks that marketed the shares have so far been paid \u00a312.7m between them but they could get a further \u00a34.2m if Vince Cable, the secretary of state, thinks they warrant it.</p> <p>Bailey said: \"The government, in view of what has happened subsequently, would be mad to give them [the money].</p> <p>\"It would be seen as rewarding the private sector that lost the taxpayer potentially \u00a31bn and, in these days of austerity, I think it would be a very politically dangerous thing to do. These are professional people, who got it wrong, and they would be rewarded despite the fact they got it wrong.\"</p> <p>The banks in the syndicate that marketed Royal Mail to investors shared fees of 0.8% of the money raised, with Goldman and UBS splitting an extra 0.1% for leading the operation. The government's independent adviser, Lazard, has been paid \u00a31.5m with no fees deferred.</p> <p>Asked whether taxpayers would be willing to accept the banks getting the extra fees, UBS's James Robertson said: \"I think that is for the secretary of state to decide. It is in his gift.\"</p> <p>MPs questioned James Robertson and Richard Cormack of Goldman Sachs alongside bankers from Citi, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank, which missed out on advising on the float. Gert Zonneveld of Panmure Gordon, who argued that Royal Mail was undervalued before the shares started trading, also appeared.</p> <p>Goldman's initial pitch, made without inside information, valued Royal Mail at up to \u00a33.75bn and UBS's top estimate was \u00a34.6bn. The others were more than \u00a31bn higher with JP Morgan's the highest at \u00a38.5bn.</p> <p>The banks' job was to sound out fund managers on how much they were prepared to pay for the shares and to generate demand in a so-called book-building process. As interest increased, they moved the price to the top of their initial 260p-330p range.</p> <p>The UBS and Goldman bankers defended the sale price, saying a potential US debt default and the threat of a nationwide postal strike loomed over the flotation.</p> <p>Robertson admitted the government could have got a further 20p per share if it had gone above the agreed range but he said the risks were too great because it would have caused a delay and pushed long-term investors to their limit. \"Momentum can evaporate and go away very quickly \u2026 when we were looking at all the risks, on balance we chose to stick to 330p. We discussed it with the Shareholder Executive [which advises on privatisations] and Lazard and they discussed it with the secretary of state.\"</p> <p>But committee members accused the banks of failing at their job and of being duped by potential investors, who always want to pay as little as possible.</p> <p>Brian Binley, a Conservative member of the committee, told the bankers: \"Somebody somewhere has failed the taxpayer and cost the taxpayer in this initial instance. I just wonder whether the taxpayer has the right to wonder whether for all the money you were paid you weren't very good at your job.\"</p> <p>The committee's attention will now turn to Cable and his minister Michael Fallon, who will appear next Wednesday with representatives from Lazard and the Shareholder Executive. In his last appearance at the committee just before the flotation, Cable dismissed the prospect of a jump in Royal Mail's share price as \"froth\".</p> <p>Bailey said the session with the bankers was preparation for asking Cable why he priced the privatisation so low.</p> <p>\"I think there was a recognition [by the committee] that the price has been undervalued. Did they rate their political position as being more important than the interests of the taxpayer because if it was overpriced they would have had egg on their faces?\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Bis department declined to comment.</p> <h2>What they said<br></h2> <p>\"I'm hearing an awful lot of sales speak and an awful lot of stuff from you all about how wonderful you are, what superb backup and what great expertise you have. You have all come together like a professional body to defend each other. Can I, as a taxpayer, assume that all this is the cult of the high priest and [is] meant to be exclusive and keep others out and meant to say you are much better at your job than you are, and you have failed the tax payer?\" <strong>Brian Binley, Conservative committee member</strong></p> <p>\"We advised the government we could get an extra 20p above the 330p before demand from long-term investors would have fallen off very sharply. We considered that very carefully because obviously 20p is a lot of money \u2026 This was a uniquely difficult and risky IPO and there will be lessons learnt from how to execute these in the future.\" <strong>James Robertson, UBS</strong></p> <p>\"The average [trading] volume at the moment on a daily basis of these shares is about 1.3 million shares versus the 600m shares that we placed at the time of the IPO. I don't think that today's price is indicative of where we could have placed 600m shares.\" <strong>Richard Cormack, Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p>\"I do not think it [the current Royal Mail share price] is froth. These shares have been trading on the market for nearly six weeks, several hundred million shares have traded hands. Today's value of the company is the value that the market attributes to it.\" <strong>Gert Zonneveld, Panmure Gordon</strong></p> <p>\"The question we want to pursue further is, what advice was given to the government, and in effect how much influence the government brought upon Goldman Sachs and UBS to determine the price level, and how much was genuinely feedback from the market? Or were Goldman and UBS misled [by investors]?\" <strong>Adrian Bailey, committee chairman</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The government is to launch two independent inquiries into the demise of the Co-operative Bank and the embarrassing revelations about its former chairman, Paul Flowers. The prime minister described Flowers as the \"man who has broken a bank\" following questions about his financial competence, drug-taking and resignation as a Bradford councillor over adult material on his computer. There will be an inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority into the behaviour of key individuals, as well as a separate more general inquiry ordered by the chancellor, George Osborne, which will be conducted by the Prudential Regulation Authority. These inquiries are separate to a police inquiry, the investigation under way by the Treasury select committee and an internal inquiry already ordered by the Co-op Group headed by Sir Christopher Kelly, the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life. The decision to launch the two official inquiries is likely to be announced next week, and the precise format, including whether evidence will be taken in public, has yet to be decided. Downing Street is confident that David Cameron's decision to refer to the possible inquiries will not destabilise the already perilous position of the Co-op Bank, since the two American Hedge Funds effectively running the bank are committed to putting \u00a3125m into it. To an extent the inquiry into how the Co-op Bank came to find itself in such a mess will also be another inquiry into a discredited supervisory system headed by the now defunct Financial Services Authority (FSA). It is also likely to look into whether the FSA should have realised that the Co-op Bank takeover of the Britannia in 2009 was never advisable. It may also look to see if there was any political encouragement for this takeover by the Treasury under the control of Alistair Darling or by the then prime minister, Gordon Brown. David Anderson, the former chief executive of the Co-operative Bank at the time of the merger with its rival Britannia building society, told the Treasury select committee this week that there had been no political involvement. Anderson, who stepped down in July 2009, told MPs that Britannia's bad real-estate loans \"did not bring down the bank\". In a boisterous session of prime minister's questions on Wednesday, Cameron raised questions over Flowers's suitability to run the bank. He claimed Labour must have known about the bank chairman's past when his appointment was approved by regulators under the last government. Police have searched the home of Flowers, a Methodist minister who led the bank for three years, after he was filmed allegedly buying and using hard drugs including crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine.

      "bodyText": "There were mounting concerns on Wednesday that RWE npower, one of the big six energy providers, will unveil further disinvestments in Britain following the sale for \u00a3218m of a supply business with half a million customers. RWE disposed of its \u00a3350m stake in the Horizon nuclear power venture in the UK last year and is searching for a buyer for its DEA oil exploration arm, operator of 13 producing gas fields in the North Sea. The power group needs to raise and save cash due to a decision by the German government to boost renewable power and phase out nuclear plants, but it is also reacting to growing political risk in Britain. The Essen-based company declined to comment on further cutbacks but an industry expert with close links to RWE npower said the utility would make further cuts in the face of \"huge uncertainty in Germany and Britain\" that made raising money very difficult for energy projects. The expert, who asked not to be named, said the combination of coalition government dithering over the Energy Market Reform bill compounded by Ed Miliband's retail price freeze had unnerved RWE at a time when it wanted to cut 6,750 jobs worldwide by 2016 and was struggling with \u00a330bn worth of debt. Npower, which has just raised its gas and electricity prices by 10.4% and come under fire for poor service plus low tax payments, on Wednesday agreed to sell two gas and electricity subsidiaries to Telecom Plus, a smaller supplier of energy and telephone services that trades as Utility Warehouse. Npower \u2013 named this week as the energy firm with the highest number of consumer complaints and currently beset by central computer failures \u2013 promised that customers would see no negative change in their service or contracts. Last month npower was among the energy companies hauled before the energy select committee, to face MPs' accusations that they offered a confusing array of tariffs that allowed them to make \"unfair profits\". The showdown reflected growing concern that the energy market is not working properly, in the wake of Labour leader Miliband's call for a price freeze. Paul Massara, the chief executive of npower, said the sale would be good for competition. \"In one move we have helped to create the biggest independent competitor in Britain's household energy supply market.

It has taken lurid details of the private life of the bank's former chairman to prompt George Osborne to start talks about an independent investigation into how a supposedly staid and responsible co-operative ended up with a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. The prospect of embarrassing the Labour front bench undoubtedly played a part in the timing of the prime minister's announcement.

The near-collapse of the Co-op Bank \u2013 which should have been thriving on its mutuality in the wake of the banking crisis \u2013 needs to be investigated to establish whether it was mistakes made by its management and regulators that left it with such a sudden gaping hole its finances. The inquiry is expected to go back to 2009, which will enable it to investigate the Co-op Bank's merger with Britannia Building Society at the height of the financial crisis \u2013 a move which has since proved disastrous. It should also look in detail at how the Co-op's talks to take over 631 branches from bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group ended in tatters \u2013 and with a \u00a3300m bill to cover the costs of its own IT systems, which had been left to rot on the assumption that the Lloyds deal would bring more sophisticated systems along with it. The negotiations for that deal took place on the coalition's watch, with Osborne, Cable et al hopeful that an enlarged Co-op Bank could become a serious new competitor on the high street.

He claimed Labour must have known about the bank chairman's past when his appointment was approved by regulators under the last government.</p> <p>\"The chancellor will be discussing with the regulators what is the appropriate form of inquiry to get to the bottom of what went wrong here,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But there are clearly a lot of questions that have to be answered. Why was Rev Flowers judged suitable to be chairman of a bank? Why weren't alarm bells ringing earlier, particularly by those who knew?</p> <p>\"I think it will be important in the coming days that if anyone does have information they stand up and provide it to the authorities.\"</p> <p>Cameron's comments raise the prospect of the government using its new powers, introduced in 2012 in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis, to force a regulator to conduct an inquiry.</p> <p>It would be expected to pre-date 2012 and might even cover the period back to 2009 when the Co-op merged with the Britannia Building Society.</p> <p>Three potential options are up for consideration \u2013 a criminal inquiry, which West Yorkshire police have already indicated they are considering, inquiries by the two City regulators \u2013 the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 which the coalition created last year, and an independent-style inquiry which would in all likelihood only take place once the other inquiries had run their course.</p> <p>None of the investigations into the near collapse of banks during the 2008 crisis have been independent. The City regulator at the time, the Financial Services Authority, launched its own review into what went wrong at Royal Bank of Scotland, while publication of a review into why HBOS collapsed has yet to be published more than five years after the bank was rescued by Lloyds Banking Group.</p> <p>The coalition could task the new regulatory bodies to conduct an inquiry into the collapse of the Co-op and appoint an individual to oversee any inquiry. A decision is yet to be made on what form any inquiry could take.</p> <p>In the Commons Cameron put pressure on Miliband over Labour's links with the Co-op Bank after it emerged that donations and loans of more than \u00a31m from the struggling financial institution had increased under Flowers's chairmanship.</p> <p>\"What we can now see is that this bank, driven into the wall by this chairman, has been giving soft loans to the Labour party, facilities to the Labour party, donations to the Labour party, trooped in and out of Downing Street under Labour, still advising the leader of the Labour party,\" he said.</p> <p>\"And yet, now we know, all along they knew about his past. Why did they do nothing to bring to the attention of the authorities this man who has broken a bank?\"</p> <p>Police have searched the home of Flowers, a Methodist minister who led the bank for three years, after he was filmed allegedly buying and using hard drugs including crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine.</p> <p>Grant Shapps, the Conservative chairman, called on Miliband and Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, to \"come clean on their relationship with Paul Flowers\".</p> <p>However, Michael Dugher, a senior Labour MP, said any inquiry should also examine the role of Mark Hoban, a former Treasury minister, who met Co-op around 30 times.</p> <p>Flowers has told MPs on the Treasury committee that Hoban, a Tory finance minister, \"encouraged\" Co-op's plan to buy 630 branches from Lloyds in \"many, many telephone conversations and meetings\".</p> <p>A review would also look at the appointment of Flowers, who had little financial experience, and struggled to answer basic questions about the bank's balance sheet during the hearing with MPs several weeks ago.</p> <p>Downing Street sources later said that a decision on whether there should be an inquiry was expected \"relatively soon\".</p> <p>Among the options being discussed with regulators by Osborne was a new power introduced last year for the chancellor to establish an independently-led inquiry.</p> <p>A senior Labour source said that the government had questions to answer about reports of 30 meetings with the Co-op at a time when it was being encouraged to take over Lloyds branches.

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has raised the prospect of an inquiry into the Co-op Bank over its financial struggles and embarrassing revelations about its former chairman, Paul Flowers. The prime minister described Flowers as the \"man who has broken a bank\" following questions about his financial competence, drug-taking and resignation as a Bradford councillor over adult material on his computer. It comes after the Co-op Bank \u2013 traditionally an ethical mutual \u2013 hit serious financial difficulties and had to be bailed out by the US hedge funds that owned its debt. In a boisterous session of prime minister's questions, Cameron raised questions over Flowers's suitability to run the bank. He claimed Labour must have known about the bank chairman's past when his appointment was approved by regulators under the last government. \"The chancellor will be discussing with the regulators what is the appropriate form of inquiry to get to the bottom of what went wrong here,\" he said. \"But there are clearly a lot of questions that have to be answered. Why was Rev Flowers judged suitable to be chairman of a bank? Why weren't alarm bells ringing earlier, particularly by those who knew? \"I think it will be important in the coming days that if anyone does have information they stand up and provide it to the authorities.\" Cameron's comments raise the prospect of the government using its new powers, introduced in 2012 in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis, to force a regulator to conduct an inquiry. It would be expected to pre-date 2012 and might even cover the period back to 2009 when the Co-op merged with the Britannia Building Society. Three potential options are up for consideration \u2013 a criminal inquiry, which West Yorkshire police have already indicated they are considering, inquiries by the two City regulators \u2013 the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 which the coalition created last year, and an independent-style inquiry which would in all likelihood only take place once the other inquiries had run their course. None of the investigations into the near collapse of banks during the 2008 crisis have been independent. The City regulator at the time, the Financial Services Authority, launched its own review into what went wrong at Royal Bank of Scotland, while publication of a review into why HBOS collapsed has yet to be published more than five years after the bank was rescued by Lloyds Banking Group. The coalition could task the new regulatory bodies to conduct an inquiry into the collapse of the Co-op and appoint an individual to oversee any inquiry. A decision is yet to be made on what form any inquiry could take. In the Commons Cameron put pressure on Miliband over Labour's links with the Co-op Bank after it emerged that donations and loans of more than \u00a31m from the struggling financial institution had increased under Flowers's chairmanship. \"What we can now see is that this bank, driven into the wall by this chairman, has been giving soft loans to the Labour party, facilities to the Labour party, donations to the Labour party, trooped in and out of Downing Street under Labour, still advising the leader of the Labour party,\" he said. \"And yet, now we know, all along they knew about his past. Why did they do nothing to bring to the attention of the authorities this man who has broken a bank?\" Police have searched the home of Flowers, a Methodist minister who led the bank for three years, after he was filmed allegedly buying and using hard drugs including crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine. Grant Shapps, the Conservative chairman, called on Miliband and Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, to \"come clean on their relationship with Paul Flowers\". However, Michael Dugher, a senior Labour MP, said any inquiry should also examine the role of Mark Hoban, a former Treasury minister, who met Co-op around 30 times. Flowers has told MPs on the Treasury committee that Hoban, a Tory finance minister, \"encouraged\" Co-op's plan to buy 630 branches from Lloyds in \"many, many telephone conversations and meetings\". A review would also look at the appointment of Flowers, who had little financial experience, and struggled to answer basic questions about the bank's balance sheet during the hearing with MPs several weeks ago. Downing Street sources later said that a decision on whether there should be an inquiry was expected \"relatively soon\". Among the options being discussed with regulators by Osborne was a new power introduced last year for the chancellor to establish an independently-led inquiry. A senior Labour source said that the government had questions to answer about reports of 30 meetings with the Co-op at a time when it was being encouraged to take over Lloyds branches. He described Cameron's inquiry suggestion as \"a rather desperate political distraction\". Asked whether Labour would back an inquiry, he replied: \"It depends what the inquiry is into.\" The Labour source added: \"I am not saying that there needs to be an inquiry. I am saying that there are questions to be answered.\"",

Revealing the thinking behind the decision to leave policy unchanged at its meeting earlier this month, Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee said inflation had fallen more quickly than anticipated and there was no immediate threat to the economy from cost pressures. Minutes of the November meeting show that all nine MPC members agreed to keep official interest rates at 0.5% and to maintain the stock of government bonds bought under the Bank's quantitative easing programme at \u00a3375bn. Although the Bank is expecting the economy to grow by 0.9% in the final three months of 2013, the MPC is unsure both about the durability of the recovery and the extent to which growth in the economy's supply capacity will keep pace with rising demand for goods and services. In August, the Bank provided forward guidance in which it said it would not consider raising interest rates before unemployment fell to 7% \u2013 unless there was a threat from inflation or a housing bubble. The latest set of labour market data showed the jobless rate falling to 7.6%. The minutes admit that the Bank's projections showing inflation falling next year as output returns to its pre-recession levels are likely to be wrong, but add that provided there are no signs of an inflationary mentality becoming embedded there could be a case for not raising interest rates even when unemployment reaches the 7% threshold. \"Once unemployment had reached 7%, the committee would reassess what it had learned about the nature of the recovery\", the minutes say. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the minutes \"arguably strike a quite dovish tone in expressing 'uncertainty over the durability of the recovery' and suggesting that the slack in the economy will be 'eroded only gradually'.\"",

    "webTitle": "JP Morgan Chase agrees record $13bn settlement charges over toxic mortgages", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "JP Morgan Chase, the biggest bank in the United States, agreed a record $13bn (\u00a38bn) settlement with regulators on Tuesday, ending months of tense negotiations with the Justice Department over a string of investigations into its risky mortgage deals. The fine, the biggest civil settlement with any single company, ends several investigations and lawsuits brought by the US authorities related to the sale of home loan bonds between 2005 and 2008. It is more than three times the previous record $4bn fine the US levied against BP for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Settlement talks have been fraught and lengthy. JP Morgan chief executive Jamie Dimon went to the US Justice Department to personally negotiate with attorney general Eric Holder in September, a personal summit that led some critics to claim that Holder was giving the bank special treatment. Tuesday\u2019s agreement staves off a costly and potentially embarrassing trial. As part of the settlement, JP Morgan acknowledged it made serious misrepresentations to the public \u2013 including to investors \u2013 about numerous transactions relating to residential mortgage-backed securities. The deals collapsed in 2008 when the housing market plunged and the scale of the risks was exposed, and the resulting financial tumult led to the biggest crisis since the Great Depression. The admission was a major victory for the Justice Department. Banks have fought shy of such statements fearing yet more legal actions from investors. The settlement leaves open the possibility of potential criminal charges. \u201cWithout a doubt, the conduct uncovered in this investigation helped sow the seeds of the mortgage meltdown,\u201d said Holder. \u201cJP Morgan was not the only financial institution during this period to knowingly bundle toxic loans and sell them to unsuspecting investors, but that is no excuse for the firm\u2019s behavior.\u201d \u201cThe size and scope of this resolution should send a clear signal that the Justice Department\u2019s financial fraud investigations are far from over. No firm, no matter how profitable, is above the law, and the passage of time is no shield from accountability,\u201d Holder said. The settlement was negotiated through the residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) working group, a joint state and federal initiative formed in 2012 to investigate wrongdoing in the mortgage-backed securities market prior to the financial crisis. Holder said the group\u2019s investigations were \u201congoing\u201d. John Coffee, a Columbia law school professor, said the fine was in marked contrast to the $1.9bn penalty Holder brought against HSBC for money laundering last December. \u201cIn that case he seemed to suggest some institutions were \u2018too big to jail\u2019,\u201d said Coffee. In this case, Coffee said, Holder was still looking to bring charges against individuals in the future. Coffee said the US authorities had so far struggled to charge senior individuals over the excesses of the financial crisis. \u201cBut the government is still looking. We may yet see another shoe drop,\u201d he said. JP Morgan sailed through the financial crisis relatively unharmed, but has been beset by legal woes in the crisis's aftermath. The fine is the latest, and largest, in a series that has led for some shareholders to call for Dimon\u2019s resignation despite the bank's financial success and its solid share price: \u2022 Earlier this month, the bank paid $4.5bn to settle allegations it has mis-sold mortgage bonds to pension funds and other institutional investors. \u2022 In September, the company paid $920m to settle US investigations into the \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading scandal. \u2022 In the same month, JP Morgan paid another $390m in refunds and $80m in settlement for billing credit card customers for identity theft protection they did not receive. \u2022 In July, the bank paid $410m in penalties and repayments related to alleged manipulation of California and midwest electricity markets. The latest fine stems in large part from allegations of mis-selling of \u201ctoxic\u201d mortgage securities by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, two firms JP Morgan purchased during the 2008 financial crisis at the behest of the government. Of the $13bn resolution, $9bn will be paid to settle federal and state civil claims by various entities related to RMBS. The heavily trailed agreement appears to have been delayed by arguments over the consumer-relief component of the pact that constitutes the remaining $4bn of the deal. That money will be used to reduce urban blight in areas such as Detroit, where the sub-prime crisis worsened an already struggling housing market and left many homes abandoned. They money will also be used to offer lower rate loans to low-income home buyers. About $1.4bn will go to the National Credit Union Administration. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement by the Justice Department is extraordinary, and will greatly benefit credit unions that have been paying for the losses caused by the financial institutions covered by this settlement,\u201d NCUA chairman Debbie Matz said. Brian Kettenring, executive director of the Campaign for a Fair Settlement, said the size of the settlement was a \u201cshow of progress toward holding banks accountable for repeatedly breaking the law.\u201d \u201cCriminal prosecution is still needed to deter future crimes. But more and likely better relief for struggling homeowners is a hard-earned victory for people across the country who have spoken out\u2014and even gone to jail\u2014demanding an end to Wall Street impunity,\u201d he said. Deborah Castillo, a member of pressure group Home Defenders League who lost her home to foreclosure said: \u201cJPMorgan Chase should halt foreclosures while the settlement is implemented and make a good faith work with the homeowners in our communities who need fair modifications. I hope that funds from this settlement will quickly get to homeowners, who have waited far too long for relief, and are really used to help the families who are struggling and prevent the crime of more empty houses in our communities.\u201d While this agreement ends a troubled chapter for the bank, other issues remain. A criminal investigation of the bank over mortgages will continue. The bank is also under scrutiny for its hiring practices in China, its massive \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading losses and its relationship with Bernie Madoff, the Ponzi scheme fraudster.",

A criminal investigation of the bank over mortgages will continue. The bank is also under scrutiny for its hiring practices in China, its massive \u201cLondon Whale\u201d trading losses and its relationship with Bernie Madoff, the Ponzi scheme fraudster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4004a13b-292f-4d8e-8bd8-686edaf1838d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/19/1384905458703/ad202ee4-b88e-4f2c-95ff-eb1204344a92-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"President Barack Obama speaking at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting in Washington.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Barack Obama speaking at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting in Washington.
