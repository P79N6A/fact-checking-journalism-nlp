      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, had his \u201cfingers in the till\u201d of the failed retailer and \u201cthreatened to kill\u201d its chief executive after he was confronted about taking money out of the business, according to explosive allegations made to MPs. Chappell allegedly made the threat to Darren Topp after he was accused of theft for moving \u00a31.5m out of BHS, days before administrators were called into the company in April. Topp told MPs he considered calling police over the money transfer and was threatened by Chappell when he confronted him. \u201cI said to him \u2018that\u2019s theft\u2019,\u201d said Topp. \u201cNow, if you take out all of the expletives, he basically said: \u2018Do not kick off about this, Darren. I have had enough of you telling me what to do over the last few months. It\u2019s my business, I can do what I want. If you kick off about it I\u2019m going to come down and kill you.\u2019 \u201cThen he threatened to kill me again, and I know it sounds silly, but apparently he says he was in the helicopter squad of the SAS, and I know he has got a gun.\u201d Other allegations from the hearing into the collapse of BHS, which has put 11,000 jobs at risk, included: Chappell claiming that retail tycoon Sir Philip Green, who sold the business to him, was to blame for its collapse. that Green went \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out that BHS was in talks with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct about a rescue deal, so he blocked it and forced BHS into administration. Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions, collected at least \u00a317m from BHS despite owning it for just 13 months. the consortium put none of its own funds into BHS, instead the \u00a315m it injected into BHS came from a \u00a35m loan from a property company and \u00a310m from Green. Chappell later claimed allegations by Topp of a death threat were \u201ca nonsense\u201d. After the hearing, he told the Guardian: \u201cWhat I said to him was \u2018when I get back to the office I will fucking sort you out\u2019.\u201d Chappell said he meant he was going to fire Topp but let it go because of the \u201cgravity of what was going on\u201d. Topp also alleged Retail Acquisitions took \u00a31.8m from the sale of the company and also \u00a37m from the \u00a332m sale of BHS\u2019s offices at North West House in Marylebone, north London, in March 2015. He said Chappell\u2019s promises to save BHS had \u201cunravelled\u201d and by the end he had \u201chis fingers in the till\u201d. BHS\u2019s former financial consultant, Michael Hitchcock, who was sat alongside Topp, added: \u201cI think I was duped. I think the technical term is a mythomaniac. The lay person\u2019s term is he was a premier league liar and a Sunday pub league retailer, at best.\u201d The revelations raise the prospect of a criminal investigation into the affair, while posing further questions for Green, the Topshop boss who controlled BHS for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions in March 2015. MPs on the work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee are investigating BHS after it collapsed with a pension deficit of \u00a3571m. Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his tenure at BHS. Green will be questioned by MPs next Wednesday. Chappell, who about admitted he \u201cknew nothing\u201d about retail before buying the company, apologised for the collapse of BHS. \u201cI am very upset that there are 11,000 people directly and a number of thousands of people indirectly who have lost their jobs. It is a travesty that it happened. I am very upset that it happened, and it was avoidable,\u201d Chappell said. \u201cAs majority shareholder and owner of BHS I must stand forward and say we were part of the downfall of BHS.\u201d However, Chappell heavily criticised Green\u2019s role in the demise of BHS and said he is considering legal action against the tycoon and his company, Arcadia. Chappell claimed there had been \u201clittle or no inward investment for 10 or 12 years\u201d in BHS, that Green had failed to arrange credit insurance for BHS, meaning it had to pay more to suppliers, and that the company had taken a \u201cbattering\u201d and had been \u201cheld to ransom\u201d by Green\u2019s dispute with the Pensions Regulator over whether he should be forced to inject cash into its pension scheme. \u201cWe took him as a man of his word and he did not keep his word,\u201d Chappell said of Green\u2019s failure to arrange credit insurance. \u201cI think if Philip had assisted us, we could have saved BHS.\u201d Chappell said that Green called in \u00a335m of debt owed to Arcadia after finding out that BHS was trying to reach a rescue deal with Sports Direct, thereby blocking the deal. \u201cWhen Philip found out about it, he went absolutely insane, screaming and shouting down the phone saying he didn\u2019t want to deal with Mike Ashley,\u201d Chappell said. However, Chappell became increasingly riled by MPs as they probed a series of transactions involving Retail Acquisitions, including a \u00a31.5m loan against his family home that he claimed was used to remortgage the property. Chappell said this was \u201csideshow\u201d and accused MPs of being \u201cvery personal\u201d. He prompted gasps from the audience when he added: \u201cThis is a company that was losing millions of pounds a month, what difference would that have made in the grand scheme of things.\u201d Chappell admitted he had personally made a profit from BHS, but declined to say how much, telling MPs he would provide them with a spreadsheet showing transactions between himself, Retail Acquisitions and BHS. Chappell claimed he had earned the money made from BHS and said Retail Acquisitions \u201cdid everything in our powers\u201d to save BHS. A spokesman for Arcadia said: \u201cSir Philip will attempt to correct multiple inaccuracies when he addresses the committee next week.\u201d He denied that Arcadia had pushed BHS into administration, saying: \u201cWe had no knowledge of any rescue deal when the letter [asking for debt repayment] was sent on the Friday [before administrators were called in]. Rescue talks continued over the weekend, and when they failed the company called in administrators. \u201cSir Philip provided BHS with ample funding and gave it every opportunity to thrive under new ownership.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "The six key questions that MPs must ask Sir Philip Green", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green faces tough questions over the collapse of BHS when he appears in front of MPs next week. And the stakes have been raised following the latest round of evidence in Westminster from Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, and the retailer\u2019s senior management team. These are the key questions that MPs now need to put to Green: Why were you in such a hurry to sell BHS? Chappell told MPs the board of Arcadia, Green\u2019s retail business, had decided it would not put any more money into BHS. So Green either needed to sell the company or put it into liquidation before a \u00a350m quarterly rent bill turned up in March 2015. Is that correct? Why did you think Dominic Chappell was an appropriate buyer? Chappell told MPs he revealed to Arcadia that he had been declared bankrupt and admitted he had no retail experience. Why did Green then believe that Chappell could succeed where he had failed? Chappell claimed that Green \u201cgenuinely thought\u201d Retail Acquisitions would fail to turn around BHS. Did you block Chappell from talking to the Pensions Regulator? According to Chappell, Green blocked him from talking to the Pensions Regulator until the deal to sell BHS was complete. That is odd given BHS\u2019s pension scheme had a significant deficit and needed to be restructured. Chappell also claimed that Green\u2019s ongoing wrangles with the Pensions Regulator were partly responsible for the collapse of the business. Did you break a promise to arrange credit insurance for BHS? Credit insurance is vital for a retailer. It means a supplier is insured when they sell products to a retailer, which protects them from unexpected events or the collapse of the retailer. Retailers without credit insurance have to pay funds up front to suppliers, which is a heavy burden. Chappell claims that Green promised to ensure that BHS had the credit insurers onside but it lost credit insurance, which put major pressure on the company\u2019s balance sheet. How much did you know about Chappell\u2019s deal with the Dellal family? Ace, a property company owned by the Dellal family, provided \u00a335m to Chappell so he could demonstrate his credibility to Arcadia. However, evidence from the Dellals and Chappell shows this \u00a335m was then meant to be spent on buying Marylebone House, the offices of BHS, which was owned by Green. The plan was for Green to sell the building to Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions for \u00a335m, paid for with the funds provided by Ace, with the building then being sold to Ace for \u00a345m, which would then pay Retail Acquisitions another \u00a310m. This looks like it could be a roundabout way of Green paying Retail Acquisitions \u00a310m. Is that what it was? And why, when the deal fell apart, did Green feel the need to pay Retail Acquisitions \u00a310m, as Chappell claimed? Did you block a BHS rescue deal with Sports Direct? Chappell said Green went \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out BHS was in talks about Sports Direct buying the company, which was just days before it fell into administration. Was there a plausible deal in place? If so, why did you block it?",

The plan was for Green to sell the building to Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions for \u00a335m, paid for with the funds provided by Ace, with the building then being sold to Ace for \u00a345m, which would then pay Retail Acquisitions another \u00a310m. This looks like it could be a roundabout way of Green paying Retail Acquisitions \u00a310m. Is that what it was? And why, when the deal fell apart, did Green feel the need to pay Retail Acquisitions \u00a310m, as Chappell claimed?</p> <p><strong>Did you block a BHS rescue deal with Sports Direct?</strong></p> <p>Chappell said Green went \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/24/bhs-on-the-brink-of-collapse-unless-60m-pounds-funding-found\">BHS was in talks about Sports Direct</a> buying the company, which was just days before it fell into administration. Was there a plausible deal in place? If so, why did you block it?<br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Death threats; hasty transfers of cash to Sweden; an unexplained \u00a31.5m loan to a company that owned his father\u2019s house. Yes, it\u2019s another instalment from life in the slow lane of department store retailing. As it happens Dominic Chappell denied menacing BHS chief executive Darren Topp. And Chappell maintained, in the face of obvious scepticism among MPs on the business select committee, that there were innocent explanations for the cash transfers whizzing in and out of BHS and his Retail Acquisitions company. Yet one conclusion was crystal-clear from Wednesday\u2019s arresting session in Westminster: nobody could view Chappell, a former bankrupt, as ever being a fit owner of a loss-making chain of department stores with 11,000 employees and a large deficit in its pension fund. Chappell \u2013 regardless of whether he is \u201cmythomaniac\u201d and a \u201cPremier League liar,\u201d as BHS\u2019s former financial consultant put it \u2013 was plainly foolish to buy the business from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 in the first place. Chappell grumbled that the stores were shockingly under-invested, but he was free to inspect them beforehand. His working capital arrangements for a business losing \u00a31.5m a week appeared to be an exercise in hope and high-interest loans. And, most absurdly, he seemingly failed to appreciate that the deficit in the pension fund \u2013 a colossal \u00a3571m on one count \u2013 might scupper any theoretical possibility of reversing BHS\u2019s fortunes. This was despite Chappell\u2019s account that he was warned by Green not to approach the Pensions Regulator, on pain of seeing the deal pulled. A 10-year-old would have twigged that it would be in his own interests to get to the bottom of the unresolved pension issue; after all, the deal, as originally conceived, had excluded the pension liabilities, or so the MPs were told. Instead, Chappell carried on regardless. Whether Chappell was motivated by greed, naivety or incompetence is one question. Another is whether Green and his advisers enticed Chappell to the table. Green\u2019s version of events is keenly awaited. It would also be sensible for the MPs to recall Goldman Sachs\u2019 Anthony Gutman, whose role as an unpaid go-between in the negotiations was originally under-appreciated, given the dozens of emails that have subsequently been produced to the committee. In the end, however, this complicated affair boils down to a few simple points. Green and his Monaco-based wife enjoyed the lion\u2019s share of \u00a3400m in dividends paid out by BHS over the years. Yet Green sold the business to an individual who was never likely to save BHS because he lacked talent and funds. And the losers are the BHS staff plus 20,000 pensioners whose scheme has now fallen into Pension Protection Fund, which is funded by a levy on other defined-benefit funds. That same BHS scheme had been in surplus when Green bought BHS in 2000. View Wednesday\u2019s session, then, as a warm-up before Green\u2019s appearance next week. The billionaire faces two tasks. First, explain why he gave Chappell the time of day, let alone ownership of BHS. Second, announce how much he is prepared to contribute to repair the hole in the pension fund; the moral obligation to cough up looks as plain as it did on the day of BHS\u2019s collapse. Sorrell\u2019s pay packet under fire Defending Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s indefensible \u00a370m pay package is not easy, but WPP chairman Roberto Quarta could surely have done better than this watery line delivered to one protesting shareholder at Wednesday\u2019s annual meeting: \u201cRest assured we hear your comments and your voice today and certainly we will take them into account as we \u2026 consult at the end of the year.\u201d This is nonsense. Sorrell\u2019s pay is out of the door already. Even if a majority of shareholders, rather than a third, had rebelled against WPP\u2019s remuneration report, the company would have been compelled to do precisely nothing because the vote was advisory. Nor will WPP change a thing for next year. The incentive scheme that produced Sorrell\u2019s mighty rewards \u2013 known as Leap, or leadership equity acquisition plan \u2013 has one more year to run and WPP won\u2019t be altering it. Those investors who find \u00a370m hard to stomach will have to console themselves that Sorrell\u2019s maximum in the current financial year will be \u201conly\u201d \u00a340m. At that point, Leap expires, to be replaced by a scheme under which Sorrell\u2019s maximum bonus is \u00a311m. That change followed a shareholder rebellion back in 2012. Maybe Quarta\u2019s promised consultation referred to the possibility of reducing Sorrell\u2019s maximum annual jackpot to less than \u00a310m. But one doubts it.

Citi\u2019s UK boss, James Bardrick, told staff in an email that a vote to sever links with Brussels would have implications for the business. \u201cAhead of the referendum, we have been carefully reviewing the situation and contingency planning around a number of areas, including our organisational footprint and where we book business,\u201d he said. \u201cA vote to leave the EU is likely to have implications for our UK operations.

Bardrick said the email had been sent because the bank was receiving an increasing number of queries about what the outcome of the 23 June referendum would mean for the organisation, its clients and UK-based employees.

      "bodyText": "When I worked on a factory production line in Birmingham in the mid-1960s, working conditions were, if anything, worse than those described by Felicity Lawrence, minus the electronic tagging and security searches perhaps, but plus the noise and dirt (A brutal and inhumane way to treat staff, and Sports Direct is not alone, Opinion, 8 June). The workrate was controlled by the speed of the line, much as in the great Chaplin film, Modern Times. So what was different? We were well paid, had permanent contracts, fixed hours and overtime. We were 100% unionised and prepared to strike if managers were seen to be out of order. But the thing that really equalised power relations was full employment. Labour was in short supply, even with high levels of immigration. Managers generally worked to retain workers and provided facilities well beyond the job, such as subsidised or free meals in works canteens, even hairdressers at M&amp;S, sports and social clubs, factory outings, bonuses for length of service and so on. At the end of the day, workers knew they could walk away and find an equally well paid, if equally tedious, job almost immediately. So what matters at least as much as collective muscle, as advocated by Lawrence, is the economic environment created by government policy. For over 30 years following the second world war, policy was to maintain full employment. Without this, even with strong unions, workers will be reluctant to exercise their rights for fear of dismissal. It is no accident that wages have fallen well behind as a share of national income and that working conditions have generally worsened in the decades since a policy of full employment was replaced, under Thatcher, by the use of unemployment as a policy instrument to restrain workers\u2019 power in the workplace. Power relations will remain skewed until full employment is restored. Not only will this increase equality in the workplace, it will reduce the costs to the state of subsidising unemployment via the benefits system, and low wages via tax credits. It is government policy that has created the conditions for the Ashleys of this world to flourish, not some act of God. Roy Boffy Walsall, West Midlands \u2022 Following the death of 1110 people in the collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh in 2013, the Bangladesh Fire and Safety Accord was established. This legally binding agreement guarantees safe and decent working conditions for garment workers in Bangladesh. Despite public outcry Sports Direct was one of only two major British companies which refused to sign the accord. Stephen Brown, UK country director of Global Poverty Project, said at the time: \u201cSports Direct is sourcing from unsafe factories in Bangladesh. Workers are expected to work long hours, for very little, in unsafe conditions. We hope that Sports Direct spends some of its huge profits on joining with 90 other retailers to improve conditions rather than further lining the pockets of its owners.\u201d Sounds familiar? Sister Gillian Price Much Hadham, Hertfordshire \u2022 Your editorial (8 June) suggests a responsibility of recent governments for the appalling working conditions at Sports Direct. But your reference to the role of tax credits is in danger of vilifying a policy upon which millions of wage-poor households rely and, ironically, divesting Mike Ashley of responsibility for Sports Direct\u2019s actions. The evidence that tax credits cause low wages and poor working conditions is not established, but the idea draws upon a lineage of argument \u2013 most recently used by George Osborne to justify cuts to tax credits and universal credit \u2013 that is more concerned with criticising collective provision as an inhibitor of free markets, than highlighting the problems of capitalism. Your editorial also suggests, by implication, that capitalism has an acceptable face. This, too, is difficult to support. Capitalism is premised upon destructive practices, such as competition and exploitation, which are fundamental to its operation, rather than being encouraged by state support for the poorest wage workers. Dr Chris Grover Senior lecturer in social policy, Lancaster University \u2022 Employee rights in this country are rightly protected by comprehensive legislation. Even if employees at Sports Direct were afraid of \u201cwhistleblowing\u201d, they could have done this anonymously by complaining to HMRC, or they could have pooled funds and approached an employment lawyer to represent them. Clearly, it is unlawful to dilute earnings below the minimum rate and Sports Direct should repay all underpayments in full, with interest, and should be penalised appropriately. However, if Sports Direct wishes to use zero-hours contracts or fire employees after six significant failings in six months, it is a perfect right to do so. The Guardian would do better to focus on the effects of global markets and of uncontrolled immigration when looking at why unskilled workers in the UK are suffering in the manner they are, and look closer at businesses that are importing products produced by sweated labour in the far east. Tim Elster Ashbourne, Derbyshire \u2022 What are the qualifications for being on a select committee? A functioning ability to ask a searching question may be a start, I suggest. Nils Pratley (Financial, 8 June) is spot on as usual. The trailed \u201cgrilling\u201d turned out to be only a \u201clight toasting\u201d. Someone should give the committee members tuition in asking follow-up questions. I am prepared to come out of retirement (former judge), if I get the call. David Shannon Woore, Shropshire \u2022 Mike Ashley in his responses to the parliamentary committee revealed in microcosm the vital role that corruption \u2013 dishonest or illegal behaviour by the powerful \u2013 plays in everything we celebrate as success in this country. Probably Ashley\u2019s biggest crime is being outwith the establishment that built this corruption to protect itself.

      "body": "<p>When I worked on a factory production line in Birmingham in the mid-1960s, working conditions were, if anything, worse than those described by Felicity Lawrence, minus the electronic tagging and security searches perhaps, but plus the noise and dirt (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/08/inhumane-sports-direct-mike-ashley-workforce\" title=\"\">A brutal and inhumane way to treat staff, and Sports Direct is not alone, </a>Opinion, 8 June). The workrate was controlled by the speed of the line, much as in the great Chaplin film, Modern Times. So what&#xa0;was different? We were well paid, had permanent contracts, fixed hours and overtime. We were 100% unionised and prepared to strike if managers were seen to be out of order. But the thing that really equalised power relations was full employment.</p> <p>Labour was in short supply, even with high levels of immigration. Managers generally worked to retain workers and provided facilities well beyond the job, such as subsidised or free meals in works canteens, even hairdressers at M&amp;S, sports and social clubs, factory outings, bonuses for length of service and so on. At the end of the day, workers knew they could walk away and find an equally well paid, if equally tedious, job almost immediately. So what matters at least as much as collective muscle, as advocated by Lawrence, is the economic environment created by government policy. For over 30 years following the second world war, policy was to maintain full employment. Without this, even with strong unions, workers will be reluctant to exercise their rights for fear of dismissal.</p> <p>It is no accident that wages have fallen well behind as a share of national income and that working conditions have generally worsened in the decades since a policy of full employment was replaced, under Thatcher, by the use of unemployment as a policy instrument to restrain workers\u2019 power in the workplace. Power relations will remain skewed until full employment is restored. Not only will this increase equality in the workplace, it will reduce the costs to the state of subsidising unemployment via the benefits system, and low wages via tax credits. It is government policy that has created the conditions for the Ashleys of this world to flourish, not some act of God. <br><strong>Roy Boffy</strong><br><em>Walsall, West Midlands</em></p> <p>\u2022 Following the death of 1110 people in the collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh in 2013, the Bangladesh Fire and Safety Accord was established. This legally binding agreement guarantees safe and decent working conditions for garment workers in Bangladesh. Despite public outcry Sports Direct was one of only two major British companies which refused to sign the accord.</p> <p>Stephen Brown, UK country director of Global Poverty Project, said at the time: \u201cSports Direct is sourcing from unsafe factories in Bangladesh. Workers are expected to work long hours, for very little, in unsafe conditions. We hope that Sports Direct spends some of its huge profits on joining with 90 other retailers to improve conditions rather than further lining the pockets of its owners.\u201d</p> <p>Sounds familiar?</p> <p><strong>Sister Gillian Price </strong><br><em>Much Hadham, Hertfordshire</em><br></p> <p>\u2022 Your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/07/the-guardian-view-on-mike-ashley-unacceptable-face-of-modern-capitalism\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (8 June) suggests a responsibility of recent governments for the appalling working conditions at Sports Direct.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The use of migrant workers in the US seafood supply chain has led to the creation of exploitative conditions that are equivalent to forced labor, according to a report released on Wednesday. The report was released by the National Guestworker Alliance (NGA) and is based on previous findings as well as interviews with 126 seafood processing workers in New Bedford, Massachusetts, and a range of in-depth case studies. In order to succeed in a highly competitive global market, US seafood processors have increasingly come to rely on temporary labor. Such workers include H-2B visa laborers as well as undocumented workers. Their immigration status makes these workers vulnerable to exploitation. The NGA found that these workers were unlikely to report abuse on the job due to threats from employers not to hire them in subsequent seasons and sponsor them for H-2B visa. Undocumented workers have been threatened with immigration enforcement. \u201cThis new research exposes a reality that workers know all too well,\u201d said Daniel Castellanos, former H-2B guest worker and a co-founder of the NGA. \u201cSeafood processing workers are routinely subjected to severe forms of exploitation by companies producing cheap seafood for major retailers and food distributors like Walmart. And when they speak out or try to resist abuse, they are punished severely for it.\u201d A Walmart spokeswoman told the Guardian that the company cares about the men and women in its supply chain. \u201cWalmart\u2019s standards for suppliers lists our social and environmental expectations for our suppliers, specifically addressing working conditions, voluntary labor, pay, the cultivation of a safe and healthy work environment, and freedom of association,\u201d she said. \u201cWalmart also is committed to participating in collaborative efforts with external stakeholders to advance the goal of identifying risk and building a more transparent supply chain, including participation in industry groups that serve as a vehicle to share experiences and gain new information that can help improve operations and the global supply chains as a whole.\u201d Among the indicators of forced labor detected by NGA in the US supply chain were verbal abuse, curfews, threats of denunciation to immigration authorities and poor treatment by supervisors. Those workers surveyed also reported having their wages stolen, not being paid overtime, and being paid less than originally promised. According to the report, a majority of workers processing scallops and groundfish in the large plants in New Bedford were hired on a temporary basis. The NGA also referenced a 2009 report that found nearly 75% of seafood processing workers in the city \u201cwere undocumented migrants, generally hired through temp agencies\u201d. In Louisiana, seafood employers rely heavily on H-2B visa workers. According to the NGA, utilization of H-2B visas among seafood employers tripled between 1990 and 2000. \u201cIn the 1970s, when I started my business, I was lucky enough to have the refugees from Vietnam come in, so we brought in roughly 40 of them to help us through that time,\u201d Frank Randol, president of Louisiana-based crawfish processor Randol Inc told Congress last year. \u201cOver the course of the years, we came to the 1990s when that started to wane just a little bit, we discovered the H-2B program and started bringing in the guestworkers from Mexico.\u201d Randol described the jobs at his processing plant as \u201cone of America\u2019s least desired jobs\u201d and said that union activity has made it difficult for him to hire workers. The NGA report was released at the end of the International Labour Conference, which is currently being held in Geneva. The NGA has called on the International Labour Organization (ILO) to \u201cmove towards a binding legal convention regulating global value chains\u201d. The alliance also asked the ILO to organize a conference to explore the adverse impact of contracting and purchasing practices on migrant workers\u2019 rights, and to assemble research on how purchasing practices of multinational corporations affect core labor standards and the wages and benefits of workers. \u201cEven on the end of seafood supply chains in the US, competition from low-cost producers in Asia and elsewhere has created a powerful incentive for US processors to cut labor costs through wage theft, unsafe working conditions and at times forced labor conditions,\u201d said JJ Rosenbaum, the NGA\u2019s legal adviser. \u201cAs the report shows, the ILO\u2019s role ensuring decent work including living wages and the right to organize for all supply chain workers is fundamental to reverse the race to the bottom and support workers and their organizations in raising standards.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Sir Martin Sorrell at sharp end of investor revolt at WPP AGM", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell and the board of WPP faced a barrage of criticism at their annual general meeting after a third of shareholders opposed the \u00a370m pay package handed to Sorrell, chief executive of the world\u2019s biggest advertising company. At the AGM in London, 33.5% of shareholders voted against WPP\u2019s remuneration report and 66.5% backed it. Including abstentions 34.2% of investors failed to support the report. The vote was the third worst suffered by WPP, where Sorrell\u2019s pay has irked shareholders for many years. Standard Life and Hermes, two of Britain\u2019s most influential fund managers, voted against the pay report and sent senior officers to the meeting. Euan Stirling, head of corporate governance at Standard Life, said WPP\u2019s current pay plan could hand Sorrell more than 15 times his \u00a31.15m salary. \u201cWe expect that is more than would be required to recruit, retain or motivate even someone with the redoubtable talents of Mr Sorrell.\u201d Deborah Gilshan, corporate governance counsel at the Railways Pension Scheme, said pay at WPP was \u201ca risk to its reputation and its licence to operate\u201d from society. The WPP chairman, Roberto Quarta, told Gilshan: \u201cRest assured we hear your comments and your voice today and certainly we will take them into account as we \u2026 consult at the end of the year.\u201d The revolt over Sorrell\u2019s pay is the latest in a string of defeats and bruising protests for company boards this year. Starting with the 60% vote against BP boss Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay two months ago, big shareholders have taken issue with the size of some executive pay deals. Quarta said WPP would take account of investors\u2019 change of mood as the company puts together a new pay policy for a binding vote next year. Sorrell, 71, who started WPP from scratch using borrowed money in 1985, said the idea from the start was that he would have a big stake in the company and run it as an owner. He has reinvested all his pay into WPP and only took money out to pay for his divorce in 2005. \u201cWPP by virtue of that is unique and should be looked at in a unique way,\u201d he said after the meeting. \u201cIf there is something wrong with building a company from two people to 194,000 people where 600,000 people depend on WPP for their livelihoods then mea culpa.\u201d A small shareholder said questions on pay were pathetic and asked by small-minded people. \u201cIt has all been agreed so I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re carping at.\u201d But another said Sorrell\u2019s dominance of the company meant the board bent to his will because they feared him leaving. Sir John Hood, who chairs WPP\u2019s remuneration committee, said 89% of Sorrell\u2019s share pay was under the incentive plan agreed at the 2009 annual meeting and that a less generous plan was approved by about 80% of shareholders two years ago. He said the company would consider how share plans might play out after WPP\u2019s market value doubled in five years, triggering the big payout. He also said WPP had to pay the rate needed to get the best people in a competitive market.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell and the board of WPP faced a barrage of criticism at their annual general meeting after a third of shareholders opposed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/29/sir-martin-sorrell-70m-in-2015-pay-deal-wpp\">\u00a370m pay package handed to Sorrell, </a>chief executive of the world\u2019s biggest advertising company.</p> <p>At the AGM in London, 33.5% of shareholders voted against WPP\u2019s remuneration report and 66.5% backed it. Including abstentions 34.2% of investors failed to support the report. The vote was the third worst suffered by WPP, where Sorrell\u2019s pay has irked shareholders for many years.</p> <p>Standard Life and Hermes, two of Britain\u2019s most influential fund managers, voted against the pay report and sent senior officers to the meeting.</p> <p>Euan Stirling, head of corporate governance at Standard Life, said WPP\u2019s current pay plan could hand Sorrell more than 15 times his \u00a31.15m salary. \u201cWe expect that is more than would be required to recruit, retain or motivate even someone with the redoubtable talents of Mr Sorrell.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Gilshan, corporate governance counsel at the Railways Pension Scheme, said pay at WPP was \u201ca risk to its reputation and its licence to operate\u201d from society. </p> <p>The WPP chairman, Roberto Quarta, told Gilshan: \u201cRest assured we hear your comments and your voice today and certainly we will take them into account as we \u2026 consult at the end of the year.\u201d<br></p> <p>The revolt over Sorrell\u2019s pay is the latest in a string of defeats and bruising protests for company boards this year. Starting with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bp-pledge-shareholder-anger-ceo-bob-dudleypay-deal\">60% vote against BP boss Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m pay</a> two months ago, big shareholders have taken issue with the size of some executive pay deals.</p> <p>Quarta said WPP would take account of investors\u2019 change of mood as the company puts together a new pay policy for a binding vote next year.</p> <p>Sorrell, 71, who started WPP from scratch using borrowed money in 1985, said the idea from the start was that he would have a big stake in the company and run it as an owner. He has reinvested all his pay into WPP and only took money out to pay for his divorce in 2005.</p> <p>\u201cWPP by virtue of that is unique and should be looked at in a unique way,\u201d he said after the meeting. \u201cIf there is something wrong with building a company from two people to 194,000 people where 600,000 people depend on WPP for their livelihoods then mea culpa.\u201d</p> <p>A small shareholder said questions on pay were pathetic and asked by small-minded people. \u201cIt has all been agreed so I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re carping at.\u201d But another said Sorrell\u2019s dominance of the company meant the board bent to his will because they feared him leaving. <br></p> <p>Sir John Hood, who chairs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wpp\">WPP</a>\u2019s remuneration committee, said 89% of Sorrell\u2019s share pay was under the incentive plan agreed at the 2009 annual meeting and that a less generous plan was approved by about 80% of shareholders two years ago.</p> <p>He said the company would consider how share plans might play out after WPP\u2019s market value doubled in five years, triggering the big payout. He also said WPP had to pay the rate needed to get the best people in a competitive market. </p>",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has lambasted Sports Direct\u2019s \u201cappalling practices\u201d following the admission by the company\u2019s founder that workers have been paid less than the minimum wage. His comments \u2013 which came after Mike Ashley confirmed the findings of a Guardian investigation in front of a parliamentary select committee \u2013 were made as Cameron also rejected calls to ban all zero-hours contracts, which are widely used in the retail industry and do not guarantee employees any work. At prime minister\u2019s questions, Cameron said: \u201cOn the issue of Sports Direct and the appalling practice of not paying the minimum wage: I absolutely abhor it and this government has done more than any previous government to crack down on the non-payment. \u201cWe have levied almost 5,000 penalties since 2010, we continue to name and shame eligible employers when the investigation has been closed, something that didn\u2019t happen before.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are going after unscrupulous employers and making sure that people get the deal that they deserve\u201d. The remarks came as Jeremy Corbyn said he had met workers and discussed the \u201cshocking behaviour\u201d at Sports Direct, including \u201cnon-payment of the minimum wage, a culture of intimidation and fear, on top of the insecurity and exploitation of zero-hours contracts\u201d. The Labour leader also described Ashley, who owns 55% of Sports Direct, as a boss who \u201cwould make Scrooge look like a good employer\u201d. He also called for an outright ban on zero-hours contracts, which many of Sports Direct\u2019s 20,000 workers are on. Cameron insisted some workers want to have the option of a zero-hours contract and stressed he had already banned those that tie employees to one company exclusively. He said: \u201cWe legislated in the last parliament to stop exclusive zero-hours contracts but we followed the conclusions of our consultation that said that we shouldn\u2019t go further than that, and that for some people they want to have the choice of those contracts.\u201d Sports Direct is facing a multimillion-pound bill in fines and back pay after Ashley admitted to the business, innovation and skills committee on Tuesday that his business had broken the law by failing to pay staff the national minimum wage. HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which polices minimum wage abuses, is investigating the company and is in talks with its full-time staff about a deal to top up any wage shortfall with back pay. In December, an undercover Guardian investigation revealed that Sports Direct warehouse staff were required to go through searches at the end of each shift, during which their time was unpaid, and they also suffered deductions from their wage packets for clocking in for a shift just one minute late. The practices contributed to many staff being paid an effective rate of about \u00a36.50 an hour against the then statutory rate of \u00a36.70, which potentially saved the company millions of pounds a year at the expense of some of the poorest workers in the UK. Corbyn also highlighted pro-Brexit ministers\u2019 statements on \u201creducing the burden\u201d on employers of EU protection for workers. He said Cameron should distance himself from comments by the employment minister, Priti Patel, that workers\u2019 rights in EU law were a \u201cburden\u201d. \u201cIt shows we must strengthen and not weaken workers\u2019 rights, especially when there are criminal activities involved,\u201d said Corbyn, citing Patel, who said last month the UK could \u201chalve the burdens\u201d on employers by leaving the EU. \u201cDoes [Patel] speak on behalf of the government when she promises to reduce the burden, as she describes them, of employment legislation?\u201d Corbyn asked, also referring to the justice secretary, Michael Gove, who said he \u201ccould not guarantee every person could keep their job\u201d after a leave vote. Gove appeared \u201cequally relaxed about employment rights\u201d, Corbyn said. \u201cCan\u2019t [Cameron] do something about that?\u201d Cameron said the EU\u2019s underpinning of workers\u2019 rights was one of the reasons many people would vote to stay in, but said the UK went over and above the rights demanded by the EU, on flexible working, maternity leave and shared parental leave, and more annual leave.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares rose for the fourth day in a row as oil prices hit their highest level since early October in volatile trading. With Brent crude currently up more than 1% at $52 a barrel as US oil stocks dropped by more than was forecast and Nigerian production continued to be hit by militant attacks, commodity companies were among the major gainers. Anglo American added 32p to 697.5p, while Glencore was up 5.7p at 145.70p amid a Bloomberg report it was close to selling a10% stake in its agricultural business. Royal Dutch Shell A shares rose 44p to \u00a318 and BP was 3.3p better at 376.55p. But transport groups fell back on concerns about higher fuel costs, with easyJet down 31p at \u00a314.90. Overall the FTSE 100 ended 16.99 points higher at 6301.52, despite disappointing Chinese trade data. Positive UK economic news in the shape of better than expected industrial production figures and a pick up in GDP forecast by economists at NIESR helped support the market. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: A topsy turvy day for UK stocks has seen initial losses turn to gains for the FTSE as a bullish open for the US pushed the Dow and S&amp;P 500 closer to all-time highs. Rising commodity prices have provided a boost to the FTSE, which has outperformed its European counterparts owing to the disproportionately large number of energy and mining firms in the index. US crude inventories fell once more last week, as the effects of fading US production continues to impact the stockpiles that are slowly coming down to more normal levels. Marks &amp; Spencer added 12p to 375.5p as Morgan Stanley said the demise of BHS should benefit the business, adding 2% to 3% to its like for like sales over the next year. Putting an overweight rating and 460p price target on Marks, analyst Geoff Ruddell said: Last week\u2019s announcement that BHS is to be wound down should ease pressure on its competitors. We expect M&amp;S to be the biggest beneficiary. While it is unlikely to change M&amp;S\u2019s longer-term prospects, it increases our conviction that the nearer-term risk reward is now very favourable. Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling rose 46p to \u00a314.56 in further reaction to Monday\u2019s investor day. Citigroup said: Coca-Cola Hellenic hosted an investor day in London, which focused on mid-term revenue and margin drivers, and brought to focus [its] compelling margin recovery story, which seems to be underappreciated by investors. Management\u2019s confident tone reinforced our view that mid-term fundamentals are improving. Societe Generale said: The company gave an EBIT margin target of 11% by 2020, which is back to its pre-crisis level (10.9% in 2007). There is no consensus available for 2020, but prior to the presentation, we forecast a margin of 9%, and the 2018 Vuma [independent website] consensus margin is 8.3%. So the target is well above where investors currently expect Coca-Cola Hellenic to get its margins. The company\u2019s medium-term organic sales growth target of 4-5% is close to consensus of 4%, so is less controversial. Elsewhere 3i Infrastructure rose 9.5p to 176.5p as the group, which invests in projects such as Cross London Trains and Wireless Infrastructure Group, successfully raised \u00a3385m from new and existing shareholders, \u00a335m more than originally planned. Domino\u2019s Pizza was 31p higher at \u00a310.98 after it paid \u00a324m to buy significant minority interests in a number of the brand\u2019s overseas franchises. The company added that its trading was in line with expectations. Analysts at Peel Hunt said: Domino\u2019s has shown its appetite for acquisitions, with a \u00a324m acquisition in the master franchises in Iceland, Norway and Sweden. The acquisition will give it a significant minority interest and the ability to appoint a director to the board of the three territories. It is a positive announcement and gives the group access to territories with a strong potential in Norway and Sweden. But AO World was down 9.1p at 158p after the online domestic appliance retailer revealed a full year operating loss of \u00a310.6m after investment in European expansion.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Now that the dust has settled from a genuinely gripping session, what have we learned? MPs were presented with two different views of Dominic Chappell, but neither inspired confidence that he should have ever owned BHS. The man himself admitted not paying enough attention to BHS\u2019s pension problems, a mistake that had terrible consequences for the company\u2019s current and former workers. He had no retail experience, and had been planning to use his skills in the property game to generate profits. That gamble didn\u2019t pay off, and BHS\u2019s 11,000 staff are paying the price. And as MPs picked away at the property sales at the heart of the BHS deal, a curious picture slowly emerged about how Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions (RAL) ever looked like a credible bidder. It all centres on an aborted plan to sell Marylebone House, generating a nice profit for RAL, and helping funding the deal. When that sale unravelled, BHS sold another site to the Dellals, and eventually got \u00a310m from Green as compensation. So, a buyer without retail experience and without the funding needed to turn BHS around. We also learned: Chappell admitted he had made a profit from BHS, but refused to reveal how much and claimed he deserved it. Retail Acquisitions took \u00a317m at least from BHS, but Chappell refused to confirm how much went to him personally. Chappell tried to deflect blame on Green, hinting that he might sue, claiming that the Arcadia boss expected him to fail -- and even saying Green sabotaged a rescue bit from Mike Ashley at the last minute. That\u2019s the same Mike Ashley who admitted yesterday that Sports Direct had become too big for him; we can only imagine how he\u2019d have coped with BHS too.... The killer blow may have been the admission that he had to take a \u00a3150,000 personal loan, and has yet to repay half of it. Chappell blamed tax bills, citing profits he made at BHS. Having to deny that you\u2019re heading for another bankruptcy must have stung Chappell. As must defending the \u00a31.5m loan to a company that owned his father\u2019s house. Astonishingly, that is the more flattering picture of Chappell which the former racing driver painted himself. BHS\u2019s former management were scathing -- with one-time finance chief Michael Hitchcock memorably calling Chappell a Premier League class liar with his fingers in the till. Hitchcock also argued that BHS could have been saved with a more competent and financially robust owner; so why did Green sell to Chappell? And Darren Topp, former CEO, had the bombshell moment - claiming that Chappell threatened to kill him after the \u00a31.5m transfer of funds to BHS Sweden was discovered. Chappell insisted this was nonsense. But this transfer is curious, especially as Chappell admitted that BHS Sweden was controlled by one of his directors - not BHS itself. Topp claimed it was simply \u201ctheft\u201d -- although the money has been returned. So, there\u2019s a lot for MPs to digest - and a lot for Philip Green to talk about when he testifies soon. And that\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW ITV\u2019s Joel Hill has tweeted the letter which Sir Philip Green sent in April, calling in his \u00a335m loan, and triggering BHS\u2019s administration. This is what Chappell was referring to earlier, when he said Green had thwarted Sports Direct\u2019s attempts to save BHS: BHS\u2019s former CEO, Darren Topp, was surrounded by reporters and snappers as he left today\u2019s hearing - after his dramatic claims about Dominic Chappell. Despite quizzing Chappell for two hours, the MPs failed to ask the former owner of BHS about the allegation that he threatened to kill CEO Darren Topp. But the British press pack are on the case.... Our own Sarah Butler, and the Telegraph\u2019s Ashley Armstrong, collared Chappell in the media scrum. And Chappell has denied that he made the threat after Topp discovered the \u00a31.5m transfer of funds to BHS Sweden (as the MPs heard this morning) And finally.... the MPs ask Dominic Chappell about what he most regrets, with hindsight. Chappell pauses, and then points to the pension black hole. We should have spend more time looking at the pension issue before the deal, and ensured that Philip Green was contractually committed to helping with trade insurance. Q: And would you like to apologise to anyone? I am very upset that there are 11,000 people directly, and many thousands more indirectly, who have lost their jobs, says Chappell. It is a travesty that it happened. I am very upset that it happened, and it was avoidable. Q: For the record, is that an apology? It is an apology, Chappell confirms. Q: So, are you to blame for the collapse of BHS? Chappell says he is partly responsible: I must stand forward as majority shareholder and say we were part of the downfall of BHS. And that\u2019s the end of the hearing..... Interesting.... Chappell reveals that BHS Sweden was solely owned by one Retail Acquisitions director, Lennard Henningson, when \u00a31.5m was transferred from BHS. Ie:, it wasn\u2019t incorporated into BHS. But that was always supposed to happen, Chappell insists, but RAL hasn\u2019t had time to do it. They were difficult times. Q: What sort of message does it send about capitalism that you were in the Bahamas on the day when BHS went into administration? This is a sideshow, fumes Chappell. He tells MPs that he can show them details of the meetings he had with potential investors who could have saved BHS. The MPs aren\u2019t impressed, saying \u201cCaptains should be on the bridge of the ship, not a yacht.\u201d Chappell says that the administrators, Duffy Phelps, made it clear that we were not allowed back in the building. Q: At last.... the committee ask about the \u00a31.5m which Chappell tried to transfer out of BHS to Sweden (as CEO Darren Topp revealed). Chappell claims he did this to protect funds, as he believes Topp was working to a different agenda. He says the money was needed to pay various fees, such as insurance, and to JP Morgan and KPMG. Q: So why did you put it back? Chappell says he was reassured by Topp, so brought the money back (minus \u00a350,000 in fees which have now been repaid too) Mr Topp is sitting in the gallery, shaking his head, points out Iain Wright MP. Perhaps we should hear from him again before this session ends..... The committee ask for details about various BHS property sales... The gloves are coming off.... Frank Field MP tells Dominic Chappell that his grandmother would call him a \u201cWalter Mitty\u201d character, but one who can get money for himself. That\u2019s very personal, Chappell replies. The MPs now demand more details about the \u00a31.5m loan that Retail Acquisitions gave to the company that owns Chappell\u2019s father\u2019s house. Chappell says that the loan was agreed by RAL\u2019s board \u2013 he voted in favour, although one independent director abstained. It might have been better if YOU had abstained, the committee suggest, then the independent directors could vote on it. Where was the corporate governance? Chappell doesn\u2019t like this line of questioning - claiming that \u00a31.5m is \u201ca sideshow\u201d compared to what BHS is all about. This is not a sideshow, he\u2019s told, as gasps echo around the room. This goes to the heart of what went wrong at BHS. Iain Wright MP asks Chappell about a personal loan of \u00a3150,000 he took out recently, at 1% per month, repayable after two weeks. Only \u00a375,000 has been repaid, and the other half has now been formally demanded (by the Dellal family, who had been involved those complicated property deals) Q: Mr Chappell, are you going bankrupt again? No, says Chappell, giving a vey short laugh (and not looking amused at all). He says that he had a tax bill to pay. Q: But you\u2019ve told us that you\u2019ve made money on BHS. Yes, but when you make a profit, you incur tax, Chappell explains. Q: Did you lend \u00a31.5m from BHS to a property company connected to your father? The loan came from Retail Acquisitions, Chappell says, not BHS, from money generated by the business. It went to a company that owns his father\u2019s house. Dominic Chappell is adamant that he\u2019s not to blame for the deadlock over BHS\u2019s pension black hole. It\u2019s argues that its Philip Green\u2019s fault, for failing to co-operate with the pension regulators. In another dizzying trip down the rabbit hole, Chappell says he wasn\u2019t allowed to speak to the Pensions Regulator about BHS before he had actually bought the company. Dominic Chappell continues to blame Sir Philip Green for BHS\u2019s collapse. He repeats his complaint that the Arcadia boss didn\u2019t deliver on his promise to sort out BHS\u2019s credit insurance (which drove up costs) MPs aren\u2019t impressed... Q: You bought this company, and had a cash crisis within three months of buying the business. Chappell claims it was more like a short-term pinch point - and he sorted out a loan to cover it. Dominic Chappell claims that BHS\u2019s landlords were very hard to deal with, after years of being yelled at by Green. There was a perception that we were Philip\u2019s boys... brought in to take this problem child of Arcadia\u2019s hands, he adds. Boom! Dominic Chappell has told MPs that BHS could have been saved from liquidation, because Mike Ashley of Sports Direct was prepared to step in. Chappell says that Sports Direct was a \u201cwilling buyer\u201d for BHS, if it could have avoided the pension liabilities. We worked for 24-hour straight, says Chappell. \u201cMike would have saved the business\u201d But Green didn\u2019t want the deal to go through, so he called in the administrators by triggering the \u00a335m charge that he still held on BHS. According to Chappell, Sports Direct would have given BHS the capital injection it needed. That would have left Greens\u2019 \u00a335m loan \u201cin the long grass\u201d. But SPD would only do the deal if the pension regulators agreed that Sports Direct would be \u201cfound harmless\u201d for the pension liabilities. The Pension Protection Fund worked almost all night, looking for a solution, but then said he needed more time - and then Green served the notice that forced the administration, Chappell claims. Yesterday, Mike Ashley told the BIS committee that he \u201c100%\u201d wanted to buy BHS, but didn\u2019t reveal what went wrong. Iain Wright, chair of the BIS committee, turns to the money which Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisition took out of BHS. Q: Given BHS needed working capital, why were you taking money out? These were fees that we had incurred in the course of the deal. Q: How much have you taken out? I\u2019ll give you a full outline on a spreadsheet Q: Give us a flavour now, please No. You can have it as soon as practically possible.... Q: So have you made a profit? Yes, I have made a profit, Chappell confirms. But he did work on this business for the last 13 months, incurring substantial fees. So he feels he earned the profit. Q: How do you feel about the 11,000 people who are losing their jobs? Devastated, Chappell replies. He then promises to also give details on how much he received personally. Reminder, you can watch Dominic Chappell\u2019s testimony at the top of this blog. It\u2019s also being streamed here. Here\u2019s a video clip of the jaw-dropping moment this morning, when the CEO of BHS claimed Chappell had threatened to kill him after he spotted a \u00a31.5m transfer out of the company. Chappell talks about the \u201cenormous lack of investment\u201d at BHS during Green\u2019s tenure - saying some stores had no heating. And he blames the rows over BHS\u2019s pension deficit for scuppering his hopes of recruiting a chairman who actually understood retail. On the negotiations with Green, Dominic Chappell says he told the Arcadia boss about his past - including that he had been declared bankrupt in the past (twice, I believe...) Q: Did he know about your lack of retail experience? I was very open, Chappell insists. We know nothing about retail. Q: Do you think Sir Philip Green set you up to fail by selling BHS? Philip genuinely thought we would fail, Chappell claims. He claims that the Arcadia boss was hostile to the property CVA which was agreed this year, which lowered BHS\u2019s rental costs. He also takes a pop at Michael Hitchcock (who called Chappell a premier league liar this morning), claiming the former finance officer didn\u2019t deliver. Hitchcock came in and made a lot of noise that he\u2019d deal with the landlords....He\u2019s a man of many words and very little delivery. The committee insist that Chappell releases documents related to the BHS sale. Frank Field MP isn\u2019t happy that Chappell\u2019s lawyers are claiming that \u2018privilege\u2019 means they can\u2019t answer some questions. Chappell says he is currently looking at whether legal action could be brought against Arcadia/Sir Philip Green. Our insurers have asked that we do not release any documents at this time - it could violate out insurance, he claims. We\u2019ll make documents available once we have decided what to do, he adds. Chappell takes another swipe at Sir Philip Green, saying the Arcadia boss had sold BHS\u2019s Ealing store to a related party - his stepson - and had to issue a clarification to the pensions regulator. I was shocked, Chappell says, and shocked that \u00a33.5m profits that should have gone to BHS went elsewhere. Q: Did you raise it with Green? Yes. He said \u201cthat\u2019s showbusiness,\u201d Chappell replies. Dominic Chappell claims BHS failed for three reasons: 1) \u201cContinuous bashing\u201d from the pension regulators and Sir Philip Green - and the regulators inability to reach a deal with RAL separate to Green 2) Trade credit insurance had gone - Green had already said he\u2019d liquidate BHS if he didn\u2019t find a buyer. If we didn\u2019t buy it, he would have liquidated it for sure 3) Green made a clear pledge that he would provide help with the trade insurance. He didn\u2019t, so we had to find an extra \u00a330m. Good grief. Chappell claims that he only realised the true scale of BHS\u2019s pensions problem after he bought the company (for one shiny pound coin). Oh Dominic, you should have know, sighs the committee - saying it\u2019s a clear failure of due diligence. After probing a few more figures, Jeremy Quin MP has totalled that Chappell only had cash assets of around \u00a325m, not the \u00a394m he claimed. Chappell denies this.... We\u2019ve not heard anything about BHS\u2019s actual day-to-day operations yet: Chappell adds that he received \u00a35m from the Dellal family of property developers (as part of the sale of BHS\u2019s North West House to their ACE company), on top of the \u00a310m from the Green family. That means the \u00a315m that Retail Acquisitions put into BHS didn\u2019t actually come from his own pocket. Jeremy Quin MP is probing how much cash Dominic Chappell actually had when he bought BHS. The official documents also show \u00a394m of cash. That includes \u00a335m in an Olswang account - where did that come from? Chappell explains that it is to do with the plan to buy Marylebone House from Sir Phillip Green, and then sell it to the Dellal family of property developers (as we heard earlier). [Ie, the Dellal\u2019s had loaned him the \u00a335m, expecting to buy Marylebone House once the deal went through]. Chappell claims that Arcadia knew about this - something they denied.... But Green then came back and said he had a better offer, so he\u2019d compensate me.... Q: Quin: The accounts show you expected \u00a38.5m from Green as compensation. Did it show up? It did not, says Chappell, despite being agreed. We eventually received \u00a310m from Green, two months later. Chappell also confirms that a second property, called North West House, was sold to the Dellals. And \u00a37m of that sale was transferred to his Retail Acquisitions company. Q: Why did it leave BHS? Chappell explains that RAL paid \u00a310m into BHS shortly afterwards. He also confirms that \u00a33.5m of this \u00a310m came as a soft loan from Tina Green. That\u2019s Lady Green -- Sir Philip\u2019s wife, who actually owns Arcadia. Dominic Chappell tells the committee that the original plan, discussed with Arcadia, was to buy BHS \u201cdebt free and pension free\u201d. Those talks started in August 2014. But RAL was disabused of that notion in January 2015, and realised that it would have to take on the pension liabilities. Chappell also confirms that Goldman Sachs were Arcadia\u2019s \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 -- he had to persuade GS that he was a credible buyer before he could do any due diligence. Q: Were you the victim of a classic \u2018bait and switch\u2019, asks Conservative MP Jeremy Quin.... Chappell suggests this isn\u2019t the case. Another jab at Sir Phil: Q: Do you think Sir Philip Green is a successful businessman? He\u2019s very successful at getting rich by taking huge sums of money out of companies, Chappell shoots back. [That\u2019s a reference to the \u00a3400m of dividends that BHS paid to the Green family] Chappell\u2019s strategy is pretty clear.... Dominic Chappell blames Sir Philip Green for forcing the closure of BHS. If Philip had assisted us, we could have saved BHS. We were in the process of moving forwards, Chappell claims. He says Green still had a financial claim on BHS (despite having sold it), while the pensions minefield was addressed. Q: Was it a Sword of Damocles? It was a stick that we were continually beaten with, Chappell replies. He also claims that Darren Topp tried to \u2018wiggle his way\u2019 into the ownership of BHS. Remember, Topp claimed this morning that Chappell threatened to kill him, over that \u00a31.5m movement of cash out of the company. Dominic Chappell has taken his seat before MPs to answer (a lot of) questions about the collapse of BHS. Q: How did you meet Sir Philip Green? Chappell explains that he met the Arcadia boss (and former owner of BHS, of course) through a gentleman called Paul Sutton (who is a convicted fraudster). Chappell says Sutton had been working on a deal to buy BHS. And Chappell and his team subsequently began work on the deal -- but found that he didn\u2019t find Sutton credible. We believe Sutton was hood-winking people, Chappell says, making claims about his links to Sir Philip Green which weren\u2019t true. (Eddie Parladorio is one of the Retail Acquisition directors we heard from earlier) Dominic Chappell If you\u2019re just joining us, then hello :) Here\u2019s our news story about the remarkable revelations from the current CEO of failed retail chain BHS, and the former finance chief: The session with Dominic Chappell\u2019s former directors at Retail Acquisitions has ended. Next up, Chappell himself. Committee chairman Iain Wright says it could take a long time.... so calls a brief suspension to proceedings. We reconvene at 11.25am. Frank Field MP asks about BHS\u2019s pension liabilities. Stephen Bourne says that the original proposal that RAL would buy BHS without its pension liabilities was floated before Christmas 2014. He denies that the property deals were a later ruse to boost Chappell\u2019s credibility; why would Sir Philip Green need to build up Chappell\u2019s credibility, to himself? Because it would allow Green to present Chappell as a credible buyer, Field suggests. Stephen Bourne tells MPs that \u201cnothing improper\u201d occurred during the negotiations to buy BHS last year. Dominic Chappell was running around, trying to find the money, talking to Philip Green, while we focused on other aspects of the deal, Bourne says. The MPs are now asking the former Retail Acquisitions (RAL) directors why several \u201cjumped ship\u201d and left RAL at the same time, shortly after the BHS deal One, Stephen Bourne, says he wasn\u2019t comfortable about new directors chosen by Chappell. A second ex-director says he hadn\u2019t planned to stay on after the BHS deal. There\u2019s talk of pressure of work from other responsibilities. The key issue in these complicated property deals is that Dominic Chappell appears to have used the promise of a future profit on Marylebone House to get a loan (from property dynasty ACE), to suggest that he was a serious buyer for BHS, who could have turned the business around. And that property deal would have been signed off by Sir Philip Green, raising questions about how much he knew about Chappell\u2019s actual financial muscle. Amazingly, no-one seems to know who owns Marylebone House today. This --&gt; The MPs are trying, hard, to get to the bottom of an \u00a38.5m payment that Sir Philip Green allegedly promised to pay to Dominic Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions as part of the BHS deal. The former RAL directors aren\u2019t completely clear about what happened, so I\u2019m frankly confused too. But I think the story is that the money \u2013 which would have given Chappell a guaranteed profit on Day One of owning BHS \u2013 didn\u2019t arrive when expected. There were then conversations, culminating in a \u00a310m payment from Arcadia in June 2015. This is instead of the \u00a38.5m profit that Chappell was expecting to make on the aborted property deal involving Marylebone House (see earlier post) Here\u2019s Graham Ruddick\u2019s news story about the remarkable evidence session from BHS\u2019s management this morning: The committee are kicking the tires on one of the property deals, the sale of Marylebone House. It\u2019s devilishly complicated. But Retail Acquisitions (RAL) directors are explaining that Dominic Chappell had planned to buy the property for \u00a335m and then sell it to ACE (the property dynasty who had lent him funds) for \u00a345m, and to receive \u00a38m in return. But Sir Philip Green changed his mind, selling the property to someone else, and promising to compensating RAL instead. Oliver Shah of the Sunday Times (who\u2019s done some great reporting on BHS) has tweeted the key points: Q: So, BHS wasn\u2019t sold for \u00a31, it was sold for minus ten million quid? Apparently it\u2019s not as simple as that.... The committee are now taking evidence from former directors of Retail Acquisitions. They are explaining that Goldman Sachs was the \u201cgatekeeper\u2019 to Sir Philip Green, of the Arcadia Group. That was the end of the session with BHS\u2019s management. These tweets sum things up. Highlights start here. Topp also confirms that Dominic Chappell wasn\u2019t even in the office on the day BHS went into administration. He told staff he was having an eye operation in America; but actually he was on his yacht in the Bahamas. That\u2019s unacceptable, Topp says. Q: Is it true that Dominic Chappell tried to move \u00a31.5m out of BHS to a company called BHS Sweden? That is true, BHS CEO Darren Topp confirms. And Topp\u2019s first response when he discovered the money had moved was to call the police. Topp explains that he phoned Chappell, and told him, \u201cthat\u2019s theft\u201d. And \u2013 \u201cbetween expletives\u201d, apparently \u2013 Chappell told Topp not to kick off about it. If you kick off about it, I\u2019ll come down there and kill you. Apparently Chappell had claimed to be ex-SAS.... Chappell said that the money was to \u201clook after the home team\u201d (ie, his Retail Acquisition colleagues). The next day, a board meeting was called to discuss firing Topp and another director - another lawyer, who explained to Chappell that the transfer was theft. The money was then returned, minus \u00a350,000 for \u201cfees\u201d, but Topp believes the money has all been recovered. Those funds were meant to pay staff, Topp explains. It\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d that it was ever moved. Q: Why wasn\u2019t the turnaround plan delivered? CEO Darren Topp argues that BHS\u2019s sales performance was actually better than Marks &amp; Spencer, but agrees that targets weren\u2019t hit. Michael Hitchcock jumps to Topp\u2019s defence, saying Topp is a good retailer - but obviously performance suffers if you\u2019re spending most of your time trying to tackle a disfunctional owner. And he then lays into Chappell\u2019s Retail Acqusition again: You can\u2019t have the uncle as the chairman, the family\u2019s best friend on the board, and Dominic Chappell on the board of BHS... then you\u2019ve already got a majority of friends and family on the board [breaking best practice]. Back to the pensions issue...... Former CFO Michael Hitchcock says that there were \u201ccredible solutions\u201d to BHS\u2019s pensions deficit on the table, more than once. That could have prevented the fund going into the Pension Protection Fund, meaning pensioners lose some of the benefits. And he put some of the blame on the PPF and and the TPF (The Pensions Faculty). They are cumbersome...not commercial.. and not operating in the best interest of the pensioners. Former BHS CEO Richard Price says he learned on 26 January 2015 that Sir Phillip Green was planning to sell BHS. And Green apparently told them that Chappell\u2019s \u00a31 bid was credible. The committee are focusing on BHS\u2019s pension liabilities. Darren Topp explains that a plan was being drawn up, that would have involved a 7% cut to pension entitlements. It would have included a contribution from Green\u2019s Arcadia Group. But that plan was turned down by the pension regulators, so Arcadia\u2019s contribution was never agreed. Darren Topp admits that he was \u201chonoured\u201d to be asked to run BHS by Chappell in 2015. But he swiftly realised that all wasn\u2019t well, so engaged Michael Hitchcock to cover the role of finance director. Hitchcock clearly found the whole experience quite remarkable. He talks about meetings which were more like tea parties, packed with executives, so nothing could get agreed on the pension liabilities. Hitchock sums it up: It was like a Mexican standoff, everyone was dancing around the handbags... Q: Tell us more about Dominic Chappell\u2019s lies.... If someone stands up in front of you and says they\u2019ve put \u00a310m into the business, and got a property expert to turn things around, and they don\u2019t deliver. That\u2019s lying in my book, says Michael Hitchcock. Q: So how much money did Retail Acquisitions take out? RAL took \u00a317m out of the business, fact. Arguably it put \u00a310m back in, fact, replies Hitchcock. He adds that you could argue that a lot more came out (mentioning a \u00a345m figure) -- but those are the simple facts. No-one wanted BHS to fail, he adds, including Chappell - who presumably wanted to keep using it as a revenue stream for his other operation. Q: Were you aware of Dominic Chappell\u2019s lack of retail experience? CEO Darren Topp explains that it was blatantly obvious. So the BHS board needed to be shaken up, with new directors with solid experience. Chappell kept promising to bring in some heavy-hitters, but... There was always a reason why it didn\u2019t happen. And it never did. Chappell argued that his expertise was in property, and in deals -- to raise the finance that BHS needed, explains Topp. Former CFO Michael Hitchcock then chips in - saying that he believes there was enough value on the BHS balance to raise the funds needed to turn it around, if handled properly. Former CEO Richard Price, who resigned just after BHS was sold for \u00a31, is explaining that the company had struggled despite close attention from Sir Phillip Green. Thus the need for a turnaround plan. Q: So how much fresh capital money did the turnaround plan show was needed? It didn\u2019t, Price explains, as we only had a week to draw it up (before the sale to Chappell) Michael Hitchcock is now explaining that BHS managed to cut \u00a312m in costs once it was split away from Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group (which had supplied various services to BHS). The point being; a turnaround plan could have been possible, under a competent owner. Accountancy group Grant Thornton have some questions to answer - they advised Chappell on this secret plan to split off BHS\u2019s assets..... The committee are now hearing that Dominic Chappell had a secret plan to hive off profitable parts of BHS, rather than engaging with the Company Voluntary Arrangement drawn up to save the company. Q: Is that typical of a company trying to restructure itself? It\u2019s typical about conditions at the time, frowns Michael Hitchcock (who was effectively working as BHS\u2019s finance director). Hitchcock also says that he sniffed out Chappell as a fantasist within two weeks. Another damning assessment from Michael Hitchcock: Michael Hitchcock, former financial advisor to BHS, is being absolutely scathing about Dominic Chappell. Hitchcock is explaining how Chappell\u2019s claims steadily unravelled, calling him: A Premier League liar, and a Sunday Pub League retailer, at best..... Then he adds, sorrowfully: So many people believed him, but he was a liar. Hitchcock then explains that Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions had proposed taking profitable assets out of BHS, at a time when it desperately needed support. Q: Why on earth would you do that? Hitchcock replies: I question his intelligence. He wasn\u2019t a retailer. But he also suggests that the motivation could have been to use BHS has a \u201clifeboat\u201d. The committee are seeking more details about the \u00a37m which Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisition (RA) took from a property deal. They hear that North West House, the property next to BHS\u2019s HQ, was sold for \u00a332m. But only \u00a325m went into BHS, with \u00a37m going to RA in a loan. Darren Topp says he first met Dominic Chappell in February 2015, when the company was looking to develop its turnaround plan. He explains that he met regularly with Sir Phillip Green, and flagged up his concerns about Chappell. Topp is explaining how Chappell took funds out of BHS, rather than putting cash in as promised. That includes a \u00a37m contribution from sales of BHS property, plus a \u00a31.8m payments from the sale in 2015. Darren Topp also explains that it was hard to turn BHS around given the large rent costs. So breaking away from Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Arcadia group could make sense. Q: So how did conditions change after March 2015? Chappell explained that he was a turnaround expert, and had just pulled off a deal at an oil company in Spain. Q: And was that true? Topp explains that Chappell had promised to bring in turnaround experts, and \u00a310m of his own money. But promises didn\u2019t come to fruition. And then Topp sums up how things unravelled: It became clear towards the end that rather than putting money in....he\u2019d got his fingers in the till. The session begins, with MPs taking evidence from Darren Topp, chief executive of BHS, former CEO Richard Price, and Michael Hitchcock, former financial adviser to BHS. Topp begins by explaining that BHS lost money during his seven years at the company. We didn\u2019t respond quick enough, or fast enough to the changing market place, Topp explains. When we were competing with the likes of C&amp;A (the Dutch chain), we did well, but conditions got harder as retail changed. The hearing is underway now. You can watch it live here. DId Dominic Chappell believed he was buying BHS for just \u00a31 without taking on the pension deficit? That seems extraordinary. But that what investment bank RiverRock told MPs yesterday.... Joseph Dryer of River Rock, which advised Chappell prior to his takeover of BHS, said Chappell had given the impression that he had been led to the BHS deal as he knew the Greens and had attended parties on their yacht. Chappell had told his advisers that he had agreed a deal with Green that included the settlement of the pension deficit by the billionaire. When it emerged that no such deal had been agreed and the pension was still to be resolved River Rock resigned. Dryer suggested there had been a break down in relations. As Dryer put it: \u201cAt that point we had been working [with Chappell] over three weeks. Normally when you work with someone you build confidence levels with them. But that wasn\u2019t exactly the case.\u201d MPs need to dig into some property transactions today. Chappell borrowed \u00a335m from the Dellal family, a dynasty of property developers, before the takeover of BHS was conducted. Once the deal was done, the Dellals turned a nice profit on a property deal. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: Allied Commercial Exporters (Ace), which is controlled by father and son Guy and Alexander Dellal, provided \u00a335m to Chappell, allowing him to demonstrate to Arcadia he was a credible businessman. Ace then bought a BHS office building next to its headquarters, called North West House, and sold it for a profit just weeks later. Ace also lent to BHS at such a fierce interest rate that it was known by the retailer\u2019s management as the \u201cWonga\u201d loan. These transactions made millions of pounds for Ace. MPs must try to establish whether the property deals and loans were connected to Ace putting up the \u00a335m. The Labour party want Dominic Chappell to apologise for his role in BHS\u2019s collapse. Angela Eagle MP, shadow secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, says the 11,000 workers facing likely job losses deserve answers. \u201cThe former management of BHS have apologised to staff, blaming Chappell - a former racing driver with virtually no experience of retail - for failing to deliver on his promises. He owes staff an apology too. \u201cBut he might owe more than that. Chappell\u2019s company took millions of pounds out of the business as it veered into administration, leaving a huge pension deficit. He has serious questions to answer.\u201d Nine senior managers at BHS have piled fresh pressure on Dominic Chappell before today\u2019s hearing, by firmly blaming him for the company\u2019s demise. In a letter to BHS staff, they say that Chappell simply failed to deliver the financial support he promised. They write: \u201cWe, the management team of British Home Stores, would like to apologise to you and all our colleagues for the very sad situation we find the business in. \u201cThe inability of RAL [Retail Acquisitions] to raise sufficient funds and dispose of key property assets, hindered the management team in delivering the turnaround plan. \u201cAny sums of financing raised or property disposals appeared to fall short of expectations. Under challenge, Dominic Chappell continuously assured us he would deliver on raising funds, this was not the case.\u201d Something for the MPs to raise this morning.... Good morning. After yesterday\u2019s unforgettable hearing with Mike Ashley, another tarnished businessman is being quizzed at parliament this morning. Dominic Chappell, former owner of BHS, is appearing before MPs, to explain his role in the retailers\u2019 collapse which is costing 11,000 jobs. And he has a lot of explaining to do. How and why did Chappell pick up the chain for \u00a31, how much money was taken out by his Retail Acquisitions during his 13 months in charge, and why he wasn\u2019t able to prevent its collapse last month? And why did he take on a retailer with a pension deficit that has now ballooned to \u00a3571m? The former racing driver has a rather chequered business record \u2013 including a couple of bankruptcies \u2013 and with no obvious expertise to run such a large company. And he\u2019s never appeared before a select committee before, so this session could be seriously interesting. Yesterday, the BIS committee got Mike Ashley to agree that conditions at his firm were unacceptable. Today, they (in partnership with the Work and Pensions committee) need to dig into the complicated financial transactions around this deal, and try to find out how much Chappell benefitted personally. Back in April, the Guardian reported that Retail Acquisitions took \u00a325m out of BHS during their ownership. Chappell, though, insists that he also put \u00a310m into the company, plus a \u00a35m loan secured against BHS\u2019s assets. Where did that money come from? And where did it go?.... The committee will also hear from former top executives at BHS, who will also give crucial insights into Chappell. The session begins at 9am. Here\u2019s the batting order. Witnesses: Darren Topp, Chief Executive, and Richard Price, Former Chief Executive, BHS Witnesses: Mark Tasker, Eddie Parladorio, and Stephen Bourne, Retail Acquisitions Ltd Witnesses: Dominic Chappell Also coming up today.... Financial markets could be edgy, after new data showed Chinese exports fell by over 4% last month. Supermarket chain Sainsbury is reporting results, showing total sales falling 1% in the last three months. Not great, but rather better than feared. Advertising giant WPP is holding its AGM, where shareholders could revolt against the \u00a370m pay deal granted to CEO Sir Martin Sorrell. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "British industrial production grew at the fastest pace in almost four years in April, boosted by the pharmaceuticals and energy sectors. The official figures, which took the City by surprise and sent the pound higher, are in contrast with other economic data that has pointed to a slowdown in the economy before the EU referendum on 23 June. Manufacturing output grew by 2.3% in April from the previous month, while the wider measure of industrial production, which also includes mining, oil and gas, posted a 2% rise. Both were the biggest increases since July 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists had expected flat readings. Pharmaceuticals output jumped 8.6%, the biggest monthly rise since February 2014, with evidence of large export orders in the industry. Gas and electricity output rose 3.9% due to unusually cold weather, the ONS said. Both sectors are volatile. Virginia Acha, the executive director responsible for research, medical and innovation at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: \u201cAfter a period of general decline, today\u2019s figures are the first sign of a welcome resurgence for UK medicines manufacturing and are an optimistic bellwether for the health and wealth of the UK economy.\u201d In the three months to April, industrial output rose by 0.7%, the first increase this year. Zach Witton, the deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cWhilst the size of the gain is surprising it generally fits with the picture that the worst may now be behind the sector. It also backs up the feeling that there are no concrete signs that uncertainty associated with the upcoming referendum has had a major impact on manufacturing.\u201d The Bank of England has warned that economic figures are likely to be volatile and tricky to interpret in the run-up to the referendum. Sounding a more pessimistic note, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the jump in manufacturing output was likely to unwind over the coming months, noting that pharmaceutical products were volatile. \u201cIn addition, other categories of production likely were boosted by the recent weakness of the pound. Manufacturers will be hit by a rising pound after a remain vote, or lower business investment after Brexit. With surveys of manufacturers continuing to point to falling production, it\u2019s simply too soon to conclude that April\u2019s data mark a turning point in the industrial sector\u2019s decline.\u201d Manufacturing accounts for about a tenth of the economy and remains 6.4% below its pre-financial crisis peak. The wider economy slowed in the first quarter to 0.4% GDP growth, compared with 0.6% in the final quarter of 2015. Business surveys published this week suggest economic growth could slow further to just 0.2% between April and June. Alan Clarke, at Scotiabank, said: \u201cWhatever the cause, this release gives us some hope that second-quarter GDP will not be the washout that the surveys had made us fearful of. Presumably there will be some payback next month. Nonetheless, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for the industrial sector to add as much as a quarter percentage point to headline GDP, offsetting weakness elsewhere.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>British industrial production grew at the fastest pace in almost four years in April, boosted by the pharmaceuticals and energy sectors.</p> <p>The official figures, which took the City by surprise and sent the pound higher, are in contrast with other economic data that has pointed to a slowdown in the economy before the EU referendum on 23 June.</p> <p>Manufacturing output grew by 2.3% in April from the previous month, while the wider measure of industrial production, which also includes mining, oil and gas, posted a 2% rise. Both were the biggest increases since July 2012, <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/output/bulletins/indexofproduction/april2016\">according to the Office for National Statistics</a>. City economists had expected flat readings.</p> <p>Pharmaceuticals output jumped 8.6%, the biggest monthly rise since February 2014, with evidence of large export orders in the industry. Gas and electricity output rose 3.9% due to unusually cold weather, the ONS said. Both sectors are volatile.</p> <p>Virginia Acha, the executive director responsible for research, medical and innovation at the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: \u201cAfter a period of general decline, today\u2019s figures are the first sign of a welcome resurgence for UK medicines manufacturing and are an optimistic bellwether for the health and wealth of the UK economy.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2016/jun/08/why-upbeat-uk-manufacturing-figures-have-silenced-osborne-increase-production-eu\">Why upbeat UK manufacturing figures have silenced Osborne</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the three months to April, industrial output rose by 0.7%, the first increase this year.</p> <p>Zach Witton, the deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cWhilst the size of the gain is surprising it generally fits with the picture that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/06/uk-manufacturing-could-recover-after-referendum-eef-says\">worst may now be behind the sector</a>. It also backs up the feeling that there are no concrete signs that uncertainty associated with the upcoming referendum has had a major impact on manufacturing.\u201d</p> <p>The Bank of England has warned that economic figures are likely to be volatile and tricky to interpret in the run-up to the referendum.</p> <p>Sounding a more pessimistic note, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the jump in manufacturing output was likely to unwind over the coming months, noting that pharmaceutical products were volatile.</p> <p>\u201cIn addition, other categories of production likely were boosted by the recent weakness of the pound. Manufacturers will be hit by a rising pound after a remain vote, or lower business investment after Brexit. With surveys of manufacturers continuing to point to falling production, it\u2019s simply too soon to conclude that April\u2019s data mark a turning point in the industrial sector\u2019s decline.\u201d</p> <p>Manufacturing accounts for about a tenth of the economy and remains 6.4% below its pre-financial crisis peak. The wider economy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/27/uk-gdp-growth-slows-to-04-amid-eu-referendum-uncertainty\">slowed in the first quarter to 0.4% GDP growth</a>, compared with 0.6% in the final quarter of 2015. Business surveys published this week suggest economic growth could slow further to just 0.2% between April and June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"673223c070aafd59df3f43c6b0a321e37f79f9a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/673223c070aafd59df3f43c6b0a321e37f79f9a1/0_0_735_533/500.jpg\" alt=\"Industrial production\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Industrial production.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alan Clarke, at Scotiabank, said: \u201cWhatever the cause, this release gives us some hope that second-quarter GDP will not be the washout that the surveys had made us fearful of. Presumably there will be some payback next month. Nonetheless, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for the industrial sector to add as much as a quarter percentage point to headline GDP, offsetting weakness elsewhere.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the morning of their wedding, Omar and Betty shared a breakfast of egg McMuffins at a small McDonald\u2019s table, dressed in their finest clothes. Before driving to a Houston courthouse to be married, they walked into the attached child\u2019s play area and joked about one day bringing their kids there. Few understand celebrating at a McDonald\u2019s, but for Omar and Betty it made sense. They don\u2019t have a lot of money, and McDonald\u2019s is part of their life. It is that way in many poor and middle-income neighborhoods, where McDonald\u2019s have become de-facto community centers and reflections of the surrounding neighborhood. When many lower-income Americans are feeling isolated by the deadening uniformity of things, by the emptiness of many jobs, by the media, they still yearn for physical social networks. They are not doing this by going to government-run community service centers. They are not always doing this by utilizing the endless array of well-intentioned not-for-profit outreach programs. They are doing this on their own, organically across the country, in McDonald\u2019s. Walk into any McDonald\u2019s in the morning and you will find a group of mostly retired people clustering in a corner, drinking coffee, eating and talking. They are drawn to the McDonald\u2019s because it has inexpensive good coffee, clean bathrooms, space to sprawl. Unlike community centers, it is also free of bureaucracy. Almost all of them name their group with variations of a self-deprecating theme: in suburban El Paso it is the Old Folks\u2019 Home, and in rural New Mexico it is the Morning Brigade. In the small rural town of Natchitoches, Louisiana, it is the Romeo club, an acronym for Retired Old Men Eating Out. The Natchitoches group, like many of them, sprawls across a corner of the McDonald\u2019s, taking over more and more tables as people join, and emptying them as they leave. Everyone who comes knows each other; have for many years, some since childhood. Willard Jones, 93, tries to make it a few days a week. \u201cI love McDonald\u2019s. People are so nice. My friends come here. I see everybody. Coffee is good, and cheap.\u201d He was born and raised here. \u201cI had it real rough growing up, because times were real rough. Lived on a plantation, modern day slavery. When I was a kid, we used to get a special treat a few times a year, and go eat in town. That place was dirty and cost us a lot. Not like McDonald\u2019s. It is clean here.\u201d These morning groups reflect America in another way: they are almost all segregated. There are all black groups, all white groups, and all Hispanic groups. Rarely are any mixed. The Natchitoches group is the exception. Mostly African Americans, there are a few white men who come and go. In Natchitoches, the Romeo group isn\u2019t the only social event at the McDonald\u2019s. On Tuesdays, there is a bingo game. On weekends, a Bible group sets up in the opposite corner, and offers prayers and Bibles to whoever wants to come. It is run by Stephen Elliott, 63.\u201cWe come here every Saturday, and set up in this corner. The McDonald\u2019s offers us room for whoever shows up. We have the space to gather and pray.\u201d In other McDonald\u2019s, politics are central. In one near downtown Kansas City in an African American neighborhood, each Friday morning the sitting area is turned over to a community meeting. When I was there, the topic was the politics surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement. The discussion was often loud, with speakers not hiding their frustration. Against the backdrop of raised voices, the registers and drive-through continued with the normal morning rush of coffee and egg sandwiches. It isn\u2019t just groups who use McDonald\u2019s. For many of the poorest, for the homeless, and for people caught in an addiction, McDonald\u2019s are an integral part of their lives. They have cheap and filling food, they have free Wi-Fi, outlets to charge phones, and clean bathrooms. McDonald\u2019s is also generally gracious about letting people sit quietly for long periods \u2013 longer than other fast-food places. In Natchitoches, Betty Ryder arrives at the McDonald\u2019s every day around 9am, with her book and packs of cigarettes, and smelling of perfume. She buys a cup of coffee, puts in exactly six sugars, and sits at her favorite table. \u201cI have had a very rough life. Been through a lot. My present situation leaves me without a home between 8am and 7pm, and McDonald\u2019s is kind enough to allow me to sit here.\u201d She is matter-of-fact about what that rough life includes, mentioning a child who died of Aids, and her own tendency to get caught shoplifting. One morning, Pamela Elaine, 58, and Jonathan, 31, are sitting in the booth behind Betty\u2019s. Jonathan had spent the previous night in a detention center for a \u201cminor altercation\u201d. Released early in the morning, he was walking into town when Pamela offered him a ride and a meal at the McDonald\u2019s. Jonathan sits quietly as Pamela tells him the services her ministry offers, and her own story of redemption from addiction through the Bible. \u201cI never have felt comfortable in my own skin. Never felt wanted, so I did cocaine and weed and other things. That is all behind me now, and I am rich in the Lord.\u201d When she asks Jonathan what his problems are, he smiles, then laughs. \u201cWhat troubles do I have? Simple: women!\u201d Betty, walking by from a smoke break outdoors, listens, and laughs. \u201cWell, we are kind of the same. My problem is men, although those men will probably all tell you it is women.\u201d In almost every franchise, there are tables with people like Betty escaping from the streets for a short bit. They prefer McDonald\u2019s to shelters and to non-profits, because McDonald\u2019s are safer, provide more freedom, and most importantly, the chance to be social, restoring a small amount of normalcy. In the Bronx, many of my friends who live on the streets are regulars. Steve, who has been homeless for 20 years, uses the internet to check up on sports, find discarded papers to do the crossword puzzle, and generally escape for a while. He and his wife Takeesha will turn a McDonald\u2019s meal into an evening out. Beauty, who has been homeless for five years, uses the internet to check up on her family back in Oklahoma when she can find a computer to borrow. Most importantly though, McDonald\u2019s provide many with the chance to make real and valuable connections. When faced with the greatest challenges, with a personal loss, wealthier Americans turn to expensive therapists, others without the resources or the availability, turn to each other. In Sulfur Springs, Texas, in the late morning, Lew Mannon, 76, and Gerald Pinkham, 78, were sitting alone at a table, the last of the morning regulars to leave. She was needling him about politics. (\u201cI like to tease the men who come, get them all riled up, tell them they just don\u2019t want a female as president.\u201d) Both are retired, Gerald from working for an airfreight company, and Lew after 28 years as a bank teller. When I asked Lew about her life, she started to tear up, stopped for a second, and composed herself. \u201cLife is hard. Very hard. Seven years ago I lost my husband to leukemia. Then three years ago I lost one of my sons. Health complications from diabetes. When my son died, I had nobody to help me, emotionally, except this community here. Gerald lost his wife three years ago, and we have helped support each other through that.\u201d She stopped again, unable to speak from tears. After a moment of silence: \u201cI look composed on the outside. Many of us do. But I struggle a lot on the inside. This community here gives me the support to get by.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of BHS has claimed Dominic Chappell threatened to kill him after he confronted the former owner of the company about \u00a31.5m being moved out of the business. Darren Topp told MPs that he accused Chappell of theft after discovering that \u00a31.5m had been moved from the company to an entity called BHS Sweden, which was not part of BHS. Topp said he considered calling the police. Chappell responded by threatening to kill him, according to Topp, who said the BHS owner had claimed he was \u201cex-SAS\u201d, and owned a gun. In his own evidence to MPs, Chappell claimed that Sir Philip Green had pushed BHS into administration after going \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out that the retailer was in talks with Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct about a rescue deal. Chappell also claimed that Green \u201cgenuinely believed\u201d that his consortium, Retail Acquisition, would fail in its attempt to save BHS. He added that he was considering legal action against the tycoon and his retail business, Arcadia. The main allegations from the hearing are: Chappell admitted he had made a profit from BHS, but refused to reveal how much and claimed he deserved it. The \u00a315m of \u201cequity\u201d that Retail Acquisitions put into BHS came from a \u00a35m loan from Ace, a property company, and \u00a310m from Green. Retail Acquisitions took \u00a317m at least from BHS, but Chappell refused to confirm how much went to him personally. Chappell was accused of being a \u201cPremier League liar\u201d and having his \u201cfingers in the till\u201d at BHS by its senior managers. Green went \u201cinsane\u201d when he found out that BHS was in talks with Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct about a rescue deal, and pushed company into administration. Green \u201cgenuinely believed\u201d that Retail Acquisitions would fail to turnaround BHS, Chappell claimed. Chappell is considering legal action against Green and Arcadia. Chappell says he \u201cfirmly believes\u201d Green is to blame for the failure of BHS and says the company has been \u201cheld to ransom\u201d by the billionaire and the Pensions Regulator. Topp said Chappell\u2019s movement of the \u00a31.5m, which took place just days before administrators were called in, was \u201cdisgusting\u201d. The \u00a31.5m was eventually repaid to BHS after the board of the company called for Chappell to give it back. Topp alleged Retail Acquisitions took \u00a31.8m from the sale of the company and also \u00a37m from the \u00a332m sale of BHS\u2019s offices at North West House in Marylebone, north London, in March 2015. Michael Hitchcock, a former finance consultant at BHS, also claimed that Chappell had been working on a plan to take the online and international businesses out of the company and put them under Retail Acquisitions. Hitchcock said that Grant Thornton advised Chappell on the plan, called Project Herald, and was then paid more than \u00a3300,000 for its work by BHS. He accused Chappell of being a \u201cmythomaniac\u201d and a \u201cPremier League liar and a Sunday league retailer\u201d. He said events at BHS had been \u201ccompletely extraordinary\u201d and just \u201cdid not smell right\u201d. Hitchcock also said it was \u201cfact\u201d that Retail Acquisitions had taken \u00a317m from BHS, putting in only \u00a310m. The Guardian reported in April that Retail Acquisitions received payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS during its 13-month ownership of the retailer. Chappell\u2019s consortium bought BHS for \u00a31 in March 2015 from Arcadia. Green had controlled BHS for 15 years, during which time the tycoon and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments. BHS is being wound down, with 11,000 jobs at risk, after administrators failed to find a buyer for the company and its 163 shops. MPs on the work and pensions committee and business, innovation and skills committee are investigating the collapse of the company.",

The figures from UK industry were better \u2013 a lot better \u2013 than the City had been expecting and showed the fastest month-on-month increase in almost four years. So where was the instant statement from the chancellor praising the strength of the economy and the success of the government\u2019s strategy? Sherlock Holmes would have had the answer. Osborne\u2019s unusual reticence was a classic case of the dog that doesn\u2019t bark. Put simply, good economic news doesn\u2019t really suit the chancellor at the present juncture. His narrative is that the risk of Britain leaving the European Union has left the economy trembling on the edge of the precipice and for that story to stick he needs signs that consumers and businesses are taking fright at the risk of Brexit. Unfortunately for Osborne, the recent data is not at all helpful. Better weather brought consumers out in their droves in May, according to the British Retail Consortium. Now the Office for National Statistics has reported that industrial production was up by 2% between March and April at a time when the markets had expected output to be flat. To be sure, there are reasons to be a bit cautious about the ONS data. Monthly figures tend to be choppy. Cold weather in April boosted energy demand and there was a sharp jump in production of drugs, a notoriously volatile sector of manufacturing. The quarterly increase in production of 0.7% was less impressive than the monthly increase. Even so, there was a positive story to be told. As Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, put it: \u201cWhile the size of the gain is surprising it generally fits with the picture that the worst may now be behind the sector. It also backs up the feeling that there are no concrete signs that uncertainty associated with the upcoming referendum has had a major impact on manufacturing.\u201d Industry has had a really tough time in recent years. Production is still almost 10% below where it was when the great recession began in early 2008. Upbeat news has been thin on the ground, yet when some arrives it seems the chancellor would prefer to ignore it. Truly, these are curious times we live in.",

      "bodyText": "AO World, the online electrical retailer, plans to start selling computers this year, as it made an operating loss after investment in its European business. It reported full year operating losses of \u00a310.6m after trading losses in Germany and start-up costs in other European countries. But EBITDA moved from \u00a316.5m to \u00a317.2m. The company said it expected European losses of between \u20ac26m and \u20ac30m for the current year, but overall revenues were expected to be ahead of expectations, and trading in the new financial year had started well. On the computing move, chief executive John Roberts said: You\u2019ll see us take a different approach to the traditional \u2018feature-led\u2019 way of selling this category, to the benefit of all customers. Computing is a natural extension of our current categories and there is good potential for cross-selling to our existing customer base, making it an exciting opportunity for the business. The news has seen AO\u2019s share fall 1.6% to 164.4p, but analysts were still positive. David Reynolds at Jefferies said: A good set of results to finish the year, very pleased with the format of the 2017 guide. A revenue range and EBITDA positioning. Something for the bulls and the bears. Reduced revenues in Europe as the company focuses on operational efficiencies. But what falls out is an in-line or slightly improved adjusted EBITDA for the group, along with a solid cash position, bolstered with the \u00a330m RCF, and the launch of computing in the UK and floor care in [Germany]. [The] key risk continues to be operational execution. At Numis, Andrew Wade said: AO has reported full year results consistent with its March update, including UK EBITDA up 31% in the second half, and given clear guidance for 2017. As a result, we raise our 2017 UK EBITDA forecast by 13% but, with the group choosing to slow growth while it builds product margin and capacity, lower our estimates for Europe. We retain our positive stance, confident that AO\u2019s leading customer proposition can support long term profitable growth in the UK and internationally.",

      "body": "<p><strong>AO World</strong>, the online electrical retailer, plans to start selling computers this year, as it made an operating loss after investment in its European business.</p> <p>It reported full year operating losses of \u00a310.6m after trading losses in Germany and start-up costs in other European countries. But EBITDA moved from \u00a316.5m to \u00a317.2m. </p> <p>The company said it expected European losses of between \u20ac26m and \u20ac30m for the current year, but overall revenues were expected to be ahead of expectations, and trading in the new financial year had started well. On the computing move, chief executive John Roberts said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You\u2019ll see us take a different approach to the traditional \u2018feature-led\u2019 way of selling this category, to the benefit of all customers. Computing is a natural extension of our current categories and there is good potential for cross-selling to our existing customer base, making it an exciting opportunity for the business. </p> </blockquote> <p>The news has seen AO\u2019s share fall 1.6% to 164.4p, but analysts were still positive. David Reynolds at Jefferies said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A good set of results to finish the year, very pleased with the format of the 2017 guide. A revenue range and EBITDA positioning. Something for the bulls and the bears. Reduced revenues in Europe as the company focuses on operational efficiencies. But what falls out is an in-line or slightly improved adjusted EBITDA for the group, along with a solid cash position, bolstered with the \u00a330m RCF, and the launch of computing in the UK and floor care in [Germany].</p> </blockquote> <p><br>[The] key risk continues to be operational execution.</p> <p>At Numis, Andrew Wade said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>AO has reported full year results consistent with its March update, including UK EBITDA up 31% in the second half, and given clear guidance for 2017. As a result, we raise our 2017 UK EBITDA forecast by 13% but, with the group choosing to slow growth while it builds product margin and capacity, lower our estimates for Europe. We retain our positive stance, confident that AO\u2019s leading customer proposition can support long term profitable growth in the UK and internationally. </p> </blockquote>",

Financial shares are among the fallers following lower than expected quarterly earnings from US payments technology group Verifone. The news has sent Worldpay down 4.8p to 275.6p, while banks are under pressure with Royal Bank of Scotland 4.5p lower at 225.2p and Barclays falling 2.25p to 178p. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 7.42 points at 6277.11, despite better than expected UK manufacturing and industrial production figures. Mining shares are edging higher despite weak Chinese trade data, with Glencore up 3.05p at 143.05p and Anglo American adding 11.7p to 677.2p. Commodity companies are also benefiting from another rise in oil prices. Brent crude is up 0.12% at $51.5, helped by a weaker dollar, a larger than expected fall in US inventories and worries about militant attacks on pipelines in Nigeria. So Royal Dutch Shell B shares are up 28p at 1792.5p but travel companies are lower on concerns about dearer fuel costs. British Airways owner International Airlines has dipped 0.5p to 521p and easyJet is down 16p at \u00a315.05. Sainsbury has reversed earlier gains following its latest update and is now down 3.4p at 243.3p, while WH Smith has lost 53p to \u00a316.87 after reporting flat like for like sales in the 14 weeks to the start of June. Analysts at Investec said: Another robust trading performance from WH Smith with the the third quarter update (14 weeks to 4 June) in line with expectations. Travel has good momentum ahead of its key summer trading period and High Street continues to be tightly managed. No change to forecasts expected. Despite strong, defensive cash generation, we see valuation (2017 estimated PE 16.3 times) up with short-term earnings momentum and it is difficult to see material upside from here without M&amp;A activity within Travel. We maintain our hold recommendation. But Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling is 28p better at \u00a314.38 after Credit Suisse recently raised its target price from \u00a314.80 to \u00a315 after what the bank called an upbeat investor day.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has reported a slide in sales in the last three months, as it cut back on promotions, and warned that the market remained tough. Like-for-like sales excluding fuel fell 0.8% in the three months to 4 June, the company\u2019s first quarter, following 0.1% growth in the previous quarter. But the drop was not as bad as the 1.4% decline expected by analysts. Total retail sales were up 0.3% excluding fuel. Chief executive Mike Coupe said: \u201cMarket conditions remain challenging. Food price deflation continues to impact our sales and pressures on pricing mean the market will remain competitive for the foreseeable future.\u201d He said deflation \u2013 a period of falling prices \u2013 would continue into the autumn, but it has been easing. He said the grocer had been affected by the different timing of Easter and the May bank holiday compared with last year, and the \u201crelatively inclement April versus a relatively nice April last year\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are not chasing volume for the sake of chasing volume. There\u2019s no doubt that there is a lot of vouchering going on in the marketplace.\u201d The supermarket price war in recent years has seen the big four trying to defend their market share against the German discount chains Aldi and Lidl, as well as new competitors such as Amazon, which recently launched a food delivery service in the UK. Sainsbury\u2019s, Britain\u2019s second-biggest grocer after Tesco, has been cutting back on promotions and is reinvesting \u201cevery penny\u201d saved in lowering regular prices of everyday products such as cheese, vegetables and chicken. It scrapped Brand Match in late April \u2013 under which it gave vouchers to shoppers if they could have bought branded goods cheaper at Asda \u2013 and is phasing out most of its multi-buy promotions by August. Coupe said customers preferred simplicity and clarity \u2013 and \u201cdon\u2019t want a maths degree to go shopping.\u201d Less than a quarter (23%) of Sainsbury\u2019s sales are now on promotion, compared with a mid-30% number for the rest of the market. Chief financial officer John Rogers said fewer promotions meant less volatility in the supply chain, and less food waste. The Competition and Markets Authority is scrutinising the company\u2019s \u00a31.4bn deal to buy Argos owner Home Retail, which was agreed in April. Coupe said he saw no reason to believe that the investigation would go beyond a preliminary probe of 40 working days. Sainsbury\u2019s expects the deal, which will allow it to diversify away from food, to be completed in the third quarter. The trading update showed that clothing sales grew by nearly 5%. Sainsbury\u2019s football-inspired Admiral menswear range is proving popular ahead of the Euro 2016 football tournament that starts on Friday. But Coupe said good weather over the summer was more important than the event. Online sales rose more than 8%, broadly in line with previous growth, after Sainsbury\u2019s launched a new online app. General merchandise grew by more than 5%. In March, Sainsbury\u2019s started selling vinyl records again after 25 years and claims to be the biggest vinyl retailer on the high street, with a near 10% market share. Coupe joked that vinyl had taken over from adult colouring as the latest craze. Rumours by Fleetwood Mac along with David Bowie, Beatles and Nirvana albums are among the top sellers. David Alexander, senior analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, said: \u201cMike Coupe\u2019s claim that Sainsbury\u2019s continues to outperform its major peers begins to look a little dubious \u2026 Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco have adopted similar approaches in their fightback, reducing complex promotional activity in favour of more stable low prices, aligning themselves closely with values that portray a more caring image, such as reducing waste and improving instore service standards.\u201d But, he added: \u201cThe development of its convenience network ... has left Sainsbury\u2019s in a position of strength, while its reputation for the quality of its products should allow it to hold its own as the Tesco fightback continues in earnest.\u201d",
