      "bodyText": "European finance ministers are piling the pressure on Greece to come good on pledges to slash public spending to the bone before closing a deal on a new \u20ac130bn (\u00a3109bn) bailout \u2013 even as the prospect of a disastrous default looms closer. Following weeks of brinkmanship that have poisoned relations between the bankrupt country and its eurozone creditors, ministers and senior officials from the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank, the European commission and the International Monetary Fund have been wrangling over whether to activate the bailout, which would prevent an outright insolvency at the end of March, when Greece has to redeem more than \u20ac14bn in debt. Despite announcements in Athens and Frankfurt that Greece's government had yielded to savage new terms from the eurozone to qualify for the bailout, it was unclear whether the complex new rescue package would be finalised at the parties' meeting in Brussels. The emphasis, though, was on first getting Greece to deliver its side of the bargain. \"It's up to the Greek government, by concrete actions through legislation and other actions, to convince its European partners that the second [bailout] programme can be made to work,\" said Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for monetary affairs. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, played down expectations of any breakthrough on the bailout, which was originally formulated by EU leaders last October. \"I don't think we'll come to any results tonight. The negotiations have made progress but we're not there yet,\" he said. That was echoed by the president of the Eurogroup, Jean-Claude Juncker: \"I don't think we will have a definitive and final decision tonight,\" the leader of the group of eurozone finance ministers said. Greece's finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, was insistent that the bailout be concluded, but ran into strong reservations from Germany. \"We finally have a staff-level agreement for a new, strong and credible programme,\" said Venizelos. \"We also have a deal with the private creditors on the basic parameters. We now need the political endorsement of the Eurogroup for the final step.\" But, amid a mounting sense of crisis, it is possible that any deal that might be struck may prove inadequate. With unemployment soaring, revenue sources drying up, recession deepening and social unrest increasing, there is palpable pessimism and resentment on both sides. In Greece, the idea is growing that austerity cannot work, and that default is more of a question of \"when\", not \"if\". \"Just because Greek leaders have agreed on targets does not mean that they will or indeed can be delivered,\" said Sony Kapoor of Re-Define, an economics thinktank in Brussels. \"We have just reached a temporary truce. The war will continue to be fought for some time to come.\" European commission sources said a signed memorandum committing the Greek government to a further \u20ac3.3bn in savings \u2013 which still has to go through parliament in Athens this weekend \u2013 had to be delivered within five days to meet the tight deadlines for avoiding default. Following a gruelling month of wrangling and number-crunching in Athens and final negotiations with the Greeks that ran until early on Thursday morning, officials from the \"troika\" of the European commission, the ECB, and the IMF departed for Brussels, leaving behind a country pledging to slash 15,000 public sector jobs this year and 150,000 within three years, cut the minimum wage by 20%, and reduce pensions. The troika believes that the euro in Greece is overvalued by up to 20%, meaning that labour costs need to be further reduced if any level of competitiveness and productivity is to be achieved. In return for the pledges, Greece will get the \u20ac130bn, on top of the \u20ac110bn decided nearly two years ago. Greece's private creditors will take up to 70% losses on their loans to Greece through a debt-swap accord that would halve Athens's private sector borrowings to \u20ac100bn. Negotiations resumed in Paris on Thursday on the \"haircuts\" for Greece's private lenders. The pan-European regulator, the European Banking Authority, admitted on Thursday that it had yet to complete a detailed analysis of the plans submitted by the European banks that were found to need to raise \u20ac115bn in last year's stress tests. However, they will not be subjected to new stress tests in 2012 while they cover the already identified shortfalls. If a deal is struck on the new bailout, the IMF will need to confirm that the arrangement will eventually render Greek debt levels sustainable \u2013 the yardstick being that debt falls to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020, from 160% currently. Despite the political pessimism, the markets responded positively to the signals that Greece would be thrown a new lifeline. European stocks rose and the euro neared a two-month high against the dollar. \"There is clearly some very encouraging news coming out of Athens,\" said Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF. \"It's positive.\"",

Negotiations resumed in Paris on Thursday on the \"haircuts\" for Greece's private lenders.</p> <p>The pan-European regulator, the European Banking Authority, admitted on Thursday that it had yet to complete a detailed analysis of the plans submitted by the European banks that were found to need to raise \u20ac115bn in last year's stress tests. However, they will not be subjected to new stress tests in 2012 while they cover the already identified shortfalls.</p> <p>If a deal is struck on the new bailout, the IMF will need to confirm that the arrangement will eventually render Greek debt levels sustainable \u2013 the yardstick being that debt falls to 120% of gross domestic product by 2020, from 160% currently.</p> <p>Despite the political pessimism, the markets responded positively to the signals that Greece would be thrown a new lifeline. European stocks rose and the euro neared a two-month high against the dollar.</p> <p>\"There is clearly some very encouraging news coming out of Athens,\"</p> <p>said Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF. \"It's positive.\"</p>",

The miner is still counting its losses on the deal, with today's $9bn impairment charge making $18bn in total. Not many chiefs of FTSE 100 companies would have survived that. Indeed, the real cost of Rio's adventure in aluminium goes beyond the $18bn writedown. Its previously pristine balance sheet was so stretched that, after the collapse in commodity prices in 2008, emergency action was required to reduce a $40bn debt mountain. A highly dilutive $15bn rights issue was summoned in 2009 once Rio's board had accepted that a fundraising involving state-owned Chinalco of China was too embarrassing to be allowed to fly. The corporate trauma, and the threat to Albanese's career, passed, thanks in large part to the astonishing post-2009 rebound in the price of iron ore, which these days can be dug out of the Western Australian desert for $40 a tonne, shipped to China for $10 a tonne, and sold to local steelmakers for $145 a tonne. Rio, whose assets are heavily skewed towards iron ore, is now spitting out cash at a rate of $1bn a fortnight and its underlying earnings last year (ie, ignoring the Alcan charge) rose 11% to $15.5bn. A rising share price \u2013 up fourfold, if you caught the bottom \u2013 has made everybody feel better.

      "body": "<p><strong>Tate and Lyle</strong> led the FTSE 100 fallers after a disappointing trading update which pointed to higher than expected debt levels.</p> <p>The maker of Splenda sweetener said operating profit in the third quarter was in line with expectations but the rate of volume growth was lower than in the first half. Rising corn prices meant that net debt at the end of March this year would be higher than the \u00a3464m recorded in the previous year. In a sell note Martin Deboo at Investec Securities said:</p> <blockquote> The moving parts seem to be pretty much as we anticipated and Tate remains on a steady course. But we sense some caution from management relative to our expectation that there was room for 2012/13 consensus upgrades. <br> Tate have elected to keep their corn silos full in the face of tight supply. Given rising corn prices, this is likely to drive year end net debt up towards the \u00a3500m level, relative to consensus of \u00a3473m and our \u00a3481m. The impact on earnings in 2012 should be de minimis, but we have some concerns that consensus expectations of net debt in 2013, at \u00a3325m, are too low (we are on \u00a3439m). This is more material. </blockquote> <p>In the event the market was nervous, and Tate's shares ended 22.5p lower at 672.5p.</p> <p>In a big day for company results - and the eurozone debt crisis and economic front - the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> was neither shaken nor stirred. The index closed 19.54 points higher at 5895.47, as the Bank of England unveiled \u00a350bn more quantitative easing and Greece declared a deal had been reached on its austerity package.

      "bodyText": "Tate and Lyle led the FTSE 100 fallers after a disappointing trading update which pointed to higher than expected debt levels. The maker of Splenda sweetener said operating profit in the third quarter was in line with expectations but the rate of volume growth was lower than in the first half. Rising corn prices meant that net debt at the end of March this year would be higher than the \u00a3464m recorded in the previous year. In a sell note Martin Deboo at Investec Securities said: The moving parts seem to be pretty much as we anticipated and Tate remains on a steady course. But we sense some caution from management relative to our expectation that there was room for 2012/13 consensus upgrades. Tate have elected to keep their corn silos full in the face of tight supply. Given rising corn prices, this is likely to drive year end net debt up towards the \u00a3500m level, relative to consensus of \u00a3473m and our \u00a3481m. The impact on earnings in 2012 should be de minimis, but we have some concerns that consensus expectations of net debt in 2013, at \u00a3325m, are too low (we are on \u00a3439m). This is more material. In the event the market was nervous, and Tate's shares ended 22.5p lower at 672.5p. In a big day for company results - and the eurozone debt crisis and economic front - the FTSE 100 was neither shaken nor stirred. The index closed 19.54 points higher at 5895.47, as the Bank of England unveiled \u00a350bn more quantitative easing and Greece declared a deal had been reached on its austerity package. Investors clearly felt we had been here before, but this time the deal could finally have been done. Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, said: There's no question that today's rally was a tentative one and indicates there's still a degree of caution amongst investors.

That was the subtext to the Bank of England's announcement on Thursday that it needed to conjure up a bit more money creation to steer the economy away from the rocks of a double-dip recession. Clearly, Threadneedle Street believes 2012 is going to be a rotten year. It has doubts about whether the rally in the eurozone is for real. It knows that tight credit conditions are throttling private-sector growth. It senses that it will take time for falling inflation to end the squeeze on real incomes. And it is aware that the big public spending cuts are still to come. As a result, what the Bank announced on Thursday was a damage-limitation exercise. Faced with what it called \"headwinds\", the Bank decided it had no alternative but to pump an additional \u00a350bn into the economy over the next three months. That will take the total purchases of UK government bonds to \u00a3325bn, or about one third of the liquid gilts market. This is the insurance policy against a messy Greek default that has knock-on effects across the rest of the single currency zone, depressed consumer spending, an investment strike by companies hoarding their cash, and the biggest programme of spending cuts in living memory. True, the recent surveys have painted a more positive picture but the Bank is worried it might be a suckers' rally. Next week's quarterly inflation report will flesh out the reasons for today's move, but is likely to show the economy flatlining this year and inflation dropping like a stone. The Bank's decision, while not a surprise, is not without its risks. Inflation remains more than double the government's 2% inflation target, and while Threadneedle Street has sought to quantify the impact of quantitative easing, it does not \u2013 and cannot \u2013 know for sure what the inflationary implications of such a big monetary boost will be. The expectation is that inflation will fall like a stone this year, the result of a bombed-out economy and no repetition of last year's rise in commodity prices. As things stand, that looks a reasonable call. Perhaps a more immediate concern is that QE is not really getting to the parts of the economy that need it, and, in its third incarnation, is subject to the law of diminishing returns. Ed Balls made the point that the Bank was doing its best to avert the risk of a fresh recession but could only do so much. At the very least, there is a case for looking at the mix between monetary and fiscal policy, so that borrowing costs and QE take less of the strain. It might also be the time to think about QE more creatively, perhaps to fund a nationwide green new deal or a national investment bank. The fact that output is still 4% below its pre-recession peak, despite an unprecedented monetary boost since 2008, is an indication that QE has proved to be a blunt instrument.",

      "bodyText": "Kodak, the company that pioneered home photography, is to give up making cameras after more than 110 years. The company, whose little yellow film boxes could once be found throughout the world, said on Thursday it plans to \"phase out its dedicated capture devices business\", which includes all digital cameras, video cameras and digital photo frames. It comes less than a month after Kodak Eastman filed for bankruptcy protection in the US as it finally succumbed to a digital revolution that left its products obsolete following intense competition from rivals in the Far East. \"For some time, Kodak's strategy has been to improve margins in the capture device business by narrowing our participation in terms of product portfolio, geographies and retail outlets,\" Kodak's chief marketing officer Pradeep Jotwani said. \"Today's announcement is the logical extension of that process, given our analysis of industry trends.\" Kodak said it hopes pulling out of cameras will save the company, which has $6.8bn (\u00a34.2bn) of debts, more than $100m a year. It will stop all production of capture devices within the first half of 2012. Exiting the business is expected to cost Kodak $30m. The company has already closed 13 factories and cut 47,000 jobs. It ceased manufacturing its famous Kodachrome film in 2009. The definitive end of the \"Kodak moment\" comes more than 130 years after a \"not especially gifted\" high school dropout, George Eastman, founded the company that dominated photography for most of the 20th century. Kodak produced the first mass market Brownie camera in 1900, priced at $1, with the slogan \"You push the button, we do the rest\". The company went on to control more than 90% of the US film market, and its Kodachrome film was so beloved of amateur and professional photographers that Paul Simon wrote a hit song about it. In 1975 it created the first digital camera, which was the size of a toaster, had to be held still for a 23-second exposure and only produced a 0.01 megapixel black and white image. But the company decided not to bring its new invention to market because of fears it would cannibalise its \u2013 at the time very profitable \u2013 business selling chemicals for traditional film developing. When it finally got round to making mass-market digital cameras it had been left behind by much cheaper rivals in Japan. Kodak will now concentrate on its network of more than 100,000 photo booths worldwide, its inkjet printer business and its Facebook app that allows users to turn digital albums into real prints. The company, which has been given 18 months' breathing space by a $950m loan from Citigroup, is also trying to sell 1,100 patents that it believes are worth more than $1bn.",

A quick analysis of the results published by Lloyds for the same period \u2013 from the start of 2009 to the end of September 2011 \u2013 produces a figure of \u00a355bn. This \u00a355bn includes \u00a345bn of impairment charges (from loans which are not repaid on time): \u00a324bn in 2009, \u00a313bn in 2010 and \u00a37.4bn in the nine months to 2011. A \u00a33.2bn provision for payment protection insurance, \u00a33.6bn of integration costs and a \u00a32.5bn fee for exiting the asset protection scheme push the bill to \u00a355bn. Direct comparisons between the two banks are not straightforward. Lloyds inherited 80% of its impairment charges as a result of the rescue of HBOS during the 2009 banking crisis. RBS's losses were mostly homegrown with some inherited from the acquisition of ABN Amro at the height of the credit crunch in 2007. The \u00a338bn of RBS costs includes \u00a328bn of impairment charges, the near-\u00a31bn provision for mis-sold payment protection insurance, and \u00a32.9bn of restructuring charges as well as credit writedowns caused by the 2007 credit crunch. As a quick reminder, taxpayers put \u00a345bn into RBS and almost \u00a320bn into Lloyds. That totals \u00a365bn. Adding their clean-up bills together comes to \u00a393bn. RBS boss Stephen Hester talked on Wednesday about having the task of defusing \"the biggest time bomb in history\". An interesting question, perhaps, as to which bomb was bigger.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will inject billions more of electronic cash into Britain's flagging economy, extending its quantitative easing programme by \u00a350bn. Economists had widely expected the Bank to resume QE after the UK economy slipped into contraction at the end of last year. Bank policymakers had warned that they saw inflation undershooting its target at the end of the year and hinted that more money-printing was on the cards. At the end of its monthly meeting on Thursday, the Bank's monetary policy committee also left interest rates at a record low of 0.5%. Most economists had expected an additional \u00a350bn in QE, though some had forecast up to \u00a375bn and a handful had forecast none at all. The latest move comes on top of the \u00a3275bn of QE announced since the scheme was launched during the recession in 2009. The decision comes despite business surveys last week suggesting a fresh fall into recession could be averted. Those reports showed a stronger-than-expected start to the year for the dominant services sector as well as for manufacturers. Official data earlier on Thursday showed manufacturing output rose five times faster than expected in December, but the wider industrial sector fared worse than first thought over the fourth quarter. Analysts now await the Bank's quarterly set of economic forecasts, to be published next Wednesday in the inflation report, for clues as to whether there will be any more QE later in the year. \"Recent survey data and today's industrial production figures are encouraging, but the UK data isn't all pointing in one direction,\" said James Knightley at ING Financial Markets, forecasting that weak consumer spending will see the economy stagnate in 2012. \"With inflation plunging due to weak corporate pricing power, falling commodity prices and last year's VAT hike dropping out of the annual comparison, the Bank of England has considerable room to step up its quantitative easing efforts even further.\" The Bank justified the latest decision to inject fresh money by arguing that the UK recovery slowed during 2011 and that inflation was on track to undershoot its government-set target.

But the improvement was not driven by the kind of growth the government has been espousing. Imports of goods fell while exports edged up only slightly.</p> <p>Following are economists' views on the data:</p> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit</h2> <p>Like the production numbers, the official trade data follows the recent upturn in the business survey data, which took so many by surprise, and we therefore expect to see increasing numbers of overly gloomy analysts start revising up their growth forecasts for 2012 in the light of these better-than-anticipated numbers. However, the prospects for the UK economy still look sombre for the rest of the year, and growth is likely to be patchy and lacklustre as better manufacturing performance is offset by weak consumer spending.</p> <h2>Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF</h2> <p>December's production figures show the fourth quarter wasn't a complete write-off, with the strong rebound in manufacturing output hopefully providing a solid platform for continued recovery in the first quarter. In line with a lot of positive reporting and anecdotal evidence we are continuing to see some strong sector performances, especially those with long lead times and exposure to emerging markets.</p> <p>The UK's trade data shows that some sectors are continuing to benefit from strong export demand, particularly in non-EU markets. Overall goods exports reached a record level at the end of last year, making some headway into the overall trade deficit and pointing to encouraging signs of rebalancing across the economy. It is critical this trend continues through 2012, given the reliance on net trade and investment to drive GDP growth this year.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>December's appreciable bounce in manufacturing output is very good news; and together with the improved January survey evidence, boosts hopes that the sector is past the worst and is on course to return to growth in the first quarter, thereby helping the overall economy to also return to growth.</p> <p>However, it needs to be borne in mind that December's rise in manufacturing output followed six successive months of falling production and the sector still faces a very challenging environment. So questions remain as to whether the sector can sustain its improved performance around the turn of the year.</p> <p>Looking through some recent volatile trade data, there is little real evidence of underlying marked improvement, and doubts persist that stronger exports can boost overall growth and help the UK economy to become more balanced.</p> <p>Indeed, serious concern remains that UK exports will be limited for some time to come by the problems in the eurozone and muted global growth.</p> <h2>Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank</h2> <p>Overall, a positive set of data \u2013 albeit a little backward looking. That said, if there were two areas of the economy that one would want to see an improvement in, external trade and manufacturing would be at the top of the list.</p> <h2>Jens Larsen, chief European economist, RBC Capital Markets</h2> <p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee will have received these data in time for its decision today: the impact on the decision and next week's inflation report forecast is marginal, but the flow of positive data is, in our view, consistent with the MPC signalling a halt to purchases in next week's inflation report.</p> <h2>Nida Ali, economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club</h2> <p>These figures further reduce the chances of a technical recession. However, short-term growth prospects are still dominated by downside risks and the eurozone crisis continues to cast a shadow on the outlook for exports and manufacturing.

      "bodyText": "UK factories enjoyed much stronger output growth than expected in December and Britain's trade gap narrowed, boosting hopes recession could be averted. Manufacturing output rose five times faster than expected, up by 1% on the month in the strongest growth for seven months, according to the Office for National Statistics. The ONS also reported that Britain's trade deficit narrowed more than expected. But the improvement was not driven by the kind of growth the government has been espousing. Imports of goods fell while exports edged up only slightly. Following are economists' views on the data: Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit Like the production numbers, the official trade data follows the recent upturn in the business survey data, which took so many by surprise, and we therefore expect to see increasing numbers of overly gloomy analysts start revising up their growth forecasts for 2012 in the light of these better-than-anticipated numbers. However, the prospects for the UK economy still look sombre for the rest of the year, and growth is likely to be patchy and lacklustre as better manufacturing performance is offset by weak consumer spending. Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturers' organisation EEF December's production figures show the fourth quarter wasn't a complete write-off, with the strong rebound in manufacturing output hopefully providing a solid platform for continued recovery in the first quarter. In line with a lot of positive reporting and anecdotal evidence we are continuing to see some strong sector performances, especially those with long lead times and exposure to emerging markets. The UK's trade data shows that some sectors are continuing to benefit from strong export demand, particularly in non-EU markets. Overall goods exports reached a record level at the end of last year, making some headway into the overall trade deficit and pointing to encouraging signs of rebalancing across the economy. It is critical this trend continues through 2012, given the reliance on net trade and investment to drive GDP growth this year. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight December's appreciable bounce in manufacturing output is very good news; and together with the improved January survey evidence, boosts hopes that the sector is past the worst and is on course to return to growth in the first quarter, thereby helping the overall economy to also return to growth. However, it needs to be borne in mind that December's rise in manufacturing output followed six successive months of falling production and the sector still faces a very challenging environment. So questions remain as to whether the sector can sustain its improved performance around the turn of the year. Looking through some recent volatile trade data, there is little real evidence of underlying marked improvement, and doubts persist that stronger exports can boost overall growth and help the UK economy to become more balanced. Indeed, serious concern remains that UK exports will be limited for some time to come by the problems in the eurozone and muted global growth. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank Overall, a positive set of data \u2013 albeit a little backward looking. That said, if there were two areas of the economy that one would want to see an improvement in, external trade and manufacturing would be at the top of the list. Jens Larsen, chief European economist, RBC Capital Markets The Bank of England's monetary policy committee will have received these data in time for its decision today: the impact on the decision and next week's inflation report forecast is marginal, but the flow of positive data is, in our view, consistent with the MPC signalling a halt to purchases in next week's inflation report. Nida Ali, economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club These figures further reduce the chances of a technical recession. However, short-term growth prospects are still dominated by downside risks and the eurozone crisis continues to cast a shadow on the outlook for exports and manufacturing. The domestic economy is struggling against high unemployment and fiscal austerity, making the UK heavily dependent on exports to power the recovery. It is noticeable from these figures that our trade position with non-EU countries improved significantly over the latter months of last year. With the outlook for European markets remaining uncertain, the onus will be on UK exporters to continue efforts to tap into faster-growing emerging nations. Osman Ismail, Centre for Economics and Business Research While the industrial production figures represent a slightly improved December compared with recent trends, caution should be exercised. Domestic demand for industrial output remains subdued, and export orders from our largest trading partner, the euro area, are muted amid the ongoing financial troubles there. While the sector has experienced an increase in demand from non-European markets, such as China, Brazil and the US, this may not be enough to reverse the trend of declining industrial output. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce On trade data: while we should not give too much weight to one month's figures, this is still a welcome development and supports our view that a recession is unlikely. Although the rebalancing of the economy towards exports is moving slowly, it is reassuring that we are heading in the right direction. On manufacturing data: these figures are stronger than expected and support our belief that the UK economy will avoid recession. The sector's overall performance has been relatively weak in recent months. However, the December upturn is positive as it comes in the face of a tough austerity programme at home, and difficult challenges facing UK exporters in the eurozone.",

      "bodyText": "UK factories enjoyed much stronger output growth than expected in December and Britain's trade gap narrowed, boosting hopes recession could still be averted. Manufacturing output rose five times faster than expected, up by 1% on the month in the strongest growth for seven months, according to the Office for National Statistics. But economists cautioned that the fourth quarter of 2011 as a whole saw an even bigger slump for industry than first thought, leaving the overall economy on shaky ground. Against that backdrop the Bank of England announced that it would inject a further \u00a350bn of fresh electronic cash into the economy, taking its quantitative easing (QE) programme to \u00a3325bn. Opinion was divided over whether that would be the final instalment of QE from the bank, given signs that consumers remained under pressure but business had improved across all sectors at the start of this year. The end-of-year rebound for manufacturers chimed with a closely watched business survey last week suggesting that they went on to enjoy a further pick-up in activity in January.

    "webTitle": "Rio Tinto's Tom Albanese says that he doesn't want a bonus", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The head of the global mining group Rio Tinto has become the second FTSE 100 chief executive in as many weeks to voluntarily forgo his bonus. Tom Albanese, who received salaries, bonus and benefits of $2.97m (\u00a31.87m) in 2010, said he would waive his bonus entitlement after Rio was forced to take a $9.3bn charge, largely in relation to its $38.7bn acquisition of Alcan in 2007. High raw material costs, stuttering growth and strong competition from Chinese rivals left the deal for the Canadian-based aluminium firm far short of Albanese's expectations. On Thursday, Rio wrote down the value of this division by $8.9bn and said a number of underperforming assets would be sold off. The total value of Rio writedowns on Alcan is now about $18bn \u2014 half the value of the acquisition. Albanese said: \"Growth in demand for aluminium remains strong but the industry has been running surpluses for the past five years. Chinese production is still tracking internal demand, but has shifted more toward the north-west, where coal is being used to generate electricity. \"As the acquisition of Alcan happened on my watch, I felt it only right not to be considered for an annual bonus this year.\" It is unclear what Albanese's bonus would have been, but his maximum entitlement was $2.8m. He received cash and shares totalling $28.1m (\u00a317.75m) in the four years after the Alcan deal. He received more than half of that \u2014 $15m \u2014 in 2010. The Rio boss admitted, with the benefit of hindsight, that \"the price that we paid [for Alcan] was very high\". He claimed that before the financial crisis few had realised the business world was about to be transformed. \"The world is quite a different place right now.\" Albanese declined to directly answer whether waiving his 2011 bonus was a proportionate response, given cumulative writedowns of $18bn. Instead he repeated: \"It was on my watch. I think it was the appropriate thing to do.\" Sarah Wilson, of corporate governance group Manifest, said: \"Clearly the company has recognised there are shareholder concerns. I am sure shareholders will welcome that. But there may be some shareholders who feel that this is not enough.\" Last year 26% of Rio shareholders voted against the group's boardroom pay arrangements. In 2010, the opposition vote was even higher, at 37%. Shareholders were particularly angered by Rio's decision to raise the potential bonus payouts to executives from 120% of salary to 200%. Rio said it would \"increase the competitiveness\" of short-term incentives. The move by Albanese to forgo his 2011 bonus follows the decision by the Royal Bank of Scotland's chief executive, Stephen Hester, to waive his entitlement last week after months of pressure from executive pay campaigners and politicians. RBS's woes, like those of Rio, stem from a record-breaking takeover battle at the peak of the bull markets in 2007. In the case of RBS, the battle was with Barclays over the Dutch bank ABN Amro; for Rio it was a tussle with Alcoa over Alcan, one of the world's biggest aluminium manufacturers. Rio bought Alcan two months after Albanese was promoted to chief executive of the mining group in May 2007. The deal was described by the then chairman, Paul Skinner, as \"transformational\". He told investors the purchase \"demonstrated the strength and depth of Rio Tinto's managerial capability to deliver value to shareholders\". Albanese received a 2007 pay package worth $3.57m. Rio's current chairman, Jan du Plessis, said he backed Albanese's decision. \"Whilst we have today reported excellent underlying earnings numbers, we also have to recognise that we have taken a significant impairment charge in relation to our aluminium business. As this charge largely relates to the acquisition of Alcan, Tom Albanese and [finance director] Guy Elliott have notified the remuneration committee that they did not wish to be considered for an annual bonus and I think that is absolutely right.\" Rio's net earnings for last year dropped 59% to $5.8bn as a result of the heavy writedowns. However, the group said underlying revenues were up 11% at $15.5bn, with record $27.4bn cash flows from operations. As a result, Du Plessis announced a 34% increase in Rio's full-year dividend to $1.45 a share.",
