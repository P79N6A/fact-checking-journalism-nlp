      "bodyText": "The publisher of the Daily Mirror is poised to announce a \u00a3220m deal to take control of Local World, which owns more than 100 regional titles, to create a local newspaper powerhouse. Trinity Mirror, which also owns the Sunday People and Sunday Mirror, is thought to be close to securing a deal with Local World and could announce completion this week. The publisher, which already owns a portfolio of more than 100 regional titles including the Birmingham Mail, Manchester Evening News and Liverpool Echo, is thought to be paying about \u00a3220m to buy Local World. The deal will make Trinity Mirror, which already owns a 20% stake in Local World, a local newspaper giant. Local World was formed through a merger of more than 100 titles from Daily Mail and General Trust\u2019s Northcliffe Media, and Iliffe News &amp; Media \u2013 including the Nottingham Post and Cambridge News \u2013 in 2012. It is thought that Iliffe parent Yattendon Group, which owns a 21.3% stake in Local World, may keep a couple of its 39 titles out of the deal with Trinity Mirror. Daily Mail owner DMGT holds a 38.73% stake in Local World, which is also backed by Crispin Odey\u2019s Odey Asset Management and Artfefact Group. It is run by David Montgomery, the ex-Trinity Mirror and Mecom chief, who owns a stake in the business. The deal is crucial for Trinity Mirror, which like other newspaper publishers has been hit by a major downturn in the advertising market that has seen revenues fall as much as 30% in some weeks over the summer. \u201cThe core business is performing badly,\u201d said one city source. \u201cThey need a deal to make their numbers this year; investors need to see it is a stock with growth options.\u201d Trinity Mirror had been talks with Richard Desmond about a potential deal to buy \u201ccertain assets\u201d of Express Newspapers, the publisher of the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday. In typical Desmond style, a high price coupled with an \u00a385m pension deficit saw talks go cold. Desmond recently shook up the tabloid market by cutting the price of the Daily Star daily and weekend editions in half. Some observers thought the move might tempt Trinity Mirror back to the negotiating table rather than look to cut its prices to such a level in a commercially unsustainable tabloid price-cutting war.",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s big four high street banks are braced for the competition watchdog to set out a series of measures to make it easier for customers to switch their accounts when the findings of an 18-month review of the industry are published this week. In what could prove to be a crunch week for the industry, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will announce its preliminary conclusions on the \u00a310bn a year personal current account and small business banking markets on Thursday after analysing whether free banking for customers in credit distorts competition. The CMA has sweeping powers which include demanding the big four - Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland - are broken up, which the industry has warned would be very costly. They control 77% of current accounts and 85% of small business accounts, market shares which have barely altered in the last two decades. The powerful watchdog has looked at the impact of free in-credit banking, which banks such as Virgin Money argue make it difficult to compete, as it is difficult for customers to see how much they are paying for banking services. TSB, which was spun out of Lloyds to create a new competitor bank, has argued that banks should be forced to set out how much customers have paid each month in an effort to bolster transparency. In its update in July 2014, the CMA said it was \u201cpossible that there might be a degree of cross-subsidy in the PCA [personal current account] market, which may be distortive of competition\u201d. It added: \u201cIndeed, the \u2018free if in credit\u2019 model often involves cross-subsidy by other revenue streams for PCAs such as overdraft charges. In addition, we were also told that PCAs as a whole were loss-making. \u201cIf this were the case, this could suggest the existence of a cross-subsidy from other retail banking products.\u201d The difficulty of moving current accounts with overdrafts could also be addressed by the CMA. Two years ago the banks attempted to head off a full-blown competition investigation by setting up a seven day current account switching service, although uptake has been disappointing.",

      "bodyText": "The Institute of Directors is facing calls for its chairman, Lady Barbara Judge, to quit because of her involvement with the coal company responsible for America\u2019s worst coalmine disaster in 40 years. The IoD insisted it had \u201ctotal confidence\u201d in Judge following the campaign by Change to Win, a US trade union umbrella group, to urge her to leave because of her role at Massey Energy where she sat on committees overseeing safety and corporate governance. A coal dust explosion in 2010 killed 29 workers in West Virginia, which according to a 972-page official report was \u201cthe result of a series of basic safety violations \u2026 and were entirely preventable\u201d. Judge, who is married to former Conservative party fundraiser Sir Paul Judge, was not criticised. Before the explosion, institutional investors and union groups warned that Judge, who held multiple directorships, would not be able to devote sufficient time to addressing Massey\u2019s already considerable safety issues. Judge, who was appointed chair of the IoD in February, resigned from the coal group three weeks after the disaster, citing the demands of \u201cother ongoing business activities\u201d. In its letter, Change to Win said: \u201cThe evidence of widespread safety problems at Massey mines and red flags pointing towards impending disaster at Upper Big Branch were abundant and yet Lady Judge and her fellow board members failed to act\u201d. The letter, seen by the Guardian, said: \u201cWe believe that Lady Judge spread herself too thin and did not commit the necessary time to effectively oversee Massey Energy during her tenure on the board. Given the dangerous nature of coal mining and Massey\u2019s long-standing history of safety problems, this is indefensible.\u201d Judge, a serial non-executive director with one of the longest CVs in the City, has rejected the criticism. \u201cThroughout my two years as a director, I carried out my duties \u2026 with uncompromised diligence,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no failure of oversight.\u201d In her support, IoD director general Simon Walker told the Guardian: \u201cThe commitment she has given to revitalise the IoD and her role as an astute spokesperson on a range of issues has been an asset. The board and council have total confidence in her ability to operate as our chairman.\u201d According to IoD\u2019s corporate governance guidance: \u201cService on too many boards can interfere with the performance of board members. Companies should consider whether multiple board memberships by the same person are compatible with effective board performance.\u201d Asked about Judge\u2019s large portfolio of directorships, Walker said such matters were \u201cultimately a matter of judgment for those concern\u201d. On her appointment to chair the IoD in February this year, Judge said: \u201cPublic and political scrutiny is intense, so our members must continue to make the case for ethical and successful business through their own behaviour. I want to cement the IoD\u2019s reputation as the home of good governance, where directors and entrepreneurs are trained to the highest standards.\u201d Judge had remained on the Massey board despite 59% of investors opposing her appointment at an annual shareholder meeting in 2009. This month a court in West Virginia began hearing the prosecution case against Massey\u2019s former chief executive Don Blankenship, who faces 30 years in jail if convicted of criminal violations of mine safety laws. He is not charged with causing the 2010 explosion. Blankenship insists he never condoned safety breaches and was working hard to turn around the company\u2019s reputation. Massey, which was acquired by competitor Alpha Natural Resources, reached a $208m (\u00a3135m) settlement with the Department of Justice to settle criminal liability and was filed $11m by the mining regulator. The official findings concerning Massey\u2019s safety record are in sharp contrast to proud claims made in the firm\u2019s glossy social responsibility report published little over a year before the 2010 fatal coal dust explosion. The glossy report declared: \u201cMassey Energy\u2019s members are the best-trained, most productive, and safest miners in the world. We embrace our commitment to safety at all levels \u2013 from executive to miner. At Massey, we understand that no coal company can succeed over the long term without a total commitment to safety. .. We are an industry leader in productivity and safety ... Safety is everyone\u2019s concern.\u201d These and other statements gave a misleading impression of Massey\u2019s safety standards, according to pension funds and other investors who pursued a class action lawsuit. The claim resulted in a $265m out of court settlement, one of the largest such payouts of recent years. It had been brought against the Massey and its former directors \u2014 including Judge and other members of the board\u2019s safety committee.",

We are an industry leader in productivity and safety ... Safety is everyone\u2019s concern.\u201d</p> <p>These and other statements gave a misleading impression of Massey\u2019s safety standards, according to pension funds and other investors who pursued a class action lawsuit. The claim resulted in a $265m out of court settlement, one of the largest such payouts of recent years. It had been brought against the Massey and its former directors \u2014 including Judge and other members of the board\u2019s safety committee.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

      "bodyText": "Some of Britain\u2019s most powerful solar executives have accused the government of mounting an ideologically driven campaign against their industry which has driven it into crisis. Their criticism comes as a solar power company backed by the billionaire inventor Elon Musk has pulled out of the UK, becoming the fourth such firm to close in two weeks. Executives have become increasingly outspoken ahead of a consultation on a proposed 87% cut in small scale solar subsidy levels closing on Friday and job cuts mounting in the industry. The Solar Trade Association (STA) has warned the move could cost up to 27,000 jobs and that the government support would add \u00a31 to bills by 2019 \u2013 on top of the existing \u00a39 that solar adds annually to customer energy bills. \u201cTo let this green success story die, pushing more into unemployment and becoming a burden on the state. It\u2019s obscene,\u201d said Richard Rushin, UK sales manager for Trina, the largest solar panel manufacturer in the world. \u201cWe want to wean ourselves off subsidies as soon as possible but you cannot just cut them by 87%. We believe that [with] \u00a31 on each customer bill the industry can keep 35,000 [people] in a job.\u201d Jonathan Selwyn, managing director of solar installer Lark Energy, is also furious: \u201cWhen the government talks about nuclear and fracking [shale gas] it\u2019s all about investment in energy security and jobs. When it talks about renewables \u2013 not just solar \u2013 it talks about the costs to hardworking British families. \u201cIt\u2019s never about the clean energy we are providing, the security, the jobs, or the investment. We have invested \u00a31bn in the National Grid \u2013 that does not get talked about. It is also providing energy close to the user so its does not need the grid to upgrade itself.\u201d Selwyn said ministers claim solar should stand on its own two feet but points out that nearly every energy sector, including oil and gas, receive subsidies in some shape or form. \u201cWe are all paying \u00a3100 for nuclear decommissioning costs in our bills. Solar: five quid? It is nothing to do with the energy bills of hardworking families \u2013 it is entirely ideologically driven by George Osborne. It is nothing to do with the cost to the energy consumer.\u201d Last week, Howard Johns, a former chairman of the Solar Trade Association and founder of Southern Solar, was forced to close his company with the loss of over 1,000 jobs, joining the Mark Group and Climate Energy. . In a comment piece on the Guardian website, Johns accuses the government of \u201cnothing less than political vandalism on a grand scale\u201d. \u201cWe, the public, have funded the growth of the UK solar industry for a few years now. Now, when it is getting close to not needing any subsidy at all, we are going to close it down. That\u2019s just plain illogical, and can only be ideologically driven,\u201d said Johns. The angry statements from senior industry executives come as the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) prepares to close its latest consultation on subsidies for roof-top solar power being cut from 12.92p to 1.63p per KWh from January next year. Decc said the move is being made to protect consumers from rising bills while reducing the 10% yield \u2013 or high profit margin - for those providing the schemes. \u201cOur priority is to keep bills as low as possible for hardworking families and businesses, and to build a long-term energy efficiency system that gives consumers value for money. We are protecting existing investment and bill payers, while reducing our emissions in the most cost-effective way.\u201d Amber Rudd, the energy and climate change secretary, told political reporters last week that she had been forced to cut back subsidies because her predecessor, the Lib Dem MP Ed Davey, had allowed spending to soar. The Conservative government has already introduced a wave of restrictions onshore wind, energy efficiency and other \u201cgreen\u201d schemes. Critics believe this is driven by a mixture of George Osborne\u2019s wider cuts agenda plus scepticism about the climate change agenda. The STA argues that the current moment is the worst time to cut subsidies because with a little bit more help the industry can be aid-free and compete with carbon heavy fossil fuels by 2020. Already 8GW of solar power has been installed in Britain \u2013 enough to power more than 2m homes \u2013 compared with zero five years ago, while the economics of the industry have been helped by plunging panel costs. But the solar capacity figure could rise to 20GW by the end of this decade with a \u00a33 supplement on top of the existing \u00a39 that solar adds annually to customer energy bills, argues the STA. Leonie Greene, a spokeswoman for the association, says it is \u201ccrazy and shortsighted\u201d to pull the plug from solar at this stage \u201cnot least because it is clear from Germany and elsewhere that solar has the capacity to drive down wholesale electricity prices which also helps the consumer.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank is expected to hint at fresh stimulus measures to ward off the threat of deflation when it holds its next monetary policy meeting on Thursday. This week\u2019s gathering takes place in Malta, under the governing council\u2019s policy of occasionally departing from its Frankfurt HQ to visit other areas of the eurozone. But although the location will be different, the event will be dominated by familiar concerns after the region\u2019s inflation rate fell below zero last month, to -0.1%, for the first time since March. City economists predict that ECB president Mario Draghi will repeat his pledge from September to add more stimulus if needed. However, few expect decisive action this week. \u201cThe ECB\u2019s October meeting is for watching. Draghi\u2019s message will be dovish, but it\u2019s not time to act yet\u201d, said Holger Sandte, chief European analyst at Nordea Bank. The ECB is currently committed to buying \u20ac60bn (\u00a340bn) of government and corporate bonds each month until September 2016, in an \u20ac1.1tn (\u00a3810bn) attempt to stimulate growth, inflation and bank lending. But last week, ECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny declared that it was \u201cquite obvious\u201d that additional instruments would be needed, as the ECB is now \u201cclearly missing\u201d its inflation target. Nowotny\u2019s comments mean that \u201cfurther ECB stimulus as soon as next Thursday certainly cannot be ruled out,\u201d said Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. Capital Economics\u2019s Jonathan Loynes said that ECB will boost its QE firepower \u20ac80bn a month in December, but does not totally rule out an announcement this week. The eurozone\u2019s return to negative inflation is driven by cheaper energy costs, which fell 8.9% year-on-year following the tumble in oil prices. This countered a 1.2% rise in service sector prices, and a 1.4% rise in food, alcohol and tobacco costs. Eurozone firms are also being squeezed, and receiving less for their goods. Producer prices fell by 2.6% year-on-year in August last year, their steepest annual fall since February, suggesting deflationary pressures are building. Yann Quelenn, market analyst at Swissquote Bank, said investors already anticipate that the ECB\u2019s QE programme will be extended beyond next September. But a formal announcement may not come until early 2016, he adds. \u201cBy officially announcing an extension of QE, Draghi will be essentially admitting that the monetary programme is not as efficient as it should be,\u201d said Quelenn. \u201cFor this reason, we believe that he will hold off on making any official commitments for the moment but will continue to drop hints.\u201d Last month, rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s declared that the eurozone will eventually need $2.4 tn of QE. The governing council must also digest recent disappointing economic data from the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. \u201cGerman data for August saw sharp falls in exports and industrial production; perhaps a result of slowing global demand,\u201d said Chris Hare of Investec. Hare also said that Draghi will continue to emphasise a willingness to add more stimulus if needed on Thursday, but will not announce fresh measures just yet. The ECB\u2019s position is complicated by the uncertainty over when the US Federal Reserve will raise US borrowing costs. It resisted a rate hike in September, and may now not act this year. That has weakened the value of the dollar against the euro \u2013 an unwelcome development for the ECB because it adds to deflationary pressures in Europe.",

      "bodyText": "As history has it, the young Isaac Newton found inspiration for the theory of gravity by watching apples fall to the ground. Dan Conlon\u2019s big idea was born after smashing the bell box of a faulty alarm system off the side of his house in the early hours of the morning as the ringing kept the neighbourhood awake. It was not the first time Conlon had had a problem with an alarm. He had previously won a court case after his business broke a contract with an alarm company when the service was frequently out of action and had regular false alarms. So when he and his colleagues were looking for an idea for a new business last year, the home alarm seemed ripe for an overhaul for the internet age. \u201cWe were surprised ... that the technology had not really moved on since the 80s,\u201d he said. \u201cI assumed that there would be loads of easy smartphone connected alarm systems and there were not. \u201cWe found that a lot of people who own an alarm don\u2019t bother to set it either because they don\u2019t believe that it will do anything useful [or] it will be a false alarm and no one will do anything. \u201cBut also, [there is] the hassle factor of keying in a PIN code when you are rushed going out the door in the morning trying to get to work on time.\u201d Next year Cocoon will be launched at a cost of \u00a3299. A device slightly larger than a tennis ball, Cocoon uses a microphone to detect sounds outside of the hearing range of humans to alert in case of intruders in the home. Using smartphones to identify the various residents of the house or flat, the device learns their movements and eliminates them from the sound waves it detects, in turn identifying unusual movements such as those of a burglar. At the heart of the Cocoon unit is a microphone which can detect infrasound waves, which range from about 0.5Hz to 18Hz, and are more commonly associated with communication between elephants or the detection of a volcanic eruption from a distance. \u201cInfrasound is the range of sound which is just below what the human ear can hear. It is still sound, it is still vibrations in the air - in the same way that a sound wave is - but it is very low frequency,\u201d said Conlon, 32. \u201cYou can put a sensor in a building and you can then hear those inaudible sounds that are created by things happening in that building. People moving around move air, vibrate floorboards, they close doors and drawers and so on, so they make infrasound.\u201d The use of infrasound in commercial alarm systems goes back decades. But costs prohibited the sensors being widely used in home alarms, as did the fact that an unsophisticated infrasound microphone would pick up unwanted sound waves, such as people walking by outside or a lorry going past. The five co-founders of Cocoon have used smartphones and machine learning to filter out this noise and isolate the waves which may signal a threat. The device learns over three days how residents come in and out and live. Through an app on the phones of the residents, the device understands their movements and then builds up a model \u2013 or \u201cbrain\u201d according to the company \u2013 of what happens when people are in the home. It knows when people are outside of the home as the phones will not be present. The alert of an intruder can be sent to the smartphone of the residents and a camera on the device \u2013 which also has a siren fitted \u2013 shows images of what is happening within its range. A subscription service is planned where a call centre will monitor the home if an alert goes off and will be able to contact the police. There are potential problems. \u201cIf you have no smartphone, the product is not for you. We think that the vast majority of the population do, specifically our target markets \u2026 the segments that have that high propensity to adopt it first,\u201d Conlon said. What if someone forgets their phone? \u201cIf that happens then the system will not be armed. It will think that they are at home in the same way as if someone forgets to arm up their alarm when they go out,\u201d he said. The company argues that many children who do not have smartphones may be with their parents anyway. \u201cYou can\u2019t really buy a phone that is not a smartphone any more. It is only if you have not had a new phone for five years that it is not Android or iOS,\u201d he said. Initial tests in 15 homes have yet to catch a burglar redhanded, but crucially have also not missed any, said Conlon. What is infrasound? Infrasound is sound with a frequency of less that 20Hz, which is outside of the range that humans can hear. Both elephants and giraffes use it to communicate over long distances, meaning that conservationists can track them when they are hidden in forests. Infrasound is produced when a volcano erupts resulting in the event being able to be tracked from remote locations. It is suspected that a group of birds detected infrasound waves from a storm approaching their breeding grounds last year and subsequently flew to safety.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A glaring anomaly of British energy policy will be on display this week: the government will loudly trumpet a nuclear deal with China, and then will come a no-fanfare end to a controversial solar subsidy consultation. President Xi Jinping will probably sign a heads of agreement with David Cameron that will allow the government to say that a new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset is on its way. The groundwork for the deal was done by George Osborne on his recent trip to Beijing, with the chancellor determined to roll away any obstacles that could halt China becoming a major investor at Hinkley \u2013 and beyond. The chief developer of the new nuclear reactors in the south-west \u2013 the first for 20 years \u2013 is EDF, which has also been trying to woo state-owned Chinese companies to invest in the \u00a324.5bn scheme. Only by promising to allow the Chinese to build their own replacement plant at Bradwell in Essex have Osborne and Cameron finally won Beijing\u2019s support for Hinkley. After that it will be up to EDF to press the final investment button and for construction to start in earnest. Britain undoubtedly needs new electricity generating capacity as old nuclear and coal-fired power stations reach the end of their lives or are retired \u2013 in the case of the latter because of their carbon emissions. And the public has been willing to give atomic power another chance on the grounds that greenhouse gases are a bigger threat than radioactive waste, safety issues and other risks uniquely posed by nuclear technology. But EDF and its engineering partner Areva have queered their own pitch by presiding over mounting cost overruns and project delays at pioneering projects in Finland and France under the control of one or both. Meanwhile the government has been forced to guarantee a subsidy price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for 35 years to EDF to get this far on a scheme that was meant to produce power in 2017 but now will not be ready till 2024 \u2013 and only then if it does not run into the kind of logistical and other difficulties that have hampered similar kinds of plants at Olkiluoto and Flamanville. Ministers have been relentlessly supportive of nuclear, talking up the number of jobs being created \u2013 25,000 in the construction phase \u2013 and talking down the worries about safety, waste, delays and national security. At the same time the Conservative government has been waging what looks like a determined war against solar and other renewables, highlighted by a proposed 87% cut in subsidies from 1 January on rooftop solar panel installations. More than 1,000 jobs have been lost in the past 10 days as three major solar installers have closed their doors in anticipation that ministers will bring burgeoning demand for small solar schemes to an abrupt halt. Unlike the warm words of encouragement and firm policy help for nuclear, there has been a relentlessly negative attack on the solar industry, which ministers have suddenly decided should now stand on its own feet. There have been constant references to hard-pressed bill payers, with the intermittent nature of solar and wind being highlighted by the Department of Energy and Climate Change against the advantages of constant power from nuclear. These generalisations hide a different truth. Renewable energy is largely a new UK private-sector success story, where costs are falling fast and which deserves considered and time-limited support. Nuclear power is a mature technology run by state-owned companies from France and China where costs seem to constantly rise and where 35-year price commitments at double the cost of existing wholesale power should not be being given. With power capacity margins falling so low that many warn the lights could go out this winter, you have to conclude that the government lacks competence as well as vision. Labour\u2019s bank review must be radical Like the Japanese soldiers who spent decades deep in the jungle believing the second world war was still raging outside, central bankers have a tendency to fight their old enemies, regardless of how much the world has changed. With trouble brewing in global financial markets and little or no ammunition left in central bankers\u2019 armouries, questions are growing about whether inflation-targeting \u2013 the regime that evolved after the searing experience of the 1970s inflationary shocks \u2013 is up to the job. Some experts fear that by focusing on stabilising prices, central bankers have put too little emphasis on growth, financial stability and unemployment. As a result, warned HSBC\u2019s Stephen King recently, the world economy may be sailing towards an iceberg. So the decision of Labour\u2019s new shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, to commission the up-and-at-\u2019em Anglo-American economist Danny Blanchflower to review the role of the Bank of England is timely. Blanchflower has been one of the fiercest critics of the Bank\u2019s record, since leaving its interest-rate-setting monetary policy committee in 2009. His new committee has serious heft. Blanchflower will be joined by monetary policy expert (and fierce critic of austerity) Simon Wren-Lewis; his fellow former MPC member Adam Posen; and former Treasury select committee chair John McFall. British lefties have long had a deep-held suspicion of central bankers, believing they are small-c conservatives, fixated with assuaging the international bond markets \u2013 and McDonnell has previously expressed his scepticism about Bank independence. But Blanchflower and his colleagues are expected to focus their attention more on whether paying attention to other indicators, such as unemployment or economic output, might help the monetary policy committee to steer around future icebergs. Blanchflower is keen to examine whether a US Federal Reserve-style mandate, which includes promoting maximum employment as well as controlling inflation, might have helped the MPC to anticipate the turmoil of 2008-09 better \u2014 a labour market expert, he felt at the time that unemployment was a good indicator of the underlying health in the economy. But he and his colleagues might also be wise to take a step back and ask whether an even more radical rethink of the best way to manage monetary policy is necessary. Uber ruling is welcome Black cabs are as quintessentially London as Nelson\u2019s column or a red double decker, but few tears were shed for them by the travelling public after the legality of Uber\u2019s operation was affirmed this week. In truth, the ruling may not have been the watershed many hoped: Uber would have tweaked its app and rolled on. But the fact that the taxi trade is governed by rules so arcane that a judge had to decide if a smartphone is a meter highlights the problem. Uber\u2019s technology lets it slip through the regulatory net. When it comes to as safety, Uber in fact provides more reassurance, with details of drivers, journeys and transactions. The authorities should rightly beware its Silicon Valley \u201ccommon sense\u201d, which could ignore boring things like tax, access and congestion. But when consumers decry the regulation that is supposed to protect them, it clearly has to be overhauled.",

The new-found enthusiasm for sweet potatoes has triggered record supermarket sales but a new variety means they are now not so exotic. British-grown sweet potatoes will go on sale in supermarkets for the first time next week, the first successful results of a crop innovation in the south of England which has taken three years to develop. The move has been hailed as a breakthrough for British farming, as the sweet potato typically relies on warm and dry growing conditions and has until now only been sourced overseas, typically from southern US states such as North and South Carolina, Egypt, Senegal and Israel. Nearly three tonnes of sweet potatoes have this week been lifted from polythene-covered raised outdoor beds at Hill Farm, Farningham in north Kent, marking the successful end of a three-year experiment by Joe Cottingham, group director of the Watts Farms group. \u201cWe have been successful in growing sweet potatoes outdoors in Kent because of careful variety trial work and selection for frost resistance, which the crop is susceptible to,\u201d Cottingham explained. \u201cThey are grown in light soils through a mulch which allows us to get warmer soil temperatures which produce good-sized potatoes. We give the potatoes all the water they need through drippers underneath the mulch which takes them from small plants to much larger plants bearing fruit in five months.\u201d At sites in Bedfordshire, Essex, Kent and Northamptonshire, the company grows and packs over 60 different types of produce including vegetables, fruit and salads. Now one of the the UK\u2019s largest growers of fresh herbs and chillies, thanks to the explosion in popularity of Thai and Mexican food, its specialists have recently also successfully grown fresh kaffir lime leaves and tiny Peruvian pickling peppers called piquinos. \u201cSweet potatoes have been a challenge but we have finally got there after experimenting with a number of different varieties ,\u201d Cottingham said. A white Caribbean sweet potato was rejected as \u201ctoo sweet\u201d for British tastebuds, but the more familiar looking red-skinned, orange-fleshed variety was successfully grown from plants put in the soil in the spring. The farms are major suppliers of fresh produce to supermarkets such as Asda \u2013 where the sweet potatoes will go on sale from Friday \u2013 and to hotels and caterers through their food service business. In March sweet potatoes appeared for the first time in the shopping basket used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) \u2013 as a snapshot of spending \u2013 to measure UK inflation. They are lower in carbohydrates and calories than regular potatoes, as well as having higher fibre content and being high in vitamin A. Sales at Asda are up 50% in the last year. Marks &amp; Spencer said sales were currently \u201cgoing through the roof\u201d, up 112% year on year, while Waitrose reports a 30% year-on-year uplift. Gemma Hodgson, Waitrose vegetable buyer, said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t too long into the past that sweet potatoes were considered exotic. Now they are an everyday staple.

      "bodyText": "A lively spat is going on between two former members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. On one side is David \u201cDanny\u201d Blanchflower, who says the UK has experienced its slowest and worst recovery since the aftermath of the South Sea Bubble in 1720. On the other side is Andrew Sentance, who says the performance of Britain\u2019s labour market since the recession undermines the idea that the country has been going through an unprecedented period of economic purgatory. So who\u2019s right? Given the nature of economics, it will hardly come as a surprise that both Blanchflower and Sentance can claim to be right. Nor, given that the pair repeatedly clashed when they were on the MPC together and have not exactly buried the hatchet since, is it that surprising that they are talking past each other. Blanchflower is absolutely right when he says that it has taken the economy longer to recover from the most recent downturn than it did from any of the other major recessions of the 20th century: the one that came shortly after the end of the first world war, the Great Depression, the stagflation of the mid-1970s, the manufacturing wipe out of the early 1980s, and the housing boom-bust of the early 1990s. This is true even after the latest upward revisions to growth in 2011, 2012 and 2013. Joe Grice, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, said: \u201cWhile the profile of the recovery has changed \u2013 a weaker initial recovery than previously thought followed by stronger growth between 2011 and 2013 \u2013 the overall length and depth of the economic downturn remains very similar to previous estimates. It remains the sharpest downturn and slowest recovery on record.\u201d Slowest recovery in modern times Evidence on the state of the economy is scantier for the 18th and 19th century, but a research paper by the Bank of England, shows that economic cycles were relatively short in the 18th century and that the 19th century saw stronger growth with less volatility. Wars tend to cause a lot of economic damage, but in peacetime there has been nothing to compare with the sluggishness of the recovery from the 2008-09 recession. The UK\u2019s performance is even weaker once a rising population is taken into account. The TUC has looked at trends in GDP per head - a more useful measure - and shown that the recovery since the trough of the recession in 2009 has been comfortably weaker than in any similar period since 1842. This chimes with the South Sea Bubble thesis, given the short, sharp nature of 18th Century downturns. But there is a corollary to the squeeze on per capita incomes, and that is the much better-than-expected record for unemployment. Given the severity of the recession in 2008-09, there were forecasts, including by Blanchflower, that unemployment could rise to 5 million. Blanchflower has taken a lot of stick for this prediction, but it was a reasonable judgement in the light of the increases in joblessness suffered in the early 1980s and early 1990s, when the peak to trough drops in output were smaller and unemployment breached the three million level on both occasions. As it turned out, unemployment peaked at just over 8% following the most recent recession compared to over 10% in the early 1990s and 12% in the mid-1980s. The reason was that there was a period of severe pay restraint that held down overall pay bills and so put employers under less pressure to shed staff. In effect, the UK adopted an incomes policy. In the public sector the incomes policy was statutory, with the government imposing below-inflation settlements. In the private sector, it has been voluntary to the extent that when confronted with the choice, workers have decided that they would rather lose a small proportion of their income through a pay cut rather than lose all of it through redundancy. Britain\u2019s response to the crisis contrasts with France, where both wage growth and unemployment has been higher. French unemployment currently stands at 10.4% - more than double the UK\u2019s joblessness rate. That does not alter the fact that Britain\u2019s economic performance since the financial crisis began in 2007 has been poor. What looked like a promising recovery in late 2009 and early 2010 was snuffed out by policy error (over-aggressive spending cuts and tax increases) and the crisis in the eurozone. Nothing should detract from the fact that this has been an extremely painful period, especially for those who have lost their jobs or been pushed below the breadline. A good recession is an oxymoron. But trading off pay increases for jobs has meant that the pain has been spread around rather than concentrated in a small segment of the population. It is well established, partly from Blanchflower\u2019s own important work in this area, that unemployment - and especially youth unemployment - has a high social cost, in terms of broken marriages, increased incidence of depression and self harm, ill health and suicide rates. A one percentage point increase in the jobless rate is five times as costly in terms of wellbeing as a one point rise in inflation. That suggests that Britain coped with this recession better than it has with other recessions in the recent past. Ultra-low interest rates and forbearance on the part of mortgage lenders meant there was no repeat of the record home repossessions seen in the early 1990s. Wage cuts limited the increase in unemployment while tax credits have - until now at least - topped up those on low and middle incomes. Clearly, it would have been better had there not been a recession in 2008-09. If George Osborne could have his time again, it is possible that the chancellor would have delayed raising VAT and eased up on his public infrastructure cuts in 2010. But what happened, happened. For sure, this has been the slowest recovery in living memory. The economy has not snapped back in the way it did, for example, when exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992 allowed the Major government to slash interest rates. The human cost of the recession and its aftermath was high, but not as high as it would otherwise have been. And, not as high as it was during the period that would win the unwelcome accolade for the most painful episode in Britain\u2019s recent economic history: the early 1980s. That\u2019s because an across the board drop in living standards that doubled in the three decades leading up to the financial crisis drop caused less distress to the nation as a whole than a doubling of unemployment of the sort suffered when whole communities were destroyed by the decimation of the UK\u2019s manufacturing base during Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government. The deep scars from that experience are visible to this day.",

      "body": "<p>A lively spat is going on between two former members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. On one side is David \u201cDanny\u201d Blanchflower, who says the UK has experienced its slowest and worst recovery since the aftermath of the South Sea Bubble in 1720. On the other side is Andrew Sentance, who says the performance of Britain\u2019s labour market since the recession undermines the idea that the country has been going through an unprecedented period of economic purgatory.</p> <p>So who\u2019s right? Given the nature of economics, it will hardly come as a surprise that both Blanchflower and Sentance can claim to be right. Nor, given that the pair repeatedly clashed when they were on the MPC together and have not exactly buried the hatchet since, is it that surprising that they are talking past each other.</p> <p>Blanchflower is absolutely right when he says that it has taken the economy longer to recover from the most recent downturn than it did from any of the other major recessions of the 20th century: the one that came shortly after the end of the first world war, the Great Depression, the stagflation of the mid-1970s, the manufacturing wipe out of the early 1980s, and the housing boom-bust of the early 1990s.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/mro/news-release/national-accounts-changes--full-blue-book-and-pink-book-datasets-published/blue-book-news-release.html\">This is true even after the latest upward revisions to growth in 2011, 2012 and 2013</a>. Joe Grice, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, said: \u201cWhile the profile of the recovery has changed \u2013 a weaker initial recovery than previously thought followed by stronger growth between 2011 and 2013 \u2013 the overall length and depth of the economic downturn remains very similar to previous estimates. It remains the sharpest downturn and slowest recovery on record.\u201d</p> <h2>Slowest recovery in modern times</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37d75a0d46d174559f1d5795412725d913c72822\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/16/1445007437951/e92bdc4c-1777-460d-a6d0-b6f70f5a1f50-460x293.png\" alt=\"Economic recoveries\" width=\"460\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Economic recoveries.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: NIESR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Evidence on the state of the economy is scantier for the 18th and 19th century, <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/qb100403.pdf\">but a research paper by the Bank of England</a>, shows that economic cycles were relatively short in the 18th century and that the 19th century saw stronger growth with less volatility. Wars tend to cause a lot of economic damage, but in peacetime there has been nothing to compare with the sluggishness of the recovery from the 2008-09 recession.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s performance is even weaker once a rising population is taken into account. <a href=\"http://touchstoneblog.org.uk/2015/08/still-easily-the-slowest-recovery-of-gdp-per-head-on-record/\">The TUC has looked at trends in GDP per head </a>- a more useful measure - and shown that the recovery since the trough of the recession in 2009 has been comfortably weaker than in any similar period since 1842. This chimes with the South Sea Bubble thesis, given the short, sharp nature of 18th Century downturns.</p> <p>But there is a corollary to the squeeze on per capita incomes, and that is the much better-than-expected record for unemployment. Given the severity of the recession in 2008-09, there were forecasts, including by Blanchflower, that unemployment could rise to 5 million.</p> <p>Blanchflower has taken a lot of stick for this prediction, but it was a reasonable judgement in the light of the increases in joblessness suffered in the early 1980s and early 1990s, when the peak to trough drops in output were smaller and unemployment breached the three million level on both occasions.</p> <p>As it turned out, unemployment peaked at just over 8% following the most recent recession compared to over 10% in the early 1990s and 12% in the mid-1980s. The reason was that there was a period of severe pay restraint that held down overall pay bills and so put employers under less pressure to shed staff.</p> <p>In effect, the UK adopted an incomes policy. In the public sector the incomes policy was statutory, with the government imposing below-inflation settlements. In the private sector, it has been voluntary to the extent that when confronted with the choice, workers have decided that they would rather lose a small proportion of their income through a pay cut rather than lose all of it through redundancy.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s response to the crisis contrasts with France, where both wage growth and unemployment has been higher.

The veritable cornucopia of delights includes MPs questioning regulators, the results of a competition inquiry into retail banking, and a British Bankers\u2019 Association conference. Expect a tetchy session on Tuesday when the Treasury committee questions Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England\u2019s chief regulator, about the watering-down of post-crisis rules. Andrew Tyrie, the committee\u2019s chairman, has already said he is disappointed that the burden of proof has been removed from bosses whose banks fail. The next day, John Griffith-Jones, chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority, will no doubt face questions about the ousting of Martin Wheatley as chief executiveand the whereabouts of the long-delayed report into HBOS\u2019s near-collapse. On Thursday the Competition and Markets Authority reports on the state of retail banking and the BBA holds its shindig in London. Speakers include Sir Hector Sants, the former chief executive of the Financial Services Authority. He says people should be \u201cvery afraid\u201d of the regulator but Wheatley\u2019s sacking from the FCA shows the political mood has shifted. Barclays, where Sants briefly headed a push to get on better with regulators, is close to hiring a US investment banker as its boss. What, if anything, does Sants make of it all? One last cup of coffee So it\u2019s goodbye, Andy Harrison. The chief executive of Whitbread, the parent of Costa and Premier Inn, will present his final set of results on Tuesday. After running three big companies, Harrison is worn out and fancies a less stressful time. Fair enough, but Harrison probably knows that keeping things going at the same rate will not be easy. In his five years running Whitbread its market value has risen from \u00a32.5bn to \u00a38.4bn. He\u2019s been well rewarded, receiving more than \u00a311m in the last two years. Yet Whitbread\u2019s market value is more than \u00a31bn less than the \u00a39.7bn when Harrison announced his departure in April with the shares near a record. The wider market is down too, but now there\u2019s George Osborne\u2019s \u201cnational living wage\u201d to deal with. Waiting to take over in December is Alison Brittain, who joined last month from Lloyds Banking Group. It remains to be seen how many more flat whites and Americanos Brittain can persuade us to consume and whether China, where Costa wants to have 900 shops by 2020, develops a similar caffeine habit. But for now it\u2019s time to enjoy Harrison\u2019s relentless sales pitch one more time. An each-way bet Britain\u2019s two best-known bookmakers publish trading statements this week at a time when the sector in a state of flux. Kicking things off is Ladbrokes on Tuesday. Long the wheezing old nag of the sector, Ladbrokes got quite exciting when it announced plans to merge with Gala Coral, its unlisted rival. Next day it\u2019s thoroughbred William Hill, which mastered the online game earlier than its mainstream opponents. At first glance, Ladbrokes\u2019 deal with Gala Coral will make it Britain\u2019s biggest bookie, with more branches than William Hill. The merger also promises to add Gala Coral\u2019s superior online operation to Ladbrokes\u2019 struggling one. But the deal faces a long competition inquiry that is likely to lead to lots of shops being sold off. The merger is unlikely to be complete until July next year. There is also a lingering question over Andy Hornby, the former HBOS chief executive who is Gala Coral\u2019s chief operating officer. Hornby, who is likely to be criticised whenever the official report into HBOS\u2019s near implosion appears, is not lined up to sit on the combined group\u2019s main board \u2013 for now at least. Analysts expect both groups to have suffered poor racing results. In the long term, it\u2019s far from clear that the Ladbrokes-Gala Coral combo will be able to outrace William Hill.",

    "webTitle": "It\u2019s hard being shadow chancellor. Howe and Healey knew it", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is proving quite a month for chancellors and shadow chancellors. The symmetry with which Geoffrey Howe, chancellor 1979-83, followed Denis Healey, chancellor 1974-79, both in life and in death (they died within a week of each other) was remarkable. They both lived to a ripe old age \u2013 Healey to 98 and Howe to 88 \u2013 and got on famously, despite the oft-quoted jibe by Healey that being attacked by Sir Geoffrey (as he then was) in parliament was like being savaged by a dead sheep. At a time when Labour\u2019s new shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is being savaged by the Conservatives, the media and many of his colleagues, it is worth recalling that both Healey and Howe also had baptisms of fire when they themselves were appointed shadow chancellors. Healey was often accused of rashness in allegedly threatening, in opposition, to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d. But he never said it. What he actually said, at Labour\u2019s 1973 annual conference, was: \u201cI warn you, there are going to be howls of anguish from 80,000 rich people, people who are rich enough to pay over 75% on the last slice of their income.\u201d He got into enough trouble for that, and it was a feature of Howe\u2019s first budget in 1979 that the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60%, where it remained until Nigel Lawson\u2019s budget of 1988, when the top rate came down to 40%. Sir Geoffrey was often an ineffectual shadow chancellor. As Healey said: \u201cHe found this role difficult, as I had, although he was usually able to make some telling points. Fortunately for me, their effect was often blunted by his mumbling diction.\u201d Hence the \u201cdead sheep\u201d remark, which Healey freely admitted was an adaptation of Churchill\u2019s wisecrack that being attacked by Attlee was \u201clike being savaged by a pet lamb\u201d. The savaging from all sides of McDonnell for his \u201cU-turn\u201d on the fiscal charter is painful and embarrassing, but the shadow chancellor did not get where he is today without being able to take it. He really overstepped the mark when committing himself to George Osborne\u2019s absurd charter, which has been ridiculed even by the chancellor\u2019s sometime cheerleader, my old employer the Financial Times. One of Osborne\u2019s favourite pursuits is wrongfooting the Labour party. It must be conceded that he is good at it. But it is going to his head: hubris is already in the air, and at some stage he will come a cropper. However, in his desire not to sound weak on the subject of \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d, McDonnell fell into Osborne\u2019s trap. But the shadow chancellor is plainly aware of Healey\u2019s dictum: \u201cWhen you are in a hole, don\u2019t dig deeper.\u201d This silly, but mercifully shortlived, commitment to the charter was the reason why I wrote in my last column that I was not so sure Ed Balls was right to say that McDonnell must be the first shadow chancellor who is to the left of your correspondent. Of course, just as Osborne was wrong to blame the deficit on Labour\u2019s public spending (much of which was highly beneficial for the nation at large) rather than the banking crisis, so his argument that the Conservatives have always been the party of economic and fiscal responsibility takes some swallowing. For example, Healey\u2019s chancellorship was bedevilled, among other things, by the aftermath of the Tory \u201cBarber boom\u201d of 1973, when output rose at a record and quite unsustainable rate of 6% a year, and inflation accelerated at a terrifying pace. This latter was the result of a sharp rise in oil prices, for which the 1970-74 government of Edward Heath could not be blamed, but also of the government\u2019s earlier decision to index wage increases to the cost of living, which was well-intentioned but proved disastrous when oil prices quintupled. The obituary writers have been kind to Howe, who was himself a kind and gentle man. But his embrace of monetarism, and near doubling of VAT, led to a rise in the inflation rate from the 10% he inherited to 20% between 1979 and 1980, and the overvaluation of the pound contributed to the worst recession the UK had experienced since the second world war. Later came Lawson\u2019s unsustainable boom, the ill-timed entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, and another horrible recession. No, the Conservative party protests too much when it claims to be the custodian of economic competence. And now its obsession with balancing the budget \u2013 indeed, aiming for a surplus on both current and capital accounts \u2013 promises to make the austerity we have experienced so far look like a vicarage tea party. The damage about to be wreaked by the reductions in tax credits may well prove to be Osborne\u2019s poll tax moment. There is much for an opposition that gets its act together to oppose. These are early days to be writing off Mr McDonnell. As for that ridiculous charter, the proposal to bind successor governments to fiscal rules is simply not constitutional. The point of macroeconomic policy is to balance the economy, not to balance the budget, let alone run a surplus that in certain circumstances might depress demand. This government boasts about flexibility in the labour market. You also need flexibility in economic policy. As Lords Healey and Howe knew, there are such things as \u201cevents, dear boy\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>It is proving quite a month for chancellors and shadow chancellors. The symmetry with which Geoffrey Howe, chancellor 1979-83, followed Denis Healey, chancellor 1974-79, both in life and in death (they died within a week of each other) was remarkable.</p> <p>They both lived to a ripe old age \u2013 Healey to 98 and Howe to 88 \u2013 and got on famously, despite the oft-quoted jibe by Healey that being attacked by Sir Geoffrey (as he then was) in parliament was like being savaged by a dead sheep.</p> <p>At a time when Labour\u2019s new shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, is being savaged by the Conservatives, the media and many of his colleagues, it is worth recalling that both Healey and Howe also had baptisms of fire when they themselves were appointed shadow chancellors.</p> <p>Healey was often accused of rashness in allegedly threatening, in opposition, to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d. But he never said it. What he actually said, at Labour\u2019s 1973 annual conference, was: \u201cI warn you, there are going to be howls of anguish from 80,000 rich people, people who are rich enough to pay over 75% on the last slice of their income.\u201d</p> <p>He got into enough trouble for that, and it was a feature of Howe\u2019s first budget in 1979 that the top rate was reduced from 83% to 60%, where it remained until Nigel Lawson\u2019s budget of 1988, when the top rate came down to 40%.</p> <p>Sir Geoffrey was often an ineffectual shadow chancellor. As Healey said: \u201cHe found this role difficult, as I had, although he was usually able to make some telling points. Fortunately for me, their effect was often blunted by his mumbling diction.\u201d Hence the \u201cdead sheep\u201d remark, which Healey freely admitted was an adaptation of Churchill\u2019s wisecrack that being attacked by Attlee was \u201clike being savaged by a pet lamb\u201d.</p> <p>The savaging from all sides of McDonnell for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/13/john-mcdonnell-says-fiscal-charter-u-turn-due-to-meeting-redcar-families\" title=\"\">his \u201cU-turn\u201d on the fiscal charter</a> is painful and embarrassing, but the shadow chancellor did not get where he is today without being able to take it. He really overstepped the mark when committing himself to George Osborne\u2019s absurd charter, which has been ridiculed even by the chancellor\u2019s sometime cheerleader, my old employer the <em>Financial Times</em>.</p> <p>One of Osborne\u2019s favourite pursuits is wrongfooting the Labour party. It must be conceded that he is good at it. But it is going to his head: hubris is already in the air, and at some stage he will come a cropper. However, in his desire not to sound weak on the subject of \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d, McDonnell fell into Osborne\u2019s trap. But the shadow chancellor is plainly aware of Healey\u2019s dictum: \u201cWhen you are in a hole, don\u2019t dig deeper.\u201d</p> <p>This silly, but mercifully shortlived, commitment to the charter was the reason why I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/04/mcdonnell-lands-blow-on-chancer-of-exchequer\" title=\"\">wrote in my last column</a> that I was not so sure Ed Balls was right to say that McDonnell must be the first shadow chancellor who is to the left of your correspondent.</p> <p>Of course, just as Osborne was wrong to blame the deficit on Labour\u2019s public spending (much of which was highly beneficial for the nation at large) rather than the banking crisis, so his argument that the Conservatives have always been the party of economic and fiscal responsibility takes some swallowing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"480e909398305eb48fc851f5d6d85405596e9b57\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/10/16/1444994559307/9b3fe497-681a-4796-8619-0de66462db6f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"John McDonnell during the debate on the fiscal charter.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John McDonnell during the debate on the fiscal charter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For example, Healey\u2019s chancellorship was bedevilled, among other things, by the aftermath of the Tory \u201cBarber boom\u201d of 1973, when output rose at a record and quite unsustainable rate of 6% a year, and inflation accelerated at a terrifying pace.
