    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Aldi has vowed to maintain the supermarket price war that has drawn legions of cost-conscious shoppers to its aisles as it announced a 65% increase in its UK profits. The German discounter said it would respond to price cuts from competitors with further discounts and claimed that attempts by rivals to match its budget approach had only served to boost sales. Aldi reveals on Monday that UK sales increased 36% to \u00a35.3bn last year and pre-tax profits climbed by nearly two-thirds to \u00a3261m. The announcement comes a week after the most prominent victim of Aldi\u2019s success, Tesco, saw its woes deepen with the admission that it had overstated profit estimates by \u00a3250m. \u201cWhatever our competitors plan to do, we know exactly what our response will be and our competitors do as well. We will not let them compete on price. We will not let them close the gap,\u201d said Matthew Barnes, Aldi\u2019s UK joint managing director. He added that copycat discounts imposed by Tesco and Morrisons had made shoppers even more aware of cost \u2013 to Aldi\u2019s benefit. \u201cPrice cuts [by rivals] have encouraged consumers to think more about what supermarkets charge,\u201d he said. Aldi opened 42 new stores last year and attracted 1 million more customers, capitalising on a significant change in shopping habits that is hitting the traditional supermarket giants hard. Aldi is to open 54 new stores in the UK in 2014 and next year it plans up to 65, taking its total number of outlets to over 600. The UK chain, which is owned by the Albrecht family, based in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr in western Germany, is aiming to have 1,000 stores by 2021. Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons have all lost market share in the past year as the low prices offered by Aldi and fellow German discounter Lidl have tempted customers away. Aldi has also lured shoppers with smaller, uncomplicated stores based in neighbourhoods rather than out-of-town locations. Established retailers have been forced to cut prices to become more competitive with Aldi and Lidl \u2013 but Aldi has only lowered its prices in response. \u201cWe want to have a minimum of a 15% basket discount [to the UK\u2019s major chains] and the reality is that it\u2019s higher than that,\u201d Barnes said. His fellow managing director, Roman Heini, added: \u201cOur competitors have mentioned the need to close the gap on Aldi, but we are clear that we will maintain that price gap and are determined to do so.\u201d The Aldi executives said they were prepared to take a cut in profit margins in order to maintain their lead. Heini said Aldi\u2019s business model, based on selling about 2,500 products \u2013 less than a tenth of the range sold in the average British supermarket \u2013 meant that the major chains would never be able to match its prices. Aldi is able to order this selection, more than 90% of which is own-label products, through bulk-buying, while dictating the package size in order to fit the maximum amount of goods on its shelves and lorries in order to keep costs low. While low prices are the magnet for most shoppers, Aldi has also broadened its appeal with clever marketing and more fresh foods. This Christmas it will offer nearly a third more premium products than it had in stores last year, including caviar, fresh crab and fresh scallops, as it tries to draw in wealthier shoppers on the lookout for bargains. Several of Aldi\u2019s newer stores will be more than a quarter larger than its current average store size of 1,000 square metres in order to squeeze in this wider range of products. At Christmas and other peak sales periods like Easter and the summer holidays it adds another 200 or so items to its product list. \u201cThere are still members of the public that don\u2019t shop with us. Some because they don\u2019t have access to our stores, some because they are yet to be convinced, and Christmas is a fantastic chance for us to showcase that you can get everything and more that you need,\u201d said Barnes.",

We will not let them compete on price. We will not let them close the gap,\u201d says Matthew Barnes, a smooth-talking Brit who has risen through Aldi\u2019s ranks to lead the UK business alongside German-born colleague Roman Heini.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s our DNA, that\u2019s our patch, that\u2019s what we stand for and that\u2019s what our customers expect and we are in the habit of giving our customers what they want. We want to have a minimum of a 15% basket discount [to the UK\u2019s major chains] and the reality is that it\u2019s higher than that.\u201d</p> <p>Such drive has turned Aldi into a serious player in the cut-throat world of British retail, gobbling up market share to leave it a breath away from surpassing Waitrose as the UK\u2019s sixth largest grocer. Sales at the store, where 95% of products are own-label, rose nearly 36% last year to \u00a35.3bn, and pre-tax profits soared 65% to \u00a3260.9m, according to figures released today.</p> <p>Buoyed by the success of its frugal business model, Aldi is not letting up on the pace of growth. It has less than 600 stores in the UK and is planning a \u00a3600m expansion spree, adding 54 stores this year and up to 65 next year with an aim for 1,000 outlets by 2021. Aldi\u2019s heartlands are in the north and Midlands. It has just 21 stores in London, as it has found it tough to afford suitable sites inside the M25. But Barnes and Heini are testing a way to crack the capital. Aldi\u2019s first small convenience store opened in Kilburn 18 months ago, and its second will open in Tooting Bec, south London, next autumn. \u201cIt\u2019s a very considered process which we are certainly not rushing but Kilburn has smashed all our targets and expectations,\u201d says Barnes.</p> <p>With shoppers now fully aware of the low prices at Aldi and its fellow German discounter Lidl, mighty Tesco, the giant British retailer, which came close to controlling a third of all grocery sales in the UK, is in disarray, while Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s are also suffering. All have been forced to cut prices in a bid to stop shoppers leaking away. Yet Aldi has only echoed those price drops to maintain its lead on price.</p> <p>\u201cWe have reduced our gross margins in the last year to ensure we compete and we will maintain that even if we have to reduce gross margins further to deliver,\u201d says Baines.</p> <p>Competing on price is difficult for the large supermarket groups, which can stock more than 40,000 different products in their largest stores, but are up against the limited range of goods in discounters like Aldi.</p> <p>By sourcing large amounts of only 2,500 products, Aldi is able to keep costs low and pass on the benefit to shoppers. Efficiency, simplicity and cost saving run right through the business. Because more than 90% of its goods are own-label, packaging can be designed to fit the maximum amount onto shelves and pallets so no space in a store or lorry is wasted. While rivals might leave air at the top of a box of cereal to make you feel you are getting more for your money, Aldi keeps \u201cullage\u201d, as it\u2019s known in the business, to a minimum because it is focused on efficiency. All that helps deliver prices that are tempting a growing number of shoppers to buy their full weekly grocery shop at Aldi\u2019s stores.</p> <p>Price may be an important factor in Aldi\u2019s recent success, but it is not the whole story. The grocer, which takes its name from the first letters of the Albrecht family that own it, and the last two from \u201cdiscount\u201d, has been in the UK for nearly 25 years and for much of that time had little impact.</p> <p>Four years ago there was a change of plan. Heini, who had set up Aldi\u2019s Swiss business, and Barnes, who worked his way up through Aldi\u2019s ranks via a spell in Australia, took charge in the UK. They widened the range of products to include more fresh fruit, vegetables and meat and worked more closely with British suppliers.</p> <p>In the past 10 years, the range of fresh fruit and vegetables has gone from just 10 items to 100. A focus on British sourcing has seen sales of fresh meat rise 60% a year in the last three years despite Aldi being one of the big names involved in the horse meat scandal in 2013, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/09/aldi-100-percent-horsemeat-beef-products\" title=\"\">two of its readymeals found to have been severely tainted</a>. All the beef and chicken in Aldi\u2019s British ready meals now comes from the UK.</p> <p>Another fast-growing area is its Specially Selected range of premium foods, from brioche buns to speciality coffees, which increased sales by 90% last year. Overall, Aldi has increased its range of products from about 900 to more than 2,500 regular lines topped up by at least 200 more seasonal products as it tries to broaden its appeal.</p> <p>\u201cOur transformation from a top-up to a full shopping destination is well underway. It has taken nearly four years. We are increasing the number of items in shoppers\u2019 baskets every month but there has been great traction in the last 12 to 18 months driven by range and quality improvements,\u201d says Heini. He says shoppers\u2019 tastes have also swung Aldi\u2019s way, with more cynicism about the major grocer\u2019s promotions and discounts compared to Aldi\u2019s tactic of offering low prices on a permanent basis.</p> <p>The economic downturn has helped Aldi and its fellow discounter, Lidl. With shoppers short of spare cash, they have been more willing to seek out alternatives where they can save money. Both have managed to attract an increasing number of middle-class shoppers with deals on treats like champagne and fine wines. More than half, 51%, of Aldi\u2019s shoppers are now in the wealthiest ABC1 demographic.</p> <p>Now the economy is improving, Aldi wants to hold on to those big spenders. This Christmas it will increase its premium Specially Selected range by nearly a third compared to last year. It is also installing 5km of extra chiller cabinets across the chain so that it can bring in more fresh fruit, pre-prepared salads and delicacies like fresh crab, fresh scallops and smoked salmon for Christmas and beyond. Instore bakeries are being trialled and Aldi is stocking an increasing number of ready meals \u2013 products which have traditionally been the heartland of supermarkets like Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco.</p> <p>There is a risk that all these extra services and products may complicate Aldi\u2019s offer. Its bargain-hunting shoppers may be put off. Barnes and Heini admit they will not be able to extend Aldi\u2019s range of goods much further and there is a limit to the size of stores it can operate. Recently, there have been signs of a slowdown in the pace of growth and it remains to be seen whether Aldi can hold shoppers\u2019 attention once they have more spare cash in their pockets.</p> <p>Whatever happens, Barnes believes Aldi has the answer: \u201cWe are completely dedicated to the discount model and keeping it simple,\u201d he says.</p>",

Aldi\u2019s heartlands are in the north and Midlands. It has just 21 stores in London, as it has found it tough to afford suitable sites inside the M25. But Barnes and Heini are testing a way to crack the capital. Aldi\u2019s first small convenience store opened in Kilburn 18 months ago, and its second will open in Tooting Bec, south London, next autumn. \u201cIt\u2019s a very considered process which we are certainly not rushing but Kilburn has smashed all our targets and expectations,\u201d says Barnes. With shoppers now fully aware of the low prices at Aldi and its fellow German discounter Lidl, mighty Tesco, the giant British retailer, which came close to controlling a third of all grocery sales in the UK, is in disarray, while Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s are also suffering. All have been forced to cut prices in a bid to stop shoppers leaking away. Yet Aldi has only echoed those price drops to maintain its lead on price. \u201cWe have reduced our gross margins in the last year to ensure we compete and we will maintain that even if we have to reduce gross margins further to deliver,\u201d says Baines. Competing on price is difficult for the large supermarket groups, which can stock more than 40,000 different products in their largest stores, but are up against the limited range of goods in discounters like Aldi. By sourcing large amounts of only 2,500 products, Aldi is able to keep costs low and pass on the benefit to shoppers. Efficiency, simplicity and cost saving run right through the business. Because more than 90% of its goods are own-label, packaging can be designed to fit the maximum amount onto shelves and pallets so no space in a store or lorry is wasted. While rivals might leave air at the top of a box of cereal to make you feel you are getting more for your money, Aldi keeps \u201cullage\u201d, as it\u2019s known in the business, to a minimum because it is focused on efficiency. All that helps deliver prices that are tempting a growing number of shoppers to buy their full weekly grocery shop at Aldi\u2019s stores. Price may be an important factor in Aldi\u2019s recent success, but it is not the whole story. The grocer, which takes its name from the first letters of the Albrecht family that own it, and the last two from \u201cdiscount\u201d, has been in the UK for nearly 25 years and for much of that time had little impact. Four years ago there was a change of plan. Heini, who had set up Aldi\u2019s Swiss business, and Barnes, who worked his way up through Aldi\u2019s ranks via a spell in Australia, took charge in the UK. They widened the range of products to include more fresh fruit, vegetables and meat and worked more closely with British suppliers. In the past 10 years, the range of fresh fruit and vegetables has gone from just 10 items to 100. A focus on British sourcing has seen sales of fresh meat rise 60% a year in the last three years despite Aldi being one of the big names involved in the horse meat scandal in 2013, with two of its readymeals found to have been severely tainted. All the beef and chicken in Aldi\u2019s British ready meals now comes from the UK. Another fast-growing area is its Specially Selected range of premium foods, from brioche buns to speciality coffees, which increased sales by 90% last year. Overall, Aldi has increased its range of products from about 900 to more than 2,500 regular lines topped up by at least 200 more seasonal products as it tries to broaden its appeal. \u201cOur transformation from a top-up to a full shopping destination is well underway. It has taken nearly four years. We are increasing the number of items in shoppers\u2019 baskets every month but there has been great traction in the last 12 to 18 months driven by range and quality improvements,\u201d says Heini. He says shoppers\u2019 tastes have also swung Aldi\u2019s way, with more cynicism about the major grocer\u2019s promotions and discounts compared to Aldi\u2019s tactic of offering low prices on a permanent basis. The economic downturn has helped Aldi and its fellow discounter, Lidl. With shoppers short of spare cash, they have been more willing to seek out alternatives where they can save money. Both have managed to attract an increasing number of middle-class shoppers with deals on treats like champagne and fine wines. More than half, 51%, of Aldi\u2019s shoppers are now in the wealthiest ABC1 demographic. Now the economy is improving, Aldi wants to hold on to those big spenders. This Christmas it will increase its premium Specially Selected range by nearly a third compared to last year. It is also installing 5km of extra chiller cabinets across the chain so that it can bring in more fresh fruit, pre-prepared salads and delicacies like fresh crab, fresh scallops and smoked salmon for Christmas and beyond. Instore bakeries are being trialled and Aldi is stocking an increasing number of ready meals \u2013 products which have traditionally been the heartland of supermarkets like Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco. There is a risk that all these extra services and products may complicate Aldi\u2019s offer. Its bargain-hunting shoppers may be put off. Barnes and Heini admit they will not be able to extend Aldi\u2019s range of goods much further and there is a limit to the size of stores it can operate. Recently, there have been signs of a slowdown in the pace of growth and it remains to be seen whether Aldi can hold shoppers\u2019 attention once they have more spare cash in their pockets. Whatever happens, Barnes believes Aldi has the answer: \u201cWe are completely dedicated to the discount model and keeping it simple,\u201d he says.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Virgin Money, the bank that is part-owned by Sir Richard Branson and contains some of the remnants of the bailed-out Northern Rock, will announce its flotation on the stock market this week. Company insiders say the bank is to begin promoting a listing within days and that the business is expected to attract a valuation of around \u00a32bn. The move, which has been widely expected, will also provide a small \u00a350m windfall for the taxpayer, which Virgin Money agreed to pay to the Treasury if they floated the bank on the stockmarket before 2016. Branson\u2019s Virgin Group owns 47% of Virgin Money, with US billionaire Wilbur Ross owning about 45%, although bank insiders say that neither major shareholder is looking to sell out totally. In 2011 Virgin Money paid \u00a3747m for Northern Rock\u2019s \u201cgood bank\u201d, which was shorn of the toxic mortgages that are still in the hands of the taxpayer. However, Virgin Money\u2019s estimated \u00a32bn valuation will not represent a paper profit on the Northern Rock deal because the bank has made acquisitions since and does not rely on the rump of Northern Rock for the entirety of its business. Virgin Money will also be the latest challenger bank to list on the stock market. It follows TSB, which was spun out of Lloyds Banking Group earlier this year, alongside the flotations of One Savings Bank and Aldermore. Other banks waiting in the wings for flotations include Shawbrook, Metro Bank, Santander\u2019s UK division and the Williams &amp; Glynn business carved out of Royal Bank of Scotland. Earlier this month, Virgin Money reported a quadrupling in underlying profits from \u00a313m to \u00a360m and gave a large hint that a flotation was imminent, with the appointment of Glen Moreno as its chairman. Moreno, the chairman of publisher Pearson, who had often been cited as a potential candidate to chair a bank, will take over by the middle of next year. He was the acting chairman of UK Financial Investments, set up to manage the government\u2019s shareholdings in UK banks, including Northern Rock, in 2009. He had already left before a deal was agreed to sell the operation to Virgin Money. Virgin Money, which in its Northern Rock days was briefly the biggest mortgage lender in Britain, said it advanced \u00a32.5bn in loans in the first half of this year, taking its total mortgage book to \u00a320.3bn. But this remains a quarter of the level before Northern Rock imploded, with the controversial book of toxic 125% loan-to-value mortgages still in the hands of the taxpayer. Speaking this month, Jayne-Anne Gadhia, Virgin Money\u2019s chief executive, said the business benefited from being a challenger bank. \u201cWe are not burdened by the historical conduct and legacy challenges that face many incumbent banks. We remain confident that we can continue to make real progress on our quest to make banking better and can continue to grow our business strongly, profitably and responsibly.\u201d The Competition and Markets Authority has set out plans for an 18-month investigation into services for small business customers and personal accounts because of a lack of competition.",

      "bodyText": "A recent competition run by an American bacon manufacturer to win an iPhone-connecting device that emits the smell of rashers with the wake-up alarm could be viewed as a cruel trick on the senses. But it proved popular with thousands of entrants and marked a breakthrough for the London-based academic behind the technology. Adrian Cheok, professor of pervasive computing at City University London, designed the gadget, which attached to the iPhone via its headphone jack and released a puff of bacon-scented mist, as well as the sound of frying, in a promotion for the Oscar Mayer meat company dubbed Wake Up and Smell the Bacon. Cheok\u2019s device may have been harnessed to an advertising gimmick, but the Australian scientist has an ambitious plan: to transmit taste and smell electronically so that when someone looks at a picture of a rose on a phone they are able to smell it, or experience the aroma of a Spanish paella when looking at snaps from their holiday on the Costa Brava. Cheok\u2019s technology is also behind a device available in Japan called Scentee, which is a small balloon-shaped smartphone attachment that emits a smell when programmed to do so. The \u00a312 device has a motor that vibrates and emits a mist containing the concentrated fluid essence of rose, coffee, lavender or rosemary, among others. It can be programmed to give out a hazy floral puff when someone\u2019s partner contacts them. Smells are contained in separate attachments, which are sold individually and contain between 200 and 300 bursts. This first step to bringing more senses to the digital world follows a career in which 42-year-old Cheok has worked on augmented reality systems, where computers enhance a user\u2019s experience. One of his creations was a virtual reality Pac-Man challenge, where the user would put on a specially designed suit and headset to roam the streets looking for \u201ccookies\u201d. Cheok said: \u201cIn the real world we don\u2019t just sense the world with our eyes, we have five senses. \u201cSo with virtual reality, we can see a virtual rose on the table but we can\u2019t touch it, we can\u2019t pick it up, we can\u2019t smell it, we can\u2019t taste it. That is when I started to think that we needed to develop a new type of augmented reality for all of the five senses.\u201d During early experiments he worked with elderly people, developing applications to avoid loneliness so that relatives could cook together via the internet while separated. Cooking utensils were augmented to include haptic technology \u2013 devices that recreate the sense of touch. This allowed users to \u201cfeel\u201d when they were doing their tasks and used 3D food printers to replicate meals. \u201cRight now when we think about computing, we don\u2019t think that we can have taste and smell experiences. But actually taste and smell are the only two senses which are connected to the limbic system of the brain, which is also responsible for the emotion and memory,\u201d said Cheok. \u201cIt is actually true that a smell can subconsciously change your mood, so they are very important senses that you can bring to the internet, especially when you are talking about emotional communication [between] for example the elderly and grandchildren,\u201d he added. The main problem with transmitting taste and smell was clear. While light and sound can be digitised, taste and smell are chemically based and \u201cyou can\u2019t send chemicals through wires,\u201d he said. The initial development was the Scentee, which was launched in Japan and emits only single smells. This is just a first step, however, and other more ambitious projects are in progress. A prototype device has been made that stimulates sweet, sour, salty and bitter tastes when the prongs are pressed on a person\u2019s tongue. Low-level electrical currents stimulate the taste neuron, which produces artificial taste sensations. Cheok is also working with neuroscientists to make a magnetic coil to go in the back of the mouth to indirectly stimulate the olfactory bulb, a key part of the brain responsible for smell. Using a device like a mouthguard, he said, this could produce artificial smell perception in the brain. \u201cOnce you have digitised this signal, you can transmit through the internet. You can transmit to your mobile phone. It becomes a signal which does not require the transmission of chemicals,\u201d he said. \u201cMy research goal is to go beyond the chemicals. We want to make versions of this where you don\u2019t need this digital device so you basically just have the electronics and then the electronics could be just embedded into your mobile phone or the back of your mouth and then making infinite kinds of smell combinations once you can control the signals.\u201d The advent of wearable technologies that interact with the body, such as health monitoring devices, will result in people accepting such devices in coming years, he said. \u201c[Now] you still can\u2019t feel the experience of what it is like to be in this place in London or if we share a meal together or go to the pub together. \u201cIn the future we will be able to communicate our experience \u2013 not just communicate information but experience. \u201cI believe we will go from the information age, which is where we are now, to the age of experience.\u201d Also in development is a ring to be worn on the finger, which, using haptic (tactile) technologies, can be squeezed to send a sensation to a corresponding ring \u2013 effectively creating a greeting between partners. \u201cOnce we make these devices, the virtual world will become almost as physical as our reality,\u201d said Cheok. Scent messages While Heston Blumenthal\u2019s Fat Duck restaurant is known for implanting an iPod into shells so that diners can hear the sound of the sea during one of their fish courses, Spain\u2019s Mugaritz \u2013 also ranked among the best eateries in the world \u2013 went one step further. The head chef, Andoni Luis Aduriz, used a Scentee to simulate one of his dishes so that when someone virtually crushes herbs and spices using his restaurant\u2019s smartphone app, aromas of black pepper, sesame and saffron are emitted from the device.",

We want to make versions of this where you don\u2019t need this digital device so you basically just have the electronics and then the electronics could be just embedded into your mobile phone or the back of your mouth and then making infinite kinds of smell combinations once you can control the signals.\u201d</p> <p>The advent of wearable technologies that interact with the body, such as health monitoring devices, will result in people accepting such devices in coming years, he said.</p> <p>\u201c[Now] you still can\u2019t feel the experience of what it is like to be in this place in London or if we share a meal together or go to the pub together.</p> <p>\u201cIn the future we will be able to communicate our experience \u2013 not just communicate information but experience.</p> <p>\u201cI believe we will go from the information age, which is where we are now, to the age of experience.\u201d</p> <p>Also in development is a ring to be worn on the finger, which, using haptic (tactile) technologies, can be squeezed to send a sensation to a corresponding ring \u2013 effectively creating a greeting between partners.</p> <p>\u201cOnce we make these devices, the virtual world will become almost as physical as our reality,\u201d said Cheok.</p> <h2>Scent messages</h2> <p>While Heston Blumenthal\u2019s Fat Duck restaurant is known for implanting an iPod into shells so that diners can hear the sound of the sea during one of their fish courses, Spain\u2019s Mugaritz \u2013 also ranked among the best eateries in the world \u2013 went one step further. The head chef, Andoni Luis Aduriz, used a Scentee to simulate one of his dishes so that when someone virtually crushes herbs and spices using his restaurant\u2019s smartphone app, aromas of black pepper, sesame and saffron are emitted from the device.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first limits on mortgage lending in decades come into force this week as the Bank of England attempts to take some of the heat out of the home loan market. The restrictions on lenders come into force as official data is expected to cast economic growth since 2012 in a stronger light, which will add to deliberations in Threadneedle Street over the timing of an interest rate increase. . When Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, announced the caps on mortgage lending in June he acknowledged they would not have an immediate impact on house prices. But they are regarded as significant because they illustrate a bolder approach by policymakers in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis. Lenders are to be prevented from allocating more than 15% of new residential mortgages to individuals borrowing four and a half times their income or greater. The limit, the policymakers have acknowledged, will only have an impact if house prices rise more than 20% between now and early 2017. The restriction, imposed from Wednesday 1 October, is being introduced as data shows a stalling in house price growth. Hometrack said last week that house prices had not gone up between August and September for the first time since January last year. The Financial Policy Committee arm of the Bank \u2013 set up by the coalition to spot the next crisis \u2013 announced the intervention in June and will publish its latest view on the risks in the financial system this week. Economists are awaiting that assessment and also anticipating that data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Tuesday will paint a rosier picture of the economy from 2012 onwards than previously thought. The ONS has already published revised data for the period between 2008 and 2012, which showed the downturn was neither as deep nor long as initially estimated. The economy shrank by 6% between 2008 and 2009, less than the 7.2% contraction calculated earlier. The revisions also showed GDP returned to its pre-crisis peak in the third quarter of 2013, and not the second quarter of 2014 as estimated previously. However, the downturn remained the deepest since ONS records began in 1948. \u201cSubstantially revised GDP data are set to paint the UK\u2019s recent economic performance in a more favourable light,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight. \u201cIt has already been reported that the 2008/9 downturn was less severe and the recovery up until 2012 was better than previously reported. There seems a decent chance that growth in 2013 and 2014 so far could be revised up as well, albeit modestly.\u201d Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec, said the revisions could have implications for the Bank of England and interest rates, which have been on hold at 0.5% since March 2009. She said: \u201cIf the path of the recent downturn looks less severe and the recovery stronger, a case could be made for a less softly softly approach to rate rises when the [Bank\u2019s] Monetary Policy Committee does begin to hike.\u201d Clarke said revisions which push up the GDP level significantly in recent years could mean that estimates of spare capacity in the economy would also be brought down, bringing a rate rise closer. \u201cThat could make an \u2018on hold\u2019 decision for rates for much longer a more difficult sell,\u201d she said. Despite the revisions dating back to 1997, which require the ONS to estimate the economic contribution of illegal activities such as drugs and prostitution, economists are predicting growth in the second quarter of 2014 to remain unrevised at 0.8% on a quarterly basis, and 3.2% annually.",
