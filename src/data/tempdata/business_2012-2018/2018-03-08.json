      "bodyText": "And finally, the Guardian points out that Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t be solely blamed for the problems in global trade. In an ideal world, trade would be governed by the doctrines of Adam Smith and David Ricardo. International specialisation and comparative advantage would lead to more efficient production, stronger growth and higher living standards. Countries would unilaterally tear down the barriers to trade. But this is not the way the world actually works. Trade is managed rather than free. Politicians \u2013 Mr Trump excepted \u2013 talk the language of Smith and Ricardo but act like Alexander Hamilton, whose life has found fame in the hit musical today but is also the original 18th-century architect of US protectionism. Not everybody gains from trade, and some gain a lot more than others. So if there is a trade war Mr Trump will be not the only one to blame. Those who trumpeted the benefits of globalisation said the benefits would be fairly shared. They have not been. They said there would be help for those who lost well-paying jobs. It never arrived. More here: That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Liam Fox, Britain\u2019s secretary of state for trade, has also criticised Donald Trump\u2019s steel tariffs. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Question Time current affairs programme, Fox says the US is approaching the problems in the steel industry in the wrong way, by claiming it is a national security issue. He explains that Britain sends 5% of its steel, by tonnage, to America - but it is equal to 15% by value. That\u2019s because Britain produces very high value steel, some of which can\u2019t be sourced in the US. UK steel is also used in US military projects. It is doubly absurd that we should be caught in an investigation in national security. Protectionism and tariffs never really work, he adds.d Here\u2019s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on the tariffs news: Donald Trump pushed forward with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Thursday, arguing the levies were necessary for national security and to stop the \u201cassault on our country\u201d. Flanked by steel and aluminium workers and key staff, Trump said he had to act to stop the \u201cdecimation of entire communities\u201d and insisted there would be a very fair process as the administration used the next 15 days to negotiate exemptions with allies. Canada and Mexico will be exempted. \u201cSteel is steel,\u201d said Trump. \u201cWithout steel you don\u2019t have a country.\u201d More here: The first market reaction to the tariff announcement has come in Australia where the ASX200 benchmark is up 0.13%, or 8 points, to 5,946 in the first few minutes of trading. Australia is one of the countries hoping to be granted an exemption from the levies, although US steel imports from the land down under accounts for only 1% of the total and are worth around US$200m. There could be a stiffer test of investor resolve elsewhere in Asia Pacific. Japan supplies nearly 5% of US imports, for example, and South Korea nearly 10%. Both could claim to be equally sound allies of the US and may also hope to have the impact somehow watered down. Nikkei futures are pointing upwards. With this in mind, Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney reckons that: Trading in the Asia Pacific region today will likely range from quiet to listless. Despite the announcement of new tariff protection for US industry the real intent of the sanctions, and their impact, is not clear. Markets will await further details and important data due tonight. European Aluminium, a trade body, fear that Europe will suffer from these tariffs, even if European exports into America are ultimately excluded. That\u2019s because more excess capacity could be dumped on Europe\u2019s r side of the Atlantic. Gerd G\u00f6tz, Director General of European Aluminium, explains: \u201cThe US measures hit us where it hurts most. The European aluminium value chain is already under enormous pressure due to unsustainable Chinese overcapacities. The imposed tariff and influx of additional non-European aluminium could have severe economic consequences for SME\u2019s in countries such as Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden and Central and East European countries.\u201d \u201cUnilateral measures such as the US tariffs will not effectively address Chinese overcapacities. This global challenge can only be managed effectively through a global and long-term solution based on multilateral rules and common enforcement like a Global Aluminium Forum within G20,\u201d I neglected to mention earlier, sorry, but Wall Street ended the day higher after Donald Trump\u2019s announcement. The Dow closed 93 points higher, or up 0.38%, at 24,895. The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.45% while the Nasdaq rose by 0.5%. So a modest set of gains, as investors expressed relief that Canada and Mexico weren\u2019t included in the new tariffs. These tariffs create a new test for Britain\u2019s fabled Special Relationship. If Mexico and Canada can get a free pass, surely the UK deserves one too? The Unite union is pushing Theresa May to act fast to protect jobs. Their national officer for steel, Tony Brady, says: \u201cWhile Mexico and Canada have secured exemptions it appears the UK has not. Steel workers and manufacturing communities who have battled to save the British steel industry over recent years will be looking to prime minister Theresa May to vigorously fight their corner and ensure job destroying tariffs are not slapped on UK steel in the coming weeks. Anything less would be a betrayal to steel workers and their families and deprive US manufacturers of specialist UK steel. France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, says Europe will agree an \u2018appropriate response\u2019 to these tariffs. Yesterday, the EC singled out US peanut butter, orange juice and bourbon as likely candidates for retaliatory tariffs.... The proclamation on steel and aluminium tariffs makes the front page of Friday\u2019s Financial Times. They focus on the last-minute softening of the move, to exempt Mexico and Canada. Donald Trump formally adopted new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Thursday while allowing US allies to apply for exemptions, a sign of growing concern in Washington that the president was alienating America\u2019s closest international partners. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross has told CNBC that America needs to impose broad tariffs, to prevent China circumventing them. Ross claimed: \u201cChina has been very clever at transshipping products through other countries and dislodging domestic demand in other countries, which causes their producers to dump on us.\u201d \u201cSo the reason we have to go on a broader basis is to deal with the problems of transshipment and the problems of displacement.\u201d Senator John McCain has also criticised the tariffs, saying they will cost jobs, hurt the economy and damage relations with America\u2019s allies. McCain also disputes the \u2018national security\u2019 justification, saying it isn\u2019t backed up by evidence. He says it could actually backfire: According to the Department of Defense, U.S. military requirements for steel and aluminum each represent only about three percent of U.S. production. The Department of Defense assesses that its programs are able to acquire all the steel and aluminum necessary to meet national defense requirements. In fact, by potentially triggering significant increases in the price of steel and aluminum, President Trump\u2019s new tariffs could harm our national defense by raising the cost of production for critical military systems needed to sustain the United States\u2019 comparative military advantage against our adversaries, from ships, to armored vehicles, to fighter aircraft. There is some relief that Donald Trump has softened his stance on tariffs, by giving Canada and Mexico a free pass. This could calm worries of a full-blown trade war breaking out. Economist Shane Oliver of AMP Capital says: Top Republican Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, has criticised the decision to impose tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminum. Ryan warns that it could have \u2018unintended consequences\u2019 (that\u2019s code for cost jobs and hurt growth). He welcomes the decision to exempt Canada and Mexico, but says other American allies should be included. And on China, Ryan agrees that \u201cbad trade practices\u201d are occurring, but believes targeted measures would work better: Donald Trump has given his strongest hint yet that Australia will be exempt from the US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, but did not outline any details. During the formal announcement of the tariffs, he made strong hints that Australia would be given special consideration. \u201cWe\u2019re are going to be very fair, we\u2019re going to be very flexible, but we\u2019re going to protect the American worker,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re negotiating with Mexico, we\u2019re negotiating with Canada. We have a very close relationship with Australia. We have a trade surplus with Australia. Great country, long-term partner. We\u2019ll be doing something with them. We\u2019ll be doing something with some other countries.\u201d The US is not a major market for Australian steel \u2013 it accounts for only about 0.8% of Australia\u2019s steel exports and about 1.5% of aluminium exports \u2013 but the tariffs have triggered wider fears of a trade war which could affect Australia\u2019s trade-exposed economy and that of its largest trading partners, including China. In the UK, union leaders are pushing the British government to ask for an exemptions to these tariffs. Gareth Stace, UK Steel Director, says: It is of course promising to note that flexibility may be provided by the US administration to grant national exemptions on national security grounds and it is vital that the EU and UK authorities now do all they can to deliver this. Stace also worries that excess steel could now be dumped in Europe, rather than sold into America. We must ensure our market is not now destabilised by millions of tonnes of steel diverted away from the US to the EU. We trust and hope that the UK Government will support such measures in due course.\u201d Now for the backlash! Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has announced he will introduce a law to undo these tariffs. Reuters has the details: US Republican Senator Jeff Flake said on Thursday he would introduce a law to nullify President Donald Trump\u2019s aluminum and steel tariffs, which Trump finalized in a proclamation earlier in the day. The Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin Hatch, also criticized the tariffs but said he would work with the White House to \u201cmitigate the damage.\u201d President Trump has one last message for Beijing, as he leaves the room. He says America will hopefully have a great relationship with China, but something has to be done about the trade deficit. He seems to suggest this deficit is $500bn ( Trump then does the official signing... Oops! There\u2019s a moment of levity, as the president of a local steel union, Scott Sarge, thanks president Trump for implementing these tariffs. Trump, showing his people skills, tells Sarge that his father Herman will be looking down proudly. Oh he\u2019s still alive, Scott insists, as the room cracks up. He\u2019s even more proud of you then, replies the president quickly. Nice save.... We\u2019re now hearing from the US steel workers who are attending today\u2019s proclamations. Dustin Stephens from Kentucky explains that his factory is only running at 40% capacity. He\u2019s confident that they can move back to full capacity. Some of the countries who treat America the worst on trade and military relationships like to say they are our allies, Trump says - a remark that might worry Europrean politicians. President Trump cites this tweet from technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, showing how China currently has higher tariffs than America: We are pushing for more reciprocal tax programs in future, Trump says. Importantly, President Trump says he is open to modifying or removing the tariffs, as long as countries can prove that they don\u2019t threaten America\u2019s national security. He also confirms that the tariffs don\u2019t begin for 15 days, while the US checks who treats it fairly and who is paying their bills (a reference to military spending). Trump also confirms that he\u2019ll hold off on tariffs for Canada and Mexico. And on China, he pledges that the trade deficit (which jumped last year) will fall. Donald Trump says he is delivering on one of his most important campaign pledges. Previous politicians have let people down, he says, by not protecting the US steel and aluminum industry. Factories were \u201cleft to rot and to rust\u201d, communities turned into ghost towns. That betrayal is now over, he adds. Trump says that his tariffs are already having an effect. He points out that US Steel yesterday announced it will reopen a steel furnace at its site at Granite City, Illinois. That\u2019s happening all over the country, he continues. Trump says Century Aluminum will reopen a plant to create military-grade aluminum facility. It\u2019s official. Donald Trump confirms that the US is taking action to correct the \u201ctravesty\u201d of unfair steel and aluminum dumping on the American market. He is, as expected, imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports, and 10% on aluminum. If you want to avoid these tariffs, Trump continues, you should set up your steel plant in America - and also benefit from his tax cuts. Donald Trump has arrived. He pays tribute to the steel workers, saying they are the backbone of the US...and one of the reasons he\u2019s here in the White House. Steel is steel, he continued. If you don\u2019t have steel, you don\u2019t have a country. A group is assembling in the White House, ready for the proclamation to be signed. Treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin and Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross are there, along with a group of US steel workers. A government official has confirmed to Reuters that Donald Trump\u2019s import tariffs on steel and aluminum will start in 15 days with initial exemptions for Canada and Mexico and the possibility of alternatives for other nations The Mexican stock market has jumped by almost 1% - on relief that Mexico will get an \u2018indefinite exemption\u2019 from the steel and aluminum tariffs (according to AP). Canada\u2019s market is also rising, up 0.5%. UK MP Stephen Kinnock, whose constituency in South Wales includes Britain\u2019s Port Talbot steel works, argues that Donald Trump\u2019s tweets will hurt America\u2019s economy (and the UK). The US stock market is also pushing higher. The Dow is up 73 points, or 0.3%, at 24,875, having fallen into the red earlier today. The Canadian dollar has jumped against the US dollar, shrugging off its earlier losses. Traders are welcoming AP\u2019s report that Canada will be exempt from the tariffs. AP are also reporting that other countries can make their case to be spared these tariffs. Form an orderly queue.... Newsflash: Associated Press are reporting that Canada and Mexico have got an indefinite exemption on the new tariffs. For other countries, they\u2019ll start in 15 days, apparently. At the today\u2019s cabinet meeting, Donald Trump told reporters that his steel and aluminum tariffs would be flexible. The president explaines: \u201cI\u2019m sticking with 10 and 25 (percent) initially. I\u2019ll have a right to go up or down, depending on the country, and I\u2019ll have a right to drop out countries or add countries.\u201d That should keep everyone on their toes. It\u2019s also the sort of unilateral approach that ECB president Mario Draghi criticised today. The president has tweeted some photos from his cabinet meeting: Frankly, it\u2019s too male for International Women\u2019s Day. Fortunately the president has Melania on hand to redress the balance. She\u2019ll be presenting the International Women of Courage Award to 120 women from more than 65 countries. It\u2019s on! The White House has updated President Trump\u2019s daily schedule, adding that he \u201cwill sign the Section 232 Proclamations on Steel and Aluminum Imports at 3:30PM ET\u201d. That\u2019s 8.30pm UK time. Anticipation is building as we wait to see exactly what Donald Trump does in two and a half-hours time. Despite the criticism, the president is expected to press on and announce new tariffs on steel and aluminum. metals imports. But he\u2019s already hinted that \u2018friends\u2019 will get special treatment. My colleague Dominic Rushe has the latest: Donald Trump on Thursday looked set to push forward with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, a plan that threatens to undermine decades of detente in international trade. The president will meet metal industry executives and workers at the White House on Thursday afternoon to discuss the controversial levies. Officials from China and Europe have threatened retaliation if Trump goes ahead with his plan. \u201cLooking forward to 3.30pm meeting today at the White House,\u201d the president wrote on Twitter before the meeting. \u201cWe have to protect &amp; build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military.\u201d Trump\u2019s plan is to impose a 25% tariff on imports of steel, and a 10% tariff on aluminium. The initial plan was for a global levy, although it now appears that Australia, Canada and Mexico and other countries will be exempted. Other exceptions for some US companies may also be allowed. The London stock market has closed higher, as investors cling to hopes that a trade war can be averted. The FTSE 100 index of top shares ended 45 points higher at 7,203, up 0.6%. Mario Draghi\u2019s trenchant criticism of unilateral trade actions has caused a stir. Paul Hannon of the Wall Street Journal says it was a remarkable blunt comment from a central banker: David Lamb, head of dealing at FEXCO Corporate Payments, says Draghi gave a clear warning of the dangers of trade wars: \u201cHow very European. Mario Draghi\u2019s retort to Donald Trump\u2019s swaggering trade war rhetoric was a rhetorical question \u2013 if you slap tariffs on your friends, who are your enemies? \u201cThe short answer, of course, is everyone. And the ECB chief was keen to stress that starting a trade war is a zero sum game. With no winners, only losers. \u201cHe also aimed an economist\u2019s barb at the US President \u2013 reminding Mr Trump that previous trade wars have typically led to a strengthening of the Dollar. \u201cWith US exporters finally reaping the benefits of a softer Greenback, they need a resurgent Dollar like they need a hole in the head. Katie Martin of the FT says Draghi brought some much-needed maturity to the debate. Mario Draghi ducked the question on what makes a good ECB president. But he could have cited the ability to talk down your currency. The ECB president successfully downplayed the ECB\u2019s decision to drop its pledge to boost its asset-purchase scheme if needed, calling it a \u2018backward looking\u2019 and \u2018unanimous\u2019 move. This has persuaded the markets that the ECB hasn\u2019t suddenly turned hawkish - so traders have sent the euro down against the dollar (down 0.5% to $1.235). That\u2019s good for eurozone exports, and inflationary pressures. And finally... Q: Should we throw away the old economics books and come up with a new way of measuring inflation? Draghi says this was a popular idea a year ago [when inflation had been wallowing below zero]. Some people thought the ECB should either cut its inflation target to zero (admitting defeat), or raise it to 4% (to force a change in inflation expectations). In what looks like another pop at Donald Trump, Mario Draghi has also warned that financial deregulation could be a threat to the world economy. Q: As it\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day, isn\u2019t it a shame that the ECB is appointing a man, Spain\u2019s Luis de Guindos, as its new vice-president? ECB chief Mario Draghi confirms that the governing council approved de Guindos\u2019s appointment today, saying he\u2019ll be a \u201cvery, very good colleague\u201d. But he also admits that the gender balance at the ECB should be improved \u201cat all levels\u201d. Draghi says that the Bank is \u201cworking on improving our gender situation\u201d, and reveal that progress has been slower than hoped. In 2013, the Bank set explicit targets on gender balance for the first time - and it is currently falling short. At the end of last year, 27% of management position were held by women, compared to an interim target of 29% For the most senior roles, 17% were held by women against an interim target of 24% Draghi says: So we\u2019ve got to do some work here. The ECB is now asking headhunters to focus on gender in the recruitment process, and encouraging business managers to keep vacancies open until the objective is reached. Recruiting panels will now have \u201ca considerable presence of women\u201d, he explains: Often there are unconscious biases that play a role, and that\u2019s why its necessary to ensure a much more significant presence of women on the recruitment panels. Asked about support for eurosceptic parties in Italy, Draghi says that the euro is irreversible. ECB president Draghi also criticises politicians around the world for not doing more to tackle inequality. He says: If there is one aspect where policies, all over the world, have been insufficient, it was to take care of distributional consequences of polices that were positive for growth but not necessarily for equity. Asked about last Sunday\u2019s Italian elections, Draghi warns \u201cprotracted instability\u201d could undermine confidence, and thus growth. Q: Should you make your guidance more explicit, to prevent a market panic similar to the one in the US recently? Draghi says last month\u2019s market turmoil was triggered by unexpectedly strong wage data - which made traders rethink the likely pace of US interest rate rises. We don\u2019t have such robust wage growth in the eurozone, so there\u2019s not the same risk. Q: What has changed in the last seven weeks to lead the ECB to drop its easing bias today? Draghi points to the latest (small) growth upgrade, which confirmed the ECB\u2019s existing confidence. Q: How could an ECB president with a different approach to QE take the central bank on a different path? Your questions suggest I\u2019m going to leave tomorrow, Draghi replies, mock-hurtly. I\u2019ll be around for a while yet, he insists (until 31st October 2019, I think). Q: After six years in the job, what do you think are the most important skills to be ECB president? Easy question, Draghi smiles. \u201cI let others judge\u201d. [Draghi\u2019s term ends in late 2019, so speculation over his successor is building] Asked about the Italian economy, Draghi says that fiscal consolidations is particularly important in countries which have high debts (such as Italy) Mario Draghi says there are three questions when assessing the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs Will there be retaliations? How will the exchange rate react? In the past, the dollar has appreciated, but it could be different this time The effect on confidence - this can be very difficult to assess. If it\u2019s negative, then that\u2019s a negative impact on inflation and output. Asked about trade, Mario Draghi explains that Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans are a concern, for two reasons. Draghi says that the immediate spillover effects of the trade measures won\u2019t be that big. But that\u2019s not the problem. Whatever convictions one has about trade.... we are convinced that disputes should be discussed and resolved in a multilateral framework. Unilateral decisions are dangerous. Also, there is a certain worry about the state of international relations, he continues. If you put tariffs against your allies, one wonders who the enemies are. Victory cannot be declared yet on inflation, says Draghi, in response to another question. Q: Are the Latvian authorities infringing central bank independence, through their investigation into Latvia\u2019s central bank chief Ilmars Rimsevics (who was detained under a bribery probe last month)? Draghi says the ECB is sending a letter to the European Court of Justice about the issue. We are asking for clarification on whether the security measures imposed on the Latvia central bank governor have had the effect of relieving him from office, and whether they comply with European law, he adds. On to questions. Q: Why has the ECB dropped its promise to expand its asset-purchase scheme if needed? Draghi says that promise had been added to the ECB\u2019s monthly statement back in 2016, when the situation was very different. He also points out that the ECB has kept its other pledge -- to run its asset purchases until September 2018 \u2018or beyond, if necessary\u2019. The decision to change the language was unanimous, Draghi reveals. Draghi ends his statement by calling for the implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries to be substantially stepped up. He also calls for \u2018specific and decisive\u2019 action to complete Europe\u2019s banking union. The ECB has revised down its forecast for inflation in 2019, from 1.5% to 1.4%. It still expects inflation to be just 1.4% in 2018, rising to 1.7% in 2020. Encouragingly, Mario Draghi says that eurozone growth will growth will expand by a somewhat faster pace than earlier expected. The ECB staff have revised up their growth forecasts for 2018, but they remain unchanged for 2019 and 2002. Here are the new forecasts: 2.4% in 2018 (up from 2.3% in December) 1.9% in 2019 (unchanged) 1.7% in 2020 (unchanged) But Draghi also warns that growth could be threatened by various downside risks, including protectionism. That\u2019s a clear warning that a trade war would hurt the eurozone\u2019s recovery. A timely warning, as Donald Trump is expected to sign off his steel and aluminium tariffs in a few hours time. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi has arrived for his press conference to explain today\u2019s monetary policy decisions. He confirms that the ECB\u2019s Governing Council left interest rates unchanged, and expects them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases. On non-standard monetary policy measures (the QE bond-buying scheme), Draghi says they will run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, and until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation towards its inflation target. But as already flagged up, Draghi does not mention the ECB\u2019s previous pledge to expand QE if needed. It\u2019s been dropped from the statement. The European Central Bank is moving towards ending its stimulus programme altogether, in around a year\u2019s time, says Danielle Haralambous of the Economist Intelligence Unit: Ranko Berich of Monex Europe says Europe\u2019s economic recovery means the ECB didn\u2019t need to promise to do more QE if needed. ING\u2019s Carsten Brzeski thinks the hawkish members of the governing council are gaining momentum (that includes Germany\u2019s Jens Weidmann, a candidate to succeed Mario Draghi) Jon Ferro of Bloomberg points out that the ECB is still rather dovish, and will remain so until inflation gets back close to 2% (it\u2019s just 1.2% today). This is the phrase which has vanished from the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy statement: If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, the Governing Council stands ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. By removing it today, the ECB is signalling to the markets that it won\u2019t boost its bond-buying scheme - which is buying \u20ac30bn of bonds each month until September (at least). Mike Bird of the Wall Street Journal has highlighted how the ECB has changed its position: The euro has jumped against the US dollar, clawing back its early losses: BREAKING: The European Central Bank has left interest rates across the eurozone unchanged, as expected. That means the headline cost of borrowing stays at zero, a record low. More importantly, it has dropped its pledge to enlarge its stimulus programme, if the eurozone economic outlook deteriorates. Previously, the ECB has given an explicit pledge to extend its quantitative easing bond-buying programme, if needed. That language has now vanished from today\u2019s statement from the governing council. Instead, the ECB simply says: Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. This is a sign that the ECB is moving, slowly, towards ending its massive stimulus programme.... More to follow. Breaking: It looks like Donald Trump will be signing the order to implement steel and aluminium tariffs later today: (That\u2019s 8.30pm UK time). US media have reported that steel and aluminum workers are being flown to Washington for the event. But what does \u201cgreat flexibility\u201d mean? It\u2019s probably a hint that Canada and Mexico will be exempt (assuming a deal is reached over NAFTA). Europe will be hoping that it also counts as a \u2018real friend\u2019 -- given the close ties between NATO members, for example. Over in Westminster, the UK government\u2019s confidential Brexit impact assessment reports have been published (this is the report that leaked recently). It outlines various scenarios for the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU and beyond after Brexit; worryingly, all scenarios shows an adverse effect on the UK economy, and damage to key industries. Andy Sparrow has full details in his Politics liveblog. Sky News\u2019s Faisal Islam has been tweeting the key charts: If Jamie Dimon is right about Trump\u2019s tariffs creating a \u2018Pandora\u2019s box of problems\u2019, what might crawl out of it? Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers reckons there are two possible scenarios - one in which other countries let the US get away with, and one where they retaliate. Here they are: Benign scenario \u2013 A one-off crowd-pleasing move by Trump: \u201cSo far, US economic policy under Trump has focused on growth-enhancing measures to decrease regulation and reduce taxes. This lurch towards populism is something we have seen before with promises of a border wall and Border Adjustment Tax - but which has never truly materialised despite the heavy rhetoric. The key is whether other countries take this as a one-off, crowd-pleasing move by Trump and do not participate to create a vicious cycle. Merkel\u2019s fourth term confirmation is a welcome development in this context, and China\u2019s stance will be equally important. If both of these key blocs do not over-react, there is a strong possibility that this ends with steel and aluminium. These are both insignificant when it comes to the state of the global economy, but still useful ammunition as an over-charged rhetoric.\u201d Negative scenario \u2013 full blown trade war: \u201cThis scenario was last in play right after Trump\u2019s election in November 2016, when fears of a China-US trade war came into focus. At that time, the Trump administration did not follow up on its strong pre-election rhetoric and markets started focusing on his policy views around lower taxes and reduced regulations. However, with tariffs on steel and aluminium, we now have a concrete measure and the two worrying elements of this policy move are the domino effects of a tit-for-tat vicious cycle, coupled with negative signalling when it comes to US-China trade relations. What puts some additional weight to the probability of this scenario is the direct involvement of two trade hawks, Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, as the driving force behind this policy shift, which now seems to be offsetting the positives coming from the departure of Steve Bannon from the Trump administration.\u201d Another front cover for Donald Trump\u2019s bathroom wall: Here\u2019s our news story about the slump in profits at John Lewis: And here\u2019s some reaction: Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer are down 1.8%, while Dixons Carphone have lost 3%. Bloomberg have helpfully created some video clips of Jamie Dimon discussing tariffs.... Breaking: Jamie Dimon, the head of banking giant JP Morgan has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Speaking on Bloomberg TV right now, Dimon says that \u201cwe don\u2019t believe in these tariffs\u201d. He agrees that global trade needs reforms, but fears that Trump\u2019s plan could hurt the economy and trigger retaliations. Dimon, who has previously backed Trump policies such as tax reforms, says: There are serious issues around trade. WTO needs to get its act together and get a little more ambitious about fixing some of these problems, but I think tariffs is the wrong way to go about it. There may be more, there may be retaliations, it kinda opens up a whole Pandora\u2019s Box of additional problems.... It could escalate and it could hurt growth\u201d. Business leaders, Dimon continues, would rather see the US set out its strategy on trade properly, and negotiate with other countries in an organised fashion. Then, if you don\u2019t get what you want, you take action. Dimon also says the resignation of Gary Cohn as Trump\u2019s top economic advisor is \u201cterrible\u201d. He knows how an economy runs, he know how to make it run better for all Americans, and he\u2019s not there, Dimon adds. Just in: Workers at UK retail chain John Lewis are getting their smallest bonus in decades, after profits slumped last year. John Lewis has reported its profits, before exceptional items, shrank by 21.9% in the last year. Pre-tax profits plunged 77%, to \u00a3103.9m. Its Waitrose supermarket chain was hit by falling profit margins, due to \u201cthe weaker exchange rate and commitment to competitive pricing\u201d. John Lewis is owned by its staff, or partners, who receive a percentage of each year\u2019s profits as a bonus. This year, the bonus has fallen to just 5%. Last year it was 6%, the lowest in 63 years. Sir Charlie Mayfield, Chairman of John Lewis Partnership, warns that 2018 will be tough too: We expect trading to be volatile in 2018/19, with continuing economic uncertainty and no let up in competitive intensity. We therefore anticipate further pressure on profits. It\u2019s a bad morning for Turkish assets, after Moody\u2019s slashed its credit rating last night. Moody\u2019s cited the \u201closs of institutional strength\u201d recently under President Erdogan, and the growing risk of an \u201cexternal economic shock\u201d due to Turkey\u2019s debts and current account deficit. It downgraded Turkey to Ba2 from Ba1. The lira slid against the euro, and traders also piled out of Turkish government bonds, as Fercan Yalinkilic of Bloomberg shows: European stock markets are becalmed this morning, as traders wait for this afternoon\u2019s ECB meeting - and any fresh developments over trade. In London the FTSE 100 is basically flat. Among smaller companies Countrywide, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent, has slumped by 13% after it posted a \u00a3208m loss and called 2017 \u201ca disappointing year. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says Countrywide is suffering from its own mistakes, as well as the slowdown in the UK property markets The company is paying dearly for the acquisitive growth that helped its shares climb 80% to peak at 700p just 12-months after its March 2013 IPO. The problem is that the seemingly unbreakable UK housing market finds itself under increasing pressure with buyers deterred by economic uncertainty related to Brexit and the prospect of higher interest rates, letting investors hampered by both tax changes and rate hikes, clear slowing in house price growth and of course fierce competition from cheaper on-line selling alternatives. Shares rose on China\u2019s stock market, and beyond, as its strong export data cheered traders. The CSI 300 index has closed 1% higher, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng index gained 1.5%. China has also waded into the row over steel tariffs, warning that it will take a necessary response if America begins a trade war. China\u2019s foreign minister Wang Yi said Beijing hopes to work in partnership with the US, and that a trade war would be a mistake. However, he also cautioned that China wouldn\u2019t stand by, if tariffs were imposed on steel and aluminium exports into America. Wang said: Especially given today\u2019s globalisation, choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription. The outcome will only be harmful. \u201cChina would have to make a justified and necessary response. More here: Betty Wang, senior china economist at ANZ in Hong Kong, says China is benefitting from the strong global economy. The broad-based recovery in China\u2019s major export markets could explain part of the reason why exports were still quite strong. But Xia Le, chief Asia economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, warns that Donald Trump\u2019s plans for new tariffs could derail Chinese growth. \u201cGlobal demand remains robust and the economies of the U.S. and Europe are expanding, that\u2019s the biggest boost for Chinese exports. \u201cThe risk of a trade war in which Trump increases tariffs for a broader scope of products seems to be rising.\u201d China has spiced up the growing debate over trade wars by posting its biggest jump in exports in three years. Chinese exports jumped by a blistering 44.5% in February, smashing forecasts of a 13% gain, and up from 11.1% in January. It\u2019s the biggest jump since early 2015. Imports, though, were more modest - rising by just 6.3%. This data can be distorted by currency fluctuations, and seasonal factors (factories shut down at various times for the Lunar New Year). But the broad pattern is pretty clear. Some experts would argue that strong Chinese exports show that the world economy is in good heath. But these figures could also used by protectionist voices to argue that China is getting an unfair deal, boosting its trade at the expense of others. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: This morning\u2019s Chinese trade data are only likely to reinforce the US administration\u2019s perception of unfair trade as Chinese exports were seen to show a rise 44.5% in February, the best performance in over two years. Rather than show that the global economy appears to be in fairly good health, they are likely to be used as further evidence by President Trump\u2019s trade hawks that his current policy is appropriate. I\u2019ll pull some reaction together now. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. All eyes are on the European Central Bank today, as Mario Draghi and colleagues meet to set monetary policy across the eurozone and release their latest economic forecasts on growth and inflation. As usual, Draghi\u2019s press conference will be the main event. He\u2019ll be asked whether the ECB is considering ending its huge bond-buying stimulus programme, and will probably get a few questions about Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and the Italian election deadlock too. Konstantinos Anthis of ADS Securities research says: Today the focus will be on the European Central Bank rate decision and Mario Draghi\u2019s thoughts on the progress of the Euro area. Investors are eager to find out whether the head of the ECB is ready to start tweaking the bank\u2019s forward guidance and prepare market participants for the gradual unwinding of their QE program. There\u2019s a debate between analysts on whether Draghi will want to introduce changes to his rhetoric today or instead hold off until early summer. Investors are still worrying about the dangers of a global trade war. However, the markets are a little calmer today after press secretary Sarah Sanders suggested that some countries could be granted an exemption from looming tariffs on steel and aluminium. Sanders told reporters: \u201cThere are potential carve-outs for Canada and Mexico based on national security, and possibly other countries as well\u201d. But with Europe threatening countermeasures, and various WTO members alarmed by Trump\u2019s plans, the situation is still unclear. In the City, outsourcing group G4S, estate agent Countrywide and takeaway group Domino\u2019s Pizza are all reporting results.

Not everybody gains from trade, and some gain a lot more than others. So if there is a trade war Mr Trump will be not the only one to blame. Those who trumpeted the benefits of globalisation said the benefits would be fairly shared. They have not been. They said there would be help for those who lost well-paying jobs.

This lurch towards populism is something we have seen before with promises of a border wall and Border Adjustment Tax - but which has never truly materialised despite the heavy rhetoric. The key is whether other countries take this as a one-off, crowd-pleasing move by Trump and do not participate to create a vicious cycle. Merkel\u2019s fourth term confirmation is a welcome development in this context, and China\u2019s stance will be equally important. If both of these key blocs do not over-react, there is a strong possibility that this ends with steel and aluminium. These are both insignificant when it comes to the state of the global economy, but still useful ammunition as an over-charged rhetoric.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><em>Negative scenario \u2013 full blown trade war:</em></strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThis scenario was last in play right after Trump\u2019s election in November 2016, when fears of a China-US trade war came into focus. At that time, the Trump administration did not follow up on its strong pre-election rhetoric and markets started focusing on his policy views around lower taxes and reduced regulations. However, with tariffs on steel and aluminium, we now have a concrete measure and the two worrying elements of this policy move are the domino effects of a tit-for-tat vicious cycle, coupled with negative signalling when it comes to US-China trade relations. What puts some additional weight to the probability of this scenario is the direct involvement of two trade hawks, Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro, as the driving force behind this policy shift, which now seems to be offsetting the positives coming from the departure of Steve Bannon from the Trump administration.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5aa122ade4b0183c44a25904\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-08T11:47:06.772Z\">11.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Another front cover for Donald Trump\u2019s bathroom wall:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tom_nuttall/status/971712734550208512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This week&#39;s cover. <a href=\"https://t.co/sX7Bs4z7mZ\">pic.twitter.com/sX7Bs4z7mZ</a></p>&mdash; Tom Nuttall (@tom_nuttall) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_nuttall/status/971712734550208512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5aa1135ce4b0ec321c26b927\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-03-08T10:43:45.655Z\">10.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our news story about the slump in profits at John Lewis:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/08/john-lewis-cuts-staff-bonuses-as-profits-dive-77-percent-weaker-pound-waitrose\">John Lewis cuts staff bonuses as profits dive 77%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here\u2019s some reaction:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DharshiniDavid/status/971697347402043392\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Is the party over for   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnlewisretail?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@johnlewisretail</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waitrose?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@waitrose</a> ?

      "bodyText": "The future of the chair of one of Britain\u2019s most influential business groups was hanging in the balance on Thursday night amid allegations that she made bullying and racist comments about staff. Members of the council of the Institute of Directors were locked in a meeting to consider claims made against the business lobby group\u2019s chair, Barbara Judge, 71, who is facing 41 allegations, which also include sexism claims. The meeting, chaired by Dame Joan Stringer, the IoD\u2019s senior independent council member, began at 2pm and continued into the evening. Lady Judge told the Times on Wednesday night that she had \u201cvoluntarily decided to step aside temporarily from my role as chair and contest these allegations and the flawed process conducted so far\u201d. She said the investigation had not given her the opportunity to respond to the claims. The investigation, which had been commissioned by Stringer, is understood to have begun three months ago. Judge, who has one of the longest CVs in the City, also sits on the board of the charity Dementia UK. The charity said it was made aware of the allegations against her, on Thursday morning, and that while the claims did not relate to her role at Dementia UK, the charity was \u201cnaturally concerned about the allegations\u201d and was \u201ccarrying out an urgent review of the situation\u201d. The IoD said a full investigation had been commissioned after its human resources department was \u201cmade aware of a number of allegations from staff members concerning the conduct of non-executive members of our board\u201d. The inquiry was conducted by the law firm Hill Dickinson. The detailed report and its findings were being discussed at the IoD council meeting. The report, according to the Times, found that Judge made racist statements about staff, such as \u201cblacks can get aggressive\u201d. She is also alleged to have bullied her assistant and reduced her to tears on several occasions. She also allegedly told the IoD\u2019s director general, according to the Times, that \u201cthe problem is we have one black and we have one pregnant woman [on the IoD\u2019s secretariat] and that is the worst combination we could possibly have\u201d. In October 2016 Judge claimed long maternity breaks were bad for women, and suggested those taking a year off were at risk of losing their jobs. She told the Wealth Management Association\u2019s forum Women in Wealth: \u201cMy mother used to say, when a baby is born it needs to be fed, bathed and diapered. An 18-year-old girl can do that. Your job is to get the money to pay the 18-year-old girl. When you have to be there is when the child gets smarter than the nanny.\u201d She told the forum: \u201cI know it\u2019s counter-cultural but I think long maternity breaks are bad for women. A friend of mine worked at Reckitt Benckiser and wanted to take a year off to look after her adopted baby. I told her \u2018you\u2019re mad, you have a great job and, trust me, you\u2019ll lose it if you take a year off\u2019. She took 12 months\u2019 maternity leave, she returned to work \u2013 and then three months later the financial crisis hit. The first job they cut was hers. Why? Because her boss had been doing her job for a year. They realised they didn\u2019t need her.\u201d A New York-born former banker and corporate lawyer, Judge became the IoD\u2019s first female chair in 2015. She chaired the UK\u2019s Pension Protection Fund between 2010 and 2016, and is also a former chair of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. She was awarded a CBE in 2010. She told the Financial Times in 2014 that her greatest disappointment was not having a daughter, saying \u201cthat\u2019s why I\u2019m so committed to helping other women\u201d. The IoD, founded in 1903 on Pall Mall, London, promotes good corporate governance practices and recently called for tougher rules on executive pay.",

      "body": "<p>The future of the chair of one of Britain\u2019s most influential business groups was hanging in the balance on Thursday night amid allegations that she made bullying and racist comments about staff.</p> <p>Members of the council of the Institute of Directors were locked in a meeting to consider claims made against the business lobby group\u2019s chair, Barbara Judge, 71, who is facing 41 allegations, which also include sexism claims. </p> <p>The meeting, chaired by Dame Joan Stringer, the IoD\u2019s senior independent council member, began at 2pm and continued into the evening.</p> <p></p> <p>Lady Judge told the Times on Wednesday night that she had \u201cvoluntarily decided to step aside temporarily from my role as chair and contest these allegations and the flawed process conducted so far\u201d. She said the investigation had not given her the opportunity to respond to the claims.</p> <p>The investigation, which had been commissioned by Stringer, is understood to have begun three months ago.</p> <p>Judge, who has one of the longest CVs in the City, also sits on the board of the charity Dementia UK. The charity said it was made aware of the allegations against her, on Thursday morning, and that while the claims did not relate to her role at Dementia UK, the charity was \u201cnaturally concerned about the allegations\u201d and was \u201ccarrying out an urgent review of the situation\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The IoD said a full investigation had been commissioned after its human resources department was \u201cmade aware of a number of allegations from staff members concerning the conduct of non-executive members of our board\u201d.</p> <p>The inquiry was conducted by the law firm Hill Dickinson. The detailed report and its findings were being discussed at the IoD council meeting. </p> <p></p> <p>The report, according to the Times, found that Judge made racist statements about staff, such as \u201cblacks can get aggressive\u201d. She is also alleged to have bullied her assistant and reduced her to tears on several occasions.</p> <p>She also allegedly told the IoD\u2019s director general, according to the Times, that \u201cthe problem is we have one black and we have one pregnant woman [on the IoD\u2019s secretariat] and that is the worst combination we could possibly have\u201d.</p> <p>In October 2016 <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/07/lady-barbara-judge-long-maternity-leave-is-bad-for-mothers/\">Judge claimed long maternity breaks were bad for women</a>, and suggested those taking a year off were at risk of losing their jobs. She told the Wealth Management Association\u2019s forum Women in Wealth: \u201cMy mother used to say, when a baby is born it needs to be fed, bathed and diapered. An 18-year-old girl can do that. Your job is to get the money to pay the 18-year-old girl. When you have to be there is when the child gets smarter than the nanny.\u201d</p> <p>She told the forum: \u201cI know it\u2019s counter-cultural but I think long maternity breaks are bad for women. A friend of mine worked at Reckitt Benckiser and wanted to take a year off to look after her adopted baby. I told her \u2018you\u2019re mad, you have a great job and, trust me, you\u2019ll lose it if you take a year off\u2019. She took 12 months\u2019 maternity leave, she returned to work \u2013 and then three months later the financial crisis hit. The first job they cut was hers. Why? Because her boss had been doing her job for a year. They realised they didn\u2019t need her.\u201d</p> <p>A New York-born former banker and corporate lawyer, Judge became the IoD\u2019s first female chair in 2015. She chaired the UK\u2019s Pension Protection Fund between 2010 and 2016, and is also a former chair of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. She was awarded a CBE in 2010.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28d1585a-98fd-11e3-a32f-00144feab7de\">She told the Financial Times</a> in 2014 that her greatest disappointment was not having a daughter, saying \u201cthat\u2019s why I\u2019m so committed to helping other women\u201d.</p> <p>The IoD, founded in 1903 on Pall Mall, London, promotes good corporate governance practices and recently called for tougher rules on executive pay.<br></p>",

For its own commemoration of International Women\u2019s Day, McDonald\u2019s overturned its logo on Twitter, Instagram and its other digital channels; supplied 100 restaurants in the US with special branded garb; and \u2013 at one franchise in California \u2013 went so far as to install a new sign. McDonald\u2019s global chief diversity officer, Wendy Lewis, said in a statement to Business Insider that the stunt was \u201cin honour of the extraordinary accomplishments of women everywhere, and especially in our restaurants\u201d. But her vow that the company was \u201ccommitted to their success\u201d was called into question by social media users who called on McDonald\u2019s to pay its employees a living wage. In response to the campaign, the British leftwing group Momentum put out a video highlighting how McDonald\u2019s low wages and zero-hours contracts meant some women workers faced poverty and homelessness. The videos, produced in collaboration with the Bakers\u2019 Union, are in support of striking McDonald\u2019s workers. \u201cThis empty McFeminism has nothing to do with women\u2019s liberation and everything to do with McDonald\u2019s attempt to sanitise its image,\u201d said Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator. \u201cIf they actually cared about women, they\u2019d pay their workers a living wage and stop forcing them onto zero hours contracts. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable that zero hours contracts at McDonald\u2019s have left women workers without enough money to feed their children \u2013 and have even made some of them homeless.\u201d Meanwhile KFC Malaysia also made an attempt to mark the day, by changing its icon from Colonel Sanders to Claudia Sanders, the founder\u2019s second wife. A representative of KFC\u2019s marketing agency, Stanley Clement from IPG Mediabrands\u2019 Society and Universal McCann, described the origin of the change thusly: \u201cThe team was looking at ways to support this, and discovered the story of Claudia Sanders, the wife of Colonel Sanders\u201d. They may have missed part of the story however. In a biography of her father, Colonel Sanders\u2019 daughter Margaret Sanders said her father originally hired Claudia to help her mother, his first wife, with housework, according to reporting from Buzzfeed. \u201cIt was evident from the beginning that her presence would create turmoil,\u201d his daughter Margaret wrote. \u201cNeither promiscuous nor a whoremonger, Father nevertheless had a libido which required a healthy, willing partner,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe found one in young Claudia.\u201d Claudia became Sanders\u2019 second wife in 1949.",

The American fast food chain was forced to temporarily close hundreds of stores after it ran out of chicken following the botched handover of its logistics contract to DHL and QSL. \u201cTo put it simply,\u201d KFC tweeted at the time, \u201cwe\u2019ve got the chicken, we\u2019ve got the restaurants, but we\u2019ve just had issues getting them together.\u201d Bidvest lost out to its rivals when the contract was put out to tender in 2017, but on Thursday it announced that it had won some of that business back, after signing a long-term agreement to supply around a third of KFC\u2019s 900 restaurants. \u201cWe are delighted to welcome KFC back to Bidvest Logistics,\u201d said its business unit director, Paul Whyte, who could not resist a dig at its rivals\u2019 failings. \u201cAs the UK\u2019s leading food service logistics specialist, we understand the complexities of delivering fresh chicken \u2026 We will provide them with a seamless return to our network.\u201d A small number of KFC outlets remain closed while others are offering a limited menu. The company said it had taken the decision to re-engage Bidvest as it tried to get \u201cback to business as usual\u201d. \u201cOur focus remains on ensuring our customers can enjoy our chicken without further disruption,\u201d said a KFC spokesman. \u201cWith that in mind, the decision has been taken in conjunction with QSL and DHL to revert the distribution contract for up to 350 of our restaurants in the north of the UK back to Bidvest Logistics. \u201cThe decision will ease pressure on DHL\u2019s Rugby depot, to help get our restaurants back to normal as quickly as possible. As its stands, over 97% of our 900 restaurants are now open for business, although there will be some limited menus before we are back to business as usual.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Rydon, the construction company that refurbished Grenfell Tower before the fire that killed 71 people, had a 50% rise in profit last year to \u00a319m and increased the salary of its highest-paid director by 8% to \u00a3459,000. Its accounts show directors decided not to set aside money to cover potential losses or expenses related to the blaze, after considering the company\u2019s position. Rydon was the lead contractor overseeing the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower between 2014 and 2016, including the installation of cut-price cladding, which was cited among factors that allowed the fire to spread rapidly. Ministers have said the polyethylene cladding used in the refurbishment did not comply with regulations, although Labour said this week that the government\u2019s chief fire safety adviser approved similar material as safe for tower blocks. Rydon\u2019s sales rose 3% to \u00a3280m for the year to the end of September, including a three-month period following the fire on 14 June. The salary of the company\u2019s highest-paid director, who was not named in the accounts, went up from \u00a3424,000 to \u00a3459,000. The company said it had been helped by low interest rates and several government initiatives aimed at increasing housebuilding. Accounting rules require companies to include a note highlighting the potential for any significant charges they may face in future, such as fines or payouts related to litigation. But Rydon did not make any financial provision for costs relating to Grenfell, despite lawyers for the victims\u2019 families saying they are considering legal action against the local government body that owned Grenfell Tower and the companies involved in the application of the external insulation system. A government-backed inquiry in December said this cladding system appeared to have accelerated the spread of the fire. In its accounts, Rydon said \u201cgiven the limited nature of the work commissioned, the approvals received in relation to it and the inter-relationship with work undertaken by other parties, no provision has been made in the accounts for any matters arising from these tragic events\u201d. In December, lawyers said social housing landlords that have been forced to remove dangerous cladding from housing blocks could sue the companies responsible if they can prove the work did not comply with regulations. The Guardian has contacted Rydon for comment.",

She worked her way through university as a model and waitress, studying medieval English history before graduating from New York University School of Law, where she described herself as \u201ca bit of a leftie\u201d. She initially worked as a corporate lawyer and became the youngest member of the US Securities and Exchange Commission at 33. She then moved to Hong Kong to work for the British merchant bank Samuel Montagu, becoming its first female director. Later Judge became the executive director of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News International and relocated to London where she founded the investment firm Private Equity Investor in the 1990s. A strong advocate of nuclear power, Judge became chair of the UK Atomic Energy Authority in 2004. During her tenure as the head of the UK\u2019s Pension Protection Fund between 2010 and 2016, she was also drafted in by Tokyo Electric Power Company to help assure the residents of Fukushima that its reactors were safe after the nuclear disaster there, and was hailed as \u201cJapan\u2019s nuclear saviour\u201d. The 71-year-old\u2019s many roles have included business ambassador on behalf of the former government department UK Trade &amp; Investment, and deputy chairman of the UK Financial Reporting Council. She was awarded a CBE in 2010 for services to the nuclear and financial services industries. However, just months after she became the Institute of Directors\u2019 first female chair in February 2015, she faced calls to quit because of her involvement with the coal company responsible for the US\u2019s worst coalmine disaster in 40 years. She sat on committees overseeing safety and corporate governance at Massey Energy when a coal dust explosion killed 29 workers in West Virginia in 2010. Before the explosion, institutional investors and union groups had said Judge, who held multiple directorships, would not be able to devote enough time to addressing Massey\u2019s safety issues. In 2016, Judge said long maternity breaks were bad for women, and suggested those taking a year off were risking losing their jobs. She took 12 days off work when her son was born. She was married to the former Conservative party fundraiser Sir Paul Judge, who died last year. She sits on the board of the charity Dementia UK and has been involved with the Royal Academy of Arts as chair of Benjamin West group atrons.",

The second formal investigation to date by the Groceries Code Adjudicator will be the first in which it can levy penalties of up to 1% of turnover. The adjudicator, Christine Tacon, said she had \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d the Co-op had breached a legally binding industry code of practice, overseen by the GCA, designed to ensure suppliers are treated fairly. In a statement, the Co-Op apologised and admitted it had \u201cfallen short\u201d. The company said it had repaid \u00a3500,000 to 110 suppliers in relation to quality control and \u201cbenchmarking charges\u201d \u2013 checking goods against other retailers\u2019 products \u2013 and was retraining staff to ensure they comply with the code of practice. The Co-op\u2019s food business has a turnover of more than \u00a37bn, which means the group could potentially face a fine of more than \u00a370m, although Tacon has previously said she prefers to push for change in industry practice rather than levy penalties. Her investigation will consider the extent, scale and impact of practices that may have resulted in suppliers\u2019 products being delisted \u2013 removed from stores \u2013 with either short notice or none at all. The investigation will cover the period between summer 2016 and summer 2017. Tacon will also look at whether the Co-Op introduced \u201ccharges without reasonable notice\u201d on suppliers. The charges related to checking the quality of goods with little notice. The adjudicator called on suppliers to come forward with evidence. \u201cIt is now important that suppliers provide me with information to help my investigation ... All information I receive will be treated with complete confidentiality,\u201d she said. The Co-op said: \u201cWe acknowledge that we have fallen short and have been discussing the two issues raised with the GCA for some months. We have already taken decisive steps in line with our commitment to ensure the fair treatment of all of our suppliers.\u201d The company said it was adjusting its systems and processes, and writing to all of its 1,500 direct suppliers to seek information on any delisting decisions they believe may have been taken without appropriate consultation. \u201cA small number of suppliers have raised concerns, which we are working through with them,\u201d the Co-op said. Jo Whitfield, the chief executive of Co-op Food, said: \u201cWe care deeply about our relationships with our suppliers and we are very sorry that in these two areas, we have failed to live up to our usual high standards. \u201cWe are already addressing the issues with the GCA and our suppliers, and we hope the investigation will help bring to light any additional cases, so that we can put these right as quickly as possible.\u201d Tacon has previously sanctioned a number of companies, but has only launched one other formal investigation. Two years ago, Tesco was forced to pay \u00a31m towards the cost of a GCA investigation that found the supermarket had deliberately delayed payments to suppliers to boost profit. At the time, Tacon did not have the power to levy a fine on Tesco.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "John Lewis Partnership (JLP) has cut its annual staff bonus to the lowest level in 64 years after profit plunged at the group, which owns Waitrose and a chain of department stores. The company said 85,000 workers, known as partners because they jointly own the business, would share a \u00a374m bonus, equivalent to 5% of annual pay. All partners, from leading executives to Saturday shelf-stackers, receive the same percentage bonus. Sir Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of JLP, said it had been a \u201cchallenging year\u201d. He blamed the downturn in profit and the staff payout \u2013 which has been cut for five years in a row \u2013 on subdued consumer demand and \u201csignificant changes to operations across the partnership, which affected many partners\u201d. Mayfield said the coming year was likely to put further pressure on profit. The bonus cut came as profit fell 77% to \u00a3103.9m in the year to the end of January. Much of the damage to the bottom line was the result of one-off charges to cover redundancy and restructuring costs. But excluding those one-off costs, profit was still down 22% to \u00a3289m. Waitrose\u2019s results were particularly poor, affected by tough competition in the supermarket business and the higher cost of goods due to the fall in the value of the pound. Waitrose said it had tried not to pass on all price rises to shoppers. It pointed to the shelf price of butter going up 36% when the cost to Waitrose had increased by 200%. Similarly, the price of British lamb and smoked salmon rose less than 5% for shoppers while the cost to Waitrose went up 25%. Mayfield said John Lewis now employs nearly 3,000 fewer people and he expected more jobs to go, but the group would be investing more to improve the experience for shoppers. \u201cThis is no time for a defensive crunch. Our whole game plan is to step up to this challenge and we\u2019ll be stepping up the pace of innovation. It\u2019s the only way to win in this market,\u201d he said. Ideas include training shop staff to promote the department stores through their personal Twitter and Instagram feeds, bringing in dozens more designers and technologists to grow own-label clothing and home ranges, and expanding a handyman service to London. The high street is facing a tough time, with House of Fraser and Debenhams planning to lose some shopfloor space as customers increasingly buy online. Rising costs and a squeeze on disposable income, as inflation outstrips wage rises, are also contributing to retailers\u2019 woes. John Lewis has continued to open stores, including a small department store in Oxford and a full-size outlet due to open later this month in the extension of the Westfield shopping centre in west London. But it has slowed expansion, cut jobs and closed some Waitrose stores. Only one Waitrose supermarket and two department stores will open this year, as the group invests more in existing outlets. Despite the lower bonus, Mayfield said John Lewis was committed to increasing pay for ordinary workers, who earn \u00a38.91 an hour on average, well above the legal minimum of \u00a37.50 an hour for over-25s. Sales at the department store chain rose just over 2% to \u00a34.84bn. Fashion, beauty and electrical goods sold well. Operating profit before one-off costs increased by 4.5% to nearly \u00a3255m. Waitrose sales were up 1.8% to \u00a36.75bn. But its operating profit plunged 32% to \u00a3172m.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The latest GDP figures released yesterday reveal the Australian economy continues to be stuck in the post-GFC malaise of low economic growth , and where government spending and population increases are keeping the economy growing but household living standards remain stagnant. In the December quarter the economy grow by a rather middling 0.36% in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 the third worst quarterly result in the past five years: The trend result was marginally better \u2013 quarterly growth of 0.6% and year-on-year annual growth of 2.6% \u2013 which was an increase from 2.4% in the September quarter: But that is pretty small joy, given it marks 21 consecutive quarters where trend GDP growth has been below 3%, the longest such streak ever recorded \u2013 the next longest was 13 during the GFC. It means that in the past nine and a half years, there have only been four quarters of annual growth above what used to be considered the average level of 3%. Over the past five years, Australia\u2019s economy has been growing at an average of just 2.4% each year, and GDP per capita (which takes into account population growth) has averaged just 0.9% growth. Both of these levels are consistent with periods in the past where we have been in a recession. That we have not had a recession only serves to demonstrate the economic middling we are now experiencing \u2013 no busts, but little sign of a boom either, and overall slower growth than you would expect \u2013 especially given the strong employment growth last year. When we look at total calendar-year growth (which compares all economic activity over the year with the previous year) we see that we have now had 26 years of consecutive growth, but the 2.3% calendar-year growth of 2017 is the third worst during that period: When we look at the contributions to GDP growth we get an idea of why things are so weak. In the December quarter, spending by governments in effect cancelled out the impact of net exports, which detracted from growth because exports fell and imports rose. It is a continuation of the very strong impact of government consumption and investment on GDP growth over the past two years \u2013 about 40% of which come from the federal level (spending on things such as defence, the NDIS, aged care and the PBS), and 60% from the states \u2013 especially infrastructure spending. With government spending cancelling out the fall in exports, that left household consumption as the major driver of growth. We spent enough to counteract the drop in construction, but only just. So we remain an economy very much dependent upon household spending (not surprising given it accounts for nearly 60% of GDP, but even though there was a nice boost in spending in December off the back of the latest iPhone, a look at the annual growth shows just how limp our spending remains compared with previous years. In the past year, household consumption grew by just 2.9% \u2013 marking six years since it has grown by more than 3%: And there is little reason to think this is going to change any time soon. Yes, total wages grew by 4.4% over the past year \u2013 the strongest growth for six years \u2013 but that was mostly due to the strong increase in employment. It wasn\u2019t so much wages growing as more people getting a wage. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, tried to paint a nice picture of this, pointing out that \u201cone third of the through-the-year increase was driven by average wages\u201d, but that is actually a pretty poor result. Usually, average wage increases account for nearly 60% of the total wage growth. Average compensation per employee grew by just 1.3% in the past year \u2013 a pitiful amount: And worse, it means that as inflation grew by 1.9%, real average compensation per employee actually fell 0.6% in 2017. In real terms, the average compensation per employee of $19,902 is now 3.7% below the peak of March 2012, and still below the $19,358 recorded seven years ago in December 2010: Not surprisingly, in that time real household incomes have also been flat. While there was a slight improvement in the December quarter, real household incomes fell in 2017 and remain 0.1% below where they were at the 2013 election: While the numbers are not terrible \u2013 the economy is still growing, investment in machinery and equipment is improving \u2013 there is very little to crow about. At a certain point, boasting about not having experienced a recession for over a quarter of a century is going to seem pretty hollow, especially when both current economic and household income growth per capita remain at levels more associated with recessionary periods.",

Both of these levels are consistent with periods in the past where we have been in a recession.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"5 year average GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gxgC8/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That we have not had a recession only serves to demonstrate the economic middling we are now experiencing \u2013 no busts, but little sign of a boom either, and overall slower growth than you would expect \u2013 especially given the strong employment growth last year.</p> <p>When we look at total calendar-year growth (which compares all economic activity over the year with the previous year) we see that we have now had 26 years of consecutive growth, but the 2.3% calendar-year growth of 2017 is the third worst during that period:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Calendar year GDP growth - past 50 years\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/v9X1P/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When we look at the contributions to GDP growth we get an idea of why things are so weak.</p> <p>In the December quarter, spending by governments in effect cancelled out the impact of net exports, which detracted from growth because exports fell and imports rose.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contributions to GDP growth (seasonally adjusted)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/9c5in/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It is a continuation of the very strong impact of government consumption and investment on GDP growth over the past two years \u2013 about 40% of which come from the federal level (spending on things such as defence, the NDIS, aged care and the PBS), and 60% from the states \u2013 especially infrastructure spending.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of govt spending &amp; investment to GDP growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fSaHP/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>With government spending cancelling out the fall in exports, that left household consumption as the major driver of growth. We spent enough to counteract the drop in construction, but only just.</p> <p>So we remain an economy very much dependent upon household spending (not surprising given it accounts for nearly 60% of GDP, but even though there was a nice boost in spending in December off the back of the latest iPhone, a look at the annual growth shows just how limp our spending remains compared with previous years. In the past year, household consumption grew by just 2.9% \u2013 marking six years since it has grown by more than 3%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Household consumption - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3lGXZ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And there is little reason to think this is going to change any time soon.</p> <p>Yes, total wages grew by 4.4% over the past year \u2013 the strongest growth for six years \u2013 but that was mostly due to the strong increase in employment. It wasn\u2019t so much wages growing as more people getting a wage.</p> <p>The treasurer, Scott Morrison, tried to paint a nice picture of this, pointing out that \u201cone third of the through-the-year increase was driven by average wages\u201d, but that is actually a pretty poor result. Usually, average wage increases account for nearly 60% of the total wage growth.</p> <p>Average compensation per employee grew by just 1.3% in the past year \u2013 a pitiful amount:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Compensation of employees - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lDV72/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And worse, it means that as inflation grew by 1.9%, real average compensation per employee actually fell 0.6% in 2017.</p> <p>In real terms, the average compensation per employee of $19,902 is now 3.7% below the peak of March 2012, and still below the $19,358 recorded seven years ago in December 2010:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Real average compensation per employee\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1FAfd/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Not surprisingly, in that time real household incomes have also been flat. While there was a slight improvement in the December quarter, real household incomes fell in 2017 and remain 0.1% below where they were at the 2013 election:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Real household disposable income per capita\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ER9kE/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While the numbers are not terrible \u2013 the economy is still growing, investment in machinery and equipment is improving \u2013 there is very little to crow about.</p> <p>At a certain point, boasting about not having experienced a recession for over a quarter of a century is going to seem pretty hollow, especially when both current economic and household income growth per capita remain at levels more associated with recessionary periods<a href=\"xhttp://www.theguardian.com\">.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fake graph\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;Xhttp://www.theguardian.com&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Next is facing a demand for up to \u00a330m in back pay from thousands of mainly female shop-floor staff in the first major equal pay claim against a fashion retailer. More than 300 workers have registered to participate in a claim that was filed at the conciliation service Acas on Wednesday. They say they are paid \u00a37.50 an hour or an average \u00a32 an hour less than mainly male warehouse workers who they view as doing work of equal value. The warehouse staff also have access to more lucrative bonuses. The average salary loss for the group is about \u00a36,000 and it\u2019s anticipated that between 3,000 and 5,000 workers will ultimately sign up to the group claim, which could take the claim to \u00a330m. Next employs about 45,000 people in the UK, around 30,000 of whom are women working in its stores. The Next claim comes hot on the heels of a similar action against Tesco, which faces a demand for up to \u00a34bn in back pay from thousands of mainly female shop workers in what could become the UK\u2019s largest ever equal pay claim. Similar actions against Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s are also working their way through the employment tribunal process, while Morrisons also faces a potential claim as lawyers have gathered more than 200 names with the intention of approaching Acas in the near future. Lawyers acting for the Next shop assistants say that on a typical day they undertake a number of demanding tasks requiring both mental and physical agility that are comparable to tasks carried out by warehouse workers. Under employment law, those doing work of equal value, not necessarily the same work, are entitled to equal pay. Elizabeth George, head of employment at Pattinson Brewer, which is acting for the Next claimants, said arrangements at the fashion chain were \u201canother classic example of historical discrimination that has never been corrected\u201d. \u201cShop-floor work was always perceived as women\u2019s work and so thought to be worth less than work in the warehouses which was traditionally perceived as men\u2019s work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is open to Next to approach these claims differently from say, Asda. They can spend months (possibly years) fighting the claims or they can take a radically different and progressive approach and work with us to put this problem right.\u201d Next said it had not been notified by Acas and was currently unaware of any claims against it. A spokesman for the company said: \u201cThe difference between working in a warehouse and a store at Next is, however, more significant than for any of the retailers now involved in litigation. \u201cNext values all its employees, regardless of their gender, role and place of work within the business. Next is also confident that all its employees are paid legally, fairly and appropriately for the jobs they perform.\u201d George suggested more retail equal pay claims were likely to be on the way. Nearly 20,000 people are involved in the Asda case, where the latest ruling backed the shopworkers\u2019 right to compare their jobs to employees \u2013 mainly men \u2013 working in distribution centres. Asda is due to appeal against that ruling at the court of appeal in October. About 1,000 workers are involved in the Sainsbury\u2019s action. Unequal pay has also become a big battleground in the public sector, with female cleaners and dinner ladies taking legal action over claims they are paid less than binmen or male street cleaners. Birmingham city council agreed to pay more than \u00a31bn to settle the claims of tens of thousands of women, which stretch back over many years. There have also been claims against Glasgow city council, Dudley council and Wolverhampton city council.",
