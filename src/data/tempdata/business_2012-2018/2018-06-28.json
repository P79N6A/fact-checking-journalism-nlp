    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The disgraced former UBS trader Kweku Adoboli has had an application to overturn a deportation order against him rejected in the court of appeal. Thursday\u2019s ruling is the latest development in the convicted fraudster\u2019s four-year battle to overturn the order to deport him from the UK to Ghana, the country of his birth, which was issued by the Home Office on 8 July 2014 on the grounds that he is a foreign criminal. Adoboli\u2019s unauthorised trading lost the Swiss bank \u00a31.4bn. It has been described as the largest trading loss in British banking history. The 38-year-old says he considers himself to be British, having spent a large part of his life in the UK, attending Ackworth school in Yorkshire, where he was head boy, and Nottingham University before working for UBS. In 2012 he was sentenced to seven years in jail on two counts of fraud. The deportation order was served on him after he had served three and a half years of his sentence. The court of appeal judge Lord Justice Lewison refused permission for an appeal against a decision by the immigration court that upheld the Home Office deportation order against Adoboli. The decision by the upper tribunal of the immigration and asylum chamber said that although Adoboli was socially and culturally integrated into the UK, his family was in Ghana and he had not demonstrated that there would be significant obstacles to him integrating into Ghanaian society. \u201cThe public interest in deporting foreign criminals is a fixed criterion,\u201d Lewison said. He added that the case Adoboli was presenting did not raise any important points of principle or practice and dismissed his application. Adoboli represented himself and was tearful after the hearing. \u201cI\u2019m British just like anyone else,\u201d he said. He was released from prison in 2015. Foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years are automatically considered for deportation. Adoboli, the son of a UN peacekeeper, left Ghana at the age of four, lived mostly in the Middle East for several years and then settled in the UK at the age of 12. His last hope of avoiding deportation is a judicial review that he has lodged in the high court arguing that the Home Office has acted unlawfully towards him. However, Lewison said that the review had been lodged out of time and it was \u201coverwhelmingly likely\u201d that permission would be refused on that ground alone. Adoboli told the court that the stress he had experienced with the Home Office had delayed him in preparing the case. During his criminal trial, Adoboli said that UBS staff had been encouraged to take risks. The Financial Conduct Authority banned Adoboli from working in the City for life. UBS was fined \u00a329.7m for systems and control failures related to the unauthorised trading losses. In his criminal case, the sentencing judge said Adoboli was profoundly lacking in self-consciousness about his own failings and had a strong gambling streak. Adoboli told the Guardian that he was now a reformed character, devoting himself to voluntary work including giving talks to young City traders about the dangers of their risk-culture workplace, and talking to students about making the right life choices. He argued that sufficient weight had not been given to this positive contribution to British society and was hoping that he would be given a second chance now that he had turned his life around. \u201cMy contribution to society now should be balanced against the public interest in deporting me. I have had my banking licence taken away from me so could never commit a crime of this kind again. Part of the human condition is to make mistakes,\u201d he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cForeign nationals who abuse our hospitality by committing crimes in the UK should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them. All foreign nationals who are given a custodial sentence will be considered for removal and we have removed more than 42,800 foreign offenders since 2010.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A group of 50 Deliveroo couriers will share a six-figure payout from the takeaway delivery firm in a settlement of an employment rights claim. The riders, who were represented by the law firm Leigh Day, argued that they had been unlawfully denied rights, including the legal minimum wage and paid holiday, after being labelled self-employed contractors. The case was to be the latest in a string of similar employment rights claims, against Hermes, Uber, Addison Lee, City Sprint, Excel and eCourier, which have that ruled gig economy drivers and couriers have \u201cworker\u201d status with more rights than independent contractors. Annie Powell, a solicitor in Leigh Day\u2019s employment department who represented the riders, said: \u201cDeliveroo has paid out a material sum to settle these claims. In our view, this shows that Deliveroo knew that they were very likely to lose at the employment tribunal. \u201cThis settlement will make a real difference to our clients\u2019 lives. Some of the riders we represented were on the breadline, earning hundreds and in some cases thousands of pounds below the national minimum wage over the time that they worked for Deliveroo.\u201d Powell called on the company to change its practice and implement a compensation scheme for all riders on similar contracts. Deliveroo said it was pleased to have reached the settlement, which was first reported by Sky News, without an admission of liability. A spokesperson for the London-based firm said: \u201cThis settlement has no impact on Deliveroo riders or our model; and allows us to continue to focus on creating the well-paid, flexible work that our riders value. Courts have repeatedly considered Deliveroo\u2019s model and judged that riders working with us are self-employed.\u201d The settlement of the case, which was due to be heard by an employment tribunal in mid-July, comes after the high court backed a decision by the central arbitration committee, which considers union recognition cases, that Deliveroo riders were self-employed contractors. The committee concluded that because riders were able to pass on a job to a substitute, they were not obliged to provide a \u201cpersonal service\u201d and therefore could not be classified as workers. However, the high court gave the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain permission to launch a full judicial review of the workers\u2019 rights to collective bargaining based on human rights grounds. Deliveroo\u2019s hiring conditions are also to be scrutinised by MPs.",

      "bodyText": "Tesco is trialling new \u201cshop and go\u201d technology that allows customers to scan and pay for their groceries on their smartphone and then walk out of the store without visiting a till. The retailer is using staff at its Welwyn Garden City headquarters as guinea pigs for the service in a purpose-built Express convenience store on the site. Tesco has installed the app, Scan Pay Go, on the mobiles of 100 staff who are able to use it to scan barcodes and then pay for their shopping. Traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers are investing in new technology as they try to keep pace with online rival Amazon, which opened an automated convenience store in the US earlier this year. The Co-op has already introduced pay-in-the aisle technology, while Sainsbury\u2019s tested a similar app in 2017. The Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, said the technology could be rolled out across the supermarket chain but there were important aspects to consider, including whether people would simply walk out without paying. \u201cThe technology exists to do it but does the customer behaviour support it?\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIf the margin is 2%-3% you don\u2019t need to lose very much to make it unprofitable.\u201d While these initiatives could spell the beginning of the end for the supermarket checkout \u2013 fuelling fears that automation could eventually eliminate millions of retail jobs \u2013 they are seen to be attractive to the time-pressed shoppers who frequent busy city centre stores. \u201cIn our stores in central London, Manchester and Birmingham, lunchtime queues are a problem,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cAnything we can do to speed that up will be a benefit for customers.\u201d The Express store is also being used to test how shoppers cope in what is fast becoming a cashless world. Debit card payments have now overtaken cash as the most popular form of transaction in the UK for the first time, according to recent banking industry figures. Consumers used their debit cards 13.2bn times last year, up 14% compared with 2016, according to a report by UK Finance, the trade body for the UK banking and financial services sector. The number of cash transactions fell by 15% to 13.1bn in the same period. The checkouts in the Welwyn store only accept cards or other forms of digital payments. Cutting out a visit to the till means Tesco can halve the time it takes for a customer to pay and leave the store to just 45 seconds. Steve Blair, the retailer\u2019s convenience transformation director, said the cashless trial was a response to changing shopper behaviour as in some stores more than 80% were paying by card. Blair said the retailer was reinvigorating its Express chain with several initiatives designed to make the stores more appealing. \u201cThe Express environment hadn\u2019t been refreshed for some time,\u201d he said. Tesco has started playing background music in 30 stores with playlists tailored to the age profile of each outlet\u2019s shoppers. It has also introduced juice bars, which vie with bananas as the best-selling product in the revamped stores. The removal of cash would also make the 1,800 Tesco Express stores less attractive to criminals. \u201cThere are a significant amount of robberies in Express stores every week,\u201d said Blair.",

      "bodyText": "The number of restaurants in the UK has fallen for the first time in eight years as sales stagnate and costs rise. On average, two restaurants a week closed in the year to the end of March, including casual dining chains, as well as upmarket and independent establishments, according to the latest data from analysts CGA and corporate advisory firm AlixPartners. Graeme Smith, the managing director of AlixPartners, said he expected restaurant numbers to continue to drop throughout the year as large chains in particular slim down. There have already been high-profile closures by burger chain Byron, Jamie\u2019s Italian, Carluccio\u2019s, the Prezzo Group and Sir Terence Conran\u2019s Albion restaurants, but more large chains and independents are expected to suffer. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say this is a crisis in casual dining,\u201d said Peter Martin at CGA. \u201cThis is a crisis happening for everyone.\u201d Restaurants are suffering because the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote has made ingredients more expensive while staff costs have risen, partly due to increases in the minimum wage. Economic uncertainty has stalled growth in the sector just as competition has increased after a surge in openings partly fuelled by private equity investment. Martin said: \u201cPeople are still going out to eat and drink but in the last four years we\u2019ve seen a net 4,000 new restaurants open. A lot of chains have gone into areas they shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d The readjustment follows a growth spurt by chains across the UK. In Leeds, Bradford and Manchester, there are more than a third more food-led licensed premises than there were five years ago. Liverpool\u2019s restaurant numbers are up by nearly a third. Martin said growth had peaked about three years ago and even pubs were experiencing a slowdown in food sales. Meanwhile, pressure on businesses has gradually been building since then as costs have risen. \u201cBrexit-driven costs have meant 11% food inflation at kitchen doors,\u201d Martin added. \u201cThe cost pressures are not going away. Prices have gone up and are staying up.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The performances of Harry Kane and his team-mates in the World Cup are helping the economy bounce back from its weather-beaten start to the year and supporting the need for an interest rate rise, the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist has said. Andy Haldane \u2013 who last week raised eyebrows by joining dissenters on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to vote for an increase from 0.5% to 0.75% \u2013 said England\u2019s recent football success had added to the \u201cfeelgood factor\u201d among consumers. In a speech in London, he said his decision to switch sides and cast his first dissenting vote since joining the MPC in 2014 was \u201chardly either surprising or radical\u201d, given that rates have now languished at emergency lows for 10 years. He added that consumer data had \u201cbounced back strongly\u201d in recent months. He said: \u201cThe underlying picture now appears to be one of gently rising household spending. This is being supported by highly accommodative credit conditions and now-positive growth in inflation-adjusted wages.\u201d Citing the World Cup as a factor, he added: \u201cAnd then, of course, there is the World Cup. Without wishing to tempt fate, England\u2019s recent sporting success on the football field (and cricket pitch) has probably added to that feelgood factor among England-supporting consumers.\u201d Haldane said an increase in the cost of borrowing to 0.75% would leave monetary conditions in the UK at an \u201cextraordinarily accommodative\u201d level. He said: \u201cAnd the aim in doing so is to lower the risk of needing to tighten policy less gradually in future and cause a sharper adjustment in the economy.\u201d The Bank held rates at 0.5% last week after a 6-3 vote because the majority of the MPC felt it better to wait until official data on the economy\u2019s performance in the second quarter. They are waiting for confirmation of a rebound after growth slowed sharply to 0.1% in the first three months amid the impact of the \u201cbeast from the east\u201d and a pullback in consumer spending. However, Mr Haldane said consumer data had \u201cbounced back strongly\u201d in recent months. He said: \u201cThe underlying picture now appears to be one of gently rising household spending. \u201cThis is being supported by highly accommodative credit conditions and now-positive growth in inflation-adjusted wages. \u201cAnd then, of course, there is the World Cup. Without wishing to tempt fate, England\u2019s recent sporting success on the football field (and cricket pitch) has probably added to that feelgood factor among England-supporting consumers.\u201d Haldane said he would have voted for a rise in May, had it not been for the poor economic data. He said it was better to take action now on rates than waiting. Haldane added: \u201cOf course, there are always some data \u2013 and, indeed, some football teams \u2013 which disappoint to the downside. That is what data does. But waiting for something to turn up is not a prudent strategy in life. And waiting for everything to turn up is certainly not a prudent strategy for monetary policy.\u201d He said he wanted to raise rates to help return inflation \u2013 currently at 2.4% \u2013 to the 2% target, \u201cgiven a tight labour market and gradually mounting pay pressures\u201d. This month\u2019s vote by the Bank of England marked the biggest split decision on the MPC since June 2017 and firmed economist expectations that the next rise could come in August, when the Bank\u2019s quarterly forecasts are also due to be published.",

      "bodyText": "Despite Wall Street making a partial recovery by the time European markets closed, this did little to help them. Trade war tensions continued to dominate sentiment, especially in Germany which is heavily dependent on exports. In the UK a weakening pound on doubts about interest rate rises helped the FTSE 100 outperform its peers, given the index is full of overseas earners which benefit from lower sterling. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished virtually unchanged, down just 6.06 points or 0.08% at 7615.63 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.39% to 12,177.23 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.97% lower at 5275.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.58% to 21,432.34 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.72% at 9589.0 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 11 points or 0.05%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Despite other distractions, the current trade tensions between the US and China - and elsewhere for that matter - continue to dominate market sentiment. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: Stocks have sold off as trade woes continue. Investors are cashing in on yesterday\u2019s gains, as trade tensions remain alive and well. Investors will want to see progress being made regarding trade negotiations before they hold on to stocks for several days at a time. As a result, markets are finding it difficult to hold on to a rally, which underlines the weak sentiment. Wall Street has regained much of its early losses but European markets continue to struggle. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: European markets have led the way lower, with the threat of a breakdown in trade disproportionately hurting stocks in countries which enjoy a sizeable trade surplus with the US. The continued deterioration in the Chinese yuan highlights the influence the Chinese government has upon their exchange rate, with the 5% rise in [dollar/yuan] over the past two months shifting the trade of terms before any tariffs even start to kick in. Brexit concerns continue to dominate local sentiment, with sliding consumer and business confidence dragging the pound to a seven-month low against the dollar. However, much of the story is related to the growing prominence of the US dollar, with the greenback likely to continue gaining ground as the trade war continues. With the likes of the EU and China holding huge surpluses in the trade of goods with the US, Trump knows they have more to gain than to lose. The sharp deterioration in German stocks this week is a clear nod to the reliance the country has upon physical exports. Today\u2019s downward revision for first quarter GDP out of the US provided a temporary dent in the dollar resurgence story. However, while GDP came in at 2%, rather than the 2.2% previously expected, the pathway in US PMI surveys points towards continued upside for US growth despite this short term blip. The continuing trade tensions between the US and China are on investors minds again, pushing US markets lower in early trading. News that Amazon is buying US online pharmacy group PillPack has hit shares in rival drugs companies, adding to the pressure on markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 85 points or 0.35% while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.03% and the Nasdaq Composite dipped by 0.09%. Haldane also appeared to take issue with the Labour party\u2019s proposal to give the Bank of England a mandate to boost productivity. In his speech Haldane said: It is ... well-known, including from historical experience, that productivity depends importantly on a number of structural features of the economy, including levels of education and skills in the workforce, the quality and quantity of infrastructure and innovation and the scale of financing to companies. Price and financial stability are necessary conditions for rising productivity. But they are far from being sufficient ones. When it comes to those structural features of the economy, central banks do not have the tools to affect lasting change. Central bank tools are cyclical, rather than structural, because their impact on the economy is temporary, not permanent. We do not build schools, colleges, houses, roads, railways or banks. Nor do we finance them. Those tools, rightly, are in the hands either of governments or private companies. So too is the financing of them. Here\u2019s the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics on Haldane\u2019s comments: Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane caught many observers off guard last week when he voted for an interest rate rise for the first time. But in a speech in London on the UK\u2019s productivity problem, he said the decision should not have been seen as \u201csurprising or radical.\u201d He said: Voting for a 25 basis point rate rise, a full decade after monetary policy was first placed on an emergency setting, is hardly either surprising or radical. A Bank Rate rise of 25 basis points would still leave monetary conditions in the UK extraordinarily accommodative by any historical metric. And the aim in doing so is to lower the risk of needing to tighten policy less gradually in future and cause a sharper adjustment in the economy. Truth be told, I would have voted to raise Bank Rate at the MPC\u2019s May meeting had data on the economy held firm. What we saw ahead of that meeting was a string of weak data suggesting consumer spending might be faltering. I believed there was option value in waiting to see if these data signalled the start of a lasting retrenchment by households, or were instead a temporary snow or statistical blip. With only a modest policy tightening needed over a number of years to return inflation to target, there was \u201cno rush\u201d. In the event, data on the consumer since the May MPC meeting has, virtually without exception, bounced back strongly. That includes measures of retail spending, consumer confidence and consumer credit. The underlying picture now appears to be one of gently rising household spending. This is being supported by highly accommodative credit conditions and now-positive growth in inflation-adjusted wages. And he added (saying he did not want to tempt fate even as he was doing so): And then, of course, there is the World Cup. Without wishing to tempt fate, England\u2019s recent sporting success on the football field (and cricket pitch) has probably added to that feel-good factor among England-supporting consumers. The \u201csmile count\u201d on my recent visits to Wales and Scotland was also as high as I can remember, although I suspect that may have been the weather rather than the football. More from Reuters: Haldane said there would always be some data that disappoints. \u201cBut waiting for something to turn up is not a prudent strategy in life. And waiting for everything to turn up is certainly not a prudent strategy for monetary policy,\u201d he said. Most of Haldane\u2019s speech focused on fixing Britain\u2019s abysmal record of productivity growth over the last 10 years. He said Britain\u2019s institutions should focus more on how to \u201ctrickle-down\u201d new technology to the swathes of the economy that have shown only weak growth in productivity. Stock markets continue to be volatile, with the worries about a potential trade war between the US and China continuing to dominate sentiment. The FTSE 100 is down 0.35%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.44% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 0.83%. The UK market is outperforming peers due to further weakness in the pound. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The FTSE avoided the losses seen over in the Eurozone, largely because of sterling\u2019s ongoing crisis. Concerns about a more pessimistic Brexit outlook from the country\u2019s businesses, a lack of faith in Theresa May heading into Thursday\u2019s EU summit, and disappointment at a dovish message from MPC member Jon Cunliffe left the pound in a sorry state. Against the dollar it was at a sub-$1.31, 7 month nadir after falling 0.3%, while against the euro it hit a 7 and a half week low of \u20ac1.1305 following a half a percent plunge. Meanwhile on Wall Street, the futures market is suggesting a fall of more than 100 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Back in the UK, and bad news for one DIY chain. Sarah Butler and Zoe Wood report: Homebase is cutting 300 jobs at its Milton Keynes head office amid speculation that up to 80 stores will close after its takeover by the restructuring specialist Hilco. The loss-making DIY chain was bought by the owner of HMV for \u00a31 in a deal agreed in May after its previous Australian owner, Wesfarmers, pulled the plug on a \u201cdisastrous\u201d venture into the UK. Wesfarmers, which bought the business for \u00a3340m two years ago, offloaded the entire 250-store Homebase chain, which has a workforce of just over 11,000 people, ditching a plan to convert them to its Bunnings brand. The full story is here: Newsflash: E-commerce giant Amazon has bought US online pharmacy chain PillPack, giving its rivals quite a headache: NEWSFLASH: America\u2019s economy suffered an even sharper slowdown than previously thought at the start of this year. New figures show that US GDP rose by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2018, or an \u2018annualised rate\u2019 of 2.0%. That\u2019s down from a previous estimate of 2.2%, and much slower than the 2.9% annualised rate recorded in October-December. It\u2019s still faster than Britain, where GDP only rose by 0.1% during the quarter (or 0.4% on an annualised basis). The slowdown won\u2019t worry US policymakers too much, though. Economists think US growth roared back in the current quarter, as Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts boosted demand. An annualised growth rate of 4.5% would pretty punchy -- although not unprecedented, as the president\u2019s son was reminded on Twitter last night.... In other news, oil giant BP has swooped on Britain\u2019s biggest network of electric car-charging points in a \u00a3130m deal. That\u2019s an intriguing move for BP, a company more known for extracting and refining crude than for renewable energy (despite trying to move \u2018beyond petroleum\u2019 at the start of the millennium). My colleague Adam Vaughan explains: The acquisition of Chargemaster, which has more than 6,500 charging points across the country, will begin to result in the deployment of fast chargers at BP\u2019s 1,200 forecourts over the next year. The deal is understood to be worth \u00a3130m and was lauded as a significant milestone towards cleaner motoring in the UK. There are more than 140,000 electric vehicles on the UK\u2019s roads, most of which are plug-in hybrid vehicles that can run for a short distance on battery power before switching to petrol or diesel. More here: Pub chain and brewer Greene King is already pinning its hopes on England enjoying a vintage World Cup. The Suffolk-based company says sales of beer and gin have both spiked during England\u2019s first two (triumphant) games, so is hoping for more success for the Three Lions*. CEO Rooney Anand says: \u201cLet\u2019s hope Harry Kane has got his shooting boots on tonight. His hat-trick on Sunday helped us sell nearly half a million [more] pints during the game. It remains true that when the sun shines or sport is on, people do want to go to the pub.\u201d * - unlike Ireland\u2019s Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, as EU leaders gather for today\u2019s summit in Brussels.... It\u2019s been a busy morning for the Bank of England. Deputy governor Sam Woods has written to the chief executives of Britain\u2019s banks and insurers, urging them to be cautious about getting involved with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Woods warned that digital currencies are new, volatile, and prone to use by organised criminals, saying: The range of products and market participants related to crypto-assets has grown quickly. In their short history, crypto-assets have exhibited high price volatility and relative illiquidity. Crypto-assets also raise concerns related to misconduct and market integrity \u2013 many appear vulnerable to fraud and manipulation, as well as money-laundering and terrorist financing risks. Entering into activity related to crypto-assets may give also rise to reputational risks. Woods wants banks to make a named, senior manager responsible for signing off any crypto-related ventures, and to avoid undue risk-taking. The letter is online here. Anyone who \u2018invested\u2019 in Bitcoin late last year won\u2019t need reminding that digital currencies are volatile. Bitcoin is trading at $6,100 this morning, down from around $20,000 in mid-December. At the risk of putting more pressure on Gareth Southgate, UK businesses are pinning their hopes on a World Cup sales boost. The Bank of England\u2019s regional agents report that sales of \u201celectronics and alcoholic drinks\u201d are expected to rise, as fans pile into the local pub or splash out on a new TV to admire Harry Kane\u2019s latest screamer. Brexit isn\u2019t bad news for all UK companies, of course. It\u2019s proving jolly lucrative for lawyers. The Bank of England explains: Business services turnover had been growing relatively solidly and more strongly than most other sectors. This was despite some hesitancy around client investment decisions that contacts reported had been driven by political uncertainty For professional services firms, Mergers and Acquisition (M&amp;A) activity from overseas buyers, Brexit preparations, and insolvency and restructuring activity had driven fee growth. The new GDPR rules on data have also bene a windfall for legal experts, the BoE adds, as companies have tried to understand how the regulations affect them. The growing pessimism about Brexit among British firms bolsters the case for a second referendum on EU membership, argues Labour MP Virendra Sharma. Sharma (a member of the Best for Britain campaign) points out that UK businesses are becoming more vocal about their concerns: \u201cThis report highlights the damage Brexit is doing to business. That means jobs are on the line. \u201cA number of big employers have come out against Brexit recently. From Airbus to BMW to Jaguar Land Rover, jobs are being cut and livelihoods put at stake - all because Theresa May is running scared of the ideological extremists in her party. \u201cBrexit means fewer jobs. The case for a people\u2019s vote with the option to stay in the EU becomes clearer by the day.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s threats against America\u2019s trading partners is also causing jitters in the UK, the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents report: Brexit was causing exporters and clients to examine their supply chains due to potential tariff and non-tariff barriers, and there were growing concerns about global trade protectionism. Here\u2019s an example of why UK firms are worried about Brexit: Today\u2019s Regional Agents report also shows that Britain\u2019s consumers are cutting back, particularly when it comes to big-ticket items. Growth in demand for consumer goods had not recovered sufficiently to make up for sales lost due to the adverse weather in Q1, however, and there was ongoing weak demand for new cars, white goods and homewares. Contacts attributed more cautious consumer sentiment to squeezed real incomes, higher pensions auto\u2011enrolment contributions and political uncertainty. Third-sector contacts suggested that delays in benefit payments and benefits sanctions were increasing the pressure on low-income households. Worryingly, this means some consumer-focused firms are now planning to axe jobs: Brexit is also making it harder for UK firms to find workers. The Bank of England\u2019s regional agents say that a drop in EU migration into the UK is hurting farms, restaurants and distributions firms: Recruitment difficulties remained elevated and were widespread across sectors and job roles. There were a growing number of reports of vacancies taking longer to fill and, in a small number of cases, labour shortages were constraining headcount growth. This was particularly the case where skill shortages were most acute, eg construction trades, drivers, specialist engineering and IT. A continued slowing in the inward flow of EU migrants for lower skilled and/or seasonal work was reported to be acting as a constraint in sectors such agriculture and food, hospitality and warehousing. Big UK firms, and those with an overseas focus, are particularly anxious about Brexit. The Bank of England\u2019s regional agents say the uncertainty is forcing them to cut back on investment: Brexit uncertainty was weighing down discretionary or expansionary investment for some medium to larger-sized businesses, or those with a greater international focus. SMEs and domestic-facing businesses were more likely to maintain a business as usual approach to investment as potential Brexit effects remained unclear. Newsflash: UK firms have become gloomier about the impact of Brexit on their sales in recent months. The latest report from the Bank of England\u2019s regional agents, just released, shows an increase in the number of companies expecting a negative impact from Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. The number of companies expecting a Brexit boost has also dropped a little, compared to three months ago. As you can see, rather more companies expect Brexit to be a negative experience. Overall, UK businesses expect around 3% to be wiped off their sales, the Bank says: The average eventual change in sales was negative and stood at around -3%. Using the same methodology would suggest that the most pessimistic 10% of businesses expected a reduction in sales of more than 10% due to Brexit, while the most optimistic 10% of respondents expected a boost of 1% or more. The Regional Agents also flag up a rise in debt defaults, as struggling UK companies fall into administration: Suppliers to consumer-facing businesses had reported an increased incidence of bad debts, and contacts expected continued retail and restaurant company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and administrations as rising costs and over\u2011supply put pressure on balance sheets. Sterling has hit a new seven-month low this morning, as traders digest Jon Cunliffe\u2019s warning about household debt levels. The pound extended its recent slide and hit $1.3076, down almost half a cent, its lowest point since November 2017. City traders are also concerned about the state of play with Brexit; overnight, Irish PM Irish leader Leo Varadkar said the lack of progress was \u201cdisappointing\u201d. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says the pound\u2019s \u201cmisery\u201d seems to know no end. With the Bank of England concerned about household debt, and investors doubtful about the smooth progress of Brexit despite Theresa May\u2019s attempts at reassurance ahead of the day\u2019s key EU summit, sterling fell 0.4% against the dollar, taking cable under $1.31 for the first time since early November last year. Against the euro, meanwhile, it dipped 0.3%, teasing a fresh month and a half low. Some lenders are already more reluctant to lend to consumers - perhaps anticipating the sort of financial downturn that is worrying the Bank of England. The Bank\u2019s latest survey shows a very sharp decline in the availability of consumer credit - even bigger than during the last financial crisis. The BoE explained yesterday that the boom in buying cars on credit deals seems to have faded: The slowdown in consumer credit growth is consistent with a reduction in demand as well as some tightening in supply. Slower car finance growth may be driven by the wider weakness in the car market, reflected in falls in new car registrations since end-2016. In addition, the structural shift increasing the share of cars purchased with some form of car finance may also have come to an end. More generally, the reduction in credit demand may be linked to slightly lower consumer confidence Jon Cunliffe also rejected the chance to throw his hat into the ring to replace his boss, Mark Carney. Asked if he\u2019ll be in the running to become governor when Carney leaves next summer, Cunliffe replied: \u201cI\u2019ve got a really challenging and difficult job and I\u2019m just focusing on doing it the best I can. When he\u2019s not being distracted by the World Cup, anyway..... Jon Cunliffe also played down the prospect of interest rates rising sharply soon. Cunliffe is one of the more dovish members of the Monetary Policy Committee - one of the six who voted to leave rates unchanged at just 0.5% last week. Asked whether borrowing costs could hit 2.5% in a few years, Cunliffe pointed out that the City only expects them to rise modestly: \u201cFinancial markets are assuming that interest rates go up by another three-quarters of a percentage point over the next couple of years.\u201d \u201cWe do our forecasting on the basis of where the financial markets have those interest rates and we think we have inflation at target at those sorts of levels. This chart (from yesterday\u2019s Financial Stability Report) shows why the Bank is fretting about household debt levels: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. One of the Bank of England\u2019s top policymakers has warned that indebted households could be in peril if Britain falls into recession. Deputy governor Jon Cunliffe told BBC radio this morning that he\u2019s concerned about families with high debt levels. Cunliffe warned that some households have run up worrying levels of debts, which could drag them into a crisis if the economy sours, saying: \u201c(Household debt is) quite high by historical standards but (households have) worked hard to put those debt levels down. But within that there are areas that you do worry about. \u201cYou worry about households that have high debt (and) could be badly affected in a recession.\u201d UK household debt now totals \u00a31.8 trillion. Around 75% of that is mortgage debt, which will become more expensive to repay if interest rates go up. The rest is mostly in consumer credit. Yesterday, the Bank\u2019s latest financial stability report shows how household debt is creeping up again, when compared to the nation\u2019s income. We\u2019re not at 2008 levels yet, but policymakers seem concerned about the direction of travel. Cunliffe\u2019s comments come a day after high street bellwether John Lewis revealed its profits had collapsed to almost nothing so far this year. Also coming up today One of Cunliffe\u2019s colleagues, chief economist Andy Haldane, gives a speech this afternoon. He may elaborate on why he voted to raise interest rates last week. European stock markets rallied yesterday after America backed away from imposing new curbs on Chinese investment in the UK. But they may fall back today, after a late wobble on Wall Street yesterday. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says: Despite an early burst higher for the Dow following Trump\u2019s turnaround on Chinese restrictions, the index surrendered its biggest daily gain in 4 months to close 165 points in the red. A selloff in tech stocks &amp; financials overshadowing a rally in the energy sector. Asian markets took their cues from the US, heading southwards overnight. China, which technically entered bear market territory in the previous session after dropping 20% from its January peak, continued to grind lower, as trade war concerns and a slowing of momentum in the economy have sent investors running. It\u2019s a relatively busy day on the economic front, with eurozone confidence figures, German inflation data, and an updated estimate of US growth in the last quarter. Traders will also be watching events in Brussels tonight, where EU leaders gather for a summit dominated by migration and Brexit.

The continued deterioration in the Chinese yuan highlights the influence the Chinese government has upon their exchange rate, with the 5% rise in [dollar/yuan] over the past two months shifting the trade of terms before any tariffs even start to kick in. </p> <p>Brexit concerns continue to dominate local sentiment, with sliding consumer and business confidence dragging the pound to a seven-month low against the dollar. However, much of the story is related to the growing prominence of the US dollar, with the greenback likely to continue gaining ground as the trade war continues. With the likes of the EU and China holding huge surpluses in the trade of goods with the US, Trump knows they have more to gain than to lose. The sharp deterioration in German stocks this week is a clear nod to the reliance the country has upon physical exports. Today\u2019s downward revision for first quarter GDP out of the US provided a temporary dent in the dollar resurgence story.</p> <p> However, while GDP came in at 2%, rather than the 2.2% previously expected, the pathway in US PMI surveys points towards continued upside for US growth despite this short term blip.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b34ed90e4b08b4490eac47a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-28T14:19:18.409Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street falls back</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The continuing trade tensions between the US and China are on investors minds again, pushing US markets lower in early trading.

But they are far from being sufficient ones.</p> <p>When it comes to those structural features of the economy, central banks do not have the tools to affect lasting change. Central bank tools are cyclical, rather than structural, because their impact on the economy is temporary, not permanent. We do not build schools, colleges, houses, roads, railways or banks.

A Bank Rate rise of 25 basis points would still leave monetary conditions in the UK extraordinarily accommodative by any historical metric. And the aim in doing so is to lower the risk of needing to tighten policy less gradually in future and cause a sharper adjustment in the economy.</p> <p>Truth be told, I would have voted to raise Bank Rate at the MPC\u2019s May meeting had data on the economy held firm. What we saw ahead of that meeting was a string of weak data suggesting consumer spending might be faltering. I believed there was option value in waiting to see if these data signalled the start of a lasting retrenchment by households, or were instead a temporary snow or statistical blip. With only a modest policy tightening needed over a number of years to return inflation to target, there was \u201cno rush\u201d. </p> <p>In the event, data on the consumer since the May MPC meeting has, virtually without exception, bounced back strongly. That includes measures of retail spending, consumer confidence and consumer credit. The underlying picture now appears to be one of gently rising household spending. This is being supported by highly accommodative credit conditions and now-positive growth in inflation-adjusted wages. </p> </blockquote> <p>And he added (saying he did not want to tempt fate even as he was doing so):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And then, of course, there is the World Cup. Without wishing to tempt fate, England\u2019s recent sporting success on the football field (and cricket pitch) has probably added to that feel-good factor among England-supporting consumers. The \u201csmile count\u201d on my recent visits to Wales and Scotland was also as high as I can remember, although I suspect that may have been the weather rather than the football. </p> </blockquote> <p>More from Reuters:</p> <blockquote> <p>Haldane said there would always be some data that disappoints.</p> <p>\u201cBut waiting for something to turn up is not a prudent strategy in life. And waiting for everything to turn up is certainly not a prudent strategy for monetary policy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Most of Haldane\u2019s speech focused on fixing Britain\u2019s abysmal record of productivity growth over the last 10 years.</p> <p>He said Britain\u2019s institutions should focus more on how to \u201ctrickle-down\u201d new technology to the swathes of the economy that have shown only weak growth in productivity.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b34ddf7e4b02f6ecf5e9819\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-28T13:13:36.472Z\">2.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Stock markets continue to be volatile, with the worries about a potential trade war between the US and China continuing to dominate sentiment.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 is down 0.35%, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 1.44% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 0.83%.

      "bodyText": "Homebase is cutting 300 jobs at its Milton Keynes head office amid speculation that up to 80 stores will close after its takeover by the restructuring specialist Hilco. The loss-making DIY chain was bought by the owner of HMV for \u00a31 in a deal agreed in May after its previous Australian owner, Wesfarmers, pulled the plug on a \u201cdisastrous\u201d venture into the UK. Wesfarmers, which bought the business for \u00a3340m two years ago, offloaded the entire 250-store Homebase chain, which has a workforce of just over 11,000 people, ditching a plan to convert them to its Bunnings brand. Homebase said a third of its head office staff would leave by November as it focused on its DIY brand. All 24 of the stores rebranded to Bunnings will become Homebase outlets again. Damian McGloughlin, the chief executive of Homebase, said: \u201cWe have not taken this decision lightly but decisive action is required to start rebuilding Homebase\u2019s position in the UK market. We will be providing as much support as we can to help those affected through this difficult time.\u201d The job cuts come amid speculation that Homebase is considering a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency, which would enable it to close up to 80 stores and renegotiate leases with landlords. The company has already shut 17 unprofitable stores and confirmed plans to close at least 23 more. Industry insiders said a CVA involving between 60 and 80 stores was one of a number of options being considered by Homebase\u2019s new owner. The botched Australian acquisition of Homebase is seen as one of the most disastrous retail takeovers, alongside Tesco\u2019s doomed expansion into the US market with the Fresh &amp; Easy grocery chain. Wesfarmers had intended to spend \u00a3500m giving the Homebase chain a facelift, turning it into a British version of its successful Australian DIY chain, which is famous for low prices and sausage sizzles. However, in a tough UK market hit by a slowdown in house buying, Bunnings struggled to find a foothold amid stiff competition from rivals such as B&amp;Q, Argos and Wickes. The company was expected to make a loss of nearly \u00a3100m in the first half of this year alone. The difficulties at Homebase are partly self-inflicted by a decision to stop selling home furnishings and remove popular concessions such as Habitat and Argos. But they also reflect wider problems in the UK retail sector that have led to mass closures by chains including New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare. In March, DIY rival B&amp;Q, which is owned by Kingfisher, said sales dropped by 5.1% and profits for the year to the end of January were down by 10% to \u00a3682m. Retailers across the board are struggling as the fall in the value of the pound pushes up the cost of buying goods overseas alongside a rise in the legal minimum wage and business rates changes. The rise of online shopping has also hit profits at traditional retailers, which are having to invest in home delivery infrastructure and IT while facing new competition from internet specialists. These structural changes come as shoppers rein in spending because of uncertainty caused by Brexit and a shift towards renting, rather than owning, homes. If Homebase does attempt a CVA it may face a backlash from landlords who have already expressed discontent at the department store House of Fraser over its planned closure of more than half of its 59 stores. The CVA won approval last week but some leaseholders are considering challenging the vote, a move possible within 28 days of it passing.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP has bought the UK\u2019s biggest electric car charging network, in the latest sign of major oil producers addressing the threat that low-carbon vehicles pose to their core business. The acquisition of Chargemaster, which has more than 6,500 charging points across the country, will begin to result in the deployment of fast chargers at BP\u2019s 1,200 forecourts over the next year. The deal is understood to be worth \u00a3130m and was lauded as a significant milestone towards cleaner motoring in the UK. There are more than 140,000 electric vehicles on the UK\u2019s roads, most of which are plug-in hybrid vehicles that can run for a short distance on battery power before switching to petrol or diesel. BP estimates the number of electric vehicles will hit 12m by 2040, although some analysts put the figure much higher. Tufan Erginbilgic, the chief executive of BP\u2019s downstream division, which includes refineries and petrol stations, said: \u201cEffectively, BP becomes a leading provider of energy to low-carbon vehicles in the UK. I would like to emphasise the world and the UK needs ultra-fast charging for electric vehicles to scale up.\u201d He denied the transaction was a defensive move, saying the company had good returns in powering electric cars, comparable to other parts of its business. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is defensive at all,\u201d he said. Erginbilgic said BP was doing more on electric car infrastructure in the UK than any other market, although the firm is also piloting chargers in Germany later this year. The company said the rebadged BP Chargemaster would prioritise ultra-fast 150KW charging, which can add around 450-600 miles of range per hour of charging. That would mean a car such as Jaguar\u2019s new I-Pace could add about 100 miles in 10 minutes. Charging a car at home usually takes around six to 12 hours, unless the household has an upgraded charging point. Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive, has said the company is finally strong enough financially, after the Deepwater Horizon disaster and oil price slump, to start moving deeper into greener energy. The \u00a3130m paid for Chargemaster is part of the $500m (\u00a3382m) the UK-based oil firm has pledged to spend on low-carbon activities and follows a recent return to solar power. However, it is still a small slice of the total $15-16bn that the company will spend this year. The foray into electric car infrastructure is much bigger than the one BP made in January, when it invested $5m in the US firm Freewire Technologies. BP\u2019s Anglo-Dutch rival Shell took its first steps into the market last year, installing chargers on its forecourts and buying the Dutch firm New Motion, which has 30,000 charging points in Europe. Asked if the company could be expected to make further steps into the electric car market, Erginbilgic said: \u201cYes, but not for the sake of investment; they must be in line with our strategy. I don\u2019t believe the fastest person in this space will succeed.\u201d Albert Cheung, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said: \u201cOil majors like BP face a double threat from electric vehicles. They\u2019ll take a hit on oil demand but they\u2019ll also face declining customer traffic at their petrol stations. BP understand the threats and see the opportunity to be part of the EV industry.\u201d BNEF expects more than half of UK cars to be electric by 2040.",

The Competition and Markets Authority has been investigating whether sites are misleading consumers since October and identified a number of areas of concern. The CMA did not name the companies it was investigating, but leading sites include Expedia and Booking.com. The regulator is examining the extent to which a hotel\u2019s ranking on a website may be influenced by the size of its commission. The CMA said details on the sites about how many people are looking at a room, how many are left and how long a price is available can create a false impression of availability or rush customers into making a booking decision. About 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites, according to the regulator, but many have found the final price paid was inflated by unexpected extra charges such as taxes and booking fees added later. \u201cBooking sites can make it so much easier to choose your holiday, but only if people are able to trust them,\u201d said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA. \u201cWe are demanding that sites think again about how they are presenting information to their customers to make sure they are complying with the law. Our next step is to take any necessary action \u2013 including through the courts if needed \u2013 to ensure people get a fair deal.\u201d Guy Anker, the deputy editor of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: \u201cHotel prices on booking and comparison sites can often be misleading. \u201cWhile the full extent of the CMA\u2019s action is unclear, we hope it will clamp down hard on sites that outrageously fail to show the true cost upfront, and that claim false discounts or pressure-sell by wrongly suggesting the hotel is almost sold out.\u201d The regulator has ordered the sites to review their practices and respond within the next few months.",

Rooney Anand, the chief executive of the Suffolk-based business, said warm weather and the World Cup had brought more people to its pubs. \u201cLet\u2019s hope Harry Kane has got his shooting boots on tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cHis hat-trick on Sunday helped us sell nearly half a million [more] pints during the game. It remains true that when the sun shines or sport is on, people do want to go to the pub.\u201d He said the company had budgeted for only three England matches, so the team\u2019s presence in the last 16 would be a bonus. \u201cA lot of beer is being drunk, a lot of cider and gin. Gin sales are up 50% year on year,\u201d Anand said. In the past, World Cups mainly increased lager consumption. But Anand said fans are now drinking craft beer, gin and wine. In many of Greene King\u2019s pubs, this is raising sales by 50%-100% on England match days. The company has invested in better TV screens and rolled out its season ticket app in 750 pubs. In the run-up to the World Cup, about 100,000 customers signed up to the app, which allows them to find forthcoming sports fixtures and features personalised offers and loyalty points at participating pubs. Anand dismissed suggestions that pubs could run out of beer due to a Europe-wide shortage of food-grade carbon dioxide, despite supplies running low of John Smith\u2019s and Strongbow at some JD Wetherspoon pubs and elsewhere. Booker, the UK\u2019s biggest wholesaler, which supplies convenience stores and restaurant chains, has begun rationing beer, cider and soft drinks. Anand said Greene King had experienced \u201ca little bit of disruption\u201d to supplies. Greene King, which runs more than 3,000 pubs, restaurants and hotels, and owns Hungry Horse, Chef &amp; Brewer and Farmhouse Inns, posted an 11% fall in annual profit to \u00a3243m, but said trading had improved in recent weeks. Like-for-like sales are up 2.2% in the past two months. The company was negatively affected by heavy snow in February and March, and faces higher costs related to increases in the national minimum wage and business rates, and the weaker pound. It said cost increases had not been passed on to customers. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said rivals had performed far better. \u201cGreene King can\u2019t rely on a few good weeks to revive earnings growth. They need to think longer term and focus on core strengths,\u201d he said.",

Australia\u2019s second biggest telco came under fire for its coverage of the World Cup, which has been marred by technical problems to its streaming service and left fans angry. SBS came to the rescue, agreeing to show all the matches until the end of the group stage on Thursday evening, but now the deal has been extended. SBS will simulcast with Optus until the end of the tournament on Monday 16 July, giving fans the chance to see the games on TV, SBS On Demand, the Fifa World Cup app and on The World Game website. It\u2019s understood Optus sub-licenced the rights to the World Cup from SBS for around $8m but the telco\u2019s plans to stream all 64 matches in Russia were derailed by buffering issues. SBS managing director Michael Ebeid said on Thursday SBS was pleased to be able to simulcast the world\u2019s biggest sporting event with Optus. \u201cWith 8 million Australians tuning into SBS\u2019s coverage to date, we know how passionate the country is about the world game and are confident fans will continue to engage with the matches as we head towards the end of the competition in Russia,\u201d Ebeid said. The popular daily show with Craig Foster and Lucy Zeli\u0107 will continue at 5.30pm each day, as well as replays of the SBS Match of the Day each morning at 6.30am. Football fans will also be able to sign up to Optus Sport for free until 31 August. Anyone who has already paid will have the $15 subscription fee refunded. Optus CEO Allen Lew admitted in its press release to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d but said they would persist with \u201cinnovation\u201d. \u201cWe had technical issues with the Optus Sport service over the first weekend of the tournament but we are confident that these issues have now been addressed. All of us at Optus will use what we have learned from this experience to place ourselves ahead in the delivery of content to customers via streaming to their mobile device. \u201cOur customers and viewers have been the priority in our decision making and that\u2019s why we have provided several ways to watch the matches, offered refunds and introduced a range of measures to address the technical issues experienced by some Optus Sport viewers.\u201d",
