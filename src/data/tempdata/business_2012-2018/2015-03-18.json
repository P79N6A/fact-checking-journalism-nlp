      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve called time on an era of historically low interest rates on Wednesday. In its latest statement on the health of the US economy the central bank moved away from a pledge to be \u201cpatient\u201d before deciding to raise interest rates. Economists expect that interest rates could now rise by the end of the summer, the first rise in more than six years. The news marks the beginning of the end of the last central element of an economic policy born in the darkest hours of the Great Recession. The Fed has already ended a massive bond-buying programme, known as quantitative easing. But the central bank signalled that it still has concerns about the economy and would not rush to raise rates. Stock markets, which had fallen ahead of the release, rose on the news as the Fed chair Janet Yellen cooled expectations of an immediate hike. \u201cJust because we have removed the word patient from the statement does not mean we are going to be impatient,\u201d Yellen said at a press conference. All US markets rose. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day up 227 points, having lost 130 points ahead of the Fed\u2019s statement. The Fed said rates would not rise before \u201cfurther improvement in the labor market\u201d and only when it was confident inflation was moving back to its 2% objective over the medium term. \u201cThe committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the committee views as normal in the longer run,\u201d the Fed said in its statement. Randy Kroszner, Norman R. Bobins professor of economics at the university of Chicago Booth school of business and former governor of the Fed, said Yellen had been \u201cvery skillful\u201d in the language used to signal the end of the low rate period. Before the Fed was \u201cpatient\u201d it had said rates would be low for a \u201cconsiderable period\u201d but that phrase was phased out. Now patient too has been dropped and so far there have been few major ructions. \u201cThe latest statement gives the Fed a greater deal of flexibility to move when it needs to,\u201d said Kroszner. \u201cWe are moving away from a focus on dates to data.\u201d The Fed cut its benchmark short-term interest rate to zero on 16 December 2008 and it has remained close to zero ever since. The rock bottom rate policy was part of a massive stimulus programme aimed at revitalising the economy in the wake of the worst recession since the Great Depression. The Fed\u2019s decision comes after months of impressive growth in the jobs market. Last month US unemployment rate fell to 5.5%, down from a peak of 10% in October 2009. Last year was the best year for job growth since the late 1990s. Before the decision, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that markets could suffer a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d after the decision, as they did when the Fed announced it would ease off its massive bond buying programme, known as quantitative easing, in 2013. But the Fed\u2019s still cautious approach appeared to have paid off. \u201cWhat\u2019s important about this part of the statement is that it clearly says the FOMC is looking for \u2018further\u2019 improvement, meaning the economy and labour market has not yet met whatever criteria necessary to warrant a rate hike. We remain of the belief the Fed will first raise rates in September and view this statement, and the projection changes, and reducing the odds of a June hike,\u201d Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at broker BTIG, wrote in a note to investors.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares received a budget boost, heading back towards all time highs despite concerns that the US Federal Reserve could signal an interest rate rise later on Wednesday following its latest meeting. The FTSE 100 finished 107.59 points or 1.57% higher at 6945.20, within 16 points of its record close earlier this month. There was no support from US markets, which faltered ahead of the Fed news, or European shares, which were weaker on continuing worries about Greece and its continuing disputes with the EU over its precarious financial position. But chancellor George Osborne\u2019s proposals to boost saving lifted investment group Hargreaves Lansdown 32p to \u00a312.06 and St James\u2019s Place 48p to 978p. Bernstein analysts said: This year\u2019s budget further incentivises long-term retail saving and is therefore broadly positive for investment providers, particularly those focused on the mass retail market (as opposed to those focused on more affluent savers). We consider the main beneficiary in our coverage to be Hargreaves Lansdown, albeit the latter\u2019s current gain [of 5%] seems to us overdone. Housebuilders were lifted by the new Help to Buy ISA scheme to assist first time buyers, with Taylor Wimpey up 3.9p at 153.2p and Persimmon 16p higher at \u00a317.60. Tax changes to support North Sea oil producers, hit by rising costs and falling crude prices, helped Tullow Oil climb 4.4p to 302.8p while Parkmead put on 4.25p to 117.25p. Royal Dutch Shell A shares were also higher, up 47.5p at 2022.5p. Drinks companies were toasting Osborne\u2019s duty cuts, with Diageo 44p higher at \u00a319.54 and pubs group JD Wetherspoon up 8.5p at 783.5p, while other consumer stocks benefited from rises in the personal tax thresholds, with Marks &amp; Spencer adding 10.5p to 515.5p and Next up 105p at \u00a376.20 ahead of its figures on Thursday. Banks shook off early weakness after the Chancellor raised the cost of the levy and acted to stop them from deducting PPI compensation payments from corporation tax liabilities. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 1p to 351.7p while Lloyds Banking Group edged up 0.04p to 79.50p, despite news of another \u00a39bn sale of government-owned shares. Standard Chartered surged 78p or 8% to \u00a310.43 after positive notes from both Barclays and Bernstein. Elsewhere, building materials group CRH has been weak in recent days after problems with the proposed merger between Lafarge and Holcim seemed to jeopardise its plans to buy unwanted assets from the combined group. But hopes the merger was back on track lifted CRH 84p to \u00a317.71. AstraZeneca added 110p to \u00a347.50 after positive results from Phase 3 trials of its experimental drug PT003 to treat chronic lung disease. Shore Capital analyst Brian White said: AstraZeneca management has identified its respiratory franchise as one of five growth drivers for the business alongside Brilinta, Diabetes, emerging markets and Japan (oncology is also certainly emerging as a sixth growth platform) and fleshing out of the product offering in order to complete in this market is essential in our view. Other assets in Astra\u2019s respiratory pipeline include the twice daily triple therapy (PT010) which is scheduled to enter Phase 3 evaluation...during 2015. Smiths Group ended 22p higher at \u00a312 despite a 5% fall in first half profits and a warning its John Crane subsidiary could be hit in the second half by oil and gas producers cutting investment. The news was slightly mitigated by the budget proposals to help North Sea production. RSA Insurance rose 6.4p to 429.4p on hopes for a boost from the rumoured sale of its Latin American operations. Berenberg said a sale could be \u201ca game changer\u201d for the insurer: The funds raised should take RSA\u2019s capital metrics beyond regulatory uncertainty, allowing the group to reach a competitive dividend payout ratio sooner than we anticipated. Under this scenario, we estimate the shares could be worth 504p based on a dividend discount model, representing 20% and 12% upside to the current share price and our sustainable return on equity-based valuation, respectively. We retain our hold rating to reflect that RSA\u2019s management has not confirmed it is considering the disposal. From a strategic perspective, the Latin America disposal would make sense, in our view. The further narrowing of the group\u2019s focus would allow management to dedicate more attention and funds to improving its other core markets (UK, Canada, Scandinavia and Ireland), giving it a fighting chance of closing the gap to best-in-class peers. We would expect this to eventually offset the earnings dilution caused by the sale. We expect there to be considerable demand...from the likes of Allianz, Zurich, Axa, ACE, Mapfre, Travelers, Talanx and many others. Hence, the asset should fetch a higher price than the rumoured \u00a3500m, in our view. Nevertheless, we have assumed a \u00a3500m sales price in our pro-forma estimates to ensure that these are not reliant on RSA outperforming on the disposal. The mining sector was weaker on worries about the outlook for the Chinese economy, with Rio Tinto down 43p at 2830.5p and BHP Billiton 5p lower at \u00a314.58. Vedanta Resources dipped 2.7p to 439.9p on continuing concerns about India\u2019s demand that its Cairn India subsidiary pay a $3.2bn tax liability. Weir slipped 17p to \u00a317.63 after Morgan Stanley reduced its rating on the pumping equipment specialist from equalweight to underweight. Finally, chip designer Imagination Technologies lost 28p to 230.25p after a disappointing update, with lower than expected licensing revenues.",

    "webTitle": "Federal Reserve expected to signal the end of zero interest rates", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Federal Reserve officials have begun a two-day meeting, which is expected to pave the way for the first rise in interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis. US policymakers meeting in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to remove the word \u201cpatient\u201d when they put out a statement about when to raise interest rates from their current record low. If they drop the \u201cpatient\u201d policy, which Wall Street widely expects, it will put the world on notice that the era of zero interest rates is nearly over. It would mean that from June officials would be making rate decisions meeting-by-meeting, based on economic data and not committing themselves to keeping borrowing rates artificially low. Dealers have already pencilled in 17 June as the date when rates may rise. Almost 90% of economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the Fed officials will drop the \u201cpatient\u201d pledge from their statement released after the two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting ends on Wednesday. Some 45% of the 49 economists polled predicted rates would rise in June, 37% said they expected a September rate hike. The FOMC has already scaled back on its near-zero interest rate pledge. In December, it dropped a commitment to keep rates super low for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d, instead saying central bankers \u201ccould be patient\u201d and wait for further signs that the US economy is firmly on track before raising rates. In December, the Fed chair, Janet Yellen, said the phrase meant the committee was unlikely to move rates in its next two sessions. The FOMC repeated the language in January, effectively ruling out an increase in March and April. Franck Dixmier, chief investment officer of European fixed income at Allianz Global Investors, said: \u201cWe expect that the Federal Reserve is going to \u2018lose patience\u2019 on Wednesday and, in our opinion, there is no justification for anything else. \u201cInvestors need not worry, however, because we are talking about the semantics of monetary policy guidance, not the concrete actions that will drive liftoff of US interest rates later this year. \u201cWith unemployment running at 5.5%, the US labor market booming and an economy that is growing at around 3%, the Federal Reserve has no real reason to maintain zero interest rates any longer. Hence, Yellen will almost certainly drop reference to remaining patient about raising key rates on Wednesday and, in our opinion, an initial hike is set to follow in June.\u201d Economists at Capital Economics said the dropping of the word \u201cpatient\u201d would be the beginning of a return to \u201cnormalise monetary policy\u201d. \u201cEven with headline inflation below zero, we then anticipate a first hike in June, with the FOMC pushing the target range for the fed funds rate to 1.00-1.25% by the end of this year and 2.75-3.00% by end-2016,\u201d they said. Ray Dalio, one of the world\u2019s most powerful hedge fund managers, warned that raising rates might cause an economic crisis similar to that experienced in 1937. Dalio, founder of the $165bn Bridgewater Associates hedge fund, told investors in a note, published by ValueWalk on Tuesday. US stock market\u2019s were slightly down on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday\u2019s statement. The Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 was down 0.36% to 2,073.68 at 3pm. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.76% to 17,841.",

      "body": "<p>Federal Reserve officials have begun a two-day meeting, which is expected to pave the way for the first rise in interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis.<br></p> <p>US policymakers meeting in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday are expected to remove the word \u201cpatient\u201d when they put out a statement about when to raise interest rates from their current record low. </p> <p>If they drop the \u201cpatient\u201d policy, which Wall Street widely expects, it will put the world on notice that the era of zero interest rates is nearly over.</p> <p>It would mean that from June officials would be making rate decisions meeting-by-meeting, based on economic data and not committing themselves to keeping borrowing rates artificially low. Dealers have already pencilled in 17 June as the date when rates may rise.</p> <p>Almost 90% of economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the Fed officials will drop the \u201cpatient\u201d pledge from their statement released after the two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting ends on Wednesday. Some 45% of the 49 economists polled predicted rates would rise in June, 37% said they expected a September rate hike.</p> <p>The FOMC has already scaled back on its near-zero interest rate pledge. In December, it dropped a commitment to keep rates super low for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d, instead saying central bankers \u201ccould be patient\u201d and wait for further signs that the US economy is firmly on track before raising rates.</p> <p>In December, the Fed chair, Janet Yellen, said the phrase meant the committee was unlikely to move rates in its next two sessions. The FOMC repeated the language in January, effectively ruling out an increase in March and April.</p> <p>Franck Dixmier, chief investment officer of European fixed income at Allianz Global Investors, said: \u201cWe expect that the Federal Reserve is going to \u2018lose patience\u2019 on Wednesday and, in our opinion, there is no justification for anything else.</p> <p>\u201cInvestors need not worry, however, because we are talking about the semantics of monetary policy guidance, not the concrete actions that will drive liftoff of US interest rates later this year.</p> <p>\u201cWith unemployment running at 5.5%, the US labor market booming and an economy that is growing at around 3%, the Federal Reserve has no real reason to maintain zero interest rates any longer. Hence, Yellen will almost certainly drop reference to remaining patient about raising key rates on Wednesday and, in our opinion, an initial hike is set to follow in June.\u201d</p> <p>Economists at Capital Economics said the dropping of the word \u201cpatient\u201d would be the beginning of a return to \u201cnormalise monetary policy\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven with headline inflation below zero, we then anticipate a first hike in June, with the FOMC pushing the target range for the fed funds rate to 1.00-1.25% by the end of this year and 2.75-3.00% by end-2016,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Ray Dalio, one of the world\u2019s most powerful hedge fund managers, warned that raising rates might cause an economic crisis similar to that experienced in 1937. Dalio, founder of the $165bn Bridgewater Associates hedge fund, told investors in a note, <a href=\"http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/03/ray-dalio-warning/\">published by ValueWalk on Tuesday</a>.</p> <p>US stock market\u2019s were slightly down on Tuesday ahead of Wednesday\u2019s statement. The Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500 was down 0.36% to 2,073.68 at 3pm. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.76% to 17,841.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Russian oligarchs in dispute with the British government over their move to buy a series of North Sea oil and gas fields are now considering whether to back down and sell the assets. The LetterOne Group, led by Mikhail Fridman, is hiring financial advisers to help look at a variety of options for the fields, which were acquired when the company bought the Dea oil and gas firm from Germany\u2019s RWE utility. The Russians, who have brought in former BP boss John Browne to head up their new subsidiary, L1 Energy, which will oversee Dea, had previously warned they may sue the Department of Energy and Climate Change. But sources confirmed that Fridman and his colleagues, including the former TNK-BP director German Khan, are now looking at an outright sale or asset swap in what would be a victory for Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary. They are said to be keen to avoid a confrontation, which could prove costly and time consuming, at a time when they are keen to build a substantial new oil business run by Lord Browne. No formal decision has yet been made on a sale, the sources insisted, but LetterOne want an investment bank or other financial adviser to properly assess a range of options, including offloading the 12 North Sea fields. The row had blown up due to deteriorating relations between the Russian state and the west over Crimea and Ukraine. The British government is concerned that if tougher sanctions were imposed against the Kremlin in future the UK\u2019s own oil and gas supplies could be endangered if they were controlled by a Russian-led company. The DECC is worried about what happened when sanctions were imposed on Iran, which led in 2010 to the temporary shutdown of the North Sea Rhum field co-owned by BP and the state-owned National Iranian Oil Company. Davey said last month he was \u201cminded\u201d to require that the Dea offshore fields, which provide as much as 5% of the UK\u2019s gas output, be passed on to a suitable third party. The oligarchs originally reacted with fury and insist they are being unfairly treated because they have no links to the Kremlin. \u201c[The energy department] has effectively excluded L1 Energy from acquiring energy assets in the (UK Continental Shelf). L1 Energy reserves all its rights regarding DECC\u2019s decision on this issue including, if a decision is issued, to challenge it as being unlawful,\u201d they said at the time. LetterOne is a private company formally based in Luxembourg and has no Russian state connection. In fact it bought Dea for \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.6bn) with cash obtained when it was put under pressure to sell its 50% stake in Siberian producer, TNK-BP, to Kremlin-controlled Rosneft. Many industry experts were surprised to see Browne, who until recently was a senior adviser to the British government, agree to head up L1. But friends say the former BP chief executive is genuinely excited about the prospects of building a new oil and gas business from scratch.",

      "body": "<p>The Russian oligarchs in dispute with the British government over their move to buy a series of North Sea oil and gas fields are now considering whether to back down and sell the assets.</p> <p>The LetterOne Group, led by Mikhail Fridman, is hiring financial advisers to help look at a variety of options for the fields, which were acquired when the company bought the Dea oil and gas firm from Germany\u2019s RWE utility.</p> <p>The Russians, who have brought in former BP boss John Browne to head up their new subsidiary, L1 Energy, which will oversee Dea, had previously warned they may sue the Department of Energy and Climate Change.</p> <p>But sources confirmed that Fridman and his colleagues, including the former TNK-BP director German Khan, are now looking at an outright sale or asset swap in what would be a victory for Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary. </p> <p>They are said to be keen to avoid a confrontation, which could prove costly and time consuming, at a time when they are keen to build a substantial new oil business run by Lord Browne. </p> <p>No formal decision has yet been made on a sale, the sources insisted, but LetterOne want an investment bank or other financial adviser to properly assess a range of options, including offloading the 12 North Sea fields.</p> <p>The row had blown up due to deteriorating relations between the Russian state and the west over Crimea and Ukraine. The British government is concerned that if tougher sanctions were imposed against the Kremlin in future the UK\u2019s own oil and gas supplies could be endangered if they were controlled by a Russian-led company.</p> <p>The DECC is worried about what happened when sanctions were imposed on Iran, which led in 2010 to the temporary shutdown of the North Sea Rhum field co-owned by BP and the state-owned National Iranian Oil Company. </p> <p>Davey said last month he was \u201cminded\u201d to require that the Dea offshore fields, which provide as much as 5% of the UK\u2019s gas output, be passed on to a suitable third party. The oligarchs originally reacted with fury and insist they are being unfairly treated because they have no links to the Kremlin. <br></p> <p>\u201c[The energy department] has effectively excluded L1 Energy from acquiring energy assets in the (UK Continental Shelf). L1 Energy reserves all its rights regarding DECC\u2019s decision on this issue including, if a decision is issued, to challenge it as being unlawful,\u201d they said at the time. </p> <p>LetterOne is a private company formally based in Luxembourg and has no Russian state connection. In fact it bought Dea for \u20ac5bn (\u00a33.6bn) with cash obtained when it was put under pressure to sell its 50% stake in Siberian producer, TNK-BP, to Kremlin-controlled Rosneft.</p> <p>Many industry experts were surprised to see Browne, who until recently was a senior adviser to the British government, agree to head up L1. But friends say the former BP chief executive is genuinely excited about the prospects of building a new oil and gas business from scratch. </p>",

      "bodyText": "A strong pound has increased the chance of a prolonged period of very low inflation, leaving the Bank of England in no hurry to raise interest rates, its senior policymakers suggested. The Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee said stronger growth prospects for the UK and a \u20ac1.1tn quantitative easing programme in the eurozone could push the pound higher. UK inflation is at an-all time low of 0.3% and is expected to turn negative in the coming months for the first time in more than half a century. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, has insisted this will not amount to a period of dangerous deflation, where prices falls become entrenched. However, minutes of the March MPC meeting showed members are now concerned that a persistently strong pound could keep inflation well below the Bank\u2019s 2% target for a prolonged period. The MPC noted: \u201cThough monetary policy at home and abroad was only one of the many factors that influenced the exchange rate, especially in the near term, there was a risk that divergent monetary policy trends, as well as stronger prospects for growth in the United Kingdom than in the euro area, might continue to put upward pressure on the sterling exchange rate. \u201cThis had the potential to prolong the period for which CPI inflation would remain below the target and exacerbate the risk that lower expectations of inflation might become more persistent.\u201d Persistently low inflation would lessen the likelihood of a rise in interest rates, which have been on hold at 0.5% for six years. James Knightley, economist at ING, said: \u201cThe tone of the minutes suggest that the Bank of England is in no hurry to raise rates.\u201d Economists are betting the first increase in rates is most likely in the first half of 2016. The MPC concluded: \u201cThe persistence of ... headwinds, together with the legacy of the financial crisis, meant that Bank rate was expected to remain below average historical levels for some time to come. \u201cThere was a range of views over the most likely path of Bank rate in future, but all members agreed that it was more likely than not that Bank rate would increase over the next three years.\u201d The nine-strong committee voted unanimously in favour of leaving rates on hold at 0.5% and QE unchanged at \u00a3375bn. However, it noted the decision was \u201cfinely balanced\u201d for two members, suggesting the MPC\u2019s two former dissenters, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, were not far off voting for a rate increase. The March decision marked the sixth anniversary of record low rates and the unprecedented introduction of QE. The MPC suggested there were elements of concern in the second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP, which showed business investment fell at the fastest rate in almost six years. \u201cThe expenditure breakdown of GDP growth in 2014 Q4 had given some pause for thought. But there were reasons to remain confident that the continued expansion envisaged in the Committee\u2019s February projections was broadly on track.\u201d",
