      "bodyText": "Waitrose became the third big supermarket to warn of lower profits this year, joining Morrisons and Tesco in admitting that results will fall below expectations. New figures issued on Friday showed that Aldi has leapfrogged Waitrose to become the UK's sixth-largest supermarket, dealing another blow in a relentless campaign against the retail establishment by discounters that has seen the departure of Tesco's chief executive this month. \"We are in a period of unprecedented investment and this will have an impact on the profit we report next month,\" said Waitrose managing director Mark Price. \"We are investing to enable us to compete effectively in this very tough market and to build a strong business for the future.\" Earlier this year, Price said that Waitrose would not be slashing prices to compete with the discounters, but wanted to become \"everything the discounters aren't\". There are plans for 30 \"grazing\" bars where shoppers can enjoy deli food or freshly baked cakes, and investing in matching the prices of its main rivals, such as Tesco, which have been making price cuts. It will also offer special deals to members of its MyWaitrose loyalty card scheme. It has 4.5 million members, up from fewer than 1 million a year ago, after it began offering free tea or coffee on every visit to the store. But Waitrose said the scheme was not responsible for the half-year drop in profits because the business was investing less in MyWaitrose than this time last year. Price said Waitrose had ended the half-year strongly after suffering a few tough weeks in which sales fell back year-on-year as it struggled to top a strong period in 2013 when it was offering special money-off vouchers. Sales for the week to 26 July were up 6.7% on a year before, well ahead of the general grocery market. Full details of the group's first-half results are scheduled to be revealed on 11 September. A year ago the business reported a 13% rise in operating profits to \u00a3160m. Price's revelations about the likely profits hit for Waitrose this year come as the latest market share data shows Aldi is now the UK's sixth-largest supermarket. Market analysts Nielsen found Aldi controlled 5.2% of the market compared with Waitrose's 5% in the 12 weeks to 19 July. Nielsen said that the discounters were being visited by 14% more people than a year ago as Aldi and Lidl continue to outperform the market with sales increases of 25% and 17%, respectively. A spokeswoman for Waitrose said it was still gaining market share and was not losing out to the discounters. \"This is a story of the squeezed middle, with Aldi's gains coming almost entirely at the expense of the big four. We continue to outperform the market and have more customers than ever before,\" she said. But Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said that fresh food such as fruit and vegetables were now emerging as a new battleground with Aldi and Lidl, which were beginning to tackle an area that traditional supermarkets, especially Waitrose, have dominated. \"The discounters have been very effective at stealing share for packaged goods \u2013 such as cans, packets and bottles. If they can also eat into fresh foods, which account for almost half of food and drink sales, we could see a seismic shift in the sector over the next six months,\" he said. The big four supermarkets have already been forced to cut prices on basics such as bread and milk, with Morrisons promising \u00a31bn of price cuts and product improvements over the next few years and Tesco slashing more than \u00a3200m from prices so far this year. While Asda and Sainsbury's have managed to retain their market share and Waitrose continues to gain, Tesco and Morrisons are in retreat.",

      "bodyText": "How are those super, soaraway Royal Mail shares doing? Not so soaraway. Priced at 330p at flotation, the stock hit 600p in January but touched 415p this week, the lowest they have traded. The market has had a serious rethink about prospects. This does not mean business secretary Vince Cable was right all along about the Royal Mail's valuation. The silliness of privatisation lay in the sale of 60% of the shares in one go. It would have been much better to sell in stages: slip out 20% initially and allow the market, rather than ministers and civil servants led by City advisers, to assess the right price. That argument can be put on the shelf until Lord Myners offers a view in his report on privatisations in the autumn. The question now is why Royal Mail's shares are falling so rapidly. Three reasons are obvious. Competition has stiffened in the parcels market across Europe; Amazon in Britain is delivering more of its parcels itself; and Royal Mail's GLS operation in France is one of several companies suspected of anti-competitive practices. All could be filed under everyday thrills and spills. A fourth factor should concern everybody, not only shareholders. It is the seemingly haphazard way in which competition is being injected into the UK letter delivery business, especially the end-to-end market where new entrants can use their own postmen to cover \"the final mile\". \"Direct delivery is in reality not level playing field competition that brings benefits to consumers,\" complains Royal Mail. \"Rather it is 'cherry picking' arbitrage.\" That is a self-interested view but it is persuasive. Royal Mail's obligation to deliver to every address in Britain six days a week at a uniform price \u2013 the Universal Service Obligation, or USO \u2013 relies on cross-subsidies. The lucrative bits, such as serving densely populated cities, subsidise deliveries to rural areas. If rivals have a free hand to operate only in cities, and to deliver only pre-sorted utility bills and bank statements, the USO will become unstable at some point. Royal Mail has been a tizzy ever since TNT Post, which operates an every-other-day service, announced plans to cover 42% of UK addresses, but only 8.5% of the UK geography, by 2017. TNT postmen are already on the beat in London, Liverpool and Manchester. Ofcom, the postal regulator, points out that end-to-end letter competition was less than 1% of market volumes in March this year and that it will assess any \"emerging threat\" to the USO. Okay, but what's missing here is a clear vision of how many cherries it is safe to remove, and how quickly, in the interests of kicking Royal Mail to keep modernising. Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene complains that without regulatory intervention she won't be able to achieve the 5%-10% profit margin deemed sufficient to protect the USO. She may be exaggerating \u2013 bosses of regulated utilities have form on that score. But her broad argument that cross-subsidies, once lost, are hard to restore seems correct. Ofcom should get on with its review now, not wait until the end of next year. Standard Chartered Standard Chartered has already told us that its first-half figures next Wednesday will be horrible. The emerging markets bank warned last month of a fall of about 20% in operating profits caused by weak markets in India, Korea and Singapore plus a jump in bad loans by \"a high-teens percentage\". The share price also looks horrible. In March last year, when Standard was completing a decade of unbroken growth in revenues and profits, it was \u00a318. Now it is \u00a312.22, a price first seen as long ago as 2006. Naturally, some shareholders are asking how a bank that breezed through the financial crisis can take such a tumble in gentler climes. Emerging markets \u2013 or some of them \u2013 have weakened, but is this a case of management losing its grip? Did the $667m (\u00a3396m) penalty for breaching US sanctions on Iran throw the organisation into confusion? If so, should chairman Sir John Peace or chief executive Peter Sands let somebody else have a go? Fund managers' muttering is undeniable but it is hard to make an overwhelming case for boardroom change at this point. Sands neglected to charm his investors during the glory years, leaving the job to now departed finance director Richard Meddings, but he has accumulated credit for Standard's 2007-2012 record. As for Peace, he got it plainly wrong on remuneration (there was a 40% shareholder rebellion at Standard's annual meeting) and needs to rectify the mistake of setting overly short-term targets, but it's not obvious that a change of chairman would improve operations on the ground. Sands and Peace are clearly determined to stay. Assuming no fresh surprises on Wednesday, they probably have a year to get the show back on the road. Banking ethics The best argument for making bankers swear an oath of good behaviour is the possibilities for entertainment. There could be an annual event, a bit like Trooping the Colour, with a regiment of Barclays forex traders marching behind a company of RBS small business consultants. The Bank of England governor would take a salute as the assembled workers give a mass chant of \"we promise to be nice\" and their bosses pledge to polish their tier-one capital ratios. The oath idea, promoted by think-tank ResPublica, is nonsense. Nobody would take such pledges seriously since good behaviour in banking is demonstrated by deeds, not pious declarations. The supposed golden age of gentlemanly bankers whose word was their bond was riddled with insider trading. In recent times cuddly old Co-op Bank traded on its claimed ethical superiority but still pumped out payment protection insurance with the rest of them. HSBC used to be terribly proud of its upright reputation but still forgot to erect money-laundering controls to prevent Mexican drug cartels laundering billions of dollars through its branches. Tougher regulation, better laws and more prosecutions are the way forward. A criminal offence of \"reckless banking\", as proposed by regulators, would be a useful deterrent, whatever the practical difficulties of securing convictions. Oaths are flim-flam. Ideas for Tesco An idea for Dave Lewis, incoming boss of Tesco: study that BT sharesave scheme paying out an average of \u00a342,000 to participants and see if you can invent a souped-up version. These schemes only work so spectacularly as motivational tools when they start by catching a low in the share price. BT in 2009 was at an all-time low and the price has improved fivefold since then, which is why the payout numbers are so large. Tesco, even with a following wind, would struggle to double in value in five years, even from its shrunken share price of 253p. But perhaps shop-floor staff could be offered deeper discounts on their shares, or straightforward cash payments instead if profit targets are met. Something needs to happen to reverse the sense of drift.",

Regional board members - who are in turn elected from area committees - were emailed by former Co-op chairman Len Wardle last month to warn them about the problems with the current reform proposals. He had said the proposals would \"remove any effective member control from the Co-operative Group\". Co-op's interim results are due on September 4 and it is not clear if the board can call a vote of the members before then on the latest plans being drawn up. The Co-op is not expect to begin formally recruiting a new chief executive to replace Euan Sutherland - who quit in March when details of his \u00a36.6m two year pay deal was leaked to the Observer - until the governance changes are agreed.",

Payrolls rose 209,000 and there were a net 15,000 upward revisions, but this is still a bit softer than the 230,000 consensus. There was worse news on the unemployment rate front. It actually rose to 6.2% from 6.1% - the market was looking for it to stay at 6.1%, but we were thinking a sub-6% figure was possible... All in all we got today\u2019s report wrong, but we are still very comfortable with our view that labour market slack is shrinking and the improving growth outlook will keep that trend in place. As the pool of available labour continues to shrink we will see wages respond positively and inflation pressures within the economy will build. Consequently, we look for the Federal Reserve\u2019s commentary to gradually shift in the months ahead and favour an early 2Q15 rate hike.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FXPro, </strong>says that investors are expecting interest rates to rise sooner than they thought.<strong><br></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The labour market in the US is improving as can be seen on a weekly basis, as well as the monthly nonfarm payrolls. Despite <em>today\u2019s hiccup in average earnings*</em>, Thursday\u2019s employment cost index was higher than expected, setting off a few alarm bells at the Fed and this will all translate into a stronger US economy.</p> <p> This week concludes with investors becoming more fractious, not only due to rising geopolitical tensions, but because of the realisation that interest rates are likely to rise sooner than many had previously thought. Both equity and FX volatility has spiked dramatically in the past few days and equity markets in particular have been hit hard. The dollar strength that established itself in July has continued into August, for sterling and the euro, their dizzy highs against the dollar only a few weeks ago seem a long way off now. GBPUSD in particular looks like it\u2019s fallen off a cliff since mid-July.</p> <p>*Average earnings showed 2% annual growth, below expectations.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tanweer Akram, senior economist at Voya Investment Management</strong>, thinks that the Federal Reserve\u2019s open markets committee is likely to scale back its asset purchase programme at a \u201cmeasured\u201d pace. <br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Though slack remains in the U.S. labor market and mostly low valued added and low paying jobs are being created, labor market indicators, such as the hires rate and job openings rate, are gradually improving... However the pace of economic growth in the first half of the year has been disappointing with housing activity showing limited progress. <br></p> </blockquote> <p><strong><br></strong><br><strong><br></strong><br><strong><br></strong><br><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53db8a6fe4b0092d79960018\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-01T12:50:21.635Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a round-up of the best instant reaction to the US jobs data<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/statuses/495186062185357313\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>All told, this is pretty much the payrolls report most were expecting.

The key figure for wider-economy watchers is that the rate of manufacturing job creation has slipped to its lowest rate in 9 months. </p> <p>The large falls in the jobless rate has been the stick with which the Bank of England has been beaten up with in a bid to get them to raise interest rates this year; a softening of that pressure in jobs markets will help the Bank of England maintain its current poise.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The bottom line from this figure is that the relatively rapid acceleration in growth seen in the first half of 2014 will ebb over the second half of the year.

This suggests that the sector is expanding at its slowest rate in 12 months. It is a little disappointing, but it remains at historically high levels and still points to an acceleration in official manufacturing output growth, which is due for release next week.<br>  It is possible that concerns over potential Bank of England interest rate rises are weighing a little, as they clearly were on this week\u2019s consumer confidence number, while the Ukraine situation may also be making firms a little nervous about expanding output. Sterling strength could also be something of an issue too. Nonetheless, it is important to remember that this index is still firmly in expansion territory and that the slack in the economy continues to be eroded. Furthermore, upward GDP revisions due in late September are likely to indicate that the amount of spare capacity is smaller than previously thought and so we are comfortable with our November BoE rate hike prediction.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53db5027e4b0a2344ae6edfe\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-01T08:33:01.639Z\">9.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK manufacturing growth unexpectedly slows to lowest rate in a year</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Big miss: British manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in a year in July, the Markit/CIPS survey showed.

A combination of concerns was behind the declines, from Argentina\u2019s default, the sanctions on Russia, the violence in Gaza and the state of eurozone banks after the huge losses at Espirito Santo revealed this week. The other major factor was the prospect of US interest rates rising more quickly than expected, following better than expected GDP figures and a hawkish outlook from Fed member Charles Prosser. But the weaker than forecast US non-farm payroll numbers (coverage from here) took some of the steam out of that market fear.

Fresh news is coming out of the US on Argentina\u2019s debt default this week. In a court hearing, the judge at the centre of Argentina\u2019s legal battle with so-called holdout bondholders \u2013 which it calls \u201cvulture funds\u201d \u2013 has accused the South American country of releasing \u201cmisleading information\u201d. US judge, Thomas Griesa, criticised Argentina for telling what he called \u201chalf truths\u201d by saying it had met debt obligations. To recap, Argentina technically defaulted on its debt obligations for the second time in 13 years this week after last-minute talks with creditors in New York failed to reach a deal. The country has been locked in a decade-long dispute with hold-out investors \u2013 a group of US hedge funds led by billionaire Paul Singer\u2019s NML Capital, an affiliate of Elliott Management. The vast majority of Argentina\u2019s bondholders agreed to debt restructuring deals in 2005 and 2010 following its 2001 default, wiping off more than 70% of the value of their investment but securing regular interest payments. But the holdout investors refused the restructuring and are demanding repayment in full. Griesa has ruled Argentina cannot pay its other creditors their interest payments without also paying the holdouts more than $1.5bn. Argentina says it has not actually defaulted because it tried to pay the latest interest instalment due to the majority of its creditors. It deposited $539m (\u00a3319m) due to holders of restructured bonds on 30 June but the move was blocked, however, by Griesa. Today he said a settlement was the only was to resolve the case. Reuters reports from the hearing in New York, the Griesa said: \u201cNothing that has happened this week has removed the necessity of working out a settlement.\u201d He is also quoted as saying: \u201cThe republic has issued public statements that have been highly misleading, and that has to be stopped.\u201d and \u201cHalf-truths are not the same as the truth.\u201d Argentina\u2019s lawyer Jonathan Blackman, meanwhile says the country is committed to a dialogue and \u201cagrees with the court that a settlement is the only way to resolve\u201d the dispute. Separately, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) effectively declared Argentina in default. Back to the UK and the debate around when interest rates will start to rise after their long stretch at record low 0.5%. People\u2019s expectations for inflation over the next year, watched closely by Bank of England policymakers, have edged up slightly, according to a poll. Inflation expectations for the next 12 months were up to 2.2% in July, from 2.1% in June, according to a monthly YouGov survey. Inflation expectations for the next five to 10 years were unchanged at 3% in July. Reuters reports: \u201cWhile the medians are little changed, expectations that inflation will be positive but low are becoming more widespread,\u201d said Michael Saunders, chief UK economist at Citi, which sponsors the poll. \u201cFewer people expect no inflation, falling prices or relatively high inflation. All of this is benign from the (Bank of England\u2019s) point of view.\u201d The Bank\u2019s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets next week and economists expect no change in policy for now. But with the recovery seemingly becoming more entrenched, markets are pricing in the first rate hike by the turn of the year. The latest official numbers on inflation showed it at a five-month high of 1.9% in June, just below the Bank\u2019s government-set target of 2.0% on the consumer price index (CPI) measure. Those ISM numbers from the US follow a separate report for the UK showing its manufacturers suffered a slowdown, with activity rising at the slowest pace in a year in July. Surveys in the eurozone also painted a worsening picture there. In the US the headline activity reading beat expectations with support from jobs and from new orders. The report\u2019s employment component jumped to 58.2 in July from 52.8 in June, hitting its highest since June 2011. New orders rose to 63.4 from 58.9. A reading above 50 shows expansion. Reacting to the report, James Knightley, economist at ING Financial Markets said it brings some welcome cheer after today\u2019s earlier non-farm payrolls report missed expectations. He comments: After that pretty poor employment report we have actually got a very robust ISM manufacturing index... Interestingly, the employment component surged to 58.2 from 52.8, taking it to its highest level since June 2011, contradicting today\u2019s softish jobs numbers. Production is up ... while new orders jumped nearly 5 points to 63.4. This is all really good news for the US growth story with the headline ISM index at levels historically consistent with GDP growth running at 4% year-on-year versus the current rate of 2.4%. It also backs up our positive assessment on the US economy and our view that the labour market will continue to strengthen , inflation pressures will build, the dollar will rally a lot further and the Fed will tighten earlier than the market currently anticipates. The US is the latest country to report manufacturing data this afternoon and numbers from the world\u2019s biggest economy have topped expectations. The US manufacturing sector expanded at its fastest pace in more than three years in July, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Its index of factory activity rose to 57.1 from 55.3 in June. That was the highest since April 2011 and beat the consensus forecast for a reading of 56.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. More details and reaction to follow... Markets are peculiar things. Although the jobs data came in worse than expected, US stock futures have pared their losses, while US Treasury yields have fallen. This is because investors are more hopeful that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates low for longer. The FTSE100 has recovered some earlier losses, but remains 0.92% (6668 points) down on the day The Guardian\u2019s story: US adds 209,000 jobs in July as unemployment rate rises to 6.2% More reaction on US non-farm payrolls James Knightley at ING Bank sounds underwhelmed, but thinks the outlook for the labour market is improving. The US labour report for July is a bit disappointing really. Payrolls rose 209,000 and there were a net 15,000 upward revisions, but this is still a bit softer than the 230,000 consensus. There was worse news on the unemployment rate front. It actually rose to 6.2% from 6.1% - the market was looking for it to stay at 6.1%, but we were thinking a sub-6% figure was possible... All in all we got today\u2019s report wrong, but we are still very comfortable with our view that labour market slack is shrinking and the improving growth outlook will keep that trend in place. As the pool of available labour continues to shrink we will see wages respond positively and inflation pressures within the economy will build. Consequently, we look for the Federal Reserve\u2019s commentary to gradually shift in the months ahead and favour an early 2Q15 rate hike. Angus Campbell, senior analyst at FXPro, says that investors are expecting interest rates to rise sooner than they thought. The labour market in the US is improving as can be seen on a weekly basis, as well as the monthly nonfarm payrolls. Despite today\u2019s hiccup in average earnings*, Thursday\u2019s employment cost index was higher than expected, setting off a few alarm bells at the Fed and this will all translate into a stronger US economy. This week concludes with investors becoming more fractious, not only due to rising geopolitical tensions, but because of the realisation that interest rates are likely to rise sooner than many had previously thought. Both equity and FX volatility has spiked dramatically in the past few days and equity markets in particular have been hit hard. The dollar strength that established itself in July has continued into August, for sterling and the euro, their dizzy highs against the dollar only a few weeks ago seem a long way off now. GBPUSD in particular looks like it\u2019s fallen off a cliff since mid-July. *Average earnings showed 2% annual growth, below expectations. Tanweer Akram, senior economist at Voya Investment Management, thinks that the Federal Reserve\u2019s open markets committee is likely to scale back its asset purchase programme at a \u201cmeasured\u201d pace. Though slack remains in the U.S. labor market and mostly low valued added and low paying jobs are being created, labor market indicators, such as the hires rate and job openings rate, are gradually improving... However the pace of economic growth in the first half of the year has been disappointing with housing activity showing limited progress. Here is a round-up of the best instant reaction to the US jobs data It\u2019s time to get out the data charts and dust off the superlatives. And my personal favourite... Participation in the workforce ticked up to 62.9%, from 62.8% in June. The US jobless rate was 6.2% in July, slightly off expectations. Breaking news: the US gained 209,000 non-farm jobs in July, lower than expectations of 233,000. But June\u2019s figure was revised up: statisticians now say that the US created 298,000 non-farm jobs in June, against a previous estimate of 288,000. Hot off the wires: France\u2019s prime minister Manuel Valls has warned that the eurozone faces a real risk of deflation. And with the country about to pack up and go on holiday, he also warned that France would face a difficult economic situation in the autumn. I\u2019ll add more when I get it, but meantime here are some highlights from Reuters\u2019 politics and economics correspondent in Paris The speech isn\u2019t impressing everyone. Hello, Jennifer Rankin taking over while we await the US jobs data. And here is a tasty lunchtime story. Waitrose has warned that the free coffees and newspapers it hands out to customers will cut its profits. The upmarket grocer, the UK\u2019s sixth largest supermarket, has been gaining market share, but now discounter Aldi is snapping at its heels in the supermarket pecking order. The FT has a good take on the story. Mark Price, Waitrose\u2019s managing director, said the supermarket had put substantial investment into its loyalty card programme, which allows customers free tea and coffee and a newspaper if they spend more than \u00a35. As you know, we are in a period of unprecedented investment and this will have an impact on the profit we report next month. The scheme has been popular, but supposedly criticised by some customers, who think it attracts the wrong kind of shopper. Even David Cameron weighed into the debate earlier this year, after Labour accused it of damaging the interests of independent traders. So these are the big issues of British politics: bacon sandwiches and freebie coffees... It\u2019s midday \u2013 time for another look at the markets and a round-up of today\u2019s main news. Financial markets have started August in the red amid worries over the global economy, interest rate hikes, Argentina, Ukraine and Gaza. The FTSE 100 index in London is down nearly 100 points at 6633.60, a 1.4% fall. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost just over 2% and France\u2019s CAC is off 1.4%. At 1.30pm, we will get US non-farm payrolls, which are expected to show some 230,000 new jobs were created in the economy in July, down from June\u2019s strong number of 288,000. People will be watching the earnings figures for any signs of a pick-up in inflation, as this is crucial to the interest rate outlook with the Fed getting more concerned about rising inflation. India has blocked a landmark global trade deal, which could prove fatal for the World Trade Organisation UK and eurozone manufacturing growth disappointed in July amid rising tensions in Ukraine The ISDA trade body will rule at 4pm BST whether Argentina\u2019s default is a \u2018credit event. US judge Thomas Griesa, who has been hearing the case, has called a meeting at the same time to discuss Argentina\u2019s \u201crecent default\u201d The World Trade Organisation has reached its make or break moment, writes our economics correspondent Larry Elliott. Obituaries for the World Trade Organisation have been prepared many times over the past decade but proved premature. This time they may be needed. Make no mistake, the failure of the WTO\u2018s members to ratify a deal designed to streamline customs\u2019 procedures by preventing needless delays and corruption at borders is a massive setback to the multilateral trading system. It paves the way for countries to cut their own bilateral or regional deals. For the WTO, it threatens to be fatal. Returning to our earlier topic, the breakdown of the world trade talks, Reuters has compiled a list of nine reasons why India\u2019s decision to block a landmark deal shocked the world. Its refusal to sign the agreement drawn up last December in Bali to streamline global customs procedures is a serious blow to the World Trade Organisation, which was set up 19 years ago. Trade diplomats in Geneva have said they are \u201cflabbergasted\u201d, \u201castonished\u201d and \u201cdismayed\u201d and described India\u2019s position as \u201chostage-taking\u201d and \u201csuicidal\u201d. Having read up on it, I\u2019m baffled. Click here for more In corporate news, Royal Bank of Scotland warned this morning that profits could by hit by the ongoing investigation into potential manipulation of the foreign exchange markets, our banking correspondent Jill Treanor reports. You can read the full story here. In 17 pages of legal disclosures attached to its first-half results, the 81% taxpayer-owned bank revealed the cost of fines or settlements that could come with the wide-ranging inquiry could be \u201cmaterial\u201d. The bank issued its results last Friday \u2013 a week earlier than expected \u2013 after an improvement in bad debts drove profits to their highest levels since the bailout in 2008. As the Edinburgh-based bank confirmed the rise in profits to \u00a32.6bn, it published information about its performance in the first half of the year along with details about the risks and litigation it could face. But it did not take any additional provisions for the potential cost. Artificial hips-and-knees maker Smith &amp; Nephew \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest maker of artificial joints \u2013 said it would offer Americans a new \u201cno frills\u201d service that will slash the cost of buying its replacement hips and knees. Chief executive Olivier Bohuon said the new Syncera service should appeal to 5-10% of US hospitals that cannot afford its full service. By stripping out some traditional costs, such as sending a company technician to attend surgery, he said overall costs could be slashed by 40-50%. The company shrugged off problems in its wound management division to post a 10% rise in group trading profits to $255m in the second quarter, an improvement after a weak start to the year. July trading ended on a sour note, observes Daniel Sugarman, market strategist at ETX Capital. Markets plunged worldwide as Argentina\u2019s debt default, Russian tension, Portuguese banking fears and a highly negative Chicago Purchasing Managers Index Reading (52.6) all came together in an unholy mix, with markets giving up all gains made over the course of the month \u2013 and in some cases, in the course of the whole year so far. An example of the latter was the Dow, which fell by 317 points (1.88%) over the course of the day\u2019s trading. The S&amp;P was down by 2% while the Nasdaq was down 2.1%. The effects rolled across to Asian markets, with the Nikkei down by 0.63%, the Hang Seng down by 0.91% and the Shanghai Composite down 0.74%. European markets are also feeling the pinch this morning. US Non-farm payroll figures are out later today and markets will be hanging onto the results, with good numbers having the potential to help markets rally somewhat whilst bad numbers might herald an even greater fall. More reaction to the UK manufacturing slowdown. David Richardson, head of manufacturing at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, mid markets, said: While some of the forward momentum has slowed, the overall performance of the manufacturing sector so far this year has been positive. The country\u2019s makers have offered a robust source of job creation and export activity, in the face of a strengthening sterling. For us, it has been pleasing to see our manufacturing customers invest in state-of-the-art plant and machinery, drive efficiencies and fund cutting-edge R&amp;D, which are all critical to the development of a high value manufacturing economy. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency company World First said: Manufacturing growth in the UK remains at a solid but not spectacular level into Q3 of this year. While overall output has remained strong, the speed and pace of improvement has started to slow. The key figure for wider-economy watchers is that the rate of manufacturing job creation has slipped to its lowest rate in 9 months. The large falls in the jobless rate has been the stick with which the Bank of England has been beaten up with in a bid to get them to raise interest rates this year; a softening of that pressure in jobs markets will help the Bank of England maintain its current poise. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: The bottom line from this figure is that the relatively rapid acceleration in growth seen in the first half of 2014 will ebb over the second half of the year. The lower reading than previously shouldn\u2019t set off any alarm bells as the indicator is still consistent with a decent pace of growth across the sector and, continued prospects for more job creation. The survey also points to companies benefiting from new product developments and efforts to sell into emerging markets. Nevertheless the patchy industrial performance across Europe, initial signs of some cost pressures emerging and, capacity issues in the supply chain could yet weigh on the sector in the coming months. The FTSE was down 80 points when the manufacturing survey data came out, and is now trading nearly 70 points lower at 660.44, a 1% fall. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 1.7% and France\u2019s CAC is 1.2% lower. Markit said manufacturing growth remains strong by historical standards and the slowdown is in line with the Bank of England\u2019s forecast that the economic recovery will slow a tad in coming months. But the drop may also reflect uncertainty about the worsening crisis in Ukraine. Growth in new factory orders hit a four-month low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: It remains too early to gauge the impact of the Ukraine crisis, but the worry is that the combined effects of expected policy tightening, heightened economic uncertainty and sluggish trade could mean manufacturing growth could suddenly weaken more than expected. Many City economists expect the Bank of England to hike interest rates around the turn of the year. Here\u2019s some instant reaction to the UK factory data from James Knightley, UK economist at ING in London. The UK manufacturing PMI survey has dropped from 57.2 to 55.4 in July, weaker than the 57.2 consensus. This suggests that the sector is expanding at its slowest rate in 12 months. It is a little disappointing, but it remains at historically high levels and still points to an acceleration in official manufacturing output growth, which is due for release next week. It is possible that concerns over potential Bank of England interest rate rises are weighing a little, as they clearly were on this week\u2019s consumer confidence number, while the Ukraine situation may also be making firms a little nervous about expanding output. Sterling strength could also be something of an issue too. Nonetheless, it is important to remember that this index is still firmly in expansion territory and that the slack in the economy continues to be eroded. Furthermore, upward GDP revisions due in late September are likely to indicate that the amount of spare capacity is smaller than previously thought and so we are comfortable with our November BoE rate hike prediction. Big miss: British manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in a year in July, the Markit/CIPS survey showed. The purchasing managers\u2019 index for July dropped to 55.4 from 57.2 in June \u2013 its lowest level since July 2013 and well below what economists were expecting. Overall eurozone manufacturing growth failed to pick up as expected last month amid the worsening stand-off between Ukraine and Russia. Markit\u2019s final July manufacturing PMI held steady at 51.8 but was slightly below an earlier flash estimate of 51.9. A sub-index measuring output alone dipped to 52.7 from June\u2019s 52.8. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: The situation in the eurozone has clearly worsened from the promising signs of economic revival seen earlier in the year. He said the final reading was lower than the flash estimate most likely reflecting growing concerns following the escalation of the crisis in Ukraine towards the end of the month. Price pressures in factories across the eurozone remain muted. The output price gauge, which measures the prices charged by manufacturers, fell to 50.1 from 50.4. The eurozone purchasing managers\u2019 surveys are also out this morning. Here\u2019s a quick round-up. Germany\u2019s index has come in at 52.4, slightly worse than expected (52.9), but it\u2019s an improvement on June. In France, factory activity worsened with the PMI falling to 47.8, a seven-month low, from 48.2 in June. The Italian manufacturing index dropped to an eight-month low. In Spain, the index has slipped slightly to 53.9 from 54.6, but remains pretty strong. Anything above 50 indicates expansion in the sector; anything below points to contraction. European stock markets have fallen back further ahead of the US jobs numbers this afternoon. The FTSE 100 index in London has lost nearly 45 points, or 0.6%, to 6687.45 while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC are off nearly 1%. Here in the UK, after a few quiet days the main focus today will be on July\u2019s manufacturing PMI at 9.30am BST, which will provide an update on business conditions at the start of the third quarter. Economists at Daiwa say expectations are for a modest drop in the headline index, although at 57.2 it will continue to point to robust expansion. Inflationary pressures in the eurozone are also rising, suggesting efforts by the European Central Bank to fight deflation are working. They have reached a 27-month high, according to the Eurozone Future Inflation Gauge, which is published by the Economic Cycle Research Institute. It rose to 96.7 in June from 96.2 in April. According to official figures released on Thursday, annual inflation in the eurozone dropped to just 0.4% in July, the lowest since the height of the financial crisis in 2009. Hewson at CMC Markets UK believes wages could be interesting in today\u2019s US non-farm payrolls report, given policymakers\u2019 increasing concerns over inflation. The numbers are out at 1.30pm BST. Expectations are for a number of around 232k, but given this week\u2019s slightly disappointing ADP number, it could come in lower. Even if its lower than that as long as the number doesn\u2019t fall below 200k, markets are likely to be fairly relaxed about it, with the US dollar likely to remain strong as it enjoys its best monthly performance in over a year, against a basket of currencies. A strong number will also make it harder for the Fed to argue that there is still a significant amount of slack in the economy, with the unemployment rate set to remain unchanged at 6.1%. As for inflation there has been an awful lot of chatter about the Employment Cost Index which showed a sharp rise of 0.7% in Q2, and is a gauge that reflects how much companies, governments and non-profit institutions pay their employees in wages and benefits. If today\u2019s average hourly earnings data for July shows similar price pressures building up, we could well see further losses on stock markets and further US dollar gains, as investors start to worry about the inflation bogeyman. Expectations are for rise to 2.2% year on year. It\u2019s US non-farm payrolls day. Economists are expecting another chunky increase in the number of jobs created in the economy in July, albeit down from June\u2019s strong 288,000 number. Economists at Daiwa say: Following a bad day for US equity markets yesterday, today\u2019s numerous US releases should make for at least mildly encouraging reading about the outlook for the economy. The most noteworthy figures come from the latest labour market report. Non-farm payrolls are expected to have risen by 230k in July \u2013 a good deal weaker than June\u2019s 288k, but still well in excess of the average over the past year. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is expected to have remained unchanged at the near-six-year low of 6.1%, not least due to the strengthening in the labour market drawing more workers into the labour force. Today also brings the manufacturing ISM, which is expected to indicate a slight further improvement in business conditions at the start of Q3, though a moderate pace of activity in the manufacturing sector should still hold the measure close to the readings in the prior two months. Personal income and spending numbers for June and vehicle sales figures for July are also slated for publication. Most Asian stock markets dipped overnight after the sell-off on Wall Street. Japan\u2019s Nikkei dropped 0.6% to 15,528.72 and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng shed 0.5% to 24,623.81. However losses were less severe than in the US as investors took some hope from upbeat reports on China\u2019s economy. Monthly surveys of manufacturing in China suggested that the economy \u2013 the world\u2019s second-largest \u2013 is responding well to recent mini-stimulus measures. The official purchasing managers\u2019 index measuring activity in China\u2019s factories reached its highest level in 27 months, while a similar report from HSBC showed the fastest rate of improvement in a year and a half. All major stock markets fell on Thursday, and European markets are down again this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 index is off nearly 28 points, or 0.4%, at 6702.71. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, reckons the slide in markets has little to do with Argentina\u2019s woes, and more with the interest rate outlook for the US. A much more probable explanation is likely to be found much closer to home in the prospect that a Fed rate hike is probably nearer than markets had initially thought at the beginning of the week, or the month of July for that matter, due to concerns that the Fed is underestimating inflation. Throw in concerns about the strength of the global economy, China, Europe, the knock on effects of Russian sanctions, and any countermeasures, which could well spill over onto the strength of company earnings, along with the effect falling prices will have on debt to GDP ratios, and I think you\u2019ll find you\u2019ve got a pretty good reason to maybe start taking some money off the table. The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 300 points and closed down 1.9% at 16,563.30, its worst one-day drop since February. The S&amp;P 500 shed 2% to 1,930.67, its biggest drop since April, and the Nasdaq fell 2.1% to 4,369.77 amid disappointing corporate earnings reports. Argentina defaulted on its debt for the second time in 13 years on Thursday, sending the country\u2019s stock market tumbling nearly 7% while the peso lost more than 4% against the dollar. There are two important events today: The International Swaps and Derivatives Association will rule on whether Argentina\u2019s failure to repay its debts before Wednesday night\u2019s deadline is a \u201ccredit event\u201d \u2013 which could trigger credit default swaps (insurance on the bonds) US judge Thomas Griesa, who has been hearing the case, has called a meeting for 11am EST in New York (4pm BST) to discuss Argentina\u2019s \u201crecent default\u201d Azevedo asked WTO members \u201cto reflect long and hard on the ramifications of this setback.\u201d Meanwhile, the US ambassador to the WTO, Michael Punke, said the failure to reach a deal had put \u201cthis institution on very uncertain new ground\u201d. India, for its part, said last year that the agreement could jeopardise its policies to feed its poor. There had been a last-ditch effort by US officials to try and persuade India to agree to a compromise that would have secured a world trade deal. The WTO reached an agreement in December in Bali to standardise customs procedures, and the deadline to ratify that deal was Thursday. India refused to sign without a a parallel agreement giving developing countries more leeway to subsidise and stockpile food. Some economists estimate that the Bali agreement could save WTO members more than $1 trillion, and create 21m jobs, 18m of them in developing countries. WTO director general Roberto Azevedo said: I do not have the necessary elements that would lead to me to conclude that a breakthrough is possible. We got closer\u2014significantly closer\u2014but not quite there. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. We\u2019ve woken up to news that the World Trade Organisation\u2019s 160 members have failed to ratify an agreement designed to streamline the global trade system. It would have been the first comprehensive global trade agreement since the organisation was set up in 1995.",

    "webTitle": "The new breed of shareholder activist: taking on the big boys at the AGM", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was training night at the offices of Share Action in Druid Street, south-east London, and a man named Jo Beardsmore was preparing would-be activists to take on some of the big corporations at their own annual general meetings (AGMs). Jo was telling everybody what to expect: a lot of shareholders turn up just to get the free stuff. You see people decanting jugs of orange juice into their water bottles. (In fact, I knew about this because I had an uncle who, before he died, used to buy 10 shares in each major brewery and give one to each of his nine best friends, then they\u2019d all go to the AGM for a kind of booze hounds\u2019 gala. The salient part of that sentence is \u201cbefore he died\u201d.) In the 1980s, people would buy one share to stage a protest, and for a while it was not unusual for the board to sit behind a Perspex screen in case people tried to egg them. Today, shareholder action is much more strategic. You don\u2019t just buy a share, bowl up with an egg and hope for the best. This training, complete with a role play at the end, basically said: if you want to do this, do it right. Read the company report, or, if you don\u2019t have time, stick stickers in it to make it look as if you have. Plan and rehearse your question. Make it count. Share Action is the most tenacious, nerdily optimistic shareholder action group in the country. Their US counterparts, Sum of Us, have had some concrete successes this year (not least their part in the Burberry pay-packet revolt), but both sometimes sound overwhelmed by the corporate arrogance they are up against. It\u2019s a David and Goliath story all right, in which you can\u2019t help but feel tiny and meaningless, against the 10- or 12-strong line of suits who\u2019ll blithely tell you that they need \u00a34m pay packages in order to attract the best people, but can\u2019t pay the living wage because that would fatally weaken their business proposition. David definitely knows how to use a slingshot, but it\u2019s very hard to say whether Goliath has actually been wounded. The two majorly dispiriting things are these: support for the status quo is massive. You can sit in a room with shareholders noisily heckling the CEO, cheering the person who asks about pay packets; but when it comes to it, they\u2019ll vote for the pay packages the board demands, often by overwhelming majorities. Second, there are a lot of people in the room, spruced up and freshly shaven, who have honestly come down from Shropshire to complain about a customer service guy who was rude to them on the phone, or that the red peppers have been persistently sub-par in their Tesco Local. It just makes you want to scream: \u201cYou people are making us all look like cranks. And after all our evening classes in how to do this properly!\u201d So as the AGM season draws to a close, what exactly happened in 2014? I went to the AGMs of some of the most unpopular, contentious companies \u2013 corporations whose workers were on strike, or who were allegedly implicated in the operation of drones. I wasn\u2019t always allowed in, but normally I was. I got live updates from others, including Royal Mail (whose issue is the open scandal of its pay ratios), and this week Vodafone (who have a case to answer over their reluctance to pay UK corporation tax). In May, I went with Ritzy cinema workers to demand a living wage from Cineworld, the chain\u2019s parent company. In June, I went to Tesco\u2019s to see Amy Bradley (and 11-year-old Lucas Pinco) also ask about the living wage. In July, I went to BT, where Kevin Lo asked about their cables enabling US drone strikes, and Aditi Gupta asked about BT\u2019s role in covert surveillance by the British government. Without exception, the answers were extremely bland. But the point is that the response isn\u2019t the point: the point is that they let the genie out of the bottle. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they would budge that much,\u201d Lo said equably. \u201cBut we walked out on a little bit of a high.\u201d Lo is from Reprieve, and his challenge is this: \u201cBT basically built a comms line between RAF Croughton and a US base in Djibouti that the US military flies drones out of. It\u2019s the core of US drone operation, flying 24/7 into Yemen and Somali. It\u2019s undeclared warfare.\u201d The reply, from BT chairman Michael Rake, was: \u201cWe provide telecommunications to anyone who can pay our bills. We do not look to, nor can we possibly know, how people plan to use their telecommunications equipment. We don\u2019t have knowledge of how you use your telephone, how you use your email\u201d. (This was a little ironic in the light of the surveillance issue.) \u201cThe US government is a customer of the company, they pay their bills, they are legally entitled to our services and we are legally entitled to sell to them.\u201d It was so uncompromising, delivered in such a tetchy, dismissive way, that I took it as defeat. But Lo said the gains were important. \u201cThey made their position so explicit. They\u2019ve always hinted that they didn\u2019t know and they didn\u2019t want to know. Now they\u2019ve said that.\u201d Gupta, whose question was answered in a similarly offhand way, was heartened by support from other shareholders. \u201cI remember saying to Kevin that I was terrified, because I am really scared of public speaking. But once I got up there, I was annoyed that he wasn\u2019t answering my question and all I could think of was how to make him answer.\u201d Catherine Howarth, head of Share Action, said, \u201cPeople say this is one of the most empowering things they\u2019ve ever done. Of course, you don\u2019t get instant satisfaction when you engage power. But just to do something is empowering.\u201d Marc Cowan, two months before, went to Cineworld\u2019s AGM in the Wandsworth multiplex. He and his colleagues have been striking for a living wage from the Ritzy Cinema, a member of the Picturehouse Group, which is owned by Cineworld. He and two others had bought a share; I went as a guest and the woman on the door said, \u201cno guests\u201d, even though she had a giant stack of orange cards marked \u201cguest\u201d. I asked her her name, just to avoid calling her \u201cwoman on the door\u201d and she, taking this for open hostility, called security. It was the most thrilling thing that has happened to me since my May Day riot days. Whether they\u2019re fanning out ahead of Gavin Patterson (chief executive of BT) as he descends the stage, or refusing entry to innocuous though perhaps not very smartly dressed Cineworld employees, security guards tell a truer story than brochures. We are, since automatic pension enrolment, pretty well all shareholders in one or a number of large corporations. But when they say \u201cour duty is to shareholders\u201d, they don\u2019t mean the ones with a handful of shares who might also work for the company. One\u2019s importance as a shareholder is squarely ranked by wealth. Anyway, Marc, having asked his question, got 20 minutes afterwards with Mooky Greidinger (CEO of Cineworld) and Lyn Goleby (CEO of the Picturehouse group). \u201cShe said we were all promising young members of the public, and we could work for them,\u201d he says. \u201cShe offered us a job, basically. And I said: \u2018I have no interest in working for a company that doesn\u2019t respect their staff.\u2019\u201d I thought he already worked for her? \u201cWell, yes, but we\u2019re at the bottom of the ladder. Her view is that if we want to climb, we can climb. And my view is that even the people at the bottom deserve to be paid enough to live on.\u201d The Tesco answer was the one I was expecting the most from, but the one that delivered the least. Lucas Pinco stood up and said: \u201cI hope you remember me from the Tesco AGM three years ago. I was eight, and as you can see, I have grown since then, and so has the Living Wage campaign. We have had some good conversations but now we need to make some concrete progress.\u201d The room was all his. But CEOs have been in this game long enough not to say anything rash just because there\u2019s a kid in the room. Philip Clarke, the group\u2019s chief executice officer, said half-querulously: \u201cThey get more than the living wage, if you include the benefits in the package, a 10% discount on Tesco\u2019s goods. Tesco\u2019s pays its staff 5-8% more than every single one of its competitors.\u201d \u201cHis answer was pre-packaged, well prepared and defensive,\u201d Howarth said afterwards. \u201cThe fact is, the Living Wage campaign does take employee benefits into account, but only when they\u2019re genuinely cash convertible. Not when they\u2019re in the form of a pension, or gym membership.\u201d I find it quite distasteful that they\u2019d include the staff discount, so are effectively paying their workers partly in food. This week Lisa Lindsley, from Sum of Us, told me, \u201cThe status quo unfortunately isn\u2019t static. It\u2019s deteriorating. The shareholder season in the northern hemisphere is almost over. So we\u2019re regrouping to see what to do next. Palm oil will continue to be big, and neonics [the pesticide that is thought to kill bees, and has already been banned in the EU]. Lobbying and corporate political spending will still be a big deal, though that isn\u2019t a problem for you guys. CEO pay and low pay will be on the agenda \u2013 what could be really interesting is if people started proposing a policy of a ratio.\u201d The difficulty is that many of the objections are against the whole structure of the business; it\u2019s taken as a given, since you\u2019re masquerading as a shareholder, that you\u2019re as interested in profit as the board is. But most of the time, the problems stem from putting profit before everything else. As Lindsley says, \u201cFrom the point of view of shareholder value, you can\u2019t ask an oil company to completely stop producing oil. You can\u2019t have a shareholder engagement programme that advocates terminating the business.\u201d The arrogant circularity of market fundamentalism is exhausting to approach; and, more than energy, it also takes courage, to approach it on its own turf. The payoff is rarely immediate or concrete \u2013 but there is a payoff, which is that the terms of engagement are laid out: in order to make a profit, x number of workers have to be paid less than they need to live on; in order to stay \u201cin business\u201d, our CEO has to earn 148 times more than the cleaner. Just to get this said out loud is fundamental to the process of asking whether it\u2019s right or not. Plus, you do get a sandwich, and a tiny share portfolio. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2014 to correct the spelling of Lisa Lindsley\u2019s name.",

(In fact, I knew about this because I had an uncle who, before he died, used to buy 10 shares in each major brewery and give one to each of his nine best friends, then they\u2019d all go to the AGM for a kind of booze hounds\u2019 gala. The salient part of that sentence is \u201cbefore he died\u201d.)</p> <p>In the 1980s, people would buy one share to stage a protest, and for a while it was not unusual for the board to sit behind a Perspex screen in case people tried to egg them. Today, shareholder action is much more strategic. You don\u2019t just buy a share, bowl up with an egg and hope for the best. This training, complete with a role play at the end, basically said: if you want to do this, do it right. Read the company report, or, if you don\u2019t have time, stick stickers in it to make it look as if you have. Plan and rehearse your question. Make it count.</p> <p>Share Action is the most tenacious, nerdily optimistic shareholder action group in the country. Their US counterparts, Sum of Us, have had some concrete successes this year (not least their part in <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/articles/burberry-investors-rebel-over-ceos-pay-1405091150\">the Burberry pay-packet revolt</a>), but both sometimes sound overwhelmed by the corporate arrogance they are up against. It\u2019s a David and Goliath story all right, in which you can\u2019t help but feel tiny and meaningless, against the 10- or 12-strong line of suits who\u2019ll blithely tell you that they need \u00a34m pay packages in order to attract the best people, but can\u2019t pay the living wage because that would fatally weaken their business proposition. David definitely knows how to use a slingshot, but it\u2019s very hard to say whether Goliath has actually been wounded. The two majorly dispiriting things are these: support for the status quo is massive. You can sit in a room with shareholders noisily heckling the CEO, cheering the person who asks about pay packets; but when it comes to it, they\u2019ll vote for the pay packages the board demands, often by overwhelming majorities. Second, there are a lot of people in the room, spruced up and freshly shaven, who have honestly come down from Shropshire to complain about a customer service guy who was rude to them on the phone, or that the red peppers have been persistently sub-par in their Tesco Local. It just makes you want to scream: \u201cYou people are making us all look like cranks. And after all our evening classes in how to do this properly!\u201d</p> <p>So as the AGM season draws to a close, what exactly happened in 2014? I went to the AGMs of some of the most unpopular, contentious companies \u2013 corporations whose workers were on strike, or who were allegedly implicated in the operation of drones. I wasn\u2019t always allowed in, but normally I was. I got live updates from others, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/royal-mail\">Royal Mail</a> (whose issue is the open scandal of its pay ratios), and this week Vodafone (who have a case to answer over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/14/uk-uncut-vodafone\">their reluctance to pay UK corporation tax</a>). In May, I went with <a href=\"http://ritzylivingwage.tumblr.com/\">Ritzy cinema workers to demand a living wage</a> from Cineworld, the chain\u2019s parent company. In June, I went to Tesco\u2019s to see Amy Bradley (and 11-year-old Lucas Pinco) also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/27/uk-growth-figures-awaited-as-tesco-faces-agm-business-live\">ask about the living wage</a>. In July, I went to BT, where Kevin Lo asked about their cables <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/firmsreexamine-links-with-bt-over-drones-8784299.html\">enabling US drone strikes</a>, and Aditi Gupta asked about BT\u2019s role in covert surveillance by the British government. Without exception, the answers were extremely bland.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a633cf13-f271-44bd-9f3f-962e8ba65572\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/1/1406907272531/a6fae232-bb4b-408a-85dd-cc44083b73f5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"At BT's 2014 AGM, Aditi Gupta (left) asked about BT\u2019s role in covert surveillance by the British government, and Kevin Lo asked about their cables enabling US drone strikes. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At BT\u2019s 2014 AGM, Aditi Gupta (left) asked about BT\u2019s role in covert surveillance by the British government, and Kevin Lo (right) asked about their cables enabling US drone strikes. Photograph: Linda Nylind</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the point is that the response isn\u2019t the point: the point is that they let the genie out of the bottle. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they would budge that much,\u201d Lo said equably. \u201cBut we walked out on a little bit of a high.\u201d</p> <p>Lo is from <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/\">Reprieve</a>, and his challenge is this: \u201cBT basically built a comms line between RAF Croughton and a US base in Djibouti that the US military flies drones out of. It\u2019s the core of US drone operation, flying 24/7 into Yemen and Somali. It\u2019s undeclared warfare.\u201d The reply, from BT chairman Michael Rake, was: \u201cWe provide telecommunications to anyone who can pay our bills. We do not look to, nor can we possibly know, how people plan to use their telecommunications equipment. We don\u2019t have knowledge of how you use your telephone, how you use your email\u201d. (This was a little ironic in the light of the surveillance issue.) \u201cThe US government is a customer of the company, they pay their bills, they are legally entitled to our services and we are legally entitled to sell to them.\u201d It was so uncompromising, delivered in such a tetchy, dismissive way, that I took it as defeat. But Lo said the gains were important. \u201cThey made their position so explicit. They\u2019ve always hinted that they didn\u2019t know and they didn\u2019t want to know. Now they\u2019ve said that.\u201d</p> <p>Gupta, whose question was answered in a similarly offhand way, was heartened by support from other shareholders. \u201cI remember saying to Kevin that I was terrified, because I am really scared of public speaking. But once I got up there, I was annoyed that he wasn\u2019t answering my question and all I could think of was how to make him answer.\u201d Catherine Howarth, head of Share Action, said, \u201cPeople say this is one of the most empowering things they\u2019ve ever done. Of course, you don\u2019t get instant satisfaction when you engage power. But just to do something is empowering.\u201d</p> <p>Marc Cowan, two months before, <a href=\"http://shareaction.org/blog/201405/crashing-cineworlds-agm-living-wage\">went to Cineworld\u2019s AGM</a> in the Wandsworth multiplex. He and his colleagues have been striking for a living wage from the Ritzy Cinema, a member of the Picturehouse Group, which is owned by Cineworld. He and two others had bought a share; I went as a guest and the woman on the door said, \u201cno guests\u201d, even though she had a giant stack of orange cards marked \u201cguest\u201d. I asked her her name, just to avoid calling her \u201cwoman on the door\u201d and she, taking this for open hostility, called security. It was the most thrilling thing that has happened to me since my May Day riot days. Whether they\u2019re fanning out ahead of Gavin Patterson (chief executive of BT) as he descends the stage, or refusing entry to innocuous though perhaps not very smartly dressed Cineworld employees, security guards tell a truer story than brochures. We are, since automatic pension enrolment, pretty well all shareholders in one or a number of large corporations. But when they say \u201cour duty is to shareholders\u201d, they don\u2019t mean the ones with a handful of shares who might also work for the company. One\u2019s importance as a shareholder is squarely ranked by wealth.</p> <p>Anyway, Marc, having asked his question, got 20 minutes afterwards with Mooky Greidinger (CEO of Cineworld) and Lyn Goleby (CEO of the Picturehouse group). \u201cShe said we were all promising young members of the public, and we could work for them,\u201d he says. \u201cShe offered us a job, basically. And I said: \u2018I have no interest in working for a company that doesn\u2019t respect their staff.\u2019\u201d I thought he already worked for her? \u201cWell, yes, but we\u2019re at the bottom of the ladder. Her view is that if we want to climb, we can climb. And my view is that even the people at the bottom deserve to be paid enough to live on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-30bb68c5-3715-4b81-a5f5-864d64a16e34\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/1/1406907627355/112e8f1c-07da-4300-b156-14b98899dc74-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'Security guards tell a truer story than brochures' \u2026 a protester is bundled off stage at Barrick Gold's 2014 AGM in Toronto.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Security guards tell a truer story than brochures\u2019 \u2026 a protester is bundled off stage at Barrick Gold\u2019s 2014 AGM in Toronto. Photograph: David Cooper/Toronto Star/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Tesco answer was the one I was expecting the most from, but the one that delivered the least. Lucas Pinco stood up and said: \u201cI hope you remember me from the Tesco AGM three years ago. I was eight, and as you can see, I have grown since then, and so has the Living Wage campaign. We have had some good conversations but now we need to make some concrete progress.\u201d The room was all his. But CEOs have been in this game long enough not to say anything rash just because there\u2019s a kid in the room. Philip Clarke, the group\u2019s chief executice officer, said half-querulously: \u201cThey get more than the living wage, if you include the benefits in the package, a 10% discount on Tesco\u2019s goods. Tesco\u2019s pays its staff 5-8% more than every single one of its competitors.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis answer was pre-packaged, well prepared and defensive,\u201d Howarth said afterwards. \u201cThe fact is, the Living Wage campaign does take employee benefits into account, but only when they\u2019re genuinely cash convertible. Not when they\u2019re in the form of a pension, or gym membership.\u201d I find it quite distasteful that they\u2019d include the staff discount, so are effectively paying their workers partly in food.</p> <p>This week Lisa Lindsley, from Sum of Us, told me, \u201cThe status quo unfortunately isn\u2019t static. It\u2019s deteriorating. The shareholder season in the northern hemisphere is almost over. So we\u2019re regrouping to see what to do next. Palm oil will continue to be big, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/15/ban-neonicotinoids-another-silent-spring-pesticide-moratorium\">neonics [the pesticide that is thought to kill bees</a>, and has already been banned in the EU]. Lobbying and corporate political spending will still be a big deal, though that isn\u2019t a problem for you guys. CEO pay and low pay will be on the agenda \u2013 what could be really interesting is if people started proposing a policy of a ratio.\u201d</p> <p>The difficulty is that many of the objections are against the whole structure of the business; it\u2019s taken as a given, since you\u2019re masquerading as a shareholder, that you\u2019re as interested in profit as the board is. But most of the time, the problems stem from putting profit before everything else. As Lindsley says, \u201cFrom the point of view of shareholder value, you can\u2019t ask an oil company to completely stop producing oil. You can\u2019t have a shareholder engagement programme that advocates terminating the business.\u201d</p> <p>The arrogant circularity of market fundamentalism is exhausting to approach; and, more than energy, it also takes courage, to approach it on its own turf. The payoff is rarely immediate or concrete \u2013 but there is a payoff, which is that the terms of engagement are laid out: in order to make a profit, x number of workers have to be paid less than they need to live on; in order to stay \u201cin business\u201d, our CEO has to earn 148 times more than the cleaner. Just to get this said out loud is fundamental to the process of asking whether it\u2019s right or not. Plus, you do get a sandwich, and a tiny share portfolio.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2014 to correct the spelling of Lisa Lindsley\u2019s name.<br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Growth in Britain's factories was the slowest in a year in July amid mounting fears that tension between Russia and the west might start to weigh on manufacturing exports. Slowing expansion of manufacturing output, orders and job creation dragged the Markit/CIPS PMI headline index down to 55.4 in July, from 57.2 in June, disappointing expectations that it would remain above 57, and the lowest since July 2013. However, given anything above 50 indicates growth, the survey suggested British manufacturing was in still in decent shape last month. A slight cooling of Britain's economic recovery has been predicted by the Bank of England, which is forecasting modestly lower growth in the third and fourth quarters than the 0.8% rate achieved in the first and second quarters. Fears are rising however that external tensions such as Russia's dispute with the west over Ukraine might exacerbate a slowdown in the UK if it starts to weigh on the economy in Europe \u2013 Britain's biggest trading partner. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"The Bank of England will also not be overly worried by the weaker numbers. Policymakers were expecting growth to slow slightly from the impressive rate seen in the first half of the year. \"The concern is that the slowdown we are seeing is also a symptom of increased economic uncertainty both at home and in key export markets of Europe, in turn fuelled by worries about the Ukraine crisis. If the situation with Russia deteriorates further, we should expect goods exports to come under further pressure.\" New export order growth was the slowest in four months according to the manufacturing PMI, falling to 53.9 in July from 55.6 in June. James Knightley, economist at ING, said the weaker July survey probably reflected concerns about the impact of the situation in Russia, the prospect of a UK interest rate rise, and the recent strength of the pound.",

Policymakers were expecting growth to slow slightly from the impressive rate seen in the first half of the year.</p> <p>\"The concern is that the slowdown we are seeing is also a symptom of increased economic uncertainty both at home and in key export markets of Europe, in turn fuelled by worries about the Ukraine crisis.

In 17 pages of legal disclosures attached to its first-half results, the 81% taxpayer-owned bank revealed the cost of fines or settlements that could come with the wide-ranging inquiry could be \"material\". The bank issued its results last Friday \u2013 a week earlier than expected \u2013 after an improvement in bad debts drove profits to their highest levels since the bailout in 2008. As the Edinburgh-based bank confirmed the rise in profits to \u00a32.6bn, it published information about its performance in the first half of the year along with details about the risks and litigation it could face. But it did not take any additional provisions for the potential cost. RBS outlined potential risks it faces from litigation \u2013 ranging from disclosures it made during a cash call before its 2008 bailout to the sale of mortgage-backed securities before the crisis and the ongoing investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority into the alleged treatment of its small business customers. It also reiterated the potential risks caused by the Scottish independence vote on September 18. Warning of the risks to its credit rating and the backdrop under which it may operate, it added: \"Were Scotland to become independent, it may also affect Scotland's status in the EU. The occurrence of any of the impacts above could significantly impact the group's costs and would have a material adverse effect on the group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\" The bank had previously admitted that it was co-operating with regulators, which have turned their focus on foreign exchange markets following the rigging of Libor, for which RBS was fined \u00a3390m in February 2013. In its latest update, RBS said: \"It is not possible to estimate reliably what effect the outcome of these investigations, any regulatory findings and any related developments may have on the group, including the timing and amount of fines or settlements, which may be material.\" The formal update \u2013 which acknowledges the announcement by the Serious Fraud Office last month that it was investigating the market \u2013 comes after the RBS boss Ross McEwan told the radio station LBC last month that the rigging of currencies could be as big as Libor. \"Unfortunately, I have the feeling that this is a Libor case again,\" McEwan said. When RBS published its results last week, McEwan warned: \"Let me sound a note of caution. We are actively managing down a slate of significant legacy issues. This includes significant conduct and litigation issues that will likely hit our profits going forward.\" The bank's shares slipped just over 1% in early trading to 350p, remaining below the 500p at which the taxpayer breaks even on its stake.",

Among the fallers, United Utilities is down 20p at 870p after Credit Suisse moved from neutral to underperform although it raised its target price from 680p to 730p. The bank said: United Utilities has outperformed the sector by around 16% year-to-date on low interest rates, perceived clarity on returns, and renewed media reports about possible M&amp;A. We now see a risk of cost under-recovery and a downward regulatory asset base adjustment...the market may be overlooking company-specific downside risk approaching draft determinations for the 2015-20 price control review on August 29th, beyond the potential for lower return allowances. Credit Suisse also did damage to outsourcer Capita. The company is down 32p at \u00a311.70 after the bank moved from outperform to neutral. It said: Following Capita's recent first half results, we lower our earnings per share estimates for 2014 and 2015 by around 3%, principally reflecting a lower assumption on the rate of organic growth in 2014. We lower our target price by 2.8% to 1215p (from 1250p), suggesting limited upside near-term potential, and our recommendation to neutral.",

      "bodyText": "British Airways has called for an international treaty to track the whereabouts of surface-to-air missiles around the world in the wake of the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Willie Walsh, the boss of BA's parent company IAG, said the airline had stopped flying over the conflict region in eastern Ukraine in early March, based on publicly available information. However, Walsh said he would like to see the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) put pressure on the United Nations to organise a convention on surface-to-air missiles. \"At a minimum it would help to have a complete inventory of all the weapons, clearly identify which government had responsibility for managing those weapons, and facilitate a system for tracking where all those missiles are \u2013 simple measures that would improve the data and monitoring of those weapons.\" He also called for greater sharing of security information with airlines. \"One thing that clearly can be changed and could make a positive difference to airlines who have to undertake risk reviews would be greater and more transparent sharing of data and information with regard to security issues.\" Walsh said no single development had affected BA's decision to avoid eastern Ukraine, and insisted there was no reason that its own risk assessment would have applied to OneWorld alliance partner Malaysia Airlines. \"The operations, procedures and history of each airline are not the same.\" He pointed out that BA has continued to fly over Iraq but said he respected the decision of the Emirates airline to avoid that airspace. Asked if sharing information with Malaysia Airlines would have made a difference, Walsh said: \"We'd like to think it should. But it wouldn't have changed the fact that the aircraft was shot down by rogue elements. That aircraft was flying in airspace that was open, was clearly identifiable as a civilian aircraft, and should not have been shot down. \" But the IAG boss vehemently dismissed calls to deploy anti-missile technology for his aircraft. The chief executive of British arms company BAE Systems, Ian King, suggested this week that airlines should consider deploying the technology after MH17. Walsh said: \"We've thought about military grade technology and rejected it. The idea that someone who is involved in developing weapons proposes that we use military countermeasures is ridiculous. If Ian King has any concerns, then withdraw from the arms industry and stop developing military equipment.\" Walsh said decisions over airspace routes were based on safety, and that cost was not an issue. Libya and Syria are also no-fly zones for the airline group. An IAG spokesman said airline safety was under constant review by risk assessors. BA has continued to operate a daily flight to Kiev, which is hundreds of miles from the conflict region in the east of the country. Asian airlines, including Korean Air, Asiana, as well as Australia's Qantas, also quit eastern Ukrainian airspace in early March because of safety concerns. Walsh was speaking after IAG revealed that Iberia had swung back into profit three years after a merger with BA. Spain's embattled flag carrier made an operating profit of \u20ac16m (\u00a312.6m) in the first six months of the year, compared with a \u20ac35m loss last year. Iberia's return to profit boosted the bottom line for IAG , which reported a \u20ac230m operating profit, against a \u20ac33m loss for the period. Walsh said IAG was making \"solid progress\" and would continue to cut capacity. He had previously warned that the Spanish airline, which was losing \u20ac1m a day, had to scale back if it was to survive. In 2013 he pushed through a controversial package of 3,300 redundancies and an 11% pay cut in the face of strike action from staff. A further 1,427 jobs are expected to go after IAG and the unions struck a deal last week on another round of redundancies for pilots and ground staff. The upbeat tone from IAG contrasted with Lufthansa, which on Thursday disappointed investors with lower-than-expected profits. Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline, said it was unhappy with its results, as it announced a profit of \u20ac359m for the second quarter, well below expectations. The airline has been forced to reduce ticket prices as it struggles to compete with Gulf carriers over long-haul routes.",
