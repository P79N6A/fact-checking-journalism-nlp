The Frob, the country's bank restructuring fund, was forced to admit that the price it will set for swapping debt into shares at the bailed-out bank would be low \u2013 but denied reports that it would value shares at just 1 euro cent each. Spain's Expansi\u00f3n newspaper had reported that the Frob had set the 1 cent level for shares that, when floated amid an aggressive marketing campaign in 2011, were valued at \u20ac3.75 (\u00a33.23) each. About 350,000 retail investors are thought to have bought at up to that price. A valuation of 1 cent would in effect wipe out their investments. \"The worst is going to happen,\" the newspaper said in an editorial. \"This cold dose of reality, partly a result of the obligations acquired with the European Union when it was rescued, contrast with what has been happening to Bankia's share price.\" The share price fell by more than 22% after a trading suspension was lifted on Thursday morning following the media report, though it later rose again. By late in the day it was trading at \u20ac0.41 \u2013 still more than 40 times the value reported by Expansi\u00f3n. Bankia asked to be rescued last year as it drowned in a sea of toxic real estate left over from a residential construction bubble that burst five years ago, leaving a million new properties unsold. The bank took \u20ac18bn of European aid, which went via the Frob and was added to Spain's national debt. Formed by the merger of seven provincial savings banks, Bankia was devastated \u2013 along with many of its Spanish peers \u2013 by the property market collapse, and a government-enforced clean-up of real estate exposures left it short of capital last year. The complex recapitalisation of Bankia will see parent group BFA, now controlled by the Frob, subscribe to \u20ac10.7bn of Bankia-issued bonds that will then be converted into shares. But the Frob insisted on Thursday that, although Bankia's debts outweighed assets by \u20ac4.2bn in December, the conversion price had not yet been fixed. \"The entity's negative valuation and its end-2012 projected results indicate that the price at which the Frob [will participate in Bankia] via BFA will entail a big reduction in the shares' nominal value,\" it said in a statement.

Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy.\" So said Warren Buffett in a letter to his Berkshire Hathaway shareholders two years ago. The surprise is that he's waited so long to spend some of Berkshire's excess cash. His last big plunge \u2013 the purchase of railway company Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $26.5bn \u2013 was completed in 2010. Heinz is a classic Buffett target. The company makes everyday products, has strong and stable profit margins and is a great American brand that has been around for more than a century. In those respects, it looks like Gillette, one of Buffett's most famous successes: a buy-and-hold investment in which the steady compounding of returns over many years does the hard work. So far, so traditional for Buffett. In other ways, however, this deal is very different. For a start, it could be the start of a relationship between Berkshire and 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity fund that is the partner on the deal. Buffett was falling over himself to heap praise on 3G leading light Jorge Paulo Lemann. 3G's prime creation is AB InBev, the giant brewer that was assembled via a string of bigger and bigger acquisitions. Could bagging Heinz also be a prelude to more deals? \"I would hope that over time we would be adding to this,\" said Buffett. That sounds like more than a hint. Indeed, it could be argued that the price for this acquisition makes more sense if more purchases follow. At $72.50 a share, Berkshire and 3G are paying 20 times Heinz's earnings last year, which is expensive by historical standards in the food industry. Nor have Heinz's virtues been a secret \u2013 a better time to invest was probably several years ago, when activist investor Nelson Peltz started to hammer away to encourage Heinz to raise its game. But, if Heinz is merely step one in a grander plan, the wisdom of paying 20 times earnings is best judged once other pieces of the jigsaw have fallen into place. All of which makes sombre news for fans of public stock markets. Heinz chief executive William Johnson was correct to say that the firm is being bought \"from a position of strength,\" at an all-time high for the share price and that the board had little choice but to offer a recommendation. But what is it that Heinz, which has been a quoted company since 1946, can do in the private arena that it couldn't do in the public? From a purely operational point of view, almost nothing. But, from a financial point of view, Heinz's balance sheet can now be injected with more debt to spice up returns. Note that Buffett, along with $4bn plain-vanilla equity, is also contributing $8bn via preferred shares that will carry a high-interest coupon. It would be hard for Heinz, as a public company obliged to fund itself relatively conservatively, to copy that model. Private equity, this time with Buffett in step, marches on.",

      "body": "<p>A deepening recession in the 17-nation eurozone sent shares lower on Thursday amid evidence that the problems of the single currency's crisis-hit periphery were spreading northwards to affect monetary union's core economies of Germany and France.</p> <p>Despite an easing of financial tensions in the second half of the year, gross domestic product in the members of the monetary union dropped by 0.6% in the final three months of 2012, a heftier decline than the markets had been expecting.</p> <p>An across-the-board fall in output that affected both large and small economies meant that the eurozone economy failed to register an increase in activity in a single quarter of 2012, with a flat first three months of the year followed by three successive drops in output. The combination of weakening activity and high budget deficits prompted a warning from the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor that Spain, France, Italy and Portugal were at risk of a downgrade in 2013.</p> <p>Although Britain also registered a fall in output in the final three of 2013 and is one quarter of contraction away from triple-dip recession, Moritz Kraemer, managing director of European sovereign ratings at S&amp;P said it was not a foregone conclusion that the UK would be stripped of its coveted AAA rating.</p> <p>Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, said seven eurozone countries \u2013 Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Portugal and Finland \u2013 were already officially in recession after suffering two or more successive quarters of falling output.</p> <p>The euro slid on the foreign exchanges amid news that the two biggest economies of monetary union both ended the year in worse shape than feared. Germany contracted by 0.6%, its worst performance since the global recession was at its most intense in early 2009, while France finally admitted yesterday that it would not meet its budget objectives for 2013 after posting a fall of 0.3% in national output in the three months to December 2012.</p> <p>Even steeper falls were recorded in those countries where full-blown austerity programmes are in force. The Italian economy shrank by 0.9% in a continuation of a recession that has been under way since the middle of 2011. Portugal reported a 1.8% contraction, Cyprus a 1.0% fall, while Spain had already announced that GDP dropped by 0.7%. Greece said output in the final three months of 2012 was 6% below that of a year earlier, a slightly slower pace of decline than the 6.7% fall in the year to the third quarter.

      "bodyText": "A deepening recession in the 17-nation eurozone sent shares lower on Thursday amid evidence that the problems of the single currency's crisis-hit periphery were spreading northwards to affect monetary union's core economies of Germany and France. Despite an easing of financial tensions in the second half of the year, gross domestic product in the members of the monetary union dropped by 0.6% in the final three months of 2012, a heftier decline than the markets had been expecting. An across-the-board fall in output that affected both large and small economies meant that the eurozone economy failed to register an increase in activity in a single quarter of 2012, with a flat first three months of the year followed by three successive drops in output. The combination of weakening activity and high budget deficits prompted a warning from the credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor that Spain, France, Italy and Portugal were at risk of a downgrade in 2013. Although Britain also registered a fall in output in the final three of 2013 and is one quarter of contraction away from triple-dip recession, Moritz Kraemer, managing director of European sovereign ratings at S&amp;P said it was not a foregone conclusion that the UK would be stripped of its coveted AAA rating. Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, said seven eurozone countries \u2013 Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Portugal and Finland \u2013 were already officially in recession after suffering two or more successive quarters of falling output. The euro slid on the foreign exchanges amid news that the two biggest economies of monetary union both ended the year in worse shape than feared. Germany contracted by 0.6%, its worst performance since the global recession was at its most intense in early 2009, while France finally admitted yesterday that it would not meet its budget objectives for 2013 after posting a fall of 0.3% in national output in the three months to December 2012. Even steeper falls were recorded in those countries where full-blown austerity programmes are in force. The Italian economy shrank by 0.9% in a continuation of a recession that has been under way since the middle of 2011. Portugal reported a 1.8% contraction, Cyprus a 1.0% fall, while Spain had already announced that GDP dropped by 0.7%. Greece said output in the final three months of 2012 was 6% below that of a year earlier, a slightly slower pace of decline than the 6.7% fall in the year to the third quarter. Unemployment rose to 27% of the workforce. The poor performance of the eurozone's two biggest economies meant the drop in GDP in the fourth quarter was worse than the 0.1% fall in the third quarter. Consensus among analysts polled by Reuters had been for a 0.4% drop. Germany's main stock market index, the DAX, fell by 1% yesterday, with shares in Paris, Milan and Madrid also losing ground. The euro dropped against the dollar and the yen on the foreign exchanges amid speculation that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates in a response to the fall in output.

      "bodyText": "Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), the FTSE 100 mining company that has been stung by a succession of corporate governance crises, has secretly sold a subsidiary to the nephew of one of the group's founders and major shareholders. Arif Shadiev, who was formerly part of ENRC's senior management team and whose uncle Patokh Chodiev is one of the group's controversial founding trio, acquired ENRC's railway maintenance business Zhol Zhondeushi for an undisclosed sum in May 2012. The mining company briefly referred to the deal in its first half results released in August, but chose not to disclose the identity of the buyer. The real nature of the transaction has now emerged and follows an infamous criticism of ENRC being \"more Soviet than City\" after Alexander Machkevitch, Chodiev and Alijan Ibragimov \u2013 the three founders who collectively own about 44% of the shares \u2013 backed a 2011 boardroom coup that ousted two independent directors. The Guardian understands that the railway maintenance business was sold nine months ago to a UK-registered limited liability partnership called Prime Residential County, which was classed as a dormant company when it filed accounts with Companies House in April. In the following month Prime Residential acquired the ENRC subsidiary and, in early June, Shadiev became one of its two members \u2013 a position in effect equivalent to that of a company director. A spokeswoman for ENRC said: \"The sale of Zhol Zhondeushi is in line with our strategy, led by ENRC's chairman Mehmet Dalman, of disposing of the group's unprofitable and non-core assets. \"This company primarily repaired and maintained internal railroads connecting various operations and was a small business within our logistics division. The transaction valuation was provided by an independent audit firm.\" She refused to divulge how much the business was sold for and added that the company had not identified the buyer because the business was small enough to be exempt under stock exchange disclosure rules. ENRC plans to state in its annual report this year that the subsidiary was sold to a related party. However, the sale was significant enough to be cited in ENRC's half year results to the end of June 2012 as a cause for a drop in revenues. The company reported a $2m (\u00a31.3m) decline in the logistics division's earnings and a $15m decrease in its \"third party revenue\". The reduction included the loss of up to two months' sales and profits from Zhol Zhondeushi after it was sold. The incident is not the first time that the company has attracted attention regarding related party transactions. According to an ENRC filing to shareholders last year: \"On 25 April 2012 the company was contacted by the Financial Services Authority in its capacity as the UK Listing Authority. \"The letter stated that the UKLA was conducting a preliminary review of the company's compliance with the listing rules on a group-wide basis and, in particular, LR10 and LR11.\" Listing rule 11 concerns related party transactions, while rule 10 deals with significant transactions. The announcement concerning the FSA's interest in ENRC comes on top of the company's continuing efforts to report its findings to the Serious Fraud Office following internal investigations into allegations relating to its Kazakhstan and Africa businesses. The list of negative publicity has coincided with a terrible run for the company's shares, which more than halved in 2012. However, they have had a stellar start to 2013 on the back of decent production numbers and rumours that the company might be a takeover target. Since becoming chairman a year ago, Dalman has repeatedly pledged to make the company more open. In June he said: \"We need to make our company much more transparent and simplistic.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Combined company will create largest airline carrier in the US and is the third major airline merger in the country since 2008", 
      "body": "<p>American Airlines and US Airways announced an $11bn merger on Thursday that will create the largest airline in the US.</p> <p>Taking the name of American Airlines, the combined company will have a fleet of 1,500 aircraft, $39bn in revenues and would employ 100,000 people. It will be the third major US airline merger since 2008, fuelling fears of higher ticket prices and fewer choices for consumers.</p> <p>AA's parent company AMR is in bankruptcy and courts must approve the deal, which is also likely to attract regulatory scrutiny. But airline experts expect the deal to be approved, capping a wave of big mergers that has swept across the US airline industry.</p> <p>The chief executive role will be filled by the current boss of US Airways, Doug Parker, while AA boss Tom Horton will take a temporary role as non-executive chairman. Parker will also become chairman when Horton steps down.</p> <p>Parker said: \"Today marks an exciting new chapter for American Airlines and US Airways. American Airlines is one of the world's most iconic brands. The combined airline will have the scale, breadth and capabilities to compete more effectively and profitably in the global marketplace. Our combined network will provide a significantly more attractive offering to customers, ensuring that we are always able to take them where they want to travel, when they want to go.\"</p> <p>Horton said the deal signified the launch of a \"new American Airlines\", representing a new lease of life for the latest major US carrier to be threatened by the industry's perilous finances.</p> <p>AA has been in bankruptcy since 2011. Rivals Northwest Airlines, US Airways, Delta Airlines and United Airlines, also filed for Chapter 11 protection, shielding their business from creditors while they restructured. But AA is the last to emerge from Chapter 11 and has been losing ground to its competitors. The airline has lost $12bn since 2001. </p> <p>AA's three main unions are on the creditors' committee, and last year backed the merger after AA brushed off US Airways' original offer. They said Parker's merger plan would save more jobs than AMR's plan to restructure as a standalone business.</p> <p>The US Justice Department has not challenged an airline merger since a merger proposed in 2001 between United and US Airways. Since then United and Continental have merged, as have Delta and Northwest.</p> <p>Parker said that the two airlines have only 12 routes overlapping out of a combined 900. In addition, he said, AA flies to 130 cities that US Airways does not cover, and US Airways flies to 62 cities not served by AA.</p> <p>\"I have been a long proponent of consolidation in the industry,\" Parker said. \"And this is the last major piece needed to rationalise the industry and make it profitable.\"</p> <p>The nonprofit group American Antitrust Institute (AAI) has called for an investigation of the merger, arguing it will substantially reduce competition on a number of routes, create regional strongholds at key airports driving traffic to their hubs and depriving smaller communities of air service.</p> <p>It published a study with the Business Travel Coalition that concluded ticket prices rose 20% on some key Delta routes and 30% on several United-Continental routes after their mergers.</p> <p>Diana Moss, AAI's vice-president, said: \"We have had two big legacy mergers in the past 10 years.

      "bodyText": "American Airlines and US Airways announced an $11bn merger on Thursday that will create the largest airline in the US. Taking the name of American Airlines, the combined company will have a fleet of 1,500 aircraft, $39bn in revenues and would employ 100,000 people. It will be the third major US airline merger since 2008, fuelling fears of higher ticket prices and fewer choices for consumers. AA's parent company AMR is in bankruptcy and courts must approve the deal, which is also likely to attract regulatory scrutiny. But airline experts expect the deal to be approved, capping a wave of big mergers that has swept across the US airline industry. The chief executive role will be filled by the current boss of US Airways, Doug Parker, while AA boss Tom Horton will take a temporary role as non-executive chairman. Parker will also become chairman when Horton steps down. Parker said: \"Today marks an exciting new chapter for American Airlines and US Airways. American Airlines is one of the world's most iconic brands. The combined airline will have the scale, breadth and capabilities to compete more effectively and profitably in the global marketplace. Our combined network will provide a significantly more attractive offering to customers, ensuring that we are always able to take them where they want to travel, when they want to go.\" Horton said the deal signified the launch of a \"new American Airlines\", representing a new lease of life for the latest major US carrier to be threatened by the industry's perilous finances. AA has been in bankruptcy since 2011. Rivals Northwest Airlines, US Airways, Delta Airlines and United Airlines, also filed for Chapter 11 protection, shielding their business from creditors while they restructured. But AA is the last to emerge from Chapter 11 and has been losing ground to its competitors. The airline has lost $12bn since 2001. AA's three main unions are on the creditors' committee, and last year backed the merger after AA brushed off US Airways' original offer. They said Parker's merger plan would save more jobs than AMR's plan to restructure as a standalone business. The US Justice Department has not challenged an airline merger since a merger proposed in 2001 between United and US Airways. Since then United and Continental have merged, as have Delta and Northwest. Parker said that the two airlines have only 12 routes overlapping out of a combined 900. In addition, he said, AA flies to 130 cities that US Airways does not cover, and US Airways flies to 62 cities not served by AA. \"I have been a long proponent of consolidation in the industry,\" Parker said. \"And this is the last major piece needed to rationalise the industry and make it profitable.\" The nonprofit group American Antitrust Institute (AAI) has called for an investigation of the merger, arguing it will substantially reduce competition on a number of routes, create regional strongholds at key airports driving traffic to their hubs and depriving smaller communities of air service. It published a study with the Business Travel Coalition that concluded ticket prices rose 20% on some key Delta routes and 30% on several United-Continental routes after their mergers. Diana Moss, AAI's vice-president, said: \"We have had two big legacy mergers in the past 10 years. It's really time that the Department of Justice looked at how these mergers have affected the market.\" Allison Smith, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division of the department of justice, said she expected regulators to take a \"close look\" at the merger. Smith, now an antitrust lawyer with McDermott Will &amp; Emery, said: \"The Department of Justice has allowed mergers where the networks have been complimentary and there are not too many overlapping routes.\" When United merged with Continental the combined entity had to sell slots at Newark airport to satisfy regulators. Smith said AA and US Airways might have to make similar concessions. The deal has implications in the UK because International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, has a joint venture with AA that allows the airlines to co-operate on transatlantic routes, schedules and fares. Douglas McNeill, investment director at Charles Stanley Securities, said: \"The [transatlantic] agreement will not be affected by the merger but a stronger AA is better for BA. The last thing BA and IAG want is for AA to be destabilised or to go in to long-term decline.\"",

That's a worry,\" said Joseph George, analyst at IIFL Institutional Equities in Mumbai, one of seven with a negative rating on the stock, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. \"That's going to be a problem for Tata.\" JLR had net cash of \u00a3437m at the end of September, but as it ploughs money into a new engine plant in Britain and a factory in China, it will no longer be the cash-generating driver for its struggling owner, Asia's seventh-biggest carmaker by market value. The British carmaker, which produces two notable automotive brands, Jaguar saloon and sports cars and Land Rover SUVs, raised more than \u00a3300m in fresh debt last month and said it would raise funds to fuel expenditure as required.",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has appointed the former head of McKinsey as chairman, ending the eight-year tenure of Sir Simon Roberston. Ian Davis, who held the posts of chairman and global managing director at the management consultancy and also as a non-executive director of BP and Johnson &amp; Johnson, joins the board of the Derby-based manufacturer as a non-executive director in March and takes over from Robertson on 2 May. One of Davis's first tasks at Rolls-Royce could be steering the organisation through the kind of corporate quagmire McKinsey is used to navigating, with the group facing the threat of a corruption inquiry on both sides of the Atlantic. Rolls-Royce has handed an internal investigation into allegations of corruption in Asian markets to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which has yet to decide whether to launch a formal inquiry. The US Department of Justice has also been made aware of the allegations, which include claims from a former Rolls-Royce employee that Tommy Suharto, the son of the former Indonesian president, was paid $20m (\u00a312m) by Rolls-Royce and given a car to persuade the Garuda airline to procure Trent 700 engines. John Rishton, Rolls-Royce chief executive, said Davis's appointment had no link to the corruption allegations. \"We will cooperate fully with the SFO, whoever the chairman is. It's not a case of 'get the right chairman and it will be all right.'\" Rishton added that Davis's experience of global businesses, and of running a business in his own right at McKinsey, was key to the appointment. Davis's appointment was announced alongside full-year results that showed an increase in underlying pre-tax profits by nearly a quarter to \u00a31.4bn, on underlying revenues \u2013 accounting for exchange rate fluctuations \u2013 that rose 8% to \u00a312.2bn. Rolls-Royce's main earner is the manufacturing and servicing of civil aircraft engines such as the Trent 900 that powers the A380 superjumbo. The Rolls-Royce statement gave no update on the SFO situation, reiterating that an outcome of the process \"could include the prosecution of individuals and of the company\". The company recently appointed Lord Gold, who is investing cash-for-access allegations within the Conservative party, to review its anti-corruption procedures. Davis said: \"I am looking forward greatly to joining Rolls-Royce. Sir Simon has led the board with distinction during the past eight years. I am extremely excited by the prospect of building on the firm foundations that have been laid\". Rolls-Royce said on Thursday that its order book had grown by 4% to more than \u00a360bn.",

In December, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-12/mcdonald-s-8-25-man-and-8-75-million-ceo-shows-pay-gap.html\">Bloomberg reported the story of Tyree Johnson</a>, a homeless man who used his two part-time, minimum-wage jobs at McDonalds to pay for a nightly room at a single-occupancy hotel. He's been working for two decades and still can't get the hours necessary to make his work full-time.

In a longtime period of joblessness like the one we're living through, people will take whatever job they can get. </p> <p>But there is an intellectual dishonesty here too, as well as a craven contribution to the country's economic woes.

There is something truly grotesque about corporate leaders who earn millions of dollars \u2013 or even hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2013 arguing over paying their workers literally pennies more. Those workers often have to rely on food stamps or government welfare programs to make up the difference. Meanwhile, company CEOs have barely received a cut in pay for years, and on average they make <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/11/ceo-worker-pay-ratio_n_2259233.html\">231 times as much as the average worker</a>. That's a lot of money, obviously. So the idea that paying $1.50 an hour more in minimum wage would break their companies and force them to save on costs is patently ridiculous.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Warren Buffett, the world's most successful investor, has snapped up the famous food company Heinz in a deal worth $28bn \u2013 adding the ketchup giant to a portfolio that covers everything from insurance and underwear to stakes in Coca Cola and Walmart. Buffett, the second richest man in the US behind his friend Bill Gates, has a long history of investing in famous brands. He said he had been following Heinz's fortunes for some time. \"This is my kind of deal,\" Buffett told financial news channel CNBC. \"I've got a file on Heinz that goes back to 1980.\" The chairman of the Berkshire Hathaway fund was backed by 3G Capital, an investment firm with strong ties to Latin America. 3G's most high-profile acquisition to date was Burger King, the second largest burger chain in which it retains a major stake. The offer represents a 20% premium to Heinz's closing share price on Wednesday. The deal includes taking on $5bn of debt. \"It's our kind of company. It's got a group of fantastic brands, led by ketchup,\" said Buffett. \"The ketchup brand has been around for 135 years or so and I've sampled it many, many times.\" Famous for its \"57 varieties\", Heinz was founded in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania in 1869, and has been headquartered in nearby Pittsburgh for 120 years. Its products include Heinz Baked Beans, Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce and Tater Tots, and it sells its goods in over 200 countries. Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital pledged to maintain Pittsburgh as the company's global headquarters, and to continue support of community initiatives and related investments. Unite, Britain's biggest union, is seeking a meeting with management looking for reassurance about the company's 3,000 British workers. \"The Heinz brand is one of the most respected brands in the global food industry, and this historic transaction provides tremendous value to Heinz shareholders,\" said Heinz chairman, president and CEO William Johnson. Johnson said Heinz's share price had recently hit an all-time high, and that the company was being bought \"from a position of strength. As a private enterprise, Heinz will have an opportunity to drive further growth and advance our commitment to providing consumers across the globe with great tasting, nutritious and wholesome products,\" said Johnson. Henry J Heinz, a devout Methodist of German descent, founded Heinz Noble and company with partner Clarence Noble. Their first product was horseradish. The company went bankrupt in 1875 and Heinz went into business with his brother and cousin. One of their first products was tomato ketchup. The \"57 varieties\" slogan was introduced in 1896 after Heinz was inspired by an advert he saw in New York offering \"21 styles\" of shoe. The company already produced more than 57 varieties even as the ad was being drawn up. Heinz told a number of stories about how the number came about, saying five was his lucky number and seven was his wife's lucky number. Heinz also said seven was selected because of the \"psychological influence of that figure and of its enduring significance to people of all ages\". Buffett said that one of 3G's principal backers, the Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann, had first suggested the deal to him. Lemann, a former tennis star who played at Wimbledon, made a fortune in brewing. The two met when Lemann was on the board of Gillette, the shaving business once owned by Berkshire. Lemann first talked to Buffett about the deal in December during a plane journey. The deal \u2013 big even by Buffett's standards \u2013 may not be his last. At the end of 2012, Berkshire had $47bn of cash on its books. In his letter to shareholders, Buffett said he was looking for other deals. \"We're prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy,\" he wrote. Berkshire is adding between $12bn-$13bn to the deal, leaving it with a sizeable cash pile. The investor refused to be drawn on whether Heinz could be used as a vehicle to snap up other famous food brands. 3G will take the lead in managing Heinz. Lemann, who started his career in investment banking, turned AmBev, a Brazilian brewer, into Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, through a series of audacious mergers and takeovers. Alex Behring, a managing partner at 3G Capital said: \"We have great respect for the Heinz brands, and the strong business that management and its employees operate around the world. We approached Heinz to explore how we might work together to expand the value of this storied brand. \"We fully recognize Heinz's value and heritage, and look forward to working together with Heinz's employees, suppliers and customers as we invest in and support the company's global growth efforts.\" \u2022 This story was amended on 14 February 2013. The original headline said Heinz had been bought for $23bn. This has been changed to $28bn to reflect the debt being taken on by the buyers",

    "webTitle": "American Airlines and US Airways agree $11bn merger", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "American Airlines and US Airways have announced an $11bn merger that will create the largest airline in the US. The boards of AMR Corporation, AA's parent, and US Airways have approved the deal and announced the terms on Thursday morning. Taking the name of American Airlines, the combined company would have a fleet of 1,500 aircraft, $39bn in revenues and would employ 100,000 people. It will be the third major US airline merger since 2008, fuelling fears of higher ticket prices and fewer choices for consumers. The chief executive role will be filled by the current boss of US Airways, Doug Parker, while Horton will take a temporary role as non-executive chairman. Parker will also become chairman when Horton steps down. Parker said: \"Today marks an exciting new chapter for American Airlines and US Airways. American Airlines is one of the world's most iconic brands. The combined airline will have the scale, breadth and capabilities to compete more effectively and profitably in the global marketplace. Our combined network will provide a significantly more attractive offering to customers, ensuring that we are always able to take them where they want to travel, when they want to go.\" Horton said the deal signified the launch of a \"new American Airlines\", representing a new lease of life for the latest major US carrier to be threatened by the industry's perilous finances. AA has been in bankruptcy since 2011, joining Northwest Airlines, US Airways, Delta Airlines and Unite Airlines, which since 9/11 have filed for Chapter 11 protection, shielding businesses from creditors while they restructure. AA's three main unions are on the creditors' committee, and last year backed the merger after AA brushed off US Airways' original offer. They said Parker's merger plan would save more jobs than AMR's plan to restructure as a standalone business. The justice department has not challenged an airline merger since 2000's proposed United-US Airways merger. Since then United and Continental have merged, as have Delta and Northwest. The nonprofit group American Antitrust Institute (AAI) has called for an investigation of the merger, arguing it will substantially reduce competition on a number of routes, create regional strongholds at key airports driving traffic to their hubs and depriving smaller communities of air service. It published a study with the Business Travel Coalition that concluded ticket prices rose 20% on some key Delta routes and 30% on several United-Continental routes after their mergers. Diana Moss, AAI's vice-president, said: \"We have had two big legacy mergers in the past 10 years. It's really time that the department of justice looked at how these mergers have affected the market.\" Allison Smith, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division of the department of justice, said she expected regulators to take a \"close look\" at the merger. Smith, now an antitrust lawyer with McDermott Will &amp; Emery, said: \"The department of justice has allowed mergers where the networks have been complimentary and there are not too many overlapping routes.\" When United merged with Continental the combined entity had to sell slots at Newark airport to satisfy regulators. Smith said AA and US Airways might have to make similar concessions. The deal has implications in the UK because International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, has a joint venture with AA that allows the airlines to co-operate on transatlantic routes, schedules and fares. Douglas McNeill, investment director at Charles Stanley Securities, said: \"The [transatlantic] agreement will not be affected by the merger but a stronger AA is better for BA. The last thing BA and IAG want is for AA to be destabilised or to go in to long-term decline.\"",

High-level officials at the finance ministry denounced the accusations as \"utterly far-fetched\" with some saying that once again they were a case of EU hegemon Germany playing hardball to get Russia to participate in a financial rescue programme for the island - a point that even more bizarrely has resonance among EU diplomats.</p> <p>\"They are utterly far-fetched, a figment of the imagination that simply do not correspond to reality,\" George Sklavos, the finance minister's closest aide, told me this afternoon. \"Cyprus has been evaluated several times since 1998 and has been found to be fully compliant with anti-laundering regulations.\"</p> <p>There is widespread feeling on the island that Brussels has treated Nicosia extremely badly since President Demetris Christofias' outgoing administration was forced to seek rescue from the EU and IMF last June to offset the \u20ac4.5bn damages its banking sector suffered as a result of the private sector writedown of Greek bonds.</p> <p>\"We showed solidarity and consensus then so at the very least we expect to be treated fairly now,\" said Sklavos. Nicosia-based diplomats called the accusations \"a sideshow\".</p> <p>\"The real issue is putting a Troika agreement in place, avoiding a default and EU exit because money has run out and the situation is serious\" said one.</p> <p>\"This may sound conspiratorial but it does feel like this is all about Germany getting Russia, because of its deposits here, to participate in a rescue so it can be passed by the Bundestag.

Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The outcome is stronger than anticipated and it marks the second lowest level of claims since early December.

If anything, the moving average of the past 4 week readings has remained stable at around 350,000 in the past four weeks after running at around 365,000 between December and early January.</p> <p>Such a profile of slowly declining claims is consistent with the ongoing progress in the US labour market.

Thanks for your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow as the G20 begins its meeting with currency wars either on or off the agenda, depending on who you listen to. And here's another sign of life after disaster. Fitch has raised its rating on Iceland from BBB- to BBB. The agency said: The upgrade reflects the impressive progress Iceland continues to make in recovering from the financial crisis of 2008-09. The economy has continued to grow, notwithstanding developments in the eurozone; fiscal consolidation has remained on track and public debt/GDP has started to fall; financial sector restructuring and deleveraging are well-advanced; and the resolution of Icesave in January has removed a material contingent liability for public finances and brought normalisation with external creditors a step closer. Three days before crucial presidential elections in Cyprus, the government is up in arms over German accusations of money-laundering. Helena Smith writes from Nicosia. Greek Cypriot officials are finding it hard to hide their anger - and frustration - with the EU. High-level officials at the finance ministry denounced the accusations as \"utterly far-fetched\" with some saying that once again they were a case of EU hegemon Germany playing hardball to get Russia to participate in a financial rescue programme for the island - a point that even more bizarrely has resonance among EU diplomats. \"They are utterly far-fetched, a figment of the imagination that simply do not correspond to reality,\" George Sklavos, the finance minister's closest aide, told me this afternoon. \"Cyprus has been evaluated several times since 1998 and has been found to be fully compliant with anti-laundering regulations.\" There is widespread feeling on the island that Brussels has treated Nicosia extremely badly since President Demetris Christofias' outgoing administration was forced to seek rescue from the EU and IMF last June to offset the \u20ac4.5bn damages its banking sector suffered as a result of the private sector writedown of Greek bonds. \"We showed solidarity and consensus then so at the very least we expect to be treated fairly now,\" said Sklavos. Nicosia-based diplomats called the accusations \"a sideshow\". \"The real issue is putting a Troika agreement in place, avoiding a default and EU exit because money has run out and the situation is serious\" said one. \"This may sound conspiratorial but it does feel like this is all about Germany getting Russia, because of its deposits here, to participate in a rescue so it can be passed by the Bundestag. On this issue Cyprus has been hard done by as it has complied with regulations.\" In Italy the Monte dei Paschi bank scandal continues to reverberate. Three former executives have been placed under investigation for obstructing regulators in relation to the 2009 derivatives contract at the heart of the probe. They are former chairman Giuseppe Mussari, ex-director general Antonio Vigni and former finance head Gianluca Baldassarri. Baldassarri was arrested earlier in the day, the first to be taken into custody over the alleged fraud at the world's oldest bank. A draft of the G20 statement ahead of this week's meeting in Moscow has apparently been obtained by Bloomberg. Here's the deal: G20 members recognise growth is still weak Members recognise important risks remain G20 committed to avoiding FX rate misalignment Policy uncertainty and deleveraging hurt growth Important risks remain Stronger economic and monetary union needed US and Japan need to resolve fiscal uncertainties Of course, one of the key issues is the so-called currency wars, with countries using policy to influence their exchange rates. A confusing statement from the G7 earlier in the week emphasised the problems around this issue, with many questioning whether Japan's actions were designed to weaken the yen and make the country more competitive. How the G20 tackles this issue is a key part of this weekend's meeting. The number of Americans filing jobless claims fell by more than expected last week, another sign of an improving employment market. US jobless claims dropped 27,000 to 341,000, compared with expectations of around 360,000. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: The outcome is stronger than anticipated and it marks the second lowest level of claims since early December. That said, claims have been very volatile since the beginning of the year, mainly on the back of seasonal adjustment quirks. The pattern of weekly claims in early 2013 reminds of the volatility seen in 2008. As such, we wouldn't read to much out of weekly swings. If anything, the moving average of the past 4 week readings has remained stable at around 350,000 in the past four weeks after running at around 365,000 between December and early January. Such a profile of slowly declining claims is consistent with the ongoing progress in the US labour market. That said, the improvement remains rather slow and we don't anticipate any major decline in the unemployment rate any time soon as the slack in the economy remains very ample. Former UK prime minister Sir John Major has been giving a major speech on a Europe referendum, drawing on his own bitter experience leading a party ripped apart by divisions over Europe. He starts by saying he's neither eurosceptic nor europhile, but goes on to sound distinctly europhile. We sell more to North Rhine Westphalia than to India and more to France and Germany than to the whole of the Commonwealth. He backs Cameron's decision to go to a referendum, saying a vote would put the extremes of opinion on Europe to the sidelines. He says: Unless we re-engage in a national debate, things are just going to get worse. There are lots of people who feel the Europe out there is not the Europe they voted for. I don't think you are going to get rid of that. Major also tells David Cameron to ignore MPs \"with Conservative heads and Ukip hearts\" who cannot be placated with anything less than UK withdrawal. But says he is right to seek renegotiation of powers. Some more key quotes from the speech... The status quo [in the EU] should be changed and can be... with goodwill and tolerance. It is not anti-European to fight for the British national interest but we shouldn't overestimate what can be achieved... If Britain was seen to be in the [EU] driving seat it would revolutionise public opinion. He warns that an EU without Britain could move in the direction of protectionism. He ends by saying the Conservatives should not do a deal with Ukip but should seek to win back the votes of those who are \"using Ukip as an output for their frustration, sometimes as a dustbin vote\". The UK may not get its triple A credit rating downgraded after all, but a host of eurozone countries could see their ratings cut. That is what Moritz Kraemer, managing director of European sovereign ratings at Standard &amp; Poor's has reportedly been saying: The EU formally launched its Robin Hood tax this morning, saying it was a first step to applying the levy across all 27 member states. It is hoped that the financial transactions tax \u2013 which will come in next January \u2013 will raise up to \u20ac35bn annually. It is designed to make banks pay for taxpayer help they received during the crisis. The plan was requested by 11 countries, who represent two-thirds of EU economic output. The bloc's 16 other members, including the UK, refused to back a proposal to introduce the levy across the EU. EU tax commissioner Algirdas Semeta said: It lays the final paving stone on the road towards a common FTT in the EU. Meanwhile, Bloomberg is reporting that Russia, as head of the G20, is seeking specific language against currency market intervention. We'll have more on that as it comes in. The ECB's (remarkably busy) vice president, Vitor Const\u00e2ncio, was warning against ratcheting up the rhetoric about 'currency wars' again this morning. He said: We have to be cautious in my view not to build up the rhetoric about currency wars, because if we build up the rhetoric the danger is there that something worse can happen.

But the economists say this could be the low point for the eurozone economy. (How many times have we heard that?) Here's Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: GDP contraction of 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012 was deeper than expected and brought a dismal end to a very difficult year for the Eurozone. However, the signs are that Eurozone economic activity bottomed out around last October and it is very possible that GDP could stop contracting in the first quarter of 2013 with the overall economic environment significantly helped by the ECB\u2019s Outright Monetary Transactions program. Nevertheless, even modest overall growth for the Eurozone could well remain elusive for some time to come with ongoing contraction in Spain and Italy set to weigh down on the Eurozone\u2019s performance through 2013. France also faces a difficult year. Germany, however, should see a clear return to growth in the first quarter. The eurozone economy has now been contracting for three consecutive quarters, following zero growth in the first quarter of last year. That makes it the first full year in which no quarter produced growth, extending back to 1995. The fourth quarter saw the rate of decline speed up dramatically with output falling by 0.6%, compared with a 0.1% drop in the third quarter. The worst performer was Portugal, with output dropping by a staggering 1.8%. This is apparently the eurozone's poster child for austerity; a country that has followed instructions from its international lenders to the letter, pushing its population to the very edge. The news sent the markets lower, with the UK FTSE 100 currently trading down 0.5%. The French and German share indices have also turned negative, while the euro fell 0.8% to $1.3335. Taking a closer look at the eurozone GDP figures. GDP fell in the fourth quarter of last year at its fastest rate since 2009. The news rather questions the insistence from policymakers that the eurozone has turned a corner. It also does a remarkable job of making Britain's performance look good, as noted by Sky's Ed Conway. Greek unemployment figures tell a similar story, with the jobless rate hitting a new high of 27% in November, from a revised 26.6% in October. That's more than double the eruozone's average rate of 11.7% in November. And for the really bad news... Portugal's economy shrank 1.8% in the fourth quarter, compared with a 0.9% decline in the third. That was a much sharper decline than expected (economists were forecasting a 1% drop) and shows a country struggling under the weight of a biting austerity regime demanded by Portugal's international lenders. Greek GDP was 6% lower in the fourth quarter from the previous year (no quarterly figures given). And Cyprus' economy shrank 1%, compared with a 0.7% decline in the third quarter. Eurozone GDP dropped 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012. That's worse than forecasts for a 0.4% decline and only adds to the gloom this morning, with data showing Germany, France, Netherlands and Italy all contracting. Waiting for the eurozone GDP numbers... Ahead of the eurozone GDP figures, out in 15 minutes, here's Capital Economis on the numbers we have already seen. Jonathan Loynes writes: The country GDP data released so far this morning provides a pretty bleak picture of the state of the eurozone economy at the end of last year. Both the German and French economies suffered bigger than expected quarterly falls in GDP of 0.6% and 0.3% respectively. The Netherlands saw a 0.2% fall and we already knew that the Spanish economy contracted by 0.7%. We don\u2019t have full details at this stage but the German statistics office says that exports and investment dropped \u201cmarkedly\u201d in Q4, while the French figures also showed a drop in exports. This will no doubt fuel fears over the economy\u2019s vulnerability to the strong euro. Of course, survey indicators have pointed to an improvement in the early months of this year. But for now at least they are not strong enough to suggest that the eurozone has pulled out of recession. More protests over in Greece, with anti-austerity demonstrators staging a sit-in at the office of the Greek finance ministry's general secretary, according to local reports. ekathimerini writes: The demonstrators, described as members of SYRIZA's youth organization, were protesting controversial comments made by Giorgos Mergos earlier this week. On Tuesday Mergos suggested that Greece's basic salary was too high. He later said his comments were misinterpreted. \u201cThe only answer to those who are planning to impose new measures designed to impoverish workers and young people is collective and defiant struggles to overturn the government and the memorandums,\u201d the protesters said in a statement. Riot police have been sent to the scene, the reports said. Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras on Wednesday insisted that there are no plans to reduce the minimum wage. But the markets appear to be relatively unfazed by all this news. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research noted this morning that GDP data is, of course, backward-looking and therefore unlikely to influence the market. For the record, he says that unemployment data is the crucial piece of information to keep an eye on. UK FTSE 100: down 0.1%, or 6 points, at 6353 France CAC 40: up 0.2% Germany DAX: up 0.1% Spain IBEX: down 0.3% Italy FTSE MIB: up 0.1% Adding to this morning's gloomy economic news, Italian GDP has also dropped more than expected. Italy's economy shrank by 0.9% in the fourth quarter, showing the eurozone's third biggest economy remains stuck in recession ahead of elections later this month. That compares with forecasts for a 0.6% decline, and third-quarter figures of a 0.2% fall. Italy has now been in recession since mid-2011, its longest slump since 1993. The economy has been battered both by the crisis and austerity measures imposed by prime minister Mario Monti's outgoing government. All three contenders for the upcoming elections are now promising to cut taxes to try and kick start growth. So, for a quick look at the agenda for the rest of today. The G20 finance ministers will be arriving in Moscow for their two-day meeting, which starts tomorrow. Italy Q4 GDP: 9am ECB monthly report: 9am Eurozone Q4 GDP: 10am EU to propose financial transactions tax: 11am US weekly jobless claims: 1.30pm In the debt markets, the UK is selling \u00a34bn of 2018 gilts. As Optymystic points out (in the comments below), that kind of opposition may not be such a bad thing. 'Wall Street and US businesses have attacked a proposed eurozone financial transaction tax'... We'll take that as a compelling argument in favour then. Meanwhile, the European commission is preparing to unveil its so-called Robin Hood tax today. This is the international levy on financial trades to be collected by the eurozone\u2019s biggest economies, which aims to raise an estimated \u20ac30bn-\u20ac35bn a year. But it faces fierce opposition from the US, as well as the UK and Luxembourg, which rejected the tax. The FT's Alex Barker and James Politi report: Wall Street and US businesses have attacked a proposed eurozone financial transaction tax, claiming it overreaches borders, flouts international treaties and \u201cbreaks the bonds that bind our global economy\u201d. This tax blueprint, first reported in the Financial Times, includes tough anti-avoidance measures that would catch some trades executed in New York, London, or Hong Kong \u2013 even when no eurozone entity is buying or selling the product. While the commission is confident the plan is legally sound, the long arm of the levy has raised the hackles of big investment banks, as well as the UK and Luxembourg, which rejected such an EU-wide tax. If France, Germany and nine other states press ahead with a tax based on the commission\u2019s expansive proposal, it is likely to be challenged by some EU governments and big financial groups, according to several diplomats and lawyers. So, all in all, a happy Valentines Day. Overnight, data out of Japan also disappointed. The world's third largest economy shrank 0.1% in the fourth quarter, leaving the country mired in recession and crushing hopes of a modest rebound. The Bank of Japan refrained from further stimulus this morning, which may have been a reaction to all the talk of currency wars this week. Japan has been accused of aiming to drive down the value of the yen (to help boost exports) with its ambitious programme of monetary easing. Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, aimed to answer those critics this morning, saying the central bank's policy is not directly targeting currency moves. The Bank of Japan is conducting monetary policy to achieve stability in Japan's economy. It will continue to do so and I will explain this to the G20 nations. French GDP figures are also in and also worse than expected. Europe's second largest economy contracted by 0.3% in the fourth quarter, compared with forecasts of a 0.2% decline. The economy inched up in the third quarter by 0.1%. France is now flirting with recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. Downward revisions to first and second quarter GDP show the economy contracted 0.1% in each period (rather than initial estimates that it remained stagnant), meaning the country has already suffered one bout of recession over the past year. Good morning and welcome back to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other global economic events. This morning all eyes are on eurozone GDP, which is expected to show the region dropping deeper into recession in the final quarter of 2012. We've already had figures out from Germany, which show the economy contracted more than feared, as exports declined. German GDP dropped 0.6% in the fourth quarter, compared with expectations of a 0.5% decline. That is a big swing from the 0.2% growth the German economy recorded in the third quarter. And it is the deepest contraction since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009. The German statistics office said: Comparatively weak foreign trade was the decisive factor for the decline in the economic performance at the end of the year: in the final quarter 2012 exports of goods declined significantly more than imports of goods. But analysts remained relatively upbeat about the outlook for Europe's largest economy. Carsten Brzeski of ING said: With increased uncertainty stemming from the euro crisis and the global economy cooling in the second half of the year, the German economy has finally lost its invincibility. Looking ahead, however, there is increasing evidence that the economy should pick up speed again very quickly.",

      "bodyText": "The former boss of Lloyds Banking Group on Thursday has defended the sales of payment protection insurance which has cost the bailed bank \u00a35.3bn in provisions. Eric Daniels, whose tenure at the top of Lloyds ended in February 2011, told MPs on the banking standards commission that while he was \"deeply regretful\" for those policies which were mis-sold, he believed the majority of products had been sold correctly. Instead he said there had been a \"difference in understanding\" between the banking industry and the Financial Services Authority which had made changes to the required sales process for the policies that were supposed to cover loan repayments in the event a customer lost their job or became ill. \"We thought we were on the side of the angels,\" said Daniels in reference to compliance with FSA rules. \"We were responsible,\" he said. He insisted that PPI \u2013 which Lord McFall claimed had an 87% commission rate \u2013 had not been highly profitable when assessed alongside the loans with which it had been sold. \"It (the profitability) was lower than most of our products,\" said Daniels. McFall asked Daniels if he had forced out his successor as retailing banking head Peter Ayliffe after 18 months because Ayliffe had raised concerns about PPI. Daniels insisted this was not the case. Ayliffe, now head of Visa, \"left on a voluntarily agreement\". While scripts shown to customers on screen had been adequate until 2008, the FSA had then required proof that customers had been verbally informed about PPI as well, Daniels said. Daniels had \u00a3580,000 of his 2010 bonus clawed back after his successor Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio called a halt to an industry-wide dispute over PPI and took the first of a series of provisions which have now reached \u00a35.3bn \u2014 more than any other bank. Daniels was later denied a \u00a31.2m bonus for integrating Lloyds with HBOS, the rescue takeover he oversaw. Asked by Andrew Tyrie, the conservative MP who chairs the commission, how many policies had been mis-sold, Daniels quipped \"200% judging from the number of claims\". Bogus claims had been paid out in some cases because banks could not handle claims in the timescale set out by regulators. He ran Lloyds retail bank from 2001 before being promoted to chief executive in 2003. He said: \"We believed we were solving a fundamental customer need\".",

      "body": "<p>Beanz now meanz Buffett: the world's third richest man and most successful investor has turned his attention to store-cupboard comfort foods and snapped up the Heinz baked beans and ketchup firm in a deal worth $28bn (\u00a318bn).</p> <p>Warren Buffett, known as the Sage of Omaha and famous for his down-home approach to investment \u2013 buying well-known consumer brands unlikely to be derailed by the digital age \u2013 has linked up with the world's 69th richest man, Jorge Paulo Lemann of Brazil, to pull off the biggest takeover the food business has seen.</p> <p>Heinz, which sells more than 650m bottles of ketchup a year as well as billions of single-serving sachets, will now become part of Buffett's sprawling investment portfolio, which covers everything from insurance to underwear and stakes in Coca Cola, WalMart, Tesco and Kraft.</p> <p>Buffett, 82, who has a fortune estimated at $46bn and is the second richest man in the US behind his friend Bill Gates, said he had been following Heinz's fortunes for 30 years. \"This is my kind of deal,\" the billionaire said. \"I've got a file on Heinz that goes back to 1980.\"</p> <p>Buffett, who has pledged to give most of his fortune to the charitable foundation run by Gates and his wife Melinda, likes to invest in what he calls \"The Inevitables\": businesses and products where he can see at least 10 years ahead and which he knows aren't going to change. Heinz, which also owns a variety of other labels including Classico pasta, HP Sauce, Complan and a range of foods sold under the WeightWatchers name, fits that bill.</p> <p>Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment fund has turned thousands of ordinary investors into millionaires. A $1,000 investment in 1966 would now be worth millions. A share then was worth $22; today they change hands at $150,000 each. Buffett has a folksy image and regularly dispenses homespun wisdom. He has railed against excess executive pay, called for higher taxes on high earnings, and before the crash warned about the dangers of derivatives trading \u2013 calling them \"financial weapons of mass destruction\".</p> <p>Berkshire Hathaway is working with 3G Capital, an investment firm led by Lemann, 72, a former investment banker who with two partners is a big shareholder in the Anheuser-Busch Inbev beer empire, whose brands include Budweiser and Stella Artois. Two years ago 3G bought Burger King for $4bn, and it still owns a major stake.</p> <p>Their $23bn offer for Heinz, which was founded more than 140 years ago, was 20% higher than Heinz's stock market value on Wednesday. Berkshire Hathaway is putting $13bn of cash into the acquisition, but that will make only a small dent in the Buffett cash pile of $47bn. The buyers will also take on $5bn of debt, taking the total deal price to $28bn.</p> <p>\"It's our kind of company.

      "bodyText": "Beanz now meanz Buffett: the world's third richest man and most successful investor has turned his attention to store-cupboard comfort foods and snapped up the Heinz baked beans and ketchup firm in a deal worth $28bn (\u00a318bn). Warren Buffett, known as the Sage of Omaha and famous for his down-home approach to investment \u2013 buying well-known consumer brands unlikely to be derailed by the digital age \u2013 has linked up with the world's 69th richest man, Jorge Paulo Lemann of Brazil, to pull off the biggest takeover the food business has seen. Heinz, which sells more than 650m bottles of ketchup a year as well as billions of single-serving sachets, will now become part of Buffett's sprawling investment portfolio, which covers everything from insurance to underwear and stakes in Coca Cola, WalMart, Tesco and Kraft. Buffett, 82, who has a fortune estimated at $46bn and is the second richest man in the US behind his friend Bill Gates, said he had been following Heinz's fortunes for 30 years. \"This is my kind of deal,\" the billionaire said. \"I've got a file on Heinz that goes back to 1980.\" Buffett, who has pledged to give most of his fortune to the charitable foundation run by Gates and his wife Melinda, likes to invest in what he calls \"The Inevitables\": businesses and products where he can see at least 10 years ahead and which he knows aren't going to change. Heinz, which also owns a variety of other labels including Classico pasta, HP Sauce, Complan and a range of foods sold under the WeightWatchers name, fits that bill. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway investment fund has turned thousands of ordinary investors into millionaires. A $1,000 investment in 1966 would now be worth millions. A share then was worth $22; today they change hands at $150,000 each. Buffett has a folksy image and regularly dispenses homespun wisdom. He has railed against excess executive pay, called for higher taxes on high earnings, and before the crash warned about the dangers of derivatives trading \u2013 calling them \"financial weapons of mass destruction\". Berkshire Hathaway is working with 3G Capital, an investment firm led by Lemann, 72, a former investment banker who with two partners is a big shareholder in the Anheuser-Busch Inbev beer empire, whose brands include Budweiser and Stella Artois. Two years ago 3G bought Burger King for $4bn, and it still owns a major stake. Their $23bn offer for Heinz, which was founded more than 140 years ago, was 20% higher than Heinz's stock market value on Wednesday. Berkshire Hathaway is putting $13bn of cash into the acquisition, but that will make only a small dent in the Buffett cash pile of $47bn. The buyers will also take on $5bn of debt, taking the total deal price to $28bn. \"It's our kind of company. It's got a group of fantastic brands led by ketchup,\" said Buffett. \"The ketchup brand has been around for 135 years or so and I've sampled it many, many times.\" He would not be drawn on whether Heinz could be used as a vehicle to snap up other famous food brands. But the deal \u2013 big even by Buffett's standards \u2013 may not be his last. He told shareholders last year he was looking for deals. \"We're prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy,\" he wrote. Famous for its \"57 varieties\", Heinz was founded in Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania in 1869, and has been based in nearby Pittsburgh for 120 years. It sells its goods in more than 200 countries. Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital pledged to maintain Pittsburgh as the company's global HQ, and to continue supporting community initiatives and related investments. Unite, Britain's biggest union, wants to meet the management to seek reassurance about the company's 3,000 British workers. William Johnson \u2013 chairman, president and chief executive of Heinz \u2013 said Buffett's offer was \"tremendous value\" for shareholders. Henry J Heinz, a devout Methodist of German descent, founded Heinz Noble and company with his partner Clarence Noble. Their first product was horseradish. The company went bankrupt in 1875 and Heinz went back into business with his brother and cousin. One of their first products was tomato ketchup.
