      "bodyText": "And on a final note, tough negotiations between debt-stricken Greece and its creditors over further cost-cutting measures has once again \u2013 alas - got off to a rocky start as the role of the International Monetary Fund comes under scrutiny. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports from Athens Before they had even begun, tensions between Greece and the Washington-based IMF had overshadowed the arrival of the first technical teams in Athens today. This latest round of talks \u2013 the prelude, the government hopes, to completion of a review that will open the way to the much-anticipated debate on debt relief \u2013 hinges to great degree on the government forging ahead with its commitment to reform the country\u2019s pension system. Proposals put forward by the leftist led administration have been quick to elicit howls of protest with demonstrators taking to the streets. The IMF, which has yet to decide whether it wants to be even part of a third bailout programme for Greece (a topic expected to dominate talks when prime minister Alexis Tsipras meets the IMF chief Christine Lagarde on the margins of the Davos gathering later this week) has been especially tough amid mounting speculation \u2013 and leaks \u2013 that the proposals, a particularly sensitive issue given the hardship of austerity and recession, are wholly inadequate. In an unusual fit of pique, the usually mild-mannered finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos appeared to draw a line in the sand this afternoon. The IMF had to make clear whether it stood by the leaks or not, he said. \u201cI want the IMF to clarify whether these are really its own leaks or the imagination of journalists,\u201d he said of the reports that the body had roundly rejected the government\u2019s plan. \u201cI have been given no such notification \u2026 if [the reports are right] I expect it in writing,\u201d he told reporters adding that both sides had agreed that the negotiations would not be conducted through leaks. Racheting up the pressure the Oxford-educated economist insisted that while Athens was open to discussion it also had its own red lines. \u201cIt is very important that pensions are not reduced for a 12th or 13th time for social and economic reasons.\u201d The red-hot issue is like to dominate what may well be a wrenching time ahead. Lenders behind the biggest bailout in global financial history signaled today through the European Commission that mission chiefs would not be returning to Greece before they received clarification on the proposals. It could only be a matter of time before the euro zone crisis erupts again.  And on that note, we\u2019re wrapping up. Back tomorrow for a busy day. After a jittery day, Europe\u2019s main stock markets all closed lower tonight. That extends 2016\u2019s losses, but it\u2019s a whimper rather than a rout as London\u2019s FTSE 100 hits a new three-year low. Here\u2019s the final prices: FTSE 100: down 24 points at 5,780, -0.42% German DAX: down 23 points at 9,522, -0.24% French CAC: down 20 points at 4,190, - 0.5% With no US action to excite them, traders rather ran out of juice by the close of another day dominated by the sliding oil price. Jasper Lawler of CMC Markets explains: The absence of the usual bump in afternoon volumes from US investors left European stock markets a little sleepy on Monday as Americans celebrated Martin Luther King Jr Day. As has become the custom recently; it was the volatile price of oil that set the tone for equity trading. A bounce off the lows set in Asian trading for crude oil helped an encouraging start for European equities but as oil prices slid back, equities fell into the red. It\u2019s not all gloom today. Over in Ireland, there are signs that its economy continues to recover from its debt crisis. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: A sure sign that at least the Irish economic recovery is powering ahead - record numbers of passengers passed through Dublin Airport in 2015. Dubin Airport Authority reveals today that 25 million passengers went through its doors over the last 12 months. That is far higher than its previous peak in 2008 at a time when the Celtic Tiger was still roaring and just before the financial crash. Transatlantic traffic at Dublin Airport is up 47% since 2008 while in the same period traffic to continental Europe has risen by 6.7% To cope with growing passenger numbers, Dublin Airport Authority is midway through hiring about 350 new staff in areas such as security, customer service and asset management. The growth in passenger numbers is expected to continue into 2016, as 11 new scheduled services have already been announced for this year, including new direct transatlantic services to Hartford Connecticut, Los Angeles, Newark and Vancouver. There are also new long-haul charter services to Cancun in Mexico and Montego Bay in Jamaica. Dublin Airport supports or facilitates a total of 97,400 jobs in the Irish economy and contributed \u20ac6.9 billion to the national economy, according to a major study by economic consultants InterVISTAS has found Time for a quick recap: European markets have lurched between gains and losses today as the turmoil in the financial markets enters its third week. The main indices are all in the red after six hours trading, with investors nervous ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Chinese growth figures. And with Wall Street closed for Martin Luther King Day, it could be a cagey afternoon too. The oil price has staged a small rebound, now hovering around the $29 per barrel mark. But it earlier fell to $27.67, on fears that Iran will add to the world\u2019s glut of crude. Ladbrokes, the betting firm, reckons it\u2019s odds-on to keep falling this year, now that sanctions have been lifted on Tehran. Fall below $25 in 2016: 10/11 Fall below $20 in 2016: 3/1 Fall below $10 in 2016: 10/1 China is still centre-stage, after its central bank took new steps to ward off speculators driving down the yuan. Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has suggested that China isn\u2019t as much of a basket case as some fear. But tomorrow\u2019s GDP figures could show if he\u2019s right. I\u2019m off to pack for Davos, but I\u2019ll be back later with the close of the European markets... Nigeria\u2019s stock market is enduring a bad day. The main index has slumped 4% to its lowest level since mid 2012, hit by the falling oil price. That\u2019s 20% off its recent peak - and barely half its value in mid 2014. In a double dose of bad news for the UK economy, Asda is cutting 200 jobs at its headquarters in Leeds. It follows a tough Christmas for the Walmart-owned supermarket chain. A thousand jobs are being cut across Tata Steel\u2019s British operating, including 750 at its Port Talbot plant in Wales. The Indian conglomerate blamed the surge of cheap imported steel into Europe, which exacerbated cheaper steel prices. And the CBI has echoed those concerns: Emma Watkins, CBI Wales Director, says: \u201cThese job losses are a real setback to the Welsh economy and it\u2019s clear that firms in our steel industry face major global challenges to stay competitive. \u201cChinese steel imports look to be having a big impact and it\u2019s important that the European Commission urgently reports back on whether the market has been distorted unfairly by excess market supply. The FT sums it up: Here\u2019s a sobering fact: the total value of the world\u2019s listed companies has dropped to its lowest level since the autumn of 2013: That suggests investors are expecting weaker global growth and smaller dividend payments in the coming years. Volatile morning this. European markets have now crept into positive territory again, with the FTSE 100 up a \u2018mighty\u2019 13 points. And that\u2019s partly because oil has crept back over $29 per barrel mark in the last few minutes. Over in Paris, president Francois Hollande has announced a new \u20ac2bn job creation scheme to tackle France\u2019s unemployment crisis. The plan will set aside \u20ac1bn for job training, and also provide \u20ac2,000 subsidies to a company when they take on a low-paid worker. Hollande told business leaders that the plan wouldn\u2019t require more taxation: \u201cThese two billion euros will be financed without any new taxes of any kind, in other words, they will be financed by savings.\u201d Hollande\u2019s presidency has been dogged by economic woes, with unemployment climbing steadily to record highs. Today\u2019s speech shows a ratcheting up of the rhetoric, as Associated Press explains: French President Francois Hollande has declared what he called \u201ca state of economic emergency\u201d and says it\u2019s time to redefine France\u2019s economic and social model. Hollande laid out a series of proposed economic measures Monday in an annual speech to business leaders to boost long-stagnant French growth and reduce chronic unemployment. Today\u2019s floundering rally means that that Stoxx 600 index of major European companies has shed 15% of its value since the start of December. Does this validate the famous \u201cSell Everything\u201d call issued by Royal Bank of Scotland analysts this month? Not according to Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. He reckons investors should hold their nerve: \u201cWe should remember that volatility is the price you pay for the long-term outperformance of equities over other asset classes. \u201cIt is also worth remembering that staying fully invested through market cycles makes sense because missing even a handful of the best days in the market can seriously compromise your long-term returns. The best days in the market invariably follow close behind the worst ones \u2013 time in the market matters more than timing the market.\u201d We\u2019ll know in a few months who is right... Reuters is reporting that China\u2019s top stock market regulator has offered to quit, after seeing hundreds of billions of dollars wiped off shares in recent months. It\u2019s not clear if Xiao Gang\u2019s resignation has been accepted; but he may pay the price for the turbulence at the start of this year. Over to Reuters.... Xiao Gang, 57, chairman of the China Securities RegulatoryCommission (CSRC), tendered his resignation last week after his brainchild, a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d mechanism to limit stock market losses, was blamed for exacerbating a sharp selloff and was deactivated on January 7, just three days after its introduction, a source with ties to the leadership and a financial industry source told Reuters. The circuit breaker imposed a \u2018time out\u2019 if the market fell by 5%, and halted trading if it then dropped by another 2%. Regular readers will remember how the circuit breaker forced trading to be suspended on its first day, on 4th January, and again on the 7th. Those City analysts were right to be cautious..... Europe\u2019s main stock markets are all in the red. The brief rally has unwound itself, and here\u2019s the situation: FTSE 100: -13 points at 5794 (-0.2%) German DAX: -40 points at 9,484 (-0.6%) French CAC: -35 points at 4,174 (-0.8%) Hardly a major selloff, but it\u2019s disappointing that the early flickers of optimism were blotted out so quickly. IG\u2019s Chris Beauchamp says: In mid-morning trading, the FTSE 100\u2019s early gains have evaporated as quickly as yesterday\u2019s snowfall. The ructions in the global markets have just driven India\u2019s main index down to a 20-month low: Stocks are being pulled down by today\u2019s falling oil price; energy exploration firm Cairn Energy has tumbled by 7%. Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz reckons that fears over China are overblown. Speaking in Davos, Stiglitz told Bloomberg that: \u201cThere\u2019s always been a gap between what\u2019s happening in the real economy and financial markets.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in China is a slowdown by all accounts....but it\u2019s not a cataclysmic slowdown.\u201d More here: Davos Veterans Say Stop Worrying About China\u2019s Market Meltdown Over in Davos, the World Economic Forum is making the final preparations ahead of its Annual Meeting, which begins on Tuesday night. One of the main items on the agenda is the Fourth Industrial Revolution - the rise of more intelligent machines and new technologies such as self-driving cars, 3D printing and the blockchain that underpins Bitcoin. And a new report from WEF has just warned that seven million jobs could lost in advanced economies over the next five years, particularly in heathcare, energy and financial services. My colleague Jill Treanor has checked out the report. Here\u2019s her story: Europe\u2019s early rally is already petering out, with the FTSE 100 now up only 4 points at 5808. I guess there\u2019s not much to inspire investors this morning. And many may be keeping to the sidelines today, as the latest Chinese GDP growth figures are released overnight. China\u2019s central bank took fresh measures over the weekend to protect its currency against speculators. The People\u2019s Bank of China announced that foreign banks who engage in offshore yuan trading must place some of their yuan reserves with the central bank. The move may deter the banks from aggressively driving down the yuan. Or as PBoC put it, imposing the reserve requirement would \u201cinhibit pro-cyclical behaviour\u201d. In the short term, the move appeared to work, as the yuan strengthened a little against the US dollar. But Kit Juckes, currency strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, fears that it shows Beijing is making up policy on the hoof. The danger is that this just leaves markets to focus attention elsewhere. City analysts are cautioning that today\u2019s rally in Europe may be a temporary respite. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says that \u201cconcerns are still growing over global economic strength in the face of a collapsing commodities space\u201d. And Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct reckons a \u201ctemporary halt\u201d has been called in the equity rout, particularly as the US market will be closed today. Oil remains front of mind for many and the prospect of Iranian supplies coming back onto the global market certainly rattled investors in the Middle East yesterday, but elsewhere the reaction has been rather more muted. We\u2019ve seen a calm session in Asia, although with crude prices now retreating once again, it would seem ambitious to think that we can read too much into the current air of calm. With many markets on Wall Street closed for Martin Luther King Day, this may also help calm nerves - the week may not open with quite the catastrophic start some had eyed. European stock markets are actually rising this morning, which might reassure nerves. The FTSE 100 index has gained 35 points, of 0.6%, to 5839. That claws back some of Friday\u2019s rout, where the blue-chip index lost around 110 points. Shares are also picking up in France and Germany, where losses in 2016 have been even steeper than in London. It\u2019s a fairly muted bounceback -- markets are only up around 1%. But after two weeks of mayhem, any recovery will be welcome in the City (assuming it lasts). Investors will be watching the oil market closely this week, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: The continued weakness in commodity prices, particularly in the oil and gas sector continues to spook world markets and now that Iran has been given the green light to come in from the cold, it is likely to be difficult to see where the next rebound in oil prices is likely to come from, raising concerns about further bankruptcy losses across the sector, if as predicted prices fall further towards $20 a barrel. It\u2019s been a grim few months for commodities, with oil at a 12-year low and many metals hitting their lowest levels since the financial crisis. And Bloomberg\u2019s Caroline Hyde flags up that City speculators are betting that the slump will continue: Oil traders have marked Iran\u2019s return to the markets by sending the cost of crude oil down to its lowest level in over 12 years. The West\u2019s decision to lift sanctions on Tehran helped to push Brent crude down to $27.67 per barrel today. Traders are anticipating a new surge of supplies hitting the market, intensifying worries about supply gluts. We\u2019ve known for a while that sanctions were likely to be removed, so it shouldn\u2019t have shocked many traders. Japan wasn\u2019t the only Asia-Pacific market to suffer the Monday blues. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index fell by 1.1%, hitting a three-year low, as fears over China\u2019s economy hit confidence again. Australia\u2019s market also weakened, reflecting concerns that demand for its commodities will be weak in 2016. It\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 20 index lost another 0.7% - putting it close to a bear market too. China\u2019s market, though, defied the general gloom to finish 0.4% higher. Japan\u2019s stock market is on the brink of a new bear market, after being hit by the global market turmoil. After another day of heavy selling, the Nikkei index lost another 191 points, or 1.1%, today to close at 16,955. That\u2019s a four-month low, and around 19% off its recent high set last August. Once it loses 20%, it will be officially in \u2018bear market\u2019 territory. Japanese exporters have been hit by the strength of the yen, which has rallied this year as nervous investors sought protection from riskier assets. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the worst start to a New Year ever, world markets are facing another week of turbulence. Friday night\u2019s Wall Street rumble, which wiped another 390 points off the Dow Jones industrial average, has sent nerves on edge across the globe. Fears continue to build over China, with its slowing economy threatening to puncture the huge credit bubble that has build up in recent years. And oil could continue its crazy ride downwards. Iran is preparing to start pumping more crude supplies into a well-stocked market, after sanctions were lifted last night. Middle Eastern markets have already been rattled, with Saudi Arabia\u2019s index shedding over 5% yesterday to a near five-year low. Kuwait lost more than 3%, while Qatar tumbled by 7%. The European and US stock markets have already shed 8% this year, a shocking loss of wealth in just two weeks. It may not be the great market crash that more pessimistic analysts have been calling for years. But the scale of the losses this year suggest that investors have turned much more negative about the prospects for the global economy as a whole. Gareth Isaac, fund manager at Schroders, says China is a serious worry: Regarding China, we don\u2019t see the cataclysmic 2008-style \u2018credit crunch\u2019 forming that some market participants do, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we are not concerned. There are significant risks. China now accounts for approximately 17% of global GDP; up from 10% in 2005. Any material slowdown in the second largest economy in the world would have significant ramifications for the rest of the globe. China is attempting to make the transition from a manufacturing-led economy to a service-led economy \u2013 a transition that took the UK generations \u2013 in a decade or so. That process is not going to be without difficulty, and the Chinese authorities are learning as they go. Mistakes will happen. And that\u2019s why traders are going to be cautious today, this week, and through much of 2016.....",

      "bodyText": "The government faced renewed calls to tackle the crisis engulfing the British steel industry after the UK\u2019s largest steelmaker announced more than 1,000 job cuts. Tata Steel announced plans to axe 1,050 jobs, including 750 at the UK\u2019s largest plant in Port Talbot, south Wales, as it warned that cheap imports from China were endangering the European steel industry. As steel manufacturers and trade unions urged ministers to step in, David Cameron said the government would continue to work with British-based steelmakers, who have now shed a combined 5,000 jobs since last summer. Tata blamed falling global steel prices and a flood of cheap imports for the cuts and said the UK and the EUneeded to act more urgently to deal with the crisis in the industry. Karl Koehler, chief executive of Tata Steel\u2019s European business, said: \u201cWe need the European commission to accelerate its response to unfairly traded imports and increase the robustness of its actions. Not doing so threatens the future of the entire European steel industry. \u201cThe government must take urgent action to increase the competitiveness of the UK for its vital steel sector. This includes lowering business rates and supporting energy efficiency and anti-dumping cases so we can compete fairly.\u201d The price of a tonne of European domestic hot rolled coil \u2013 a type of steel \u2013 has more than halved from \u20ac642 (\u00a3490) per tonne in 2011 to \u20ac320. In the same period, China\u2019s annual steel exports to the EU have surged from 4.6m tonnes to 7.7m tonnes, amid allegations that Chinese companies are \u201cdumping\u201d steel in the EU that they can\u2019t sell domestically. The prime minister said the government was acting to cut energy prices for steel companies, give more government contracts to UK firms and engage with the European Union on cheap Chinese steel exports. \u201cBut we\u2019ll continue to work with them and I want to have a strong British steel industry at the heart of our important manufacturing base,\u201d he said. Unions accused the government of failing to match its rhetoric with action. Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community trade union, said ministers were more interested in strengthening business links with China than addressing the impact of cheap Chinese steel on the UK\u2019s industry. He said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is no reflection of the skills and commitment of the Tata Steel workforce, which has been breaking production records over the past year. \u201cEven now, promised compensation for energy intensive industries is yet to be received. The dumping of cheap Chinese steel is one of the biggest causes of this crisis, yet the UK government remains a cheerleader for China. You can\u2019t wring your hands over steel job losses and then shake hands with the Chinese government over cosy trade deals.\u201d A parliamentary committee criticised the government last month for reacting too slowly to the crisis. The shadow businesss minister, Angela Eagle, accused the government of \u201cwarm words but very little concrete action\u201d. Anna Soubry, the business minister, said the government would work with the Welsh assembly to support workers and find them new jobs. She added: \u201cThe government has taken clear action to help the industry, through cutting energy costs, taking action on imports, government procurement and EU emissions regulations and meeting key steel industry asks.\u201d Gareth Stace, director of the industry lobby group UK Steel, said: \u201cThis [Port Talbot] is a site of critical importance to our national industrial infrastructure. The whole industry needs to be reassured that ministers and officials \u2013 in Westminster and in Cardiff \u2013 are doing everything possible to support the future of steel production. The government needs to be creative, co-operative and fleet of foot to make sure every possible option for support is considered.\u201d In October last year, Tata announced almost 1,200 cuts, mainly in Scotland and Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, and 720, mainly in Rotherham, Yorkshire, in July. Other job cuts in the industry include 1,700 caused by the closure of the SSI plant at Redcar on Teesside. The latest cuts announcement by Tata, an Indian conglomerate that bought the remnants of British Steel in 2006, includes job losses at the company\u2019s plants in Llanwern and Trostre in Wales, as well as Corby in Northamptonshire and Hartlepool in county Durham. Unite, the UK\u2019s largest trade union, said Britain\u2019s steel industry could be wiped out despite the government\u2019s claim that it was doing all it could to support the sector. Harish Patel, the union\u2019s national officer, said: \u201cThe knock-on effects of these latest job losses will be felt throughout the supply chain and the wider manufacturing community across the UK, torpedoing George Osborne\u2019s promise to rebalance the economy. When will the penny drop with government ministers that a strategically important part of the UK economy faces wipeout because of their continued failure to take decisive and swift action?\u201d Many of the job cuts have been concentrated in towns that rely on jobs at steelworks to support local businesses. Tata employs more than 4,000 people at its Port Talbot plant and about 3,000 more contractors and agency staff work there, Community said.

She added: \u201cThe government has taken clear action to help the industry, through cutting energy costs, taking action on imports, government procurement and EU emissions regulations and meeting key steel industry asks.\u201d</p> <p>Gareth Stace, director of the industry lobby group UK Steel, said: \u201cThis [Port Talbot] is a site of critical importance to our national industrial infrastructure. The whole industry needs to be reassured that ministers and officials \u2013 in Westminster and in Cardiff \u2013 are doing everything possible to support the future of steel production. The government needs to be creative, co-operative and fleet of foot to make sure every possible option for support is considered.\u201d</p> <p>In October last year, Tata announced <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/tata-steel-expected-to-announce-1200-job-losses-in-uk\">almost 1,200 cuts, mainly in Scotland and Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/16/tata-cuts-720-jobs-strong-pound-high-energy-costs\">720, mainly in Rotherham, Yorkshire</a>, in July.

      "bodyText": "Hands up, who wants to open a trade war with China to protect the UK\u2019s and the European Union\u2019s steelmakers? The sad truth about the crisis in the UK steel industry, where Tata Steel yesterday cut 1,050 jobs, including 750 at its Port Talbot plant, may be this: in the current climate, nothing less than stiff tariffs on imported Chinese steel will meaningfully improve the lot of UK and EU producers. The figures from UK Steel, the industry lobby group, are striking. Chinese steelmakers are believed to be losing about $34 (\u00a323) a tonne on the crude steel they produce. China\u2019s top 101 steel producers, most of them state-owned, lost about $11bn during the first 10 months of 2015, or roughly twice what they made in profits the previous year. China\u2019s exports of steel have risen from 7.2m tonnes in 2003 to 107m tonnes in 2015. This is globalisation in action, accelerated by a slowdown in the Chinese economy that has encouraged its domestic steelmakers to turn to export markets with greater vigour. A UK steel industry that employed 30,000 at the start of last year will soon be smaller by a fifth. The UK government was criticised, rightly, last year by a parliamentary committee for being slow to react to the looming crisis and for doing less than other EU states. But note what the business committee also said about the resulting government measures, such as the bringing-forward of compensation for energy-intensive industries: \u201cEven when fully implemented, these measures should not be seen as the answer to the long term difficulties faced by the UK industry as a result of the expansion of production and dumping of steel in the UK market by China.\u201d Quite. The UK government can alleviate some short-term financial pain for the likes of Tata, but it cannot wish away China\u2019s over-capacity in steel. Does the EU have the political will to slap tariffs on Chinese steel to discourage dumping? Optimists in the industry point out that a 24% import duty on wire rod, a small part of the industry, has been in place sine 2009. But they also grumble, understandably, that the European Commission takes 12 months to conduct its anti-dumping investigations whereas equivalent authorities in the US do the job in about three weeks. That difference in speed, one suspects, reflects the vastly different appetites for imposing tariffs. In short, the Europeans don\u2019t have the stomach. Indeed, ask yourself whether George Osborne, having invited the Chinese to build his \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d and a couple of nuclear power stations in the UK, would really be prepared to support a tit-for-tat tariff war with Beijing. Maybe the European Commission, when its latest investigation finally reaches a conclusion, will surprise us by recommending \u201cquick and effective anti-dumping action\u201d, as lobby group UK Steel hopes. But it\u2019s not the way to bet. Amec\u2019s Brikho learns his limits It was, said Samir Brikho, Amec\u2019s chief executive, a \u201ctransformational deal\u201d. Unfortunately for him, the \u00a31.9bn purchase of Foster Wheeler, announced two years ago, has ended up transforming his reputation as a boss who was one step ahead of the company\u2019s markets. The first seven years of Brikho\u2019s nine-year tenure were a shining success. He shed Amec\u2019s dull construction business, which delivered wafer-thin profit margins, and got deeper into businesses servicing the oil and gas industries. The timing was excellent. Amec caught the surge in the oil price and the extra spending by oil explorers and producers. Profit margins improved in leaps and Amec joined the FTSE 100 club. \u201cKnow your limits \u2013 but never stop trying to exceed them,\u201d wrote Brikho in the 2011 annual report in typically bold fashion. By 2015, he had already said, Amec would achieve earnings of 100p a share, more than double the 2008 tally. Foster Wheeler was meant to cement that \u201cVision 2015\u201d. Instead, Amec\u2019s shares have fallen by two-thirds since the unveiling and the target of 100p of earnings has been missed by a mile. Defenders will say the logic behind the deal remains sound because it took Amec towards the refining and storage end of the oil industry, where pricing pressures are less intense. But that is only a plea in mitigation. In retrospect, the timing and price were wrong. Amec, after paying half in cash, ended up with \u00a31bn of debt in a downturn, which is why shareholders\u2019 dividends have halved. Brikho is now \u201cstepping down\u201d with the share price roughly where it was when he stepped up in 2006. As he never said, but should have done: in this business, know your limits are set by the oil price and don\u2019t bet the balance sheet. Yet another banking flotation? Yes, it\u2019s CYGB, or the Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group, which is being spun off by National Australia Bank. The Aussies seem anxious to wave goodbye. At the bottom end of the price range, CYGB is valued at just 0.56 times book value. That\u2019s either admirably conservative or an acknowledgement that returns in UK banking look dull as far the eye can see. It\u2019s probably the latter, judging by the recent slips in the share prices of bigger beasts like Lloyds and RBS.",

      "bodyText": "The prospect of ultra-low interest rates persisting for years to come has been conjured up by a leading Bank of England policymaker after a further fall in oil prices and shares in London sinking to their lowest level since late 2012. Gertjan Vlieghe, one of the nine members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee, the body that sets the official cost of borrowing, said debt, demographics and distribution of income could all depress interest rates. In his first speech since becoming a member of the MPC, Vlieghe said policymakers should not assume \u201cthe future will look like the past\u201d and must \u201cbe prepared for the possibility that real interest rates will remain well below their historical average for a very long time\u201d. The closure of Wall Street for the Martin Luther King public holiday meant a quieter day on financial markets before growth news from China overnight. London\u2019s FTSE 100 Index fell 24 points to 5,779.9. Market expectations that the official lifting of sanctions against Iran will lead to an increase in the supply of oil triggered a fresh decline in the cost of crude. At one stage in early trading in London, Brent crude fell to $27.67 a barrel before recovering to $28.80 by the close. \u201cIran\u2019s return to the oil market has been on the agenda for some time and therefore does not really come as any great surprise,\u201d a Commerzbank senior analyst, Carsten Fritsch, said. \u201cNonetheless, prices were bound to react negatively in the short term in view of the negative market sentiment.\u201d The oil price has fallen by more than $85 dollars a barrel from its recent peak of $115 a barrel in August 2014, leading to lower inflation and less pressure on central banks to raise interest rates. Vlieghe said there were also longer-term factors helping to keep borrowing costs low. Higher levels of debt would make interest rates less effective in raising spending levels; a longer-living population would be saving more for future retirement; and a more unequal distribution of income might amplify the effects of rising debt. The MPC member said it was not hard to imagine a world in which all three Ds interacted. \u201cA high debt economy faces headwinds and needs lower interest rates. A high debt economy with adverse demographic trends needs even lower interest rates. And a high debt economy with adverse demographic trends and higher inequality ... well, you get the picture.\u201d In March, the MPC will have held interest rates unchanged at 0.5% for seven years, and with only one member, Ian McCafferty, voting for an increase at its meeting in January, the City now believes it will be late 2016 or early 2017 before borrowing costs rise. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, will give his views on the state of the economy in a speech on Tuesday but Vlieghe made it clear he was in no hurry to vote for an increase. \u201cIf I were confident that, over the next few years, policy rates would have to rise significantly to match historical averages of real interest rates, I would be looking for the first possible opportunity to raise rates, to avoid having to raise them very sharply in the next few years. \u201cBut I am not confident of that at all. Rather, I think it is plausible that the appropriate real interest rate for the economy might be very low for years to come. So policy rates, when they rise, may not need to rise by much over the coming years. These medium-term considerations make me relatively more patient before raising rates.\u201d The MPC has been expecting the steady decline in the UK\u2019s jobless total to start pushing up the level of pay, but Vlieghe said he saw little evidence that this was happening. \u201cIn order to be confident enough of the medium-term inflation outlook to raise the bank rate, I would like to see evidence that growth is not slowing further, and that a broad range of indicators related to inflation are generally on an upward trajectory from their current low levels,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not see convincing evidence yet of upward momentum in pay pressures. With growth still slowing, and inflation pressures either easing outright or disappointing relative to forecasts, I do not believe the conditions are in place to warrant a rise in the bank rate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Banking Standards Board, established to bolster the reputation of the industry, has yet to issue any standards nine months after formally being created. The body, chaired by Dame Colette Bowe, was the industry\u2019s response to the public backlash against bankers unleashed by the \u00a3290m fine imposed on Barclays for Libor rigging in 2012. It was established on the recommendation of Sir Richard Lambert, a former editor of the Financial Times and ex-head of the CBI, the employers\u2019 body. Lambert was commissioned by major banks to devise ways to help restore the sector\u2019s fortunes. It formally began its work in April. The body does not have any statutory powers. However, its role in assessing banks was one of the reasons cited in the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s decision to abandon a review into banking culture. The revelation at the end of last year that the City regulator\u2019s review had been dropped prompted a range of accusations about Treasury involvement - repeatedly denied - in encouraging a softer approach towards the financial sector. In its first nine months the Banking Standards Board has measured banks against their own internal standards and sent them the first of what are expected to be annual reports on their compliance with their own internal goals. Bowe said last month that she expected these reports \u2013 sent to 10 major banks \u2013 to be published in some form although she was not specific about what form this would take. Although there are not any industry-wide standards the board said it was working on ideas which could be adopted across the sector. \u201cWe are currently exploring with firms, professional bodies and other organisations, areas of banking where new, cross-firm standards would be beneficial for customers, the sector and the economy,\u201d the board said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that any standards issued are implementable, properly targeted, and don\u2019t duplicate what is already out there. They need to be clearly differentiated from minimum regulatory requirements. And, in line with best practice in standard setting, there needs to be proper consultation for them to be effective.\u201d The accountancy body, the Financial Reporting Council, has also embarked on a review of culture, that goes beyond the banking sector. It said: \u201cThe FRC recognises the challenges that boards face when addressing the culture of their companies and in 2015 brought together a \u2018culture coalition\u2019 to highlight effective approaches and share good practice. \u201cThe FRC is looking to understand the role of boards in shaping and embedding a desired culture, and will publish its findings in summer 2016.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "BT will recruit 1,000 staff in the UK after customers complained that that they did not like speaking to staff in Indian call centres. The group said as a result of this feedback, it would ensure that at least 80% of calls were answered from the UK by the end of the year, up from more than 50% currently. The telecoms giant pledged to spend \u00a380m to improve its customer service, ranked by the regulator, Ofcom, as among the worst in the industry. The changes will begin in Swansea, with a further 100 staff to be hired in BT\u2019s South Wales centre. The remaining jobs will be spread around BT\u2019s 20 call centres throughout the UK. The attempt to placate frustrated customers resulted in BT creating 1,000 jobs at UK call centres last year; it plans double that number by April 2017. The recruitment drive follows reports from customers that they preferred speaking to people in UK call centres rather than Indian staff based in Bangalore and Delhi. BT said the new jobs would be \u201cfrontline roles\u201d in customer care. Staff in its Indian call centres, which BT started using in 2003, are expected to be moved into positions that do not involve talking to customers. The plan is part of an effort to improve BT\u2019s standing in the tables of customer complaints, compiled by Ofcom. The regulator\u2019s annual report on customer service, released on Friday, shows that Sky and Virgin Media beat BT in terms of satisfaction with how complaints were handled. But while BT performed badly overall, data on how quickly telecoms firms resolved complaints undermine reports that customers find it hard to communicate with Indian call centre staff. BT beat major rivals Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin Media for resolving broadband complaints within an hour and was ranked second for landline problems. Libby Barr, BT managing director of customer care, said the hiring drive was a \u201cfantastic boost for the UK economy and many regions where we are already a significant employer\u201d. As well as beefing up its customer service team, BT is also changing the way they work. It said staff had recently agreed to more flexible working hours, to make sure calls could be answered from the UK at the weekend and in the evenings. \u201cThis demonstrates the commitment from everyone at BT to work together to improve customer service and to make things easy for our customers,\u201d said Barr. BT said staff would receive an extra 100 hours of training to improve their response to complaints. Technology will also play a part in BT\u2019s efforts to improve relations with customers. Systems used by call centre staff will be updated, while customers can use the BT mobile phone app to check their bill or track an engineer ahead of an appointment.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou is poised to block pay deals for directors at easyHotel, in the latest battle of his war on high wages. The billionaire investor has objected to the rewards on offer to directors at several companies in which he owns a major stake, including easyJet and Fastjet, the low-cost African airline. His latest intervention came before easyHotel was due to announce its pay arrangements to investors at the group\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday. In a statement to shareholders, Haji-Ioannou said easyGroup wanted to \u201cregister its concern over the proposed cost plan associated with the execution of the company\u2019s strategy\u201d. He pointed to predictions by the firm\u2019s house broker, Investec, that while revenue would have trebled between 2013 and 2017, costs would have increased fourfold. \u201cNet profit will have been nearly halved as a direct consequence,\u201d said easyGroup, which plans to vote against the firm\u2019s pay report and abstain on every other issue. EasyGroup added that it was \u201csupportive of the easyHotel board\u201d but called for the company to adopt a \u201clean overheads and low unit cost philosophy\u201d. As Haji-Ioannou owns 49% of the company, he has a strong chance of defeating the resolution to approve its remuneration report, particularly if small shareholders do not vote. Polar Capital, the second largest shareholder with 13%, did not return requests for its voting intentions. Sources close to Haji-Ioannou said that while costs had risen across the board, in line with the firm\u2019s plans to expand in the UK and Europe, he was chiefly concerned about pay. Deals for the company\u2019s new management team include a host of bonuses and incentive plans that could see their pay packets skyrocket. The chief executive, Guy Parsons, recruited from Travelodge last year, picked up \u00a333,465 for less than two months\u2019 work in 2015, equivalent to nearly \u00a3250,000 over the year. That\u2019s more than twice as much as the \u00a3115,625 that his predecessor, Simon Champion, took home in 2014. But the annual report revealed Champion was handed termination payments worth \u00a3160,000 after being ousted in favour of Parsons. This included an unexplained additional payment on top of his contractual entitlement, worth \u00a350,100. The new finance chief, Marc Vieilledent, received nearly \u00a3100,000 for three months and 25 days\u2019 work, equating to about \u00a3170,000 over the course of a year. He was also handed a \u00a335,000 signing-on fee. Overall, easyHotel\u2019s directors cost the company \u00a3650,000 in 2015, compared with \u00a3195,000 the previous year. They will be able to earn up to double their basic salary in 2016 thanks to a cash bonus scheme linked to profitability. The company is also due to announce details of a share-based incentive plan that could see directors paid a further 200% of salary. This is part of an arrangement agreed with Vieilledent and Parsons when they joined the company last year. EasyHotel\u2019s annual report says this pay structure allows it to \u201cattract, retain and motivate Executives of the highest calibre but without paying more than is necessary for this purpose\u201d. The rewards available to easyHotel directors are in sharp contrast to the \u201csuper budget\u201d rooms in its hotels. Guests must pay to use Wi-Fi or to get a remote control for their TV, while some rooms are cheaper because they have no windows at all. EasyHotel said: \u201cWhile it seeks consensus, the board of easyHotel recognises that from time to time there may be differences over the approach to the implementation of the agreed strategy.\u201d Sources close to easyHotel said it was understandable that costs would rise while the company was investing in expanding its franchised and owned hotel network. But easyGroup sources said it was less concerned about business costs than pay. \u201cHis [Haji-Ioannou\u2019s] views are clear on shareholder value \u2013 you have to keep your costs under control,\u201d said someone close to the Cypriot-born tycoon. \u201cIt\u2019s depressing that we\u2019re having to go through this yet again.\u201d Haji-Ioannou has been a vocal critic of pay at Fastjet, the airline he helped found, and easyJet, the European no-frills airline.",

Bakkavor \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s biggest ready meals companies, which provides prepared foods from salad to pizza and stir fries to all the major supermarket chains \u2013 has begun a 45-day consultation with 280 agency staff and 30 employees about potential job losses. It hopes to transfer about two-thirds of the staff affected to shifts making hummus, sales of which are rising. On Monday, General Mills also confirmed 265 jobs would be lost with the closure of its factory in Berwick which makes Jus-Rol pastry and Betty Crocker cake mixes. It began producing pastry at the site more than 50 years ago. The GMB union, which represents staff at three Bakkavor product plants in Park Royal, north-west London, said the \u00a332m contract was equivalent to 16% of its turnover. Bakkavor said: \u201cFor some time the business has been impacted by difficult trading conditions in a highly competitive marketplace. We believe Bakkavor Meals needs to adapt to the changing market in which it operates to ensure that it remains and, where possible, becomes more competitive to deliver future growth.\u201d Tony Warr, GMB\u2019s senior organiser, said Bakkavor had proposed a new shift pattern reducing workers\u2019 hours from 40 to 38 a week. \u201cGMB believes it is wrong and totally unnecessary for the company to cut our members\u2019 hours and pay,\u201d he added. Tesco, which is fighting off competition from the fast-growing discounters Aldi and Lidl, has been restructuring its relationships with suppliers as part of efforts to simplify its ranges and cut prices. In November, Carlsberg said it would axe up to 100 UK staff after Tesco stopped stocking some of its beer. Tesco said: \u201cWe have been working to simplifying the range of products we offer in store. As part of this process, we\u2019ve had to make some decisions about certain products we stock. However, we still maintain our long term partnership with Bakkav\u00f6r across our fresh food category.\u201d Industry watchers say UK food suppliers and farmers face increasing pressure from Britain\u2019s supermarket price war, with their profit margins cut by more than a third.",

      "bodyText": "So this is what the last roll of the dice looks like. A further 1,050 jobs are to go at Tata Steel, including 750 at Port Talbot. The South Wales steelworks is Britain\u2019s biggest, accounting for about a third of the country\u2019s total annual production of steel. Every Heinz food tin sold in the UK, every roof of a Nissan Juke car and every new 1p and 2p coin (plated in copper) is made from Port Talbot steel. But Britain\u2019s once mighty steel industry has been brought to its knees by a wave of cheap Chinese product, slowing demand and high energy costs. The onslaught of negative market forces brought the curtain down on 160 years of steelmaking on Teesside, as Thai group SSI shut its Redcar plant at the end of last year. Tata also cut jobs last year, closing sites in Scotland and selling its Scunthorpe mill, which makes steel for the construction and rail industries. Throughout this dizzying death-spiral for Britain\u2019s steel industry, it was always thought Port Talbot was safe. Until now. Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns the remnants of British Steel, has invested \u00a3300m at the site over the last four years, including \u00a3200m to build a new blast furnace. Despite this, the plant is losing a staggering \u00a31m a day and sources say it requires a further injection of \u00a3500m \u2013 for new stripping and rolling mills \u2013 to make it viable.

Locals will hope it can. The town, and the steelworks, are way past their 1960s peak when almost 20,000 people were employed in the plant and Station Road was the bustling commercial hub of the community. It is now a tumbleweed town, full of charity shops, payday loan stores and greasy food eateries. The economic significance of steel stretches way beyond Port Talbot. A study by Cardiff University\u2019s Welsh Economy Research Unit found Tata Steel supported more than 18,000 jobs in Wales and estimated it was worth about \u00a33.2bn to the Welsh economy. Tata may have no short-term desire to cut and run from the ailing plant. But these deep cuts are a telling sign that Britain\u2019s biggest steel mill has been placed on to the critical list.",

      "bodyText": "As George Osborne heads down to breakfast in Davos this week, he should brace himself for a lecture along with his muesli. John Neill, the businessman who spread the Japanese concept of \u201clean manufacturing\u201d around Britain, wants a word with the chancellor about the UK\u2019s woeful productivity record. He is on a mission to change the way Britain works, from restaurants to the NHS, and plans to corner Osborne when they are both at the World Economic Forum. \u201cI hope I bump into him at breakfast at Davos,\u201d says Neill, chairman and chief executive of the car parts company Unipart. \u201cThe opportunity for the nation to massively improve productivity, particularly in the state-run sectors, is huge. We are trying to get people to understand there is so much you can do to improve productivity. You don\u2019t need capital. It\u2019s creativity before capital, or grey matter before the green matter,\u201d he says. Neill is speaking from long experience, or what he would probably call a \u201cjourney\u201d. In 1976, aged 29, he was put in charge of the parts and service division at state-owned automotive empire British Leyland. In the 1980s he led a management buyout of the division, and when he found himself saddled with some of the worst factories in Britain, Neill scoured the globe for ways to turn them around. Unipart now has a turnover of \u00a3700m, with more than 6,000 employees around the UK and overseas. What the company has learnt along the way about eliminating waste, improving customer service, and training employees has been turned into the Unipart Way, a method its consultancy arm exports to other organisations such as HMRC and National Grid. Neill is evangelical about the Unipart Way, which is used in every part of the company, from the factory floor to the finance department. The chief executive even put the scheme into place at the company canteen after a long wait to be served one day prompted him to fire the outside catering company, hire in the staff and retrain them. Walking around Unipart\u2019s head offices on the outskirts of Oxford, Neill proudly declares: \u201cYou will meet people who I would argue are the best in the world at what they do, whether it\u2019s picking parts or baking cakes.\u201d The learning journey Unipart\u2019s proprietary version of leanness comes with its own corporate university, where huge billboards urge visitors to \u201cjoin us in the productivity revolution\u201d. It is there that Neill expounds the Unipart Way to newcomers with the help of videos, wall charts and catchphrases such as \u201clearn at 10 and do at 11\u201d or \u201cgate to great\u201d \u2013 in what Unipart also calls the \u201clearning journey\u201d. As he walks the university\u2019s long corridors, the industry veteran is always ready with a neat turn of phrase, statistic or anecdote. He recalls asking virtuoso Chinese pianist Lang Lang about practice, he quotes studies about creative thinking and, when challenged that the Unipart Way could be seen as a little cultish, he shoots back: \u201cIt\u2019s a philosophy rather than a cult. But it is a culture.\u201d One recent guest was Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe, who has spoken about the \u201cpuzzle\u201d over sluggish UK productivity growth since the crisis. Neill invited Cunliffe to the Unipart university to argue that the \u201cproductivity puzzle\u201d was no such thing. It is the same message as Unipart\u2019s national productivity campaign, which was launched last year to tackle the country\u2019s record productivity gap. The idea is to \u201ctake away the excuse that it\u2019s a puzzle\u201d, and therefore the attitude of \u201cwell, what can we do?\u201d. \u201cIf the whole nation thinks that then we will never change it,\u201d says Neill. The UK has plenty of catching up to do based on the latest figures, which suggest that output per hour from UK workers was 20 percentage points below the average of other leading industrialised nations. Neill\u2019s pitch to Cunliffe, and anyone else who will listen, is that productivity in the best British manufacturing has come on in leaps and bounds, and that others need to learn from those examples. The Bank\u2019s deputy governor himself has remarked that if productivity growth in the UK economy as a whole had matched that of the car industry between 2007 and 2014, the economy would be 30% bigger. The Way ahead So what can be done? Neill\u2019s answer, of course, is to implement the Unipart Way anywhere and everywhere. In practice, his productivity plan means spotting problems and tackling them head on, monitoring and continuously enhancing every process, encouraging employees to suggest improvements, and giving people training and space to think. For him personally that means finding time to read, being mentored by Unipart\u2019s chief digital officer, and going to Davos. Around the Unipart offices and warehouse, the most obvious feature of this lean philosophy is the constant monitoring. Whiteboards everywhere are updated hourly and marked with colour-coded dots to show tasks that are on and off target. This relentless benchmarking is not for everyone, Neill admits, nor is the practice of watching workers to find ways to cut waste. \u201cIn many companies, if you had somebody standing with a clipboard, a stopwatch or a camera watching others, that would be regarded as intimidation or bullying, and you\u2019d get a lot of resentment,\u201d he says. But at Unipart, he argues, people understand the culture is not one of blame, but about making work better. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a conflict between higher productivity and increased satisfaction out of your work. In fact, improving productivity using the Unipart Way increases employee engagement, and we have endless research on this.\u201d Not that everyone buys into the research. Neill recounts infuriating one senior surgeon over what a car parts company could possibly teach healthcare. How to save the NHS But he insists the Unipart Way could save millions for the NHS, or \u201cour Greece\u201d, as Neill dubs the health service. Neill\u2019s view is that the NHS needs a complete overhaul rather than the current \u201cpatchwork quilt\u201d approach. \u201cYou could get the quality up, you could get the cost down, you could improve the culture of engagement, and you could create time for innovation. But you need the whole of the Unipart Way to go in.\u201d Neill does not see that happening, and remarks that it is not his place to deploy Unipart resources to rescue something he cares about. But it weighs on his mind. \u201cUnless we fix the productivity in the health service, I don\u2019t think I want to be old in Britain,\u201d he says. This raises the obvious question of Neill\u2019s own future at Unipart. The company says it does not give out the boss\u2019s age but he is approaching 70. Despite that, he is clearly in no mood to slow down. \u201cI love what I do. So why wouldn\u2019t you keep doing it? I asked [Sir] Martin Sorrell\u2019s chairman when is Martin going to retire, and he said: \u2018Probably a week after he dies.\u2019 That was a good answer.\u201d",

The acquisition of 265 Homebase stores would make Bunnings the second largest home improvement and garden retailer in the UK and Ireland behind B&amp;Q. Wesfarmers told investors it expected to test out its first handful of Bunnings-branded outlets in the UK within a year. It said it could improve on Homebase\u2019s store operations, cut prices, widen ranges, improve service, appeal more to tradesmen and do more online. Homebase\u2019s management team are to be replaced by Bunnings\u2019 staff \u2013 Peter Davis as managing director and Rodney Boys as finance director. However, it is understood Homebase\u2019s current chief executive, Echo Lu \u2013 who joined from Tesco less than a year ago \u2013 has been asked to stay on and help for at least a year. Wesfarmers\u2019 management team told analysts the company had studied the UK market for more than a year before making its move. Richard Goyder, managing director of Wesfarmers, said: \u201cWhile we know this is a decent step offshore, we\u2019ve made this decision following a lot of hard work reviewing the opportunity and assessing the market and we do this with our eyes wide open. Bunnings is well-placed to unlock value from the Homebase business and has a proven track record in delivering growth both organically and through acquisitions.\u201d John Gillam, managing director of the Melbourne-based Bunnings, said: \u201cWe have noted some commentary in the UK claiming that DIY is in decline; we could not disagree with this more. We see a huge market opportunity for good quality home improvement and garden retailing.\u201d Some analysts say the sale of Homebase increases the likelihood of Sainsbury\u2019s returning with a new offer for Argos \u2013 the other business within Home Retail Group. The supermarket has until 2 February to say if it will raise a \u00a31bn offer which Home Retail rejected in December. It had already made clear that the supermarket is not interested in Homebase. Last week, Home Retail boss John Walden insisted Argos was able to stand alone and did not need to be taken over. However, Jamie Merriman, an analyst at Bernstein, said a standalone Argos would struggle to lift sales at its established stores and faced increased costs from the implementation of the national living wage as well as from taking on central costs currently shared with Homebase. The removal of Argos from more than 100 Homebase stores under Wesfarmers\u2019 ownership would also affect sales and profits. She said a deal with Sainsbury\u2019s would mean Argos stores could move into spare space in its supermarkets but she added: \u201cWe have long argued that Home Retail face significant structural challenges at Argos and that like-for-like sales growth is not ensured. We do not believe that an acquisition by Sainsbury\u2019s would dramatically change this.\u201d Home Retail last week warned that profits would be lower than expected this year after a tough Christmas for Argos. Some analysts said the poor performance made a bid from Sainsbury\u2019s less likely as the supermarket is still trying to persuade its shareholders that a bid makes sense. Analysts believe Sainsbury\u2019s would have to bid at least 160p a share to secure a deal although some Home Retail investors have said they want at least 200p. Richard Marwood at Sainsbury\u2019s shareholder AXA Investment Management, said: \u201cThere is some execution risk. That means Sainsbury\u2019s shouldn\u2019t pay a full price and 200p a share is a very full price.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Taavet Hinrikus is a disruptor. As the first employee of the internet phone service Skype, he helped spark a revolution in the way people communicate with each other. Now, Hinrikus is aiming to transform the way people move cash around the world through TransferWise, an online money transmission service. The 34-year-old Estonian is plotting his latest revolution from the unglamorous location of Old Street in London, better known as the silicon roundabout hub where like-minded digital disruptors are based. This week he will take his mission to Davos, the Swiss ski resort where business leaders, politicians and celebrities chew over the hot topics facing the world. He symbolises the new-look Davos man: knowledgeable about \u201cthe fourth industrial revolution\u201d \u2013 the impact of new technology and robots \u2013 that the organisers of the World Economic Forum have selected as this year\u2019s theme. Hinrikus, who is more accustomed to skiing in Davos than holding a hot ticket to the forum, said digital disruptors such as himself are \u201charnessing technology to create change, to create better services, to create a better world Disruption has been around for a long time. The car disrupted the horse, the micro-computer disrupted the mainframe.\u201d The speed and amount of disruption has changed as a result of the internet. Skype, created in 2003 in Estonia, disrupted an industry in which making a call once required the intervention of an operator. Those industries feeling the impact off digital disruption also include the music industry \u2013 \u201cinstead of going to HMV and buying a piece of plastic you sign up to Spotify\u201d \u2013 and transport, in which Uber and Hailo are causing shockwaves. Finance is now on the radar of the digital disruptors. Peer-to-peer lenders are challenging one part of banking\u2019s traditional business while startups are aiming to chip away at the banks\u2019 core current account market by creating mobile-only banks. The industry is no longer protected by bricks and mortar, says Hinrikus. \u201cBack in the days you would build the biggest building in the city and say: \u2018You can trust us\u2019,\u201d he says. The financial crisis changed that as \u201cpeople realised these institutions called banks are really about generating profit and fuelling the greed of the bankers\u201d. The UK government wants to turn London into the world\u2019s capital for financial innovation, so-called fintech. The aim is not only to attract financiers to the UK but also foster competition in a domestic market dominated by the big four banks. Hinrikus views London as the ideal place to run the business, even though 300 of the 450 staff are based in Estonia. \u201cFrom here I can be in Singapore or San Francisco in 12 hours \u2026 It is a unique place where finance meets tech. New York has lots of finance and not so much tech and San Francisco has lots of tech and not so much finance.\u201d He credits Estonia with fostering a spirit of self-reliance, as the communist regime, which fell in 1991, forced individuals to do things for themselves. \u201cEveryone knew how to fix [their] car engine,\u201d he said. TransferWise, launched in 2011, is said to have been valued at $1bn a year ago when the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, backed a fundraising. Marc Andreessen is credited with inventing web browers. Sir Richard Branson and the former chief executive of the US bank Citigroup, Vikram Pandit, are among the other big-name backers. As a so-called unicorn \u2013 a tech startup with a $1bn valuation \u2013 there are concerns that TransferWise could be just hype. The operation is still filing abbreviated accounts, which show a loss for the financial year to March 2014 of \u00a314m. Its website tells the story of how it was created by Hinrikus and his friend Kristo K\u00e4\u00e4rmann: \u201cTaavet had worked for Skype in Estonia, so was paid in euros, but lived in London. Kristo worked in London, but had a mortgage in euros back in Estonia. They devised a simple scheme. Each month the pair checked that day\u2019s mid-market rate on Reuters to find a fair exchange rate. Kristo put pounds into Taavet\u2019s UK bank account, and Taavet topped up his friend\u2019s euro account with euros. Both got the currency they needed, and neither paid a cent in hidden bank charges.\u201d TransferWise matches customers wanting to move money across borders. Hinrikus said it had 450 \u201cpayment corridors\u201d. Its most popular route involves exchanges out of the UK to Spain, Germany and India. Regulated by the city regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, it is subject to the \u201cknow your customer\u201d rules intended to prevent money laundering. Africa, where countries such as Somalia have been locked out of the so-called remittance system, is proving a harder nut to crack, although Nigeria is one country on the continent for which it does offer an exchange rate.",

The car disrupted the horse, the micro-computer disrupted the mainframe.\u201d</p> <p>The speed and amount of disruption has changed as a result of the internet. Skype, created in 2003 in Estonia, disrupted an industry in which making a call once required the intervention of an operator. Those industries feeling the impact off digital disruption also include the music industry \u2013 \u201cinstead of going to HMV and buying a piece of plastic you sign up to Spotify\u201d \u2013 and transport, in which Uber and Hailo are causing shockwaves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"476e7ab7595fbc495ccb932a6c00a3a3a01b02e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/476e7ab7595fbc495ccb932a6c00a3a3a01b02e0/0_265_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Silicon roundabout in Old Street, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Silicon roundabout in Old Street, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finance is now on the radar of the digital disruptors.

The aim is not only to attract financiers to the UK but also foster competition in a domestic market dominated by the big four banks.</p> <p>Hinrikus views London as the ideal place to run the business, even though 300 of the 450 staff are based in Estonia. \u201cFrom here I can be in Singapore or San Francisco in 12 hours \u2026 It is a unique place where finance meets tech. New York has lots of finance and not so much tech and San Francisco has lots of tech and not so much finance.\u201d</p> <p>He credits Estonia with fostering a spirit of self-reliance, as the communist regime, which fell in 1991, forced individuals to do things for themselves. \u201cEveryone knew how to fix [their] car engine,\u201d he said. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/11/foreign-currency-exchange-banks-transferwise\">TransferWise, launched in 2011</a>, is said to have been valued <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/26/transferwise-58m-funding-peer-to-peer-foreign-exchange\">at $1bn a year ago</a> when the Silicon Valley <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/24/andreessen-horowitz-london-virtual-reality-startup-improbable\">venture-capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz</a>, backed a fundraising.

Kristo worked in London, but had a mortgage in euros back in Estonia. They devised a simple scheme. Each month the pair checked that day\u2019s mid-market rate on Reuters to find a fair exchange rate. Kristo put pounds into Taavet\u2019s UK bank account, and Taavet topped up his friend\u2019s euro account with euros.

Hinrikus said it had 450 \u201cpayment corridors\u201d. Its most popular route involves exchanges out of the UK to Spain, Germany and India.

    "webTitle": "Richest 62 people as wealthy as half of world's population, says Oxfam", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The vast and growing gap between rich and poor has been laid bare in a new Oxfam report showing that the 62 richest billionaires own as much wealth as the poorer half of the world\u2019s population. Timed to coincide with this week\u2019s gathering of many of the super-rich at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, the report calls for urgent action to deal with a trend showing that 1% of people own more wealth than the other 99% combined. Oxfam said that the wealth of the poorest 50% dropped by 41% between 2010 and 2015, despite an increase in the global population of 400m. In the same period, the wealth of the richest 62 people increased by $500bn (\u00a3350bn) to $1.76tn. The charity said that, in 2010, the 388 richest people owned the same wealth as the poorest 50%. This dropped to 80 in 2014 before falling again in 2015. Mark Goldring, the Oxfam GB chief executive, said: \u201cIt is simply unacceptable that the poorest half of the world population owns no more than a small group of the global super-rich \u2013 so few, you could fit them all on a single coach. \u201cWorld leaders\u2019 concern about the escalating inequality crisis has so far not translated into concrete action to ensure that those at the bottom get their fair share of economic growth. In a world where one in nine people go to bed hungry every night, we cannot afford to carry on giving the richest an ever bigger slice of the cake.\u201d Leading figures from Pope Francis to Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, have called for action to reverse the trend in inequality, but Oxfam said words had not been translated into action. Its prediction that the richest 1% would own the same wealth as the poorest 50% by 2016 had come true a year earlier than expected. The World Economic Forum in Davos comes amid fears that the turmoil in financial markets since the turn of the year may herald the start of a new phase to the global crisis that began eight years ago \u2013 this time originating in the less-developed emerging countries. Oxfam said a three-pronged approach was needed: a crackdown on tax dodging; higher investment in public services; and higher wages for the low paid. It said a priority should be to close down tax havens, increasingly used by rich individuals and companies to avoid paying tax and which had deprived governments of the resources needed to tackle poverty and inequality. Three years ago, David Cameron told the WEF that the UK would spearhead a global effort to end aggressive tax avoidance in the UK and in poor countries, but Oxfam said promised measures to increase transparency in British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, such as the Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands, had not been implemented. Goldring said: \u201cWe need to end the era of tax havens which has allowed rich individuals and multinational companies to avoid their responsibilities to society by hiding ever increasing amounts of money offshore. \u201cTackling the veil of secrecy surrounding the UK\u2019s network of tax havens would be a big step towards ending extreme inequality. Three years after he made his promise to make tax dodgers \u2018wake up and smell the coffee\u2019, it is time for David Cameron to deliver.\u201d Oxfam cited estimates that rich individuals have placed a total of $7.6tn in offshore accounts, adding that if tax were paid on the income that this wealth generates, an extra $190bn would be available to governments every year. The charity said as much as 30% of all African financial wealth was thought to be held offshore. The estimated loss of $14bn in tax revenues would be enough to pay for healthcare for mothers and children that could save 4 million children\u2019s lives a year and employ enough teachers to get every African child into school. Oxfam said it intended to challenge the executives of multi-national corporations in Davos on their tax policies. It said nine out of 10 WEF corporate partners had a presence in at least one tax haven and it was estimated that tax dodging by multinational corporations costs developing countries at least $100bn every year. Corporate investment in tax havens almost quadrupled between 2000 and 2014. The Equality Trust, which campaigns against inequality in the UK, said Britain\u2019s 100 richest families had increased their wealth by at least \u00a357bn since 2010, a period in which average incomes declined. Duncan Exley, the trust\u2019s director, said: \u201cInequality, both globally but also in the UK, is now at staggering levels. We know that such a vast gap between the richest and the rest of us is bad for our economy and society. We now need our politicians to wake up and address this dangerous concentration of wealth and power in the hands of so few.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "More than 7m jobs are at risk in the world\u2019s largest economies over the next five years as technological advances in fields such as robotics and 3D printing transform the world of work. According to a report into the impact of the so-called \u201dfourth industrial revolution\u201d, women will lose out in the workplace as they are less likely to be working in areas where the adoption of new technology will create jobs. The report is published by the World Economic Forum ahead of its annual meeting in Davos, which starts on Tuesday and where one of the major themes is the \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d. The greatest loss of jobs will be white collar and administrative roles, though the WEF survey predicts this will partially be offset by the creation of roles in areas such as computing, maths, architecture and engineering. Healthcare is expected to suffer the highest number of job losses in the next five years, followed jointly by energy and financial services. The industry expected to create the most jobs is information and communication technology, followed by professional services, and media, entertainment and information professions. The report argued that because women are less likely to be employed in the areas where jobs will be created, they will lose out. It said: \u201cThe burden of job losses seems to fall equally on women (48%) and men (52%). However, given that men represent a larger share of the overall job market than women, this even spread translates into a widening of the employment gender gap, with women losing five jobs for every job gained compared with men losing three jobs for every job gained. \u201cGiven women\u2019s low participation in STEM [science, technology, engineering, mathematical] professions, one of the fastest-growing areas of job creation, women stand to gain only one new STEM job for every 20 lost across other job families, whereas the ratio for men is one new job for every four lost elsewhere,\u201d the report said. Women, though, are expected to progress into more senior roles, with the report predicting a 9% increase in women holding mid-level positions by 2020, and a rise of up to 12% in the number of senior positions held by women. The report was compiled after interviews with human resources professionals in 15 of the world\u2019s largest economies, including Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the US. Together, these economies account for 65% of the global workforce. Business leaders have warned about the impact of technology on jobs in the past. Antony Jenkins, the former chief executive of Barclays, warned last year that banking was reaching an \u201cUber moment\u201d, when the number of people employed in the financial services sector could decline by as much as half over the next 10 years.",

The industry expected to create the most jobs is information and communication technology, followed by professional services, and media, entertainment and information professions.</p> <p>The report argued that because women are less likely to be employed in the areas where jobs will be created, they will lose out. It said: \u201cThe burden of job losses seems to fall equally on women (48%) and men (52%). However, given that men represent a larger share of the overall job market than women, this even spread translates into a widening of the employment gender gap, with women losing five jobs for every job gained compared with men losing three jobs for every job gained.</p> <p>\u201cGiven women\u2019s low participation in STEM [science, technology, engineering, mathematical] professions, one of the fastest-growing areas of job creation, women stand to gain only one new STEM job for every 20 lost across other job families, whereas the ratio for men is one new job for every four lost elsewhere,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>Women, though, are expected to progress into more senior roles, with the report predicting a 9% increase in women holding mid-level positions by 2020, and a rise of up to 12% in the number of senior positions held by women.</p> <p>The report was compiled after interviews with human resources professionals in 15 of the world\u2019s largest economies, including Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the US. Together, these economies account for 65% of the global workforce.<br></p> <p>Business leaders have warned about the impact of technology on jobs in the past. Antony Jenkins, the former chief executive of Barclays, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/25/banking-facing-uber-moment-says-former-barclays-boss\">warned last year that banking was reaching an \u201cUber moment\u201d</a>, when the number of people employed in the financial services sector could decline by as much as half over the next 10 years. </p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The price of oil has briefly fallen below $28 to its lowest point for 13 years on concerns about a worsening supply glut after sanctions on Iran were lifted, allowing the country to resume oil exports. The global benchmark of Brent crude tumbled to as low as $27.67 in Asia on Monday \u2013 a fall of 4.4% on Friday\u2019s close \u2013 before rebounding to trade at $28.52 at 5am GMT. The last time Brent closed below $28 was in November 2003. Iran is ready to increase its crude exports by 500,000 bpd, its deputy oil minister said on Sunday. Daily global demand is more than 80m bpd. \u201cThe drop in price was due to the western sanctions on Iran being lifted. This means we will be seeing a bigger oil glut with Iranian crude exports coming back to the market,\u201d said Daniel Ang, an analyst at Phillip Futures. The United States and the European Union lifted the sanctions on Sunday after the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog confirmed that Iran had complied with its obligations under a landmark deal last year to curb Tehran\u2019s programme. The oil price rout is also hurting stock markets, with Asian shares sliding to near their 2011 troughs on Monday, stoking further worries about a global economic downturn. There was also nervousness ahead of Tuesday\u2019s release of China\u2019s economic growth figures for 2015. The data is widely expected to reveal that the economy grew by less than the official target of 7%, amounting to its slowest rate for 25 years. In Japan the Nikkei average was down 1.5% and in Australia the ASX/S&amp;P200 had fallen 0.8% by 5am GMT. In China both the CSI300 index of leading shares and the Shanghai Composite index were up slightly at the lunch break having recovered from losses earlier in the day as China\u2019s central bank continued its efforts to support the yuan. China\u2019s central bank said on Monday it would start implementing a reserve requirement ratio (RRR) on offshore banks\u2019 domestic deposits, in what appeared to be its latest attempt to stem speculation in the yuan and manage money flowing in and out of the country. The RRR is currently zero. \u201cGrowth keeps slowing ... Lower commodity prices, including oil, partly reflect weakening demand itself. In addition, the downturn in mining [investment] and the declining income of commodity producers is weighing on exports from Asia,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC, Hong Kong. Some analysts believe Tuesday\u2019s GDP figures could build pressure for a weaker yuan, adding to the swirl of uncertainty about whether the Chinese leadership wants the currency to rise or fall. \u201cThe Chinese yuan has been caught up in a vicious circle than can but lead to further depreciation of the currency,\u201d Nordine Naam, an analyst at brokerage Natixis, said. \u201cConcerns over the extent of the slowdown in Chinese growth risk fuelling capital outflows and in turn a further depreciation of yuan, to which the People\u2019s Bank of China seems resigned,\u201d Naam said, despite attempts by the central bank in the last week to support the currency. ANZ bank said on Monday that it expected the new iranian supply to put further downward pressure on oil prices. \u201cThe lifting of sanctions on Iran should see further downward pressure on oil ... in the short term,\u201d ANZ bank said on Monday. \u201cIran\u2019s likely strategy in offering discounts to entice customers could see further downward pressure on prices in the near term.\u201d The international crude market is currently awash with supplies, boosted by high production levels from the Opec cartel and US shale oil. Opec late last year rejected calls for the group to slash output and perk up prices, preferring to fight for market share with competitors.",

The Australian dollar was buying US68.60c after hitting a seven-year low on Friday. China will publish growth figures for the final quarter of 2015 on Tuesday. Experts believe that the figures will show that the economy grew at its slowest rate for 25 years after a tough 12 months for the world\u2019s second largest economy. It will also release retail sales, production and investment figures. The median prediction in a poll by Agence France-Presse of 18 economists put expansion at 6.9% \u2013 down from 7.3% the year before. The figure would be the weakest growth in the People\u2019s Republic since the 3.8% of 1990, a year after the Tiananmen Square crackdown rocked the country and isolated it internationally. Growth will slow further this year, the survey forecast, with the median projection for 2016 coming in at 6.7%. More evidence of a China slowdown came on Sunday with official figures showing that China\u2019s power consumption in 2015 rose 0.5% from a year earlier to 5.550 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh). Reuters calculated the numbers released by the national energy administration suggest that electricity use \u2013 often seen as a useful proxy for economic activity in a country where GDP statistics are not widely trusted \u2013 dropped 2.1% compared with 2014. Nomura, the Japanese bank, thinks China\u2019s growth is around 5.8% per year. \u201cThe real economy will continue the downturn because of destocking, the reduction of overcapacity and deleveraging,\u201d the bank\u2019s economist Zhao Yang said, citing in particular declining investment in property, once a booming sector. \u201cI don\u2019t think economic growth will bottom out in 2016,\u201d he added. \u201cIt will be under rather big downward pressure for the next two to three years.\u201d Some analysts thought that Tuesday\u2019s GDP figures would build pressure for a weaker yuan, adding to the swirl of uncertainty about whether the Chinese leadership wants the currency to rise or fall. \u201cThe Chinese yuan has been caught up in a vicious circle than can but lead to further depreciation of the currency,\u201d Nordine Naam, an analyst at brokerage Natixis, said. \u201cConcerns over the extent of the slowdown in Chinese growth risk fuelling capital outflows and in turn a further depreciation of yuan, to which the People\u2019s Bank of China seems resigned,\u201d Naam said, despite attempts by the central bank in the last week to support the currency.",

      "bodyText": "More properties have become available for first-time buyers and prices have stopped rising, in what the property website Rightmove says is the first evidence that the chancellor\u2019s clampdown on buy-to-let is working. Rightmove said there had been a 6.6% jump in \u201cfresh-to-the-market\u201d two-bed flats over the past year, the most sought-after sector in the first-time buyer market. Availability of two-bed flats is now at its highest since 2007, according to Britain\u2019s biggest property portal, which suggested some buy-to let landlords may be selling up before changes to tax relief and stamp duty come into force. Prices for two-bed flats are static. Rightmove director Miles Shipside said: \u201cWith the monthly price increase in this sector at a near standstill (+0.1%, +\u00a3209), this suggests that some of the dynamics of the changing tax regime for buy-to-let investors are starting to play out sooner than expected. \u201cFor several years buy-to-let investors have been enticed by high tenant demand and attractive returns, but as their window of opportunity starts to close it already appears to be opening wider for first-time buyers.\u201d In the summer the chancellor, George Osborne, cut tax reliefs for buy-to-let landlords, and in the autumn statement he increased stamp duty on investment properties. Meanwhile, prices in the mainstream property market continue to rise. Rightmove said the price of property coming to market was up by 0.5% (+\u00a31,509) in January compared with December. Demand as measured by visits to the Rightmove website in the first working week of 2016 was up by 21% on the same period in 2015. There is little sign of relief for struggling tenants, with separate data showing rents are rising. The Countrywide lettings group said the average rent in the UK rose by 3.1% in 2015, with the east of England showing the highest growth. However, Countrywide\u2019s figures suggest that in London rents have hit a ceiling of affordability. It said rents in the centre of the capital rose just 0.5% in 2015, and that the number of under-25-year-olds able to rent privately was tumbling. \u201cAs rents continue to increase and outpace earnings in the capital, younger people and those in lower income brackets have found it harder to remain in the capital, particularly in central areas,\u201d the group said. Countrywide research director Johnny Morris said: \u201c2016 looks to be a complicated year for landlords. The additional 3% stamp duty charge, stricter regulation and changes to tax relief from 2017 onwards will all take their toll on investor sentiment and impact behaviour. \u201cWith stock at a premium, the smaller landlords who decide to sell up will add upward pressure to rents, although any rises will be tempered by affordability pressures.\u201d",
