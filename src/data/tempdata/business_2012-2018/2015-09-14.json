      "bodyText": "The seventh anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers falls on Tuesday. By the end of this week, the US may have raised interest rates for the first time since June 2006, marking the moment when a version of financial normality is restored. Federal Reserve policymakers meet on Thursday for the most keenly anticipated financial event of the year. Should the Fed \u2013 finally \u2013 take the plunge and raise rates? The answer is yes. Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief economist David Folkerts-Landau puts it well: there\u2019s never a good time to go to the dentist, but you know delaying it can have consequences. One of those consequences would be the perception that US policymakers can be blown off course by a modest upset in financial markets. The slowdown in China has meant stock markets have had a rough couple of months but let\u2019s keep some perspective: the Dow Jones Industrial Average is about 10% below its springtime highs but that is after a six-year bull run in which US share prices have more than doubled. It\u2019s not the job of the Fed to underwrite stock markets. A related argument \u2013 and the source of late lobbying from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 says a US rate hike now could turn China-related tensions in emerging markets into a full-blown crisis. That\u2019s clearly a worry but, again, there are risks in the Fed standing still if inaction just creates another dollar-borrowing binge outside the US. Even in emerging markets many central bankers argue that further delay would be more damaging than an actual US rate rise. Maybe everybody would calm down if the Fed ladled on a few soft words about future rate rises being gradual. In the current low-inflation climate, it\u2019s clearly possible for the Fed to construct reasons for standing still for another month or two. In the end, though, the argument for acting is simple: near-zero rates were meant to be an emergency measure and, on current form, the US economy is no longer in the sick bay. Is Justin King on terra firma in new role? It was interesting to hear Justin King, the former Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, last week mention Four Seasons Health Care as one of the companies where he would try to add value in his new job as vice-chairman at Terra Firma, Guy Hands\u2019 private equity outfit. Good luck to King but the financial crisis at the UK\u2019s biggest care home provider, one of the larger investments in Terra Firma\u2019s portfolio, looks deeper than the one he faced from the outset at Sainsbury\u2019s more than a decade ago. The credit rating agency Moody\u2019s spelled out a few facts last week when downgrading some of Four Seasons\u2019 classes of debt deep into junk territory. For example: earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) fell from \u00a333.4m to \u00a320.8m in the last half year; there is a shortage of nurses in the UK, driving up costs; fees from local authorities are under pressure; occupancy rates are lower than a year ago; and the new \u201cnational living wage\u201d lies around the corner. Many of those operational factors affect all care home operators, which is why the sector is lobbying central government to shovel cash to local authorities to avert a crisis. Fees in England have fallen 5% in the last five years in real terms, it is argued, and failing care homes always create a political storm, as the Southern Cross fiasco demonstrated four years ago. The well-connected King, perhaps, can help with the industry\u2019s lobbying. But he would be hard pressed to explain why his new ally, Hands, thought it a good idea to load Four Seasons with so much expensive debt. The company had net borrowings of \u00a3514m at the end of June, or roughly 10 times ebitda in the past 12 months. What\u2019s more, the two main classes of debt carry interest rates of 8.75% and 12.25%. All options are being considered in the current financial review, management said a fortnight ago. Jolly good but, given this industry\u2019s record, it\u2019s late in the day to realise that care homes and over-leverage do not mix well. Corbyn\u2019s energy policy could be a drain \u201cThe perceived political risk faced by the sector, which had eased in recent months, may be about to increase again,\u201d says Peter Atherton, Jefferies energy analyst, dryly. You bet. The pledge by Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour leader, to renationalise the UK\u2019s energy industry could cost up to \u00a3185bn, Atherton calculated a few weeks ago. That\u2019s a good reason to think it will never happen, even in the unlikely event that a Corbyn-led party wins the general election in 2020. But if the official opposition is committed to full renationalisation, don\u2019t expect government policy to get any easier for the companies.",

      "bodyText": "The TV debate later may rest more than anything else on swaying women, the vast majority of whom account for the 10% of voters who have declared they are still undecided ahead of Sunday\u2019s elections, says our correspondent Helena Smith. She reports: In a political culture that is highly influenced by personalities, tonight\u2019s debate could be decisive for either camp. The conservative New Democracy leader, Vangelis Meimarakis, who has worked his way up through the party, at one time heading its youth wing, will make much of his experience. But insiders tonight are also saying the political veteran will have to make a mark on women - and in this regard they are not displaying the optimism with which they have greeted polls in recent days. \u201cIf it were up to men we might win it hands down,\u201d one well-placed source has just confessed. \u201cMen back Meimarakis but women just love Tsipras, especially [those] in public sector jobs. And that is going to be hard to beat.\u201d In private, conservatives also say they fear left-wingers are finally rallying around Tsipras with many privately admitting that Syriza will emerge as the first party which under Greek law will enable it to clinch the 50-seat bonus. \u201cThose who remain undecided are [mostly] women,\u201d said one former female New Democracy MP. \u201cAt the end of the day they are going to rally around Syriza because they don\u2019t want the last seven months to be a parenthesis when the left finally got into power and was soon booted out. That, at least, is how a lot of us are feeling but anything could happen in tonight\u2019s debate.\u201d On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for now, so thanks for all your comments. A new poll before the Greek election shows Syriza and New Democracy neck and neck: But in terms of the party leaders, New Democracy\u2019s Meimarakis is ahead of Syriza\u2019s Alexis Tsipras: Markets are (mostly) lower following more disappointing Chinese economic figures which cast doubt once more on the outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy, and sent commodities such as copper and oil sliding again. At the same time there was a great deal of caution ahead of this week\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting. Until recently traders believed a US rate rise was almost inevitable, but the volatility since China devalued its currency amid the poor data has left investors uncertain about how the Fed will act. And markets hate uncertainty. So the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 33.17 points or 0.54% to 6084.59 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.67% at 4518.15 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB dropped 0.96% to 21,553.80 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.43% at 9696.4 Germany\u2019s Dax was an exception, clinging on to a 0.08% rise to 10,131.74 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 77 points or 0.47% lower. Over in Greece the digs are starting even before the TV debate between Syriza\u2019s Alexis Tsipras and Vangelis Meimarakis of New Democracy: US consumer expectations for inflation fell last month to their lowest level for more than two years. A survey released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ahead of this week\u2019s US central bank meeting on interest rates showed inflation expectations to 2.9% for three years hence. That is down from 3% in July, and is the lowest since June 2013. Expectations for inflation a year ahed fell from 3% to 2.8%. The full report is here. Greek newspaper Kathimerini has been looking at the debate later, which will see Alexis Tsipras and Vangelis Meimarakis attempt to sway undecided votes ahead of Sunday\u2019s poll. It reports: Greece\u2019s two political heavyweights will have undecided voters in their sights on Monday in a final televised head-to-head debate before national elections, both seeking the elusive soundbite that might break a deadlock in opinion polls. With Sunday\u2019s ballot looming, the leftist Syriza party of former prime minister Alexis Tsipras and the New Democracy conservatives led by Vangelis Meimarakis have been stuck in the same place in the surveys for several weeks - virtually neck and neck and well short of parliamentary majority. Their respective personal popularity ratings have also stagnated around or slightly below 45 percent. Both men have so far given loyal voters little reason to switch allegiance, having devoted much of their campaigns to trading accusations over the country\u2019s ailing economy, institutionalized corruption and responses to the refugee crisis. But voters yet to decide which party to back or intending to abstain altogether - up to a fifth of the electorate according to some polls - offer a clearer target. \u201cThis debate is crucial mainly because of the big number of undecided voters and those who don\u2019t want to vote,\u201d Dimitris Mavros of pollsters MRB said. \u201cThe question is who will be more convincing.\u201d Full report here. A lack of data today has seen markets continue to drift mostly lower, Germany\u2019s Dax being a notable exception. Tuesday sees UK inflation figures, which could see consumer price inflation move back to zero, as well as US manufacturing and retail sales figures. The American data will be closedly watched as the Federal Reserve meets to consider whether or not to raise US interest rates. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at SpreadEx, said: There was no real news to work with this afternoon, nothing to de-fog the market-confusing mist surrounding the Fed\u2019s current position in regards to a September rate-hike. Tomorrow afternoon could help provide some much needed clarity, as the US releases its Empire State manufacturing index, industrial production and retail sales figures; then again it could not, with analysts expecting another muddled set of numbers. The Dow is currently 10 points lower, off its worst levels, while the FTSE 100 is down around 11 points. Mining shares have reversed early gains, as copper prices fall in the wake of the earlier disappointing data from China and oil prices slide again. Brent crude is 1.95% lower at $47.20 a barrel. The Dax is holding onto its gains, up 0.42% but European shares are likely to react on Tuesday to the debate on Monday evening in Greece between Syriza\u2019s Alexis Tsipras and New Democracy\u2019s Vangelis Meimarakis. Campbell said: The polls suggest the race will go down to the wire, so this final TV debate could provide a decisive moment as Tsipras moves to defend his record as leader. Ahead of the debate, the Athens market has slipped 0.12% to 673 points. The Bank of England\u2019s Andy Haldane has finished his twitter Q&amp;A, harking back to the start of the session: Back at the Bank of England, Andy Haldane is getting into the swing of Twitter - being careful to ignore those plucky correspondents asking the chief economist outright how he intends to vote on interest rates over coming months. As a little reminder, Haldane stands out as the member of the nine-person Monetary Policy Committee, who not so long ago warned that hiking rates too soon from their record low 0.5% level could derail the recovery. He even suggested he could vote for a cut. I believe the Twitter hashtag here would be #HowLowCanTheyGo Those Dovish remarks probably prompted these (unanswered) questions in today\u2019s Twitter Q&amp;A: In the same #TellUsAboutRates vein: (That refers to a speech by Haldane\u2019s MPC colleague Kristin Forbes last week, raising the prospect of a rate hike sooner than markets expect) It is often what central bankers don\u2019t say that is most interesting. But here is a taste of what Haldane is saying: *FPC= Financial Policy Committee Haldane is taking questions till 3.30pm BST. Wonder what he is making of the whole experience? He asked in a speech earlier this year what Twitter and shorter attention spans told us about changing human brains and the prospects for economic growth. Markets are likely to remain volatile ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting. Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, told Reuters: The uncertainty is so high in regard to the [interest rate] announcement... it leaves investors a little bit paralysed relative to what to do in anticipation. Meanwhile Wall Street has opened sharply lower, helping to accelerate declines in other markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 93 points or 0.58%, as investors remain nervous about a slowdown in China and uncertain about the outcome of this week\u2019s US Federal Reserve interest rate meeting. The Dow\u2019s decline has helped push the FTSE 100 0.7% lower, while France\u2019s Cac is down 0.36%. However Germany\u2019s Dax is just about in positive territory, up 0.02%. This is the tweet Haldane is referring to, when the then Shadow Chancellor sent out a tweet with just his own name on it, which subsequently became an internet meme: And the Haldane Q&amp;A begins with this: Bank of England policymaker Andy Haldane will shortly be holding a question and answer session on Twitter, details here: Apple\u2019s new launches seem to have gone well, according to the company. Reuters reports: Apple said sales of its new iPhones were on pace to beat the 10 million unit sales it logged during the first weekend of sales last year. The company did not disclose the specific number of preorders it received. Analysts had expected the company to log about 4.5 million preorders, in comparison with 4 million during the period last year. The company said demand for iPhone 6S Plus, the larger phone, exceeded its forecasts for the preorder period. The iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus will begin shipping on September 25. The news has given support to a key supplier to Apple. UK chip designer Arm has seen its shares climb 1.6% on optimism about the new Apple products, pushing it to the top of a faltering FTSE 100, currently down 0.48%. The early gains in Europe continue to fizzle out as traders predict an opening dip on Wall Street: Today is the seventh anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Autum 2008 was a truly amazing time, as the titans of Wall Street and the City faced the abyss and the pillars of capitalism wobbled. Seven years on, has much really changed? No, argues Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank. He writes: We have learned nothing from history. Debt replaced productivity and the banks today have tougher regulations but also unprecedented \u201cfree money\u201d from the central banks. Banks, politicians and central banks have created an unholy trinity where each institution is co-dependent on each other to maintain the power. But no one can afford to face reality and stop the merry-go-round of mal-investment and excessive focusing on monetary policy despite neither history nor practice having any evidence that the trifecta can deal with growth, jobs or productivity. If anything, the proof shows the opposite. Lehman could have been a \u201creal crisis\u201d, a real turnaround, a proper paradigm shift. But instead we bought time \u2013 the one thing we should not buy but use effectively. The past seven years became time wasted as the economy and society went into a standstill. The elections across Europe are showing us how the social fabric is under attack, and the lack of jobs, innovation and growth are the end score for this experiment in futility. Jakobsen argues that this post-crisis period is almost over, as the era of cheap money from accomodative central bank ends. The next seven years will be lean, but positively lean. The cost of capital will rise, removing non-productive investment and probably hurt stock markets, which became safe havens under the fat years or pretend-and-extend squared, but that\u2019s good news. The absence of much serious news today (alas) is dragging the European stock markets slowly into the red. The FTSE 100, German DAX and French CAC are all down between 0.2% and 0.4%, as traders prepare to be underwhelmed by the opening of Wall Street in 40 minutes. Investors seem happy to sit on the sidelines until we hear from the Federal Reserve on Thursday (will they, or won\u2019t they raise rates?). As Connor Campbell of SpreadEX explains: The outcome of Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s FOMC meeting is still unclear, leaving investors with the unenviable task of trying to second guess the central bank. The oil price is dipping today, pushing the price of a barrel of Brent crude down by 1% to $47.58 per barrel. Today\u2019s weaker-than-expected Chinese factory output and business investment data is fuelling concerns that energy demand is falling. We still have some way to go to reach Goldman Sach\u2019s prediction of $20 per barrel oil, though. Some news! Ghana\u2019s central bank has just hiked interest rates, to an eye-watering 25% (from 24%). Central bank governor Henry Kofi Wampah said the move would fight inflation, which is currently running over 17%. Ghanaians must hope the move provides some to their currency, the cedi, which has tumbled against the US dollar this year. That\u2019s a major problem for citizens who have taken out mortgages in dollars, and seen their repayments soar. Chinese investors were unnerved by a new clampdown against suspected market abuse, the Financial Times reports. That helped to send the stock market down by as much as 4% today, before closing 2.7% lower -- its biggest loss in three weeks. The FT says: The China Securities Regulatory Commission late on Friday announced punishments of two wealthy individual investors for manipulating 13 different stocks using fake buy orders to temporarily boost their prices. That sent a chill through short-term speculators on Monday. \u201cFor \u2018drive-by money,\u2019 this was a major blow. Now they lack any impetus to go long,\u201d said Zhu Bin, analyst at Southwest Securities in Shanghai. Mr Zhu also said downward momentum increased after the Shanghai Composite broke below the psychologically important 3,200 level. Following the late-day rally, which pushed the index as low as 3,049, the index closed at exactly 3,200. More here: China stocks\u2019 worst day in nearly three weeks after punishments There are four potential outcomes from Thursday\u2019s eagerly awaited Federal Reserve meeting, say analysts at Royal Bank of Canada. no interest rate hike/no signal; no hike but a signal that, with markets having calmed down since late August, the Fed is ready to hike in Oct or Dec if things remain calm; a hike coupled with a signal that rate rises will be extremely slow (a commitment to keep rates on hold for x months or \u201cone and done for now\u201d); and a hike indicating the start of a tightening cycle, albeit slower than the ones we have seen in the past. RBC\u2019s official call is still that the Fed will hike rates at the September meeting, but that would be \u201cdifficult\u201d as the markets expect borrowing costs to remain on hold. Sue Trinh of RBC explains: No hike will look bizarre in the face of what is likely to be an upward revision to the Fed\u2019s 2015 GDP forecast and a downward revision to their unemployment rate projection. We would expect Yellen to be questioned on that at the press conference, and any commitment to a hike in Q4 would be positive for the US dollar, pushing back on those who don\u2019t believe the Fed will ever raise rates. The two men battling to lead Greece will go head-to-head in a nationally televised debate at 9pm tonight (7pm BST). The clash between Syriza\u2019s Alexis Tsipras and New Democracy\u2019s Vangelis Meimarakis will help determine which party comes first in Sunday\u2019s general election. The victor will claim the 50 seat bonus available to the winner (out of 300 MPs), allowing them to either govern alone or lead a coalition. Tsipras has been hit by a series of defections to the new anti-austerity Popular Unity party, and also faced criticism for taking Greece to the brink of Grexit before signing up to a third bailout. Support for Meimarakis appears to be rising, though. He\u2019s pledged to work with other parties to rebuild Greece\u2019s economy and implement the new bailout deal. The race remains very tight, as our Athens correspondent Helena Smith explains: One survey, conducted by Public Issue and published in the leftwing party\u2019s newspaper Avgi, indicated that the two parties are stuck in a dead heat on 31% each. Tsipras, however, for whom support has dropped since he signed up to a third, hard-hitting bailout for his country, continued to outpoll his rival on the question of suitability for the post of prime minister. \u201cThe outcome ultimately could be decided by the debate,\u201d said Aristides Hadzis, a political analyst who teaches law and economics at Athens University. \u201cA lot of the 10% who remain undecided are women who come from the Syriza camp and are generally friendlier towards Tsipras. Here\u2019s Helena\u2019s full take: This chart puts today\u2019s decent eurozone factory data into context: Robert Shiller won a Nobel Prize in 2013 for his work on the irrational exuberance that can grip markets. So when he spots a stock market bubble, it\u2019s worth listening. Shiller, the Yale University economics professor, believes that the US stock market is overvalued, and primed to burst. He has told the Financial Times that: \u201cIt looks to me a bit like a bubble again with essentially a tripling of stock prices since 2009 in just six years and at the same time people losing confidence in the valuation of the market.\u201d Shiller has the data to prove his case too -- an index that measures stock market confidence. It is compiled by asking investors if they think the stock market is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued. It\u2019s now heading towards its lowest point since the dot-com bubble ended, in early 2000 (via Business Insider) Shiller isn\u2019t actually predicting that a huge crash is imminent, though: \u201cI\u2019m not looking for any big effect....It\u2019s been talked about for so long, everyone knows that it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s just not much of a big deal.\u201d The latest survey of Europe\u2019s factory sector is out, and it\u2019s better than expected. Industrial production across the eurozone increased by 0.6% year-on-year in July, twice as fast as economists expected. That extends the recovery that began around two years ago: Italian factories performed particularly well, with output jumping 1.1% month-on-month, and Ireland had a stonking month, up over 7%. France, though, suffered a 0.8% decline. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: There was a particularly encouraging jump in Italian production while growth was decent in Spain and Germany. However, a sharp drop in French production fuels concerns over the economy\u2019s potential to bounce back in the third quarter after GDP stagnated in the second quarter. It\u2019s worth remembering, though, that China\u2019s factory sector is growing around three times as fast (6.1% year-on-year). The stock market in China\u2019s Shenzhen, which is heavy with tech stocks, had a particularly bad day: Here\u2019s some more reaction to the latest Chinese data, and today\u2019s drop in the stock market, from Reuters. Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank AG in Singapore: \u201cOverall, the economy is very weak and the central bank may have to continue cutting interest rates and banks\u2019 reserve requirement.\u201d Gu Yongtao, strategist at Cinda Securities: \u201cChina\u2019s economy faces relatively big downward pressure, so investor sentiment remains weak.\u201d European stock markets have risen in early trading, as investors resist the temptation to panic over China. The FTSE 100 is up 46 points, or 0.75%, at 6163, reversing Friday\u2019s dip. Trading floors are primarily concerned with Thursday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, and the possibility of interest rates being raised. A hike seems unlikely in the current climate, with emerging markets such as China struggling. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets explains: As always, a decision on a US interest rate rise is expected to come down to the wire, but it\u2019s not the type of decision to be made either hastily or in the absence of majority consensus within the US Central Bank, and therefore a delay until at least the next meeting (October) seems probable (maybe even December). The markets have woken up to another morning of woes over the China economy, says FXTM Research Analyst Lukman Otunuga. Most market participants were already concerned about the slowing rate of growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy, and the annualised Industrial Production data failing to meet expectations will further concerns. Not only was the figure at 6.1% lower than expected, but growth in fixed-asset investment is now reportedly at its weakest in 15 years. With such weakness being seen across large sections of the Chinese economy, the China markets are going to remain exposed to pressures and it is likely the government will remain on high alert to relieve pressures and induce stability in the domestic markets. Although Premier Li Keqiang remains defiant that expectations of a 7% growth rate for China is achievable, the recent data from China has outlined nothing other than a deep economic downturn and there are already fears that the China data is much weaker than official statistics illustrate. Today\u2019s selloff was mild, compared to the drama of August. But it has still pushed the Chinese stock market down towards an eight-month low: China\u2019s stock markets have just posted their biggest falls since the last week of August, despite a late (and somewhat suspicious) rally. The benchmark Shanghai Composite shed 2.7%, having been down 4% in late trading, as traders reacted to the slowdown in business investment, and subdued factory growth, in August. This latest data follows a 13% tumble in imports last month, adding to concerns that the Chinese economy is softening fast. Analysts at Mizuho Bank reckon the slowdown could encourage the US Federal Reserve to leave interest rates on hold this week: \u201cFurther deceleration in investments and imports plunge remain worrying. This ups the likelihood of more China stimulus, but dampens the Fed jumping the gun.\u201d Russia\u2019s largest port operator has just reported a sharp fall in profits and revenues, highlighting its weak econony. Pre-tax profits at Global Ports halved in the first six months of 2015, as revenue shrank by 25%. The company warned that consumer demand had been hit by Russia\u2019s \u201cchallenging\u201d macro-economic backdrop; ie, people are buying less stuff because the country is in recession. Tiemen Meester, chairman, added: Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect that the market will remain difficult. FastFT have more details. Fears over China\u2019s economy, and the prospect of a US rate rise, have hit Japan\u2019s stock market too. The Nikkei fell 1.6% by the close, amid small losses in Hong Kong and Seoul too. Last weekend\u2019s disappointing Chinese factory output and investment data have raised the pressure on Beijing to launch more stimulus measures. There was one bright spot - retail sales beat forecasts with a 10.8% jump, suggesting some success in rebalancing the economy. Angus Nicholson of IG says China is now exhibiting a \u201cdivergent two-speed economy, as consumption continues to do well while industrial production and investment slow.\u201d He adds: It is thought that factory shutdowns surrounding the World Athletics Championship and WWII commemoration may have affected output somewhat. Nonetheless, the data is still pretty disappointing considering there have been frequent statements by the government, plus expectations in the market that investment would start to pick up in the second half of the year. China\u2019s stock market is heading for its biggest loss in several weeks, after fresh, disappointing, economic data shows that the country\u2019s economy is slowing fast. The Shanghai index has shed 4% in late trading today, in a new bout of angst. The market close in about 30 minutes. The selloff is triggered by the news that China\u2019s factory output grew by just 6.1% year-on-year in August, below expectations of a 6.4% rise. And fixed-asset investment, which tracks business spending on new machinery and plants, grew by 10.9%. That\u2019s the weakest rise since 2000. Economists say that it shows the Chinese economy is weakening, putting the target of 7% growth this year at risk. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s going to be an exciting week. Economists and investors are already looking towards Thursday\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, when America\u2019s interest rates could be raised for the first time since the crisis began. On balance, the Fed is expected to sit tight again, given the recent ructions in the global economy, but no-one knows for sure. Alastair Winter, chief economist at investment bank Daniel Stewart, argues that the time isn\u2019t right for a hike: Were it not so serious, it would be funny that, having hitherto taken enormous risks with expansionary monetary policy that is clearly no longer working, the FOMC might go ahead and tighten just at the point when further delay could be justified. The US economy may be more self-contained than most but it too is participating in the slowdown in global growth and deflationary pressures. And once the Fed meeting is over, we get Sunday\u2019s Greek general election. Tonight, former prime minister Alexis Tsipras of Syriza will debate the leader of the right-wing New Democracy party, Vangelis Meimarakis. Recent polling has shown the two parties neck-and-neck. Having said that, there\u2019s not too much on the agenda today. The only economic data of note is the latest eurozone industrial production survey, for July, at 10am BST. Economists predict monthly growth of 0.3%. And Europe\u2019s stock markets are expected to rise by close to 1%, having lost ground on Friday. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

She reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>In a political culture that is highly influenced by personalities, tonight\u2019s debate could be decisive for either camp. The conservative New Democracy leader, Vangelis Meimarakis, who has worked his way up through the party, at one time heading its youth wing, will make much of his experience. But insiders tonight are also saying the political veteran will have to make a mark on women - and in this regard they are not displaying the optimism with which they have greeted polls in recent days. \u201cIf it were up to men we might win it hands down,\u201d one well-placed source has just confessed. \u201cMen back Meimarakis but women just love Tsipras, especially [those] in public sector jobs. And that is going to be hard to beat.\u201d </p> <p>In private, conservatives also say they fear left-wingers are finally rallying around Tsipras with many privately admitting that Syriza will emerge as the first party which under Greek law will enable it to clinch the 50-seat bonus. \u201cThose who remain undecided are [mostly] women,\u201d said one former female New Democracy MP. \u201cAt the end of the day they are going to rally around Syriza because they don\u2019t want the last seven months to be a parenthesis when the left finally got into power and was soon booted out. That, at least, is how a lot of us are feeling but anything could happen in tonight\u2019s debate.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><em>On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for now, so thanks for all your comments. </em><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55f6f637e4b0dd400d532cb6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-14T16:43:08.855Z\">5.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A new poll before the Greek election shows Syriza and New Democracy neck and neck:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/statuses/643458738188341248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"sl\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> poll [MetronAnalysis]:&#10;Syriza 24,6&#10;ND 24.6&#10;GD 5.6&#10;\u039a\u039a\u0395 4.8&#10;Potami 4.6&#10;PASOK 4.2&#10;LAE 3&#10;EK 3&#10;ANEL 2.3&#10;Undec 9.1 <a href=\"http://t.co/gTUlXxXXem\">pic.twitter.com/gTUlXxXXem</a></p>&mdash; Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/status/643458738188341248\">September 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>But in terms of the party leaders, New Democracy\u2019s Meimarakis is ahead of Syriza\u2019s Alexis Tsipras:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/statuses/643461636167204864\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"lt\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> poll [MetronAnalysis]:&#10;Meimarakis 49&#10;Theodorakis 44&#10;Tsipras 44&#10;Gennimat\u00e0 37&#10;Koutsoumbas 29&#10;Kammenos 27&#10;Lafazanis 16&#10;&#10;Tsipras 3rd!</p>&mdash; Yannis Koutsomitis (@YanniKouts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/status/643461636167204864\">September 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-09-14T16:59:22.239Z\">at 5.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55f6f37de4b0dd400d532ca7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-09-14T16:26:58.158Z\">5.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European investors nervous after Chinese data</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Markets are (mostly) lower following more disappointing Chinese economic figures which cast doubt once more on the outlook for the world\u2019s second largest economy, and sent commodities such as copper and oil sliding again.

The group\u2019s core premium brands saw an increase of 9% in their sales but a planned reduction in the distribution of third party agency brands contributed to the decline. The group said: \u201cThis strategic shift has allowed more focus on the group\u2019s owned portfolio of core premium brands, which saw turnover increase by an impressive 9% year on year.\u201d The independent family-owned distiller said that \u201ccareful nurturing\u201d would deliver long-term growth for Drambuie, which had seen its profits falter before the change in ownership. It said that Drambuie, which is a mix of whisky, honey, heather and spices made to a recipe allegedly passed on by Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746, fitted naturally with its premium-branded portfolio. Sources said that there were plans afoot to further exploit the Drambuie brand but there would be no details for the time being. Strong growth was delivered by the Balvenie and Glenfiddich brands, with Hendricks gin growing strongly across the world. Chief executive Stella David said: \u201cThe success was driven by our constant focus on brand-building and investing for the longer-term. The business and our brands are well positioned to continue their growth in 2015 and beyond.\u201d",

      "standfirst": "<p>Chip designer biggest riser in FTSE 100 on positive report on key customer</p>", 
      "body": "<p>Despite further concerns about China following the weekend\u2019s weak factory output and investment figures, leading shares are heading higher.</p> <p>Traders are already turning their attention to this week\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting, which had been widely expected to see a rise in interest rates until the recent volatility around China.</p> <p>The day\u2019s biggest FTSE 100 riser so far is chip designer <strong>Arm</strong>, up 20.5p at 954.5p. Traders pointed to a number of reasons, including a positive report in Barron\u2019s on Apple, one of the company\u2019s main customers. After weakness last week\u2019s product launches, Barron\u2019s said Apple shares could rally by as much as 50%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Arm is top of the FTSE tree this morning retracing some of the post-Apple weakness last week that took the wind from the sails of its recovery from 2015 lows. Some positive weekend reviews of Apple\u2019s latest product launch/updates/initiatives is serving to offset the initial scepticism voiced by a highly critical investment community (losing its edge?) even if technology geeks and the Apple faithful were more than satisfied, as they tend to be.</p> <p>There is also some digesting of the announcement earlier in the month of Arm\u2019s partnership with chip-rival IBM to strengthen each other\u2019s Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. This is an area focused on connecting devices such as phones and watches to everyday objects such as boilers and fridges, as well as to each other and the cloud. Research firm IDC estimates the market for IoT at $656bn last year with potential to more than double to $1.7bn by 2020 which could be a nice area of growth to be involved in should sales of phones and tablets (Apple and other brands) slow up more than expected.</p> <p> Lastly, the stock could also be one to watch for any China/emerging market rebound, especially after such recent Fed-led market uncertainty. Stimulus hopes from poor China data could be a boost, as could the Fed holding off from a rate hike, putting markets at ease. However, with emerging central market bankers calling on the Fed to get on with it, maybe a hike could prove beneficial. Win-win for the chip architect?</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile ahead of an analyst day next week, Morgan Stanley issued a buy note on Arm:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is the first analyst day for new chief financial officer Chris Kennedy, previously of easyJet, which under his term became active in capital returns with multiple special dividends and ordinary dividend payout increases.

      "bodyText": "Despite further concerns about China following the weekend\u2019s weak factory output and investment figures, leading shares are heading higher. Traders are already turning their attention to this week\u2019s US Federal Reserve meeting, which had been widely expected to see a rise in interest rates until the recent volatility around China. The day\u2019s biggest FTSE 100 riser so far is chip designer Arm, up 20.5p at 954.5p. Traders pointed to a number of reasons, including a positive report in Barron\u2019s on Apple, one of the company\u2019s main customers. After weakness last week\u2019s product launches, Barron\u2019s said Apple shares could rally by as much as 50%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Arm is top of the FTSE tree this morning retracing some of the post-Apple weakness last week that took the wind from the sails of its recovery from 2015 lows. Some positive weekend reviews of Apple\u2019s latest product launch/updates/initiatives is serving to offset the initial scepticism voiced by a highly critical investment community (losing its edge?) even if technology geeks and the Apple faithful were more than satisfied, as they tend to be. There is also some digesting of the announcement earlier in the month of Arm\u2019s partnership with chip-rival IBM to strengthen each other\u2019s Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. This is an area focused on connecting devices such as phones and watches to everyday objects such as boilers and fridges, as well as to each other and the cloud. Research firm IDC estimates the market for IoT at $656bn last year with potential to more than double to $1.7bn by 2020 which could be a nice area of growth to be involved in should sales of phones and tablets (Apple and other brands) slow up more than expected. Lastly, the stock could also be one to watch for any China/emerging market rebound, especially after such recent Fed-led market uncertainty. Stimulus hopes from poor China data could be a boost, as could the Fed holding off from a rate hike, putting markets at ease. However, with emerging central market bankers calling on the Fed to get on with it, maybe a hike could prove beneficial. Win-win for the chip architect? Meanwhile ahead of an analyst day next week, Morgan Stanley issued a buy note on Arm: This is the first analyst day for new chief financial officer Chris Kennedy, previously of easyJet, which under his term became active in capital returns with multiple special dividends and ordinary dividend payout increases. Arm has a strong balance sheet with \u00a3904m in cash and free cash flow yield of 3.5% in 2016 growing to 6.0% in 2020 versus a current dividend yield of 1.0% \u2013 hence we believe there is plenty of room for more returns at Arm, given the relative immunity to the semis cycle. It may be too early for the new CFO to announce a less cautious capital return plan, but we expect the subject to be raised in the Q&amp;A. We remain buyers of Arm in a context of rising royalty rates and with an estimated PE of 32 times in 2015 and 27 times in 2016. Overall the FTSE 100 has climbed 27.03 points to 6144.79, with mining shares among the main risers. The companies shrugged off Chinese concerns, on the basis that further stimulus might be on the cards to boost the country\u2019s flagging economy. BHP Billiton was 20.5p better at \u00a310.78, helped by a buy recommendation from Jefferies. Rio Tinto has risen 42.5p to 2425.5p while Anglo American has added 10.8p to 729.2p.

      "bodyText": "The latest figures on household incomes show that over the past two years income inequality has increased. However, income is only part of the issue. The figures also show that wealth inequality has increased such that (in terms of wealth) Australia is now less equal than ever before. As a general rule, wealth is less equally distributed across households than is income. This is not surprising when you consider that income is subject to taxes and can be apportioned via government benefits. Wealth, on the other hand, is rather less flexible, and it also accumulates. While having a high income one year will give you are pretty good chance of having a high income the next year, the odds are much better that wealth this year will lead to more wealth next year. When we look at the split of income and wealth across households, the difference in equality is quite stark. The poorest 20% of households by income hold 7.5% of total household income, but the poorest 20% of households by net worth (or wealth) hold just 1.1% of total household wealth: To an extent this is a concern, but concerns about wealth are slightly different from concerns about income. A big factor in wealth accumulation is age, and there is not a lot anyone can do to alter that fact. The reality is you are much more likely to have accumulated more assets \u2013 property, vehicles, superannuation \u2013 purely by being in your 50s as opposed to your 20s \u2013 even if a person in his or her 50s is earning the same as a person in his or her 20s. The average age of the head of a household in the poorest 20% of wealth households is 41, but by income it is 58 \u2013 highlighting that a retired person may have a low income but a relatively high amount of wealth: Such aspects always bring with them concerns regarding \u201casset-rich but income-poor\u201d retirees who are receiving government benefits. And while such households do exists, the reality is that being income-rich is much more likely to also see you as asset-rich. A quarter of households in the bottom 10% of wealth come from the poorest 10% income households. Similarly, 35% of the wealthiest 10% of households are from the richest 10% of households when ranked by income: And when we look at government benefits, there is little doubt that they are extremely well targeted according to income, 53% of the poorest households getting over 90% of their income from government benefits. By contrast, 90% of the richest households get none or less than 1% of their income from such benefits: But according to wealth, the distribution is less targeted. While only 5% of median income households get more than half of their income from government benefits, 32% of median wealth households do so: The major reason for this is the reason for most people\u2019s wealth \u2013 owning a house. Across every income range, the family home is the greatest asset \u2013 well in front of other financial holdings, including superannuation: But while the average value of that home for the poorest households is 75% that of the median income household, because the average age of the poorest households is around 10 years older than that of median households, much more of their home loan has been paid off. Thus, the average principle left on a home loan for the poorest income households is a mere 33% of the average $81,000 owed by median income households on their loan: And when we combine assets and liabilities, we again see that the richest by incomes also, on average, will be the richest by wealth (and vice versa): But we shouldn\u2019t fall into the trap of thinking the poorest income households are all retirees living in their own homes with little mortgage left to repay. The poorest 20% of households have the highest level of renters across the income spectrum. Similarly, the richest 20% has the highest level of households either owning their house outright or paying off a mortgage: As we saw last week, income equality has grown over the past two years, and while government benefits have not been able to counter the income growth of the richest 20%, they remain clearly well-targeted. But given the importance of the family home in producing household wealth, housing affordability will be the biggest issue in the years ahead. While wealth accumulates with age, if younger Australians are unable to enter the housing market as did previous generations, wealth inequality will continue to grow.",

Similarly, 35% of the wealthiest 10% of households are from the richest 10% of households when ranked by income:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of households in the bottom &amp; top 10% of wealth by household income\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VEu2R/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And when we look at government benefits, there is little doubt that they are extremely well targeted according to income, 53% of the poorest households getting over 90% of their income from government benefits. By contrast, 90% of the richest households get none or less than 1% of their income from such benefits:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Contribution of government benefits to household income by equivalised household income quintile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qfsuQ/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"500\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But according to wealth, the distribution is less targeted.</p> <p>While only 5% of median income households get more than half of their income from government benefits, 32% of median wealth households do so:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of households that recieve more than 50% of income from government benefts by income &amp; net worth quintiles\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Rr8gP/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The major reason for this is the reason for most people\u2019s wealth \u2013 owning a house.

Similarly, the richest 20% has the highest level of households either owning their house outright or paying off a mortgage:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Housing status by equivalised household income quintile\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nL2cJ/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>As we saw last week, income equality has grown over the past two years, and while government benefits have not been able to counter the income growth of the richest 20%, they remain clearly well-targeted. But given the importance of the family home in producing household wealth, housing affordability will be the biggest issue in the years ahead.</p> <p>While wealth accumulates with age, if younger Australians are unable to enter the housing market as did previous generations, wealth inequality will continue to grow.</p>",
