      "bodyText": "Elizabeth Warren is not thrilled with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. On Thursday, the Massachusetts senator sent a missive to Mary Jo White, SEC chair, telling her she was making \u201ca mockery\u201d of the regulator\u2019s core mission. Warren, a scourge of Wall Street, is disappointed with the agency\u2019s decision to approve Stamford Harbor Capital to act as investment adviser to outside clients. The reason? The firm is associated with Steven Cohen, former manager of SAC Capital Advisors, who pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013 and paid a record $1.8bn fine. Turns out, Cohen indirectly owns Stamford Harbor Capital. He is to receive as much as 50% of client profits, but won\u2019t have any supervisory role, according to Bloomberg. \u201cSteve Cohen owns the entity, but consistent with his January agreement with the SEC he will not supervise the activities of anyone working on its behalf,\u201d Jonathan Gasthalter, a Stamford Harbor spokesman, told Bloomberg. Warren said the SEC\u2019s decision to approve Stamford Harbor makes \u201ca mockery of the SEC\u2019s core mission to \u2018protect investors\u2019\u201d, especially considering that in January SEC barred Cohen from \u201csupervising funds that manage outside money until 2018\u201d. \u201cThe commission has permitted a recidivist hedge fund manager, well-known for his former company\u2019s willingness to evade and ignore federal law, to once again profit from \u2013 and potentially exploit \u2013 investors,\u201d Warren wrote in her letter on Thursday. \u201cThis is an unacceptable outcome from the nation\u2019s primary enforcer of securities laws, and it is the latest example of an SEC action that fails to appropriately punish guilty parties, deter future wrongdoings and protect investors.\u201d When asked about Warren\u2019s letter, the SEC said it will continue scrutinize Cohen\u2019s trading activity. \u201cAs the only law enforcement agency to charge Steven Cohen, the SEC imposed important restrictions, including a supervisory bar plus the additional oversight requirements in the settlement that are even stronger than typical remedies available under the securities law, particularly given the impact of the second circuit\u2019s intervening Newman decision on the charge,\u201d said Andrew J Ceresney, director of the SEC\u2019s division of enforcement. The 2014 decision by the second circuit court in United States v Newman put a higher burden on the US government agencies to prove a requisite relationship between the tipster and the person receiving the tip. According to the decision, agencies such as SEC would have to prove \u201ca meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature\u201d between the source and the recipient of the insider information. \u201cUnder the settlement\u2019s significant requirements, the SEC will scrutinize his trading activity closely going forward to protect investors,\u201d Ceresney said. This is not the first letter Warren has sent to White. Less than a year ago, Warren wrote the SEC chair, calling her a \u201cdisappointing\u201d Wall Street cop.",

The BP row was about actual rewards \u2013 notably chief executive Bob Dudley\u2019s \u00a314m \u2013 whereas the Anglo affair involved sums that may be paid to executives in future. Passions always run higher when pay has already been trousered. The moral of both tales, however, is the same: boards should know when to use common sense. The bone of contention at Anglo was the granting of three times as many incentive shares to executives than a year ago. How did that happen? Because Anglo\u2019s share price had fallen 75% and executives\u2019 incentives are calculated as a percentage of salary; thus a lower share price equalled a greater number of incentive shares. But that fails a common sense test in the context of Anglo\u2019s woes. Management \u2013 potentially \u2013 gets lucky if the share price falls 75% and then recovers to its old level. Long-term shareholders, by contrast, merely get back the value they had in the first place. The company\u2019s defence is that it\u2019s hard to define what\u2019s a \u201clow\u201d and a \u201chigh\u201d share price. That is why the scheme is mechanistic, and cuts both ways. And, anyway, shareholders approved the formula a few years ago, complete with the usual clauses about satisfactory returns on capital and so on. Everything Anglo says is strictly correct but, come on, this was a situation crying out for \u201cdiscretion\u201d, the most under-used implement in remuneration committees\u2019 cupboard. The non-executives are allowed to override the system, but rarely do. As it happens, the Anglo vote coincided with a thoughtful report from the Investment Association, the trade body whose members manage \u00a35.5tn of assets. The association was opining in general terms but one of its recommendations could have been written for BP and Anglo: \u201cDiscretion should be used, both upwards and downwards, rather than committees relying on formulaic outcomes.\u201d Correct. The Investment Association\u2019s overall view is that the current approach to executive pay at UK listed companies is \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. That is hard to dispute when you consider its statistics: the FTSE 100 index is roughly where it was 18 years ago but the era of supposed pay-for-performance has seen executive pay more than treble. The worst actors in this drama are those pay committee directors who wave their formulas, hide behind remuneration consultants and fail to provide an ounce of leadership. Time for VW leadership to cough up over emissions scandal Volkswagen\u2019s agony will not be eased by news from the UK that all best-selling diesel vehicles, from a range of manufacturers, failed to meet EU standards for nitrogen oxide pollution when driven in the real world. Instead, over in the US, VW will be obliged to buy back 480,000 cars as part of a settlement with US regulators of the test-cheating scandal. Throw in compensation for drivers, likely fines plus lawsuits and it is still not possible to say how much the affair will end up costing \u2013 it could be tens of billions of dollars. The German carmaker, one assumes, will offer some form of guess alongside next week\u2019s results. But, by rights, VW should be able to do more to explain how it cheated nitrogen oxide emissions tests in the first place. About 450 experts, we were told last December, were working flat out to get answers since the scandal broke last September. Who authorised the scam and whose bonuses will be reclaimed? All we\u2019ve heard so far, however, is anodyne words about \u201cweaknesses in some processes\u201d and a \u201cmindset\u201d in some quarters that tolerated breaches of the rules.

    "webTitle": "Anglo American latest in FTSE 100 to face protest over chief executive pay", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Mining company Anglo American has become the latest FTSE 100 firm to face a protest over boardroom excess, with more than 40% of investors voting against the \u00a33.4m pay of the chief executive, Mark Cutifani. The move keeps up the pressure on boardroom bosses after no votes at the annual meetings of BP and Smith &amp; Nephew last week and sets the stage for a wave of protests at the raft of annual general meetings of major London-listed companies in the weeks ahead. Anglo American was the worst performing stock on the FTSE 100 last year, its shares dropping 75%. Because Cutifani\u2019s annual share award is a proportion of his salary, he was awarded three times as many shares as the previous year. Almost 42% of investors voted against the remuneration report at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Thursday \u2013 although the final results will not be released until Friday. The Anglo chairman, John Parker, blamed a \u201cvery frenzied\u201d wage debate going on in society at large for the voting setback but promised to come up with a new executive pay policy within 12 months. He told the thinly attended AGM in London that 2015 had been a \u201cvery tough year for us and shareholders\u201d and that he was aware of the strength of feeling about executive pay. \u201cYou can be assured that we are listening to what shareholders say. We will be taking a fresh look at the policy during the next 12 months in order to put it to a fresh round of consultation with shareholders followed by a vote at next year\u2019s meeting,\u201d said Parker. The Church of England pension board was among the shareholders raising concerns about the levels of executive pay during such a tumultuous period for the company. Phil Clarke, a private investor, said he had voted against the remuneration report but accepted his vote was only advisory, adding: \u201cThere is nothing more that you can do.\u201d Cutifani expressed disappointment about the vote which he blamed on the ups and downs of the commodity markets. Speaking after the AGM, he said: \u201cWe are very disappointed but we can understand that given what this industry is like with all this volatility that people are disappointed with the way things have turned out. \u201cIt is always difficult to get the [reward] formula right in any one year but in the end it\u2019s not my decision or a personal conversation, it is society that decides what is fair and how much a footballer or other professional is worth. I understand that debate.\u201d A number of large fund-management groups \u2013 including Legal &amp; General and Hermes \u2013 voted against the package for Cutifani even though his bonus had been reduced by 40% and his salary frozen. Bruce Duguid, director of Hermes EOS, said directors had been issued with roughly triple the number of shares than in the past. \u201cIn the light of the value-creation experienced by long-term owners in recent years, we are concerned about the resulting potential future reward to directors,\u201d he said. Hermes \u2013 which had not voted against the BP report \u2013 had earlier in the day described this AGM season as \u201ca crucial test of how the UK remuneration law works in practice and, importantly, is likely to highlight that boards and remuneration committees in particular need to raise their game\u201d. Hermes\u2019s Hans-Christoph Hirt also urged companies to consider the size of pay deals by forming \u201ca view on what they regard as appropriate and acceptable quantum for executives\u201d. A leading group of investors and companies also sparked debate by issuing a report in which they described executive pay as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d. Meeting under the auspices of the Investment Association, the body had warned that misalignment between executive pay and those outside the boardroom had \u201cresulted in widespread scepticism and loss of public confidence\u201d. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal &amp; General, who had chaired the review, said: \u201cFailure has sometimes been rewarded, and use of median comparators has driven disproportionate rises in executive remuneration. This is ultimately damaging to the listed company sector.\u201d Investors are now turning their attention to HSBC\u2019s annual meeting on Friday and next week to Shire Pharmaceuticals, which handed its chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov, a 25% rise in his salary to $1.7m (\u00a31.2m). Royal London Asset Management (RLAM) intends to vote against the pay deal and abstain from supporting the non-executive who chairs the remuneration committee. Shire said the \u00d8rnskov\u2019s pay reflected the $20bn of stock market value added to the company since he joined in April 2013 a as well as the 128% total shareholder return. His pay deal is \u201cfirmly aligned with shareholder interests\u201d, the company said. Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at RLAM, said the protest at Anglo was an indication that more protests were to come. \u201cI think [the Anglo vote] goes to show that some baords are tone deaf on pay this year,\u201d she added.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A rescue deal for the Tata Steel plant at Port Talbot appears increasingly likely after ministers confirmed they were prepared to part-nationalise Tata\u2019s UK business to attract a buyer in the coming weeks. A new package announced by Sajid Javid, the business secretary, amounts to hundreds of millions of pounds in state support through loans, grants and a possible equity stake, raising hopes that up to 40,000 jobs could be saved. The package was immediately welcomed by the two potential buyers \u2013 Liberty House and a consortium backed by the management \u2013 who said it made the prospect of a deal more attractive although talks are ongoing. Javid had originally insisted that nationalisation was not an option and came in for severe criticism for his reluctance to interfere after Tata announced last month it was pulling out of UK steelmaking. But the UK and Welsh governments jointly declared on Thursday that they would consider taking an equity stake of up to 25% in the steel plants, including Port Talbot in south Wales, amounting to part-nationalisation of the struggling industry. They are also offering debt financing at commercial rates and grants for equipment, which would probably make up the bulk of the financial support. The offer was welcomed by Labour, the trade unions and industry bodies, who said it was an attractive sweetener. But they warned that the government would need to deal with the root of the crisis, which has been blamed on Chinese dumping of cheap steel products. A source with knowledge of the negotiations said there were only two credible expressions of interest \u2013 from Liberty House and the management \u2013 but up to 200 investors had expressed interest in helping to finance the rescue. The consortium behind the proposed management buyout, which includes Welsh billionaire Sir Terry Matthews, said the government\u2019s offer made a rescue deal more attractive. Steve Phillips, the chief executive of the Neath Port Talbot county borough council and spokesman for the consortium, said: \u201cWe think it is a positive step forward in the sense that it gives clarity. \u201cOur whole proposition is not without risk, but who can say theirs is without risk? All we are asking for is a level playing-field, and the government statement is a big step forward in that regard.\u201d A spokesman for Liberty said: \u201cThe UK government announcement is interesting and encouraging and will help our team with their analysis of the Tata opportunity, which is under way at the moment.\u201d Liberty is run by tycoon Sanjeev Gupta and has already bought rolling mills in Scotland from Tata. The deal will also have to clear the European commission but industry sources said this was very possible given that any rescue package would be at commercial rates. Speaking at a steel conference in Brussels, business minister Anna Soubry called for \u201coverly strict\u201d EU state-aid rules to be relaxed. \u201cWhen the UK looked at all of the options \u2013 and I do mean all the options \u2013 one of the biggest problems we had is making sure that any plans we have are compliant with state-aid rules,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to look at state-aid rules to make sure that if we have an industry as vital as the steel industry is, in the particular and exceptional circumstances that it finds itself in, whether there should be some flexibility in what many people otherwise regard as overly strict state-aid rules.\u201d Soubry said a large number of buyers had expressed an interest in purchasing the entire Tata business but that its blast furnaces would \u201cbe the most difficult parts of the set\u201d. Ricardo Cardoso, a spokesman for the competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, would only say: \u201cWe are in contact with the UK authorities on this issue.\u201d Javid will be hoping the announcement brings an end to criticism of him for failing to respond quickly enough to the crisis. He was away on a trade trip to Australia when Tata announced the withdrawal and initially ruled out nationalisation. The government later backtracked and said all possibilities were still on the table. One Conservative source said he believed there had been a change of heart about the extent of government support because David Cameron feared being blamed for the collapse of British steel like Margaret Thatcher and the coal industry. Outlining its package, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said its offer would be tailored to the purchaser\u2019s strategy and financing needs. It is expected that the large majority of the help will be through the provision of debt financing but other options include hybrid convertible debt or a minority equity stake of up to 25%. They are also working to find a solution to the burden of pension liabilities, which are worth almost \u00a315bn and have put off potential buyers. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, said the main blueprint for rescuing Tata involves \u00a31.5bn needed over 10 years, so a 25% of that is \u201chelpful but quite a way short of what is required\u201d. He said a government grant for a generator with environmental benefits could end saving \u00a320m to \u00a325m on energy costs and end up being just as big a sweetener as the debt and equity. The details of the package emerged after a second meeting between Javid and Cyrus Mistry, the Tata Global chairman in Mumbai. Javid said: \u201cThis government is committed to supporting the steel industry to secure a long-term viable future and we are working closely with Tata Steel UK on its process to find a credible buyer. The detail of our commercial funding offer is clear evidence of the extent of that commitment.\u201d Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said the package was welcome but a long-overdue recognition of the need for government support for the sale process. \u201cLabour and the steel unions have been calling for action for weeks; this appears to be a step forward,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this alone will not be enough to save the steel industry.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The European Central Bank president has launched a robust defence of the institution\u2019s independence after criticism from Germany that rock-bottom euro interest rates are hurting savers and fuelling rightwing nationalism. Mario Draghi used his latest press conference on Thursday to counter an attack from Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who had said record low rates were causing \u201cextraordinary problems\u201d for German banks and pensioners and risked fuelling the rise of Eurosceptics in Germany. After leaving eurozone interest rates at zero at the ECB\u2019s latest meeting, Draghi sought to stress loose policy was needed to get inflation back to the central bank\u2019s target of \u201cbelow but close to\u201d 2%. For now inflation remains well short of that and could turn negative again in coming months, he added. Draghi warned that those who threatened ECB independence with \u201ccriticisms of a certain type\u201d were making Europe\u2019s economic problems worse. \u201cWe have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the eurozone not only for Germany,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.\u201d Angela Merkel countered that it was legitimate for Germans to discuss how far interest rates had fallen, but \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t be confused with interference in the independent policy of the ECB, which I support. \u201cThe ECB is independent in its policies,\u201d the German chancellor told reporters while on a visit to the Netherlands. At Thursday\u2019s ECB news conference in Frankfurt Draghi said a range of initiatives announced in March would need time to bear fruit but he insisted the bank\u2019s stance was working. In last month\u2019s unprecedented package of growth-bolstering measures, the ECB cut interest rates to an all-time low, expanded its money-printing programme and reduced a key bank deposit rate further into negative territory. There had been some speculation in financial markets before Thursday that faced with global uncertainties and an ongoing threat of deflation, the ECB could cut rates further still and launch \u201chelicopter money\u201d \u2013 whereby central banks print money so finance ministries can hand it out to citizens to spend. But Draghi was swift to snuff out speculation and said the ECB had not discussed helicopter money. He did emphasise, however, that borrowing costs would stay low and he hinted they could possibly be cut even further. \u201cWe continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time,\u201d the ECB chief said in his opening statement to the press conference. That outlook will infuriate many German savers, frustrated by years of low returns on their pension pots. But Draghi rejected implications that the ECB was responsible for all the problems of pension funds. \u201cIt is clear that pension funds and others, insurance companies, are seriously affected by the low interest rates. I would caution them not to blame on low rates everything that has gone wrong in the sector,\u201d he said. Draghi also renewed the pressure on governments to play a role in shoring up growth in the eurozone, echoing recent comments by the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Christine Lagarde that central banks alone cannot fuel the recovery. \u201cLow interest rates are a symptom of low growth and low inflation. If we want to return to higher interest rates we need to return to higher growth and higher inflation,\u201d he said. Asked about the UK\u2019s June referendum on EU membership, Draghi said: \u201cThe participation of Britain in the EU is welcome,. As for the risk of [Brexit] affecting the stability of the eurozone, the assessment our staff is that the effect will be limited.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The owners of nearly 600,000 Volkswagen vehicles rigged to cheat on emissions tests will have the option to have their cars fixed or bought back by Volkswagen, a judge said on Thursday. Judge Charles Breyer did not give details on how much car owners would be paid but said the deal between Volkswagen, the US government and private lawyers would include \u201csubstantial compensation\u201d. Last month, The senior US district judge threatened a trial if Volkswagen and US officials did not reach an agreement on timing of the repairs by Thursday. \u201cVolkswagen is committed to earning back the trust of its customers, dealers, regulators and the American public,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThese agreements in principle are an important step on the road to making things right. As noted today in court, customers in the United States do not need to take any action at this time.\u201d The agreement will include a fund for corrective efforts over the excess pollution, and Volkswagen will be required to commit other money to promote green automotive technology, said Breyer, who has not yet formally signed off on the deal. US officials and VW have until 21 June to file preliminary proposals on the settlement. Before Breyer signs off on the final settlement, those affected will have a chance to weigh in during a public comment period. The judge did not reveal whether it included details on how the company planned to repair the vehicles. Volkswagen would spend just over $1bn to compensate owners but did not include plans on a vehicle fix in the agreement, a person briefed on the matter who asked not to be identified because the deal had not been made public said on Wednesday. Those plans, and the cost of the fixes, apparently are still under negotiation. With $1bn to spend, it works out to about $1,700 per car. But some owners of newer models who get just a software fix may receive little. About 325,000 owners of older cars that require more extensive repairs likely will get more, because the repairs could affect mileage and performance. The vehicle owners and the US Department of Justice sued the company after it acknowledged in September that it intentionally defeated emissions tests and put dirty vehicles on the road. Analyst Marc-Rene Tonn at Warburg Research estimated the direct financial impact on Volkswagen from the emissions scandal worldwide at \u20ac28.6bn ($32.3bn). The company also faces losses from declines in market share and having to lower its prices to keep customers. Volkswagen was originally set to hold its annual meeting on Thursday but had postponed it ahead of the latest legal ruling in the emissions scandal. The automaker had also delayed releasing its quarterly earnings, which were originally scheduled for 10 March. Both earnings and the annual report will be released a week after Thursday\u2019s hearing, on 28 April. VW\u2019s works councils chairman, Bernd Osterloh, called on US lawmakers to consider the effects of financial penalties on the company\u2019s workforce. \u201cWe very much hope that the US authorities also have an eye for this social and employment-political dimension,\u201d he said a month ago. Any US settlement could influence what happens in Europe and in other countries, according to Tonn. \u201cVery generous payments to US customers may add to some greediness here, too,\u201d he said. Shares in Volkswagen were up 5.6% in early trading in Europe on news of a deal with the government. Volkswagen told its shareholders last year it had set aside $7.3bn to help defray the potential costs of a recall or regulatory penalties. Most outside observers have said that figure is probably far too low. The company faces as much as $20bn in fines for Clean Air Act violations alone, before paying to fix the cars or compensate their owners. \u201cThis is clearly not the end of VW\u2019s legal and regulatory problems. Today\u2019s hearing only covered civil issues with US vehicles and even as to those there are not many specifics but rather an agreement in principle,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. \u201cConsumers may be happy with that if it is generous enough and allows for buybacks.\u201d Tobias pointed out that there are still a number of outstanding issues in the US, including criminal liability and the ongoing investigation by the Department of Justice. The court hearing on Thursday was also expected to touch on a request to add the Federal Trade Commission to the case. The FTC has sued Volkswagen, alleging deceptive advertising. \u201cFor years Volkswagen\u2019s ads touted the company\u2019s \u2018clean diesel\u2019 cars even though it now appears Volkswagen rigged the cars with devices designed to defeat emissions tests,\u201d the FTC chair, Edith Ramirez, said last month. \u201cOur lawsuit seeks compensation for the consumers who bought affected cars based on Volkswagen\u2019s deceptive and unfair practices.\u201d The owners\u2019 lawyers are also seeking documents that Volkswagen provided to the law firm Jones Day, which the company has hired to investigate how the cheating happened.

    "webTitle": "Anglo American pay revolt as 41% oppose remuneration report  - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Germany has responded to the earlier comments from ECB president Mario Draghi. Draghi was countering an attack from German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble who said record low rates were causing \u201cextraordinary problems\u201d for German banks and pensioners . Draghi defended the ECB\u2019s policies and said, \u201cWe obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.\u201d In turn German chancellor Angela Merkel said it was legitimate for Germans to discuss how far interest rates had fallen but \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t be confused with interference in the independent policy of the ECB, which I support.\u201d \u201cThe ECB is is independent in its policies,\u201d she told reporters while on a visit to the Netherlands, according to news agency Reuters. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Legal and General Investment Management, which owns 2.9% of Anglo American, is one of the investors which voted against the company\u2019s remuneration report. It said: The rationale for this instruction centred on the lack of discretion exercised by the Remuneration Committee to scale back Long Term Incentive Awards (LTIP) to Executive Directors at a low share price. These grants are made as a multiple of salary and have the effect of awarding a higher number of shares which could lead to windfall gains in the future. This is not in line with best practice and is stated in our voting policy. At the AGM, approximately 42% of investors opposed this item. We will continue to engage with the company giving constructive feedback on their remuneration structure ahead of the binding policy vote next year. Here\u2019s our report on the investor rebellion at Anglo American: With the recent gains on markets it was probably no surprise that investors have decided to pause for some reflection. The European Central Bank meeting with no change to policy but promises of further action if necessary was seen as a little inconclusive for market sentiment, while in the UK, retail sales and public borrowing figures both disappointed. Analyst Tony Cross at Trustnet Direct said: After the recent run of gains for equities, it was probably time for the markets to pause for breath and that certainly appears to have come about during today\u2019s session. Oil prices are edging back a little, but more significantly for London stocks was the news that UK retail sales came in far lower than had been forecast. This seems to have set the pace for the morning session and the fact that Mario Draghi appeared to lack any urgency in his statement meant there was little left for markets to cheer, although we have seen some signs of bargain hunting in the last few minutes of trade. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell 28.82 points or 0.45% to 6381.44 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.14% to 10,435.73 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.2% lower at 4582.83 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished up 0.4% at 18,732.96 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.55% at 9197.2 In Greece, the Athens market added 2.78% to 598.72 on hopes of a deal between the country and its creditors as the Eurogroup meets on Friday On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 58 points or 0.3%. In his opening remarks to Anglo American\u2019s annual meeting - just released by the company - chairman Sir John Parker has defended its pay policies: We are of course well aware of the strength of feeling among some investors about the levels of executive remuneration in many large companies and the mechanisms that determine them. As you know, we undertook extensive revisions to our remuneration policy in 2013 following consultations by the chair of our Remuneration Committee, Sir Philip Hampton, with our major shareholders, and that policy was overwhelmingly approved at our AGM in 2014. It is that policy that we are working to today. Volatile commodity markets and their effect on companies such as ours of course create a variety of remuneration outcomes. That is what our remuneration structures are designed for - to ensure appropriate alignment with shareholder interests, while also incentivising management through a balance between stretching management and making targets realistically achievable. There has to be a mixture of measures focused on financial and relative market performance as well as non-financial metrics for other critical work that drives longer-term strategic success. I believe that our remuneration policy does strike that balance. However, as is the case every three years, we will be taking a fresh look at the policy during the next 12 months in order to put it to a fresh round of consultation with shareholders, followed by a vote at next year\u2019s AGM. In the case of the remuneration outcomes for 2015 - without doubt a very tough year for us and for our shareholders - I would point out that our existing policy did result in the Chief Executive\u2019s variable pay being just one-fifth of the maximum achievable. In addition, his salary was frozen, as it was for all senior management. Anglo American plans to launch a review of executive pay, Reuters is reporting, after the revolt against the \u00a33.4m pay packet awarded to chief executive Mark Cutifani. The exact numbers show 41.64% of shareholders who submitted votes ahead of the annual meeting opposed the remuneration report. Last year 94% voted in favour of the report. The vote is, as usual, non-binding but will prove severely embarrassing for the company. Anglo says the full voting result will be released on Friday. Of those shareholders who submitted votes ahead of the annual meeting, 41% were opposed to the remuneration report with 58% in favour. Earlier investment group Hermes said it would not back the pay report. Director Bruce Duguid said: We are concerned by the unusually high number of shares issued to directors under its long term incentive plan. This is roughly triple the number of prior years, as it is calculated by dividing the salary of each director by the prevailing share price, which was particularly low at the time of the award following a sharp fall over the year. In the light of the value creation experienced by long term owners in recent years, we are concerned about the resulting potential future reward to directors. Elsewhere, the new \u201cshareholder spring\u201d seems to be continuing. After nearly 60% of investors voted against Bob Dudley\u2019s pay package at BP, Reuters is reporting that Anglo American has said that partial voting results show that 41% of shareholders have voted against its remuneration report at the mining group\u2019s annual meeting. Chief executive Mark Cutifani is in line for a \u00a33.4m pay deal. Earlier, just as ECB president Mario Draghi was getting started, over in the US the Labor Department announced that the number of jobless claims fell unexpectedly last week. Initial benefit claims dropped by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 247,000, the lowest reading since November 1973, compared to expectations of a rise to around 263,000. Meanwhile oil is on the slide again. After early gains, a rebound in the value of the dollar has seen Brent crude fall 1.5% to $45.08 a barrel. Back with the UK, and the Treasury has revealed the impact of falling oil prices on the North Sea sector. Scotland editor Severin Carrell reports: The North Sea oil and gas sector raised only \u00a335m last year following the collapse in global oil prices and further weakening the Treasury\u2019s books, the latest HMRC data shows. Provisional HMRC data for 2015/16 puts total petroleum revenue tax income at minus \u00a3503m \u2013 the first time PRT income has been negative for a full year, with operators able to deduct various allowances or a deductible expense for corporation tax and the supplementary charge. In 2008/09, the Treasury raised \u00a32.8bn from PRT. Offshore corporation tax income was also at its lowest in decades, at \u00a3538m compared to peaks of \u00a39.8bn in 2008/09 and \u00a38.8bn in 2011/12. These figures, which exclude Treasury income from the supplementary charge or costs to the Treasury of other North Sea tax deductions or allowances for decommissioning or investment, suggest the sector\u2019s days as a cash cow are now over. It also confirms challenging questions for Scotland in the ongoing debate over independence. Still with the eurozone, and consumer confidence rose slightly more than expected in April after three consecutive months of decline. According to an initial estimate from the European Commission, it edged up 0.4 points to -9.3 compared to expectations of a figure of -9.5. For the 28 member European Union, consumer sentiment increased by 0.5 points to -6.8. Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight said: A modicum of good news for Eurozone growth hopes as consumer confidence edged up in April having fallen over the previous three months to be at a 15-month low in March. The improvement was small, but at least it was a tiny step in the right direction. Any sign that consumer confidence may be starting to turn around is to be welcomed as on the face of it, consumers perhaps offer the Eurozone the best hope for growth at the moment - the fundamentals still look reasonable for consumer spending in the Eurozone with deflation/negligible inflation boosting purchasing power and labour markets generally improved. Commenting on the criticism of loose monetary policies from some quarters - notably Germany of course - economists at the Cebr said: Cebr recognises that there are important risks associated with an over-reliance on loose monetary policy. Continuing to push on the string of monetary policy to boost the Eurozone\u2019s flailing economy is not a sustainable way forward. The potential of monetary stimulus to restore inflation and growth is reaching its limits as more decisive measures such as \u2018helicopter money\u2019 are not yet on the ECB table. Moreover, the uncharted waters of \u201cQE infinity\u201d and negative rates could be hiding unintended negative consequences that no one can predict \u2013 the policies are after all called \u2018unconventional\u2019 for a reason. However, as Draghi pointed out in his press conference, the ECB is not alone in experimenting with these measures. On the contrary, the ECB has been late to the \u2018QE party\u2019 and in efforts to loosen policy more generally. Additionally, given its mandate to pursue price stability and contribute to the EU\u2019s objective of balanced economic growth, the ECB cannot be blamed for loosening policy given the inadequate response when it comes to the other levers of economic management: fiscal policy and structural reforms. Looking ahead, Cebr expects the economic recovery in the Eurozone to continue to develop at an anaemic pace. While the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures will provide some relief for now, these policies will only work slowly in the absence of a supportive fiscal stance in those member states that can afford to do so within the Maastricht Treaty\u2019s fiscal rules. The ECB meeting was clearly dovish in tone, according to economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank: Some ECB watchers today might regret that they did not enjoy one of the first sunny days of the year but stayed inside following a rather eventless, not to say dull, ECB press conference. As expected the ECB did not announce any new measures but sent a clear dovish signal, keeping the door open for additional easing in the future. All in all, there are two key take-aways from today\u2019s ECB meeting: first of all, the ECB is still on high alert and would be willing to implement even more stimulus if the recovery falters or low inflation leads to negative second round effects (even though it\u2019s unclear what these measures would really be). And, secondly, the ECB does not look willing at all to alter its monetary policies as a result of German criticism. German [criticism] has become a fact of life but it will not change the ECB\u2019s life. Following Draghi\u2019s performance, the ECB has issued more details of its corporate bond buying programme. This will start in June and be carried out by six central banks, from Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Finland. Among the criteria for eligibility, the bonds must be denominated in euro, have a credit rating of at least BBB-, have a maturity of between six months and 30 years, be issued by a corporation established in the euro area but not be a credit institution. Debt from corporations in the euro area whose ultimate parent companies are based elsewhere are also eligible if it meets the other criteria. Mario Draghi has just administered a very firm rebuke to his critics in general, and German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble in particular. Most crucially, the ECB president has warned that those who endanger ECB independence are actually making Europe\u2019s economic problems worse. He swept aside the notion that German savers are the victims in the current crisis, blaming the media for not explaining how low inflation is helping savers. And he was adamant that the ECB will not be knocked off course, revealing that the governing council were unanimous in defending its independence today. As Draghi put it: We have a mandate to pursue price stability for the whole of the euro zone not only for Germany. We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent as stated by the law.\u201d That\u2019s code for \u201cWolfgang, please don\u2019t claim we are causing \u2018enormous problems\u2019, there\u2019s a good chap\u201d. Draghi also tried to cool another discussion, about helicopter money, saying twice that it hadn\u2019t been discussed. And having left interest rates on hold today, Draghi\u2019s message to the eurozone was effectively \u2018trust us, it\u2019s working\u2019. Our policies work, they are effective. Just give them time to fully display their effects.\u201d And finally, Draghi gets the Brexit question. Q: Is the ECB worried that the UK\u2019s referendum over European Union membership will hurt the recovery? The discussion about Brexit has already had some significant consequences on markets, Draghi replies, such as the decline in the value of sterling. He won\u2019t speculate about the outcome of the vote on June 23, but says that ECB staff think there is only a \u201climited\u201d risk that it might endanger the eurozone recovery. Q: Are you worried that companies will stop investing because of the flow of criticism from Germany? A polite, lively debate may even be welcome, to help shape our policies, says Draghi. But criticisms of a certain type could be seen as endangering the independence of the ECB. Therefore, that can cause delays in investment, delays in taking risks. But we are independent, so we will continue with our policies. But the recovery will take longer if our independence is endangered, he concludes. Q: How are relations with Wolfgang Schauble, and do you accept his claim that the ECB has fuelled support for extremist parties in Germany? My discussions with Schauble have been very positive, fruitful.... and \u201cI would say quiet, and very friendly\u201d Draghi replies. And he rejects the claim that a non-Italian would be acting differently. His predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, recently said he would have taken exactly the same steps. Q: German citizens are seriously worried about their private pension schemes, as the yield on government bonds are so low. Did you discuss this, and what do you say to Germans? Yeah, we are familiar with these concerns, and we are watching it, Draghi replies briskly. It\u2019s evident that pension funds and insurance companies are challenged by low interest rates. And Draghi then takes another jab at his critics... By the way, I would urge all the actors in this sector to blame low interest rates for the cause of everything that has gone wrong in this sector. The US had low interest rate for much longer than Europe, he adds, without the same problems as in Europe. And real interest rates (adjusted for inflation) have been lower in the past. Explaining real rates to savers may be difficult... that\u2019s your job, I suggest, he concludes. Another slap to his German critics. Draghi is in a snappy mood today, repeating that the ECB\u2019s measures have supported growth in the eurozone. Indeed, they have been the only policy to support growth in the last four years (with rare exceptions). That\u2019s a second slap at Germany! But for sustainable growth, Europe also needs structural reforms and an appropriately supportive fiscal policies. That means growth-friendly government policies, including lower taxes, lower public expenditure, and more investment, Draghi insists. Q: Last month you suggests interest rates are unlikely to fall again. Has that position changed? Draghi says that the experience with negative interest rates has been largely positive so far. They haven\u2019t hurt banks\u2019 income, and they hasn\u2019t been a pass-through to customers. But the ECB is also awake to the added complexity that negative rates brings. Q: How concerned are you about the recent rise in the euro? As I\u2019ve said many times, the exchange rate is not a policy target, although it\u2019s an important factor in growth and inflation, Draghi says, The measures we took in March will be effective in avoiding \u2018second round effects\u2019 (pushing inflation rates even lower) Q: Are there any circumstances under which the ECB could consider helicopter money? Is it legal under EU law? We didn\u2019t discuss it, Draghi repeats firmly. Draghi then cites research showing that Eurozone GDP would be 1.6% lower if the ECB had not launched its stimulus measures. Inflation would be lower too. Mario Draghi has just robustly defended the ECB against critics of its stimulus packages. Q: Is Draghi concerned about criticism from German politicians* over its monetary policy? We have a mandate to implement monetary stability across the eurozone, not just Germany, Draghi replies, declaring: We obey the law, not the politicians, because we are independent. He then reveals that the ECB\u2019s governing council discussed this issue today, and was unanimous in defending the independence of the ECB. Our politicie work, they are effective, just give them time to work, Draghi adds. And they would work faster if European politicians implemented structural reforms. * - this month, Germany\u2019s finance minister accused the ECB of fuelling the rise of euro-sceptic parties in Germany. Q: Has the ECB considered helicopter money this month? Draghi repeats his statement from last month (that helicopter money is an interesting idea that economists are looking at). We have not talked about it, he insists. Onto questions... Q: Can you give more details about the corporate bond-buying programme announced last month? Draghi says that all non-banks are eligible, including the parent companies of firms which own banks. Good summary: Draghi then give his own trumpet a little toot, saying the measures put in place since June 2014 have clearly helped the eurozone economy: And the ECB president concludes with his traditional call for eurozone governments to take structural reforms now, and implement the eurozone\u2019s stability pact. All countries should strive for a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies, he adds. Draghi says this every month, and it\u2019s not clear that European politicians are really paying attention: Sounding suitably cautious, Draghi says that the risks to Eurozone growth remain \u201ctilted to the downside\u201d. Inflation could turn negative again in the coming months, and uncertainties in the global economy are also holding back growth. But the ECB is still confident that inflation will then rise back toward the ECB\u2019s target. And he cites surveys showing that demand for bank lending is picking up. Draghi adds that it is essential to preserve \u201can appropriate degree of monetary accommodation\u201d for as long as needed. That\u2019s another hint that the ECB has more tools, if needed. Draghi says that broad financing conditions in the euro area have improved since the ECB announce its \u201ccomprehensive package of decisions taken in early March\u201d. Mario Draghi begins with a prepared statement as usual. He confirms that the ECB left interest rates unchanged, and immediately drops a hint that further cuts are possible! Draghi says: We continue to expect them [interest rates] to remain at present, or lower, levels for an extended period of time - and well past the horizon of asset purchases. Mario Draghi and colleagues have arrived, a few minutes late..... (when last happened, it emerged that they\u2019d got stuck in a lift!). Here\u2019s a live feed of Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, which starts in 5 minutes. I\u2019ve tried to embed it at the top of the blog too, so you might need to refresh this page. The sudden rise in the euro is a little curious, as every economist had expected the ECB to leave rates on hold. The euro is strengthening against the US dollar, now up 0.5% at $1.135 (from $1.130 this morning). That won\u2019t please Mario Draghi too much. Perhaps he\u2019ll manage to talk it down.... Nancy Curtin, Chief Investment Officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, says that the eurozone economy looks a bit less troubled than six weeks ago, at the last ECB meeting. \u201cAfter Draghi brought out the big guns last month, he was never realistically going to up the ante further on monetary easing in April. The modest recovery in the Eurozone\u2019s economic fortunes placed the ECB on somewhat firmer footing ahead of the decision. Lending conditions have improved in the bloc, business confidence seems to be climbing, and unemployment is falling. That\u2019s not to say the recovery is entrenched by any means. Deflationary pressures remain prominent, the euro has been strengthening, and the impact of the forthcoming EU referendum in Britain will no doubt cause some uncertainty. \u201cThe door is certainly not closed for further monetary stimulus, but given market scepticism about its long-term efficacy, it\u2019s likely Draghi will keep any further measures back for moments of future turmoil.\u201d Reminder: At the last ECB meeting, Mario Draghi and colleagues threw the kitchen sink at the eurozone\u2019s struggling economy. They slashed interest rates to zero, hit banks with deeper negative rates but also offered them free loans, boosted their bond-buying programme to \u20ac80bn/month, and started buying corporate debt. Today\u2019s meeting couldn\u2019t match that for drama, but we\u2019re going to hear more details of the plan. We\u2019re also expecting questions about opposition to the ECB\u2019s plan from some German politicians, and about the idea that central banks could be forced to monetise government debt or hand free money to citizens (helicopter money). With rates on hold, we now wait for Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, in around 40 minutes (1.30pm BST or 2.30pm in Frankfurt). The ECB says that Draghi will give more details about the stimulus measures he announced last month: Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we have started to expand our monthly purchases under the asset purchase programme to \u20ac80 billion. The focus is now on the implementation of the additional non-standard measures decided on 10 March 2016. Further information on the implementation aspects of the corporate sector purchase programme will be released after the press conference on the ECB\u2019s website. Here we go! The European Central bank has left interest rates unchanged. That means: the headline interest rate across the eurozone stays at zero, a record low. The deposit rate (for commercial bank deposits at the ECB) remains at minus -0.4%. That means banks will still be penalised for leaving money in Draghi\u2019s vaults. The marginal lending facility (which banks pay to borrow from the ECB) remains at +0.25%. And the ECB has also left its bond-buying programme unchanged, at \u20ac80bn per month. Two minutes to go until the European Central Bank decision! Just enough time to flag up this useful chart showing which ECB policymakers have been pushing for more monetary easing (the doves), and which are less convinced (hawks) Sweden\u2019s central bank has highlighted the weakness of Europe\u2019s economy, by boosting its stimulus package. But the move has also shown the limitations of monetary policy to move the markets. The Riksbank has announced it will boost its government bond-buying programme from 200bn Swedish krona to 245bn. That is designed to pump more money into the economy, and prevent the krona strengthening further against the euro. However, the markets didn\u2019t take the hint -- the krona actually strengthened immediately after the announcement. One for older readers:  Economist Sean Richards has written more about the Riksbank move, and the limits of central bankers, here: Will central banks forever cry \u201cTo Infinity! And Beyond!\u201d Europe\u2019s weak recovery, despite the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy, is one key reason why the region is being \u201cstretched to the limit\u201d, says the Economist Intelligence Unit in a new report. The EIU fears that Europe could be driven into heightened crisis this year, by problems such as migration, Britain\u2019s EU referendum, and Greece\u2019s debt woes. And the biggest risk facing Europe, according to the EIU, is that multiple challenges will come to a head simultaneously, overwhelming the region\u2019s policymakers. This could happen as soon as mid-2016, when the UK votes on whether or not to remain in the EU, Greece has large debt payments falling due and this year\u2019s migrant influx is likely to peak. Here are the seven separate problems that could scupper Europe\u2019s hopes of \u2018muddling through\u2019: Migration: The migration crisis touches on crucial issues of sovereignty, culture, borders and free movement. Europe\u2019s confused response so far has risked worsening the problem, although there are tentative signs that the recent EU-Turkey deal has slowed migrant flows. Brexit: The risks of the UK leaving the EU have increased over recent weeks\u2014chiefly because of a series of hits to the reputation for competence of the prime minister, David Cameron\u2014but we continue to expect the UK to vote \u201cremain\u201d in June. Grexit: We expect Greece to leave the euro zone during our five-year forecast period. Grexit would represent a huge political failure for the bloc, with potentially destabilising consequences: the principle of irreversibility would have been shattered. Monetary policy: A deepening reliance on accommodative monetary policy has been one of the hallmarks of the post-crisis period in Europe. This is creating its own challenges which the region is hard placed to address. Productivity: The region faces an ongoing crisis of productivity which it needs to address if it is to deliver improved growth. Regional security: Russia has become aggressively revisionist in the last several years, posing a challenge to the regional security architecture. Populism: Populist movements have come to prominence in rich and poor countries alike, and the region will struggle to manage the implications of an erosion of post-war political structures and voting patterns. Aengus Collins, Country Forecast Director at The Economist Intelligence Unit, warns that politicians are failing to tackle these crisis: \u201cPolicymakers appear increasingly unable to understand and respond to the desires of their electorates. This is leading to voting patterns that could have lasting destabilising effects. Nowhere are people more jittery about electoral risk right now than in the UK. We\u2019re sticking with our years-old forecast that in June the UK will vote to remain in the EU\u2014the pull of the status quo will strengthen as the vote draws closer and the risks of Brexit crystallise\u2014but all the momentum has been with the \u201cleave\u201d campaign in recent weeks and nothing can be taken for granted.\u201d And on monetary policy, the EIU warns: The idea that the ECB can boost the euro zone singlehandedly bumped up against the law of diminishing returns some time ago. In every speech he makes Mr Draghi exhorts the euro zone\u2019s political leaders to do more to promote growth in their economies. There is little evidence that they take these exhortations seriously.... The full report is online here: Europe stretched to the limit One hour to wait until the European Central Bank announces its decision on monetary policy, followed by a press conference at 1.30pm BST. City analyst Arjun Lakhanpal says Mario Draghi will try to reassure investors that his latest stimulus measures will work, and that further action is possible: John McDonnell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, says chancellor Osborne must take the blame for missing the UK\u2019s borrowing targets in the last financial year: \u201cThe latest figures for public sector borrowing show George Osborne is on course to miss his only remaining target for the economy, with the Tory Government\u2019s deficit significantly higher than forecast. Government debt is rising even as unemployment increases and exports slump. \u201cThis is a record of further failure from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. His recovery is built on sand and his unaffordable and counterproductive fiscal targets mean that failures will continue. Labour\u2019s Fiscal Credibility Rule would set a realistic target to get rid of the deficit on day-to-day spending whilst allowing government the capacity to invest in the high-tech, high-wage economy of the future.\u201d The London stock markets has fallen into the red following the public finance figures, and the fall in UK retail sales. The FTSE 100 is down 50 points, or 0.8%, at 6360. Media group Sky is leading the fallers after reporting slowing customer growth numbers this morning. Conner Campbell of trading firm SpreadEx says: A double dose of dismal data was responsible for the index\u2019s slide, with retail sales plunging to -1.3% (nearing those post-Christmas lows) and the UK\u2019s borrowing figures overshooting George Osborne\u2019s targets by \u00a32 billion (to \u00a374 billion) for the 2015/16 financial year. This chart puts the retail sales fall in context: Britain\u2019s Debt Management Office has announced it will sell an extra \u00a32.1bn of government debt, to cover the shortfall in the public finances. George Osborne\u2019s second term as chancellor hasn\u2019t got off to a good start, says Ross Campbell, director for public sector policy at The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales: \u201cWithin the first year of new Parliament, Chancellor George Osborne has missed his deficit target by \u00a31.8bn. It was always apparent that there was very little margin for error and that any small change in assumptions for public expenditure plans would make it difficult to hit the Chancellor\u2019s \u00a372.2bn deficit target. Unless the UK economy, against the backdrop of a global economy that is unwilling to help the Chancellor dig himself out of out of his fiscal hole, improves somehow, it looks like the notion of returning to surplus by 2020 is highly improbable.\u201d Here\u2019s the official Treasury response to today\u2019s borrowing figures: Today\u2019s figures confirm that the record post-war deficit we inherited has been cut by almost two thirds as a share of GDP. \u201cWe are borrowing \u00a318 billion less than last year and March\u2019s monthly borrowing was the lowest for a decade. \u201cBut while the deficit is falling, the job of repairing the public finances is not done and the Budget set out action to ensure that debt falls in 2016-17 and Britain is back in the black by the end of this parliament.\u201d Economists are warning that Britain\u2019s public finances could be facing further problems. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics points out that today\u2019s borrowing figures don\u2019t show the impact of the recent economic slowdown. The risk of a much bigger overshoot this year has grown as the economy has slowed. With the fiscal projections also resting on optimistic assumptions for revenues from tax avoidance measures and savings from the welfare budget, we continue to think that the Chancellor will have to implement even more austerity than planned to achieve a budget surplus by 2020. Nina Skero of the Centre for Economics and Business Research agrees that George Osborne is unlikely to meet his goal of eliminating the deficit. With income tax thresholds set to rise over the remainder of this parliament, not only does the government face restrictions on cutting spending, but also on generating revenue. Therefore, it is very likely that within a couple of years the Chancellor will be faced with the unenviable task of deciding between cutting long-term investment spending or giving up on the self-imposed goal of eliminating the deficit by 2020. As cutting long-term investment spending eventually results in lower economic growth, Cebr believes that in this situation the Chancellor would be forced to abandon or postpone his deficit-eliminating ambitions. We expect a deficit of just over \u00a330 billion in 2020. Today\u2019s public finance figures could have been worse for the chancellor, argues Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global insight. George Osborne will be open to criticism as he missed the 2015/16 public finances targets that were set out as recently as March\u2019s budget \u2013 but he will probably be pretty relieved that a much improved March performance meant that the miss was narrow. Furthermore, he can argue that the public finance data will be revised many times over the coming months so there is a realistic chance that the final figure will show that he achieved his targets. George Osborne has been dealt \u201cyet another blow\u201d by the news that Britain borrowed almost \u00a32bn more than targeted last year, says Peter Spence of the Daily Telegraph. It\u2019s particularly awkward for the chancellor, as he read out the lower target to the House of Commons just last month. Peter explains: Revealing the OBR\u2019s forecast at the Budget in March, the Chancellor announced that the Government expected to borrow \u00a372.2bn in the fiscal year. However, it quickly became apparent that the UK would have to borrow more than planned. A week after the new targets were made public, ONS figures showed that the public sector had borrowed \u00a370.7bn in the first 11 months of the financial year, leaving Mr Osborne with just \u00a31.5bn to play with in March - a number he has failed to meet, barring a drastic revision of the figures at a later date. Britain borrowed more than expected in the last financial year, in another blow to George Osborne\u2019s attempts to eliminate the deficit. The UK borrowed almost \u00a374bn to balance the books in the 2015-16 financial year, according to new figures. That\u2019s almost \u00a32bn more than the official forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility in last month\u2019s budget. It\u2019s an embarrassment for George Osborne, and underlines how hard it will be to eliminate the deficit this parliament (as he is aiming to). The UK deficit is still coming down.; \u00a374bn is around \u00a317bn less than was borrowed in the previous 12 months. But the total national debt has now hit \u00a31,594.1 billion, equivalent to 83.5% of Gross Domestic Product. Discouraging news from the UK high street. British retail sales slumped by 1.3% in March, much worse than expectations of a 0.1% decline. On an annual basis, retail sales were 2.7% higher than in March 2015. But average store prices fell by 3.0% in March 2016 - the 21st consecutive month of year-on-year price falls. Most Asian markets have closed higher, although China dipped into the red: Today\u2019s ECB press conference is unlikely to be as dramatic at last year\u2019s \u2018Glitter Bombing\u2019, when protester Josephine Witt jumped on Draghi\u2019s desk before being carried out. Instead, Marc Ostwald of ADM Investors services expects plenty of questions about the effectiveness of the ECB\u2019s policies, the health of the banking sector, and the rift with Germany. Two weeks ago, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble made an astonishing attack on Draghi \u2013 blaming the ECB for the rise of the eurosceptic Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party. As Sch\u00e4uble put it: \u201cI told Mario Draghi \u2026 you can be very proud [of AfD\u2019s rise].\u201d Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s remarks pushed the boundaries of central bank independence (if not hurdling them altogether). And it\u2019s notable that Germany\u2019s man at the ECB, Jens Weidmann, rebuked Draghi\u2019s critics last week. So Draghi is going to be quizzed about this issue today.... Mario Draghi could surprise the markets today by hinting at future interest rates cuts if growth and inflation don\u2019t pick up. So suggests Frederik Ducrozet, senior economist at Banque Pictet, the Swiss private bank. That would require a u-turn from Draghi, who suggested last month that rates were unlikely to go lower. That sent the euro soaring \u2013 which won\u2019t have pleased the ECB. Ducrozet, the only economist to predict last month\u2019s wide-ranging stimulus measures, also told Bloomberg TV that Draghi shouldn\u2019t be worried by criticism from Germany. It\u2019s good news that Germany is concerned, Ducrozet argues, as it shows that the ECB is setting monetary policy for the eurozone as a whole (rather than trying to placate its largest member). If Germany were happy, that would be bad as it would mean the ECB were setting a two-tiered policy. Ducrezet adds that Mario Draghi should aim to be calm and confident at today\u2019s press conference, and reassure investors that his plans are working. I\u2019m not saying he will have an easy ride, but he should stick with his own message\u2026. no stress, and be very proud Mr Draghi. To see the concerns within Germany over the ECB\u2019s ultra-loose monetary policy, just check the Bild tabloid today. It asks: \u201cVerbrennt Draghi unser Geld?\u201d, or \u201cIs Draghi burning our money?\u201d, by cutting headline interest rates to zero and hitting banks with negative interest rates. Bild\u2019s complaint is that savers get virtually no return on their cash: Savers are paying the bill. Draghi (nicknamed Super Mario) is burning their hard-saved cash! However, the usual counterfactual applies \u2013 how much trouble would we be in if central banks had NOT eased monetary policy, or more banks had been allowed to fail? European stock markets have mostly opened higher this morning, although many investors are sitting tight until they hear from Mario Draghi. Mario Draghi will face questions today about the impact of negative interest, and the idea that central banks could be forced to drop money from the skies to get inflation up. So predicts Mark Haefele, global CIO at UBS Wealth Management. Writing on CNBC, he says: We expect no action from the European Central Bank (ECB) when it meets this Thursday. However, we do think investors should pay close attention to ECB President Draghi\u2019s words at the post-decision press conference. He is likely to respond to three key questions that many in the markets, including us, would like answered. First, are current policy measures like negative interest rates doing more harm than good? Second, are more out-of-the-box policy options like \u201chelicopter money\u201d in discussion? Third, what is the ECB\u2019s early take on longer-term growth and inflation? Helicopter money is the idea that central banks releases money directly to the private sector. Last month, Draghi described it as a \u201cvery interesting concept\u201d which the ECB \u201chaven\u2019t really studied yet\u201d -- hardly a rejection of the whole idea. Helicopter money would be unpopular with the ECB\u2019s existing critics, but might reassure investors who fear Dragh is running out of weapons, says Haefele. And on negative interest rates, Haefele adds: Markets want answers to the charge that sub-zero rates are doing more harm than good, squeezing bank profits rather than spurring them to lend. .... If markets are reassured that the ECB will only lower deposit rates further in the event of a deflationary shock, Eurozone banks shares may recoup some of their near 20 percent year-to-date losses and regain some of their confidence to lend. More here: Here\u2019s what to watch on ECB decision day Stock markets across Asia have risen as investors wait to hear from Mario Draghi today. Japan\u2019s Nikkei led the charge, closing up 457 points or 2.7%. Australia jumped by 1% and Hong Kong has gained 1.7%. This sent Asian markets to the highest levels in almost six months. Lingering hopes that oil producers might (eventually) agree some kind of production freeze also pushed up shares, traders said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s ECB Day again. Over in Frankfurt, the governing council of the European Central Bank is gathering to set monetary policy across the eurozone. We\u2019re not expecting any new stimulus measures today. It\u2019s only six weeks since ECB chief Mario Draghi slashed interest rates and also boosted the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. So Draghi could find himself fending off criticism from German politicians, including finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, for hurting savers with record low interest rates. There will be interest in what Draghi says about the battle against deflation, the latest deadlock between Greece and its creditors, and perhaps even domestic issues such as the rise of populist parties in Europe and Britain\u2019s EU referendum. Speaking of Britain, we get the latest UK retail sales and public finance figures this morning. After yesterday\u2019s rise in unemployment, economists will be looking for further signs that growth is slowing down. We\u2019ll also have an eye on Greece\u2019s bailout talks, and the scandal around Japanese carmaker Mitsubishi which admitted faking fuel efficiency tests. Volkswagen was not alone....

As you know, we undertook extensive revisions to our remuneration policy in 2013 following consultations by the chair of our Remuneration Committee, Sir Philip Hampton, with our major shareholders, and that policy was overwhelmingly approved at our AGM in 2014. It is that policy that we are working to today.</p> <p> Volatile commodity markets and their effect on companies such as ours of course create a variety of remuneration outcomes. That is what our remuneration structures are designed for - to ensure appropriate alignment with shareholder interests, while also incentivising management through a balance between stretching management and making targets realistically achievable.</p> <p> There has to be a mixture of measures focused on financial and relative market performance as well as non-financial metrics for other critical work that drives longer-term strategic success. I believe that our remuneration policy does strike that balance. However, as is the case every three years, we will be taking a fresh look at the policy during the next 12 months in order to put it to a fresh round of consultation with shareholders, followed by a vote at next year\u2019s AGM.</p> <p> In the case of the remuneration outcomes for 2015 - without doubt a very tough year for us and for our shareholders - I would point out that our existing policy did result in the Chief Executive\u2019s variable pay being just one-fifth of the maximum achievable.

Continuing to push on the string of monetary policy to boost the Eurozone\u2019s flailing economy is not a sustainable way forward. The potential of monetary stimulus to restore inflation and growth is reaching its limits as more decisive measures such as \u2018helicopter money\u2019 are not yet on the ECB table. Moreover, the uncharted waters of \u201cQE infinity\u201d and negative rates could be hiding unintended negative consequences that no one can predict \u2013 the policies are after all called \u2018unconventional\u2019 for a reason. However, as Draghi pointed out in his press conference, the ECB is not alone in experimenting with these measures. On the contrary, the ECB has been late to the \u2018QE party\u2019 and in efforts to loosen policy more generally. Additionally, given its mandate to pursue price stability and contribute to the EU\u2019s objective of balanced economic growth, the ECB cannot be blamed for loosening policy given the inadequate response when it comes to the other levers of economic management: fiscal policy and structural reforms. </p> <p>Looking ahead, Cebr expects the economic recovery in the Eurozone to continue to develop at an anaemic pace. While the ECB\u2019s stimulus measures will provide some relief for now, these policies will only work slowly in the absence of a supportive fiscal stance in those member states that can afford to do so within the Maastricht Treaty\u2019s fiscal rules.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5718dfc4e4b0e8c8aac09fa2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-21T14:15:25.693Z\">3.15pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The ECB meeting was clearly dovish in tone, according to economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Some ECB watchers today might regret that they did not enjoy one of the first sunny days of the year but stayed inside following a rather eventless, not to say dull, ECB press conference. As expected the ECB did not announce any new measures but sent a clear dovish signal, keeping the door open for additional easing in the future.</p> <p>All in all, there are two key take-aways from today\u2019s ECB meeting: first of all, the ECB is still on high alert and would be willing to implement even more stimulus if the recovery falters or low inflation leads to negative second round effects (even though it\u2019s unclear what these measures would really be). And, secondly, the ECB does not look willing at all to alter its monetary policies as a result of German criticism. German [criticism] has become a fact of life but it will not change the ECB\u2019s life.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5718dcefe4b01f52551dab6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-04-21T14:06:01.592Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Following Draghi\u2019s performance, the ECB has issued <strong><a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2016/html/pr160421_1.en.html\">more details of its corporate bond buying programme.</a></strong></p> <p>This will start in June and be carried out by six central banks, from Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy and Finland.</p> <p>Among the criteria for eligibility, the bonds must be denominated in euro, have a credit rating of at least BBB-, have a maturity of between six months and 30 years, be issued by a corporation established in the euro area but not be a credit institution.

Europe\u2019s confused response so far has risked worsening the problem, although there are tentative signs that the recent EU-Turkey deal has slowed migrant flows.<br></li> <li><strong>Brexit</strong>: The risks of the UK leaving the EU have increased over recent weeks\u2014chiefly because of a series of hits to the reputation for competence of the prime minister, David Cameron\u2014but we continue to expect the UK to vote \u201cremain\u201d in June.<br></li> <li><strong>Grexit</strong>: We expect Greece to leave the euro zone during our five-year forecast period. Grexit would represent a huge political failure for the bloc, with potentially destabilising consequences: the principle of irreversibility would have been shattered. <br></li> <li><strong>Monetary policy</strong>: A deepening reliance on accommodative monetary policy has been one of the hallmarks of the post-crisis period in Europe.

So let\u2019s start with the obvious. There has been no Damascene conversion to the need for a more interventionist industrial strategy. This is not the start of a rolling back of the privatisations undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s. David Cameron has not morphed into Ted Heath, the last Tory prime minister to embrace state ownership. What\u2019s happened is that the government found itself in a dirty great hole, partly but not entirely owing to its own failings. Ministers were asleep at the wheel as the steel industry found itself struggling to cope with cheap Chinese imports, and did their best to thwart European attempts to mount an aggressive anti-dumping action against Beijing. They also delayed too long in taking steps that might have mitigated the financial losses faced by Tata: lower business rates and reductions in energy bills. Still, it is amazing how a looming, knife-edge referendum on EU membership concentrates the mind. The government was faced with a situation where the loss of thousands of steel jobs would be blamed either on Westminster or Brussels, and most likely both. So a decision has been taken that steel must be saved. No matter how it came to be made, the commitment to provide hundreds of millions of pounds in debt financing or an equity stake of up to 25% in order to keep the plants operating is the right one. It would have been bizarre to allow the steel industry to die at a time when the government has plans to invest more in major infrastructure projects. Instead, ministers have accepted that steel is a strategically important part of the economy and, by putting taxpayers\u2019 money at risk, will now have an incentive to tackle Chinese dumping. There is the risk that the decision by the business secretary, Savid Javid, will fall foul of EU state-aid rules. The view from Brussels in recent years is that there is over-capacity in the European steel sector and that support from EU governments should be reduced rather than increased. But is Brussels really going to kibosh the government\u2019s rescue plan if the consequence is that Europe gets the blame and the referendum is lost? It will see the bigger picture. Presumably.",

Ministers were asleep at the wheel as the steel industry found itself struggling to cope with cheap Chinese imports, and did their best to thwart European attempts to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/01/steel-crisis-uk-accused-blocking-eu-attempts-regulate-chinese-dumping\">mount an aggressive anti-dumping action against Beijing</a>.</p> <p>They also delayed too long in taking steps that might have mitigated the financial losses faced by Tata: lower business rates and reductions in energy bills.</p> <p>Still, it is amazing how a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/07/eu-referendum-everything-you-need-to-know\">looming, knife-edge referendum on EU membership</a> concentrates the mind. The government was faced with a situation where the loss of thousands of steel jobs would be blamed either on Westminster or Brussels, and most likely both.</p> <p>So a decision has been taken that steel must be saved. No matter how it came to be made, the commitment to provide hundreds of millions of pounds in debt financing or an equity stake of up to 25% in order to keep the plants operating is the right one.</p> <p>It would have been bizarre to allow the steel industry to die at a time when the government has plans to invest more in major infrastructure projects. Instead, ministers have accepted that steel is a strategically important part of the economy and, by putting taxpayers\u2019 money at risk, will now have an incentive to tackle Chinese dumping.</p> <p>There is the risk that the decision by the business secretary, Savid Javid, will fall foul of EU state-aid rules. The view from Brussels in recent years is that there is over-capacity in the European steel sector and that support from EU governments should be reduced rather than increased.</p> <p>But is Brussels really going to kibosh the government\u2019s rescue plan if the consequence is that Europe gets the blame and the referendum is lost? It will see the bigger picture. Presumably.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Luxury \u00a31.5m apartments being built in the Battersea power station redevelopment are being held back from the market, as the downturn at the top end of the London property market hits sales. Prices start at \u00a31.39m for a two-bedroom apartment designed by the architect Frank Gehry on the \u00a38bn site on the south bank of the Thames, while homes from Foster + Partners are marketed for \u00a31.55m and upwards. The chief executive of the Battersea Power Station Development company (BPSD), Rob Tincknell, told PropertyWeek that 35 apartments were currently up for sale, while another 150 were being held back. \u201cIf there is market demand, we will release more units, but the market has softened,\u201d he said. Tincknell added that his company was offering discounts to buyers but would not follow other London developers in doing heavily discounted bulk sales to institutional investors. \u201cThe market is quite challenging - there are fewer buyers around,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we have stopped - we are still selling apartments, but we\u2019re not chasing the market and we\u2019re not worried.\u201d BPSD, which is owned by Malaysian investors, said it had sold property worth \u00a3110m since November across the whole site. Properties are being released to buyers in tranches and since the third phase of marketing began in October 2014, 350 of the 539 apartments designed by Foster and Gehry have been sold. When the first phase of the property sale, 865 flats, went on the market three years ago, they all sold within weeks. About 20 luxury apartments out of 254 that were launched in the next phase two years ago have not been sold. This is the latest sign that potential buyers are being put off by recent stamp duty rises, while demand from wealthy foreign investors has slackened with the slowdown in China and mounting global economic uncertainty. There are also signs that Britain\u2019s potential exit from the EU is weighing on the property market. Several investment firms and banks have warned that a glut of luxury housing in London has created a bubble, with US bank Morgan Stanley predicting that the price of new upmarket flats could fall by 10-20% this year. UBS warned six months ago that house prices in London were the most overvalued of any major city in the world. Tincknell\u2019s comments came just days after BPSD unveiled its first Gehry show apartment, with the \u201cLA interior\u201d featuring rough sawn oak-fronted kitchen cabinets with open display shelves, while the \u201cLondon interior\u201d has chevron flooring and a metallic kitchen. The Canadian-born architect, who lives in Los Angeles, has designed a cluster of five buildings whose sculptural facades are inspired by London\u2019s John Nash regency terraces. They are reminiscent of the billowing sails of ships \u2013 echoing Gehry\u2019s ship design of the Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, northern Spain. A separate block designed by British architect Sir Norman Foster\u2019s firm has a 255-metre roof garden, which looks out on the Gehry buildings. The Foster apartments are styled in a 1930s theme that has been adopted from the power station. According to property website Propcision, a large number of the homes at Battersea power station that are being resold have had their asking prices slashed.",

    "webTitle": "Verizon earnings meet estimates as strike expected to hurt current quarter", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Verizon Communications said an ongoing strike by its wireline workers was expected to hurt earnings in the current quarter, even as it reported first-quarter net income that met analyst expectations amid strong tablet sales. Shares of Verizon, the No 1 US wireless carrier, were down 1.6% at $50.18 in morning trading on Thursday. If the strike, now in its second week, goes on for an extended period, it could pressure full-year earnings, the chief financial officer, Fran Shammo, said in an interview. The strike has caught national attention and union workers have attracted the support of Democrat presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019d like to settle this sooner than later,\u201d Shammo said. About 40,000 employees of Verizon\u2019s wireline business, which includes its Fios internet, telephone and TV services, went on strike after reaching an impasse in talks over a new labor contract. Issues include healthcare, offshoring of call center jobs, temporary job relocations and pensions. \u201cVerizon\u2019s first-quarter earnings show starkly how the company\u2019s misguided priorities and scattershot approach to business are hurting customers and the company\u2019s standing on Wall Street. Despite making $39bn profits over the last three years and $4.43bn in the first quarter of 2016 alone, the company is refusing to settle a fair contract and continues its efforts to offshore jobs to the Philippines, Mexico and other locations,\u201d said Anthony Finocchio, who walked off his job as a field technician nine days ago. Finocchio has been on strike with other Brooklyn-based Verizon workers. In the wireline business, Verizon\u2019s consumer revenue of $4bn was relatively unchanged from a year ago. Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.31bn, or $1.06 per share, in the first quarter, meeting analysts\u2019 expectations. A year earlier, net income was $4.22 bn, or $1.02 per share. The company stood by its full-year profit forecast. It said in January that 2016 adjusted earnings would be at a level comparable to 2015. Verizon has been scaling back its Fios TV and internet business, which represented about 29% of its 2015 revenue. To tap new revenue, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4bn. It is seen as the frontrunner in bidding for Yahoo Inc\u2019s core internet business. \u201cVerizon is trying to pivot its business from analog to digital,\u201d Craig Moffett, senior analyst at MoffettNathanson, a telecommunications-research firm, told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cVerizon believes that a combined AOL/Yahoo would provide the digital advertising platform they need to execute their video reinvention strategy.\u201d The striking workers are not thrilled with Verizon\u2019s plan to bid on Yahoo. \u201cRather than investing in good jobs here at home, Verizon refuses to make Fios available to thousands of people in towns and cities throughout the east coast and is embarking on a questionable path to acquire troubled Yahoo and other companies,\u201d Finocchio said on Thursday. \u201cThe value of the Yahoo deal alone would cover the cost to fulfill Verizon\u2019s commitment to New York and complete the Boston buildout with billions left over.\u201d The company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated US wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp has been offering half-off discounts, and T-Mobile US Inc has launched free music and video-streaming plans. Verizon reported strong subscriber net additions for the first quarter ended 31 March, adding 640,000 wireless retail postpaid subscribers, helped by tablet promotions during a seasonally slow period for phone upgrades. That surpassed analysts\u2019 average estimate of 480,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Customer defections, known as churn, in Verizon\u2019s wireless postpaid business, dropped to 0.96% from 1.03% a year earlier. Total operating revenue rose 0.6% to $32.17bn, falling slightly short of analysts\u2019 average estimate of $32.46bn, according to Reuters. Reuters contributed to this report.",

The hazards of forecasting even one month ahead have now been illustrated. At the time of the budget, the number crunchers at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said they expected the UK to have to borrow \u00a372.2bn to balance the books in 2015-16. The actual deficit turned out to be \u00a374bn. To be fair to the OBR, it did say at the time it expected the deficit to be revised down as more data became available. This is a reasonable assumption, given that in the past six financial years the deficit has eventually been reduced by an average of \u00a31.9bn. A repeat of that would leave the OBR\u2019s \u00a372.2bn forecast pretty much spot on. So let\u2019s give the OBR the benefit of the doubt about 2015-16. What are the prospects of it being right about the deficit coming down to \u00a355.5bn in 2016-17? The economy is clearly slowing, as illustrated by the falls in retail sales in both February and March, and by the small increase in the jobless total. The effects of the Brexit referendum are hard to assess. Firms are likely to delay investment decisions and consumers may also adopt a wait-and-see approach. But, assuming that the bookies are right and the referendum results in a decision to stay in the EU, there could then be a burst of catchup growth later in the year. As things stand, it may be tough for the government to meet its borrowing target for 2016-17. The slowdown in the economy, which will be reflected in next week\u2019s growth figures for the first quarter of 2016, is likely to mean lower tax receipts but only with a time lag. That suggests the coming months will greet the start of speculation about whether or not George Osborne will need to announce fresh spending cuts or tax increases to hit his target of running a budget surplus by 2019-20.",

    "webTitle": "Building industry blacklist whistleblower sues for victimisation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A whistleblower who helped expose how major firms blacklisted thousands of workers has launched legal action against more than 35 companies alleging that they are victimising him and denying him work. Alan Wainwright, a former construction industry manager, has accused the firms of refusing to fairly consider him for jobs because of his role in uncovering the unlawful blacklisting conspiracy. He has unsuccessfully applied for more than 150 jobs in the last 18 months. The 52-year-old, who lost his home, job and savings after blowing the whistle a decade ago, was himself placed on the blacklist after he spoke out about the practice. He said: \u201cThese new claims arise because the companies involved continue to victimise me. I should not have to go through all this again.\u201d His legal action against 38 companies has been started as another lawsuit, initiated by blacklisted workers, is scheduled to open in the high court on 9 May and last three months. The workers are suing 30 firms and four executives for compensation \u2013 which could total tens of millions of pounds \u2013 after they were denied jobs on construction sites, often for long periods of time. They had, for example, been categorised as troublemakers or had reported health and safety concerns. The firms being sued include Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Laing O\u2019Rourke and Sir Robert McAlpine. Around 500 of the 700 workers who started the legal action have secured damages ranging from \u00a325,000 to \u00a3200,000, in out of court settlements. A number of companies have already apologised to the workers for the anxiety and stress they caused. The clandestine blacklist \u2013 which contained files on at least 3,200 workers \u2013 began to be revealed in 2006 when Wainwright created a website publicising how it worked and the names of those who had been put on it. For more than a decade he had been a manager in the construction industry, involved in the recruiting of workers, when he had learned of the blacklist and been instructed to use it. At the time, he was told by his superiors not to discuss it with anyone as it was \u201cvery discreet, a closely guarded secret\u201d. Large construction firms had funded a clandestine operation \u2013 run out of an anonymous office in Droitwich, Worcestershire \u2013 in which names of prospective employees were checked against the files before they were hired. The files on the individual workers listed details of their trade union activities and employment history. Some were, for instance, labelled \u201cCommunist party\u201d, \u201clazy and a trouble-stirrer\u201d, and \u201cdo not touch\u201d. Those deemed to be unacceptable were refused work without knowing why. Sometimes information in the files was incorrect. Wainwright had quit a subsidiary of construction firm Balfour Beatty as he believed his superiors had covered up what he considered to be widespread fraud \u2013 a claim that has been denied by the subsidiary. He started to share information with electricians who he believed had been blacklisted. A report in the Guardian about the electricians\u2019 victory in an employment tribunal caught the attention of an official watchdog, the information commissioner, who started an investigation. In 2009, the information commissioner raided and closed down the operation, naming more than 40 construction firms who had covertly funded it, including Balfour Beatty, Sir Robert McAlpine, Laing O\u2019Rourke and Costain. Ian Kerr, who had run the operation under the prosaic name of the Consulting Association, was fined \u00a35,000 for a data protection offence. Wainwright later found out that in 2007 he had been placed on the blacklist which detailed his work to expose it. The file on him recorded how he had helped the blacklisted workers to win compensation at the employment tribunal for being unfairly dismissed. As he could no longer find work in the construction industry, he left the sector and got work reselling concert tickets for several years. Now he is using anti-blacklisting legislation to lodge 54 legal claims against companies and employment agencies after he sought in recent years to resume his career in the industry. In legal papers, he alleges for instance that he applied last year for a job as a labour manager with Balfour Beatty but was not given an interview. He had outlined his role in uncovering the blacklisting conspiracy in his application. Balfour Beatty said it had lodged a defence against Wainwright\u2019s claims, adding that it was \u201can equal opportunities employer. We ensure that all applicants receive equal treatment and that the criteria for employment are the same for everybody.\u201d Wainwright has also lodged a claim against Carillion as he says he was not given an interview for a human resources post. A Carillion spokesperson said: \u201cRecruitment for the role which Mr Wainwright applied for was suspended and he and all other applicants received a letter informing them of this. We would therefore deny any allegations of blacklisting and stress that Carillion does not carry out, nor approve of blacklisting. \u201cAll applications for roles are reviewed in a fair and transparent way against the role criteria and in line with our diversity and equality policy.\u201d Wainwright said he also did not get an interview when he applied for a job last year as a regional workforce manager with Laing O\u2019Rourke. A spokesperson for the firm confirmed that it had received a legal claim from Wainwright, adding: \u201cAs an ongoing legal process we cannot comment further, suffice to say that we have a very clear policy of solely hiring staff on merit and capabilities, irrespective of their background.\u201d Previously the firm had said Wainwright and others had applied for the job. \u201cDuring the recruitment process,\u201d it said, \u201cwe re-evaluated our resourcing requirements based on the changing needs of the business and external recruitment for the post, along with a number of other similar functional posts, was withdrawn.\u201d",

Paul Pester, chief executive of TSB, said the competition authority had a \u201conce in a generation opportunity\u201d to change the market and break the stranglehold of the big four \u2013 HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 over current accounts. \u201cWe want all bank customers to know what they\u2019re paying for their banking; all customers \u2013 including overdraft users \u2013 to be able to switch easily; and all customers to be aware of their right to switch banks. Only then will competition really start to work and the culture of UK banks finally shift to serving customers on their terms \u2013 rather than on the banks\u2019,\u201d said Pester. Better information about the cost of current accounts, particularly for those with overdrafts, could lead to 10 times more customers switching, he said. Between 2% and 4% of customers switch their current account provider. As it announced its first quarter results, TSB said it was beating its target to attract 6% of all customers switching or opening a current account, winning 7.1% of customers during the first three months of the year. TSB was spun out of Lloyds Banking Group to meet demands imposed by the EU during the 2008 taxpayer bailouts and was floated on the stock market in June 2014 and taken over by Sabadell of Spain in March 2015. The bank, which has around 600 branches, has attracted some controversy for a system of profiling customers, putting them in four categories: logical thinker, amiable, controller or emotional expressive. Pester said he would fall into the logical thinker category and insisted that the process was not intended to generate sales. \u201cIt\u2019s not about selling stuff \u2026 Our whole model is to have great products and great service.\u201d The CMA has delayed its report into the banking industry to give it time to come up with ways of improving service to customers who have overdrafts. The final report was originally scheduled for May but there was criticism of its proposals to increase competition when the provisional findings were published in October. The final outcome is now expected in August \u2013 two years after it was launched.",

      "bodyText": "Bookmaker Ladbrokes has been hit by the worst Cheltenham horse racing festival in living memory, which left the betting industry nursing collective losses of more than \u00a360m. Cheltenham proved disastrous for bookmakers, as nine favourites and one joint favourite won in the 28 races over four days. Former Barclays banker Rich Ricci, now a racehorse owner, scooped almost \u00a3400,000 atthe festival when three of his horses romped home. The racing results forced rival William Hill to issue a profit warning last month. Ladbrokes\u2019 chief executive, Jim Mullen, said its results would meet expectations, despite the hit from Cheltenham, as he reported a 10.6% rise in group net revenues in the first quarter. Sporting results were favourable up until Cheltenham, he said. The festival \u201cproved to be the worst in living memory, which took some of the shine off the period\u201d. He added that \u201cexperience tells us to expect results to normalise over time\u201d. Mullen said intense competition at the festival had pushed the industry into offers and pricing which \u201cabandoned bookmaking principles\u201d. Ladbrokes offered punters money back on first races, and other bookmakers offered best price on every race. Mullen told analysts that while bookmakers were in the gambling industry, they should not gamble themselves. The industry ditched many of those offers at the Grand National at Aintree, and fared better with the winner, Rule the World, a 33-1 outsider. Ladbrokes said it would lose \u00a33m should Leicester City win the Premier League. Its performance will also depend on the outcome of the European football championships in June. It noted that France remained favourites followed closely by Germany and Spain. The company\u2019s retail net revenues in the UK were up 4.1% between January and March, while in Europe they rose 6.5%. Digital net revenues jumped 36.5%, as online gaming continues to gain in popularity. Ladbrokes slumped to a \u00a343m loss last year, its first in a decade, owing to the cost of shutting and refurbishing betting shops, revamping its digital business and implementing its proposed merger with Coral, which still needs to be cleared by regulators. The Competition and Markets Authority has postponed the publication of its provisional findings until mid-May. Mullen said there was plenty of evidence to suggest that the group\u2019s turnaround plan was working but added that it was still early days. More than 70 shops have been refurbished. Steve Clayton, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cCurrent trading at Ladbrokes is encouraging, but in truth, a little bit of a sideshow in the short term. The real story here is whether the merger with Coral will be allowed, and for that news we must wait a while longer. If it does go through, the deal could be transformational for the group. \u201cA merged Ladbrokes and Coral will have a dominant retail position, even if many shops have to be sold off. We expect substantial cost saving will be possible because there will be vast areas of overlap and unnecessary duplication of functions across the combined business.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain borrowed more than expected in the last financial year as local councils sought to fill the gap created by deep budget cuts by dipping into reserves and increasing their debts. Local authorities borrowed \u00a36bn, more than \u00a34bn higher than the previous 12 months, offsetting bumper tax receipts and a clampdown on central government spending. The figures were another blow to George Osborne\u2019s attempts to eliminate the deficit, which hit \u00a374bn in the 2015-16 financial year, almost \u00a32bn more than the official forecast of \u00a372.2bn from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in last month\u2019s budget. In 2010 the chancellor expected the deficit to be more than two-thirds lower at \u00a320bn. But he has since been knocked off course by the negative effects of his own austerity measures on growth, the 2012 eurozone crisis and the slowdown in China. Renewed momentum in the last year has brought the deficit down by almost \u00a318bn, which the Treasury said came after the lowest monthly borrowing in March for a decade. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the trend in public borrowing has improved over recent months, but the lagging nature of the public finances \u201csuggests that they have not registered yet the impact of the recent economic slowdown\u201d. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing excluding the bailed-out banks was \u00a34.8bn in March, well below the \u00a37.4bn in March 2015 and better than the consensus among City analysts of a \u00a36bn shortfall. In February, public sector borrowing fell by just \u00a3500m to \u00a37.1bn compared with the same month last year. During the year to March tax receipts grew by 5.4%, from 4.7% in February. The improvement was broad-based, with income tax receipts up 4.9%, VAT receipts up 5.2% and corporation tax receipts up 3.0%. Meanwhile, central government current expenditure rose just 0.8% year-over-year. Tombs warned of a growing risk of a much bigger overshoot this year because the economy has slowed, with a slowdown in tax receipts likely. \u201cWith the fiscal projections also resting on optimistic assumptions for revenues from tax avoidance measures and savings from the welfare budget, we continue to think that the chancellor will have to implement even more austerity than planned to achieve a budget surplus by 2020.\u201d Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said Osborne would \u201cprobably be pretty relieved\u201d that a much improved March performance meant that he missed the OBR\u2019s target by only a narrow margin. \u201cFurthermore, he can argue that the public finance data will be revised many times over the coming months so there is a realistic chance that the final figure will show that he achieved his targets,\u201d said Archer. The Treasury said: \u201cToday\u2019s figures confirm that the record postwar deficit we inherited has been cut by almost two-thirds as a share of GDP. \u201cWe are borrowing \u00a318bn less than last year and March\u2019s monthly borrowing was the lowest for a decade. But while the deficit is falling, the job of repairing the public finances is not done and the budget set out action to ensure that debt falls in 2016-17 and Britain is back in the black by the end of this parliament.\u201d The total national debt has now hit \u00a31,594.1bn, equivalent to 83.5% of GDP, up from about 40% before the 2008 financial crash.",

The acquisition, from French engineering group Safran, is Smiths\u2019 first deal for a number of years and comes as a new management team gets to grips with the business. Analysts believe Smiths sell off unwanted operations to reduce borrowings after the cash and debt funded deal. Smiths chief executive Andy Reynolds Smith said: The threat environment for people and critical infrastructure around the world is constantly evolving and becoming more complex and sophisticated. The response, to keep people safe and the world running, demands cutting-edge technology and cost-efficient solutions. Morpho Detection is a high quality business with a strong management team, and I am convinced that this combination provides a compelling competitive platform for product, service and technology leadership. The deal had been suggested last month, but confirmation of the news has pushed up Smiths\u2019 shares 45p higher to \u00a311.53. Analysts at Stifel said: This [deal] was suggested in the press some weeks ago, and we commented at that time that we saw this as a positive strategic move, if Smiths were able to secure a deal. That remains our view. This acquisition will give Smiths Detection clear global leadership across all key geographies and technologies, and a much expanded aftermarket revenue stream. The deal is being funded out of existing cash and debt facilities; we estimate that this will push net debt/EBITDA to 2.2 times, but we believe that the group is also looking at asset and business disposals as part of the portfolio review; this debt level is thus likely to be temporary. We think the main positive of this announcement is that it shows the new management team returning to active portfolio management \u2013 a key part of our buy case on the stock. The key attraction for Smiths is Morpho\u2019s strong position in the US market, leading technology in tomography-based baggage scanning systems (Smiths leads in X-ray based detection) and substantial aftermarket revenue stream. Michael Blogg at Investec said: The vibe has changed with the arrival of the new management team and Morpho Detection is set to be the first sizeable acquisition for years. [Morpho] looks a better business than Smiths Detection and less dependent on new project work (Morpho $320m revenue and 18% operating margin; Smiths Detection \u00a3467m revenue and 11.8% operating margin). This may not be the area where shareholders would necessarily have wanted expansion, in view of the mixed record, and the deal will take leverage to at least 2 times EBITDA (the pro forma 2 times is based on debt before over \u00a3100m of payments into the pension funds), meaning firepower has been used up for the time being.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers have been hit by a sharp drop in sales as shoppers cut back on food and clothes in the latest sign households are nervous about the economic outlook. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retail sales volumes decreased 1.3% last month, a much sharper drop than the 0.1% dip forecast by economists in a Reuters poll. Sales were up 2.7% on the year, well below forecasts for 4.4% growth. Statisticians said the main drag came from food and clothing, echoing other reports that fashion sales had suffered from unsettled weather while the early Easter had done little for grocers. The data will fan fears that the UK economy has lost momentum in the face of a slowdown in global trade and as domestic spending is dented by uncertainty before June\u2019s referendum on EU membership. The first official snapshot of UK GDP growth in the opening quarter is to be released next week. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said March\u2019s sharp drop in retail sales was disappointing. \u201cThese figures reinforce our view that UK economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2016,\u201d he said. Consumer spending has been the main driver of UK economic growth, helped by high employment, rock-bottom interest rates and low inflation, but recent surveys suggest households are getting a tighter hold on the purse strings as worries grow about the domestic and global economy. \u201cMarch\u2019s retail sales figures confirm that trading over the Easter holidays was unusually quiet, adding to evidence of a consumer slowdown,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cIt is clear that the consumer recovery is losing pace.\u201d But this month could bring some respite for retailers, Tombs added. \u201cSales likely will bounce back in April, particularly if consumers undertake clothing purchases that they have foregone recently.\u201d The ONS said clothing sales fell 2.3% on the month while household goods sales were down 2.9%. The less volatile figures for three months taken together also pointed to a slowdown. Sales volumes rose 0.8% in the first quarter on 2016, down from growth of 1.0% in the final three months of 2015. In value terms, the amount spent at retailers in March was down 0.1% on a year ago and 1.3% from the month before. The news from online sales was somewhat brighter. They were up 8.9% on the year but down 0.5% on the month. The amount spent in the retail industry decreased by 0.1% compared with March 2015 and decreased by 1.3% compared with February 2016. The ONS said average store prices fell by 3% on the year, the 21st consecutive month of year-on-year price falls. Against the backdrop of falling shop prices, and generally low inflation, the Bank of England has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5%. Kern said policymakers at the Bank should continue to sit tight on borrowing costs. \u201cThe fact that store prices declined further in March confirms our assessment that overall inflationary pressures in the economy are still muted, and strengthens the argument for the monetary policy committee to persevere with the current low level of interest rates for the time being to support the fragile recovery.\u201d The official retail data chimes with industry figures earlier this month that also showed a weak March for retailers. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said unsettled weather had hit demand for clothes while takings at grocers were hurt by lower food prices and Easter closures. The BRC said like-for-like sales values fell 0.7% in March on a year earlier, the biggest drop since last August. Sales were flat on a year ago in total terms, which does not adjust for the effect of new store openings.",

Sales volumes rose 0.8% in the first quarter on 2016, down from growth of 1.0% in the final three months of 2015.</p> <p>In value terms, the amount spent at retailers in March was down 0.1% on a year ago and 1.3% from the month before.</p> <p>The news from online sales was somewhat brighter. They were up 8.9% on the year but down 0.5% on the month.</p> <p>The amount spent in the retail industry decreased by 0.1% compared with March 2015 and decreased by 1.3% compared with February 2016.</p> <p>The ONS said average store prices fell by 3% on the year, the 21st consecutive month of year-on-year price falls.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of falling shop prices, and generally low inflation, the Bank of England has kept interest rates at a record low of 0.5%. Kern said policymakers at the Bank should continue to sit tight on borrowing costs.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that store prices declined further in March confirms our assessment that overall inflationary pressures in the economy are still muted, and strengthens the argument for the monetary policy committee to persevere with the current low level of interest rates for the time being to support the fragile recovery.\u201d<br></p> <p>The official retail data chimes with industry figures earlier this month that also showed a weak March for retailers. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/12/uk-retailers-sales-hit-by-bad-weather-and-early-easter\">unsettled weather had hit demand for clothes while takings at grocers were hurt by lower food prices</a> and Easter closures.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.brc.org.uk/brc_home.asp\">BRC</a> said like-for-like sales values fell 0.7% in March on a year earlier, the biggest drop since last August. Sales were flat on a year ago in total terms, which does not adjust for the effect of new store openings.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The gender wage gap is not shrinking \u2013 it\u2019s growing. Female college graduates now earn $8,000 a year less than their male contemporaries, a gap that has widened in the past 16 years, according to a new report published by the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cYoung male college graduates earned 8.1% more in 2016 than in 2000, while young female college graduates earned 6.8% less than in 2000,\u201d according to Elise Gould, senior economist at EPI and one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cThat gender wage gap has increased in a meaningful way,\u201d Gould said. \u201cIf you just look at their wages in 2016, on average young men who are college graduates are making $20.94 compared to $16.58 for women. That\u2019s a difference of more than $4. Over the year, that\u2019s more than $8,000.\u201d According to Gould, this is due to the fact that men in higher positions are driving up wages for men lower on the totem pole as well. For women, however, the wage gap gets wider as they move further up the pay scale. Overall, women earn less than men. According to the US census, women were still earning just 79% of men\u2019s wages in 2014. Critics of the gender wage gap theory point out that the discrepancy in pay between men and women is due to the types of careers women opt for. Meaning that women are more likely to work in lower-paying jobs like retail, fast food, teaching or nursing. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting idea when you say that out loud: \u2018Women chose lower paying jobs\u2019. Who would chose a lower paying job? How does that even make sense?\u201d said Gould. She added that it\u2019s true women might be likely to select different majors than men and that men tend to end up in higher professions. \u201cIt\u2019s still remains a fact that even within occupations, even within let\u2019s say finance, women are making less than men. So some of it is because of the major or occupation that somebody chose, but those could also be driven by discrimination at younger ages.\u201d According to her, there is a lack of encouragement for women to go into Stem fields \u2013 science, technology, engineering and math. These fields, which tend to be dominated by men, are associated with higher paid positions. \u201cSome say there isn\u2019t really a gender pay gap. Well, that is just wrong,\u201d said former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, when she appeared on a panel discussing equal pay last week. She, too, conceded that higher paying fields like engineering, science and mathematics can often be unwelcoming to women. Gould also pointed out that the economy is filled with people who do not have a college degree. A strong economy caters to these workers \u2013 usually high-school graduates \u2013 and provides them with good jobs in which they can build a stable career, she said. College graduates make up less than a third of US population. In 2014, 29.9% of men and 30.2% of women had graduated college. According to the US Census Bureau, it was \u201cthe first year that women\u2019s college attainment was statistically higher than men\u2019s college attainment\u201d. Similarly, 65.8% of Americans aged 24 to 29 do not have a college degree, according to EPI\u2019s report. However, female high school graduates are faced with narrower gender wage gap. \u201cGender wage gap among high school grads has been closing over the last several years. That\u2019s due to the fact that women have been bolstered by minimum wage increases in cities and states,\u201d explained Gould, pointing out that women account for 55.9% of workers earning minimum wage. \u201cIt\u2019s growing among college grads.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Anglo American bosses are poised for a showdown with angry investors as the group becomes the latest FTSE 100 company to incite shareholder wrath over executive pay. The mining giant is a braced for a rebellion at its annual meeting on Thursday afternoon, with shareholders expected to oppose the \u00a33.4m pay package for the chief executive, Mark Cutifani. The shareholder group ShareSoc has urged investors to vote against Cutifani\u2019s pay for 2015, a year in which Anglo suspended dividend payments and was the worst FTSE 100 performer. Its shares plunged 72% to 328p from 1,152p. Anglo American said Cutifani\u2019s bonus had been reduced by 40% and his salary had been frozen, but ShareSoc said he could earn \u00a36.3m for achieving targets and \u00a38.8m if he exceeds them. It follows last week\u2019s BP meeting, when almost 60% of the group\u2019s shareholders voted against the \u00a314m pay package handed to the chief executive, Bob Dudley. Investors overwhelmingly rejected Dudley\u2019s huge pay deal, awarded despite record losses, thousands of jobs cuts and a pay freeze for employees. In echoes of the \u201cshareholder spring\u201d of 2012, when several major companies faced rebellions over pay, Smith &amp; Nephew investors also rebelled over pay, with more than 50% voting against pay deals at the medical equipment group. Investors were angered by a decision to allow a long-term incentive plan to pay out \u00a32.1m to 60 senior executives even though the performance criteria had not been reached. The vote on Anglo\u2019s pay report will be non-binding, just as it was at BP. Anglo has been badly hit by a slump in commodities. In December it announced plans to cut 85,000 jobs and dispose of more than half its mines in response to the plunging price of iron ore and other metals.",

And probably the bookmakers, who will likely have to pay out less than if one of the favourites had run away with the league again. Announcing better than expected first quarter results despite a poor Cheltenham racing festival, Ladbrokes said a Leicester win would cost it \u00a33m despite a significant number of punters cashing out their bets already. Meanwhile chief executive Jim Mullen called Cheltenham \u201cthe worst in living memory, which took some of the shine off the period.\u201d Warming to his theme he added: At Cheltenham we were reminded of the intense competition with offers and pricing at levels which, in our view, abandoned bookmaking principles. We competed hard but refused to pursue unsustainable strategies and our stance remains that we will compete where we know we can get the right returns from the right customers. Overall revenues rose 10.9%, with retail up 4.1% and digital jumping 36.5% The company has the European Championship to look forward to in the summer, and said: Recent wins under Roy Hodgson have seen liabilities increase around the England team but France remain favourites followed closely by Germany and Spain. The company\u2019s planned merger with Coral is still going through the regulatory process, and this week the competition authorities extended the timetable to publish their findings until mid-May. Ladbrokes shares are up 1.6% at 118.4p following the figures, and analysts at Davy said: This is an encouraging statement. Ladbrokes\u2019 group revenues in the first quarter were up 10.6% versus our first half expectation of +7.9%. The group should benefit from Euro 2016 in the second quarter and this implies that the revenue beat for the first half as a whole should be greater again. Against a backdrop of negative commentary relating to Cheltenham, we suspect that this statement will very much ease investor concerns. Our current EBIT forecast for Ladbrokes sits 5% above consensus (\u00a399.5m versus \u00a394.8m) and we see scope to increase our numbers by a couple of percent at least at this point. Clearly market revisions should be greater again. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 16.25 points at 6394.01 after UK borrowing was above forecast and retail sales fell by more than expected. Sky is the biggest faller following its figures, down 44.5p at 983.5p. Analysts at Jefferies said: Having talked cautiously in recent weeks, Sky\u2019s nine month results beat consensus by 2% at EBIT, in-line on revs. Group EBIT growth of +12% year on year is outstripping revenue growth of +5%. But this should be viewed in the context of weakening customer adds in the UK / Germany, and Champions League costs dropping out of comps in the UK / Italy. On an adjusted basis, UK EBIT now growing in-line with revenues. Overall, no surprises but no clear positive catalyst either, in our view. A number of companies have gone ex-dividend including BAE Systems, down 16.2p at 494.3p, Capita, off 34p at \u00a310.15 and Smith &amp; Nephew, 19p lower at \u00a311.51.",

      "bodyText": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) said it expects the oversupplied oil market to rebalance by next year, as non-Opec production records its biggest decline in a generation. An oil glut has prompted a slump in crude prices from a peak of $115 (\u00a380) a barrel in June 2014, but the IEA executive director, Fatih Birol, said on Thursday that production outside tOpec would fall sharply this year, by almost 700,000 barrels a day. He expects oil markets, and prices, to rebalance at the turn of this year, or by 2017 at the latest. Brent crude, the global benchmark, increased to $45.92 a barrel, up 0.2% on the day, in early London trading. US crude recovered to $44.30, up 0.4% on the day. Birol said low oil prices had led to investment cuts of 40% over the past two years, especially in the US, Canada, Latin America and Russia. After meeting Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, Birol told reporters in Tokyo: \u201cThis year, we are expecting the biggest decline in non-Opec oil supply in the last 25 years, almost 700,000 barrels per day. At the same time, global demand growth is in a hectic pace, led by India, China and other emerging countries.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen we look at all the fundamentals \u2013 demand, supply and stocks \u2013 I have all the reasons to believe that in the absence of a major economic downturn we are going to see balance in the markets latest by 2017.\u201d Birol argued that conditions remained difficult for shale oil producers, despite a recovery in Brent oil prices to above $45 a barrel. \u201cI think $45 is a bit of a relief for all the oil producers around the world, but this is still far lower than to make the entire shale oil production profitable for the United States.\u201d However, Iran is determined to claw back market share after western sanctions were lifted in January, and reiterated plans to reach an output of 4m barrels a day. Saudi Arabia and Russia are also looking to pump more oil. Just days after a global deal to freeze production levels collapsed, Russia\u2019s energy minister said the country might raise oil output to historic highs of more than 12m barrels a day. A lot now hinges on US oil producers. At the moment, global producers are pumping between 1m and 2m more barrels every day than is needed. Analysts at the French bank BNP Paribas said: \u201cAny hope of market rebalancing from the current surplus in supply [lies] on the predicted decline in US oil production. The US accounts for the bulk of non-Opec\u2019s 2016 oil supply contraction of 700,000 barrels per day forecast. If the decline in the US oil supply proves insufficient to tighten balances, then ... the oil price will remain low.\u201d Meanwhile, analysts at Bernstein Research said: \u201cOptimism has returned to energy markets, at least for now.\u201d Bernstein believes US shale oil would have a \u201cclear future\u201d if oil prices rose to $50-$60.",

The mass sell-off on Thursday was on course to push shares down 20% as trades were halted amid an overwhelming number of sell orders, threatening to wipe off one-third of the company\u2019s value in just two days. It followed a 15% fall in shares in Tokyo on Wednesday, when Mitsubishi admitted to falsifying data to flatter the mileage rates clocked up on the vehicles in question. The crisis at the carmaker escalated further when Japanese officials raided one of its offices in Okazaki. The government said the case was \u201cextremely serious\u201d and has given Mitsubishi until 27 April to report on the matter. Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said: \u201cBased on [the results of] the raid, and a report from the company, we would like to reveal the extent of the inaccuracies as soon as possible. \u201cWe will deal with the situation in a strict manner and would like to make sure of the safety of cars.\u201d Japan\u2019s sixth biggest carmaker said tests were falsified on four of its mini-cars, two of which it manufactured for Nissan. The number of Nissan cars affected was 468,000, while 157,000 were sold under the Mitsubishi brand. Mitsubishi said the cars affected were only sold in Japan. However, it said it would extend its investigation to cover cars made for overseas markets. Akira Kishimoto, analyst at JP Morgan, said the scandal could cost Mitsubishi more than 50bn yen (\u00a3314m), including compensation to Nissan and consumers plus the cost of replacing parts. Kishimoto added: \u201cIn addition to the costs of the scandal, the secondary effects on worldwide sales could be very large.\u201d Mitsubishi is the latest carmaker to be embroiled in scandal, after Volkswagen admitted last year that it rigged emissions tests. VW has set aside \u20ac6.7bn (\u00a34.8bn) to pay for the crisis and its shares are down almost one-third since the scandal was revealed in September.",

      "bodyText": "Anglicare Australia has just released its seventh annual rental affordability snapshot, which shows that rental affordability for the poorest in Australia has slightly improved over the past year but for many remains extremely low. The report\u2019s recommendations will be of particular interest, given the ALP\u2019s policy on negative gearing, with Anglicare arguing that the current tax system of negative gearing and capital gains does not serve the common good. Whenever talk turns to housing affordability, inevitably it deals with the ability to buy a house rather than rent. And while we can argue over whether or not young people need to give up their latte, or whether things are significantly worse than 20 years ago, the issue of rental affordability is often forgotten. And yet for many Australians the dream of owning a home is closer to fantasy and the issue of rental affordability is a daily concern. The Anglicare Australia snapshot involves a survey each April of 75,410 rental property listings across Australia. The report considers a property to be affordable if the rent takes up less than 30% of the household\u2019s income. The report then considers the affordability for households across a variety of income levels \u2013 using the maximum rate of Centrelink pensions, allowances such as the aged pension, Newstart, disability support, the single parenting payment and the minimum wage (or a combination of the minimum wage and payments). Rental prices in the past year have largely followed the general low inflation growth. While housing prices have risen strongly (even if that strength appears to have weakened somewhat in the past few months), rents across Australia increased in 2015 by just 1.2% \u2013 a lower amount than the overall inflation measure of the consumer price index: This aspect is crucial because the Newstart benefit is indexed each March and September by the rise in the CPI (the aged pension is indexed by the higher of CPI and Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index and then benchmarked against average male weekly earnings). While, for most of the past decade, rental prices have been going up by more than either inflation or the minimum wage, in the past year people\u2019s incomes have been the ones rising the most \u2013 even if that rise is historically low. And the low rental price growth is pretty consistent across Australia \u2013 in some capital cities such as Perth and Canberra, rental prices have actually been falling: But the price of rents and wage and inflation growth also need to be taken into context. Yes the past year may have been good, but when looking at affordability it pays to have a longer perspective. Over the past decade rental prices have increased by 52%, whereas the minimum wage in that time has risen by just 35% and inflation by a mere 29%. Thus, for someone on the minimum wage, rental payment takes up a significantly larger chunk of income than it did ten years ago. But in the past year at least the story is somewhat improved \u2013 although it depends upon the region and the type of family. While payments may have increased by more, the ability to afford a rental property is also dependent upon supply \u2013 a one bedroom flat may be affordable for a single person on Newstart but isn\u2019t suitable at all for a couple with two children with one adult earning the minimum wage \u2013 which is why the snapshot take the size of the property into account. Across Australia rental affordability has improved the most for single persons on minimum wage. But even here the improvement is quite varied. In greater Sydney and the Illawara, there was no improvement in affordability for such person, but in Melbourne there was a 9.6 percentage point improvement, and in Perth it was just 0.5 percentage points: That the improvement is best for those on the minimum wage is not too surprising given it grew by 2.5% in the past year compared with 1.7% for the inflation rate \u2013 and highlights that, above else, income growth is the major determinant of affordability. But even with these general improvements the situation is still pretty bleak \u2013 and especially so for those on government benefits. The Anglicare snapshot found that \u201csingles living on an age pension could afford just 2.1% of the listed properties\u201d and that singles \u201cliving on the disability support pension could afford a mere 0.5%.\u201d But it is those on Newstart (a maximum of $527.90 a fortnight) and the youth allowance who struggle the most. This year, of the 75,410 rental properties, surveyed across Australia, just 21 were affordable for a single person on Newstart and just 121 for a single person on Newstart with one child: The affordability for all family types and income sources also ranges across the nation \u2013 with large differences between the city and regional areas. For example, in the NSW central-west region around 54% of applicable rental properties are affordable for a couple, both on the minimum wage with two children; compared with just 6.4% of such properties in the greater Sydney/Illawarra area: And even within specific areas the difference in affordability is quite broad. For example in the Gladstone/Rockhampton region half of rental properties are affordable for a family of four with one parent on minimum wage and one on government benefits, but just 4% are affordable for a single person on the disability support pension: The report highlights the real struggles for many in society, for whom the standard debate around housing affordability has little to do with their reality. Anglicare Australia argues the finding show that despite any slight improvement, there remains a need for \u201ca national plan to address housing affordability\u201d. Among the issues they call for are a \u201cserious commitment to reforming the current tax system\u201d. Negative gearing and capital gains tax are the key issues on this score. The report argues that \u201cwhile negative gearing and capital gains rules may once have had an important role encouraging investment in property, these tax measures are increasingly locking current and future generations out of the property market.\u201d Rather pointedly the report notes that Anglicare Australia does not believe the current negative gearing and CGT laws \u201cserve a purpose for the common good.\u201d The report also argues that there needs to be \u201ca system-wide review of other taxes, such as stamp duties and land taxes, to consider their individual and collective impact on housing affordability.\u201d The report also argues that governments need to ensure \u201cthe supply of housing is better matched to people\u2019s needs\u201d and that the \u201csupply of social housing\u201d needs to grow. But finally, as the figures show, the best way to increase rental affordability is for income to increase faster than rental prices. To this end Anglicare calls for an increase in both the rates and the indexation of Newstart and youth allowances. Given the minor reductions in unaffordability over the past year due to the historically low level of rental price growth, it is hard not to agree with the report\u2019s conclusion that without changes to the current tax regimes and supply policies \u201cwe are unlikely to see a significant change in the affordability of rental properties for people on low incomes.\u201d",
