      "bodyText": "This week saw the government continue its shift into budget mode with the announcement of proposed funding for a Melbourne airport-city rail link. It highlights that this budget, for all the talk you will hear about jobs and growth, will in reality be completely focused on the next election. While Malcolm Turnbull does not need to call an election until May next year (18 May is the latest date), owing to the vagaries of the rules relating to half-Senate election, it can be held anytime from 4 August onwards. Of course the current thinking is that no prime minister would be in a rush to call an election when he hasn\u2019t won a poll for over a year. Why rush to electoral defeat when there\u2019s always a chance that fortunes may change. It certainly can\u2019t hurt to wait. For his part, Turnbull is very much in the \u201cno election this year\u201d camp. He told Neil Mitchell on 3AW radio this week that the next election will \u201cbe in the first half of next year\u201d. But even with that period, it means that this year\u2019s budget will be the last before the election and is in effect a pre-election budget. This is a fortunate bit of timing for the government because the budget is in a much nicer state than was expected not only last May, but even last December when the mid-year fiscal and economic outlook was released. The latest Department of Finance figures show the government has received $5.5bn more revenue than it expected in the current financial year when it updated the budget numbers for the Myefo. $3bn of this is from company taxes, $1.2bn from individual income tax and a further $1.2bn from the GST and other duties. It means the government has a lot more money to play with \u2013 always a good thing when you feel the need to improve your standing with voters. While post-budget poll bounces are largely more hoped for than achieved, it is always worth remembering that Tony Abbott\u2019s 30 Newspoll losses began in the run up to Joe Hockey\u2019s first horror budget in 2014, the release of which pretty much ensured polling would never recover. The last thing Turnbull and Scott Morrison would wish to be doing at this stage in the electoral cycle is talking about the need to tighten belts; much preferred is to start bringing home the bacon. And that means doling out the pork. This bring us to the announcement this week of $5bn funding for the Melbourne airport-city rail link. The announcement is big enough to get the wow factor and is rail and thus has a vibe of being \u201cgood\u201d \u2013 or at least better than building new roads (and certainly different from what Abbott would propose). But don\u2019t be fooled into thinking the focus of this week was infrastructure and economic growth; it was politics. For a start, the $5bn funding is contingent on the Victorian government contributing the same amount. Now that is likely, but is also subject to a lot of negotiation over aspects including the actual route of the rail line. Were it a proposal all about economic growth and need, you would expect the two governments to be making the announcement together; instead members of the Victorian government were nowhere to be seen at the press conference announcing the funding. In a move that made his intentions transparent, the prime minister only sent a letter to the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, informing him of the announcement around midnight the night before. Handily, Andrews was able to read about the plan that morning as the Herald Sun had a big splash on it over its front page. Yes, those who use the airport will like it, but despite the prime minister\u2019s claims that \u201ceverybody in Melbourne uses this airport\u201d the reality is they don\u2019t and not in sufficient numbers that will see the benefits from a rail link be widely spread. The prime minister argued that the rail link will be a \u201ccongestion-busting piece of infrastructure\u201d and yet it is unlikely to do much unless coupled with increased tolls that actually reduce the demand for people to use the road. A study for Infrastructure Victoria by KPMG-Arup and Jacobs concluded that that the project will \u201chave minimal impact on overall demand for road and public transport\u201d and that as result the main beneficiaries would not be users of the Tullamarine Freeway but rather \u201ctravellers and people accessing Melbourne airport for leisure purposes\u201d. Similarly, as Infrastructure Victoria noted in its 30-year plan, the optimum need for link will be in 15 to 30 years\u2019 time \u2013 with the economically optimal opening year for such a rail link estimated to be between 2036 and 2039. But that aside, no one is suggesting this will happen soon. Even the prime minister has been cautious not to suggest construction would start before 2020, and Andrews has previously suggested construction work on the airport-rail link will be \u201cwell under way\u201d by \u201cthe time the Metro Tunnel is completed in 2026\u201d. But the project is popular \u2013 not surprisingly Bill Shorten quickly came out in support of the proposal \u2013 and in a pre-election budget, popularity rather than economic need will take precedence. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "As Britain bids farewell to the single market, plenty of businesses are looking further afield for export opportunities. Some are jumping aboard the trade missions organised by Liam Fox\u2019s department for international trade, while others look to their local chambers of commerce to take them on visits to the far-flung nations trumpeted by Fox as among the fastest growing on the planet. It is an exciting prospect and one that holds out the prospect of replacing lost trade with the EU. Unfortunately it means these businesses could also be preparing, however unwittingly, to pay bribes and enter corrupt dealings with public officials \u2013 if not directly, then through the intermediaries that provide links in the chain between themselves and foreign consumers. Is corruption so pervasive? In Transparency International\u2019s list of corrupt nations, the UK, along with most of western Europe, is generally virtuous. In the words of the organisation \u2013 which the World Bank and many governments rely on as a guide to global corruption \u2013 two-thirds of the 180 countries and territories surveyed in 2017, most of them beyond Europe\u2019s borders, are \u201ccorrupt\u201d or \u201chighly corrupt\u201d. More than 100,000 businesses, households and experts are quizzed by the organisation about how much corruption they believe exists and to what extent they have been offered, or used, bribes. It is clear from its findings that the further east from Vienna and south from Munich you go, the more likely you are to find a hand that needs greasing if you want something done. Vienna marks the boundary line that Professor Andrew Kakabadse draws when he lectures at Henley Business School on the extent of bribery and corruption in business and public sector organisations. Mexico, Brazil and South Africa are among those spiralling into a mire that they may not be able to escape any time soon. The \u201ccar wash\u201d scandal in Brazil is an example of how far the tentacles of corruption can reach into civil society. That investigation started as a small-time money laundering probe into a car wash operated by a local gangster, until it became apparent that a senior executive at the state oil company Petrobras was using the company as a front to pay bribes. Eventually, hundreds of officials were implicated and President Lula da Silva himself became embroiled. There was a brief moment when it appeared the probe was going to cleanse the country of businesspeople and public officials involved in corruption. But resistance from parliament and officialdom has quickly undermined that idea. Last week, an attempt to revive a law that allows prosecuted criminals to stay out of prison while they appeal was only narrowly defeated. The decision meant that Da Silva, who favoured the law\u2019s return, gave himself up to the courts. However, that was a lone victory in an otherwise dire situation, and was only achieved by a five-to-four vote in the supreme court. Most corruption doesn\u2019t make the headlines: it is more mundane, involving officials on low and middle incomes, and operates with the tacit approval of government, rather than its active involvement. Kakabadse says the usual scenario involves making contact with a local agent who can introduce a company to important officials. \u201cThe key introductions will be with government \u2013 local, regional or central \u2013 in order to obtain licences to trade. The agent will let the exporter know a total fee, without giving details of any bribes or foreign bank accounts used. The exporter simply has to make a payment to the agency in question as a total fee.\u201d Four years ago, Mexico appeared to be beginning the arduous task of tackling corruption under President Nieto. Then he was forced to defend his wife against accusations that she took kickbacks in a property deal: a brief period of hope was dashed and business as usual resumed. In the health service, whether in the private or public sector, if doctors control budgets for equipment and drugs, they can insist on bribes as the price of a contract. Mexico imports medical equipment mostly from the US, Germany, France, Israel and the UK. Far too many companies involved will be turning a blind eye to the backhanders that their agents price into the cost of doing business. India\u2019s prime minister visits the UK this week. Several Indian journalists have been killed recently trying to unearth corruption. It\u2019s not a subject that is expected to surface in talks that Fox expects to be the precursor of a trade deal.

All the same, Lagarde has plenty to worry about as she prepares for this week\u2019s half-yearly meeting of the International Monetary Fund, the organisation run by the former French finance minister. Her concerns can be summed up in five words: protectionism, unilateralism, war, debt and inequality. The IMF has been issuing increasingly firm warnings about the risk of a trade war in the 16 months since Donald Trump won the US presidency. But it has only been in the past three months that Trump has started to make good on the pledges made during his campaign. Tariffs on imported steel and aluminium imports were followed by US action specifically targeted at China. Lagarde\u2019s concern is not just that Washington and Beijing will become embroiled in a trade war, but that protectionism will spread in a fashion not seen since the 1930s. That anxiety has been heightened by Trump\u2019s go-it-alone approach. The US was instrumental in creating the world\u2019s four key multilateral organisations \u2013 the United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF and the World Trade Organisation \u2013 but the current president appears to have scant regard for any of them. Lagarde would like to see the US settle its trade differences with China at the WTO but there is little immediate prospect of that. The risk of war between Russia and America over Syria is the most pressing example of the \u201cuncertain geopolitics\u201d mentioned by Lagarde in her Hong Kong speech. Here, Trump has been seeking to secure the support of the US\u2019s traditional allies \u2013 such as Britain and France \u2013 for military action, but financial markets are already taking fright at the prospect of oil supplies from the Middle East being disrupted. Oil prices rose to their highest since late 2014 when last week\u2019s tension was at its height. Deep down, the IMF thinks the recovery from the 2008 financial crash is fragile and incomplete. It is fragile because a decade of cheap money has left the global economy wallowing in $164 trillion of private and public debt \u2013 an all-time high. It is incomplete because too many people have been left behind during the upswing that followed the deep recession of 2008-09. Back in 2006 and early 2007, the IMF was asleep at the wheel as the global economy careered towards a devastating crisis. Lagarde wants to ensure there is no repeat performance.",

      "bodyText": "From Syria to social media, world leaders have many urgent matters to discuss when they congregate at international gatherings. But it is the threat to the world economy from Donald Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China that is poised to dominate the annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank this week. Opening in Washington on Monday and hosted by the IMF, the meetings will be attended by leaders and central bankers, including Mark Carney of the Bank of England and the chancellor, Philip Hammond. Both organisations are chiefly concerned with the global economy. The IMF is the world\u2019s lender of last resort, helping to bail out struggling countries and promote financial stability. The World Bank is focused on lending to poor and middle-income countries; its meetings in the US capital will be attended by international development ministers, including the UK\u2019s Penny Mordaunt. The gatherings are taking place at a difficult moment for the world economy, which is starting to show signs of faltering after the best year for growth since the financial crisis. The IMF meeting comes nearly three months after Trump spoke at Davos, when there was less news from the global economy to worry the world\u2019s elite. The intervening weeks have been marked by a rollercoaster ride for financial markets, rattled by fears over rising inflation as well as weaker economic data and tougher talk from the White House on trade tariffs. Alongside the prospect of a breakdown in global trade, other items likely to be on the agenda are the mounting tensions in the Middle East and the prospect of a new cold war between the west and Russia, as well as the possibility of central banks raising interest rates more quickly than expected in order to curb inflationary pressures. Facebook\u2019s control of personal data and the role of big technology companies in society, as well as gender equality and the divide between rich and poor, will also feature. How high-stakes are this year\u2019s meetings? Lucy O\u2019Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, says: \u201cThere\u2019s been a fair amount of competition over the past 10 years, when IMF meetings have been important at many points. But this [year] feels timely, given the issues around trade.\u201d Trade war Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the IMF, warned last week the current system for world trade was \u201cin danger of being torn apart\u201d, with the potential to upset the current economic upswing and make consumers poorer. In a speech in Hong Kong setting the tone for this week\u2019s meeting, Lagarde said there were \u201cdarker clouds looming\u201d for the global economy as trade tensions simmer between the US and China. Although the spring meeting won\u2019t act as a forum for solving the impasse, it could help policymakers better understand the consequences or likely remedies for the dispute. Although there have been warmer words from Washington and Beijing over the standoff in recent days, Bill Blain of the City trading firm Mint Partners says: \u201cWhatever the pundits and analysts say \u2026 the game is not over.\u201d But while the trade war between the US and China ticks over, there are signs of a new cold war between Russia and the west heating up over the conflict in Syria, now into its seventh year with little sign of abating. The war will be among the most serious matters beyond the official agenda for world leaders gathering in Washington this week. Trump warned Russia last week to \u201cget ready\u201d for US missile strikes in Syria after a UN security council meeting failed to stave off the prospect of military confrontation. His warning comes in an escalating row between the two countries over the recent chemical weapons attack on the Syrian rebel-held town of Douma. State of the global economy After every one of the world\u2019s biggest economies tracked by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development grew last year, there are fears that the synchronous upswing for global growth could be fading. Recent survey data has pointed to weaker growth in Europe, while poor weather has also blown economic activity off course in the past few months. The rate of economic growth in the UK is expected to have fallen by half in the opening months of the year, according to the National Institute for Economic and Social Research. Lagarde also used her speech in Hong Kong to warn that growth would probably begin to falter from the end of next year. The rise of protectionism in the US, and the possibility of a similar approach in Britain after Brexit, could lead to slower global growth if more countries erect greater barriers to international trade, capital flows and migration. According to the consultancy Oxford Economics, an all-out trade war would lead to \u201cpronounced\u201d slowdown for the world economy, knocking 0.5% off worldwide growth. Lagarde will host an event on Thursday to advise politicians to make economic reforms while the \u201csun is still shining\u201d, which could help to sustain the upswing for global growth and spread the benefits across all members of society. Inflation and interest rates Major central banks remained cautious last year despite the widespread rebound for global growth, which might have usually tempted them to begin raising interest rates to prevent inflation from spiralling up. This year could be different: there are flickering signs of stronger growth in prices that could push the world\u2019s most important central bank \u2013 the US Federal Reserve \u2013 to raise rates more quickly than expected. Markets plunged in February on signs of rising pay for American workers, which could lead companies to raise prices to accommodate higher wage bills. US inflation rose at the fastest rate in a year last month. The Fed will probably raise rates three more times this year, with another three increases in 2019, according to Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at the City bank Berenberg. \u201cThe IMF will probably say something along the lines that tighter monetary policy in the US, UK and Europe reflects improving global conditions and should not pose a threat,\u201d he says. Gender and inequality In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal and revelations of pay disparities between men and women in the UK, gender equality issues will be in sharp focus at the IMF meetings this year. The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, will speak about the organisation\u2019s funding for research into the subject around the world. The World Bank and the Sexual Violence Research Initiative are awarding funds to 11 teams across the globe to research ways to address a global epidemic of gender-based violence. More than a third of women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual violence from a partner or from another person, the organisation says. The IMF will also look closely at ways to reform tax and spending policies to help narrow inequality between the rich and poor, as well as suggesting new ways to promote more inclusive growth. Technology After Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance before the US Senate to answer questions over data misuse last week, the IMF will take another look at the shifting sands for global technology companies. Lagarde will lead a panel discussion titled \u201cdigitalisation and the new gilded age\u201d, covering the rise to near-monopoly status of the likes of Facebook and Google. It will look at whether now would be time for a new era of \u201ctrust busting\u201d, echoing President Roosevelt\u2019s breakup of once-dominant Standard Oil into 34 companies in the early 20th century. The spectre of \u201ctechnological unemployment\u201d, as foreseen by the British economist John Maynard Keynes, will also be up for discussion, while the president of the World Bank will use a lecture to discuss how technology can help bridge the divide between rich and poor countries. Technology companies have grown so large in recent years that they operate beyond the control of governments \u2013 with some tech evangelists embracing this shift because of its potential to liberate people from the reaches of the state. But the questions over the Facebook data breach in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica revelations may have shown the moment has come when the balance is tipping. Paul Donovan, global chief economist at UBS wealth management, says: \u201cThere is an abrupt realisation that the digital anarchists are wrong and that government is superior, in the sense that it can legislate. That\u2019s a rather abrupt cultural shock for these guys.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The home of the future looks an increasingly attractive place to live this week, after millions of households received the unwelcome news that their energy bills were going up again. Switching supplier is one quick fix to rising bills. But in the long run, industry players say the answers may lie in a coming revolution in how we use energy in our homes, turning them into mini power stations and reducing our reliance on energy companies such as British Gas and EDF. For consumers, cost and convenience will be big factors. For energy firms, there is a chance to rebuild trust and transform themselves from mere suppliers into more profitable service companies. As a report said last week, there also needs to be a debate about how homes can be heated in new ways that reduce their contribution to climate change. Most industry experts think that future homes will consume less energy \u2013 setting aside the impact of electric cars \u2013 as appliances from fridges to boilers become ever more efficient. New buildings are also increasingly airtight, which the Building Research Establishment says has largely been driven by regulations. British Gas owner Centrica, the UK\u2019s largest energy supplier, and Ovo, one of the biggest \u201cchallenger\u201d firms, both told the Observer they expected domestic energy use to continue falling. Customers will not just consume energy, but generate it too, becoming \u201cprosumers\u201d \u2013 \u201ca horrible word but a useful term,\u201d says Tom Pakenham, head of electric vehicles at Ovo, that means \u201cto generate your own energy, store it and use it in intelligent way\u201d. For most people, this will mean solar panels generating electricity, which is not a new trend \u2013 more than 900,000 households already have solar, up from almost none a decade ago. What is new is that consumers are beginning to pair solar with batteries, to store and either use or export the electricity when it makes the most financial sense. Such installations are not officially monitored, but the Solar Trade Association estimates 5,000-10,000 UK homes now have energy storage, fitted by companies including Tesla, E.ON and Nissan. Imperial College has said cheaper home batteries will be a game-changer for utilities. \u201cThe storage aspect is increasingly important,\u201d said Jonathan Tudor, technology and innovation strategy director at Centrica. But energy stored at home might not automatically be consumed by that household. \u201cYou may decide I\u2019ve got excess energy and my personal preference may be to donate that to a vulnerable household down the road,\u201d Tudor said. Centrica has installed about 1.6 million of its smart-home Hive devices, taking on tech titans such as Alphabet-owned Nest, which pioneered smart thermostats. But the company is already looking beyond smart thermostats, lights and plugs, which its data suggests are cutting an average home\u2019s energy use by up to 12%. \u201cWe are looking at how we can take this further: we expect adoption of the \u2018internet of things\u2019 will make more devices smart. You could load your dishwasher and you press start and it does a calculation \u2013 you want it ready by 7am, let the machine decide when to start the cycle, depending not just on pricing but on [energy] grid efficiency,\u201d said Tudor. Smart meters, which the government aims to have offered to every home by the end of 2020, are also seen as key to enabling much of the technology and new pricing. \u201cYou cannot have an intelligent energy system without smart meters,\u201d said Pakenham. The meters will enable more dynamic pricing, where bill payers are charged less for energy at certain times of day, to reduce costs and pressure on the power grid. Other digital technologies are making peer-to-peer energy trading a reality. Last week, a startup called Verv used blockchain for the first time to execute a physical trade of energy on an east London estate, from a rooftop solar array on one block to a resident in another block. Dermot Nolan, chief executive of energy regulator Ofgem, believes peer-to-peer trading is one of the most exciting new business models in energy. Suppliers such as British Gas, instead of just selling gas and electricity, will look to manage how energy is used in the home, and deal with its relationship with the outside world \u2013 handling trading, or managing a household\u2019s electric car battery to help the grid in return for payments. \u201cWe say we can make this more convenient for you,\u201d said Tudor. We may even no longer buy energy, but comfort instead. In one trial of about 100 homes by the government-funded Energy Systems Catapult, people pay not based on usage but by picking a temperature and the number of rooms they heat. \u201cWhat we see is companies adding value for customers, rather than being someone they just have to have,\u201d said John Batterbee, Energy Systems Catapult chief engineer.",
