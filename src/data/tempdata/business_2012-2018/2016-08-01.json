      "bodyText": "Italy\u2019s biggest bank, UniCredit, has borne the brunt of lingering anxiety about the country\u2019s banking sector, seeing its shares fall sharply following the EU-wide banking health checks. The 9.4% drop in UniCredit shares, which were being closely monitored by the Italian Borse on Monday amid heavy trading, followed Friday\u2019s publication of stress tests on 51 banks across the EU. In the European Banking Authority tests, UniCredit recorded a capital ratio of more than 7% after the stress test applied a hypothetical shock to global growth, interest rates and currencies. Although well above the legal minimumof 4.5%, it left Unicredit as one of the five weakest out of the 51 banks tested. The deterioration in its capital ratio was not on the scale of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) \u2013 Italy\u2019s third largest bank \u2013 which announced a rescue package on Friday aimed at funding at least \u20ac5bn worth of capital, after the stress test showed that its entire capital base would be wiped out under the adverse scenario. MPS was the worst-performing bank of any bank tested. Shares in MPS, regarded as the world\u2019s oldest bank, were among the few to rally after the stress test results as its rescue operation appeared to alleviate pressure on the Italian government to intervene. Even so, questions remained about how easily MPS could find investors willing to stump up \u20ac5bn when its existing stock market value was less than \u20ac1bn. The focus had been on Italian banks ahead of the stress tests, which overall showed that the EU\u2019s banking sector could weather a shock to the markets. The pan-European banks share index was off just 0.6%. Antonio Patuelli, president of the Italian Banking Association, welcomed the results, saying: \u201cThe credibility of Italian banks has now been strengthened.\u201d The MPS rescue was viewed as positive. Tomas Kinmonth, fixed income strategist at ABN Amro, said: \u201cIt could be suggested that the prime benefit of the EBA 2016 stress test is that the Italian institution [MPS] is now significantly stronger.\u201d Portuguese and Greek banks were not big enough to be included in the tests, which also focused on banks in Ireland, Spain and Austria as well Germany\u2019s biggest bank, Deutsche, whose capital ratio fell below 8% under the test. Analysts at Capital Economics said: \u201cAmong the eurozone countries, Ireland\u2019s and Italy\u2019s banks stood out.\u201d Moody\u2019s said: \u201cThe stress test results highlight major differences in the relative strength of banking systems across the EU. The system-level results reflect the relative weakness of banks in Austria, Ireland and Italy. The key drivers are elevated credit risk of cross- border activities for the Austrian banks, and domestic market pressures for the Irish and Italian banks.\u201d The stress tests impose a series of scenarios on the capital bases of banks recorded at the end of 2015 and give results for three years later, without allowing the management of the banks to try to raise capital by selling off businesses. Shares in UK banks Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland slipped around 2%. Barclays\u2019 capital ratio fell to below 7.5% under the stressed scenario, while RBS took the third largest hit of any bank to its capital under the test. RBS\u2019s capital position would sink by seven percentage points to 8%. Moody\u2019s said this was in part caused by \u201clitigation and restructuring charges\u201d faced by the bank, which is 73% owned by the UK taxpayer. Gary Greenwood, analyst at Shore Capital, said the results for UK banks were a \u201cnon-event\u201d as they will be subjected to Bank of England tests later in the year. RBS publishes its half-year results this Friday, while Barclays reported a \u00a32bn half-year profit last week.",

They are not designed to show the real state of lenders across the continent, nor do they provide any real insight into how the 51 banks examined in the latest exercise would withstand another crisis. Instead, the stress tests are designed to impart confidence, to explain that things aren\u2019t quite as bad as they appear to be. Even by this measure they have proved to be a failure. This much was evident from the caning taken by bank shares across Europe on Monday, when investors had the opportunity to pass judgment on the findings of the European Banking Authority, which were published after markets closed for business on Friday night. The EBA thinks conditions have improved since the last time it conducted stress tests, in 2014, and that it can now do what it calls \u201csteady-state monitoring\u201d. The 8% drop in the share price of UniCredit, Italy\u2019s biggest bank, and the 3% fall in bank shares across Europe shows that investors see things differently. What\u2019s more, the investors are right. There were three things glaringly wrong with the latest examination. The tests did not include banks from two of the most troubled eurozone countries: Greece and Portugal. They did not test for the most likely problem: a prolonged period of negative interest rates following Brexit that would further impair the profitability of European banks. And they did not say whether individual banks had passed or failed. In order to give the exercise a tinge of credibility, the EBA singled out Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi as a bank that would see all its capital wiped out under certain conditions: recession and a sharp increase in interest rates. Monte dei Paschi duly announced on Friday that it was raising \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.2bn) in capital from private sources. This is good as far as it goes, but the truth is that Monte dei Paschi is the tip of a barely concealed iceberg. The best solution to the problem would be for Europe to copy what the United States did long ago: provide ample quantities of federal capital, write off bad debts and allow some banks to fail. However, this would require the creation of a European banking union, a development that has stalled due to lack of enthusiasm in Germany. The second-best solution would be for Matteo Renzi\u2019s government to be give the all-clear for a national bailout of Italy\u2019s banks, even if this means playing fast and loose with Europe\u2019s state-aid rules. Otherwise, Europe\u2019s banks will, at best, continue to exist in a nether world where they continue in business but are unable to fulfil their prime function, which is to provide loans to the private sector. At worst, they will collapse when the war games end and they are put under real duress. At this point, the stress tests will be exposed for what they are: a sticking plaster over a gaping wound.",

      "bodyText": "Fresh signs of falling demand and job cuts in Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector have raised pressure on the Bank of England to soothe post-referendum jitters with an interest rate cut this week. Factory activity shrank at the fastest pace for more than three years in July as uncertainty about the political and economic outlook hit domestic orders and a weaker pound drove up the cost of imported materials for manufacturers, according to a closely watched survey. News that the decline in manufacturing activity last month was steeper than first thought echoed other reports of a hit to business and consumer confidence from the Brexit vote and sparked fresh calls for government action to shore up economic growth. The latest figures also cemented a view that the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) will deliver the first interest rate cut since the financial crisis and reduce official borrowing costs to a new record low of 0.25% when its latest meeting concludes on Thursday. \u201cAction by the MPC looks ever more certain,\u201d said Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to forecasting body the EY Item Club. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the gloomy manufacturing survey was another warning sign that workers risk paying the price for the economic fallout from Brexit. \u201cThe government should not wait any longer to see which way the wind is blowing. We need an urgent package of public investment to keep the economy moving,\u201d she said. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI survey, which polls more than 600 companies monthly, suggested domestic demand for manufacturers\u2019 goods had been hit by uncertainty both before and after the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership on 23 June. That overshadowed a boost to export orders from a weaker pound, which makes UK goods cheaper. The headline index was the worst since early 2013 and weaker than a \u201cflash\u201d post-referendum estimate published in July. The new reading, which takes in responses from a greater number of firms, stood at 48.2, down from the flash estimate of 49.1 and lower than 52.4 in June. A reading above 50 denotes expansion while a reading below suggests that activity contracted. Responses were collected between 12 and 26 July. The UK reading was much weaker than Markit\u2019s PMI index of eurozone manufacturers. That stood at 52.0 for July, marking the 37th straight month of growth as a strong performance from German manufacturers offset weakness in Italy, Spain, France and Greece. In the UK, manufacturers were already shedding jobs before the referendum and the PMI report showed employment fell for the seventh month running in July. The latest drops in output, new orders and employment were all steeper than the earlier flash estimates, noted Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit.. \u201cThe downturn was felt across industry, with output scaled back across firms of all sizes and across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors, although exporters did report a boost from the weaker pound,\u201d he said. He noted that the pound, which fell sharply against the euro and US dollar after the vote to leave the EU, had helped exports but made imports to the UK more expensive. As fears grow that the economy will slow sharply over coming months, there are expectations the Bank will complement the first rate cut since March 2009 with other measures. Those could include injecting more electronic cash into the economy using quantitative easing, or an expanded scheme to give firms and households better access to credit. The Bank will have more to mull over when Markit releases a poll of the construction sector on Tuesday and of the much bigger services sector on Wednesday. The flash post-referendum PMI report in July already suggested activity fell at the sharpest pace on record in the services sector, which makes up the lion\u2019s share of the UK economy and covers a wide range of businesses from hotels to insurance. That has prompted some economists to predict the economy will tip into recession. But other experts caution against reading too much into surveys taken against a backdrop of political turmoil in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. \u201cIt\u2019s still early days in terms of hard data,\u201d said Ben Brettell, senior economist at the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cSurveys are driven by sentiment, and can therefore overreact. The dramatic fall in confidence may not ultimately be borne out by activity, and there is a case for a wait-and-see approach to monetary policy.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK manufacturing data worse than expected, with mixed US and European results - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Following a positive Markit manufacturing survey, the latest report from the Institute for Supply Managment has come in below expectations. The ISM manufacturing activity index fell to 52.6 in July, down from 53.2 the previous month and lower than the forecast 53. And here, from the report, are some of the views expressed by manufacturers: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. US manufacturing grew more strongly in July, according to the latest Markit data. Its manufacturing PMI came in at 52.9, up from 51.3 in June and in line with the initial estimates. This is the highest level since October, with the employment index at its best since July 2015, which bodes well for Friday\u2019s non-farm payroll numbers. Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: The stronger manufacturing PMI survey data for July fuel hopes that the sector will act as less of drag on the economy in the third quarter after a disappointing first half of the year. Having signalled the sector\u2019s worst performance for over six years in the second quarter, contributing to a sluggishness in the economy that was later seen in the soft GDP numbers, the improvement in July suggests that manufacturers and exporters will have helped lift the economy at the start of the third quarter. Job creation has also picked up, hopefully in a sign that producers are seeing a brighter picture, coping with a strong dollar and having put the worst of the energy sector\u2019s restructuring behind them. Ahead of the two US manufacturing reports due shortly - first Markit, then the Institute for Supply Management - US markets are edging lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down around 28 points while the S&amp;P 500 has opened marginally lower. The two surveys tend to be out of sync, but this time both are expected to show slight improvements. There could be more bad economic news for the UK ahead of the Bank of England\u2019s rate decision on Thursday: And on Wednesday comes the UK service sector PMI which is forecast to be flat on June\u2019s figure. Decisive policy action is needed after the poor UK manufacturing figures, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott: So much for the idea that the post-Brexit hit to UK manufacturing was a knee-jerk reaction to the referendum and that the mood would improve as time wore on. The final figures for how industry fared in July are now in, and they were even worse than the flash estimate released 10 days ago. Some analysts had expressed guarded confidence that Theresa May\u2019s arrival in Downing Street might have made companies less gloomy. While it is still possible that there has been an overreaction to the shock Brexit result, the idea that business will ride things out after a month or two of turbulence now looks fanciful. Policy action \u2013 and decisive policy action at that \u2013 is going to be needed, starting with the Bank of England later this week. More here: Another vote for the Bank of England to not only cut interest rates on Thursday, but also take other measures to help boost the UK economy: A quick comparison of some of the day\u2019s eurozone PMIs: Here\u2019s our story on the poor UK manufacturing figures: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector shrank at the steepest pace for more than three years in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, forcing factories to cut jobs as they grappled with higher costs and lower demand. News that the decline in manufacturing activity in July was steeper than first thought cemented a view that the Bank of England will cut interest rates this week in a bid to shore up business and consumer spending. The closely watched Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing PMI survey, which polls more than 600 companies monthly, suggested domestic demand for manufacturers\u2019 goods had been hit by uncertainty both before and after the UK\u2019s referendum on EU membership on 23 June. That overshadowed a boost to export orders from a weaker pound, which makes UK goods cheaper. The headline index was the worst since early 2013 and weaker than a \u201cflash\u201d estimate published in July. The new reading, which takes in responses from a greater number of firms, stood at 48.2, down from the flash estimate of 49.1 and lower than 52.4 in June. A reading above 50 denotes expansion while a reading below suggests activity contracted. Responses were collected between 12 and 26 July. The full story is here Elsewhere, and there is some fallout from the unexpected decision last week by the UK government to delay plans for the Hinckley Point C nuclear power station: China has warned Britain that it cannot risk driving away Chinese investors as the country\u2019s official news agency questioned the UK government\u2019s postponement of approval for the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. Theresa May, the prime minister, is understood to be concerned about the security implications of a planned Chinese investment in Hinkley and has delayed giving the \u00a318bn project the green light. Xinhua news agency said China understood and respected Britain\u2019s requirement for more time to think about the deal. \u201cHowever, what China cannot understand is the \u2018suspicious approach\u2019 that comes from nowhere to Chinese investment in making the postponement,\u201d it said. More here: Could the UK now go into recession? Here\u2019s Barclays: The disappointing UK manufacturing data and the mixed picture from Europe have taken the edge off stock markets. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Coming in even worse than the initial glimpse revealed a few weeks ago the UK managed a paltry July manufacturing PMI of 48.2, the lowest reading for around 3 years. The effects of this contraction territory figure on the FTSE (which is teetering on the edge of a loss thanks largely to the banking sector) were somewhat mitigated by the fact that it only increases the change of action from the Bank of England on Thursday, the situation now perhaps requiring not only a rate cut but something a bit more substantial. Thanks to this line of thought the pound was the one that suffered following the PMI-reveal, slipping 0.4% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro. The Eurozone had similar, if not quite as severe, issues this Monday. Both Spain and Italy underperformed expectations, while France remained in contraction territory for the 5th consecutive month; only Germany beat estimates at 53.8 against the 53.7 forecast, helping the region-wide figure crawl up to 52.0 from the 51.9 forecast. This couldn\u2019t prevent the DAX from seeing its earlier gains being cut by two thirds, though the German index is still the best performer this morning with a 0.4% rise. Looking ahead to the US open and the focus will remain on the manufacturing sector. The Markit reading is forecast to be confirmed at an improved 52.9 (against 51.3 the month previous), while the ISM figure is set to slip to 53.1 from 53.2. Nothing of this has the Dow Jones too bothered at the moment, the futures suggesting a 35 point rise after the bell. Meanwhile banking shares have turned negative in the wake of the latest European stress test results released late on Friday. Barclays is down nearly 3% and Royal Bank of Scotland is 2.5% lower while Italian banks have fallen sharply: The Bank of England might do more than cut rates on Thursday after the poor UK manufacturing data, suggests David Morrison, senior market strategist at SpreadCo: This latest reading provides the Bank\u2019s MPC with further evidence of a post-Brexit slowdown and makes a rate cut at Thursday\u2019s meeting pretty much inevitable. The only question now is whether they back up a 25 basis point cut with an increase to the Asset Purchase Facility as well. Sterling has fallen back after the disappointing UK manufacturing data, on the basis that an interest rate cut this week is all but nailed on. Against the dollar the pound has dropped 0.11% to $1.3212 and is down marginally against the euro at \u20ac1.183. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 has lost most of its early gains and is now up just 7 points or 0.1%. Mike Rigby, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, said: These disappointing figures would indicate that the uncertainty deterring manufacturers from making vital investment decisions prior to the EU referendum has taken a stranglehold since the vote and we can expect to see businesses continuing to protect cash and guard investment. Such caution is of course understandable and encouragingly the expected rise in exports, given the weaker state of sterling, is materialising but with growth in the sector being very hard-earned, manufacturers will want clarity on what post-Brexit means for their industry sooner rather than later. The UK manufacturing sector shrank at its fastest pace in more than three years, with the new orders index showing its biggest monthly drop in 18 years. Input prices rose to their highest level in five years. The disappointing result, worse than the initial estimate, is another sign that the Brexit vote on 23 June is hitting the country\u2019s economic growth. The figures will put more pressure on the Bank of England to live up to expectations and cut interest rates on Thursday. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: The pace of contraction was the fastest since early-2013 amid increasingly widespread reports that business activity has been adversely affected by the EU referendum. The drops in output, new orders and employment were all steeper than flash estimates... The weakening order book trend and upswing in cost inflation point to further near-term pain for manufacturers. On that score, the weak numbers provide powerful arguments for swift policy action to avert the downturn becoming more embedded and help to hopefully play a part in restoring confidence and driving a swift recovery. UK manfacturing fell by more than initially expected in July. The Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index came in at 48.2, down from 52.4 in June and lower than the already disappointing inital reading of 49.1. Manufacturing growth across the eurozone slipped back in July, with the sector mainly supported by a strong performance from Germany. Markit\u2019s eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 52 in July from 52.8, just above the initial estimate of 51.9. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: The problem is that growth is looking increasingly lop-sided, which will worry policymakers and add to calls for further stimulus from the European Central Bank. Dig deeper beyond the headline numbers and more worrying pictures appear. Expansions in output and employment are clearly being driven to a larger extent by surging growth in German, while growth has almost stalled in both Italy and Spain, and contractions are being seen in France and Greece. And Greece, back in contraction: Over in Germany the manufacturing picture is brighter. The Markit manufacturing PMI came in at 53.8 in July, down slightly from June\u2019s figure of 54.5 but just ahead of forecasts and still well in expansion territory. Markit\u2019s Oliver Kolodseike said: Today\u2019s survey results highlight ongoing steady growth in Germany\u2019s goods-producing sector at the start of the third quarter. Although the headline PMI dropped slightly since June, the underlying growth fundamentals remain strong. The European Central Bank will be pleased to see that input costs rose for the first time in a year during July and selling prices stabilised, thereby adding to hopes that consumer price inflation will edge up in coming months. France\u2019s manufacturing sector improved slightly in July but still contracted for the fifth month in a row. The Markit purchasing managers index edged up from 48.3 in June to 48.6, in line with expectations. Jack Kenedy, a Markit economist, said: July\u2019s PMI data signalled a further modest contraction of the French manufacturing sector, amid continuing fragility in incoming new orders. And here\u2019s the Italian manufacturing PMI, also weaker than expected: Markets are being supported by the expectation that the Bank of England will cut UK interest rates this week, and that the US Federal Reserve will refrain from raising them. The mixed picture so far from the manufacturing data, not to mention Friday\u2019s poor US GDP figures, seems to make this more likely Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: After a positive July for equity investors, August has also started strongly as investors place their bets on accommodative central bank policy from Japan, the US and the UK. While opinions about when the Federal Reserve will eventually raise rates remain divided, the market is all but certain that Mark Carney will cut rates this week to stimulate the UK economy. The only unknown is what additional measures he (or indeed the new Chancellor, Philip Hammond) might take to deliver the required stimulus to boost confidence and avoid a protracted recession. Spain\u2019s manufacturing has come in below expectations: While we await the manufacturing data from Italy, France, Germany and the UK, here are some snapshots from elsewhere, including Russia showing a contraction: Markets have, as expected, opened higher with the FTSE 100 up 26 points or 0.4%. Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.9%, Spain\u2019s Ibex has risen 1%, while France\u2019s Cac and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB are both 0.7% better. In the wake of the banking stress tests released late on Friday, the Stoxx 600 banking index is up 0.9%. Meanwhile, despite the Brexit vote and worries about an economic slowdown, markets recovered some lost ground in July: Developments in Greece with signs of normality returning to the country\u2019s banking system. Helena Smith reports: More than a year after they were imposed, capital controls in Greece will be substantially eased on Monday in a bid to lure back billions of euros spirited out of the country, or stuffed under mattresses, at the height of the eurozone crisis. The relaxation of restrictions, whose announcement sent shockwaves through markets and the single currency, is aimed squarely at boosting banking confidence in the eurozone\u2019s weakest member. The Greek finance ministry estimates around \u20ac3bn-\u20ac4bn could soon be returned to a system depleted of more than \u20ac30bn in deposits in the run-up to Athens sealing a third bailout to save it from economic collapse last summer. \u201cThe objective is to re-attract money back to the banking system which in turn will create more confidence in it,\u201d said Prof George Pagoulatos who teaches European politics and economy at Athens University. \u201cAnd there are several billion that can be returned. People just need to feel safe.\u201d The full story is here: Here\u2019s the PMI agenda courtesy of DailyFX: Here are the opening calls for European markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It being the first of the month, we get the latest snapshot on how the global manufacturing sector performed in July. We\u2019ve already had the Chinese data, and there are more signs of a slowing economy there. The official manufacturing survey fell back unexpectedly, with a slowdown in orders and disruption from flooding. The purchasing managers index fell from 50 in July to 49.9, just in contraction territory (anything below 50). Analysts had been expected a figure of 50 once again. The service sector survey edged up fro 53.7 to 53.9. A private manufacturing survey was a little more positive than the official version. The Caixin/Markit reading came in at a stronger than expected 50.6, the first expansion since February 2015. Meanwhile Japan\u2019s manufacturing PMI also contracted, coming in at 49.3. Shortly come the European and UK figures. In the light of Brexit the UK data will be particularly interesting, ahead of the latest Bank of England decision on Thursday which is expected to see an interest rate cut. The initial reading showed the sharpest downturn in the UK economy since the financial crisis seven years ago, but this may well be revised upwards. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: We saw this fall to 49.1 from 52.1... however there is a chance that we could see this revised higher given that the flash number was taken at a time when political uncertainty was at elevated levels. This is no longer the case and this might be reflected in a slightly improved number. On the European and US data, Hewson said: We will also be getting the latest July manufacturing PMI numbers for Spain, Italy, France and Germany with slowdowns expected for Spain and Italy to 51.6 and 52.2, while France is expected to stay stuck in contraction at 48.6. German manufacturing is expected to show the strongest reading at 53.7. In the US the latest ISM manufacturing report showed a decent recovery in June to 53.2, and the expectation is that this could well continue into July with a reading of 53.1, which may bode well for this week\u2019s jobs data.",

Thanks to this line of thought the pound was the one that suffered following the PMI-reveal, slipping 0.4% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro.</p> <p> The Eurozone had similar, if not quite as severe, issues this Monday. Both Spain and Italy underperformed expectations, while France remained in contraction territory for the 5<sup>th</sup> consecutive month; only Germany beat estimates at 53.8 against the 53.7 forecast, helping the region-wide figure crawl up to 52.0 from the 51.9 forecast. This couldn\u2019t prevent the DAX from seeing its earlier gains being cut by two thirds, though the German index is still the best performer this morning with a 0.4% rise.</p> <p> Looking ahead to the US open and the focus will remain on the manufacturing sector.

The official manufacturing survey fell back unexpectedly, with a slowdown in orders and disruption from flooding.</p> <p>The purchasing managers index fell from 50 in July to 49.9, just in contraction territory (anything below 50). Analysts had been expected a figure of 50 once again. The service sector survey edged up fro 53.7 to 53.9.</p> <p>A private manufacturing survey was a little more positive than the official version. The Caixin/Markit reading came in at a stronger than expected 50.6, the first expansion since February 2015.</p> <p>Meanwhile Japan\u2019s manufacturing PMI also contracted, coming in at 49.3.</p> <p>Shortly come the European and UK figures.</p> <p>In the light of Brexit the UK data will be particularly interesting, ahead of <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/31/uk-interest-rates-set-to-be-cut-bank-of-england-growth-forecasts\">the latest Bank of England decision on Thursday which is expected to see an interest rate cut.</a></strong></p> <p>The initial reading showed<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/22/britains-economy-shrinking-at-fastest-rate-since-2009-says-survey\"> the sharpest downturn in the UK economy since the financial crisis seven years ago,</a></strong> but this may well be revised upwards. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We saw this fall to 49.1 from 52.1... however there is a chance that we could see this revised higher given that the flash number was taken at a time when political uncertainty was at elevated levels. This is no longer the case and this might be reflected in a slightly improved number.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the European and US data, Hewson said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will also be getting the latest July manufacturing PMI numbers for Spain, Italy, France and Germany with slowdowns expected for Spain and Italy to 51.6 and 52.2, while France is expected to stay stuck in contraction at 48.6. German manufacturing is expected to show the strongest reading at 53.7.</p> <p> In the US the latest ISM manufacturing report showed a decent recovery in June to 53.2, and the expectation is that this could well continue into July with a reading of 53.1, which may bode well for this week\u2019s jobs data. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-08-01T06:54:15.170Z\">at 7.54am BST</time></p>  </div>",

In a report that partly uses macroeconomic conditions to predict each country\u2019s performance, the economists said Britain\u2019s medal haul would fall without the boost that countries typically get from home advantage. Team GB will win 23 gold medals \u2013 six fewer than four years ago \u2013 but its tally of other medals will stay the same, sending the total down to 59 from 65, Goldman said. The UK will still be third in the medal rankings behind the US in first place and China in second, Goldman predicted. The US will win one fewer gold medal, but its total will rise by three to 106. China is predicted to pick up two fewer golds with its total rising by one to 89. Brazil will gain from hosting the games, adding five medals, including two golds, to take its total to 22, the company forecast. However, the $10bn spent on infrastructure and logistics to prepare for the games will not be enough to stimulate the $1.8tn Brazilian economy, which is in a deep recession, Goldman said. The biggest loser in medal terms will be Russia, which is embroiled in a doping scandal that will result in many of its athletes being barred. Goldman predicted Russia would win 24 fewer medals than in 2012. The Goldman economists predicted the UK\u2019s medal tally correctly in 2012 and the top 11 nations for total medals won. They admitted beginner\u2019s luck and the randomness of small samples may have played a part in their success. The economists argue that countries with healthy economies and political systems should do better at the games and that \u201ca country is more likely to produce world-class athletes in a world-class environment\u201d. They also look at population size, previous medal success and the effect of hosting the games. The report said: \u201cWithout an in-depth knowledge of elite athletes, recent performance metrics, and event details, it would be surprising if broad econometric exercises based on macroeconomic relationships weren\u2019t only a very rough guide to predicting Olympic success. \u201cStill, the predictive success of our last effort suggests that at least at the level of a country it may be possible to identify the ingredients of winning.\u201d The economists from the world\u2019s top investment bank said their report was meant as a piece of \u201csummer fun\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline has teamed up with Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet to develop miniature electronic implants for the treatment of asthma, diabetes and other chronic conditions. GSK, Britain\u2019s biggest drug company, said it would form a joint venture with Verily Life Sciences, a division of Alphabet, to work on research into bioelectronic medicines. GSK will own 55% of Galvani Bioelectronics, and Verily will hold 45%. Galvani will be based at GSK\u2019s global research and development centre at Stevenage, Hertfordshire, just north of London, and will have a second research hub at Verily\u2019s base in San Francisco. The companies will combine their existing intellectual property rights and invest up to \u00a3540m over seven years if the collaboration meets certain goals. GSK has been working on bioelectronic medicines since 2012 in a push to develop new patentable treatments as its Advair respiratory treatment faces competition from generic versions. It has invested $50m (\u00a338m) in a venture capital fund for bioelectronics and provided funding for scientists outside the company working in the field. Bioelectronic remedies attach battery-powered implants the size of a grain of rice or smaller to individual nerves to correct faulty electrical signals between the nervous system and the body\u2019s organs. GSK believes altering these nerve signals could open up the airways of asthma sufferers, reduce inflammation in the gut from Crohn\u2019s disease and treat patients with a range of other chronic ailments such as arthritis. So far, the implants have only been tested on animals but the aim is to produce treatments that supplement or replace drugs that often come with side-effects. GSK and Verily, renamed from Google Life Sciences in December, said their collaboration would combine GSK\u2019s drug development and understanding of disease biology with Verily\u2019s expertise in miniature electronics, data and software for clinical purposes. The new company will initially employ about 30 scientists, engineers and doctors. Kris Famm, GSK\u2019s head of bioelectronics, said an advantage of bioelectronics would be that researchers should be able to apply it to more diseases as the technology develops. He said working with Verily would speed up this process and that he hoped to conduct the first tests on humans within three years. Famm said: \u201cWe have to figure out how to interface devices with the small nerves in our bodies to find a new way to deliver therapies. We will build the tiny devices that lie at the centre of bringing these treatments to potential. \u201cThe smaller the devices the less they will need to be charged and the more precise they are, and the more attractive this will be as an intervention. Hopefully in 10 years there will be a treatment option where your doctor will say \u2018Why don\u2019t you go for bioelectronic?\u2019, and a surgeon will do a little procedure and it will help the organ to do what it should be doing.\u201d Moncef Slaoui, GSK\u2019s chairman of global vaccines, will chair the new company\u2019s board, which will also include Verily\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Conrad, and Famm. Galvani will be named after Luigi Aloisio Galvani, an 18th-century scientist whose study of a frog\u2019s reactions paved the way for the study of neuroscience. The companies hope the joint venture will be in operation by the end of this year once it has been approved by US competition regulators. GSK said last week it would invest \u00a3275m in its UK operations and that Britain remained a good place to do business despite the vote to leave the EU. The company\u2019s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, is due to leave in March 2017, making the Galvani venture one of his last deals at the company. Verily is one of Alphabet\u2019s most important long-term ventures. It is part of the tech giant\u2019s lossmaking \u201cother bets\u201d division that also includes Nest, which develops household products connected to the internet. Brian Otis, Verily\u2019s chief technology officer, said: \u201cThis is an ambitious collaboration allowing GSK and Verily to combine forces and have a huge impact on an emerging field. Bioelectronic medicine is a new area of therapeutic exploration, and we know that success will require the confluence of deep disease biology expertise and new highly miniaturised technologies.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>GlaxoSmithKline has teamed up with Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet to develop miniature electronic implants for the treatment of asthma, diabetes and other chronic conditions.</p> <p>GSK, Britain\u2019s biggest drug company, said it would form a joint venture with Verily Life Sciences, a division of Alphabet, to work on research into bioelectronic medicines. GSK will own 55% of Galvani Bioelectronics, and Verily will hold 45%.</p> <p>Galvani will be based at GSK\u2019s global research and development centre at Stevenage, Hertfordshire, just north of London, and will have a second research hub at Verily\u2019s base in San Francisco. The companies will combine their existing intellectual property rights and invest up to \u00a3540m over seven years if the collaboration meets certain goals.</p> <p>GSK has been working on bioelectronic medicines since 2012 in a push to develop new patentable treatments as its Advair respiratory treatment faces competition from generic versions. It has invested $50m (\u00a338m) in a venture capital fund for bioelectronics and provided funding for scientists outside the company working in the field.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/google-alphabet-gsk-forays-biotechnology\">Dr Google will see you now: Alphabet's forays into biotechnology</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bioelectronic remedies attach battery-powered implants the size of a grain of rice or smaller to individual nerves to correct faulty electrical signals between the nervous system and the body\u2019s organs.</p> <p>GSK believes altering these nerve signals could open up the airways of asthma sufferers, reduce inflammation in the gut from Crohn\u2019s disease and treat patients with a range of other chronic ailments such as arthritis. So far, the implants have only been tested on animals but the aim is to produce treatments that supplement or replace drugs that often come with side-effects.</p> <p>GSK and Verily, renamed from Google Life Sciences in December, said their collaboration would combine GSK\u2019s drug development and understanding of disease biology with Verily\u2019s expertise in miniature electronics, data and software for clinical purposes. The new company will initially employ about 30 scientists, engineers and doctors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a361b3b23331a833cfd064b2f2cf27871b195ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a361b3b23331a833cfd064b2f2cf27871b195ba/0_139_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An artist\u2019s impression of a closeup of a bioelectronic implant \u201ccuff\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An artist\u2019s impression of a closeup of a bioelectronic implant \u2018cuff\u2019 wrapped around a bundle of nerves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GSK/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kris Famm, GSK\u2019s head of bioelectronics, said an advantage of bioelectronics would be that researchers should be able to apply it to more diseases as the technology develops. He said working with Verily would speed up this process and that he hoped to conduct the first tests on humans within three years.</p> <p>Famm said: \u201cWe have to figure out how to interface devices with the small nerves in our bodies to find a new way to deliver therapies. We will build the tiny devices that lie at the centre of bringing these treatments to potential. </p> <p>\u201cThe smaller the devices the less they will need to be charged and the more precise they are, and the more attractive this will be as an intervention. Hopefully in 10 years there will be a treatment option where your doctor will say \u2018Why don\u2019t you go for bioelectronic?\u2019, and a surgeon will do a little procedure and it will help the organ to do what it should be doing.\u201d</p> <p>Moncef Slaoui, GSK\u2019s chairman of global vaccines, will chair the new company\u2019s board, which will also include Verily\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Conrad, and Famm. </p> <p>Galvani will be named after Luigi Aloisio Galvani, an 18th-century scientist whose study of a frog\u2019s reactions paved the way for the study of neuroscience.
