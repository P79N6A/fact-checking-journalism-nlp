    "webTitle": "It's goodbye to Mervyn King, but not to the slump", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In his valedictory appearance before MPs as governor of the Bank of England on Tuesday, Sir Mervyn King warned that a sustainable recovery is still a distant prospect, despite signs that the economy is returning to health. Growth will be weak and interest rates will remain at ultra-low levels until global policymakers grapple with the underlying problems created by the banking crash, he said. King, who will hand over to his successor, Mark Carney, on Monday, dismissed calls for a speedy return to \"normal interest rates\", which have grown louder in recent months after the economy avoided a triple-dip recession. Instead, he criticised governments for failing to take advantage of the opportunity offered by massive money-printing programmes to rebalance their economies. \"Until markets see in place policies to bring about that return to normal economic conditions, there is no prospect for sustainable recovery, and without that prospect for sustainable recovery, markets understand that it will not be sensible to return interest rates to normal levels,\" he said. When asked by Tory MP Andrea Leadsom if governments had \"blown\" the window created over the past five years, King said they had \"failed to take advantage of the time we have created\". He added: \"They haven't blown it yet \u2013 there's still time.\" King was giving evidence to the Treasury select committee before his retirement at the end of the week and his replacement by Carney, the outgoing governor of Canada's central bank. Carney will take over against a backdrop of falling stock markets and increased borrowing costs for indebted governments. Markets were spooked earlier this month by concerns that within months, the US Federal Reserve will begin winding down its $85bn (\u00a355bn) a month quantitative easing programme, where it pumps cash into the economy by acquiring its own debt from financial institutions. The Fed, alongside the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, has pumped more than $3tn into the global economy, largely by purchasing government bonds to offset a collapse in credit that followed the financial crash in 2008. Rattled investors have interpreted remarks on a QE slowdown by the Fed's chairman, Ben Bernanke, as a sign that higher interest rates are around the corner, with a knock-on effect on global growth. King told MPs that markets had \"jumped the gun\" in betting that interest rates will go back to higher levels in the near future, from 0.5% in the UK. He said Bernanke had been clear when he talked about tapering the stimulus to the US economy. Bernanke \"certainly wasn't announcing the end of QE\", King said, adding: \"Certainly I think the view that we are definitely at the beginning of the end, that we are definitely at the point where we need to raise interest rates, I think is a premature judgment about where we are and no central bank has moved rapidly down that course. The Federal Reserve has merely said that the easing in which it is still engaging may taper at some point depending on economic conditions.\" He added: \"People have rather jumped the gun thinking this means an imminent return to normal levels of interest rates. It doesn't.\" King warned homeowners in their 30s and 40s they might be in an \"unsustainable position\" if interest rates return soon to normal levels. He said: \"If there are changes around the world that lead long-term interest rates to go up \u2013 it's unlikely, but if they do go back up quickly \u2013 then some of those households will have levels of debt that won't look so attractive given the new lower level of house prices.\" King also raised concerns over bank lobbying and bemoaned the \"disaster\" of austerity in some parts of the eurozone. He said politicians and officials had \"clearly come under tremendous pressure themselves from banks. They've been lobbied,\" he said. \"They have passed on concerns \u2026 various conversations have taken place with others and I think it is very important that people simply should say if they are lobbied. There were certainly calls made to No 11 and even in some cases to No 10 to try to put pressure on supervisors to modify, be more reasonable in their judgment.\" The chairman of the committee, Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, reacted furiously to the claim that the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), which oversees the banking industry, and ministers were under pressure to tear up the rule book for some banks. \"Pressure has been brought to bear on the PRA, as a result of calls by the banks to No 10 and No 11. The governor said that this should not happen. It is essential that the chancellor look into this and give us reassurance. Representations of the views of banks are desirable. Attempts to influence the independent regulator are unacceptable,\" he said. George Osborne said on Tuesday night: \"If there's unacceptable pressure, I absolutely say that is not acceptable. The PRA is completely independent and it's made its independent decisions on capital in our banks. We empower our regulators to do their job. \"Of course, banks, consumer groups, anyone else can make their case. But ultimately it's an independent body that makes the judgment.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Down 6% in the morning, up 6% in the afternoon. The wild ride in the Chinese stock market on Tuesday tells the tale of confusion about the depth of the China's credit crunch and the authorities' ability to control events. The trigger for the afternoon rebound was comments from the central bank that it would guide interest rates to \"reasonable levels\" and that cash in the financial system would be managed flexibly. In normal circumstances, such a statement would be regarded as woefully vague, almost meaningless. But the People's Bank of China traditionally runs its communications in a near-vacuum. Two statements in two days counts as an outbreak of verbosity. Investors took that as reassuring evidence that the authorities are at least aware of the risks as they attempt to defuse a credit boom. Well, it's something to cling to. Confidence, however, looks fragile. The big problem is the scale of the ramp-up in credit in recent years. Fitch, the credit ratings agency, has calculated that the total lending in the $7.3tn (\u00a34.7tn) Chinese economy reached almost 200% of economic output last year, up from 125% five years earlier. That rate of explosive growth can be dangerous. History is littered with example of economic blow-ups and banking crises that followed massive increases in lending \u2013 Japan in the late 1980s, most famously. China's recent credit explosion started in 2009, when Beijing reacted to the west's banking bust and recession by ordering a massive programme of investment, principally in public infrastructure, offices and flats. That succeeded in restoring strong growth to the economy \u2013 and, indeed, helped to prevent a bigger global downturn. But, for the bears, the critical point is that the Chinese credit boom never slowed down: the skyscrapers and flats continued to be built before demand could catch up. \"The excess borrowing that occurred in 2009 has never been absorbed by the real economy and now more borrowing is being piled on top of this,\" said Wei Yao, an analyst at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale bank, earlier this month. She thinks \"the debt snowball is getting bigger and bigger, without contributing to real activity\" and suspects many borrowers are rolling over loans at punitive rates in a desperate struggle to stay in the game. SocGen's chart shows where the credit has come from \u2013 most of the extra lending is not being made by mainstream banks but by the so-called \"shadow banking\" system, which largely means small finance houses that have often funded speculative property projects. Beijing has traditionally tolerated the shadow banks. They are viewed as an essential part of a financial system that is steadily liberalising, even if they have also become a way for state-backed banks themselves to bypass official lending caps. But it was these shadow lenders that the People's Bank of China seemed to want to punish last week. Short-term lending rates between banks were allowed to soar \u2013 to 11% for one-week money. The official message seemed blunt: rein it in, apply discipline, and don't assume the state is always on hand to keep interest rates low. Having made its point, then central bank then managed rates back downwards, albeit not all the way down. Beijing's mission seems reasonable enough \u2013 if there is excess credit in the Chinese economy, it's better to tackle the problem before a bigger bubble is blown. Mark Williams of thinktank Capital Economics comments: \"The episode is arguably the strongest sign yet that the leadership is willing to suffer short-term economic pain if necessary to achieve more sustainable growth.\" But Williams also calls the People's Bank's behaviour \"extraordinarily reckless\" since it offered no explanation for its initial inaction. Indeed. It's all very well to have a policy but surely it's better to communicate it. The risk is that confidence is damaged. What's more, shock and awe tactics look ill-suited to the delicate task of finessing investment away from unprofitable property projects while simultaneously keeping the economy stable. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's analysts think the biggest risk lies in the central bank mishandling the situation. \"In our view, dealing with banks in breach of regulations should be done by improving prudential regulations rather than engineering an interbank credit crunch which could potentially backfire should banks lose mutual trust,\" they said. Viewed from outside, China's building boom also looks to rely on inherently shaky financial structures. The shadow banks attract cash in short-term products from middle-class savers keen to escape the low deposit rates on offer at state-sponsored banks. But then they lend to long-term illiquid building projects. In a full-brown credit crunch, they would be horribly exposed. We would also see the first test of how far Beijing is willing to go to protect the shadow banks. \"I would say the [Chinese] authorities have the situation well in hand,\" said incoming Bank of England governor Mark Carney. For now, that's the consensus view. While economists are busy trimming their forecasts of GDP growth \u2013 Goldman Sachs now expects the economy to grow 7.7% in 2014, not 8.4% \u2013 they are also praising China for acting early to prevent a bigger debt crisis. The alternative view is that China has left it late to rein in the credit boom without risking a major slump. If Wei Yao at SocGen is right about the chronic problem of over-extended corporate borrowers, there are lots of bad debts that haven't been recognised. In the past, recapitalising banks has never a problem for China \u2013 but the economy's new reliance on shadow banks and hazy specialist financing vehicles makes events harder to predict. Given the size of the building boom, is it even possible to estimate accurately the accumulation of bad loans in the system? China will also have to attempt the trick against an uncertain global backdrop. The US economy is growing but not everybody is convinced the recovery can withstand higher interest rates. In the meantime, recession rumbles on in the eurozone. But Beijing seems to have decided the country's credit pains have to be confronted anyway. After 12 years of boom, Chinese-style capitalism faces its biggest test \u2013 how to apply the brakes without crashing.",

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. Here's a brief closing summary: \u2022 Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has told his new cabinet that they must meet the targets set with the Troika, if Greece is to avoid even more austerity. Samaras also made growth, employment and stability the priorities as he looked to grab the political momentum back after the turmoil caused by the closure of state broadcaster ERT. Details at 12.19 and 1.29pm \u2022 But as our Athens correspondent Helena Smith points out, simply changing the ministers won't end Greece's long recession, or help it comply with its tough bailout programm. Analysis from Helena is at 4.22pm. \u2022 Spain and Italy saw their borrowing costs jump, at debt sales today. Analyst Nick Spiro warned that the peripheral bond market was feeling the heat after recent turbulence (see 11.18am) \u2022 Stock markets have recovered some of yesterday losses. Closing prices at 5.55pm. \u2022 The markets were calmed by reassuring words from the Chinese central bank, which promised to help banks who were short of liquidity as it continued its clampdown on the shadow banking sector (see 8.47am and 4.40pm). \u2022 Strong US data also showed that the American economy continues to recover, with a jump in consumer confidence, house prices and durable goods sales (see 1.39pm onwards). \u2022 The scandal in Ireland over secret tape recordings of the management of Anglo Irish bank continued. The latest revelations showed senior managers singing \"Deutschland, Deutschland, \u00fcber alles\" as they secured help from Europe (see 4.54pm onwards). I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks and goodnight. GW On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 is up 1% while the Dow is 0.7% higher David Jones of IG Index reckons it's a lacklustre response to the news today that US house prices rose at their highest rate since summer 2008, with consumer confidence at a record high: Today\u2019s avalanche of US data has done little to put the fight back into Wall Street, which is currently struggling to show much enthusiasm for a meaningful rally. Almost everything was better than expected, but even this burst of good news couldn\u2019t tempt the bulls out of hiding. It appears that, far from being the \u2018feral hogs\u2019 suggested by the Fed\u2019s Richard Fisher, investors are just trying to do the same thing as the Fed, looking at each piece of news and working out where it fits in the great jigsaw puzzle of global equity markets. Europe's stock markets ended the day higher, buoyed by soothing words from central bankers through the day, and decent US data this afternoon. A few weeks ago, strong US consumer confidence data, house price figures and durable goods sales would probably have sent the markets falling as traders anticipated its impact on the US stimulus package. Now that the Federal Reserve has laid out its position, perhaps data can be taken on its merits. Having said that, today's rally isn't terribly strong (indeed, shares fell again in Italy). Here's the closing prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 72 points at 6101, + 1.2% \u2022 German GAX: up 118 points at 7811, +1,55% \u2022 French CAC: up 54 points at 3649, +1.5% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 54.5 points at 7607, +0.7% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 55 points at 15056, -0.37% Irish Premier Enda Kenny has now confirmed that the Irish police have had the Anglo Irish Bank tapes for four years, Henry McDonald reports. He told the Dail this evening that the Garda\u00ed were in possession of the tapes and that they had been originally handed over to the force four years ago when they began their criminal investigations into the running of the bank. A Garda spokesman had earlier refused to say if the force has been in possession of the Anglo Irish tapes for four years. The Garda investigation into the bank has become of the most complex in Irish criminal history. Detectives are having to trawl through more than one million emails and documents since the bank was nationalised four years ago. Sources in Dublin said the material includes the taped conversations that has caused national outrage in the Republic. The Anglo Irish Bank tape scandal which broke yesterday has deepenened after it emerged that executives at the stricken bank sung \"Deutschland, Deutschland, \u00fcber alles\" as they secured a state guarantee for their bank deposits. Fresh tape recordings released today have shown senior managers joking about how financial help from Germany was flowing their way, a day after the Irish Independent produced evidence that Anglo had deliberately low-balled the cost of its bailout. Our Dublin correspondent, Henry McDonald, reports: The bankers are heard joking and singing as the bank's then chief executive, David Drumm, urges his executives to \"get the fucking money in\" in September 2008, when the state stepped in. The Irish government had intervened that month with a guarantee of the bank's deposits to keep the institution afloat \u2013 a move that angered London and Berlin because it enticed money from British and German savers. The latest recordings to be leaked from inside the bank will compound national outrage in Ireland over the behaviour of Anglo Irish bankers. One senior executive, then director of capital markets, John Bowe, was recorded boasting that he had picked a random figure of \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn) \"out of my arse\" as the cost of the state rescuing them. Here's Henry's full story: Anglo Irish Bank tapes: executives mock Germans amid bailout And here's Monday's story: Ireland's rage justified \u2013 Enda Kenny Missed this earlier today, but the Financial Times has published more details of the statement issued by China's central bank. It explains how the People's Bank of China promised more support for the country's financial institutions if they hit liquidity problems: PBOC said: If banks have temporary shortages in their planned funding, the central bank will give them liquidity support If institutions have problems in managing their liquidity, the central bank will apply appropriate measures under the circumstances to maintain the overall stability of money markets. More here. From Athens, our correspondent Helena Smith writes: Another year. Another government reshuffle. Overseeing his first cabinet meeting today \u2013 his ministers smiling like school children on their first day -- Prime Minister Antonis Samaras rammed home the message that there was \u201cnot a minute to lose.\u201d If Greece is to be spared yet more austerity, and the turmoil that would inevitably entail, the new government will have to work around-the-clock, no Sundays, no holidays, no leisure time at all. We have, of course, heard this before uttered from the lips of every leader since the eruption of Greece\u2019s great economic crisis. On the ground, at least, Greeks may be forgiven for believing that the real truth lies not so much in the notion of hard labour but the rules of the game being changed altogether. Whichever way you look at them the numbers still don\u2019t add up. The make-over will buy time in what, anyway, is likely to be a slow motion summer in the run-up to late September\u2019s German election \u2013 but it unlikely to keep drama at bay. For many, the government is still doomed to fail precisely because the problems the country now faces \u2013 economically, politically and socially \u2013 are too big to tackle. With the departure of the small Democratic Left (Dimar) from the alliance, the government has lost the pretext it once had not to press ahead with pressing reforms, starting with lay-offs in the public sector. Similarly, there will be little excuse not to pull off a slew of privatisations in the months ahead. Placing Kykiakos Mitsotakis at the helm of the Administrative Reform ministry (a key post for Athens\u2019 troika of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF) was a stroke of genius. An energetic liberal, Mitsotakis is one of the brightest members of the new cabinet and an ardent advocate of reform. Putting Pandelis Kapsis at the helm of a new ministry that will overhaul the state broadcaster, ERT, is also an inspired move. Pragmatic, honest and urbane no one in Athens is more aware of the shortcomings of the Greek media scene than the former newspaper editor. In terms of the mechanics of power, the socialist Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos undoubtedly emerges as the big winner. From his new post as deputy prime minister (and foreign minister) he will have much greater control of the internal workings of the government. But the enforced compromise that has also come with the balancing act of putting two parties in a power-sharing arrangement has also placed a patina of weakness over this government. None more so than the appointment of two lightweights to the very portfolios \u2013 the ministries of health and labour \u2013 that account for two thirds of the budget deficit and are the bane of all economic policy making in Greece. Handy advice for those of you in the markets: A third piece of strong American data today: consumer confidence has soared ahead in June to a five-year high, leaving analyst forecasts in the dust. The Conference Board reported that US consumer confidence jumped to 81.4 on its index, up from 74.3 in May (slightly revised lowed). That suggests Americans are more positive about conditions in the business sector and the labour market than at any time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers. With house prices (2.18pm) and durable goods orders (1.39pm) also up today, the broad picture is that America's economy is recovering. There are fears, of course, that the fiscal cutbacks this year could derail it (thus the IMF's call this month for the 'sequester' to be scrapped). But analysts are quite optimistic. Here's Capital Economics' take on the 3.6% jump in durable orders: While the 3.6% m/m jump in durable goods orders in May was mainly due to a 51% m/m rebound in volatile commercial aircraft orders, the rest of the report was relatively upbeat. Even if second-quarter business investment growth turns out to be trivial, the third quarter should be better. Wall Street is open, and shares are rallying on the back of today's strong US data and the calming words from Mario Draghi (2pm), Sir Mervyn King (12.01pm), and China's central bank (8.47am). The Dow Jones is up around 0.75% in early trading, gaining 109 points to 14766. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are showing similar gains. And that's helping to support other markets, with the European stock markets up by at least 1%, Here's the latest prices: More strong US data. American house prices have risen by 12.1% over the last 12 months, the biggest annual gain since March 2006. The S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, which tracks prices in 20 cities, also found that prices jumped 2.5% in April alone (stripping out seasonal adjustments). That's the biggest month-on-month rise in the survey's history. David M. Blitzer, who chairs the S&amp;P committee, said the recovery was 'definitely broad-based': Atlanta, Las Vegas, Phoenix and San Francisco posted year-over-year gains of over 20% in April. San Francisco was the highest at 23.9%. Phoenix posted 12 consecutive months of double-digit growth. Recent economic data on home sales and inventories confirm the housing recovery\u2019s strength. ECB president Mario Draghi has become the latest central banker to pour soothing words over the financial markets today, following Sir Mervyn King (12.01) and the People's Bank of China (8.47am). Draghi insisted the ECB was nowhere close to tightening its accomodative monetary policy, given the current record jobless levels and subdued inflation. Speaking at an event in Berlin, Draghi said: In terms of monetary policy, price stability is assured, and the overall economic outlook still warrants an accommodative stance, the exit from which by the way is still distant since inflation is low and unemployment (is) high. Draghi also cited his OMT (Outright Monetary Transactions) bond-buying programme. He said (not for the first time) it had delivered substantial benefits by driving down bond yields and encouraging deposits back to peripheral banks. OMT is even more vital today than a year ago when it was announced, Draghi suggested, given developments elsewhere in the global economy: Because of OMT, the euro area is a more stable and resilient place to invest in than it was a year ago. Indeed, I would say that OMT is even more essential now as we see potential changes in the monetary policy stance with associated uncertainty in other jurisdictions of the integrated global economy. Presumably he's thinking of the Federal Reserve..... The full text of Draghi's speech is here: Stable Euro, Strong Europe. The ECB tweeted some other highlights: Decent economic data from America -- durable goods orders rose by 3.6% in May, which is slightly better thatn expected. April's figure has also been revised a little higher (from 3.5% to 3.6%). That may suggest the Federal Reserve is on the money when it predicted last week that the US economy was recovering. Associated Press confirms that Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras stressed the need for stability and unity as he addressed his new cabinet this afternoon (as covered at 12.19pm). Here's AP's take: \"Stability is today more necessary than ever,\" Samaras told his ministers in the new cabinet's first meeting, held immediately after the swearing-in ceremony. \"This government doesn't have a moment to lose.\" And as I flagged up earlier, the rejigged government must swiftly conclude negotiations with its international creditors when Troika officials return to the country, probably in the next few days. Here's more from AP: Structural reforms, achieving a primary surplus a budget surplus without taking into account interest on outstanding loans and preparing the country to hold the European Union's rotating six-month presidency next year were among the government's top priorities, he said. Samaras also insisted the coalition government's aim \"was from the start, and continues to be, the exhaustion of its four-year term.\" Other priorities included bringing down unemployment, which has reached a record higher above 27 percent, and supporting the more vulnerable segments of society, he said. In the bond markets, Italy's government debt is dropping in value again this lunchtime. That follows this morning's auction of two-year bonds, which saw buyers demand higher rates of return (see 11.18am for details) The yield (or interest rate) on Italian 10-year bonds has risen to 4.85% so far today, up from 4.8% on Monday night. A small enough move, but it takes Italy's benchmark yield closer to the highest point of the year (4.91% in February). As this graph shows, there's been a rapid change since the Fed's press conference last Wednesday night (when Ben Bernanke suggested America's bond-buying stimulus might end by next summer) If the trend continues, Italian 10-year bonds will be yielding more than 5% again - a point Spain reached yesterday, and is clinging onto today. Safer sovereign bonds have strenthened slightly today, amid calming words from the central banks of China and the UK today. Here's the key 10-year bond yields: \u2022 Spain: flat at 5.04% \u2022 Italy: up 5 basis points (0.05%) at 4.85% \u2022 Greece: down 14bp at 11.49% \u2022 Portugal: up 9bp at 6.91% \u2022 UK: down 10bp at 2.46% \u2022 US: down 5bp at 2.49% \u2022 Germany: down 4bp at 1.77% \u2022 France: down 3bp at 2.42% Greece's prime minister has told his new cabinet that there is no time to waste if they are to avoid having to impose further austerity measures. Speaking after ministers were sworn in this morning, Antonis Samaras said his government's top priorities are to get the Greek economy growing again and hit the targets agreed with international lenders. Samaras told the first meeting of the new cabinet that there was no time to lose: Our immediate priority is to return to recovery ahead of time, defeat unemployment, bring in investment, avoid new measures and create jobs for the youth. We have no choice but to succeed and we are determined to succeed. With his majority now down to 153 (out of 300), Samaras said his government must take 'stable steps', with everyone pulling in the same direction. As he put it: Each of us has his own political beliefs but the overriding ideology right now is saving the country. As explained at 8.05am, the soclalist Pasok party has been given more cabinet seats following the withdrawal of the other junior partner, Democratic Left, last week. Last week, Greece's Troika of lenders suspended their assessment of the Greek economy, but they're due to resume work by the end of June. That review will determine whether Greece is still meeting its commitments. Just in, a couple of photos from the Greek cabinet swearing-in: Here's my colleague Katie Allen's report on Sir Mervyn King's appearance at the Treasury select committee today: Interest rate rises not imminent, says Sir Mervyn King Here's a flavour: Global markets have \"jumped the gun\" in betting that interest rates will go back to normal levels anytime soon, outgoing Bank of England governor Mervyn King warned as he reacted to the widespread sell-off following Federal Reserve comments last week. Speaking at his last hearing with the all-party Treasury committee, outgoing governor King raised concerns over bank lobbying and bemoaned the \"disaster\" of austerity in some parts of the eurozone. He advised his successor, the Canadian Mark Carney, to be \"true to himself\" Spain's economy minister Luis de Guindos has predicted that the country's unemployment crisis is easing (our correspondent in Madrid, Martin Roberts, reports). De Guindos said the next batch of quarterly unemployment figures would be \"much better\" than a record 6.2 million reached in the first three months of the year, equivalent to 27.2% of the working population or the second highest rate in the EU. In a keynote speech to a business conference in Madrid, de Guindos said: (The data) will show that there is effective job recovery and falling unemployment which goes beyond seasonal effects. The number of those registered as unemployed fell by 2% in May to 4.9 million, but that does not include the long-term jobless in a country where benefits last two years at most. The minister also expected the economy, which has been contracting since mid-2011, to begin to turn around in the second quarter, and be close to zero after falling by 0.5% between January and March, adding: ...and the possibility of growth in the third quarter is not far-fetched. The government forecasts Spain's economy will shrink by 1.3% during 2013 as a whole, and to grow by 0.5% next year. De Guindos added. The question today is not whether the Spanish economy will recover, but how firm the recovery will be, how firm the exit from the recession we are in. One last highlight from Sir Mervyn King's farewell skit at the Treasury select committee. Challenged about his support for austerity, the outgoing governor said he had never backed fiscal cutbacks on their own, insisting: Austerity in countries who have no other way to generate growth has been a disaster. The evidence could be seen in parts of the eurozone, King added. Italy and Spain both saw their borrowing costs rise at debt auctions this morning, raising fears that the market turbulence is hitting the eurozone's weaker members. Spain sold \u20ac930m of three-month bills at average yield (or interest rate) of 0.869%, up from 0.331% at the last auction, and \u20ac2.14bn of nine-month bills at yields of 1.441%, up from 0.789%. Demand for the 3-month bills was down sharply (a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.9 vs 4.3), but the Spanish Treasury did receive slightly more bids for the longer-dated bills than last time (it was 2.4 times over-subscribed from 2.2 last time). Italy also saw its borrowing costs jump at an auction of \u20ac3.5bn of two-year bonds. Buyers of the debt demanded yields of 2.4%, up from a eurozone-era record low of 1.1% last time. That's an important point -- Spain and Italy had seen their borrowing costs fall steadily this year, thanks to central bank stimulus measures and the European Central Bank's promise to buy the bonds of countries in distress (if they signed up for reforms). But bond analyst Nick Spiro, of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, says peripheral eurozone government debt markets have entered \"a much more volatile phase\", now that the Federal Reserve is planning to scale back its bond-buying. Spiro explains: Confidence in the central bank \"put\", the main pillar of support for Italian and Spanish bonds, has been badly shaken. The fortunes of Italy's bond market now hinge on investor perceptions of the credibility of US monetary policy as opposed to the ECB's policy actions. Today's Italian sale underrscores \"the growing fears about the adverse consequences of a withdrawal of liquidity\", Spiro explains. The other factor in Italy, of course, is the seven-year jail term and public office ban imposed on Silvio Berlusconi yesterday. The former PM is appealing (so to speak), but it puts more pressure on Italy's fragile coalition government. As Spiro puts it: On the domestic front, Mr Berlusconi's conviction adds another layer of political risk at a time when the Letta government is deeply divided over fiscal policy and Italy's economy remains mired in recession. Further pressure on Italy's bond market will inflame political tensions, with Mr Berlusconi's PdL heaping more pressure on Mr Letta to take a tougher line with Germany and the ECB. Greece's president, Karolos Papoulias, is just beginning the swearing-in of the new Greek cabinet (see 8.05am for details). Shares are continuing to push higher this morning, with the FTSE 100 now up 50 points at 6079. But the mood in the City remains very cautious, given fears over China's economy and the looming withdrawal of the Federal Reserve's stimulus. Here's a round-up of the latest chat this morning; Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets: Substantial intraday swings in the major indices have been a feature of the market correction we\u2019ve seen over the past few weeks, as the bull/bear debate rages over proposed Fed tapering, a potential Chinese slow down and the consequences for medium-term equity valuations. In the context of these moves this morning\u2019s bounce is being viewed with suspicion in some quarters, with many traders awaiting the next leg down in what they see as an inevitable continuation of the correction. Rupert Osborne, futures dealer at IG: It seems that the rush for the exits has come to a halt for now, but, like the proverbial parrot, this bout of risk aversion may not be dead, but just resting. It is still a struggle to work out the real outlook for markets, since the dust kicked up by last week\u2019s Fed meeting will take weeks to settle. The Fed might be supposed to remain aloof from market panic, but it cannot have escaped them that the reaction to their upcoming policy changes has been less than positive. The FTSE 100\u2019s 6000 level has held for now, which will come as relief to many who had watched the markets press relentlessly lower over the past month. Both banks and miners are in better form so far this morning, looking to take back some of their China-inspired losses. A rally of a thousand points begins with a single step, but it would take a brave person to suggest that the bottom is now in and that the only way is up once again. A few highlights from Sir Mervyn King's final appearance at parliament as Bank of England governor. King took a pop at Britain's commercial banks, saying they had put \"tremendous pressure\" on Bank officials and the government in an attempt to water down regulations. \"At least one call took place\" to the Treasury, King claimed. The recent market turbulence was raised. Ben Broadbent, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee, said the market reaction to Ben Bernanke's statement last week was 'not predictable', and showed how cautious central bankers must be about unwinding stimulus packages. King said that there was no real chance of interest rates returning to 'normal levels' anytime soon, as the world has not yet returned to normal market conditions. Martin Weale, another MPC policymaker, agreed, saying: I certainly think it would be quite wrong to try and give any timetable for any sort of return to a more normal pattern of interest rates. Live coverage in Andy Sparrow's live blog, The next governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has offered his support to China over its shadow banking clampdown. Discussing the recent market volatility, Carney told reporters that: I would say the authorities have the situation well in hand. Carney was speaking after the latest meeting of the Financial Stability Board, which sets rules for global banks, and which he chairs. The FSB's meeting included a discussion of liquidity developments in all major global markets, so China's liquidity squeeze was probably high on the list. The FSB also announced a task force would review Libor, following the recent scandal involving traders manipulating the rate. Carney siad the steering group would report back next year on whether the benchmark should be changed, and when. Carney told the press conference: What has to be taken into account is the robustness of the standard. We have to recognize that even some transactions benchmarks could be manipulated, it depends on depth of the market. (quotes via Reuters). Sir Mervyn King is beginning his final appearance at the Treasury Committee - and our politics live blogger, Andy Sparrow, is going to cover the full action in his liveblog: Sir Mervyn King's final appearance at Treasury committee: Politics live blog And if you'd like to watch it: It's being live-streamed here. City analysts are somewhat confused about what the China's central bank actually announced at its press conference (8.47am). Still, the pledge to 'guide market rates' and provide 'appropriate liquidity management' is being taken as an encouraging sign. After yesterday's heavy selloff, European stock markets are recovering this morning. There's relief that China's central bank has pledged to handle its liquidity squeeze responsibly (see 8.47am), and predicted that the recent volatility will calm down once 'seasonal factors' fade. The installation of a new Greek cabinet should calm fears that the country's government might collapse (see 8.05am). Here's the early prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: up 26 points at 6056, +0.45% \u2022 German DAX: up 71 point at 7764, + 0.94% \u2022 France's CAC: up 38 points at 3633, +1% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 95 points at 15206, +0.6% \u2022 Spain's IBEX: up 53 points at 7607, +0.7% Not a strong recovery -- and traders still appear somewhat cowed by recent events. The FTSE 100, for example, is down almost 800 points, or 11%, since May 22. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, explains: After a week of truly horrific returns, investors had really started to feel the pain with both equity and bond markets racing towards bear territory. At one stage overnight, it looked likely that the markets would continue their extensive fall, but Chinese equity markets pared back almost all of their overnight losses and European markets have opened higher. However, it is the commodities sector which remains the focus of attention. The recent policy changes in China are a nightmare for the sector and it is likely that volatility will remain high until there is clear direction from Chinese authorities. China's central bank has just held a press conference at which it pledged to manage liquidity in the Chinese financial sector in a 'flexible' manner. The briefing looks like an attempt to calm nerves over the situation in China. It comes after days of wild market moves in the stock market and the 'interbank market' (where banks lend to each other), amid the clampdown on credit and the shadow banking sector. Reuters has the details: China's central bank said on Tuesday that it would guide market rates to reasonable levels, and it expected seasonal factors that caused a recent spike in interbank market rates would gradually fade. Appropriate liquidity management will help maintain reasonable growth in China's money and total social financing, and the People's Bank of China will manage liquidity in a flexible manner, Ling Tao, vice head of the central bank's Shanghai branch, told reporters in a news briefing for a financial forum in the city. Short-term cash rates had soared last week after the People's Bank of China (PBOC) allowed funding to tighten in an apparent effort to curb credit channeled into China's vast \"shadow banking\" system. China's main stock index, the CSI300, closed down 0.3% a few minutes ago. But that doesn't begin to convey what a dramatic session it was. Shares tumbled through the morning, showing ongoing fears over the government's clampdown on liquidity, reckless lending and shadow bank in the Chinese financial sector. But from more than 5% down, the CSI 300 then recovered on rumours that the country's central bank would hold a press conference after the market closed. That press conference is taking place right now. Details to follow..... Greek newspaper Kathimerini calls the shake-up in Greece a 'broad reshuffle', with key posts for the junior Pasok party: The government announced a broad reshuffle on Monday night, just a few days after the junior coalition partner pulled out of the administration, with PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos assuming the dual role of deputy prime minister and foreign minister, conservative New Democracy\u2019s Kyriakos Mitsotakis taking on the tough task of administrative reform, while Yannis Stournaras kept his post as finance minister, as expected. The new cabinet, which includes several members of PASOK in ministerial and deputy ministerial posts, is to be sworn in at 12.30 p.m. on Tuesday in a ceremony to be presided over by President Karolos Papoulias. More from Kathimerini here. While Greek Reporter points out that the both Antonis Samaras and Venizelos have changed their positions: After repeatedly vowing he would not do so, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has shaken up his cabinet to reward PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos, his remaining partner, with the key posts of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, as well as giving the Socialists other top jobs. Venizelos, who last year refused to allow any of his members to join a shaky coalition that then included the tiny Democratic Left (DIMAR) out of apparent fear the government wouldn\u2019t last in the face of unrelenting austerity measures, changed his stance after backing a decision by Samaras, the New Democracy Conservative leader to shut down the national broadcaster ERT and fire all 2,656 workers to satisfy international lenders. Here's Greek Reporter's full story. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. It looks like a lively day ahead, with the Greek cabinet being reshuffled, the markets lively as ever, and Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King giving his last public appearance before standing down. In Athens, a new cabinet is being sworn in at lunchtime as prime minister Antonis Samaras tries to put the disorder caused by the closure of Greece's state broadcaster behind him. Details of the reshuffle emerged last night, and the new team should be sworn in at 12.30pm local time (10.30am BST). As we'd suspected, the socialist Pasok party (now the only junior member of the coalition) gets more responsibility with leader Evangelos Venizelos becoming foreign minister and deputy PM. Two other Pasok leading players, Yiannis Maniatis and Michalis Chrysochoidis, get Environment and Transport Ministry. There's no change at the top of the finance ministry, though, with Yannis Stournaras remaining as finance minister. The reshuffle is meant to stitch the government more closely together, after Samaras was blasted a high-handed approach to his junior partners (one of whom, Democratic Left, has had enough and quit last week). But with the coalition only holding 153 seats (out of 300), the key question is whether Samaras and Venizelos can keep their teams onside. The reshuffle has already provoked some confusion. New Democracy\u2019s Sophia Voultepsi was briefly reported to have taken the Deputy Health Minister brief, before declining it for 'personal reasons'. And the appointment of conservative MP Adonis Georgiadis to the Health Ministry also raised eyebrows, given his previous support for an anti-semetic book titled 'Jews: The Whole Truth\u2019 (more details here). While Pantelis Kapsis, a former government spokesman under the technocratic government of Lucas Papademos, will run a new ministry for the state broadcaster. He'll be tasked with creating a successor to ERT (whose closure sparked the latest political crisis in Greece). I'd be very interested to know what Greek readers think of the new cabinet. Meaanwhile, the financial markets in Europe remain gripped by the danger of a credit crunch in China, and the Federal Reserve's plans to withdraw its stimulus package. Asian markets have seen a volatile day's trading, with the Chinese Shanghai Composite falling more than 5% at one stage before rallying strongly. European stocks are expected to rise after yesterday's selloff, but bonds will be closely watched for signs that borrowing costs are inching up. And in London, Sir Mervyn King and senior colleagues from the Bank of England will be appearing at the Treasury Select Committee at Parliament to discuss the Bank's May 2013 Inflation Report. It's King's final public outing before he leaves Threadneedle Street at the end of the week.... I'll be tracking events in Greece, London and across the financial markets through the day....",

For many, the government is still doomed to fail precisely because the problems the country now faces \u2013 economically, politically and socially \u2013 are too big to tackle.&#xa0;</p> <p>With the departure of the small Democratic Left (Dimar) from the alliance, the government has lost the pretext it once had not to press ahead with pressing reforms, starting with lay-offs in the public sector. Similarly, there will be little excuse not to pull off a slew of privatisations in the months ahead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-63fe391b-760d-477f-b737-e573b31fe737\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/25/1372173451414/0fbb074d-e455-4f54-8deb-2e434eb4d763-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras arrives for a cabinet meeting at the Greek Parliament in Athens, Greece, 25 June 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antonis Samaras arrives for today's cabinet meeting, with his new team in tow.

      "body": "<p>The Irish prime minister has pledged to open an investigation into the \u20ac30bn (\u00a325.5bn) bailout of Anglo Irish Bank as it emerged that an executive sang \"<em>Deutschland, Deutschland, \u00fcber alles</em>\" as colleagues joked about German money flowing into the country after a state guarantee of the institution's deposits.</p> <p>A banker is heard on tape joking and singing the former first lines of the Deutschlandlied \u2013 not used since the Nazis made the first stanza their anthem \u2013 as the bank's then chief executive, David Drumm, urges his executives to \"get the fucking money in\". The recording was made in September 2008, when the Irish state stepped in to rescue a bank brought low by a property lending spree.</p> <p>Enda Kenny, the taoiseach, paved the way for a parliamentary inquiry into an \"axis of collusion\", although he stopped short of a full, Leveson-style inquiry. Referring to the former taoiseach Brian Cowen, who ran the country during the Anglo Irish bailout, he said: \"I assume that our predecessors here, people who served \u2026 in high office and in those governments, would have the opportunity and would have the willingness, I assume, to come to a parliamentary inquiry.\"</p> <p>The latest recordings to be leaked from inside the bank will compound national outrage in Ireland over the behaviour of Anglo Irish bankers.</p> <p>Dublin intervened in September 2008 with a guarantee of the bank's deposits to keep it afloat \u2013 a move that angered London and Berlin because it enticed money from British and German savers.</p> <p>Cowen's blanket bank guarantee, much criticised as foolish by other European Union governments, was designed to prevent Anglo's immediate collapse but instead put Ireland on a slippery slope to bailing out all six Irish-owned retail banks. In one conversation, two days after the fateful bank guarantee, Drumm giggles while his colleague John Bowe, then director of capital markets, recites lines from the Deutschlandlied.</p> <p>Drumm, who has since fled to the US, and Bowe are heard laughing about fears that the guarantee would drive a wedge between Ireland and its EU partners.</p> <p>The former said he would give \"two fingers\" to UK concerns.</p> <p>Bowe was recorded boasting that he had picked as the cost of the state rescuing them a random figure, of \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn), \"out of my arse\".</p> <p>Ireland's deputy prime minister, Eamon Gilmore, admitted on Tuesday ministers had been unaware the recorded conversations existed, even though the state has owned the bank since it was nationalised in 2009.</p> <p>He said the degree of arrogance and hubris of the bankers highlighted in the tapes was shocking, and made clear the need for a full parliamentary inquiry into the Irish banking collapse.</p> <p>\"That's why we have brought forward legislation to establish such an inquiry, and I hope that the legislation will be enacted before the summer and we can get on with it,\" Gilmore told RT\u00c9 radio. Gilmore added that the revelations couldcompromise Irish attempts to win further debt relief from the European Union. \"It makes it more difficult, of course it does, but we're going to continue to work to get the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer,\" he said.</p> <p>Kenny later confirmedthat the country's that police had had the Anglo Irish Bank tapes for four years.

      "bodyText": "The Irish prime minister has pledged to open an investigation into the \u20ac30bn (\u00a325.5bn) bailout of Anglo Irish Bank as it emerged that an executive sang \"Deutschland, Deutschland, \u00fcber alles\" as colleagues joked about German money flowing into the country after a state guarantee of the institution's deposits. A banker is heard on tape joking and singing the former first lines of the Deutschlandlied \u2013 not used since the Nazis made the first stanza their anthem \u2013 as the bank's then chief executive, David Drumm, urges his executives to \"get the fucking money in\". The recording was made in September 2008, when the Irish state stepped in to rescue a bank brought low by a property lending spree. Enda Kenny, the taoiseach, paved the way for a parliamentary inquiry into an \"axis of collusion\", although he stopped short of a full, Leveson-style inquiry. Referring to the former taoiseach Brian Cowen, who ran the country during the Anglo Irish bailout, he said: \"I assume that our predecessors here, people who served \u2026 in high office and in those governments, would have the opportunity and would have the willingness, I assume, to come to a parliamentary inquiry.\" The latest recordings to be leaked from inside the bank will compound national outrage in Ireland over the behaviour of Anglo Irish bankers. Dublin intervened in September 2008 with a guarantee of the bank's deposits to keep it afloat \u2013 a move that angered London and Berlin because it enticed money from British and German savers. Cowen's blanket bank guarantee, much criticised as foolish by other European Union governments, was designed to prevent Anglo's immediate collapse but instead put Ireland on a slippery slope to bailing out all six Irish-owned retail banks. In one conversation, two days after the fateful bank guarantee, Drumm giggles while his colleague John Bowe, then director of capital markets, recites lines from the Deutschlandlied. Drumm, who has since fled to the US, and Bowe are heard laughing about fears that the guarantee would drive a wedge between Ireland and its EU partners. The former said he would give \"two fingers\" to UK concerns. Bowe was recorded boasting that he had picked as the cost of the state rescuing them a random figure, of \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.9bn), \"out of my arse\". Ireland's deputy prime minister, Eamon Gilmore, admitted on Tuesday ministers had been unaware the recorded conversations existed, even though the state has owned the bank since it was nationalised in 2009. He said the degree of arrogance and hubris of the bankers highlighted in the tapes was shocking, and made clear the need for a full parliamentary inquiry into the Irish banking collapse. \"That's why we have brought forward legislation to establish such an inquiry, and I hope that the legislation will be enacted before the summer and we can get on with it,\" Gilmore told RT\u00c9 radio. Gilmore added that the revelations couldcompromise Irish attempts to win further debt relief from the European Union. \"It makes it more difficult, of course it does, but we're going to continue to work to get the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer,\" he said. Kenny later confirmedthat the country's that police had had the Anglo Irish Bank tapes for four years. He told the D\u00e1il they had been originally handed over to the Gardai when they began their when criminal investigations into the bank. His cabinet colleague, the finance minister, Michael Noonan, confirmed that he, too, was unaware of the tapes, even though it was standard procedure to record calls between senior banking personnel. Recordings obtained by the Irish Independent of Drumm joking about the rescue plan on the tapes will intensify anger in Ireland towards the top bankers, given that he remains in exile in Boston, allegedly owing the state \u20ac8m. Bowe has denied trying to mislead the state, adding that the reported remarks were \"off-the-cuff comments\".\". The secret tapes have compounded suspicions that Anglo Irish Bank's senior executives had lured the then Fianna F\u00e1il-led il-led government into a costly financial trap in the autumn of 2008. The figure of \u20ac7bn cited by Bowe more than quadrupled, to \u20ac30bn. During the Irish boom, Anglo Irish Bank became the preferred lender to property speculators and builders.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Jane Austen could be the face of the new \u00a310 note, according to the retiring governor of the Bank of England. The author is \"quietly waiting in the wings\", Sir Mervyn King told the Treasury select committee, although a final decision will be taken by his successor, Mark Carney, who takes up the post on 1 July. King provoked a storm of protest when he announced that the only woman to appear on an English banknote other than the Queen \u2013 the prison reformer Elizabeth Fry \u2013 would be replaced by Winston Churchill in 2015. Campaigners have threatened to take the Bank to court for discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act. Historical figures were first introduced on British banknotes in 1970, since when there have been only two women: Fry and Florence Nightingale. The others have all been men, from William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens to composer Sir Edward Elgar and scientist Michael Faraday. Caroline Criado-Perez, who is organising the legal action against the Bank, said she would not be \"placated\" by King's remarks. \"He is still talking in conditionals and I am afraid that is just not good enough. It is not good enough in terms of the demands of the campaign and it is also not good enough according to the Equality Act \u2026 which, as we have been saying all along, is about needing to know that the decision-making process is fair and equitable.\" Last week a group of 46 Labour MPs and peers, including former ministers Harriet Harman, Yvette Cooper and Labour leader of the Lords Baroness Royall, called on the Bank to review its decision to drop Fry. \"The fact that Florence Nightingale is the only other woman who has ever been represented alongside Elizabeth Fry also suggests there is a need for the Bank to show stronger leadership in honouring the role of women in our nation's history,\" they wrote in a letter to the Bank's board of directors, which was copied to Prime Minister David Cameron. More than 29,000 people, have signed a petition to keep women on English banknotes, damning Fry's relegation as \"yet another example of how the establishment undervalues the contributions of women to history\". Churchill, who King has described as \"a truly great British leader, orator and writer\", will make his debut on the \u00a35 note as planned from 2015. King added that once the Churchill notes are in circulation, Fry will continue to appear on the old \u00a35 notes until they are phased out. \"Let me assure that there is no imminent demise of Elizabeth Fry on our banknotes and I think it is extremely unlikely that we will ever find ourselves with no women on our banknotes,\" King said. Members of the public put forward suggestions on who should appear on banknotes, although the Bank only considers figures who have made an \"indisputable contribution to their particular field of work\". It takes into account the list of public suggestions when choosing a new picture but the governor of the Bank has the final decision. But King's surprise announcement that the author of Pride and Prejudice is a candidate for the \u00a310 note will put pressure on Carney to agree. The Bank has no deadline to introduce the next \u00a310 note, but Jane Austen would be a timely choice as the 200-year anniversary of her death falls in 2017. John Mullan, professor of English at University College London, said the author must be a shoo-in for the new note. \"It is not the question of whether she is a woman or not, but she seems to me the greatest English writer apart from Shakespeare.\" The theme of money runs through Austen's novels, from Mr Darcy's fabulous wealth in Pride and Prejudice, to the crimped lifestyle of the Dashwood sisters in Sense and Sensibility. \"Nobody has put money to better uses in their novels than her,\" Mullan said. \"There are plenty of novelists who think that money is important and make you aware of that when you are reading, but she makes her characters aware of it, which is a rather more brilliant thing. \"The animating thing in her novels is that everybody knows how much everyone is worth. \"As soon as [Mr Darcy] appears it is whispered around that he is worth \u00a310,000 a year. Mr Collins, when he proposes to Elizabeth, tells her how much her mother and father have. He knows what her parents income is exactly down to the last percent. That is what makes money pulse through all her novels, the fact that all the characters know about each other's money.\" Although Criado-Perez's top choice for the banknote was scientist Rosalind Franklin, the biophysicist who played a pioneering role in the discovery of the structure of DNA, she said Jane Austen would be a \"fantastic\" choice. \"One of the things I really love about her is that she seems very conservative, but she is actually incredibly subversive if you read her books carefully,\" she said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Global markets have \"jumped the gun\" in betting that interest rates will go back to normal levels anytime soon, the outgoing Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, has said in reaction to the widespread sell-off following Federal Reserve comments last week. Speaking at his last hearing with the all-party Treasury committee, King raised concerns over bank lobbying and bemoaned the \"disaster\" of austerity in some parts of the eurozone. He advised his successor, the Canadian Mark Carney, to be true to himself. Asked about the global shares rout, King said the Fed's chairman, Ben Bernanke, had been very clear when he talked about tapering the stimulus to the US economy. Bernanke \"certainly wasn't announcing the end of QE\", King said, in reference to the bond buying programme known as quantitative easing. He said: \"Certainly I think that the view that we are definitely at the beginning of the end, that we are definitely at the point where we need to raise interest rates, I think is a premature judgement about where we are and no central bank has moved rapidly down that course. The Federal Reserve has merely said that the easing in which it is still engaging may taper at some point depending on economic conditions.\" He stressed that his US counterpart did not set out a clear path for rates. \"Ben Bernanke made it 100% obvious it will depend on the incoming data \u2026 No one would sit down today and say this is the path of interest rates we intend to follow. That would be crazy.\" In terms of the market reaction which, combined with growing concerns about China's economy, also saw losses for bonds and commodities, King suggested it was overdone. \"I think people have rather jumped the gun thinking this means an imminent return to normal levels of interest rates. It doesn't,\" he said. \"Until markets see in place policies to bring about that return to normal economic conditions, there is no prospect for sustainable recovery and without that prospect for sustainable recovery, markets understand that it will not be sensible to return interest rates to normal levels.\" Alongside the hearing, the Treasury committee also published a BoE note that confirmed policymakers would not rule out cutting interest rates below zero \u2013 which would mean commercial banks paying the Bank to hold reserves. The paper from Charlie Bean, the Bank's deputy governor responsible for monetary policy, was in response to a committee request for more information after the topic of such an unusual move was raised at a hearing earlier this year. Bean did not rule out such a cut to rates but said other actions were more likely. \"At the present juncture, the committee believes that further asset purchases and targeted policies to restore the functioning of the monetary transmission mechanism, such as the Funding for Lending Scheme, represent more reliable tools for stimulating aggregate demand than does a further reduction in bank rate. But a reduction in bank rate, including below zero, remains an option which the monetary policy committee will keep under review lest circumstance change in the future,\" he said. At his final hearing before handing over to Carney in July, King also answered questions on bank lobbying, banker pay and the eurozone, where he thought austerity had been a \"disaster\" in some parts. On banks, he said politicians and officials had \"clearly come under tremendous pressure themselves from banks\". \"They've been lobbied,\" he said. \"They have passed on concerns \u2026 various conversations have taken place with others and I think it is very important that people simply should say if they are lobbied. \"There were certainly calls made to number 11 and even in some cases to number 10 to try put pressure on supervisors to modify, be more reasonable in their judgement.\" On bankers' pay, King said one factor pushing up remuneration was the help banks were given by authorities fearing that the institutions were too big to fail. \"I don't think you can blame banks if you give them a big subsidy and they look around for interesting ways to spend it,\" he said. King also gave some insight into how his successor compares with his own style, describing Carney as \"more persuasive\" but stressed that he still had only one vote out of nine on the monetary policy committee. He said he had no intention of giving public advice to Carney, but: \"He should be himself. Governors change. It is very important each governor should be himself \u2026 He must and I am sure he will be himself\" King also revealed that Jane Austen may appear on bank notes, which may go some way to calming the controversy that erupted when the Bank announced that Winston Churchill planned to replace Elizabeth Fry on \u00a35 notes, meaning that British bank notes would no longer portray any female historical figures. King said that by the time Churchill took Fry's place there would have been another announcement. \"Jane Austen is quietly waiting in the wings,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>Global markets have \"jumped the gun\" in betting that interest rates will go back to normal levels anytime soon, the outgoing Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, has said in reaction to the widespread sell-off following Federal Reserve comments last week.</p> <p>Speaking at his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/jun/25/mervyn-king-treasury-committee-live-blog\" title=\"\">last hearing with the all-party Treasury committee</a>, King raised concerns over bank lobbying and bemoaned the \"disaster\" of austerity in some parts of the eurozone. He advised his successor, the Canadian Mark Carney, to be true to himself.</p> <p>Asked about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/20/world-stock-markets-fall-bernanke-ftse\" title=\"\">global shares rout</a>, King said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/19/federal-reserve-interest-rates-stimulus\" title=\"\">the Fed's chairman, Ben Bernanke, had been very clear</a> when he talked about tapering the stimulus to the US economy. Bernanke \"certainly wasn't announcing the end of QE\", King said, in reference to the bond buying programme known as quantitative easing.</p> <p>He said: \"Certainly I think that the view that we are definitely at the beginning of the end, that we are definitely at the point where we need to raise interest rates, I think is a premature judgement about where we are and no central bank has moved rapidly down that course. The Federal Reserve has merely said that the easing in which it is still engaging may taper at some point depending on economic conditions.\"</p> <p>He stressed that his US counterpart did not set out a clear path for rates. \"Ben Bernanke made it 100% obvious it will depend on the incoming data \u2026 No one would sit down today and say this is the path of interest rates we intend to follow. That would be crazy.\"</p> <p>In terms of the market reaction which, combined with growing concerns about China's economy, also saw losses for bonds and commodities, King suggested it was overdone.</p> <p>\"I think people have rather jumped the gun thinking this means an imminent return to normal levels of interest rates. It doesn't,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Until markets see in place policies to bring about that return to normal economic conditions, there is no prospect for sustainable recovery and without that prospect for sustainable recovery, markets understand that it will not be sensible to return interest rates to normal levels.\"</p> <p>Alongside the hearing, the Treasury committee also published a BoE note that confirmed policymakers would not rule out cutting interest rates below zero \u2013 which would mean commercial banks paying the Bank to hold reserves. The paper from Charlie Bean, the Bank's deputy governor responsible for monetary policy, was in response to a committee request for more information after the topic of such an unusual move was raised at a hearing earlier this year.</p> <p>Bean did not rule out such a cut to rates but said other actions were more likely.</p> <p>\"At the present juncture, the committee believes that further asset purchases and targeted policies to restore the functioning of the monetary transmission mechanism, such as the Funding for Lending Scheme, represent more reliable tools for stimulating aggregate demand than does a further reduction in bank rate. But a reduction in bank rate, including below zero, remains an option which the monetary policy committee will keep under review lest circumstance change in the future,\" he said.</p> <p>At his final hearing before handing over to Carney in July, King also answered questions on bank lobbying, banker pay and the eurozone, where he thought austerity had been a \"disaster\" in some parts.</p> <p>On banks, he said politicians and officials had \"clearly come under tremendous pressure themselves from banks\". \"They've been lobbied,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They have passed on concerns \u2026 various conversations have taken place with others and I think it is very important that people simply should say if they are lobbied.</p> <p>\"There were certainly calls made to number 11 and even in some cases to number 10 to try put pressure on supervisors to modify, be more reasonable in their judgement.\"</p> <p>On bankers' pay, King said one factor pushing up remuneration was the help banks were given by authorities fearing that the institutions were too big to fail.</p> <p>\"I don't think you can blame banks if you give them a big subsidy and they look around for interesting ways to spend it,\" he said.</p> <p>King also gave some insight into how his successor compares with his own style, describing Carney as \"more persuasive\" but stressed that he still had only one vote out of nine on the monetary policy committee. He said he had no intention of giving public advice to Carney, but: \"He should be himself. Governors change. It is very important each governor should be himself \u2026 He must and I am sure he will be himself\"</p> <p>King also revealed that Jane Austen may appear on bank notes, which may go some way to calming the controversy that erupted when the Bank announced that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/26/winston-churchill-new-five-pound-note\" title=\"\">Winston Churchill planned to replace Elizabeth Fry on \u00a35 notes</a>, meaning that British bank notes would no longer portray any female historical figures. King said that by the time Churchill took Fry's place there would have been another announcement.</p> <p>\"Jane Austen is quietly waiting in the wings,\" he said.</p>",

It has come under pressure on concerns about growing competition, not least from Intel in the smartphone and tablet market. But it has added 33.5p to 792p after Investec moved from hold to buy:</p> <blockquote> Sentiment has turned from a one way bull run in Arm's stock during the second half of 2012 to a steady sell off, with the shares now down around 32% since the May analyst day. We see Arm as the most attractive long term investment in the sector with underpinned earnings growth. Negative sentiment, but strong fundamentals creates an attractive entry point in our view. The current price implies material near term market share losses which we see as unlikely. Trading around 20% below its historic average PE, 2014 estimated cash around 9% of the market cap and with a strong outlook, we move back to buy with a 1000p target price. <br> </blockquote> <p>Not everyone agreed. Liberum Capital repeated its sell rating with analyst Janardan Menon saying:</p> <blockquote> Arm's share price is down 30% in the past month on concerns of Intel taking share in the Arm dominated smartphone and tablet markets. While much of our argument that Intel will take at least 15%-20% share from Arm in these markets is based on an analysis of the technology and Intel's comparable or lower levels of power consumption, Forbes in an article today states that Intel is also embarking on a subtle marketing campaign to gain share here. <br> It has got a program called the Creators Project which is a global arts and technology initiative. It has brought 100s of artists together to create original art while bringing together music, film, arts and technology on its websites. It has also staged live events in 6 countries. While at the end of the day the choice of processor for a smartphone or tablet vendor like Samsung, Apple, Nokia or HTC will depend primarily on the technological capabilities of the processor and its cost, any help with the branding and the coolness of the device would definitely be welcomed by them. We continue to believe that the market has not yet priced in the potential share loss for Arm to Intel. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps <strong>Domino Printing</strong> has dropped 20p to 578p after it unveiled a 3% fall in first half profits to \u00a325m, and warned of continued uncertainty in Europe.</p>",

Investors were also spooked on Monday by a possible credit crunch in China. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: The bounce off 6,000 will have generated much excitement about this being the bottom. I'm not dismissing the value of round numbers (they are often conveniently helpful), and I like that fact that we have found support around the 6,040 level I suggested, but we cannot ignore or deny the fact that the index remains in a clear downtrend with myriad hurdles which could scupper the first hints of a recovery. One stock which is showing signs of recovery after a recent torrid time is chipmaker Arm. It has come under pressure on concerns about growing competition, not least from Intel in the smartphone and tablet market. But it has added 33.5p to 792p after Investec moved from hold to buy: Sentiment has turned from a one way bull run in Arm's stock during the second half of 2012 to a steady sell off, with the shares now down around 32% since the May analyst day. We see Arm as the most attractive long term investment in the sector with underpinned earnings growth. Negative sentiment, but strong fundamentals creates an attractive entry point in our view. The current price implies material near term market share losses which we see as unlikely. Trading around 20% below its historic average PE, 2014 estimated cash around 9% of the market cap and with a strong outlook, we move back to buy with a 1000p target price. Not everyone agreed. Liberum Capital repeated its sell rating with analyst Janardan Menon saying: Arm's share price is down 30% in the past month on concerns of Intel taking share in the Arm dominated smartphone and tablet markets. While much of our argument that Intel will take at least 15%-20% share from Arm in these markets is based on an analysis of the technology and Intel's comparable or lower levels of power consumption, Forbes in an article today states that Intel is also embarking on a subtle marketing campaign to gain share here. It has got a program called the Creators Project which is a global arts and technology initiative. It has brought 100s of artists together to create original art while bringing together music, film, arts and technology on its websites. It has also staged live events in 6 countries. While at the end of the day the choice of processor for a smartphone or tablet vendor like Samsung, Apple, Nokia or HTC will depend primarily on the technological capabilities of the processor and its cost, any help with the branding and the coolness of the device would definitely be welcomed by them. We continue to believe that the market has not yet priced in the potential share loss for Arm to Intel. Among the mid-caps Domino Printing has dropped 20p to 578p after it unveiled a 3% fall in first half profits to \u00a325m, and warned of continued uncertainty in Europe.",
