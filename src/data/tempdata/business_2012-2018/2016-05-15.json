      "bodyText": "The average asking price of a typical first-time buyer home leapt by 6.2% in a month after buy-to-let investors rushed to buy properties before last month\u2019s stamp duty increase, according to figures on Monday. The average for properties coming on to the market in England and Wales with two bedrooms or fewer was \u00a311,298 higher in May than in April, at \u00a3194,224, according to data from the property website Rightmove. The figures, based on properties listed during the month, showed that across the UK the average price of a first-time buyer property had risen by 11.4% since May 2015. In hotspots such as Croydon, Dartford and Luton \u2013 all towns within easy commuting distance of central London \u2013 asking prices were up by more than 18% over the year. The figures do not include inner-London homes. The website said strong demand from investors keen to buy before the introduction of the surcharge on second homes had caused a \u201cproperty drought\u201d at the lower end of the market, putting upwards pressure on prices for those homes that were being made available. However, Rightmove\u2019s director, Miles Shipside, said: \u201cIt remains to be seen if these prices can be achieved and there may be some over pricing in the market. It is also a reflection of better quality property coming to market in this sector which is now targeting owner-occupiers rather than landlords.\u201d In Llandudno, north Wales, prices were down by 7.5% year-on-year and in Darlington, north-east England, they dropped by 3%. Across all property types, Rightmove said average asking prices had increased by 0.4% over the month to an average of \u00a3308,151. Prices were down on the previous month in London, the north-west and the north-east, but in all other regions sellers appeared more confident than in April. The stamp duty increase came into effect on 1 April after being unveiled in November\u2019s autumn statement. Second homes now attract a three percentage point surcharge, adding \u00a36,000 to the upfront cost of a \u00a3200,000 property. Figures from HM Revenue and Customs showed a spike in purchases before the change, with 161,990 sales of \u00a340,000 or more registered during March. There are signs that landlords are still willing to buy, but are focusing their attention on the cheaper end of the market. Paul Milson at estate agents Leaders in Epsom, Surrey, said: \u201cDespite the increase in stamp duty, investors are still keen to purchase one-bedroom flats because they make good long-term investments due to their higher yields, potential for capital gains and consistently high demand from tenants. \u201cHowever, supply of two-bedroom flats is currently good across the board and prices for these appear to have peaked.\u201d Research by estate agents Countrywide showed the average price paid by investors fell by 8.3% in April, from \u00a3194,000 to \u00a3178,000. Stamp duty on the cheaper property would now be \u00a36,400 - \u00a3800 lower than on March\u2019s average price. Countrywide said investors in London paid an average of \u00a3365,000 in April v \u00a3436,000 in March, attracting a stamp duty bill of \u00a319,200 rather than \u00a324,880. Johnny Morris, its research director, said: \u201cRather than being dissuaded by the new 3% charge it seems that landlords are already adjusting their behaviour. In response to the extra purchasing costs many are choosing to buy cheaper homes that offer a higher yield and of course a lower stamp duty bill.\u201d He said there were early signs that first-time buyer numbers were increasing, but added: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell whether this is simply the after effects of the stamp duty rush or the start of a longer term trend.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Heathrow bosses will stand to gain from bonus payouts if the airport gets permission to build a \u00a317.6bn third runway, it has emerged. Although the west London airport has previously denied the existence of any such financial incentives \u2013 not least when senior executives at rival Gatwick were found to have incentives to win a second runway \u2013 the annual report of Heathrow Airport Holdings states that during 2015 \u201ca new bonus scheme was launched based on EBITDA, passenger service and airport expansion over the Q6 period\u201d (pdf), which runs from 2014 to 2020. A Heathrow spokesman said the runway bonus would only be a small part of a payout for meeting the strategic requirements of the business, and rests on first hitting the profit targets and independently monitored customer satisfaction scores. Chief executive John Holland-Kaye earned \u00a32.06m last year, more than doubling his basic salary of \u00a3885,000. However, he could add even more to that should a third runway be approved. The annual report states that while a bonus scheme linked to expansion was launched in 2015, \u201cas the performance in respect of this scheme is so uncertain at this stage, no value in relation to these awards is included\u201d in his 2015 earnings package. Holland-Kaye, who refused to confirm any such bonus existed in a Guardian interview earlier this year, is believed to be the architect of the new scheme. The airport cut its wider wage bill by cutting 300 jobs last year. Owned by a consortium of foreign interests, including Qatar and China\u2019s sovereign wealth funds, Heathrow would hope to become Europe\u2019s predominant hub with an extra runway, raising landing charges significantly to fund its expansion. Heathrow last week abandoned its opposition to conditions laid down by the Airports Commission when it recommended a third runway. The airport agreed to a ban on night flights for a six-and-a-half-hour period and said it would abide by any government decision to rule out a fourth runway. A decision on whether to grant permission for the airport\u2019s expansion plan is expected from the government in the summer, although Holland-Kaye last week conceded that the definition of summer was likely to be stretched. Further work into air quality problems in west London, one ostensible reason given for the delay, is expected to be concluded in the coming months by the Department for Transport. Sixty-five MPs have signed an early-day motion urging the government to make a decision before the recess, while the transport select committee recently demanded a clear timetable be set out by transport secretary.",

      "bodyText": "The Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico is set in postwar London with austerity at its height. Inhabitants find that they can escape rationing because the district was once part of Burgundy during a conflict that has never formally ended. They set up their own kingdom within a kingdom, defiantly resisting attempts by Westminster to bludgeon them back into line. The mood of stubborn resistance is summed up by one of the characters whose Englishness is called into question. \u201cWe always were English and we always will be English and it\u2019s because we are English that we are sticking up for our right to be Burgundian.\u201d Something of this mood has pervaded the EU referendum debate, so far at least. Warnings about the dire consequences of a vote to leave have come in thick and fast. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said Brexit would be the equivalent of a tax increase, the Bank of England said it might tip the economy into a technical recession and the International Monetary Fund said Britons should brace themselves for a stock market crash and plunging house prices. Appearing on The Andrew Marr Show, the pro-Brexit energy minister Andrea Leadsom described it as \u201cinstitutional ganging up on the poor British voter\u201d. One of the leaders of the gang, Mark Carney, was also interviewed on the BBC programme. The Bank of England governor was unrepentant about his public warning last week that the higher inflation and slower growth Threadneedle Street thinks would result from a Brexit vote might be enough to tip the economy into recession. What\u2019s interesting about the campaign so far is that the bloodcurdling warnings about the horrors that will be visited on the economy in the event of Brexit seem to have had such little effect. The remain camp think the intervention of Carney will prove decisive in swaying undecided voters, and some on the leave side privately agree. It is possible that the polls are understating support for the status quo, which will only become apparent in the last few weeks before the 23 June vote, when people really start to concentrate on how they will vote. But so far, the Brexit camp must be pretty pleased with how things are going. The bloody-minded spirit of Passport to Pimlico lives on. There are umpteen possible explanations for that. It could be the heavy-handed way the government has gone about things, which has allowed the leavers to portray themselves \u2013 in true Ealing comedy fashion \u2013 as underdogs. As one small example, the IMF\u2019s annual health check on the UK economy was delayed last year because it did not want to be dragged into politics at the time of the general election. Those niceties have been cast aside this year, with the fund\u2019s report used as a campaigning weapon by George Osborne. The initial findings of the IMF team sent to the UK were published last Friday: the full report will appear the week before the referendum. The remain camp also needs to be careful not to overstate its case. There would undoubtedly be a great deal of uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of a vote to leave. Sterling would take a hit and dearer exports would push up inflation. A slowdown in the economy has been under way for several quarters and was happening long before the prospect of Brexit surfaced. It is not outlandish of the Bank of England to float the idea that the economy could slide into technical recession given that growth was 0.4% in the first three months of 2016 and a further slowdown looks highly probable in the second quarter as investment is delayed in the run-up to the 23 June vote. There would then be a further hit to activity after a Brexit vote. Clearly, two quarters of negative growth \u2013 the definition of a recession \u2013 cannot be ruled out. But the sky would not fall in. Britain would remain a member of the EU for at least two years after a no vote and the full weight of the UK political establishment would instantly switch from warning about the dire perils of Brexit to ensuring that the costs of divorce would be minimised. There is no certainty that Christine Lagarde\u2019s prediction of a crash in house prices would come true and it would be a net benefit to the economy if it did. Likewise a fall in the value of the pound, which would do something to help rebalance the economy by making exports cheaper. Conversely, a remain vote is likely to lead to a stronger pound, making the imbalances worse. Both the Bank and the IMF assume that the economy is in pretty good shape and will bounce back quickly once the threat of Brexit is removed. But as the IMF noted in its Article IV report, the underlying problems of the economy \u2013 the low level of household savings, an abysmally poor productivity performance and a terrifyingly large current account deficit \u2013 have actually got worse in the past year. The Bank\u2019s growth forecasts, which assume that the UK will stay in the EU, have been cut since February as a result of the continuing weakness of productivity. The underlying problems of the economy are the result of decades of under-investment in the economy\u2019s productive base, not the Brexit threat. It is therefore open to the remain side to make the case that leaving the EU is a shock the UK could do without at a time when the economy is not in the greatest shape. This has the virtue of being true and might impress voters put off by hyperbolic claims that Britain risks becoming an economic wasteland within weeks of 23 June. Yet, it doesn\u2019t suit Osborne\u2019s narrative, which is that the economy has flourished under his stewardship these past six years and that Britain will be a land overflowing with milk and honey once the threat of Brexit has been banished. Instead, he will crank up the volume still higher over the next few weeks, confident that the tactic that has been so successful in swaying floating voters in general elections \u2013 Labour is bad for your wealth \u2013 will work just as well in the referendum. But maybe it won\u2019t. Veteran economics commentator Brian Reading made the point last week that the 13 American colonies were fully aware of the consequences for trade and capital flows from Britain if they chose independence. Noting that George Washington et al preferred making their own laws rather than having them made in London, Reading said: \u201cNo one today would argue that the American states would have been better off remaining UK colonies.\u201d Is Britain gearing up for a 1776 moment? It seems improbable. In Passport to Pimlico, remember, the film ends with the status quo restored. But polls suggest many voters are looking beyond Carney\u2019s \u201ctechnical recession\u201d. And that\u2019s making the remain camp very nervous.",

    "webTitle": "Shell creates green energy division to invest in wind power", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shell, Europe\u2019s largest oil company, has established a separate division, New Energies, to invest in renewable and low-carbon power. The move emerged days after experts at Chatham House warned international oil companies they must transform their business or face a \u201cshort, brutal\u201d end within 10 years. Shell\u2019s new division brings together its existing hydrogen, biofuels and electrical activities but will also be used as a base for a new drive into wind power, according to an internal announcement to company staff. With $1.7bn of capital investment currently attached to it and annual capital expenditure of $200m, New Energies will be run alongside the Integrated Gas division under executive board member Maarten Wetselaar. Insiders said the group chief executive, Ben van Beurden, wants to ensure Shell is at the forefront of oil company innovation. \u201cHe does not want to get out so far in front where he dilutes investor returns but he does want to make sure Shell is at the leading edge of transition [to lower-carbon economies].\u201d The Anglo-Dutch group may already be trailing Total of France, which already has its own New Energies division and boasts of being the world\u2019s second-ranked solar energy operator through its affiliate SunPower, bought for \u00a3800m in 2011. Shell has made no formal announcement so far about New Energies but the new business is expected to be revealed at a public strategy briefing in London on 7 June. Company insiders claimed Shell wants to play down the importance of New Energies for fear it will be written off as a \u201cgreenwash\u201d exercise by environmentalists, but said the company believes the new business could become very big \u2013 although not for a decade or more. It is unlikely Greenpeace and others will be impressed by New Energies, given that the division\u2019s annual spending level is less than 1% of the total $30bn Shell pumps into oil and gas. Van Beurden has not yet signalled a slowdown in the high-cost oil and gas investment that has made Shell a target of anti-fossil fuel campaigners, who believe such investments will only result in so-called stranded assets \u2013 carbon made unburnable by international commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Shell has pulled back from high-risk Arctic drilling but is still engaged in deepwater projects and in the high-CO2 Canadian tar sands \u2013 although it is trying to cut emissions by developing a carbon, capture and storage facility. The Shell boss told investors at a company meeting in London last week he did expect oil and gas demand to continue strongly but the company also took its responsibilities to tackle global warming seriously. \u201cThe big challenge, both for society and for a company like Shell is how to provide much more energy, while at the same time significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions,\u201d he said. The following day Shell announced it was bidding in a partnership to build two windfarms off the Dutch coast that will be big enough to power 825,000 households. Shell already holds interests in nine other wind projects in North America and Europe, although spending on wind, solar and hydrogen projects was suspended by former chief executive Jeroen van der Veer in 2009. A substantial solar operation had been largely sold off three years before that. Rival BP also promised to go \u201cbeyond petroleum\u201d and established an Alternative Energy business with its own London headquarters and chief executive, only to gradually wind it down. Paul Stevens, a fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said in a research paper that the oil majors were no longer fit for purpose \u2013 hit by low crude prices, tightening climate change regulations and wrongheaded strategies. In the report, Stevens argued the only way forward for the companies lay in diversifying into green energy, drastically reducing their operations or consolidating through mega-mergers. \u201cThe prognosis for the IOCs [international oil companies] was already grim before governments became serious about climate change and the oil price collapsed \u2026 their old business model is dying,\u201d said Stevens, a visiting professor at University College London.",

      "bodyText": "Thomas Cook has recruited Belinda Phipps, a strategist from the charity and public sectors, to establish the charity for safer tourism which it founded with Sharon Wood, whose children died on a Thomas Cook holiday in Corfu. The tour operator said in November it would provide \u00a31m of initial funding for the Safer Tourism Foundation to make travel safer for holidaymakers. It did so as part of efforts to build bridges with Wood, who had campaigned for nine years for the company to take responsibility for the deaths of her children. Christi and Bobby Shepherd, aged seven and six, died in 2006 from carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty boiler at a bungalow attached to Louis Corcyra Beach hotel in Corfu. Wood accused Thomas Cook of ignorance about the hotel\u2019s safety measures but the company largely ignored her until Peter Fankhauser, chief executive since November 2014, met her to apologise after an inquest last year found Thomas Cook responsible. Phipps chairs the Fawcett Society and is chief executive of the Science Council. She ran the National Childbirth Trust for 15 years and was chief executive of East Berkshire NHS trust. She will work about two days a week as a consultant on the new charity\u2019s strategy, constitution and branding as it seeks authorisation from the Charity Commission. She will also liaise between Thomas Cook, the commission and the trustees, which include Wood. Linda McAvan, the MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber who has campaigned in the European parliament for carbon monoxide safety, has joined as a trustee. Phipps said: \u201cThomas Cook does not know anything about setting up charities. We have a draft strategy in place that has been discussed with the trustees and we\u2019re formalising that. We will probably commission some research to look at the size of the issue we are tackling.\u201d She said the foundation\u2019s work would go beyond the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning, though that would be a significant part of its activities. She said Wood, whom she has met a few times, agreed with the broader remit and that the charity would seek to educate the public and improve standards in the industry. \u201cWe want to see preventable, accidental deaths among travellers reduced to the same level as for non-travellers carrying out similar activities, but we want to have the most effect on the most things. We have to go out and see what the numbers look like.\u201d Thomas Cook, which announces financial results on Thursday, is paying for the charity\u2019s startup costs, including Phipps\u2019s pay and legal fees, so that its \u00a31m donation will be intact when the foundation is launched. \u201cThat means the charity will get off to a flying start and the new chief executive will be in a better position than they often are in a new charity,\u201d Phipps said.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne was just one of the latest people to warn about the growing threat of antibiotic resistant superbugs, telling the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington last month that without urgent action the bugs would soon kill more people every year than cancer. The chancellor\u2019s warning echoed the sentiments of many within the medical community. Infections such as MRSA which have developed resistance to drugs have become a notorious threat in hospitals, where the bacteria can survive on surfaces for up to seven months. But a new discovery by scientists in Ireland could soon be working to combat them. A research team led by Prof Suresh Pillai has developed a coating for everyday objects that prevents the spread of MRSA and E coli bacteria. The coating, which can be used on items such as smartphones, door handles and remote controls as well as surgical surfaces, has a 99.99% success rate in killing the bugs. John Browne, the chief executive of Dublin-based company Kastus, which is working to commercialise the solution, says: \u201cIt is very hard to get rid of these things once they are there. Some studies have shown that with a deep clean on an [intensive care unit] ward where there is a critical care bed in one room \u2026 the entire room is cleaned with bleach over a 24-hour period and the bacteria are back on the surface within 24 hours.\u201d In a 2014 study, the resistance of MRSA to meticillin, one of the first antibiotics used to treat the bacteria, was at almost 12% in UK hospitals. Another study showed that almost 93% of writing tools taken from a group of 42 doctors were contaminated. The Kastus anti-microbial solution is made up of titanium oxide, with fluoride and copper. The solution is first baked on to a surface such as glass. When light is shined on it, a series of reactions on the surface of the material make it resistant to MRSA and E coli as well as trichophyton rubrum, the main cause of athlete\u2019s foot. \u201cYou prepare the material in a water-based solution and spray it on the surface. It will form a thin coating on the surface and then you bake it in the oven or furnace and that will make a transparent thin film. You will not even see that there is a coating there,\u201d says Pillai, who is from the nanotechnology research group at the Institute of Technology, Sligo. Any MRSA or E coli landing on the surface of the tile will die over the subsequent 24 hours, so the solution stops it forming a colony and spreading \u2013 in effect creating a reliably sterile surface, he says. Even when doctors adhere to proper hygiene practices, everyday objects and areas such as door handles and other surfaces can foster the bacteria. \u201cIn the [US], if you go into a hospital with a broken leg and get a case of MRSA and don\u2019t survive it, your estate has to sue that hospital because the health insurance won\u2019t pay because the hospital is being treated as liable. I think a lot of us know people who have gone into hospital for minor surgeries as patients and have contracted bugs,\u201d says Browne. \u201cI think we have all been in hospitals and we have seen dirt in floors and corners that have just not been cleaned. They are ceramic tiles. If there is a dirty corner then it is likely that the entire surface has been affected and it is likely that you are walking it through the building.\u201d Browne aims to have the solution applied to smartphone and tablet screens, said to be fertile grounds for bacteria because they typically do not go through rigorous cleansing. In 2012, a man contracted Ebola after stealing a mobile phone from an isolation ward in Uganda. \u201cThe product is scaleable so the idea is that it gets out there and becomes a standard on smartphones and on ATMs. It is there and it is not adding any significant cost for the manufacturer of the end product,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are using an eco product, it is safe and it is helping to stop the spread of harmful bacteria.\u201d There is little hard data to show how wide a problem the spread of bacteria via mobile devices is, but they certainly harbour bacteria and some of the keenest interest in the new product has so far come from electronics companies. \u201cMobile phones contain 10 times more bacteria than the toilet seat because toilet seats are cleaned regularly and mobile phones are never cleaned,\u201d says Pillai. There are plans to develop towels which will stop the spread of superbugs by the solution adhering to the fabric. \u201cYou need special types of spray or cottons which will withstand several washes,\u201d he says. Pharmaceutical firms that use \u201cclean rooms\u201d for research will also be targeted, says Browne. \u201cIf a fungus enters a clean room, it could close a building down. A lot of these clean rooms are separated into different buildings to stop this happening. The cost to do that is enormous and if a fungus gets in, it is serious.\u201d The company also plans to investigate possible uses for the technology in food packaging, for instance as the coating on a glass bottle. \u201cThere has been a test on milk bottles showing that an anti-bacterial coating can extend the life of milk by 15 days,\u201d adds Browne.",

      "bodyText": "On Wall Street, you eat what you kill. And boy, can they eat. According to a just-published annual survey by Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine, the 25 best-paid hedge fund honchos pocketed $13bn in 2015, a sum that exceeds the gross domestic products of many nations. What\u2019s interesting is that the huge payout comes in a year that has been more notable for the flight of investors from hedge funds, and that this year\u2019s big winners are more reliant than ever on algorithms to make their money. \u201cThe hedge fund model is under challenge,\u201d billionaire investment guru Leon Cooperman said at the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference (aka Salt) earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s under assault.\u201d Cooperman, a famous workaholic, even openly questioned whether it made sense for him to keep his fund open after some of his investors asked for their money to be returned to them. But then, Cooperman didn\u2019t qualify for Alpha magazine\u2019s rich list. He may be a billionaire, and over the years has often topped the rankings (he took home $825m as recently as 2013), but he lost money for his investors in 2015, and that meant he didn\u2019t make the grade. The hedge fund universe is a ruthless one: if you don\u2019t deliver for your investors, you don\u2019t get to collect fees big enough to brag about. Increasingly, so-called active managers such as Cooperman, John Paulson (one of the coterie of hedge fund guys who bet that subprime mortgages would blow up the banking system in the years leading up to the financial crisis), and Bill Ackman, of Pershing Square Capital Management, are doing very badly when it comes to that apparently simple task: identifying a cluster of investments that will perform far, far better than the broad market, and deliver outsize returns to their investors. Although Ackman had a great year in 2014, his 2015 was utterly disastrous. His fund will stay alive: it\u2019s large and his investors pay a 1.5% management fee, regardless of performance. But in the wake of his big losses due to bad bets on pharmaceutical company Valeant (thanks to which countless other hedge funds found themselves swimming in a sea of red ink) and others, Pershing Square has plunged more than 40%. Before he can begin to pocket his incentive fee \u2013 the source of the lion\u2019s share of any hedge fund manager\u2019s earnings \u2013 he\u2019ll have to recover that lost ground. By some estimates, he\u2019ll need a 60%-plus rally. The guys who are still making money hand over fist are doing so using not their own brains, but computer models. To be specific, they are \u201cquants\u201d, or quantitative hedge fund managers: eight of the ten top earners on Alpha\u2019s list fall into that category, and half of the 25 richest of the year are quants. Either they rely exclusively on computer models to tell them when and what to buy and sell, as Jim Simons at Renaissance Technologies \u2013 who holds the distinction of being the only person to appear on the list 15 years running \u2013 does, or they use them extensively to guide their decision-making, as does Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates. What this data shows is the beginning of a schism in the hedge fund universe between the traditional active hedge fund managers \u2013 traders or investors who scour the markets in search of a clever idea and then bet on it, sometimes using derivatives or other kinds of leverage to magnify the impact of their position \u2013 and the quant world. The latter group is tied to computer models and their screens, and couldn\u2019t care less about a company\u2019s business model or \u201cstory\u201d, as long as all those numbers they are screening for show up clearly. Last year, David Siegel, cofounder of Two Sigma Investments, one of those quants, announced that one day \u201cno human investment manager will be able to beat the computer\u201d. Siegel, himself a computer scientist, now manages more than $35bn, and qualified for Alpha\u2019s \u201crich list\u201d for the first time this year. He debuted at No 7 with estimated 2015 earnings of $500m. Clearly, even if some pension funds, including the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPers), have decided that the hefty fees simply don\u2019t make sense for most hedge funds, they remain willing to pay big money to these \u201cquants\u201d. They don\u2019t mind making the managers rich if those managers deliver blockbuster returns to investors, as well. And while CalPers was earning only 7.1% from its portfolio of hedge fund investments in the year before it pulled the plug on them in 2014, the big quant funds have posted significantly better results. Two Sigma\u2019s two benchmark funds both returned 15% (after fees) last year, when many actively managed hedge funds posted losses or only meager returns. If the trend continues, brace yourself for a shakeup in the hedge fund universe. First of all, we can bid farewell to the adulatory treatment given to the masters of the universe who appear at conferences or on television to share their wisdom and stock picks with us (promoting their ideas in the process, of course, in hopes of making both short and long ideas become self-fulfilling prophecies). This would be an excellent development; very little of this \u201cadvice\u201d is useful to the general investor, and a lot of it risks becoming harmful. At one Ira Sohn conference, hedge fund investor David Einhorn recommended buying SunEdison; the company later filed for bankruptcy. Bill Ackman took to the podium to promote Valeant, and the less said about that, the better. It\u2019s likely that the number of hedge funds will continue to diminish, and even that investors will continue to pull assets out of the hands of hedge fund managers. That, too, is good news: with more hedge funds than Taco Bell outlets, it\u2019s simply impossible for each and every one to add the kind of value that they promise. It\u2019s an industry that can only deliver what it pledges if it remains small. But not everyone will do so: UBS already has said it plans to allocate more client assets to hedge funds. To the extent that more of those assets start flowing into the hands of the quants, it\u2019s to be hoped that investors strive to understand what lies behind some of these \u201cblack box\u201d models, not all of which are transparent or easily understood, even by veterans of the investment space. At least, in contrast to some egregious corporate CEO compensation packages, at hedge funds it\u2019s impossible to become extraordinarily wealthy if your investors don\u2019t become wealthy, too. But what kinds of investment strategies are making them wealthy? Now that this is changing, it\u2019s time to look closely at this question. It\u2019s also past time to address the longstanding question of just how these hedge fund billionaires are taxed on their riches. They earn the bulk of their income in the form of \u201ccarried interest\u201d \u2013 or profits on the sale of securities, which the taxman, in his wisdom, chooses to treat as if they were the same as the proceeds your local deli owner gets when selling his business. Both sources of income are taxed at a lower rate, instead of at the normal income tax rate (thus meaning that a hedge fund manager might pay as little as half the top income tax rate of 39%). This loophole could be addressed by the president quite easily, or formalized by Congress \u2013 and it would be a very popular move. Except, of course, with the 25 big earners on Alpha\u2019s \u201crich list\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "There is a quiet crisis in British business. The number of quoted British public companies has halved over the past 15 years. Too many famous names among those that are left \u2013 from oil to retailing \u2013 have been embroiled in scandals or have profound problems with their business model. There are only two hi-tech companies \u2013 ARM and Sage \u2013 represented in the FTSE 100. Fifty years ago there were dozens. Yet great companies are precious economic and social organisations. At their best, they are agencies for human betterment. If Britain is going to improve its economic and social performance, it needs more such companies, especially in the knowhow-driven economy of today. Their lack is an important reason for the decline in productivity growth. The chief explanation is that it has become too hard for British companies to pursue purposed, rounded business strategies. That is the proposition at the core of tomorrow\u2019s Big Innovation Centre Purposeful Company interim report, supported by more than a dozen companies (such as Kingfisher, GlaxoSmithKline, EY, Barclays, the Guardian Media Group and Infosys) as well as by other organisations including the Bank of England and Innovate UK. Successful companies are defined by their capacity to deliver and pursue clearly defined visionary corporate purposes \u2013 to be the best, to do business that is sustainable, to serve humanity, to stretch every muscle to innovate. Those purposes are not just rhetoric: they are binding commitments on the whole of an enterprise, from the board of directors to the shop floor, that generate trust. It is trust on which so much good business depends. No company attempting to be purposed pulls it off completely; the key is to try, and build the systems to make it happen \u2013 and it is this commitment that contributes to improved performance. Thus Ikea, Kingfisher and Uniqlo declare that their purpose is to make sure everyone can have what only a few can have \u2013 from improving their home to cheap clothes that are nonetheless high-fashion. As their purpose, Apple and the BBC strive for perfection in what they do; GlaxoSmithKline and Unilever declare their purpose is to do business that is sustainable and ethical. Unilever creates a \u201cmateriality\u201d map to ensure it is focused on what materially will deliver its declared purpose. Innovation is another compelling clarion call; the company\u2019s purpose is to go where no company has gone before \u2013 as ARM or Tesla declare. Other purposes range from treating stakeholders, including one\u2019s workforce and customers with integrity \u2013 John Lewis and more recently Barclays \u2013 or taking on the big boys and challenging the complacency of incumbents, like Uber or Ovo Energy. The evidence marshalled in the report suggests that purposed companies measurably \u2013 and here the report breaks new ground \u2013 innovate, invest and are more customer-centric than their non-purposed peers. Put another way, being non-purposed is costing the British economy up to \u00a3130bn a year of lost value generation. The precondition for rebalancing the economy or launching the march of the makers \u2013 preoccupations that stretch across the political spectrum \u2013 is to have a large and growing population of purposed firms. Yet too much in the British ownership, financial and innovation ecosystem militates against the delivery of purpose. The evidence is that British public companies have the most fragmented, diversified shareholder base \u2013 and fewer so-called external independent block shareholders \u2013 of any advanced industrial economy, including the US. There is thus a paucity of engaged owners. All advanced economies over the last 20 years, including China and Germany, have enlarged the rights of shareholders. But they have done so within financial frameworks that give company managements an array of devices to cement shareholder commitment \u2013 from making takeovers difficult to privileging founder shareholders with more voting rights, or allowing directors to have responsibilities to a wider range of stakeholders. They also have more sizeable block shareholders, which can act as engaged owners. Britain neither encourages block shareholding nor gives companies the freedom to protect purposed behaviour if they choose. Visionary purpose gets marginalised. The industry that manages Britain\u2019s long-term savings is hardly structured to make good the deficiencies. Long-term insurance companies and pension funds hardly invest in British companies any more; there are too many small pension funds, and too few have the incentive or resource to be in the business of stewarding companies. Stewardship, for all the warm words, codes and exhortation, is too often honoured in the breach rather than the observance. To make matters worse, the stock market is not very good at valuing investment in intangible \u201cknowhow\u201d assets like R&amp;D, patents, copyrights, or just straight investment in employees\u2019 skills. Yet intangibles, with their long-term returns, are already the bedrock of the 21st century economy, with investment running at twice the level of \u201ctangibles\u201d in factories and machines. British business investment in R&amp;D, even allowing for the shrunken size of manufacturing, is running below the international average and shrinking. Small wonder so many companies are retreating from the public markets \u2013 and that matters not only because, if public markets work well, they provide money at scale, but because they are the principal way in which the average person can share in wealth generation. What to do? There is no magic bullet, just a range of ideas \u2013 some big, some small \u2013 that cumulatively could make a difference. The interim report groups 20 policy options for change on which the Purposeful Company taskforce will be consulting over the next seven weeks. The first ideas cluster is to encourage companies, via their constitutions, practice and reporting, to take purpose more seriously. Executive pay should be geared to the results that engaged owners want over time, rather than just rewarding this year\u2019s profits. Secondly, Britain should consider introducing the tools that other countries permit to encourage shareholders to commit to companies \u2013 such as shares with differential voting rights. Thirdly, we need more blockholding and long-term shareholders. Next, the asset management industry needs a makeover itself; there are too many small pension funds and the stewardship code could be made tougher. Lastly, the decline in UK equity ownership needs to be reversed: the tax system favours debt, not equity, and there is a case for a British sovereign wealth fund to make good the equity shortfall. Too many of these propositions for too long have been regarded as the preserve of corporate governance nerds. Wrong. These issues are central not just to reviving the legitimacy of business by putting purpose at its heart \u2013 they are the key to creating long-term value for business and society. There is now a critical mass of companies and opinion emerging that could make real change happen. The task is to ensure that it does. The Big Innovation Centre Purposeful Company taskforce\u2019s interim report is released on Monday on www.biginnovationcentre.com",

      "body": "<p>There is a quiet crisis in British business. The number of quoted British public companies has halved over the past 15 years. Too many famous names among those that are left \u2013 from oil to retailing \u2013 have been embroiled in scandals or have profound problems with their business model. There are only two hi-tech companies \u2013 ARM and Sage \u2013 represented in the FTSE 100. Fifty years ago there were&#xa0;dozens.</p> <p>Yet great companies are precious economic and social organisations. At their best, they are agencies for human betterment. If Britain is going to improve its economic and social performance, it needs more such companies, especially in the knowhow-driven economy of today. Their lack is an important reason for the decline in productivity growth.</p> <p>The chief explanation is that it has become too hard for British companies to pursue purposed, rounded business strategies. That is the proposition at the core of tomorrow\u2019s Big Innovation Centre Purposeful Company interim report, supported by more than a dozen companies (such as Kingfisher, GlaxoSmithKline, EY, Barclays, the Guardian Media Group and Infosys) as well as by other organisations including the Bank of England and Innovate UK.</p> <p>Successful companies are defined by their capacity to deliver and pursue clearly defined visionary corporate purposes \u2013 to be the best, to do business that is sustainable, to serve humanity, to stretch every muscle to innovate. Those purposes are not just rhetoric: they are binding commitments on the whole of an enterprise, from the board of directors to the shop floor, that generate trust. It is trust on which so much good business depends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The industry that manages Britain\u2019s long-term savings is hardly structured to make good deficiencies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No company attempting to be purposed pulls it off completely; the key is to try, and build the systems to make it happen \u2013 and it is this commitment that contributes to improved performance. Thus Ikea, Kingfisher and Uniqlo declare that their purpose is to make sure everyone can have what only a few can have \u2013 from improving their home to cheap clothes that are nonetheless high-fashion. As their purpose, Apple and the BBC strive for perfection in what they do; GlaxoSmithKline and Unilever declare their purpose is to do business that is sustainable and ethical. Unilever creates a \u201cmateriality\u201d map to ensure it is focused on what materially will deliver its declared purpose.</p> <p>Innovation is another compelling clarion call; the company\u2019s purpose is to go where no company has gone before \u2013 as ARM or Tesla declare. Other purposes range from treating stakeholders, including one\u2019s workforce and customers with integrity \u2013 John Lewis and more recently Barclays \u2013 or taking on the big boys and challenging the complacency of incumbents, like Uber or Ovo Energy.</p> <p>The evidence marshalled in the report suggests that purposed companies measurably \u2013 and here the report breaks new ground \u2013 innovate, invest and are more customer-centric than their non-purposed peers. Put another way, being non-purposed is costing the British economy up to \u00a3130bn a year of lost value generation. The precondition for rebalancing the economy or launching the march of the makers \u2013 preoccupations that stretch across the political spectrum \u2013 is to have a large and growing population of purposed firms.</p> <p>Yet too much in the British ownership, financial and innovation ecosystem militates against the delivery of purpose. The evidence is that British public companies have the most fragmented, diversified shareholder base \u2013 and fewer so-called external independent block shareholders \u2013 of any advanced industrial economy, including the US. There is thus a paucity of engaged owners.</p> <p>All advanced economies over the last 20 years, including China and Germany, have enlarged the rights of shareholders. But they have done so within financial frameworks that give company managements an array of devices to cement shareholder commitment \u2013 from making takeovers difficult to privileging founder shareholders with more voting rights, or allowing directors to have responsibilities to a wider range of stakeholders. They also have more sizeable block shareholders, which can act as engaged owners. Britain neither encourages block shareholding nor gives companies the freedom to protect purposed behaviour if they choose. Visionary purpose gets marginalised.</p> <p>The industry that manages Britain\u2019s long-term savings is hardly structured to make good the deficiencies. Long-term insurance companies and pension funds hardly invest in British companies any more; there are too many small pension funds, and too few have the incentive or resource to be in the business of stewarding companies. Stewardship, for all the warm words, codes and exhortation, is too often honoured in the breach rather than the observance.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the stock market is not very good at valuing investment in intangible \u201cknowhow\u201d assets like R&amp;D, patents, copyrights, or just straight investment in employees\u2019 skills. Yet intangibles, with their long-term returns, are already the bedrock of the 21st century economy, with investment running at twice the level of \u201ctangibles\u201d in factories and machines.</p> <p>British business investment in R&amp;D, even allowing for the shrunken size of manufacturing, is running below the international average and shrinking.

      "bodyText": "Considering the historic apathy of the British public when it comes to switching their bank accounts, it seems apt that those tasked with writing a competition report on the topic don\u2019t seem in a terrible hurry to conclude. But on Tuesday the delayed investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority into retail banking reaches a critical phase with the publication of provisional remedies. High street banks will learn of a suite of recommendations aimed at making it easier for customers to move their current accounts \u2013to be followed by another month\u2019s consultation. The investigation, which was originally due to be concluded this month, was announced in July 2014, at a time of heightened political debate about the banking sector. Then Labour leader Ed Miliband was pushing for a break-up of the big four of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays. While these banks still control 77% of current accounts, such drastic moves rarely seem to happen in the banking industry \u2013 and almost certainly won\u2019t this week. For instance, despite it being a condition of its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008, and numerous aborted efforts, RBS has still to offload its 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches. Like switching accounts, that is something somebody might some day get around to. Standard Life chief in line for a pay battle And in this week\u2019s \u201cchief executive who irritated his shareholders to the point of revolt\u201d slot, we give you Keith Skeoch, the new boss of Standard Life. He belatedly twigged that he might be in line for a bit of a kicking at Tuesday\u2019s annual meeting, and last week attempted to head off an investor protest over his pay by cutting \u00a3700,000 off his potential \u00a33.5m bonus. A clash with investors would be particularly embarrassing given that Skeoch used to run the fund management arm, Standard Life Investments, which holds stakes in listed companies and often speaks out about boardroom excess. Still, the Edinburgh-based insurer announced after the stock market had closed on Wednesday that Skeoch would reduce his potential bonus to \u00a32.8m \u2013 400% of his \u00a3700,000-a-year salary \u2013 from the 500% that he had previously been awarded. The revision was announced a little over 24 hours before the deadline for shareholders to cast their votes ahead of the AGM. So, will it be enough? Investors are in an aggressive mood, having already voted against pay deals at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew during this AGM season. An offer they can refuse at Foxtons Elsewhere on the list of potential shareholder revolts this week comes Foxtons \u2013 the estate agent chain with such a cuddly image that it was once accused of giving its much-disliked sector a bad name. The firm is facing a possible rebellion over a 19% increase, to \u00a3550,000 a year, in the basic pay of chief executive Nic Budden, who seems immune to the embarrassment of having presided over a year in which the group\u2019s share price has fallen by more than 40%. Foxtons has argued that Budden had previously been paid at below the market rate, although the sales patter hasn\u2019t quite worked with an audience that seems to be sticking with the well-worn method of assessing estate agent behaviour: you can tell they are trying to shaft you when you see their lips move. Anyway, Institutional Shareholder Services \u2013 a shareholder adviser that represents 20% of UK stock market investors \u2013 and its rival Glass Lewis are both recommending votes against the remuneration report at the annual general meeting on Wednesday. So shareholders who invested in a company with a reputation for overpricing properties are set to get cross when the company does the same thing with the chief exec.",
