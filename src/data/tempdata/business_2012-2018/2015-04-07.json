      "bodyText": "British shoppers have enjoyed the biggest falls in the price of food, clothing and electrical goods for almost nine years, as supermarkets fight for customers and the global slump in oil prices continues to feed through to the high street. Prices in UK shops were 2.1% lower in March compared with a year ago, the biggest annual decline since the British Retail Consortium-Nielsen price index began in 2006. The BRC predicted that with consumer confidence high and incomes growing in real terms, shoppers would take advantage by stepping up the quantities they buy and also spend on affordable luxuries. Another closely watched survey showed that growth in the UK\u2019s dominant services sector moved to a seven-month high. According to the BRC-Nielsen index, food prices fell by 0.9% compared with a year ago, a record decline for the index and reflecting a fierce supermarket price war and sharp fall in oil prices. The biggest price drop was for fresh items such as milk, cheese, eggs, meat and vegetables, although some cupboard staples, including cereal and jam, also became cheaper. Non-food items fell at an even faster rate, decreasing on average by 2.8% year-on-year as retailers battled to offer discounts to cash-conscious shoppers. Clothing and footwear was 7.8% cheaper than a year ago, while electrical goods were 5.7% cheaper. Cheaper energy prices have helped bring inflation to zero, according to the latest government figures, lifting incomes in real terms and boosting the Conservative-led government in the runup to the general election on 7 May. February\u2019s consumer price index measure of inflation had dropped from 0.3% in January, raising the prospect of a deflationary period in the coming months. A sharp fall in oil prices \u2013 down from averages exceeding $110 a barrel before last summer to around $58.57 on Tuesday \u2013 has enabled retailers to offer consumers cheaper goods and petrol. Helen Dickinson, the BRC director general, said: \u201cWith strong consumer confidence and relatively benign macro-economic conditions, we can expect the nation to respond with their feet or with a mouse click in the coming weeks.\u201d Analysts questioned whether Britain was continuing to rely on consumer spending to boost growth while business investment, worker productivity and export growth remain lacklustre. The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 survey for the service industries, which account for about 77% of the UK economy, stood at 58.9 last month, up from 56.7 in February and comfortably beating City expectations of 57.

The survey data showed employment growth remaining close to record highs and that inflation showed few signs of picking up from its all-time low, Williamson added. Though companies complained that skills shortages were becoming a bigger problem and could soon put a brake on growth. The combination of accelerating business growth and falling prices presents a puzzle to the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, which is scheduled to announce its final interest-rate decision before the election on Thursday.

The next moment its role as lender of last resort takes the spotlight \u2013 and in that capacity another crunch moment arrives on Thursday when Greece either pays or reneges on \u20ac450m (\u00a3330m) it owes the Washington-based organisation. This debt, dating back to the highly contentious bailout of Athens by the IMF and Brussels in 2010, is one of a series of payments the Greeks will make with money borrowed from other sources as it rolls over and re-finances \u20ac320m of loans to public and private institutions. IMF boss Christine Lagarde would like us all to think that a Venn diagram of these two jobs as thinktank and lender would show little crossover. There are designated teams for each job and each has its own agenda. The crack team of auditors checking that pension payments to retired workers in Greece are valid is, literally, continents apart from the deep-thinking economists on Pennsylvania Avenue. Yet the remedies outlined by the IMF to counter the threat of persistent low growth in Britain and other developed world economies, as documented in that report, show that debt influences growth and in extremis can choke it off. The links need to be made, even if the IMF refuses to do so. In the report - Where are we headed, perspectives on potential output - the IMF says the world\u2019s major economies risk a long period of low growth unless governments do more to overcome the after-effects of the financial crisis and the longer-term problem of ageing populations. Looking forward, the IMF said potential growth in advanced economies was expected to increase slightly from an average of about 1.3% a year in the last six years to 1.6% until 2020, but not reach the 2.25% average seen between 2001 and 2007. Without a switch to policies that spur growth, it argues, governments would struggle to shift their debts. Among the list of policy reforms are demand-side measures such as greater spending on research and development, much\u2013needed infrastructure projects and a greater emphasis on workers\u2019 skills. On the supply side, tax reforms that make work pay. But growth is not the only way to diminish or pay back debts. Cancelling them is another. Banks do it with their worst performing customers. Unfortunately for Greece, the IMF refuses to use the same criteria as Lloyds or RBS would when confronted by a failed business. A couple of years ago the IMF admitted it made mistakes during the Greek bailout and hinted that it would have accepted weaker terms and possibly a debt write off. Now it\u2019s up to its neck in the EU\u2019s austerity politics, it cannot budge.",

      "bodyText": "Before we close up, here is a summary of the day\u2019s main events. Greece has vowed to meet Thursday\u2019s debt repayment deadline. It is scheduled to pay the IMF \u20ac450m (\u00a3330m) The country has also put a figure on what it believes it is owed by Germany in second world war reparations: \u20ac279bn Eurozone PMI surveys for March were largely positive, with Spain and Ireland ahead of the pack The UK services sector was booming in March according to the latest PMI survey, potentially handing George Osborne a pre-election advantage US and European markets rose Greece claimed the IMF is willing to afford the country the \u201cutmost flexibility\u201d on its reforms Greek PM Alexis Tsipras is hoping to agree a three-year plan of action when he meets Putin in Moscow on Wednesday, officials said. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for reading and commenting and please join us again tomorrow on a key day for Greece, as Alexis Tsipras heads to Moscow to meet Vladimir Putin. AM European markets have also built on earlier gains, boosted by a strong set of PMI surveys from the UK and eurozone this morning. FTSE 100: +1.6% at 6,944.39 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.1% at 12,104.24 France\u2019s CAC: +1.5% at 5,150.27 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.6% at 23,673.18 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +1% at 11,745.2 US markets have opened up. Dow Jones: +0.4% at 17,945.48 S&amp;P 500: +0.3% at 2,086.28 Nasdaq: +0.3% at 4,365.08 The International Monetary Fund has published part of its spring outlook this afternoon, ahead of the full publication next week. It says t world\u2019s major economies risk a long period of low growth unless governments do more to overcome the after-effects of the financial crisis and the longer term problem of ageing populations. The Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent Phillip Inman reports: Highlighting Germany, Canada and Japan as three of the worst affected countries, the IMF said that only by adopting a list of policy reforms that include greater spending on research and development, infrastructure projects and workers\u2019 skills could potential output be raised to nearer levels seen before the 2008 crash. It said governments should also consider action that also includes \u201cbetter designed tax and expenditure policies to boost labour force participation, particularly for women and older workers\u201d. Looking forward, the IMF said potential growth in advanced economies was expected to increase slightly from an average of about 1.3% a year in the last six years to 1.6% until 2020, but not reach the 2.25% average seen between 2001 and 2007. Read the full story here. Germany\u2019s economy minister has said his country is ready to help Greece and stay within the eurozone but it wasn\u2019t clear how Germany could help further. Speaking at the economy ministry in Berlin, Sigmar Gabriel said: This country is ready to help Greece get back on its feet - moreover in my firm opinion in the euro and not outside the euro. How one can do that, does still not appear to me to be very clear. He also criticised Greece\u2019s claim that it is owed \u20ac279bn by Germany in war reparations, saying it had nothing to do with negotiations on Greece\u2019s current debt crisis. Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Athens, has more details on the agenda for the Moscow meeting between Putin and Tsipras on Wednesday. Helena reports: The Greek government has announced that prime minister Alexis Tsipras will fly to Moscow, accompanied by a delegation of officials, at 4pm today. The far-left leader will meet president Vladimir Putin at 1pm local time, followed by a working lunch between the two men at 2pm. \u201cThe signing of documents takes place at 3:15pm,\u201d a government statement said. Senior officials are saying that \u201ca three-year plan of action\u201d in the fields of economy, commerce, research and technology are among the accords that are likely to be signed. A press conference by both leaders will be held at 3:30pm. Senior Syriza insiders are describing the visit as \u201cdiplomatically defined, politically friendly and economically promising\u201d. \u201cThe Greek prime minister will go wherever it is beneficial for Greece,\u201d one official was quoted as saying today. The Greek finance ministry has given a few more details following Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s meeting with IMF boss in Washington. Apparently Lagarde told the Greek finance minister the IMF was willing to be flexible over Greek reform proposals. The ministry said: Mrs Lagarde ... stressed that, in Greece\u2019s case, the Fund is willing to show utmost flexibility in the way in which the government\u2019s reforms and fiscal proposals will be evaluated. It added that in separate meetings, US Treasury officials who also met Varoufakis expressed the willingness of the US government to play the role of an \u201chonest broker\u201d in helping Greece to strike a deal with its lenders. A spokesman for Vladimir Putin, has reportedly been making comments ahead of the Russian President\u2019s meeting with Greek PM Alexis Tsipras on Wednesday. According to RIA Novosti, part of a state-owned news agency, Dmitry Peskov, said: There is no need to limit everything to credit and financial issues. Russian-Greek relations are quite multifaceted. They are much broader, and the entire range of relations will be discussed tomorrow. Asked whether the possibility of a gas discount would be discussed, he said: We do not rule out that these issues will also be raised. Sticking with Greece, there has been no let up on its insistence that it is owed reparations by Germany for the Nazi occupation of Greece during the war. Speaking on Monday, Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Germany owes the country nearly \u20ac279bn (\u00a3205bn). The Reuters story: Greece\u2019s deputy finance minister has said that Germany owes it nearly \u20ac279bn (\u00a3205bn) in reparations for the Nazi occupation of the country. Greek governments and private citizens have pushed for war damages from Germany for decades but the Greek government has never officially quantified its reparation claims. A parliamentary panel set up by Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government started work last week, seeking to claim German debts, including war reparations, the repayment of a so-called occupation loan that Nazi Germany forced the Bank of Greece to make and the return of stolen archaeological treasures. Speaking at a parliamentary committee on Monday, the deputy finance minister, Dimitris Mardas, said Berlin owed Athens \u20ac278.7bn, according to calculations by the country\u2019s general accounting office. The occupation loan amounts to \u20ac10.3bn. The campaign for compensation has gained momentum in the past few years as the Greeks have suffered hardship under austerity measures imposed by the European Union and International Monetary Fund in exchange for bailouts totalling \u20ac240bn to save Greece from bankruptcy. Tsipras has frequently blamed Germany for the hardship stemming from the imposition of austerity. The Greek prime minister has angered Berlin by threatening to push for reparations in the middle of talks to unlock aid for Greece. Germany has repeatedly rejected the country\u2019s claims and says it has honoured its obligations, including a 115m deutschmark payment to Greece in 1960. Over in Athens, the leading ATG share index is down 0.2% at 769.56, despite insistence from the Greek government that it is not about to default on its debt. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis met Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, in Washington on Sunday to reassure her a \u20ac450m (\u00a3330m) debt repayment due on Thursday would be honoured. This is what Lagarde said following the meeting: Minister Varoufakis and I exchanged views on current developments and we both agreed that effective cooperation is in everyone\u2019s interest. We noted that continuing uncertainty is not in Greece\u2019s interest and I welcomed confirmation by the Minister that payment owing to the Fund would be forthcoming on April 9th. I expressed my appreciation for the Minister\u2019s commitment to improve the technical teams\u2019 ability to work with the authorities to conduct the necessary due diligence in Athens, and to enhance the policy discussions with the teams in Brussels, both of which will resume promptly on Monday. I reiterated that the Fund remains committed to work together with the authorities to help Greece return to a sustainable path of growth and employment.\u201d Some more reaction now to those upbeat numbers from the UK services sector this morning. Samuel Tombs, Capital Economics: March\u2019s UK Markit/CIPS report on services provides further reassurance that the economic recovery is still on a fast track despite the uncertainty created by the upcoming general election. Martin Beck, EY Item Club: With the MPC beginning its April meeting today, the PMI release offers food for thought for the Committee\u2019s hawks and doves. For the former, services activity and employment continues to rise at a strong rate, while there is evidence of rising wage pressures in the sector. But for those more inclined to wait and see before hiking rates, March\u2019s services survey also offered support, showing growth in input costs remaining historically muted and output prices rising only fractionally. Overall, short of a marked rise in pay growth, we think that the MPC\u2019s doves will continue to win out over the hawks for the foreseeable future, with no hike in [interest rates] likely in 2015. Nick Beecroft, Saxo Bank: This morning\u2019s [composite PMI] for March will be extremely welcome news for the ruling Conservative party and Prime Minister Cameron. At 58.8, the figure beat expectations, (56.7), and is the highest reading since last August. The detail behind the headline number was also encouraging, with the driving force for the increase being a surge in the services PMI to 58.9 from 56.7, beating expectations for a reading of 57.0. As the services sector accounts for roughly 70% of the economy, and is sensitive to consumer confidence and behaviour, it appears that increases in living standards may finally be having a beneficial effect. Producer prices fell at an annual rate of 2.8% in February, a slower pace of decline than January when prices fell by 3.5%. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast annual factory gate deflation of 3%. On a monthly basis, producer prices actually rose by 0.5%, following a 1.1% fall in January. Economists had predicted a smaller rise of 0.1%. The increase was driven by a 2% rise in energy prices, and a 0.1% increase in consumer goods prices according to Eurostat, the eurozone\u2019s statistics agency. On a monthly basis, prices rose at the fastest pace in Greece, up 3.5%, and fell at the fastest rate in Slovakia, down 2.2%. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the data was the latest sign that eurozone deflation might be easing: The marked weakening in the euro, improving eurozone growth and a limited firming in oil prices from their January lows currently looks to be diluting the risk of prolonged eurozone deflation. Indeed, the eurozone could possibly exit deflation in April. Even if the eurozone does imminently exit deflation, it may still prove to be a hard slog to get eurozone consumer price inflation back up to the ECB\u2019s target rate of \u201cclose to, but just below 2%.\u201d Despite improving eurozone growth, underlying inflationary pressures across the region look set to be limited for some considerable time to come. The European Central Bank began a \u20ac1.1 trillion programme of quantitative easing last month, in an effort to boost growth and ward off the threat of a dangerous deflationary spiral. Inflation in the single currency bloc has been negative since December last year. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the PMI suggested the UK economy \u201cmoved up a gear in March\u201d. Combining the services PMI with the equivalent surveys from the manufacturing and construction sectors published last week, Markit says the UK economy probably grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2015. That would be a slight improvement on the fourth quarter of 2014, when the economy grew by 0.6%. We will have to wait until 28 March for the first official confirmation of Q1 GDP from the Office for National Statistics. Any improvement on Q4 2015 would hand the chancellor George Osborne a crucial advantage just one week before the polls open for the general election. Markit\u2019s Williamson: The three PMI surveys collectively indicate that the economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter, reviving from the slowdown seen late last year. Faster growth of new business and improved expectations of prospects for the year ahead also bode well for the upturn to retain strong momentum as we move through the spring. While the data support the view that the next move interest rates will be upward, the lack of inflationary pressures suggests the first hike remains some way off, and probably not this year unless we see some significant upturn in wage growth. The headline Markit/CIPS services PMI has beaten expectations, rising to 58.9 in March from 56.7 in February. It was the strongest since August 2014, and economists had forecast a lesser improvement to 57. New business growth was behind the jump in overall UK services sector activity in March. Confidence about the outlook meanwhile was the strongest in 10 months. So all in all, a broadly positive set of eurozone services PMI surveys has boosted the outlook for the broader economy. And certainly no nasty shocks. The UK services sector data is due at 9.30am so we\u2019ll bring you that very soon. Here is how the private sector in individual eurozone countries performed in March, combining the manufacturing and services sector PMIs. The higher the number above 50, the stronger the growth: Ireland: 59.8 (nine-month low) Spain: 56.9 (two-month high) Germany: 55.4 (eight-month high) Italy: 52.4 (eight-month high) France: 51.5 (two-month low) And here is how Markit\u2019s composite PMI survey\u2019s have tracked official GDP: Taken together, the services and manufacturing sector PMI data suggest the private sector boosted the eurozone economy in March, with the two sectors combined growing at the fastest rate in 11 months. The eurozone composite index climbed to 54 in March from 53.7 in February, putting the single currency bloc on course for 0.3% growth in the first quarter according to Markit - the same pace as the fourth quarter of 2014. The services index increased to 54.2 last month from 53.7 in February. Improvement was broad-based across services and manufacturing, but in terms of country performance, former bailout countries Ireland and Spain led the way. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit : Whether the eurozone economy has achieved escape velocity to enjoy a return to a strong and sustainable recovery remains uncertain, but the region is certainly seeing its best growth momentum since 2011. The PMIs are indicating somewhat sluggish GDP growth of 0.3% for the first quarter. However, the important message from the survey data is that the pace of expansion looks set to gather pace in coming months. Encouragingly, with France returning to growth, all of the four largest euro nations are now back in expansion, indicating a broad-based upturn which should therefore be more self-sustaining. An ongoing recovery is no one-way bet, however, with the Greek crisis remaining a critical threat to stability in the region. The headline services PMI rose to a six-month high of 55.4 in March from 54.7 in February. Rising new orders and employment boosted the sector in Europe\u2019s largest economy. \uf0a7Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit: Germany\u2019s service providers signalled a pick-up in activity growth at the end of the first quarter, with the headline index improving for the third month running. New business flooded in at the strongest rate since September of last year, with companies benefitted from an improving economic environment, which in turn encouraged them to further add to their payrolls. Survey data suggest that positive sentiment towards the 12-month outlook for business activity hit a four-year high in March, and companies were able to raise their charges to the greatest extent for nine months. PMI data also showed that the upturn in economic activity was broad-based, with manufacturers and service providers experiencing similarly strong rates of output growth. The French services PMI indicated slowing growth in March, with the headline index falling to 52.4 from 53.4 in February. It reflected a slowdown in new business growth. Employment in the sector grew for the first time in 17 months in March, albeit at a modest level. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit: The French service sector maintained its expansion in March, with activity and new business continuing to rise, albeit at slower rates. This offset a continued contraction of the manufacturing sector. PMI data suggest that private sector activity is likely to have made a small positive contribution to first-quarter GDP. Yet there remains little to suggest any sort of convincing recovery lies around the corner, as highlighted by service providers\u2019 business expectations dipping to a three-month low in the latest survey period. The headline index rose to 51.6 in March from the no-change level of 50 in February. New work rose at the fastest rate in eight months, ending four months of decline. Phil Smith, economist at Markit, said the latest survey was good news for the Italian economy overall: Although not quite the growth seen in manufacturing, the rise in business activity in the service sector is at least another sign that Italy\u2019s private sector economy is expanding. Furthermore, stronger inflows of new business bode well for the upturn being sustained. Based on the recent stream of PMI data, GDP is likely to have risen for the first time in more than a year in the first quarter, albeit probably only marginally. The survey data are also highlighting healthier trends in the labour market, with the combined rate of job creation in manufacturing and services the best seen for over four years. The unemployment rate is therefore likely to fall in coming months in a boost to the euro area\u2019s third-largest economy. The vast majority of FTSE 100 companies are up this morning, just four are down. Top performers: Worst performers: A quick look at the markets before we get the flurry of remaining eurozone services PMIs between 8.45am and 9am. All the major European indices are up. FTSE 100: +1.3% at 6,922.5 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.8% at 12,068.03 France\u2019s CAC: +0.7% at 5,111.79 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.1% at 23,555.48 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.6% at 11,707.5 Here is how Spain\u2019s PMI survey has tracked official GDP over the years. Spain\u2019s services sector performed strongly in March, with companies witnessing the sharpest rise in new orders in 15 years. The headline index on the Markit services PMI increased to 57.3 from 56.2. New orders rose at the sharpest pace since July 2000, and employment in the sector increased at the fastest rate since November 2007, before the financial crisis was unleashed on the global economy. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit: The highlight from the latest Spanish Services PMI is the sharpest monthly expansion in new business for almost 15 years as improving economic conditions encourage customers to commit to spending. The labour market continues to benefit from higher workloads, with staff taken on at a pace not seen since prior to the economic crisis. At 9.30 we have the closely watched Markit/CIPS services PMI for March. Economists are expecting the survey to show improvement, with the headline index forecast to rise to 57 from 56.7 in February, where anything above 50 indicates expansion. Britain\u2019s recovery to date has been heavily dependent on the services sector, which accounts for about three quarters of the economy. Services is the only key sector of the economy where output has now surpassed pre-crisis levels. The first official estimate of UK GDP for the first quarter will be published on 28 March, the week before the general election. The March services PMI will be scrutinised for signals about how the economy was doing at the end of the quarter. We also have all the eurozone services and composite PMI\u2019s coming up, starting with Spain at 8.15am. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has been in Washington DC to meet Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund. He told Lagarde Greece will be able to meet Thursday\u2019s deadline for a \u20ac450m (\u00a3330m) debt repayment. Greece is on a mission to convince its lenders that it is able to honour its debts and will not default. Ahead of the key deadline on Thursday, the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras will hold talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow. We will be bringing you all the latest Greek developments and other news as it happens.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned that the world\u2019s major economies risk a long period of low growth unless governments do more to overcome the after-effects of the financial crisis and the longer-term problem of ageing populations. The Washington-based organisation, best known for acting as lender of last resort to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, said without a switch to policies that spur growth, governments would struggle to shift excessive debts and cut long-term unemployment. Highlighting Germany, Canada and Japan as three of the worst-affected countries, the IMF said that only by adopting a list of policy reforms that include greater spending on research and development, infrastructure projects and workers\u2019 skills could potential output be raised to nearer levels seen before the 2008 financial crash. It said governments should also consider action that also includes \u201cbetter-designed tax and expenditure policies to boost labour force participation, particularly for women and older workers\u201d. Looking forward, the IMF said potential growth in advanced economies was expected to increase slightly from an average of about 1.3% a year in the last six years to 1.6% until 2020, but not reach the 2.25% average seen between 2001 and 2007. The warning comes in the IMF\u2019s spring outlook, part of which has been released ahead of its full publication next week. It marks a growing frustration in the organisation at the lack of action by governments after the flurry of activity following the banking crash. Output v pre-crisis expectations IMF officials are known to be concerned that the impetus for reforms has wained and in some cases descended into wrangling over bailout programmes, as is the case in Europe between Brussels and Athens. But the organisation has itself come under fire from critics who argue that it has forced countries such as Greece to adopt unsustainable debt repayment programmes, undermining their recovery. While the organisation is split between those who believe governments should emphasise public investment over supply-side reforms, such as cuts in subsidies and benefits, the report side-steps the need for organisations such as the IMF to write off some or all of the debts accumulated by countries worst hit by the 2008 crash. The UK escapes mention as one of the countries likely to be hit by declining labour participation rates after several years of policies that have increased immigration and encouraged greater participation by older workers and women. Since 2005, the UK\u2019s population has increased by almost 5 million to 64 million and its workforce reached a record of more than 30 million, partly offsetting a sharp rise in the number of pensioners. Recent employment figures have shown a jump in the number of over-50s in the workforce and those over 65 as employers look to retain those with high skills. Working age women have re-entered the labour market in greater numbers over recent years, partly in response to severe cuts in tax credit entitlements and other benefits affecting younger families and the equalisation of the pension age for women over 60. The IMF said the reduced prospects for potential growth \u201chave important implications for policy\u201d, especially as \u201clower potential growth will make it more difficult to reduce high public and private debt ratios\u201d and lock in low interest rates, making it more difficult for central banks to deal with future financial crises. It said: \u201cThe reforms needed to achieve this objective vary across countries. In advanced economies, these policies would involve product market reforms, greater support for research and development \u2013 including strengthening patent systems and adopting well-designed tax incentives and subsidies in countries where they are low \u2013 and more intensive use of high-skilled labour and information and communications technology capital inputs to tackle low productivity growth; infrastructure investment to boost physical capital; and better designed tax and expenditure policies to boost labour force participation, particularly for women and older workers.\u201d",

While the organisation is split between those who believe governments should emphasise public investment over supply-side reforms, such as cuts in subsidies and benefits, the report side-steps the need for organisations such as the IMF to write off some or all of the debts accumulated by countries worst hit by the 2008 crash. </p> <p> The UK escapes mention as one of the countries likely to be hit by declining labour participation rates after several years of policies that have increased immigration and encouraged greater participation by older workers and women. Since 2005, the UK\u2019s population has increased by almost 5 million to 64 million and its workforce reached a record of more than 30 million, partly offsetting a sharp rise in the number of pensioners. </p> <p>Recent employment figures have shown a jump in the number of over-50s in the workforce and those over 65 as employers look to retain those with high skills. Working age women have re-entered the labour market in greater numbers over recent years, partly in response to severe cuts in tax credit entitlements and other benefits affecting younger families and the equalisation of the pension age for women over 60.</p> <p>The IMF said the reduced prospects for potential growth \u201chave important implications for policy\u201d, especially as \u201clower potential growth will make it more difficult to reduce high public and private debt ratios\u201d and lock in low interest rates, making it more difficult for central banks to deal with future financial crises. </p> <p>It said: \u201cThe reforms needed to achieve this objective vary across countries. In advanced economies, these policies would involve product market reforms, greater support for research and development \u2013 including strengthening patent systems and adopting well-designed tax incentives and subsidies in countries where they are low \u2013 and more intensive use of high-skilled labour and information and communications technology capital inputs to tackle low productivity growth; infrastructure investment to boost physical capital; and better designed tax and expenditure policies to boost labour force participation, particularly for women and older workers.\u201d</p>",

The Bank\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) discussed the current account deficit at its most recent meeting in March and decided to keep it under close review, the meeting minutes showed. The current account deficit - which reflects the gap between money paid out by the UK and money brought in - improved in the final quarter, narrowing to just over \u00a325bn. But that was still worse than expected and the total 2014 figure was the worst for more than 60 years. For the 2014 year as a whole, the deficit totalled \u00a398bn, equal to 5.5% of GDP - the biggest deficit since records began in 1948. The FPC, whose job is to monitor and act on threats to UK financial stability, said there had been no big increase in domestic credit to fund the deficit and that if there was greater confidence in the economy the deficit would be easier to finance. But the minutes added: \u201cThe current account deficit was large and could, in adverse circumstances, trigger a deterioration in market sentiment towards the United Kingdom ... The committee agreed to keep their assessment of this risk under close review and would monitor the maturity and liquidity of the financing of the deficit.\u201d The FPC noted that at about 6% of GDP the current account deficit was high by historical UK standards and compared with other countries. The deficit in traded goods narrowed in the fourth quarter but the gap between income from UK assets overseas and from foreign-owned assets in the UK widened. Some economists have said Britain is storing up problems for the future and that George Osborne\u2019s goal of steering the economy away from domestic borrowing towards exports had not borne fruit. The FPC said the overall balance of risks to UK financial stability was roughly unchanged since its previous meeting in December. Falling oil prices and improving growth prospects in the eurozone were good developments but Greece\u2019s problems and China\u2019s slowdown were worries. Risks from the UK housing market and household debt had not risen since December but household indebtedness remained high. The FPC pointed out the increased use of interest-only mortgages by buy-to-let landlords and said it would monitor developments closely.",

      "bodyText": "A third major player in package delivery is expected to emerge in Europe following the announcement that the US parcel delivery giant FedEx has agreed to buy Dutch rival TNT Express for \u20ac4.4bn (\u00a33.2bn). The deal will give the US firm access to TNT\u2019s European road network, and create a substantial competitor to DHL and UPS. TNT\u2019s executive and supervisory boards have unanimously recommended the deal. Its largest shareholder, PostNL, has agreed to sell its 14.7% shareholding. FedEx will pay \u20ac8 in cash for every TNT share, a 33% premium over TNT\u2019s closing price of \u20ac6 in Amsterdam on 2 April. Two years ago, UPS tried to take over TNT but its \u20ac5.2bn bid was blocked by EU competition authorities. Unlike FedEx, UPS already had a strong European network when it made its \u20ac9.50 a share offer. That deal would have seen the creation of the biggest European group in the fight for the global parcel market. The deal was torpedoed after EU competition authorities said it would have restricted competition on the continent. Since then, TNT has revamped its business, selling operations and investing in its road network in a weak European market for business package deliveries. In a joint statement, FedEx and TNT said they would \u201ccooperate to avoid any significant redundancies in the global or Dutch workforces\u201d and \u201cexisting employment terms of TNT Express will be respected\u201d. They plan to keep TNT\u2019s hub in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, but will sell its airline operations in compliance with airline ownership regulations. Data from 2013 puts DHL at a 19% market share in Europe with UPS at 16% while TNT was at 12% and FedEx 5%. \u201cThis transaction allows us to quickly broaden our portfolio of international transportation solutions to take advantage of market trends \u2013 especially the continuing growth of global e-commerce \u2013 and positions FedEx for greater long-term profitable growth,\u201d FedEx CEO Frederick W. Smith said in the statement. Both FedEx and TNT Express said they were confident the deal will be passed by regulatory authorities. \u201cThe transaction will increase competition in Europe. We say a third strong competitor in this marketplace is essential,\u201d FedEx Express chief executive David Bronczek said. He said the FedEx and TNT Express networks are \u201cextremely complementary\u201d. \u201cTNT has an exceptional European road platform. It will greatly improve our ability to serve European customers,\u201d he said. \u201cFedEx has always been recognised to have a need for a stronger pan-European ground network to complement our strong intercontinental network.\u201d TNT chief executive Tex Gunning said the deal is \u201cmuch better and simpler\u201d than the UPS takeover. \u201cWhile we did not solicit an acquisition, we truly believe that FedEx\u2019s proposal, both from a financial and a non-financial view, is good news for all stakeholders,\u201d he said. \u201cOur people and customers can profit from the true global reach and expanded propositions, while with this offer our shareholders can already reap benefits today that otherwise would only have been available in the longer run.\u201d Gunning brushed off reports that the deal would lead to job cuts at TNT Express, which employs some 65,000 people worldwide. \u201cThere is little overlap, our businesses are complementary,\u201d he said. The two companies expect the deal to close in the first half of 2016. Andre Mulder, an analyst with financial services company Kepler Cheuvreux, said an opportunity for FedEx arose when the UPS deal was blocked. \u201cIt was a deal long overdue. I think FedEx was from the start the most logical partner of TNT. Because of its very low market share in Europe, I think it is better to buy a company in one stroke than to go through a lengthy process of buying all the companies in markets in Europe and integrate them,\u201d he said. \u201cBy acquiring TNT, FedEx gets a useful exposure on the ground in Europe.\u201d TNT TNT Express operates in more than 200 countries and maintains a leading role in the road freight network in Europe. The company went through extensive restructuring after the UPS bid failed, announcing in March 2013 that 4,000 jobs would be slashed \u2013 or 6% of its total workforce \u2013 over the next three years. FedEx FedEx employs more than 320,000 people worldwide with an annual turnover of $47bn. Based in Memphis, Tennessee, the company will finance the deal with debt. The company began operations on 17 April, 1973, when 14 aircraft took off from Memphis to deliver 186 packages to 25 cities following an idea which was sketched out by Fred Smith while studying at Yale eight years previously.",

At the same time, services firms reined in investment plans while the Greek crisis dragged the eurozone, Britain\u2019s biggest export destination, further into a political quagmire that was only alleviated by the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac1.1 trillion stimulus plan.</p> <p>The trend for slower growth continued into the post-Christmas period until the fall in oil prices fed through into lower costs for businesses and a much needed windfall for consumers.</p> <p>The PMI survey figure of 58.9, up from 56.7 the previous month, comfortably beat City expectations of 57 and increased the likelihood that the chancellor will go to the polls with the UK as one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economies. Readings above 50 signal growth of activity compared with the previous month.</p> <p>But there was a warning from some analysts that the figures show Britain is continuing to rely on consumer spending to boost growth while business investment, worker productivity and export growth remain lacklustre. </p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said surveys covering the services, construction and manufacturing sectors indicate that the economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter, reversing a slowdown seen late last year.</p> <p>\u201cThe combination of fuller employment and falling prices should support economic growth by providing an important catalyst to higher consumer spending, on which the upturn appears to have become increasingly dependent in recent months,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The survey data showed employment growth remaining close to record highs and that inflation showed few signs of picking up from its all-time low, he added. Though companies complained that skills shortages were becoming a bigger problem and could soon put a brake on growth.</p> <p>Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said a strong pipeline of new business contrasted with price-cutting to win business to give the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee food for thought.</p> <p>\u201cFor the [hawks on the committee], services activity and employment continues to rise at a strong rate, while there is evidence of rising wage pressures in the sector. But for those more inclined to wait and see before hiking rates, March\u2019s services survey also offered support, showing growth in input costs remaining historically muted and output prices rising only fractionally.\u201d<br></p> <p>He added: \u201cAnd with a healthy cocktail of low borrowing costs and rising real incomes, prospects for the services sector and the wider economy continue to look very bright.\u201d</p>",

With the economy expected to play an important role as the political parties get into their stride ahead of May 7, the acceleration in business activity plays well for the chancellor, especially as it reverses a trend in the second half of last year that saw most parts of the UK economy expand at a more anaemic pace. Figures for the construction and manufacturing sectors have shown growth slowing since last summer as businesses reacted to the faltering housing market and stagnating exports. At the same time, services firms reined in investment plans while the Greek crisis dragged the eurozone, Britain\u2019s biggest export destination, further into a political quagmire that was only alleviated by the European Central Bank\u2019s \u20ac1.1 trillion stimulus plan. The trend for slower growth continued into the post-Christmas period until the fall in oil prices fed through into lower costs for businesses and a much needed windfall for consumers. The PMI survey figure of 58.9, up from 56.7 the previous month, comfortably beat City expectations of 57 and increased the likelihood that the chancellor will go to the polls with the UK as one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economies. Readings above 50 signal growth of activity compared with the previous month. But there was a warning from some analysts that the figures show Britain is continuing to rely on consumer spending to boost growth while business investment, worker productivity and export growth remain lacklustre. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said surveys covering the services, construction and manufacturing sectors indicate that the economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter, reversing a slowdown seen late last year. \u201cThe combination of fuller employment and falling prices should support economic growth by providing an important catalyst to higher consumer spending, on which the upturn appears to have become increasingly dependent in recent months,\u201d he said. The survey data showed employment growth remaining close to record highs and that inflation showed few signs of picking up from its all-time low, he added. Though companies complained that skills shortages were becoming a bigger problem and could soon put a brake on growth. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said a strong pipeline of new business contrasted with price-cutting to win business to give the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee food for thought. \u201cFor the [hawks on the committee], services activity and employment continues to rise at a strong rate, while there is evidence of rising wage pressures in the sector. But for those more inclined to wait and see before hiking rates, March\u2019s services survey also offered support, showing growth in input costs remaining historically muted and output prices rising only fractionally.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd with a healthy cocktail of low borrowing costs and rising real incomes, prospects for the services sector and the wider economy continue to look very bright.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The decision now for the RBA board is whether to cut in May \u2013 a week before Joe Hockey hands down the budget \u2013 or to wait and see what the government has planned before cutting June. The RBA\u2019s statement concluded that \u201cfurther easing of policy may be appropriate over the period ahead, in order to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation consistent with the target\u201d. Such wording \u2013 the same as last month \u2013 ensures that the market will continue to expect the bank to cut in the next few months. The RBA gave few new reasons for its decision. It essentially released the same statement as it did last month \u2013 when rates were also kept on hold. It did note again note that \u201clending to businesses... has been strengthening recently\u201d, and crucially with respect to house prices that \u201cdwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities\u201d. The RBA also said that the exchange rate, while lower than 12-18 months ago, is likely to fall further given the falls in commodity prices. \u201cA lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy\u201d. This would indicate that the bank expects the dollar should fall below US$0.75, and perhaps if it does not, it will again look to cut rates as a means of causing the value of the dollar to fall.\u201d So the RBA has kept the cash rate on hold at 2.25%. It is a decision that has surprised the market \u2013 which had priced in a 75% chance of a cut. Here\u2019s that spike in the dollar The stock market has also dropped about 0.5%, but it remains ahead on where it started the day. Not surprisingly, the value of the dollar jumped about 1% straight away, but it is now steady at around US$0.767 The media release is a virtual cut and paste of last month\u2019s. The bank sees the economy is growing weakly, and knows there is a lot of \u201cspare capacity\u201d (i.e. unemployed and idle machinery), but it seems it actually wants to wait to see if there is any impact from the last interest rate cut in February before moving again. Here\u2019s the statement from the Reserve Bank (my summary to follow): At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent. Moderate growth in the global economy is expected in 2015, with the US economy continuing to strengthen, even as China\u2019s growth slows a little from last year\u2019s outcome. Commodity prices have declined over the past year, in some cases sharply. The price of oil in particular is much lower than it was a year ago. These trends appear to reflect a combination of lower growth in demand and, more importantly, significant increases in supply. The much lower levels of energy prices will act to strengthen global output and temporarily to lower CPI inflation rates. Prices for key Australian exports have also been falling and therefore Australia\u2019s terms of trade are continuing to decline. Financial conditions are very accommodative globally, with long-term borrowing rates for several major sovereigns at all-time lows. Financing costs for creditworthy borrowers remain remarkably low. In Australia the available information suggests that growth is continuing at a below-trend pace, with overall domestic demand growth quite weak as business capital expenditure falls. As a result, the unemployment rate has gradually moved higher over the past year. The economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. With growth in labour costs subdued, it appears likely that inflation will remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate. Credit is recording moderate growth overall. Growth in lending to investors in housing assets is stronger than to owner-occupiers, though neither appears to be picking up further at present. Lending to businesses, on the other hand, has been strengthening recently. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have risen, in part as a result of declining long-term interest rates. The Australian dollar has declined noticeably against a rising US dollar over the past year, though less so against a basket of currencies. Further depreciation seems likely, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. A lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy. At today\u2019s meeting the Board judged that it was appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the time being. Further easing of policy may be appropriate over the period ahead, in order to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation consistent with the target. The Board will continue to assess the case for such action at forthcoming meetings So with the decision about to occur lets have a recap: For a cut: The economy is not growing fast enough to get unemployment down Mining investment is falling off a cliff - we need the non-mining sector to get in the game The approvals of the building of houses seems to have hit a plateau Job adverts have hit a plateau The exchange rate is low, but perhaps should be lower. The market expects a cut! For a hold: Only cut rates in February - let\u2019s wait and see Housing prices in Sydney are still pretty hot - and there are concerns of a glut in apartments in places like Melbourne Rates are already at 2.25% - unheard of levels! - will a cut at this point actually change anyone\u2019s behaviour? We wait and see what the bank does\u2026 So how low are home loan rates at the moment? The RBA provides figures for the average standard variable rate, and the \u201cdiscount\u201d rate \u2013 which most banks offer, and which most people get at least for the first few years of their loan. Currently the average standard variable loan is 5.65% , a 0.25% pts cut would take that to 5.4% - the last time rates were that low was 1968. Yep, we\u2019re at a point of seeing rates as low as a time when we had yet to put a man on the moon. The average discount rate is currently 4.8%. The RBA only has figures for such rates back to 2002. But the lowest the standard variable rate has been since 1959 is 5.0%, so it is pretty clear we\u2019re in very strange territory. A cut today would mean any more cuts would have the cash rate starting with a \u201c1\u201d, and that is pretty amazing \u2013 and something I never thought I\u2019d see. Of course it is not just about home loans. The decision will affect savers as well \u2013 especially those self-funded retirees who gain income from interest on term deposits. While the average six months term deposit rate is still a little bit lower than the level they reached during the GFC, they are still well below what savers would have been accustomed to over the past 15 years: With inflation running at around 2.2%, the average term deposit rate of 2.35% is barely offering a real return. Even the \u201cspecial\u201d rate offered by banks of around 2.7% is providing a real return of only around 0.5% \u2013 well below the average real rate over the past 15 years of around 1.1%: Another reason the RBA could consider cutting rates is our exchange rate. A lower value of our dollar assists our export industries \u2013 as it makes it cheaper to buy Australian goods and services (and more expensive to buy imports). When the RBA began cutting rates in November 2011 the Australian dollar was worth around US$1.03. Now it is trading at around US0.76: Some believe that given the falls in commodity prices like iron ore, the value of our dollar should be lower \u2013 nearer to US$0.70. One way to help that happen is to cut rates. Given that the market expects the RBA to be more likely to cut rates than not, if the RBA does keep rates on hold, it will be interesting to see what happens to the value of the dollar. Foreign exchange rate dealers are jittery folk who react to the slightest bit of news \u2013 even if it is expected news. But unexpected news can see big dives or falls. While most expect a cut of 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points), the bank can cut by more if it chooses to. Given the market expect at least two more rate cuts this year, the bank could decide to make a bold statement and cut by 50 basis points. Such a move might actually provide a bit of a shock to the economy \u2013 especially if there was the sense that that was as low as the bank was going to cut them. It might actually get those businesses who perhaps are waiting for lower rates to start investing. Or it might just send the whole economy into a panic! One other big issue for the RBA is the falling price of iron ore. It\u2019s now down to around US$46.70 a tonne \u2013 well down on the $US136 a tonne price that was going less than 18 months ago. That translates to mining industry investment falling much, much faster than either the bank or the government would like. So how to get investment going in the non-mining sector? The RBA hopes lower interest rates. But how much will it help is the big question. While small business lending rates are not at 40 year lows as is the case with mortgage rate, they are still as low as they have been in the past 10 years: Will another rate cut see small businesses invest more than they currently are? Those who oppose a cut argue it won\u2019t, and all it will do is fuel investors to borrow money to buy houses rather than entice people to borrow to build a house The problem for the RBA is that many believe a spark has already been set off in the housing market. House price rises in Sydney and Melbourne \u2013 driven by investors \u2013 have many worried that rates cuts are just fuelling a housing bubble. However, last weeks housing data suggests that the level of building activity has come off the boil somewhat. The building approvals data showed that dwelling unit approvals (which includes houses and dwelling apartments) has improved over the past year \u2013 and is growing strong than it was six months ago: But one problem with that data is that figures for non-house dwelling units \u2013 apartment buildings and flats \u2013 can be a bit jumpy due to the local government approval process. If we just look at the growth of private sector house building approvals, the picture is much less buoyant. Every state saw weaker growth than 12 months ago, and across all there was in effect 0% growth in new houses approved to be built. The RBA wants a strong construction sector to take up the big slack from the falling mining industry. These figures would have them wanting to cut rates. There\u2019s been a bit of economic news around today that could have an impact on the RBA\u2019s decision. The NAB job advertisement survey fell for the first time in 10 months. Fewer job adverts means less economic activity, and thus furthering the case for a rate cut. Last week the ABS\u2019s quarterly job vacancy data was released. It showed a very slight increase of 1.1% in job vacancies from November last year to February this year. Annual growth also remained weak: The figures translate to little change in the fight for jobs. Across the country there are around 5.2 unemployed per job vacancy \u2013 a slight increase on this time last year: South Australia remains the hardest state to find work \u2013 with around 7.3 unemployed per vacancy. Western Australia \u2013 despite a worsening jobs market, remains the best place with 4.4 unemployed per vacancy just ahead of NSW with 4.4 unemployed per vacancy. Overall, however, the lack of improvement suggest an economy in need of some sort of a spark. Since the last rate cut in February, the market has continued to predict further interest rate cuts: Even if the RBA cuts rates today, the market expects more to follow \u2013 and has become more bullish about the likelihood of further cuts over time. In February, the market believed 2.0% was about as low as the RBA would go. Now the market is even predicting a chance of rate being cut all the way to 1.50%. As I noted yesterday, the market can often get it wrong, but it is rare that the RBA bucks the predictions of the market in the short term \u2013 so if it doesn\u2019t cut rates today there is likely to be a lot of movement on the exchange rate and on the share market. The case for making the cut is however not clear cut. Many economists have in fact taken a contrary position to the market and believe the bank will keep rates on hold. The economy is growing below trend and unemployment has been rising slowly, but steadily \u2013 which would suggest the need for a rate cut to help stimulate the economy. But with housing prices have been rising solidly over the past 12 to 18 months, economists believe another rate cut could help fuel a housing bubble. Hello and welcome to our live blog on the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s announcement on interest rates. Just two months since it last cut interest rates, the Reserve Bank today is expected to announce at 2:30pm it has again lowered the cash rate \u2013 this time to a record low of 2.0%. Currently the market believes there is a 75% chance that the bank will cut the cash rates. If it does, standard variable mortgage rate will fall to the lowest rates since 1968.",

Lending to businesses, on the other hand, has been strengthening recently. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have risen, in part as a result of declining long-term interest rates.</p> <p>The Australian dollar has declined noticeably against a rising US dollar over the past year, though less so against a basket of currencies. Further depreciation seems likely, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. A lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy.</p> <p>At today\u2019s meeting the Board judged that it was appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the time being. Further easing of policy may be appropriate over the period ahead, in order to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation consistent with the target. The Board will continue to assess the case for such action at forthcoming meetings</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55235c66e4b0711a4eadb176\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-07T04:27:24.730Z\">5.27am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">The arguments for and against a cut to interest rates</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>So with the decision about to occur lets have a recap:</p> <p><strong>For a cut:</strong></p> <p>The economy is not growing fast enough to get unemployment down</p> <p>Mining investment is falling off a cliff - we need the non-mining sector to get in the game</p> <p>The approvals of the building of houses seems to have hit a plateau</p> <p>Job adverts have hit a plateau</p> <p>The exchange rate is low, but perhaps should be lower.</p> <p>The market expects a cut!</p> <p><strong>For a hold:</strong></p> <p>Only cut rates in February - let\u2019s wait and see</p> <p>Housing prices in Sydney are still pretty hot - and there are concerns of a glut in apartments in places like Melbourne</p> <p>Rates are already at 2.25% - unheard of levels! - will a cut at this point actually change anyone\u2019s behaviour?</p> <p><br>We wait and see what the bank does\u2026</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-04-07T04:29:27.573Z\">at 5.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-55235c07e4b0f0f0388f2786\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-07T04:25:34.733Z\">5.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>So how low are home loan rates at the moment?</strong></p> <p>The RBA provides figures for the average standard variable rate, and the \u201cdiscount\u201d rate \u2013 which most banks offer, and which most people get at least for the first few years of their loan.<br></p> <p>Currently the average standard variable loan is 5.65% , a 0.25% pts cut would take that to 5.4% - the last time rates were that low was 1968.<br></p> <p>Yep, we\u2019re at a point of seeing rates as low as a time when we had yet to put a man on the moon.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 6\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/g3rnd/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The average discount rate is currently 4.8%.

A lower value of our dollar assists our export industries \u2013 as it makes it cheaper to buy Australian goods and services (and more expensive to buy imports).</p> <p>When the RBA began cutting rates in November 2011 the Australian dollar was worth around US$1.03. Now it is trading at around US0.76:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/uGAPO/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Some believe that given the falls in commodity prices like iron ore, the value of our dollar should be lower \u2013 nearer to US$0.70. One way to help that happen is to cut rates.</p> <p>Given that the market expects the RBA to be more likely to cut rates than not, if the RBA does keep rates on hold, it will be interesting to see what happens to the value of the dollar.</p> <p>Foreign exchange rate dealers are jittery folk who react to the slightest bit of news \u2013 even if it is expected news. But unexpected news can see big dives or falls.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55235a40e4b0b3f858ca6c13\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-07T04:17:41.249Z\">5.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While most expect a cut of 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points), the bank can cut by more if it chooses to. Given the market expect at least two more rate cuts this year, the bank could decide to make a bold statement and cut by 50 basis points.</p> <p>Such a move might actually provide a bit of a shock to the economy \u2013 especially if there was the sense that that was as low as the bank was going to cut them. It might actually get those businesses who perhaps are waiting for lower rates to start investing.<br></p> <p>Or it might just send the whole economy into a panic!<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-552358e9e4b0b3f858ca6c12\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-07T04:14:50.305Z\">5.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One other big issue for the RBA is the falling price of iron ore. It\u2019s now down to around US$46.70 a tonne \u2013 well down on the $US136 a tonne price that was going less than 18 months ago.</p> <p>That translates to mining industry investment falling much, much faster than either the bank or the government would like.<br></p> <p>So how to get investment going in the non-mining sector? The RBA hopes lower interest rates.<br></p> <p>But how much will it help is the big question. While small business lending rates are not at 40 year lows as is the case with mortgage rate, they are still as low as they have been in the past 10 years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"graph 4\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/8XI7H/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Will another rate cut see small businesses invest more than they currently are?</p> <p><br>Those who oppose a cut argue it won\u2019t, and all it will do is fuel investors to borrow money to buy houses rather than entice people to borrow to build a house</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-552357a8e4b0b06bd4eab4da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-07T04:10:51.784Z\">5.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The problem for the RBA is that many believe a spark has already been set off in the housing market.
