      "bodyText": "Amid all the talk of RBS and Lloyds returning to private hands and predictions that the economy will begin growing again, if a little slowly and unevenly, it must be tempting for politicians to think the financial crisis is a matter for historians. That would be a comforting thought if it were not for the prospect of the next crash, which could be as little as 13 years away. The crash is likely to arrive pretty much on schedule in 2025 for several reasons, one of them being that they tend to happen every 18 years. That was the gap between the 1989 recession and 2007's Northern Rock collapse. There was also a similar gap after the housing crash of the early 1970s. What's to say the next will be more than 18 years away? Whatever the date, how prepared are we, and have we done anything to calm the forces that, for some time now, have caused one boom and bust after another? There are people inside government and the Treasury who are well aware that the seeds of the boom are already in the system. And aware that the government is equally ill-prepared to withstand the shock of a bust. The tax system is a particular problem. It is hotly contested whether the former Labour government spent freely ahead of the financial crash and landed its successor with huge debts as a result. As many economists have documented, a little extra spending ahead of the crash was not Gordon Brown's worst mistake, it was the reliance for his spending on taxes that disappeared overnight when the recession hit. Key taxes fell off a cliff, most of them related to the astonishing property boom that many people, eminent economists and policymakers among them, believed would go on forever. In August 2007 house sales were running at 164,000 a month. A year and the Lehman Brothers crash later and they were running at 72,000. The latest figures for December 2012 show there were 52,700 transactions, which was 13% more than the year before. This collapse in house sales sparked a sharp fall in stamp duty receipts. In 2008 they topped \u00a314bn. By April 2010 this crucial prop for government spending had declined to \u00a35bn. In the current year, a rise in house sales is expected to bring stamp duty land tax (SDLT) back to \u00a33.1bn, combined with almost \u00a33bn of receipts from stamp duty on share sales. But while the share sales element is expected to continue raking in \u00a33bn until the end of the Treasury's time horizon of 2018, SDLT will zoom back to \u00a312.2bn. In effect, the Treasury is expecting the housing boom to be back in full swing five years from now. Capital gains tax, a charge largely on property sales, will double, from \u00a33.7bn in this financial year to \u00a37.4bn in 2018. Most other sources of revenue are expected to remain flat or grow in line with inflation with the exception of income tax and national insurance. As unemployment falls, income tax receipts are expected to grow quickly, from \u00a3154bn today to \u00a3206.5bn in 2018. So the scenario for 2025 appears eerily similar to the horror story that began to unfold in 2007. A trigger, such as a rise in interest rates, pops a housing boom that in turn puts thousands of people out of work. Banks complain that loans will go unpaid and consider foreclosing on indebted families and businesses. To stop this happening, the government steps in with housing benefit payments and tax credits for poorer families and corporation tax relief for companies. Income declines while the costs of running the government soar. Housing benefit jumped from around \u00a310bn to \u00a321bn after the latest crash. Tax credit payments soared by more than \u00a310bn to \u00a328bn in 2012. The coalition has put in place a new system of financial regulation that ministers believe will monitor the situation. Various watchdogs will be expected, like a parent at their son's 18th birthday, to turn on the lights when there is a whiff of over-exuberance. Of course, regulators may have the required tenacity and moral fervour to confront the banks several years from now, when the housing boom is under way and the City sniffs vast profits, and tell them the party is over, or that they must at least calm down. Should they succeed, the banks will be less overextended. But the UK's big four \u2013 or maybe it will be six or seven by then \u2013 will still need a bailout, having only just recovered from the current mess. But relying on regulators is always likely to prove a fool's game when the property industry, which is a powerful lobbyist, and the City join together to persuade ministers that the housing market is sailing along nicely. Ministers, just as they were before the crash, will see the tax receipts flowing in. The OECD, the Paris-based thinktank, has argued that western welfare capitalism needs a rethink. No longer should governments rely so heavily on income taxes and transaction taxes, which are cyclical and encourage gambling on property at the expense of paid work. We need to switch to wealth and consumption taxes. The west has wealth and not income, at least not in the way it once did, so it makes sense for governments to make the switch. Not to a jewellery tax, which Vince Cable dismissed last week, but to a tax on land that encourages building and discourages speculative hoarding. At current rates of building, Britain's largest housebuilders are sitting on around four years of land with planning permission, waiting for the most profitable moment to build. Property is an obsession in the UK and the disease has spread to many parts of continental Europe. Land taxes, combined with lower income taxes, offer the prospect of a cure. Boffins at the OECD put forward their scheme to encourage growth. That's their primary objective. But a healthy side-effect would be to mitigate the forces that deny governments the means to cope with recessions.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece was heading for a full-on collision with its international creditors on Sunday as Athens' uneasy coalition, struggling to meet the onerous terms of the country's latest bailout, ruled out layoffs in the public sector. Flying into the capital at the start of a quarterly review of the debt-choked economy, mission heads from the EU, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank were told flatly that mass firings were out of the question when unemployment had reached a European record of 27%. \"The public sector has shrunk by 75,000 people in the last one and a half years,\" the finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, told a newspaper in a taste of the stiff resistance the auditors are likely to meet. \"There will be no layoffs.\" The Eurogroup of finance ministers is expected to discuss the dire situation in Greece and Cyprus, which has asked for a bailout worth almost 100% of its national income. Stournaras, a technocrat widely credited with smoothing often fraught relations between Greece and its foreign lenders, has encountered mounting hostility from within the tripartite government over the dismissals. Athens agreed to cut 150,000 posts from its unwieldy public sector by 2015 as part of a wide-ranging package of austerity reforms promised when the \"troika\" unlocked \u20ac54bn in long overdue aid in December. Under that plan, 25,000 employees were to be transferred this year to a \"mobility\" scheme, the first step towards redundancy. Streamlining so far has relied on a policy of natural attrition, with only one person being hired for every 10 who retire. But the conservative-led administration has faced growing pressure from its leftwing junior partners. Acutely aware of the country's economic tailspin, Fotis Kouvellis, who leads the Democratic Left, has warned that with 1.4 million Greeks now unemployed, the prospect of yet more losing work could threaten the fragile social peace. Mired in what economists are calling a \"great depression\", with its GDP set to contract for a sixth straight year, Greece is projected to see unemployment exceed 30% by the year's end as a growing number of businesses file for bankruptcy. Over 60% of those without work are under 25. Public-sector firings are among a series of neuralgic points likely to be raised by the troika. Representatives, who indicated they would not be visiting Athens \"to renegotiate its rescue package but supervise its economic performance\", are also expected to address the thorny issues of progress on privatisations, tax administration reforms and bank recapitalisation. Paitence is in short supply. Creditors have committed more funds to Greece \u2013 at \u20ac240bn, the biggest bailout in world history \u2013 than any other troubled economy since the tiny nation, revealing the unsustainable level of its public debt, triggered the eurozone crisis in late 2009. Piling on the pressure ahead of the monitors' visit, the Euro Working Group chief, Thomas Wieser, emphasised that Athens had to keep its side of the deal. \"All that was agreed in the bailout plan has must be implemented. These reforms were agreed to make the Greek economy stronger, flexible and more competitive,\" he told the Greek newspaper Realnews. Although the IMF has publicly admitted that it seriously underestimated the impact of Greece's recession on its ability to deliver, there are growing concerns over the government's determination to crack down on tax collection \u2013 the single biggest drain on the country's economic performance. A confidential report prepared by the EU and IMF and leaked to the Greek media last week showed that the nation was lagging severely in key revenue targets, with Athens' tax collection mechanism being singled out for particular criticism. While Greece had managed to rein in public spending \u2013 pulling off the biggest fiscal consolidation of any OAED country \u2013 tax avoidance, particularly among high earners, remained \"astounding\", said the report, estimating that at \u20ac55bn unpaid tax amounted to nearly 30% of GDP. Indicative of the febrile mood enveloping Greece, the radical left Syriza opposition party said that in light of the missed targets, it was clear the coalition partners were preparing new wage and pension cuts. \"They are discredited and dangerous,\" it said in a statement. \"The sooner they leave, the better for Greek society and the economy.\"",

    "webTitle": "Bank bonuses may shrink \u2013 but watch as the salaries rise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "No one should be under the illusion that European legislation curbing bankers' bonuses to a mere doubling of an employee's salary will end the public debate about high levels of banker compensation. Call me cynical, but the legislation might have a marginal effect at best. What is more likely is that information about those City employees who get excessive compensation will be hidden in other cost lines, such as salaries, making it more difficult for shareholders, policymakers and the press to gain an accurate perspective on what is actually being paid out. Legislation and regulation has not persuaded senior management at banks to feel compelled to engage in real dialogue and strategy with regard to whether the overall compensation levels are truly value for money. Most bank senior managers, particularly in investment banking and some wealth management businesses, are not as concerned about the quality of work and conduct of their employees as they are about what to do if their bonus-compensated staff leave. These managers are often charged with a revenue and profit target, and their staff, in turn, are seen as conduits to clients who pay the bank a lot of money for advice, trading capability and expertise. If a team leader, department manager or division head loses a key employee \u2013 usually those who earn the high bonuses \u2013 the main concern is whether that employee will take his or her clients, contacts and expertise to a competitor and therefore cost the bank income, which affects managers' own revenue targets. The reasons employees move to competitors can be many, but in more than 20 years of working in the City about half of my former employees who announced their resignation left for a similar job in another company with higher overall compensation; the other half were lured back with salary rises, bonus adjustments and title changes. Yes, since the 2008 credit crunch and the subsequent furore over bonuses, many banks have chosen to raise the base salaries of staff and lower their bonuses. In addition, most of the big players are requiring bonuses to be withheld for three to five years. But the overall amounts of potential compensation have changed only slightly. Senior managers in large global investment banking groups will also face conflicts with their counterparts in Asia and the US, though President Barack Obama has in the past hinted at attempting a cap on Wall Street too. In European and British banks, managers will find themselves limiting the bonuses of their staff while watching other global competitors pay much higher bonuses as they will not be operating under such strict rules. It is highly likely that base salary levels will then rise further in Britain and Europe, and the more variable bonus component reduced to come into line with the new standards. British and European banks will not just stand by and watch their investment banking businesses disintegrate. Still, what is disappointing about the current situation is the fact that few senior executives and bank boards have led the bonus and compensation discussions and tried to shape the industry's future from within. After all, the European Union's law limiting bonus compensation, and the local regulatory efforts, are only coming to pass because these actions are not being taken in the boardrooms of the leading banks, or within their trade associations. Some banks have hired new chairmen who have a good understanding of reputation management, but most are leaving the compensation dialogue to remuneration committees. Those committees, in turn, seem to leave the compensation issues to executive managements, which seem to maintain nearly unchanged strategies about the levels of total compensation. A number of institutions have tried to rebrand, and suggest that their values have changed and that the businesses are now customer- and shareholder-centric. But in most instances, the people who were managing these businesses under the old structure are still in place running the newly aligned organisations. All this suggests little original thinking about compensation is taking place at the top and that despite shareholder dissatisfaction and political pressure, and the fact that some CEOs are publicly turning down high annual bonuses, neither legislation nor regulation will have much of an impact unless the banking world really looks inside itself and honestly claims that high compensation is a necessary requirement for a successful business.

      "body": "<p>No one should be under the illusion that European legislation curbing bankers' bonuses to a mere doubling of an employee's salary will end the public debate about high levels of banker compensation. Call me cynical, but the legislation might have a marginal effect at best. What is more likely is that information about those City employees who get excessive compensation will be hidden in other cost lines, such as salaries, making it more difficult for shareholders, policymakers and the press to gain an accurate perspective on what is actually being paid out.</p> <p>Legislation and regulation has not persuaded senior management at banks to feel compelled to engage in real dialogue and strategy with regard to whether the overall compensation levels are truly value for money.</p> <p>Most bank senior managers, particularly in investment banking and some wealth management businesses, are not as concerned about the quality of work and conduct of their employees as they are about what to do if their bonus-compensated staff leave. These managers are often charged with a revenue and profit target, and their staff, in turn, are seen as conduits to clients who pay the bank a lot of money for advice, trading capability and expertise. If a team leader, department manager or division head loses a key employee \u2013 usually those who earn the high bonuses \u2013 the main concern is whether that employee will take his or her clients, contacts and expertise to a competitor and therefore cost the bank income, which affects managers' own revenue targets.</p> <p>The reasons employees move to competitors can be many, but in more than 20 years of working in the City about half of my former employees who announced their resignation left for a similar job in another company with higher overall compensation; the other half were lured back with salary rises, bonus adjustments and title changes. Yes, since the 2008 credit crunch and the subsequent furore over bonuses, many banks have chosen to raise the base salaries of staff and lower their bonuses. In addition, most of the big players are requiring bonuses to be withheld for three to five years. But the overall amounts of potential compensation have changed only slightly.</p> <p>Senior managers in large global investment banking groups will also face conflicts with their counterparts in Asia and the US, though President Barack Obama has in the past hinted at attempting a cap on Wall Street too. In European and British banks, managers will find themselves limiting the bonuses of their staff while watching other global competitors pay much higher bonuses as they will not be operating under such strict rules. It is highly likely that base salary levels will then rise further in Britain and Europe, and the more variable bonus component reduced to come into line with the new standards. British and European banks will not just stand by and watch their investment banking businesses disintegrate.</p> <p>Still, what is disappointing about the current situation is the fact that few senior executives and bank boards have led the bonus and compensation discussions and tried to shape the industry's future from within. After all, the European Union's law limiting bonus compensation, and the local regulatory efforts, are only coming to pass because these actions are not being taken in the boardrooms of the leading banks, or within their trade associations.</p> <p>Some banks have hired new chairmen who have a good understanding of reputation management, but most are leaving the compensation dialogue to remuneration committees. Those committees, in turn, seem to leave the compensation issues to executive managements, which seem to maintain nearly unchanged strategies about the levels of total compensation.</p> <p>A number of institutions have tried to rebrand, and suggest that their values have changed and that the businesses are now customer- and shareholder-centric. But in most instances, the people who were managing these businesses under the old structure are still in place running the newly aligned organisations. All this suggests little original thinking about compensation is taking place at the top and that despite shareholder dissatisfaction and political pressure, and the fact that some CEOs are publicly turning down high annual bonuses, neither legislation nor regulation will have much of an impact unless the banking world really looks inside itself and honestly claims that high compensation is a necessary requirement for a successful business.</p> <p>Investment banking chiefs, though, may be seriously wondering whether it is worth being tied up with the retail and commercial operations of a large universal bank. Capital requirements are changing and retail operations will have to be ringfenced anyway; it might be time to separate these organisations completely. At the point where European parliamentarians can see that investment bankers are no longer in charge of retail clients and no longer the burden on the taxpayer that many of them once were, lawmakers might then start being more generous to investment banks.</p> <p><em>Rob Taylor is a former chief executive of Kleinwort Benson bank and has worked in financial services for more than 20 years.

      "bodyText": "Multiplying lanes, stretching runways and new terminals in the sands may not be everyone's idea of making the desert bloom. But in Abu Dhabi, where the aviation industry has grown up almost as spectacularly as the skyscrapers on the shoreline, the sheikhs who bankrolled the towering investment do not doubt that the fruits will come. While London's great and good grapple with the question of airport expansion, the world beyond is changing, as those running Britain's biggest airport and airline know all too well \u2013 frequently expressing their frustration that rivals are \"eating our lunch\" and leapfrogging them to aviation's top spot. The announcements last week that Etihad Airways \u2013 based in Abu Dhabi \u2013 was splurging $70m (\u00a347m) to secure three Heathrow slots, while British Airways saw its profits wiped out and its parent company, IAG, record a near-\u20ac1bn (\u00a3863m) loss, will not have made them much happier. \"In aviation,\" says Jos Nuihuis, the boss of Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, mischievously enjoying his role as the current chief beneficiary of Heathrow's inability to build another runway, \"you have to take the chance when it's your turn.\" While the northern hemisphere and transatlantic traffic draws the money, Europe's five hubs can do battle. But the political geography is changing and the crossroads of the world look ever more likely to be located in the Middle East. Developments at the three expanding hubs in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates underline that shift. The UAE's biggest airline, Emirates, last month completed the opening of an entire 20-gate concourse at its Dubai airport base purely for its fleet of giant A380s, Airbus's flagship aircraft which typically carry 500-plus passengers. Etihad \u2013 which was established less than a decade ago \u2013 announced that passenger numbers had passed 10 million a year and it was turning increasing profits, as plans to double the airport capacity take shape. And in Qatar, the $15.5bn Hamad International airport opens next month with a 4,850m runway fit for fleets of A380s to take off in the desert heat. The ambition is immense, as is the speed and scale of the growth to date. Qatar's airport will be able to handle 28 million passengers a year on opening, but chief executive Akbar al-Baker is planning extensions for 50 million by 2020, when the state hosts the football World Cup. In the gleaming new headquarters of Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi, the airline's chief executive, James Hogan, spells out a vision of being a \"truly global airline\". Staff drawn from 125 countries come through the training facility on site, the graduating class photos spreading along the walls showing a multinational mix in each intake. With 70 planes, Etihad is the smallest of the Gulf airlines, and all three have orders that will more than double their existing fleets. \"With aircraft technology you can fly to all points in the world from the Gulf,\" Hogan says. \"We fly to 86 cities and connect well [at] Abu Dhabi, and Abu Dhabi itself as a destination is becoming more relevant.\" For many British passengers, long-haul to the south and east of the globe has meant going on the classic Kangaroo route to Australia via Asia. But the longer range of modern aircraft and the rise of the Gulf hubs has set a new course for the Gulf and south east Asia. Etihad's investment in, and partnership with, Virgin Australia is one way that the journey now bypasses Singapore and Heathrow too. More notably, at the end of this month Emirates will take over from the ousted British Airways in a partnership with Australian flag carrier Qantas. Qantas's UK general manager, Eric Jelinek, said it was an \"amicable divorce\" from Heathrow's largest carrier: \"BA understands our reasons and that things have changed.\" He doesn't extend the metaphor, but has the air of a man whose airline has found a younger, richer, more glamorous partner, really going places and unsullied by previous trysts. This is Emirates' first alliance, and Qantas is clearly overjoyed to have been chosen. For its Australian passengers flying via Heathrow, it offered five European destinations, with two stops. Now it can sell 33 with just the one stop. Qantas has since reported a surge in ticket sales from Australia to Europe. The Gulf hubs are undoubtedly well-placed to update some long-established routes. As Hogan, a native Australian, puts it: \"It's the new Silk Road.\" But, he adds: \"What people forget is that India, Pakistan, Bangladesh are huge populations. And even in the Middle East: at a point, post-Arab spring, when the Middle East normalises, Iraq and Iran have huge numbers of young people who want to travel. \"If you think within three hours' flying time we have India \u2013 for them this is a weekend destination, a short break destination, an educational or medical care destination. \"You want sun, beaches, restaurants, shopping, it's here all year round. The Gulf states, the subcontinent and the Middle East all see Abu Dhabi as a destination in its own right, as well as all the through traffic.\" If Dubai's tourist industry and hotel scene is well-established, Abu Dhabi has plans to make a different type of tourist sit up, with a new Louvre, Guggenheim and national museum in fantastical designs from the world's leading architects on a newly linked island on the city's edge. Such breathtaking, vaulting ambition typifies the Gulf but also leads many observers to question if these are Ozymandian dreams, unsustainable follies in the sand. Can the vast oil wells in the desert successfully nurture not just one but three burgeoning aviation hubs, two within an hour's drive of each other? John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, believes so: \"Probably they can. If you look at where they're sitting and the aircraft they're operating, they can serve pretty much anywhere in the world. None of them are having any difficulty filling their planes.\" Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, predicts: \"They will grow very seriously and gain status as major global aviation hubs. They sit at the crossroads from Europe to the east and between Africa and Asia, which are young and vibrant markets.\" But the backing of their governments has, he says, been the driver that has capitalised on that geographical logic. Strickland points out that, while the political aspirations of the various emirates mean that all want their own flag carrier and hub, and are backing aviation to the hilt, all three airlines are believed to be heading for profitability (although the accounts are not all transparent). \"You're not talking about carriers which are bleeding as businesses or in terms of the profits.\" Etihad's own strategy of investing in partner airlines is questioned by some analysts \u2013 \"when you see them buying parts of Air Seychelles or Air Berlin you do wonder what they're doing,\" says one \u2013 but the depth of the airline's pockets is emphasised by moves to take a major stake in Indian airline Jet to secure its three Heathrow slots. \"Remember that the European flag carriers are retreating,\" Hogan says. \"You're not going to see them operating into Tripoli, Basra, Baghdad.\" Not to mention other destinations closer to home: \"We fly into Manchester. BA isn't flying out of Manchester.\" This, says Strickland, shows where Gulf airlines can directly compete with Heathrow right now. \"While we're agonising about runways in the south-east, they have no capacity constraint and can offer a very attractive proposition to travellers in the UK. If you're in Manchester or Newcastle you can bypass London altogether.\" Intriguingly, Heathrow boss Colin Matthews \u2013 who now counts Qatar's sovereign wealth fund as a major shareholder with a 20% stake and has Al-Baker on his board \u2013 has started to make a virtue of the growth of the Gulf hubs, as well as Istanbul. He twice suggested at a business event last week that projections of growing passenger demand in the UK might have to be downplayed as aviation's focus shifts, meaning that a third runway, rather than a new four-runway facility outside London, might be sufficient for future needs. Scant consolation, perhaps, for a struggling European aviation industry that could do without the competition \u2013 and unfair competition with subsidised fuel, some have complained, although Hogan says it is \"a myth\" that he has access to free kerosene or money. Strickland, though, suggests that the future is one where the Gulf players become ever more prominent, but also more integrated \u2013 and those that embrace them will do best. \"Capacity constraints here are going to help their growth, and some of the markets are ones that Europe cannot access. Traffic flows such as China to Africa or even Asia to Latin America are going to be the great growth of the 21st century.\" Instead, European long-haul airlines might, Strickland suggests, have to emulate a Ryanair-style model on a global basis. Passengers now are used to taking an Irish plane from Stockholm to Madrid. That possible evolution might mean BA flying passengers from Latin America to China via a future BA base \u2013 in Dubai. Meanwhile, Europe's aviation industry has to get used to the fact that the Gulf money it has seen splashed again last week has radically tilted aviation's playing field, even more than the sponsorship of Man City and Paris St Germain has skewed football. Even the analyst who questions Etihad's investment strategy, likening it to the ill-fated SwissAir that was dragged under by partner airlines, points to an essential difference: \"Switzerland has got a lot of chocolate. And the UAE has got a lot of oil.\"",

Qatar's airport will be able to handle 28 million passengers a year on opening, but chief executive Akbar al-Baker is planning extensions for 50 million by 2020, when the state hosts the football World Cup.</p> <p>In the gleaming new headquarters of Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi, the airline's chief executive, James Hogan, spells out a vision of being a \"truly global airline\". Staff drawn from 125 countries come through the training facility on site, the graduating class photos spreading along the walls showing a multinational mix in each intake.</p> <p>With 70 planes, Etihad is the smallest of the Gulf airlines, and all three have orders that will more than double their existing fleets. \"With aircraft technology you can fly to all points in the world from the Gulf,\" Hogan says. \"We fly to 86 cities and connect well [at] Abu Dhabi, and Abu Dhabi itself as a destination is becoming more relevant.\"</p> <p>For many British passengers, long-haul to the south and east of the globe has meant going on the classic Kangaroo route to Australia via Asia. But the longer range of modern aircraft and the rise of the Gulf hubs has set a new course for the Gulf and south east Asia. Etihad's investment in, and partnership with, Virgin Australia is one way that the journey now bypasses Singapore and Heathrow too. More notably, at the end of this month Emirates will take over from the ousted British Airways in a partnership with Australian flag carrier Qantas.</p> <p>Qantas's UK general manager, Eric Jelinek, said it was an \"amicable divorce\" from Heathrow's largest carrier: \"BA understands our reasons and that things have changed.\"</p> <p>He doesn't extend the metaphor, but has the air of a man whose airline has found a younger, richer, more glamorous partner, really going places and unsullied by previous trysts. This is Emirates' first alliance, and Qantas is clearly overjoyed to have been chosen. For its Australian passengers flying via Heathrow, it offered five European destinations, with two stops. Now it can sell 33 with just the one stop. Qantas has since reported a surge in ticket sales from Australia to Europe.</p> <p>The Gulf hubs are undoubtedly well-placed to update some long-established routes. As Hogan, a native Australian, puts it: \"It's the new Silk Road.\" But, he adds: \"What people forget is that India, Pakistan, Bangladesh are huge populations. And even in the Middle East: at a point, post-Arab spring, when the Middle East normalises, Iraq and Iran have huge numbers of young people who want to travel.</p> <p>\"If you think within three hours' flying time we have India \u2013 for them this is a weekend destination, a short break destination, an educational or medical care destination.</p> <p>\"You want sun, beaches, restaurants, shopping, it's here all year round. The Gulf states, the subcontinent and the Middle East all see Abu Dhabi as a destination in its own right, as well as all the through traffic.\"</p> <p>If Dubai's tourist industry and hotel scene is well-established, Abu Dhabi has plans to make a different type of tourist sit up, with a new Louvre, Guggenheim and national museum in fantastical designs from the world's leading architects on a newly linked island on the city's edge.</p> <p>Such breathtaking, vaulting ambition typifies the Gulf but also leads many observers to question if these are Ozymandian dreams, unsustainable follies in the sand. Can the vast oil wells in the desert successfully nurture not just one but three burgeoning aviation hubs, two within an hour's drive of each other?</p> <p>John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, believes so: \"Probably they can. If you look at where they're sitting and the aircraft they're operating, they can serve pretty much anywhere in the world. None of them are having any difficulty filling their planes.\"</p> <p>Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, predicts: \"They will grow very seriously and gain status as major global aviation hubs. They sit at the crossroads from Europe to the east and between Africa and Asia, which are young and vibrant markets.\" But the backing of their governments has, he says, been the driver that has capitalised on that geographical logic.</p> <p>Strickland points out that, while the political aspirations of the various emirates mean that all want their own flag carrier and hub, and are backing aviation to the hilt, all three airlines are believed to be heading for profitability (although the accounts are not all transparent). \"You're not talking about carriers which are bleeding as businesses or in terms of the profits.\"</p> <p>Etihad's own strategy of investing in partner airlines is questioned by some analysts \u2013 \"when you see them buying parts of Air Seychelles or Air Berlin you do wonder what they're doing,\" says one \u2013 but the depth of the airline's pockets is emphasised by moves to take a major stake in Indian airline Jet to secure its three Heathrow slots.</p> <p>\"Remember that the European flag carriers are retreating,\" Hogan says. \"You're not going to see them operating into Tripoli, Basra, Baghdad.\" Not to mention other destinations closer to home: \"We fly into Manchester. BA isn't flying out of Manchester.\"</p> <p>This, says Strickland, shows where Gulf airlines can directly compete with Heathrow right now. \"While we're agonising about runways in the south-east, they have no capacity constraint and can offer a very attractive proposition to travellers in the UK. If you're in Manchester or Newcastle you can bypass London altogether.\"</p> <p>Intriguingly, Heathrow boss Colin Matthews \u2013 who now counts Qatar's sovereign wealth fund as a major shareholder with a 20% stake and has Al-Baker on his board \u2013 has started to make a virtue of the growth of the Gulf hubs, as well as Istanbul. He twice suggested at a business event last week that projections of growing passenger demand in the UK might have to be downplayed as aviation's focus shifts, meaning that a third runway, rather than a new four-runway facility outside London, might be sufficient for future needs.</p> <p>Scant consolation, perhaps, for a struggling European aviation industry that could do without the competition \u2013 and unfair competition with subsidised fuel, some have complained, although Hogan says it is \"a myth\" that he has access to free kerosene or money.</p> <p>Strickland, though, suggests that the future is one where the Gulf players become ever more prominent, but also more integrated \u2013 and those that embrace them will do best. \"Capacity constraints here are going to help their growth, and some of the markets are ones that Europe cannot access. Traffic flows such as China to Africa or even Asia to Latin America are going to be the great growth of the 21st century.\"</p> <p>Instead, European long-haul airlines might, Strickland suggests, have to emulate a Ryanair-style model on a global basis. Passengers now are used to taking an Irish plane from Stockholm to Madrid. That possible evolution might mean BA flying passengers from Latin America to China via a future BA base \u2013 in Dubai.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Europe's aviation industry has to get used to the fact that the Gulf money it has seen splashed again last week has radically tilted aviation's playing field, even more than the sponsorship of Man City and Paris St Germain has skewed football. Even the analyst who questions Etihad's investment strategy, likening it to the ill-fated SwissAir that was dragged under by partner airlines, points to an essential difference: \"Switzerland has got a lot of chocolate. And the UAE has got a lot of oil.\"</p>",

Buying local food is one way out of this impasse. But we can't leave it to shoppers. Big retail sells over 90% of the food we eat at home.

      "bodyText": "Jamie Doward's review of the state of British farming reminds us that the challenges of the food system are broader than those exposed by the horsemeat scandal (\"British farming in crisis as crop losses from 'relentless' flooding pile up woes\", News). He rightly asks whether demand for British food can cause a long-term shift in the prospects for British farming. It's essential we as shoppers look to a wider set of values, including who produces our food and how, as well as the effects on local businesses and the town and countryside. Buying local food is one way out of this impasse. But we can't leave it to shoppers. Big retail sells over 90% of the food we eat at home. Until government policy starts to support greater retail diversity, supermarkets must assume the main responsibility for paying food producers a fair price that takes into account the cost of production to give British farming a future. Graeme Willis Campaign to Protect Rural England, London SE1 Charter for cover-ups We are deeply concerned by the justice and security bill. It was drafted in response to legal cases involving allegations of UK complicity in secret rendition, torture and inhumane treatment. The bill is a charter for cover-ups. Neither the public, nor the victims, nor their lawyers nor the media will have a right to know. Court records could be kept secret forever. Secret courts could be extended to undercover police officers, deaths of suspects in custody and deaths in the military. The measures in the bill are an attack on open and accessible justice, they threaten the right to a fair trial and the rule of law. Journalism at its best uncovers the truth and the bill intends to hide the evidence. We are asking MPs to make their vote count and oppose the secret courts proposals in the justice and security bill next week.
