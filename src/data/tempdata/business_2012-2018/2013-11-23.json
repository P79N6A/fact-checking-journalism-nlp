    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two and a half years ago, on a crisp spring afternoon in Glasgow, the Reverend Paul Flowers, chairman of the Co-operative Bank, was having a jolly time of it. After he'd enjoyed the hospitality of the directors' box at Glasgow's Hampden stadium, Flowers' broad features gave away his immense personal satisfaction at the cacophony of noise that greeted his handing over of the Co-operative Insurance Cup to Rangers captain David Weir. He even offered a small cheer. It was, a rueful Labour MP admitted last week, rather typical of the flamboyant, 63-year-old Flowers. \"He loved the limelight and I suppose, well, people just thought: that's Paul.\" That slight unease, sometimes made audible at Co-op meetings in the form of a nervous laugh at the chairman's latest extravagance, or a gentle tut-tut at his florid language and overbearing nature, has metamorphosed into a veritable roar of outrage in the past week. On 13 November an acquaintance of Flowers phoned the news desk of the Mail on Sunday offering a trove of information on the Methodist minister-turned-councillor-turned-banker. Four days later the paper published, under the eye-grabbing headline \"Crystal Meth Shame of Bank Chief\", three pages of allegations, including incriminating text messages and video footage, reporting on purchases of Class A substances ranging from cocaine to ketamine and his hopes for a \"drug-fuelled gay orgy\". Flowers' statement to the paper conceded that, while under pressure from work and following the death of his mother Muriel, he had, at his \"lowest point\", done some things that were \"stupid and wrong\". The past seven days have rather put that statement into context. The next day's Daily Mail published claims from a male escort, Ciaron Dodd, 21, that Flowers had hired him for sex, and had written unguarded messages to him from a Co-op email address. One said: \"Been waiting for you to come and have some coke [cocaine] and k [ketamine] with me. P x.\" In another, when Dodd asked if he could bring his friend Lucas, Flowers responded: \"I like him a lot \u2013 but I can't afford 2 of you this time! PXx.\" Within 24 hours it emerged that Flowers had two previous criminal convictions: one for gross indecency after he was caught performing a sex act with a man in a public toilet in 1981, and another for drink driving. It emerged that he had had to resign from Bradford council as recently as September 2011 when pornography, described as \"inappropriate but not illegal\", was found on his work laptop, and that he had resigned as deputy chairman of Co-op Group in June because of board concerns about his \"excessive\" use of expenses before being forced out of the chairmanship of Co-op Bank because of doubts over his competence. A major loser in this story has been Flowers himself. It is difficult to recall a more extraordinary personal and professional implosion. He was arrested in Liverpool and driven to a police station in Leeds for questioning in what West Yorkshire police described as an \"ongoing drug supply investigation\" before being bailed. And perhaps we should spare a thought for the Manchester Lads escort agency, through which Flowers met Dodd. In a statement posted on a gay and bisexual escort blog, Men of the UK, the owner of the agency lamented the breakdown in the oath of secrecy between rent boy and punter. It read: \"In the 11-year history of Manchester Lads, nothing like this has ever happened before. The majority of the escorts I list are decent people who provide complete discretion for their customers.\" Amen to that, as Reverend Flowers might say. But there have been, arguably, more significant victims, and it is here where this story will prove to have some way to go. On 20 November for those listening carefully, the death knell of the historic links between the Co-op group and the Labour party could be heard emanating from a private meeting in the House of Commons' Boothroyd room, overlooking the Thames. MPs who are members of both the Labour party and the Co-operative party, a sister organisation effectively subsumed into the bigger organisation in 1927, met to read the runes and, for those of the 32 Labour/Co-op MPs who attended, the tidings were not good. The Co-op has informed senior Labour figures of impending funding cuts of at least a third, but worse is expected. Barry Sheerman, Labour and Co-op member for Huddersfield for over three decades, reported back: \"There is no doubt that there is going to be a 30% cut across the board, it was explained to the political group.\" The cuts, as they are, will be highly significant for Labour, given the decision by the GMB to cut its funding to Labour MPs by 90% from \u00a31.2m to \u00a3150,000 a year, and concerns that other affiliated unions will follow. The Co-op group donates less than the GMB to Labour MPs: \u00a3880,000 in 2012, \u00a3861,500 in 2011 and \u00a3860,000 in 2010, but the loss of up to \u00a3300,000 next year would be highly unwelcome to the MPs whose offices are run using that cash. The unappealing truth, though, is that such a cut is not expected to be the end of it. The Co-op has been on the brink of collapse ever since it discovered a \u00a31.5bn black hole in its finances during its ill-fated attempt to buy 631 Lloyds branches. That has already ushered in major changes to the Co-op Bank, with two major US hedge funds \u2013 Silver Point Capital and Aurelius \u2013 due to take a 70% stake, leaving the group with just 30%. But it has also opened up a new world of possibilities for how the Co-op group as a whole could be shaped. And if those seeking reform of the group \u2013 and what critics say would be an abandonment of its history \u2013 were in a strong position a few weeks ago, last week's storm can only have strengthened their hand. When the deal for the bank was announced there was much talk of retaining the Co-op tradition. But that tradition is now tarnished, and the reformers have the whip hand. One senior Labour figure admitted: \"I get the impression that the new chief executive, Euan Sutherland, isn't much of a Labour fan. I wouldn't rule out it all being cut.\" The break-up of the relationship between Labour and the Co-op, which is what many fear is now on the cards, would not sit easy with many, Sheerman included. \"We can accept a budget cut, but what must happen is that the values and relationships with Labour should be reaffirmed,\" he said, \"There would be a terrible knock-down, drag-out fight if anyone tried to depoliticise the Co-op movement.\" Well, that fight might well be on. The Co-op has hired as advisers the reputation management firm Quiller Consultants, which has offices close to Buckingham Palace and is run by Sean Worth, a special adviser to David Cameron until last year and a former head of the Tory party's policy unit in opposition. Worth will soon take over leadership of Quiller from George Bridges, a former political secretary to John Major, when Bridges moves to Santander in January. Quiller's role is unknown but is highly unlikely to involve a reconfirmation of the ties with Labour. When approached, Worth emailed: \"We are advising The Co-operative Group, as we declare on the Association of Professional Political Consultants register, but do not discuss client matters.\" The second significant victim of the Flowers farce, some fear, may well be the concept of mutualism \u2013 customers having a stake in the business \u2013 itself. The image of Flowers, sitting in front of the Commons treasury select committee failing to provide an accurate value for the bank's assets (he said \u00a33bn; the actual figure is \u00a347bn) is a nightmare for those who fear \"demutualisation of the Co-op group by the back door\", as one MP described it last week. The subsequent humiliation heaped on the unfortunate Flowers only added to the concerns of some about the principle of the man on the street, the amateur, being elected to the board of what is today a major company. An analysis published in the Daily Telegraph encapsulated the argument of the reformers: \"Business novices can be good at spotting emperor's clothes in boardrooms but banking demands professionalism.\" And the new management team led by Sutherland, who has been recruited from B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher, has already suggested that they are looking at wider changes than even the Telegraph piece suggests. They have set up a review of practices, under Sir Christopher Kelly, into the decision-making process that led to the accumulation of the group's financial black hole. The board is currently made up of 20 elected members from the 7.9 million owner-members of the group and the 80 independent societies \u2013 an arrangement about which many members are proud. But the group's annual report shows that just 222,221 individual members voted in 2011, and Len Wardle, the chairman who stepped down last week in acknowledgement of his role in appointing Flowers to chair the bank, has already been urging his fellow members to change the structure. He has suggested that his eventual successor \u2013 one of three deputies, Ursula Lidbetter, has been hastily appointed, but probably temporarily \u2013 should come from outside the membership. Rumours abound that Kelly has already decided that a key recommendation of his review, to be published next May, will be for the 20-strong board be cut to eight \u2013 and for all the democratically elected positions to be scrapped. Many fear that this is where the momentum lies. Sitting in his office in Manchester, Rob Harrison, editor of Ethical Consumer magazine and flag-waver for the Save our Bank campaign, says he is up for a battle for the bank and the wider group. His take, and that of his staff, is that attacks from the media, and from the Conservative party, over the rise of the democratically elected Flowers, is missing the point. \"This is a problem with banks, not Co-ops or mutuals,\" he said. \"There is lots of political interest in kicking mutuals. But one of the fundamental principles of directly elected mutual societies is that you need to spend lots of money on training people because they aren't necessarily going to turn up with all you need to manage a complicated company. And for me it would be far better to look at what is in place to train members to be effective directors. \"No one is arguing that the mutual model is superior because people who don't know a thing are going to sit on boards. We are arguing that it is morally superior because customer-controlled organisations are fantastic.\" On Friday, George Osborne ordered regulators to appoint a high-profile name to lead an independent investigation into what went wrong at the Co-operative Bank. And here may be the third significant victim of the last week: the regulators and the Treasury, which appear not to have been paying attention as the Co-op was going off the tracks. John Woodcock, Labour and Co-op MP for Barrow and Furness, said the movement would not go down without a fight. \"Others need to think very carefully about the course they have embarked on this week \u2013 attacking an institution that they said they supported until recently. That is a real risk I can see to the Co-op Bank \u2013 an assault on the Co-op's values.\"",

      "body": "<p>Two and a half years ago, on a crisp spring afternoon in Glasgow, the Reverend Paul Flowers, chairman of the Co-operative Bank, was having a jolly time of it. After he'd enjoyed the hospitality of the directors' box at Glasgow's Hampden stadium, Flowers' broad features gave away his immense personal satisfaction at the cacophony of noise that greeted his handing over of the Co-operative Insurance Cup to Rangers captain David Weir. He even offered a small cheer. It was, a rueful Labour MP admitted last week, rather typical of the flamboyant, 63-year-old Flowers. \"He loved the limelight and I suppose, well, people just thought: that's Paul.\"</p> <p>That slight unease, sometimes made audible at Co-op meetings in the form of a nervous laugh at the chairman's latest extravagance, or a gentle tut-tut at his florid language and overbearing nature, has metamorphosed into a veritable roar of outrage in the past week.</p> <p>On 13 November <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2508464/Crystal-meth-shame-Co-op-bank-chief-Paul-Flowers.html\" title=\"\">an acquaintance of Flowers phoned the news desk of the <em>Mail on Sunday</em> offering a trove of information on the Methodist minister-turned-councillor-turned-banker</a>. Four days later the paper published, under the eye-grabbing headline \"Crystal Meth Shame of Bank Chief\", three pages of allegations, including incriminating text messages and video footage, reporting on purchases of Class A substances ranging from cocaine to ketamine and his hopes for a \"drug-fuelled gay orgy\".</p> <p>Flowers' statement to the paper conceded that, while under pressure from work and following the death of his mother Muriel, he had, at his \"lowest point\", done some things that were \"stupid and wrong\".</p> <p>The past seven days have rather put that statement into context.</p> <p>The next day's <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2510241/Paul-Flowers-escort-Ciaron-Dodd-reveals-drug-fuelled-sex-rooms-paid-Co-op.html\" title=\"\"><em>Daily Mail </em>published claims from a male escort, Ciaron Dodd</a>, 21, that Flowers had hired him for sex, and had written unguarded messages to him from a Co-op email address. One said: \"Been waiting for you to come and have some coke [cocaine] and k [ketamine] with me. P x.\" In another, when Dodd asked if he could bring his friend Lucas, Flowers responded: \"I like him a lot \u2013 but I can't afford 2 of you this time! PXx.\"</p> <p>Within 24 hours it emerged that Flowers had two previous criminal convictions:<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/20/police-search-home-former-coop-boss-paul-flowers\" title=\"\"> one for gross indecency after he was caught performing a sex act with a man in a public toilet in 1981,</a> and another for drink driving. It emerged that he had had to resign from Bradford council as recently as September 2011 when pornography, described as \"inappropriate but not illegal\", was found on his work laptop, and that he had resigned as deputy chairman of Co-op Group in June because of board concerns about his \"excessive\" use of expenses before being forced out of the chairmanship of Co-op Bank because of doubts over his competence.</p> <p>A major loser in this story has been Flowers himself. It is difficult to recall a more extraordinary personal and professional implosion. He was arrested in Liverpool and driven to a police station in Leeds for questioning in what West Yorkshire police described as an \"ongoing drug supply investigation\" before being bailed.</p> <p>And perhaps we should spare a thought for the Manchester Lads escort agency, through which Flowers met Dodd. In a statement posted on a gay and bisexual escort blog, Men of the UK, the owner of the agency lamented the breakdown in the oath of secrecy between rent boy and punter. It read: \"In the 11-year history of Manchester Lads, nothing like this has ever happened before. The majority of the escorts I list are decent people who provide complete discretion for their customers.\" Amen to that, as Reverend Flowers might say. But there have been, arguably, more significant victims, and it is here where this story will prove to have some way to go.</p> <p>On 20 November for those listening carefully, the death knell of the historic links between the Co-op group and the Labour party could be heard emanating from a private meeting in the House of Commons' Boothroyd room, overlooking the Thames.</p> <p>MPs who are members of both the Labour party and the Co-operative party, a sister organisation effectively subsumed into the bigger organisation in 1927, met to read the runes and, for those of the 32 Labour/Co-op MPs who attended, the tidings were not good. The Co-op has informed senior Labour figures of impending funding cuts of at least a third, but worse is expected. Barry Sheerman, Labour and Co-op member for Huddersfield for over three decades, reported back: \"There is no doubt that there is going to be a 30% cut across the board, it was explained to the political group.\"</p> <p>The cuts, as they are, will be highly significant for Labour, given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/04/gmb-union-labour-party-funding\" title=\"\">decision by the GMB to cut its funding to Labour MPs by 90%</a> from \u00a31.2m to \u00a3150,000 a year, and concerns that other affiliated unions will follow.</p> <p>The Co-op group donates less than the GMB to Labour MPs: \u00a3880,000 in 2012, \u00a3861,500 in 2011 and \u00a3860,000 in 2010, but the loss of up to \u00a3300,000 next year would be highly unwelcome to the MPs whose offices are run using that cash.
