      "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline chief Sir Andrew Witty has expressed regret for the \"unacceptable\" mistakes which led to a record $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) fine for mis-selling drugs in the US, and vowed that a company-wide overhaul would prevent a repeat. Witty was \"very sorry that we have had to deal with the echoes of the past\". He said: \"We're determined this is never going to happen again.\" It took Witty, who became chief executive in May 2008 and previously headed GSK's European operations, four years to deal with the legal cases in America, which involved three of its bestselling drugs. Britain's biggest pharmaceutical company sold the antidepressant Paxil for unapproved use on children and pushed Wellbutrin for sexual dysfunction and weight loss, uses for which it was not approved. In the case of Avandia, GSK failed to flag up concerns about heart risks to the regulator. The company also lavished entertainment on doctors, such as golf lessons and fishing trips, to entice them to promote its medicines. Witty said the company had changed under his leadership and had adopted a zero tolerance approach to such marketing practices. GSK has nearly doubled its compliance department since 2008 to more than 240. \"I can't promise you perfection, but we are much more aggressive in terms of disciplining and terminating employment if we find people who don't get it,\" said Witty. \"We understand this is about our licence to operate.\" The group employs 105,000 people across 150 countries. He rejected the US justice department's assertion that GSK had been illegally marketing its asthma drug Advair through \"at least 2010\" for uses not approved by the regulator, the Food and Drug Administration. He added: \"It would be naive to believe that someone takes over in mid-2008 and within a few months everything has changed. Obviously it takes time for us to make sure all of the [marketing changes] I've just discussed are in place and done.\" GSK recently agreed a \u00a31.9bn fine \u2013 which it will pay out of its \u00a37.5bn cash pile \u2013 to settle criminal and civil cases with US federal and state governments relating to actions over a 10-year period. The mis-selling and other illegal practices were brought to light by company whistleblowers. The group reiterated its line that \"where necessary, we removed employees who were engaged in misconduct\", without naming individuals. GSK's chief executive at the time, Jean-Pierre Garnier, who had his \u00a323m pay deal voted down in 2003 after a shareholder revolt, remained in the job until 2008. Witty's comments came as GSK unveiled lower first half sales and profits, and a further \u00a3500m of cost cuts by the end of 2015. This could involve job cuts, although in the UK \"it might just as well mean more jobs\", said Witty, as the group brings back previously outsourced jobs, which it has done in Montrose in Scotland. The company has been hit more than it expected by 7% price cuts imposed by European governments as part of their austerity drive, and warned pricing pressure would keep its sales flat this year. Witty called on European governments to show a greater willingness to negotiate, and warned against exporting lower prices from crisis-ridden countries to other nations. The drug giant made a second-quarter pretax profit of \u00a31.5bn, slightly down from last year and missing forecasts. While sales growth in Japan and emerging markets remained strong at 6% and 9% respectively, it has slowed from the double-digit growth seen in previous years. European sales fell 8% and the US was down 6%, leading to a 2% drop in sales overall. However, GSK is through the worst of its patent expiries and is counting on the launch of eight new medicines in the next two years, for conditions including diabetes, HIV and melanoma, the most dangerous type of skin cancer. The group has paid \u00a322bn to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks since Witty became CEO. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \"Investor patience is being rewarded via increased shareholder returns, whilst speculative hopes that the group's Consumer Health business might eventually be spun out still linger. In all, given global economic uncertainty of historic proportion, Glaxo continues to be seen as something of a safe port in a storm.\"",

      "bodyText": "Barclays was mired in fresh controversy on Wednesday night after handing almost \u00a39m to a top banker who left following the Libor scandal and after one of its highest profile non-executive directors suddenly quit, taking the toll at the top to four. Jerry del Missier, who resigned after telling subordinates to reduce the bank's Libor submission during the October 2008 banking crisis, was reported to have been handed \u00a38.75m cash as part of his leaving package. Alison Carnwath, who also chairs the property company Land Securities, cited \"personal reasons\" and time pressure for her immediate resignation from the board of Barclays, which is still reeling from the exit of chief executive Bob Diamond. The bank's chairman Marcus Agius, who is also in the process of leaving but is due to present the bank's half-year profits on Friday, will now face questions about the pay off for the Canadian-born banker Del Missier, who had just been promoted to chief operating officer. Del Missier was a close lieutenant of Diamond's and appeared before the Treasury select committee to explain why he had instructed the Libor submission to be lowered. Del Missier said Diamond had told him to cut the rate after a conversation with Paul Tucker, the Bank of England deputy governor, something both Diamond and Tucker insist was not the case. Del Missier was one of Barclays' top paid bankers. Although he did not sit on the board, where his pay would need to be published, in 2010 it emerged he had been handed \u00a340m when deals paid out. When reports of a disagreement over Del Missier's leaving bonus emerged, the bank had insisted it was keen to foster debate in the boardroom. Shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie called on del Missier to follow Diamond and waive the bulk of his payoff. \"Having resigned from Barclays over the Libor fixing scandal, people will find the scale of this award completely inappropriate. Bob Diamond rightly waived most of his pay off and Mr del Missier ought to do the same,\" Leslie said. Barclays declined to comment. There was speculation of boardroom tensions even before the Libor scandal broke, between Carnwath and Agius during negotiations over Diamond's bonus in the spring. Former investment banker Carnwath wanted Diamond to waive a \u00a32.7m bonus \u2013 part of a \u00a317m pay deal \u2013 to show leadership but she eventually agreed to the payout.

But her departure comes at a difficult period for the bank which is due to publish first-half profits of around \u00a33.7bn on Friday. The board has now handed a central role to former top accountant Sir Michael Rake, who becomes deputy chairman \u2013 although he has ruled himself out of the chairman's job despite expressing interest when Agius first quit. The ongoing turmoil at Barclays came as the US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner pinned the blame on the UK for the Libor problem.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "An across-the-board drop in construction, production and services dragged the economy deeper into double-dip recession in the second quarter and put Britain at risk of suffering its third annual decline in output in the past five years. City analysts said that without a surge in the second half of the year, there was little chance of achieving the 0.8% increase in gross domestic product pencilled in by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility at the time of the March Budget. The dismal GDP figures followed a downgrade of the UK's economic prospects from the International Monetary Fund last week, which put UK growth in 2012 at 0.2%. The economy contracted by 1.1% in 2008 and 4.4% in 2009 before recovering less than half the lost ground in the following two years. \"Although some temporary factors pulled down output, it looks like there was some underlying contraction too\", said Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics. \"Even allowing for a decent bounce-back in Q3, our forecast for a 0.5% fall in GDP in 2012 as a whole looks on track.\" Weakness in construction, which accounts for 7% of national output, contributed 0.4 percentage points of the 0.7% decline in GDP between the first and second quarters of the year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. Officials said the workload on Britain's building sites decreased by 5.2% between March and June, the biggest quarterly fall since early 2008, although the ONS warned that its \"flash estimate\" was based on incomplete data. Factors behind the contraction in construction are believed to be the end of work on the Olympics, lower government investment on public infrastructure, the continued low level of private house building and the unusually wet spring weather. Output in the second quarter of 2012 was almost 10% lower than in the same three months of 2011, but some analysts said the ONS figures were much worse than had been suggested by surveys of building firms. Joe Grice, the chief economist at the ONS said: \"It does seem to make sense particularly in construction that weather would have had an adverse impact\". In a blow to the government's hopes of rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing and exports, industrial production slipped by 1.3% between the first and second quarters, contributing 0.2 points to the overall decline in GDP. Manufacturing, which accounts for a little more than 10% of the UK's national output, posted a 1.4% drop as the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone and the squeeze on consumer incomes from inflation hit demand for goods from UK factories. Services, by far the biggest sector of the economy, also went backwards in the second quarter. Spending in hotels, restaurants and shops was depressed, according to the ONS, although the biggest decline was in the transport, storage and communication sub sector. Business services and finance posted a 0.1% quarterly rise, while the public sector increased its output by 0.3%. Overall, services were responsible for 0.1 points of the 0.7% fall in GDP. Although some analysts said the impact of the extra bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee shaved 0.5 points off growth in the second quarter, the ONS said it was hard to put a figure on the impact of the loss of a working day. Michael Saunders, UK economist at Citigroup said construction had been boosted in 2010-11 by the Olympics programme and had now suffered its second sharp decline in a row. \"It is a common pattern among Olympic host countries that GDP growth slows as construction projects wind down. Second quarter growth also probably was hit by the extra bank holiday for the Queen's Jubilee. \"But, the weakness in GDP cannot be wholly attributed to such special factors. The economy has basically flat-lined for two years and, with household deleveraging, heavy fiscal drag and weakness in key EMU export markets, we expect that the economy is likely to be roughly flat for the next 12-18 months as well.\"",

After three days of declines, Spanish shares ticked up 0.8% on the country's main index, while the Italian equivalent was 1.2% higher. Germany's DAX inched up 0.2% and the French CAC 40 rose 0.2%. Only the FTSE 100 index was in negative territory, down by just 0.02% on the day at 5498 points as the market digested worse-than-expected GDP figures. Traders were cheered by comments from Ewald Nowotny, governor of Austria's central bank and a member of the ECB's governing council. Nowotny said there were arguments for giving the eurozone's new bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a banking licence. That would allow the fund to borrow from the ECB, easing concerns that its \u20ac500bn (\u00a3390bn) pot of cash would not be enough if Spain or Italy needed a bailout. The euro bounced on the news, hitting a high of $1.22. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said: \"This is seen by many as one of the few options that remains to hold the euro area together. We have to remember what purpose this cash infusion serves; it allows [countries] to get on with the process of reform. The bigger the injection, the longer they can hold out. That's why the market got quite excited.\" But, he said, the rally was limited because it was clear Nowotny's views were not shared by his colleagues in the ECB. Earlier this month, ECB president Mario Draghi dismissed the idea of granting the ESM a banking licence. \"I don't think there's anything to gain in destroying the credibility of an institution, asking it to behave outside the limits of its mandate,\" he said. The president of Germany's central bank has also expressed reservations about the idea. Yields on Spanish government bonds \u2013 in effect their interest rate and a reflection of their risk rating \u2013 also eased. Concerns that Spain would have to seek a full bailout have escalated in recent days, after the Spanish finance minister, Luis de Guindos, met the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, on Tuesday. Reports suggested Sch\u00e4uble had urged De Guindos to request a full bailout, sending the yield on the Spanish 10-year bond to a euro-era high of 7.78% on Wednesday morning. But the yield dropped to 7.43% after the German government dismissed the claims. Asked whether Sch\u00e4uble had made such a request, a spokesman for the German finance ministry said: \"That's absurd and not up for debate.\" The prospect of Greece leaving the eurozone also retreated after a senior German politician suggested the country may need a second debt restructuring to stay in the euro. Norbert Barthle, a leading political ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told Bloomberg: \"We should try to keep Greece in the eurozone.\" If action is needed to do so, \"not just taxpayers but also private creditors would again be involved in helping Greece, but under strict conditionality,\" he said. The more buoyant mood among investors was tempered by appalling UK GDP figures and a survey in Germany that showed business morale falling in Europe's largest economy. The Ifo thinktank said German business sentiment dropped for the third month in a row in July, to its lowest level in more than two years. Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING bank, said: \"It looks as if German businesses have finally woken up to reality. Today's Ifo index sends a clear warning that even the most solid ship can capsize in a rough thunderstorm.\" Meanwhile, policymakers continued to push for the implementation of measures decided at the last eurozone summit. On Wednesday De Guindos held a meeting with the French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, to discuss the creation of a single body to supervise eurozone banks. In a joint statement, the pair stressed the urgency of putting this in place by the end of the year. \"Our common strategy for the stability of the euro area includes the adoption, by the end of this year, of a single supervisory mechanism for banks of the euro area, involving the ECB. We expect proposals by the commission by September and commit to a swift negotiation.\" They said the creation of the supervisory body would open the way to channelling bailout funds directly to banks, but said the aid would still come with conditions. Spain's inverted curves In baseball jargon, curve balls can leave you flat on your behind. Spain's debt crisis appeared to be heading for the economic equivalent yesterday. The yield curve on Spanish bonds threatened to invert, displaying a classic sign that a national economy is heading towards the rocks. A fresh bout of early morning jitters in the City saw the yield, or interest rate, on Spain's two- and five-year bonds jump to new record highs. Yields are a useful proxy for the riskiness of a bond and, therefore, the creditworthiness of a country's economy. At one stage yesterday Spain's five-year bonds were yielding 7.45%, more than the 10-year bond. And this is curve ball territory, where the usual dynamic of short-term debt being safer than long-term debt is switched around, or inverted. City analysts warned that the Spanish yield curve, which normally rises as bond maturities lengthen, was \"flattening\" as the yield on typically less risky debt rose. Two-year bond yields briefly spiked as high as 7.18%. \"Demanding such high interest rates of investors, for even short-term debt, shows us their angst,\" explained Louise Cooper of BGC Partners. And it looks increasingly likely that only the European Central Bank can hit this crisis out of the park. Graeme Wearden",

    "webTitle": "MPs tell Barclays to stop fundraising for Mitt Romney", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barclays has privately distanced itself from its bankers' donations to Mitt Romney, the US Republican presidential candidate, after its executives were accused in parliament of fundraising for political candidates instead of working to rebuild the public's trust in the wake of the Libor-setting scandal. Executives at Barclays have donated over $1m to Romney's presidential campaign and will hand over more money on Thursday night at an exclusive fundraising dinner in a secret Mayfair location, where tickets cost between $50,000 and $75,000. Romney arrived in the UK on Wednesday for a series of meetings with David Cameron and other political figures before attending two fundraising events and the Olympics this weekend. An early-day motion (EDM) signed by 11 MPs last week demanded the bank and its directors stop working to bolster Romney's election campaign war chest and concentrate on repairing confidence and trust in the banking system instead. But in a letter to the signatories of the motion, Cyrus Ardalan, a vice-chairman of Barclays and head of the UK and European government relations, said the bank was not a supporter of the presidential hopeful. \"I ... would like to clarify that all political activity undertaken by Barclays' US employees, including personal fundraising for specific candidates, is done so in a personal capacity, and not on behalf of Barclays,\" he wrote. \"Barclays is politically non-partisan, makes no political donations nor seeks to influence the political activities of its employees.\" The EDM, whose primary sponsor was Grahame Morris MP, criticised the fact that the recently departed Barclays chief executive, Bob Diamond, and other existing senior Barclays executives have played a prominent role in fundraising efforts for the Romney campaign. The dinner was due to be co-hosted by Diamond but he pulled out after resigning as chief executive in the wake of the Libor rate-fixing scandal. Diamond has been replaced by Patrick Durkin, the managing director of Barclays Capital, the bank's \"casino banking\" investment arm. Diamond, along with Cameron, was a very public supporter of John McCain, the last Republican candidate for the presidency, when he ran against Barack Obama in 2008. Romney earned a $50,000 speaking fee from Barclays in 2011. MPs including Jim Cunningham, Mark Durkan, Margaret Richie and John McDonnell raised concerns that at least 15 of Barclays Capital's most senior bankers based in the US have donated the maximum allowable individual donation per election to the Romney campaign. They also criticised the fact that Durkin has already reportedly raised over $1m for the Romney campaign. Other hosts of the event, which is being held at a secret location understood to be a five-star hotel in central London, include Dwight Poler, the managing director of the European arm of Bain Capital, the private equity house founded by Romney, and Eric Varvel, the chief executive of Credit Suisse's investment banking arm. Among 47 named co-hosts are Raj Bhattacharyya, a managing director at Deutsche Bank, Karl Peterson, the European boss of private equity firm TPG Capital. Also present will be Woody Johnson, the owner of American football team the New York Jets and a great-grandson of the founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Guests who can't quite stretch to the $50,000-$75,000 required for dinner with Romney are invited to a 5pm reception, which costs from $2,500 a head. On Friday Romney will also attend the London 2012 opening ceremony. The pro-Barack Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action will use his visit to the Olympics to release a new advert attacking Romney's record outsourcing jobs and moving millions of dollars of his wealth to offshore tax havens. \"We know the Swiss have a special place in Mitt Romney's wallet, er, heart,\" the voiceover of the advert says as the Swiss athletes march into the games with Romney shown waving. \"He kept millions in Swiss banks. Those Swiss sure know how to keep a secret.\" The advert ends with the line: \"You gotta say this about Mitt Romney. He sure knows how to go for the gold \u2013 for himself.\" While in London, Romney will also meet Cameron, Nick Clegg, George Osborne and Ed Miliband. It is the second time Romney has visited London to raise cash following a meeting with \"a few friends\" in Mayfair last summer. London's role in global finance has made it a key fundraising target in presidential elections. Obama, who is trailing Romney in the race for cash, held a similar fundraising party in the capital before the 2008 election. Romney's event is being organised by Scott Preen, a London company that specialises in high-profile political fundraising parties. The company, run by Frances Penn, has previously organised lavish events for Romney and McCain, who ran against Obama in the 2008 election. Scott Preen, whose clients include Bulgari, Dior and the National Bank of Greece, has previously held receptions at Spencer House, the 18th-century mansion owned by Lord Rothschild. The company declined to comment.",

Also present will be Woody Johnson, the owner of American football team the New York Jets and a great-grandson of the founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p> <p>Guests who can't quite stretch to the $50,000-$75,000 required for dinner with Romney are invited to a 5pm reception, which costs from $2,500 a head.</p> <p>On Friday Romney will also attend the London 2012 opening ceremony.</p> <p>The pro-Barack Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action will use his visit to the Olympics to release a new advert attacking Romney's record outsourcing jobs and moving millions of dollars of his wealth to offshore tax havens.</p> <p>\"We know the Swiss have a special place in Mitt Romney's wallet, er, heart,\" the voiceover of the advert says as the Swiss athletes march into the games with Romney shown waving. \"He kept millions in Swiss banks. Those Swiss sure know how to keep a secret.\"</p> <p>The advert ends with the line: \"You gotta say this about Mitt Romney. He sure knows how to go for the gold \u2013 for himself.\"</p> <p>While in London, Romney will also meet Cameron, Nick Clegg, George Osborne and Ed Miliband. It is the second time Romney has visited London to raise cash following a meeting with \"a few friends\" in Mayfair last summer.</p> <p>London's role in global finance has made it a key fundraising target in presidential elections. Obama, who is trailing Romney in the race for cash, held a similar fundraising party in the capital before the 2008 election.</p> <p>Romney's event is being organised by Scott Preen, a London company that specialises in high-profile political fundraising parties. The company, run by Frances Penn, has previously organised lavish events for Romney and McCain, who ran against Obama in the 2008 election.</p> <p>Scott Preen, whose clients include Bulgari, Dior and the National Bank of Greece, has previously held receptions at Spencer House, the 18th-century mansion owned by Lord Rothschild. The company declined to comment.</p>",

The Luton-based budget airline said \"strong demand\" for beach holidays due to poor weather in northern Europe had underpinned the double-digit increase. EasyJet said the top three beach destinations were in Spain and Portugal, with holidaymakers flocking to Malaga, Alicante and Faro, including booking surges on particularly wet days. EasyJet said passenger numbers increased by 10.9% to 16 million in the three months to the end of June, with the load factor - or amount of seats sold per flight - rising by nearly three percentage points to 89%, helping push up revenues by 10.5% to \u00a31.03bn. Ancillary fees, which include baggage charges, rose by \u00a31.20 to \u00a311.81 per seat. Buoyed by the demand outlook and a drop in fuel prices, easyJet said it expected full-year pre-tax profits to come in between \u00a3280m and \u00a3300m, compared with market forecasts of \u00a3272m. While UK nationals are heading for Mediterranean shores, easyJet said there was evidence that the rest of the continent is avoiding London during the Olympics. The carrier said: \"EasyJet has seen a fall in demand for flights touching London during the Olympic period, both from inbound business travellers and outbound leisure travellers, but forward bookings show a recovery once the games have concluded.\" Douglas McNeill, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said a strong summer performance is important as the airline industry heads into the traditionally quieter autumn and winter period. \"The weather has done EasyJet a favour this summer, with rain-lashed Brits flocking to the Med in search of sunshine.

However, those collapses are a business opportunity for Ryanair and easyJet, opening up potential routes for their expanding fleets.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Chip designer reports forecast beating figures after strong demand and record order backlog", 
      "body": "<p>After Apple's disappointing figures, investors holding shares in one of its suppliers, <strong>Arm</strong>, must have been fearing the worst.</p> <p>But the Cambridge-based chip designer shook off any malaise in the tech industry to report a forecast beating 23% rise in second quarter profits. Demand for its products, used in smartphones as well as the iPad, outstripped the industry, since Intel and Qualcomm as well as Apple have recently issued downbeat statements.</p> <p>Apple was hit by the downturn in Europe and consumers holding back purchases until the new version of the iPhone. But Arm benefited from widening its customer base and strong licensing fees. With the caution from its customers, the outlook is less certain but said it had a record order backlog. Julian Yates at Investec issued a buy note with an 800p target, saying:</p> <blockquote> We continue to see Arm as a standout tech sector holding. The strong licence growth of recent years, which has continued into the first half we see catalysing royalty upgrades from 2013 which in our view supports 2016 earnings per share of more than 45p, which drives our target price. We acknowledge the near term negative stockmarket trends, but see material long term value in Arm. <br> </blockquote> <p>Canaccord Genuity was more cautious, with a hold recommendation but Arm's shares added 41.7p to 526.5p, a near 9% rise which made it the biggest riser in the leading index.</p> <p>Overall, despite a shock 0.7% fall in UK GDP, continuing worries about the eurozone and an 8.4% drop in US new home sales in June to 350,000, markets held up remarkably well. The <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>finished virtually flat, down just 0.91 points at 5498.32. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> With the eurozone near total collapse it is a complete wonder that the market has not sold off any more that it has in recent days but as the data gets poorer by the day, the expectations grow even greater that central banks are set to pump more stimulus into the economy very soon. <br> </blockquote> <p>Earlier Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank had commented on the prospects for next week's meetings of the US Federal Reserve, Bank of England and European Central Bank:</p> <blockquote> It seems likely that markets will start to price in some probability of both the Federal Reserve and the ECB acting next week but we still think that the Fed may wait until September and that the ECB may wait for governments to make more progress before they step in. However current stresses make this a close call. If nothing does come out of next week's meetings the market could be in for a pretty bad August. </blockquote> <p>Close behind Arm in the rankings came <strong>Capita</strong>. The outsourcing group climbed 36p to 713.5p after announcing half year profits of \u00a3190.7m, up 10%. Despite the much-publicised travails of G4S, Capita said:</p> <blockquote> The market for outsourcing remains buoyant, particularly across the UK public sector where we are seeing a high level of sales activity. <br> </blockquote> <p>It said it had won a record \u00a31.3bn of work during the first six months of 2012, including a contract to run recruitment for the British Army.</p> <p>The profit figures were also boosted by a number of deals.

      "bodyText": "After Apple's disappointing figures, investors holding shares in one of its suppliers, Arm, must have been fearing the worst. But the Cambridge-based chip designer shook off any malaise in the tech industry to report a forecast beating 23% rise in second quarter profits. Demand for its products, used in smartphones as well as the iPad, outstripped the industry, since Intel and Qualcomm as well as Apple have recently issued downbeat statements. Apple was hit by the downturn in Europe and consumers holding back purchases until the new version of the iPhone. But Arm benefited from widening its customer base and strong licensing fees. With the caution from its customers, the outlook is less certain but said it had a record order backlog. Julian Yates at Investec issued a buy note with an 800p target, saying: We continue to see Arm as a standout tech sector holding. The strong licence growth of recent years, which has continued into the first half we see catalysing royalty upgrades from 2013 which in our view supports 2016 earnings per share of more than 45p, which drives our target price. We acknowledge the near term negative stockmarket trends, but see material long term value in Arm. Canaccord Genuity was more cautious, with a hold recommendation but Arm's shares added 41.7p to 526.5p, a near 9% rise which made it the biggest riser in the leading index. Overall, despite a shock 0.7% fall in UK GDP, continuing worries about the eurozone and an 8.4% drop in US new home sales in June to 350,000, markets held up remarkably well. The FTSE 100 finished virtually flat, down just 0.91 points at 5498.32. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: With the eurozone near total collapse it is a complete wonder that the market has not sold off any more that it has in recent days but as the data gets poorer by the day, the expectations grow even greater that central banks are set to pump more stimulus into the economy very soon. Earlier Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank had commented on the prospects for next week's meetings of the US Federal Reserve, Bank of England and European Central Bank: It seems likely that markets will start to price in some probability of both the Federal Reserve and the ECB acting next week but we still think that the Fed may wait until September and that the ECB may wait for governments to make more progress before they step in. However current stresses make this a close call. If nothing does come out of next week's meetings the market could be in for a pretty bad August. Close behind Arm in the rankings came Capita. The outsourcing group climbed 36p to 713.5p after announcing half year profits of \u00a3190.7m, up 10%. Despite the much-publicised travails of G4S, Capita said: The market for outsourcing remains buoyant, particularly across the UK public sector where we are seeing a high level of sales activity. It said it had won a record \u00a31.3bn of work during the first six months of 2012, including a contract to run recruitment for the British Army. The profit figures were also boosted by a number of deals. Capita has spent \u00a3771m since January 2010, and it still on the acquisition trail. It raised \u00a3271m in April to fund further purchases, and it expects to spend another \u00a370m to \u00a3120m during the rest of the year. But on a busy day for company news, Tullow Oil slid more than 6% on disappointment there was no fresh drilling news in its latest profit statement. The company reported a 48% jump in half year profits to $829m but this included a $701m gain on the sale of a 66% stake in the Lake Albert project in Uganda to Total and China's CNOOC, offset by $451m of write-offs related to exploration costs. It also said the Ugandan government now has to approve the development plans, so production would not begin for three years after this. Tullow closed 86p lower at \u00a312.84. GlaxoSmithKline lost 19p to 1426.5p as its second quarter revenues and earnings missed forecasts, and it warned sales in 2012 would be flat compared to last year. The news helped push rivals AstraZeneca - which reports on Thursday - 23p lower to \u00a329.09 and Shire down 13p to \u00a318.77. BT lost 7.2p to 210.2p after a 6% fall in first quarter revenues, hit by the eurozone crisis and a slowdown in its corporate business. Johnson Matthey dropped 35p to \u00a320.81 following flat first quarter profits, hit by falling platinum prices. Elsewhere SSE closed down 70p at \u00a312.94 as the power group's shares went ex-dividend while Drax dropped76.5p to 442p. The fall came after the government announced reduced support from generating electricity from biomass, which was supposed to be the catalyst to turn Drax from a coal-fired plant into a green energy supplier. At that point many analysts believed it could be a target for the likes of Centrica. Responding to the government's announcements, the company said it had already spent \u00a320m more than expected on researching the change, and said it was refining its previously announced \u00a3650m to \u00a3700m capital investment plan: We believe that within approximately five years Drax could become a predominantly biomass fuelled plant.

But why did she choose Barclays for the chop? It's understandable she would want to retain the chairmanship of Land Securities, a FTSE 100 company. But why not cut her non-executive posting at Man Group? Or why not shed the role at the private equity firm Isis, where she chairs the management committee? Or even her boardroom position at Paccar, the US-based maker of heavy-duty trucks, or Zurich Insurance? It's not as if a Barclays' directorship could ever have been considered a breeze. Even in August 2010, when Carnwath joined, the bank was never out of the headlines. She increased her commitment last October, by agreeing to chair the remuneration committee. Could it be she is a zealous would-be reformer on pay and feels her best efforts are being thwarted? It is known that she wanted Bob Diamond to be denied a bonus last year. She might also find Jerry del Missier's potential \u00a38.75m pay-off objectionable. But if that's the tale, then the time to resign was February, when bonus matters were being settled by the board. At the annual meeting in April she gave a robust defence of Barclays' pay policies, including Diamond's \u00a32.7m bonus. For her troubles, she got a 21% vote against her re-election. That might have been enough to trigger departure. But Carnwath didn't refer to it in her statement. The survivors among Barclays' non-executive directors are entitled to feel miffed.

Photograph: Robert Yager for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The impact of the immense pressure on Walmart suppliers can easily be seen at what workers call simply \"the Crossdock\". Workers say they are given brutal quotas for the number of boxes that they need to shift each hour. Supervisors, they say, make it clear that any failure to meet those quotas \u2013 even at the risk of physical injury \u2013 could be the loss of a job. \"I feel that I am just something they could use and throw away,\" said Limber Herrera, 29, pictured, who is supporting a wife and two children on his wage.</p> <p>Few of those working the Crossdock can afford to lose the work: even when it comes at the price it does. Take Reuben Valdez. He is 61, and lives in a cheap motel with his partner and her mother, who suffers from dementia. He lost his home after supervisors reduced his hours, causing him to miss rent payments. He is desperate, recently pawning jewellery to pay for three more nights at an Econo Lodge.</p> <p>Despite his age, Valdez says he is expected to meet quotas of up to 250 boxes an hour. \"It is an impossibility. But they tell you to work harder. They shout at you and harass you. They say: 'If you can't take it, then you know where the door is,'\" he said.</p> <p><strong>'I am so annoyed and aggravated'</strong></p> <p>There would be no shortage of people to replace him. Over the last 10 years the warehouse industry has boomed in the Inland Empire. This stretch of hot and dry desert valley, about an hour's drive from Los Angeles, is now the biggest such hub in America. It is thought that about 110,000 low-wage warehouse workers are now employed in the Inland Empire, with the vast majority of them being Hispanics, and around half being immigrants.</p> <p>One recent survey by the WWU and the University of California interviewed 101 workers and found that 83 of them said they had suffered a job-related illness. It also found that almost half of workers claimed to have been exposed to chemicals at work. All told the Inland Empire's warehouse workers represent one of the most vulnerable work forces in America: low paid, afraid to speak out, and with virtually no political power.</p> <p>Some workers complain of the mental stress caused by these conditions. \"There are times that I can't go straight home because I am so annoyed and aggravated. I just have to stay outside,\" said Carlos Martinez, 27, pictured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-393610235\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/7/24/1343160183462/Walmart-007.jpg\" alt=\"Walmart\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carlos Martinez at Warehouse Workers United in Ontario, CA. Photograph: Robert Yager</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Others blame the pressure for causing injuries, which they say supervisors see as an inconvenience and a threat to slowing the processing of goods. They describe a system run by fear. When Rojas was injured on the job, he says, he was told to finish his quota before seeking medical help. He then had to walk two miles to a clinic, but found it shut by the time he arrived. He returned to work and only then was sent to a 24-hour clinic where he was diagnosed with a sprained back, neck and shoulder.</p> <p>The NFI Crossdock is hardly alone, however. Other warehouses serving the Walmart supply chain in the Inland Empire have also had problems. At a warehouse run by a subcontracted firm called Schneider \u2013 barely a mile away from NFI Crossdock \u2013 a class action lawsuit has alleged that Schneider and two staffing agencies it contracted to supply workers falsified pay records in a way that kept their wages even lower. Workers there also complained of poor safety standards, a climate of fear and being pressurised to work so hard that injuries resulted.</p> <p>One worker at a Schneider plant \u2013 which, like the NFI Crossdock supplied only Walmart \u2013 described to NELP how he worked 362 days in a year, for 16 hours a day, with no overtime and no lunch breaks.</p> <p>Schneider has denied the allegations, saying it complies with labour regulations.</p> <p>In this supply chain, retaliation for speaking out or complaining is common, workers say. At NFI Crossdock, Rojas described coming back to work after his injury and being given a broom and a chair and told to sit in the middle of the warehouse floor. \"I felt like they did it to embarrass and humiliate me. In eight years I have never seen anyone do that,\" Rojas said.</p> <p><strong>'I can't tie my shoelace without it hurting'</strong></p> <p>At Schneider, Marcos Lopez, 19, who is part of the class action claim, suffered a back injury working as a lumper. But, as he reported it more than an hour after feeling the first spasms of pain, he was put on a \"performance improvement plan\" for late reporting an injury. Shortly afterwards he lost his company ID badge. He was charged $5 to replace it, and fired for losing company property. \"I don't have health insurance, and my back is still messed up. I can't tie my shoelace without it hurting,\" Lopez said told the Guardian.</p> <p>Walmart says the labour conditions are the responsibility of its contractors. Indeed, the contractors themselves also then often subcontract, especially with staffing agencies who often supply most of the labour for the manual jobs.</p> <p>Critics say such an argument is disingenuous. \"Walmart uses these companies as a buffer to negate any responsibility for what happens in their workplaces,\" said Professor Juan de Lara, an expert at the University of Southern California.</p> <p>In fact, critics say, Walmart's business strategy is based on inflicting relentless cost-cutting on suppliers. The giant firm builds its supply chain with a \"plus one\" bargaining strategy, which requires all suppliers and contractors to reduce their price or increase their speed each and every year they work with Walmart.</p> <p>Walmart also has staff inside the warehouses of the Inland Empire. At NFI Crossdock, there is a Walmart employee on site. Court documents filed as a result of the Schneider suit showed Walmart set productivity standards and - if warehouse worker productivity declined \u2013 cut compensation to Schneider.</p> <p>But there are signs that Walmart is recognising a problem. When it came to the specific points of the complaints of NFI workers, Walmart spokesman Dan Fogleman said: \"It's concerning to hear these types of claims about someone we do business with and, while these are just allegations at this point, we recognize there is an opportunity to step up and help shape the working environment that exists in some of these facilities.</p> <p>\"We hold all of our service providers and their subcontractors to the highest standards, and expect and require them to comply with the law and, if violations occur, to take corrective action immediately.\"</p> <p>Fogleman said the firm was looking to make improvements. \"We are looking at a number of ways we can better work with our service providers to help them develop processes to prevent and detect potential issues and help ensure the people working for them are treated appropriately,\" he added.</p> <p>That might be a glimmer of hope for labour activists. \"The same way Walmart drives down standards, they can also make this a better industry,\" said Guadalupe Palma, a campaign director with WWU. De Lara argued that the warehouse industry could actually form part of a US economic recovery if wages were higher. \"They don't have to be bad jobs. They can support a decent middle-class lifestyle,\" he said.</p> <p>However, there is still a long way to go. Recently, in response to the WWU efforts in the warehouses, supervisors at NFI Crossdock handed many workers a flyer with their wages. The leaflet, a copy of which was obtained by the Guardian, warned against supporting the formation of a union. \"Don't sign away your rights,\" it claimed.</p> <p>One recipient of the flyer was Miguel Gonzalez. He was told to make sure he read it by a woman manager, but warned against doing so on company time when he should be lifting boxes. \"She said I needed to read it on my break,\" Gonzalez said.</p>",

The competition appeals tribunal dismissed its claims again but the operator was given leave to take its case to the court of appeal. The judgment from that court is expected on Thursday. Matthews said: \"If someone told you you needed to sell your house by a fixed date you'd be anxious. It's unwelcome for us. We'll see the outcome of the appeal tomorrow. But in any event the fact of a deadline is uncomfortable for us.\" Meanwhile, passenger growth continued at Heathrow to record levels, up 2.2% in the first six months of 2012 \u2013 despite the airport being at its limit for flight numbers \u2013 thanks to fuller and bigger planes. The Airport Service Quality scores for passenger satisfaction at the airport had risen solidly again, turning the airport around since 2007 in relation to rival hubs, Matthews said. An 8.4% rise in revenue was helping to fund a capital investment of \u00a3100m a day. Matthews claimed that there was no bigger current private sector investment in infrastructure at the moment. Pre-tax losses dropped to \u00a350.9m, down from \u00a3249.2m a year ago, reflecting gains on valuations of derivatives. Thursday will be a crucial day for BAA, with the biggest ever daily influx of visitors at Heathrow expected and the outcome of the Stansted decision.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Financial market fears over a possible Greek exit from the single currency were fanned on Tuesday by a gloomy assessment of the country's economic plight from international debt inspectors and evidence of a growing rift between Athens and Berlin. Officials from the so-called troika \u2013 the IMF, the European Union and the European Central Bank \u2013 warned that Greece had failed to keep to the deficit reduction plan agreed earlier this year. Arriving in Athens for talks with the coalition government, one official was quoted as saying: \"Greece is hugely off track. The debt-sustainability analysis will be pretty terrible.\" Another official pointed to the latest growth estimates from Athens, which show the economy contracting by 7% this year rather than the 5% previously forecast, meaning that the debt burden is only increasing in relation to GDP. \"Nothing has been done in Greece for the past three or four months,\" said the official, referring to the delays caused by the two elections held since May. German politicians have been ratcheting up the pressure on the new government of Antonis Samaras in recent days, stressing that Greece can expect its financial lifeline to be cut off unless it agrees to a fresh round of deeply unpopular austerity measures. Samaras reacted angrily to suggestions from Germany that Greece is incapable of meeting its bailout pledges and should start planning for the return of the drachma, branding the comments irresponsible. \"I say it openly and publicly, they undermine our national effort,\" the prime minister said in a speech to party members. \"We do all we can to bring the country back on its feet and they do all they can so we can fail,\" he said. The deteriorating situation in Greece coincided with another turbulent day on Europe's financial markets. Spain saw the interest rate on its 10-year debt climb to a record post-peseta level of 7.65% and shares closed at their lowest level for almost a decade, amid mounting speculation that the eurozone's fourth biggest economy will require a bailout of at least \u20ac300bn (\u00a3233bn). Concerns that financial help for Spain would leave Europe with insufficient funds to support Italy meant the Rome stock market fell to levels not seen since the creation of monetary union. Shares in London and New York were under pressure. On Tuesday night, Moody's changed the outlook on the provisional (P)Aaa long-term rating of the European Financial Stability Facility to negative from stable, a blow to a fund that was supposed to backstop struggling EU members. Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, admitted that he was \"very concerned\" about the eurozone crisis, which has been escalating amid fears that Spain may need a bailout. \"The eurozone cannot hang around,\" he said. Turner said the new banking bailout facility needs to be able to directly recapitalise banks and cut the \"fatal\" tie between sovereigns and banks. \"The eurozone will not be a stable system without rapid progress towards a banking union,\" Turner said. Deutsche Bank was forced to issue an unscheduled trading update \u2013 before figures officially scheduled for next Tuesday \u2013 warning that that its profits were lower than forecast as a result of the crisis that was affecting its cost base, which is rising because it is largely denominated in dollars and sterling. Trouble at Spain's 17 regional governments continued to snowball as eastern Catalonia admitted it had few funding options left to it and may well have to ask for bailout money from central government. \"Catalonia has no other bank than the government of Spain,\" regional finance chief Andreu Mas-Colell told the BBC. Officials insisted he was not saying Catalonia needed money immediately from the government's new \u20ac18bn liquidity fund, but Mas-Colell admitted that if the powerful region is to roll over its debt and fund its deficit, then it must raise money from somewhere. Officials in the Catalan capital of Barcelona said they were still working with some banks and that a new issue of patriotic bonds, which have already mopped up some 10% of local savings, was still a possibility. But the Catalan government has long been calling for central government to come up with a mechanism to help cover regional debt refinancing. Mariano Rajoy's Spanish government has now set up a liquidity fund, but has made it clear money will come with conditions. \"The budget conditions imply presenting an adjustment programme \u2026 and, if payments are not met, intervention,\" the budget minister Cristobal Montoro has explained, referring to direct government control of the region's finances. He welcomed the news that Catalonia had joined Valencia and Murcia in indicating it may need money from the fund. \"It is good to tell the truth,\" he said. Former senior government and central bank officials, meanwhile, were grilled by a parliamentary committee looking into why Spain has needed a bank bailout of up to 100bn euros. Former Bank of Spain governor Miguel Angel Fern\u00e1ndez Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez \u2013 pushed out of his job by the government last month - placed part of the blame on finance minister Luis de Guindos, saying he made the crisis at bailed-out Bankia crisis worse by forcing the dismissal of chairman Rodrigo Rato.",
