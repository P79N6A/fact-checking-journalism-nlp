      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s fund management industry is \u201cripe for investigation\u201d because of \u201can alarming lack of transparency that surrounds [its] pay and practices\u201d, the influential Institute of Directors said on Sunday. Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, said \u201cuninterested\u201d financial regulators should wake up \u201cto avoid another scandal of epic proportions.\u201d Writing on the Guardian\u2019s website, Walker said there are reasons to be proud of the fund management industry in the UK but argued that more clarity is required about how it operates \u201cand most pertinent of all, how salaries are earned.\u201d Without such openness, he said, fund managers risk losing public trust and making themselves \u201cthe new investment bankers.\u201d He cited last week\u2019s \u00a318m fine for Aviva Investors, the fund management division of giant insurer Aviva, as one cause for concern. Traders were found to have manipulated deals to boost their fees at the expense of customers. Walker also pointed to Standard Life\u2019s \u00a35m pay packages for David Nish, the chief executive, and Keith Skeoch, its head of the investment division. \u201cIf fund manager earnings continue to rise in line with assets, with little or no transparency about how they operate, then their reputations as prudent custodians of other people\u2019s money could start to unravel,\u201d said the IoD boss. Walker quoted research by European thinktank New Financial showing pay at asset management firms is taking a constant portion of a \u201cgrowing pot.\u201d By contrast, he said, investment bankers are receiving a smaller helping of a shrinking pot. He said: \u201cThis has all the ingredients of another scandal, where public attention turns slowly to a shady quarter of our financial landscape, and doesn\u2019t like what it sees. Until we really understand the mechanisms of this industry the risk remains that fund managers will become the new investment bankers.\u201d The IoD, which has 38,000 members ranging from bosses of multinationals to entrepreneurs running start-ups, will on Monday launch a paper setting out its recommendations on corporate governance, a key focus for its work. One proposal is to encourage the government to work with regulators \u2013 primarily the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) \u2013 to review the fund management industry with the aim of creating \u201ca more transparent and governance-oriented share ownership system.\u201d The IoD backs the Labour party\u2019s call for fund managers to be forced to declare how they vote on pay and other resolutions at companies\u2019 annual meeting. Walker argued that fund managers have been protected from scrutiny by concentration on bankers\u2019 bonuses. \u201cIt is important for the entire UK business community that fund managers are effective overseers of good governance, rather than mere absentee landlords. Unless that happens, policy makers will inevitably lose faith in the ability of shareholders to act as custodians of public companies. \u201cThey will be drawn to the temptation of legislating and regulating to shape directly corporate governance arrangements in the UK. If the fund management industry doesn\u2019t take steps to address growing public concern about their practices and oversight, then an FCA-driven approach may be the only way forward.\u201d The IoD has been vocal in recent years in naming companies where it perceives failings in governance and pay policies. Targets have included Sports Direct, Burberry, Experian and Essar Energy. It also opposed a proposed \u00a325m pay deal for Helge Lund, BG Group\u2019s new chief executive, describing it as \u201cexcessive, inflammatory and a red rag to the enemies of the free market.\u201d BG later reduced the size of Lund\u2019s award. Walker has argued previously for shareholders to be more active in holding boards to account, but his demand for greater regulatory scrutiny of the fund management industry itself is new. Standard Life said 2014 had been a \u201cpivotal year\u201d following the disposal and acquisition of businesses. \u201cThe awards made to executive directors reflect this strong performance and the value generated for shareholders,\u201d Standard Life said. The share price has risen from 233p when the share awards were made in 2012 to 400p by the time they paid out to the executives. \u201cIn order to confirm that the approach was fair and appropriate, the Remuneration Committee undertook a detailed review and an extensive consultation process with major institutional shareholders,\u201d Standard Life said.",

He kept in touch with Qatar for several years and Qatari interests later provided financial support for his participation in a Coroin rights issue in 2012. Without that support, the Barclays would have gained outright control of the company. <br></p> <p>The Coroin hotels are popular with some of the wealthiest of the Middle-Eastern super-rich.

The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) is understood to have written to the board of Coroin, the company behind the hotels, signalling its takeover ambitions. The prized hotels are currently controlled by the Barclay brothers, owners of the Telegraph newspapers, after their clever \u2014 but controversial \u2014 corporate raid on the business four years ago. Meanwhile, long-standing minority shareholder Paddy McKillen, who has 37% of Coroin shares, has also recently indicated he wants to buy out others shareholders and own the business in its entirety. While the Barclays control almost two-thirds of Coroin voting rights, McKillen believes complex legal agreements between the shareholders effectively weaken the brothers\u2019 hand when it comes to considering a takeover approach.

The brothers hold the voting rights over Quinlan\u2019s shares, and have an agreement to buy his stake, but they cannot execute that agreement without McKillen first having the opportunity to buy a little over 50% of Quinlan shares, under the terms of a shareholder agreement. That would leave McKillen with a controlling holding. The latest approach from ADIA, revealed in the Sunday Times, is not the first time Abu Dhabi interests have circled Coroin. In 2011, the Barclays are known to have discussed launching a joint takeover of the business with representatives of Sheikh Mansour, owner of Manchester City football club. Meanwhile, as long ago as 2010 McKillen had been exploring a possible sale of the business with those representing the Al-Thani ruling family of Qatar. He kept in touch with Qatar for several years and Qatari interests later provided financial support for his participation in a Coroin rights issue in 2012. Without that support, the Barclays would have gained outright control of the company. The Coroin hotels are popular with some of the wealthiest of the Middle-Eastern super-rich. Until 2004 the group had also included the Savoy hotel on the Strand but that property was sold to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Like John Major\u2019s early 1990s government, the Bank of England gives \u201cthe impression of being in office, but not in power\u201d. Former chancellor Norman Lamont\u2019s analysis could just as easily be applied to Threadneedle Street today. Six years on from the financial crisis, governor Mark Carney and his colleagues are keen to give the impression that they can control events. Sadly, their big bazooka, the threat of an interest rate rise, is as powerful as a pop-gun. Kristin Forbes, one of the Bank\u2019s latest recruits to policymaking warned in a speech last week that interest rates must rise \u201cin timely fashion\u201d. Her optimism was echoed by her colleague David Miles who went a step further when he told an all-party group of MPs a day later that Threadneedle Street was still an institution that could influence the course of economic events. He went so far as to reference a speech he gave in January entitled \u201cWhat can monetary policy do\u201d, where he expressed his confidence in their ability to steer inflation, and by implication the economy. After all, interest rates were cut to 0.5% six years ago this week. What goes down can come up again. The question must be: who are they kidding? Interest rates are going nowhere. Unfortunately, Britain\u2019s central bank is a busted flush and the only reason the monetary policy committee (MPC) still holds some sway is the result of successful marketing, which maintains in the public\u2019s mind that it may some day raise interest rates. Government ministers perpetuate this misleading impression, happy for a separate, and supposedly independent agency of the state to take the heat off them. Looking back it is easy to see the marketing operation in action. The Bank\u2019s MPC used its spin machine last year very successfully to cool an almost hysterical return of property buying that looked like it might run out of control. After a few misfires, when oblique references to the potential for rising rates were ignored by the public, governor Mark Carney declared that City forecasts were underestimating how close a rate rise might be. Almost instantly, City economists scrapped their previous efforts and switched to early November 2014 as the first shift from the current 0.5%. Consumers, shocked that a rise (first predicted by Carney for 2016) could come so soon, clamped down on spending. The economy slowed. Then Carney appeared to ease up on the threat and spending returned. Britons had a fantastic Christmas (on average), and City predictions are for a better than expected 2015. But while there are good arguments for a higher cost of borrowing and a return to what was once the normality of 4%-5% base rates (not least giving the bank another policy tool in the event of another crash), what have we seen to make us think it will happen any time soon? Look at the Bank\u2019s remit. Carney and his team are supposed to deliver a stable 2% rate of inflation. On this it has failed again and again over the last five years. There are ready explanations. In the first period of recovery after the crash, rampant oil and food prices drove up average inflation and the Bank \u201clooked through\u201d the blip, citing underlying weakness in the prices of other basic goods and services. Then the euro crisis struck sending business and consumer confidence into a nosedive. Now it is \u201clooking through\u201d ultra-low inflation, driven by a fall in food and oil prices. Miles was asked by MPs why he bothers to target inflation when it bounces round uncontrollably like a child in a ball pit. That\u2019s when he harked back to his speech and how the ability to raise interest rates still gives central banks some firepower. MPs on the treasury select committee had other things on their mind and skipped asking him what he meant. What he might have said was that the bank will look through another spike in food and oil prices unless the pressure comes from rising wages, which is a sure sign that demand pressures are bidding up costs. Tangible, domestic demand pressures are the bank\u2019s cue for action, not the volatile international commodity markets. For some time MPC members have debated the various influences on wage levels and whether pay rises will take off. Official figures have shown that until late last year, with inflation above target and average wage rises consistently below 2%, real wages suffered. The recent fall in inflation means real wages are rising. For public sector workers the next few years may look as grim as the last five. Private sector workers, on the other hand, many of whom also took big pay packet cuts working part-time or accepting wage freezes, are faring better. The Resolution Foundation has a list of positives. It cites falling unemployment, which is far lower than anyone expected, to the employment rate, which has risen in every region and nation of the UK in the last two years as reasons to be cheerful. Involuntary part-time and temporary work is also falling and the number of full-time employees is rising. Average pay growth hit 2.1% in the last quarter of 2014 if bonuses are taken into account, 1.7% if they are excluded, which in both cases is far above the 0.5% inflation rate. Combine all these trends and there must be a good cause for heading off a rampant boom in a couple of years time with a rise in rates now. This would be to misread the signs. Until now most new jobs have been part-time or self employed. Low pay is their chief characteristic. After considerable analysis of the labour market, Resolution argued in a recent report that there is no underlying impetus for wages to jump this year. The only reason for the feelgood factor returning is low inflation. Look at the recent GDP figures found business investment falling to levels seen in 2009 while exports remain stagnant. Productivity gains are almost non-existent. In effect, businesses are locked into a crisis mentality that forces them to hoard cash, reject investments in skills, equipment, business process advances and management expertise. Depressingly, one delegate at last week\u2019s annual gathering of manufacturers and engineering companies said Britain was around 15 years behind the US, Germany and Japan in its manufacturing prowess. Then you have the parts of the economy that will be harmed by a rise in interest rates. Think of the housebuyers in London and the south east taking out mortgages worth more than four times their income. Property-obsessed Britain cannot afford a rate hike and no amount of huffing and blowing out its chest by the central bank can change this fact. Last year\u2019s 2.6% increase in GDP, which should be repeated this year, is largely the result of consumer spending, much of it in recent months on unsecured loans. Not long ago BCA Research\u2019s analyst Dhaval Joshi warned his clients that an interest rate rise was doomed to be reversed, despite all the UK\u2019s good economic news. He pointed to Sweden, Australia, eurozone and Norway, which all tried to raise rates during the post-crash recovery only to find it killed high street spending and sent economic growth into reverse. The same would happen in the UK, which means the threat of higher rates, while well intentioned, must be empty.",

      "bodyText": "At the end of a long traipse through the supermarket aisles, the phrase \u2018unexpected item in the bagging area\u2019 at the self-service check-out has raised the ire of many shoppers. In Scott White\u2019s vision for the supermarket of the near future, there would be no irritating interruption, no barcodes to scan and no check-outs. Instead shoppers would simply load their trolleys and walk out of a supermarket with wireless technology registering all of the items they have bought from tiny flexible circuits embedded on the food packaging. It is those small integrated circuits - the equivalent of a silicon chip on a piece of plastic - that PragmatIC Printing, the company which White heads, specialises in. His hope is that the ultra-thin microcircuits will soon feature on wine bottles to tell when a Chablis is at the perfect temperature and on medication blister packs to alert a doctor if an elderly patient has not taken their pills. \u201cWith something which is slimmer than a human hair and very flexible, you can embed that in objects in a way that is not apparent to the user until it is called upon to do something. But also the cost is dramatically lower than with conventional silicon so it allows it to be put in products and packaging that would never justify the cost of a piece of normal electronics,\u201d said White. The main objective is to make everyday objects as intelligent and interactive as our mobile phones, tablets and laptops, he adds. The microcircuits made by PragmatIC, which this year raised \u00a35.4m in funding, appear as patterns on a sheet of plastic. The actual electronics on them are transparent while some metal parts are visible. Much like a barcode is read for information, the circuits are engineered to communicate information such as the cost of an item of clothing or groceries. According to White, they differ from silicon chips which hold information in passports and credit cards in their flexibility, size and price. This technology can be used in transferring data between two devices, such as in contactless payment systems or tagging information onto products. However the cost of doing this has so far restricted the possibilities of how it is used, said White, and is therefore limited to high value goods. \u201cIf you look at what can be done using conventional electronics, it is always going to be constrained by physical form factor [size] and cost,\u201d he said, saying that when people talk of connecting objects at present, the price is prohibitive. \u201cWhat they are actually talking about is relatively expensive objects that you can afford to put a very clever piece of electronics on there, that is going to cost - at the lowest level - tens of cents to add on to something.\u201d The flexible circuits could work in the development of the internet of things, the idea of making everyday items such as cars, utilities and the home connected and working together. The arrival of cheaper and more discreet electronics now allows for coffee cups or labels to be made with the circuits on them, said White. \u201cIt is the combination of those factors [price and size] which allows us to start thinking about doing things with this which wouldn\u2019t even be conceivable with conventional silicon based electronics,\u201d he said. Once that cost factor disappears - White claims the technology to be 10 times and sometimes up to 100 times cheaper than silicon - the possibilities for integrating the electronics increase. One of the first possible uses which has emerged is in blister packets for medication. If combined with a printed battery, a light could show the right time to take the next pill in a packet and the packaging could communicate directly with a doctor. \u201cYou could have something where the electronics in there detects it has been taken, communicates that to the patient\u2019s smartphone which then sends a text message or uploads the information via the internet in some way to say \u2018yes, this has been taken at this particular point in time\u2019 and that can then be tracked,\u201d said White. When printed batteries come to a stage where cost is also not an issue, they could combine with the circuits to display lights on beer bottles for a marketing stunt, he said. The security sector has already proved important for PragmatIC\u2019s business, in instances such as putting the circuits into the letterhead of a legal document to prove its authenticity which is then read later by a smartphone. Because many courts and legal interactions require original documents, they have not been replaced by email, said White. \u201cIt can be done with silicon but it is very expensive so it only makes sense for particularly high end applications - but our technology could conceptually be used by law firms to trace documents,\u201d he said. The microcircuits aimed at mass market items such as groceries are powered wirelessly by the smartphone or the contactless payment terminal which reads them. How long the circuits last is still being gauged although White said they are happy they will extend to two years at least. Other applications could includea \u2018smart\u2019 plaster could be created which could measure moisture levels on a wound to show how it is healing. In a similar manner, a jar of food which is meant to be consumed within a set number of days can have the intelligent packaging applied to illustrate when the produce is off. Tax tracking One of the more unusual uses for flexible integrated circuits is in tax stamps used to show that a customs or excise duty has been paid on items like alcohol or tobacco. \u201cThis is a 160 billion unit market that no-one outside the security industry ever really thinks about, but improving the traceability and/or anti-counterfeit features of these stamps by adding electronic features is potentially very significant for both tax revenue collection and for ensuring that products purchased by customers are genuine and safe,\u201d said White.",

      "bodyText": "Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has admitted that \u201cthumb-sucking\u201d over selling his Tesco stake cost $444m (\u00a3287.6m), one of the biggest losses in his investment company\u2019s history. Buffett\u2019s firm Berkshire Hathaway was still Tesco\u2019s third-largest shareholder last autumn, even after Britain\u2019s biggest grocer had issued four profit warnings and become embroiled in an accounting scandal. Buffett admitted in October he had made a \u201chuge mistake\u201d by investing in Tesco. In his 50th annual letter to shareholders, the 84-year-old veteran investor, known as the Sage of Omaha and one of the world\u2019s richest people, said: \u201cAn attentive investor, I\u2019m embarrassed to report, would have sold Tesco shares earlier. I made a big mistake with this investment by dawdling.\u201d The investment is a blemish on the 84-year-old billionaire\u2019s record. In his 50 years at the helm of Berkshire, he transformed a failing textile company into a sprawling business that has outperformed much of corporate America. Since Buffett bought Berkshire in 1965, the firm\u2019s per-share value has rocketed from $19 to $146,186. He bought his first Tesco shares in 2006. In 2012, he raised his Tesco stake to over 5% despite a shock profit warning. He sold 114m of his 415m Tesco shares in 2013 when he \u201csoured somewhat on the company\u2019s then-management\u201d. The grocer was then run by Philip Clarke. He made a reference to Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman Charlie Munger over his delay in selling off further Tesco shares. \u201cMy leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive. Charlie calls this sort of behaviour \u2018thumb-sucking\u2019. Considering what my delay cost us, he is being kind.\u201d Buffett sold Tesco shares throughout 2014 when the supermarket group\u2019s problems worsened \u201cby the month\u201d. \u201cIn the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: you see a cockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.\u201d Berkshire\u2019s after-tax loss from this investment was $444m, or one-fifth of 1% of Berkshire\u2019s net worth. Since he pulled out, Buffett noted that Tesco had hired new management \u2013 Dave Lewis from Unilever \u2013 \u201cand we wish them well\u201d. Its other investments fared better and Berkshire\u2019s net value increased by $18.3bn last year. The firm increased its stakes in American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo, its biggest four investments. Looking back over the last half century, Buffett took a shot at investment bankers on Wall Street, writing: \u201cThe Street\u2019s denizens are always ready to suspend disbelief when dubious manoeuvres are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings, particularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers.\u201d Addressing the question of his successor at Berkshire, he said he and his board of directors \u201cbelieve we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO,\u201d and who in some respects \u201cwill do a better job than I am doing.\u201d While Buffett did not name that person, Munger, 91, said Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, two top Buffett lieutenants, would be prime candidates. But a successor could also be female: Buffett said \u201cgender should never decide who becomes CEO.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Lloyds has been let off too lightly, but would Labour really rein in the bank?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It is 14 May, the day of Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s annual meeting. Thanks to the reappearance of a dividend, the occasion is less raucous than in recent years. Mention of chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s \u00a311.5m pay packet, part of a \u00a330m bonus pool for top managers, generates some gentle booing. But only one irate shareholder suggests the new corporate slogan, \u201cHelping Britain Prosper\u201d should read \u201cHelping Horta-Os\u00f3rio Prosper\u201d. But, as chairman Lord Blackwell calls for votes on the resolutions before the meeting, there is drama. A nervous figure gets to his feet to announce himself as the representative of UK Financial Investments, the body managing the state\u2019s 24% stake in Lloyds. UKFI, he says, had indicated previously that it would vote in favour of the bank\u2019s remuneration report and pay policy. But fresh instructions were received that morning from chancellor Ed Balls, appointed after Labour\u2019s narrow election victory a week earlier. UKFI will now vote against. Within minutes, a statement from new prime minister Ed Miliband is released: \u201cMy government will support and encourage responsible capitalism. Lloyds\u2019s pay policies, past and present, do not meet this description. As a responsible shareholder, we call on Lloyds\u2019s board to draw up fresh proposals that are acceptable to the millions of taxpayers who saved the bank from collapse.\u201d Unbelievable? Almost certainly, even if Labour wins an overall majority on 7 May. If Labour spied votes in bashing Lloyds\u2019s bonuses, Friday\u2019s statement from shadow Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson would not have been so timid. \u201cPeople will be rightly taken aback by the huge scale of the bonuses being paid \u2013 especially when Lloyds continues to be part-owned by the taxpayer,\u201d said Jamieson. Taken aback? Well, yes, \u00a311.5m \u2013 even as a reward for success over a few years \u2013 has that effect. But it\u2019s not a phrase to make the Lloyds boardroom shudder. Lloyds is the bank where Labour needs to make up its mind. It\u2019s easy to demand restraint at Royal Bank of Scotland; that bank is still loss-making and the state owns 80%. And throwing insults at HSBC\u2019s fat cats is child\u2019s play after the Swiss tax revelations. Lloyds is slightly different. As Horta-Os\u00f3rio spelled out on Friday, the clean-up operation has followed the script. Foreign adventures have been abandoned and 95% of the loans are in the UK. The funding position has been transformed \u2013 even the next eurozone crisis shouldn\u2019t cause alarm. And the rise in the share price means the state\u2019s holding has risen in value by \u00a314bn since 2011. On Labour\u2019s current thinking, the real issue is Lloyds\u2019s dominance of the UK market. Miliband has promised to cap market shares and create new \u201cchallenger\u201d banks by carving out branches from the current big five, just as TSB was extracted from Lloyds. Even post-TSB, Lloyds has most to lose. It has 25% of current accounts and 21% of mortgages and retail deposits; and Halifax, which Lloyds ludicrously calls its in-house \u201cchallenger\u201d brand, is an obvious candidate for liberation. But a radical break-up plan would have upfront costs. The direct one would be the plunge in value of the state\u2019s remaining Lloyds\u2019 shares. The indirect cost would be industry upheaval, with possible knock-on effects on lending. Of course, the price might still be worth paying, if the outcome is greater competition between banks. But Miliband will know that the banks would fight tooth and nail. On Friday, Horta-Os\u00f3rio stated the obvious by saying Lloyds was happy to work with any government; but he then delivered a sermon on how Italy\u2019s fragmented banking sector delivers high prices for customers. His point seemed to be that Labour should concentrate its pro-competition fire on measures to improve lending to small businesses, which everyone agrees is too concentrated, and forget structural reform. Miliband needs to spell out what he really wants. If he makes it to Downing Street, he could force UKFI to vote against Lloyds\u2019s pay report in his first week. That would be a real statement of intent, both about boardroom pay excess and Labour\u2019s willingness to reshape the structure of UK banking. Would he really dare? Back to basics for Morrisons? Morrisons has found its new boss, hiring former Tesco executive David Potts as chief executive. All three top jobs at the grocer are now held by former Tesco top brass who ran the UK\u2019s biggest retailer in its glory days. Undoubtedly, Potts knows how to run a shop: he started stacking shelves at 16 in 1973 and has worked at every level of the food retail business in a near 40-year career. New corporate chiefs usually need months to complete a business review, mull its findings, perhaps employ a few management consultants, and then unveil a turnaround strategy. But Morrisons\u2019s main problems \u2013 and Potts\u2019s action plan \u2013 do not require a lengthy period of chin-scratching to work out: Basic shopkeeping: Staff cuts might save money, but then customer service, product availability and quality monitoring suffer. Potts must revive staff morale and focus on basic retailing standards. Similar moves have delivered swift improvements at Tesco. Technology: Morrisons is still years behind its rivals on systems to help with basics like staff management systems to improve efficiency and accurate product ordering. Top team: Potts\u2019s predecessor, Dalton Philips, had a penchant for management consultants in his top team. Potts needs more top shop-floor experience \u2013 but an influx of more Tesco alumni might not go down well with long-suffering staff. Sort out the brand: One minute the adverts are basic price messages, the next they are glossy celebrity affairs. Morrisons used to stand for great British food at bargain prices. Potts needs to reclaim that space. Good value: Find out how to take on the discounters \u2013 and it\u2019s not the confusing Match &amp; More loyalty card. Potts needs market-leading prices and better quality \u2013 some of the own-label food just isn\u2019t up to scratch. Future growth: Philips moved into convenience stores and linked with Ocado for online shopping. Potts has to make online more profitable and work out whether corner shops are right for Morrisons. The retailer was built on keeping things simple and efficient \u2013 a trick the discounters stole. Airlines slow to pass on fuel savings British Airways\u2019 parent company IAG made a cool \u20ac1bn profit for 2014 and expects to see that figure soar a further 20% higher this year as the benefits of lower oil prices really hit home. So, will passengers be seeing the benefit in lower fares? Since oil prices turned down, airline executives have explained that their prices will not drop dramatically because airlines have hedged their fuel buying and are committed to higher prices. IAG boss Willie Walsh even said that fuel \u201conly\u201d accounts for about a third of airline costs. It\u2019s all a bit rich after years of airlines howling about fuel prices and demanding that air passenger duty be axed to ease their ailing profit margins. There\u2019s some evidence that surcharges have fallen slightly, but with profits climbing fast, passengers might rightly wonder when the mysterious \u201csurcharge\u201d for a now far cheaper commodity will disappear from their ticket price.",

      "body": "<p>It is 14 May, the day of Lloyds Banking Group\u2019s annual meeting. Thanks to the reappearance of a dividend, the occasion is less raucous than in recent years. Mention of chief executive Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio\u2019s \u00a311.5m pay packet, part of a \u00a330m bonus pool for top managers, generates some gentle booing. But only one irate shareholder suggests the new corporate slogan, \u201cHelping Britain Prosper\u201d should read \u201cHelping Horta-Os\u00f3rio Prosper\u201d.</p> <p>But, as chairman Lord Blackwell calls for votes on the resolutions before the meeting, there is drama. A nervous figure gets to his feet to announce himself as the representative of UK Financial Investments, the body managing the state\u2019s 24% stake in Lloyds.</p> <p>UKFI, he says, had indicated previously that it would vote in favour of the bank\u2019s remuneration report and pay policy. But fresh instructions were received that morning from chancellor Ed Balls, appointed after Labour\u2019s narrow election victory a week earlier. UKFI will now vote against.</p> <p>Within minutes, a statement from new prime minister Ed Miliband is released: \u201cMy government will support and encourage responsible capitalism. Lloyds\u2019s pay policies, past and present, do not meet this description. As a responsible shareholder, we call on Lloyds\u2019s board to draw up fresh proposals that are acceptable to the millions of taxpayers who saved the bank from collapse.\u201d</p> <p>Unbelievable? Almost certainly, even if Labour wins an overall majority on 7&#xa0;May. If Labour spied votes in bashing Lloyds\u2019s bonuses, Friday\u2019s statement from shadow Treasury minister Cathy Jamieson would not have been so timid.</p> <p>\u201cPeople will be rightly taken aback by the huge scale of the bonuses being paid \u2013 especially when Lloyds continues to be part-owned by the taxpayer,\u201d said Jamieson. Taken aback? Well, yes, \u00a311.5m \u2013 even as a reward for success over a few years \u2013 has that effect. But it\u2019s not a phrase to make the Lloyds boardroom shudder.</p> <p>Lloyds is the bank where Labour needs to make up its mind. It\u2019s easy to demand restraint at Royal Bank of Scotland; that bank is still loss-making and the state owns 80%. And throwing insults at HSBC\u2019s fat cats is child\u2019s play after the Swiss tax revelations. Lloyds is slightly different.</p> <p>As Horta-Os\u00f3rio spelled out on Friday, the clean-up operation has followed the script.

      "bodyText": "Incoming Standard Chartered boss Bill Winters has a surname suggesting he possesses a thoroughbred showbusiness heritage, following in the footsteps of his peerless namesakes, Shelley, Mike and Bernie. The renowned banker is well-known in the City for his entertainment efforts, thanks to his 2013 appearance in a fundraising video for the Young Vic. In it, he starred alongside other financiers, including Icap\u2019s Michael Spencer and Clearbrook\u2019s Robin Saunders in a sketch where financiers pitched a musical version of The Full Monty to the theatre, only with bankers replacing the steel workers as the talent. Sadly the men failed to follow Saunders\u2019 lead by keeping their shirts on, and Winters then belted out a falsetto almost as wobbly as Spencer\u2019s midriff. It will be difficult to get all of that out of your mind when Standard Chartered (along with Barclays) continues the banking reporting season this week, never mind when Winters takes up his post in June. However, the current question for Standard investors is this: what will the bank look like when the new boss starts? Banking analysts reckon that Standard Chartered needs to sort out its balance sheet, and could do so via a 30% cut in its dividend or a rights issue. Either could happen soon, and before Winters takes to the City stage. Glencore undermined Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg owns shares in the commodity trading group which are worth \u00a33.3bn. That sounds pretty fantastic, unless you can recall the start of his career as a chief exec of publicly listed company in 2011, when that same stake was worth \u00a36bn. It is the sort of value destruction that would often prompt investors to clamour for the chief exec\u2019s head, but so far Glencore\u2019s second-largest shareholder has resisted the temptation to oust himself, and he will be in the boss\u2019s chair to present the company\u2019s results this week. The announcement will come in an environment that represents a marked change in conditions from the time the company floated \u2013 and then when it overpaid to acquire mining group Xstrata in 2013. After a decade-long investment boom, during which the supply of commodities surged, the sector is now in a downturn. Miners everywhere are being forced to slash costs and ditch expensive projects, and last week Glencore said it was cutting production at its Australian coal mines by 15% this year, to tackle a global glut and weak prices. That\u2019s weak prices plural: in commodities as well as in Glasenberg\u2019s stake. Not so hacked off at the Mirror? Trinity Mirror is one of those rare listed companies that\u2019s helping police with their inquires \u2013 yet not also operating within the financial services or heavy industry sectors. The publisher of the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror continues to \u201cco-operate with the Metropolitan Police Service in their ongoing investigations\u201d over phone hacking \u2013 an issue which, after years of denying it was involved, it has suddenly found something it needed to apologise for. That mea culpa appeared in its daily paper last month, along with the company telling the City that the cash it has set aside to cover the costs of the civil claims had increased from \u00a34m to \u00a312m. All of which you\u2019ll be able to read about on the Mirror business pages this week as the company unveils its results \u2013 but despite the nasty bits, the City is still expecting a good news story. Numis predicts a reinstatement of the dividend at 3p a share \u2013 and while analysts at Liberum flag up the uncertainty of hacking costs, they add: \u201cThe question for investors is whether this matter is now materially covered or whether there is the risk of further provisions. Our view is that ... any further provisions are limited.\u201d Even so, the story of hacking at the Mirror may still have some legs.",
