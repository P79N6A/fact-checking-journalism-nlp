      "bodyText": "General Motors warned on Friday that expansive US tariffs on imported vehicles being considered by the Trump administration could lead to \u201ca smaller GM\u201d and risks isolating US businesses from the global market. The car giant \u2013 which employs 180,000 people worldwide \u2013 became the second famous US brand this week to warn of the dangers of Trump\u2019s escalating trade dispute. This week Harley-Davidson said the levies would force it to relocate some production overseas \u2013 a warning that drew a furious response from Donald Trump. The Trump administration launched an investigation into whether imported vehicles posed a national security threat in May, and Trump has repeatedly threatened to quickly impose a 20% import tariff on vehicles. The largest US automaker said in comments filed on Friday with the US commerce department that overly broad tariffs could \u201clead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company, and risk less \u2013 not more \u2013 US jobs\u201d. GM said the tariffs could hike vehicle prices and reduce sales. Even if automakers opted not to pass on higher costs \u201cthis could still lead to less investment, fewer jobs, and lower wages for our employees. The carry-on effect of less investment and a smaller workforce could delay breakthrough technologies.\u201d Toyota filed separate comments opposing the tariffs on Friday saying they would \u201cthreaten US manufacturing, jobs, exports, and economic prosperity\u201d. The company noted that Trump has repeatedly praised the automaker for investing in the United States, including a new $1.3bn joint venture assembly plant in Alabama with Mazda. \u201cThese investments reflect our confidence in the US economy and in the power of the administration\u2019s tax cuts,\u201d Toyota said in its submission. Toyota noted that international automakers assembling vehicles in the United States are based in countries including Japan, German and South Korea \u201cthat are America\u2019s closest allies\u201d. The company added it \u201cis difficult to foresee a situation in which any of them would engage in an armed conflict with the US or cut off supplies of defense materials, and if they did, the United States would have an easy recourse of simply seizing their US plants\u201d. The car companies\u2019 comments come after groups representing America\u2019s largest retailers, car manufacturers and the agriculture industry warned of the \u201cserious negative economic impacts\u201d of the trade dispute and called on Congress to support a bill that would rein in the president\u2019s power to impose tariffs by invoking a threat to national security. \u201cIt is now also increasingly clear that the way the steel and aluminium tariffs have been used will result in retaliatory tariffs from our largest trading partners and closest allies, and that retaliation will have serious negative economic impacts on the United States,\u201d they wrote in a letter to US senators.

      "bodyText": "Pubs and retailers are hoping for an end to the carbon dioxide crisis next week after one major producer of CO2, which is used in brewing, animal slaughter and food packaging, reopened its plant on Friday. The production of crumpets, beer, fizzy drinks, fresh chicken and pork has been affected by shortages of CO2 over the past 10 days, amid longer than expected shutdowns at ammonia and ethanol plants, key producers of the gas, across Europe. Three out of five key UK producers have been shut down, hitting the country particularly hard. The shortages also come at a time of high demand prompted by the hot weather and World Cup football, leaving some businesses short of stock. Ensus said its ethanol plant in Wilton, near Redcar, had already begun producing CO2, a by-product of its fuel production process, which it supplies to Praxair, a major distributor of food-grade gas and dry ice to food and drink firms around the country. The plant produces 340,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. An ammonia and fertiliser plant run by CF Fertilisers, based in Billingham, Teesside, which is another key source of CO2 in the UK, is expected to restart on Monday. JD Wetherspoon anticipates it will return to normal early next week. Currently, a small number of its pubs do not have John Smiths ale or Strongbow cider, both brewed by Heineken, on draught. Heineken said its breweries were working at \u201cfull capacity\u201d to serve customers as soon as possible. However, meat producers warned that some production lines had been suspended because there was not sufficient gas for packing. CO2 is used to help preserve fresh meat in sealed packs.",

      "bodyText": "The \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers is to remove all landlines from office desks by the end of the summer, reflecting a shift to mobile phones. PwC, which has 24 offices across the UK employing about 18,000 people, said the shift to a \u201cmobile first\u201d culture made sense in the modern working environment. A handful of landlines will remain in use for security teams, reception and some client meeting rooms, but by the end of the summer all staff will be mobile-only. Emma Thorogood, PwC\u2019s London director of communications, said the shift had begun a few years ago during the refurbishment of the company\u2019s Leeds offices, when it was decided landlines were superfluous. \u201cThis programme \u2026 is now being rolled out across each of our campuses,\u201d Thorogood told the Guardian. \u201cIt is all about changing working practices \u2013 staff are a lot more agile and flexible. They may be working for clients or working from home. And offices are now more open-plan, and with hotdesking the use of landlines is something we just don\u2019t do any more.\u201d Businesses across the UK are increasingly moving away from landlines. In 2010, UK firms had more than 10m landline numbers, but by the end of last year that had fallen by 35% to 6.4m, according to the communications regulator Ofcom. The time spent by businesses on landline calls has halved, from 38m minutes in 2010 to just under 19m last year. \u201cWith landline usage falling rapidly, we believe that a more mobile-focused policy is a more efficient way of working and supports our people\u2019s increasingly flexible working style more effectively,\u201d said Thorogood. Residential use of landlines has also dropped markedly, although most households still need to pay for one to access broadband. In 2010, UK homes made landline calls totalling more than 90m minutes, but that had fallen to about 35m minutes last year. In March, Ofcom forced BT to cut the cost for customers who have a landline but no broadband by \u00a37 (about 37%) a month. The \u00a384 annual saving will benefit mostly older customers who do not use broadband.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inga Beale, the first female chief executive of Lloyd\u2019s of London, is to step down as the head of the insurance market next year. Her departure comes amid concerns that despite a modernisation drive, it is losing ground to rival centres such as Singapore and failing to stem losses. Last year, Lloyd\u2019s slumped to a \u00a32bn loss as the market was hit by a series of major hurricanes and earthquakes. Beale was appointed chief executive of the 332-year-old insurance market in January 2014, becoming the first woman to hold the role and also one of the UK\u2019s few openly bisexual senior business leaders. In 2015, she topped the power list of the world\u2019s leading 100 LGBT executives. Beale launched the Inclusion@Lloyd\u2019s diversity and inclusion initiative, which is celebrated via the annual Dive In festival. In a statement, she said it had been an honour to run Lloyd\u2019s. \u201cThe decision to leave has been a tough one and when the time comes I will miss the energy, innovative spirit and expertise that I come across every working day,\u201d she said. The exact date of Beale\u2019s departure has not been announced but the search for her successor is already under way.

      "bodyText": "A critical report into accountancy practices at Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire could be published as early as next week after the former owner of BHS failed to win a gagging order via the high court. Taveta, Green\u2019s empire, which includes Topshop and Miss Selfridge, sought to prevent the full publication of the Financial Reporting Council\u2019s damning report on the failures of the auditors responsible for checking BHS\u2019s accounts. The company had sought an interim injunction before a judicial review of the FRC\u2019s report, which the court said it was still considering whether to allow. Mr Justice Nicklin ruled that there were serious issues to be considered in relation to the publication of the report, including whether the FRC had breached its \u201cduty of fairness\u201d by not giving Taveta sufficient opportunity to respond to criticisms of its personnel. He made clear that, if published in its current form, the report risked libelling Tavata staff via \u201cimplied criticisms\u201d. The ruling said these reservations were not sufficient to justify an injunction to block publication of a report by a public body. However, the FRC may be forced to edit its report after Taveta said it would \u201cvigorously defend any claims or allegations\u201d contained in defamatory statements within it. \u201cTaveta\u2019s sole concern was (and remains) to be given a fair opportunity to respond, prior to publication, to those parts of the FRC\u2019s report which unnecessarily criticise Taveta and which were so clearly based on a partial and inaccurate view of the facts,\u201d the company said. The report sheds further light on why Steve Denison, the senior PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant who audited the BHS accounts before its sale for \u00a31, only a year before the department store chain collapsed, was given a 15-year ban and and record personal fine of \u00a3325,000 after he admitted misconduct. PwC was given a record \u00a36.5m fine. In a submission to the court, the accountancy watchdog said it had concluded that the accounts statement stating BHS was a going concern was \u201cobviously insufficient in the face of the pending sale\u201d and some assumptions in the accounts \u201cwere not supported by evidence by PWC and were not reasonable\u201d. Taveta had wanted sections of the FRC analysis to be redacted or changed, arguing that references to members of the former BHS management could cause \u201cserious and potentially irreparable harm\u201d to their reputations. It had been thought that Taveta\u2019s actions were prompted by personal criticisms of Green. However, the ruling on Friday made clear Green was not \u201cadversely affected\u201d. The Financial Reporting Council said it \u201cwill consider the detailed judgment before we publish our report. We hope to do this as soon as possible in the public interest.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Faang-tastic five: can US tech giants continue their stellar rise?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "They are just five companies but they are together worth more than the huge international businesses that make up the entire FTSE 100, more than the companies that comprise Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index, and more than Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40 put together. They are the US technology giants collectively known as Faangs \u2013 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (owned by Alphabet these days) \u2013 and their stellar stock market performances of the past few years has continued in the first six months of 2018 despite a number of serious headwinds. Technology companies in general have been buffeted by Donald Trump\u2019s trade battles, in particular the idea of restricting Chinese investment in US companies and limit American technology exports to China. There have also been individual difficulties \u2013 sometimes of their own making \u2013 for the top companies to confront, but their share price has continued to march on. Facebook saw its shares slide in March when it was revealed it had suffered a massive data breach associated with data firm Cambridge Analytica, but its market value has still climbed 11% since January to value the business at $568bn (\u00a3431m). Google shares have lagged behind the other five on worries about privacy issues and possible increased regulation, but parent company Alphabet still reported an 84% rise in quarterly profits in April. It is now worth $778bn, up 7% on the year. Apple has faced concerns about slowing iPhone sales, especially for its top-of-the-range $1,000 iPhone X, although its latest results seemed to ease those fears. With the boost of an increased investment in the company in May by Warren Buffett, who normally shies away from tech companies, Apple shares have climbed nearly 10% so far this year to value it at $912bn. It is well on track to become the world\u2019s first $1tn company. Meanwhile, Amazon marches on in its own bid for world domination. Its last quarter showed profits had more than doubled to $1.6bn, helped by strong sales in its core business and by its purchase of Whole Foods Markets. It continues to move into new areas, including challenging Sky and BT for premier league football coverage. On Thursday it announced a new march into the pharmacy business with the purchase of Pillpack, a start-up online drugs distribution business \u2013 battering the share prices of huge established players such as CVS and Walgreens Boots Alliance. Despite a series of attacks by Trump, Amazon\u2019s shares have jumped by 45% in the past six months, giving it a market value of $825bn. But out of all the Faangs, the standout success this year has been Netflix. Its market value has more than doubled to $172bn \u2013 making it bigger than Disney. The company has found success with the likes of Stranger Things and Queer Eye, and has signed up Barack and Michelle Obama for their own series. It is perhaps the only one of the five which can still be described as a disruptor, rather than a fully established business. In total, the Faangs are now worth $3.25tn compared with the current valuation of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies of \u00a32.1tn. Their surge since January compares with a flat performance from the FTSE 100, a 2% fall on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 1.6% rise on the S&amp;P 500. These soaring valuations mean that the top slots in the Bloomberg Billionaires list is dominated by tech entrepreneurs, with Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos leading the way with a net worth of $141bn. Can the boom continue? Apart from the continuing uncertainties about Trump\u2019s trade outbursts, there are concerns about tech companies\u2019 current sky high valuations, which rekindle memories of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when loss-making businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing down to earth. There is also the threat of increased regulation following the well-rehearsed privacy issues. But there is a key difference to the dotcom era: these companies are profitable. In a recent note Goldman Sachs strategists Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson dismissed fears of another tech bubble, saying: \u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future.\u201d Trump\u2019s tax reforms earlier this year also allow companies to repatriate cash from overseas, allowing them to pay out more in dividends to investors and providing another support for the shares. Apple, for example, plans to bring back almost $252bn which it currently holds overseas and recently announced a 16% increase in its quarterly dividend and a $100bn increase in its share buyback programme. Russ Mould, investment director at asset manager AJ Bell, said the five \u2013 with the possible exception of Netflix \u2013 are leaders in their fields and are making impressive profits at a time of modest economic growth, providing products and services people are willing to pay for. He added: \u201cThese companies generally have little debt, lots of cash and are thus seen as \u2018safer\u2019 than many other firms \u2013 and these funds are being used to pay out huge dividends and buybacks to shareholders in the case of Apple.\u201d But he warned: \u201cThe danger for bulls is that these valuations leave little margin for error should something \u2013 anything \u2013 go wrong. While [they] are currently seen as almost safe haven stocks, owing to their perceived immunity from wider economic, trade or geopolitical concerns, this very perception and the valuations attributed to them could mean they are anything but safe.\u201d",

The company has found success with the likes of Stranger Things and Queer Eye, and has signed up Barack and Michelle Obama for their own series. It is perhaps the only one of the five which can still be described as a disruptor, rather than a fully established business.</p> <p>In total, the Faangs are now worth $3.25tn compared with the current valuation of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies of \u00a32.1tn. Their surge since January compares with a flat performance from the FTSE 100, a 2% fall on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 1.6% rise on the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p>These soaring valuations mean that the top slots in the Bloomberg Billionaires list is dominated by tech entrepreneurs, with Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos leading the way with a net worth of $141bn.</p> <p>Can the boom continue? Apart from the continuing uncertainties about Trump\u2019s trade outbursts, there are concerns about tech companies\u2019 current sky high valuations, which rekindle memories of the dotcom boom of the late 1990s, when loss-making businesses dominated the stock market before coming crashing down to earth. There is also the threat of increased regulation following the well-rehearsed privacy issues.</p> <p>But there is a key difference to the dotcom era: these companies are profitable. In a recent note Goldman Sachs strategists Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson dismissed fears of another tech bubble, saying: \u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tax reforms earlier this year also allow companies to repatriate cash from overseas, allowing them to pay out more in dividends to investors and providing another support for the shares.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK economy grew at a faster rate than initially thought in the first three months of 2018, raising hopes for a pick-up in growth after the sluggish start to the year. The Office for National Statistics unexpectedly revised higher its third and final estimate for UK growth in the first quarter to 0.2%, after two earlier estimates of 0.1%. Government statisticians said fresh figures from the construction industry and improvements for measuring the sector had nudged up the growth rate. The pound rallied against the dollar on foreign exchanges on Friday, as City traders bet that the revision increased the likelihood that the Bank of England would raise interest rates from as early as August. Threadneedle Street has consistently argued in recent months that the UK economy is stronger than official figures might suggest, which could support a rate rise to 0.75% from 0.5%. Despite the better news for the economy, as Theresa May met her European counterparts on Friday in Brussels to discuss Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, the ONS said household consumption remained subdued and business investment fell in the first quarter. Economists said this confirmed the UK economy remained weak in the first three months of the year. Samuel Tombs , the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cGrowth [was] revised up, but the details are worse than before.\u201d Even though there was a revision for the first quarter, officials said the annual rate of expansion for the economy was unchanged at 1.2% \u2013 the weakest level recorded since the year to the second quarter of 2012. The ONS also downgraded the rate of growth for 2017 from 1.8% to 1.7%, meaning the UK was the only country from the G7 group of wealthy nations to record a slowdown last year. There have been increasingly strident warnings that businesses could relocate jobs and investment to the EU after Brexit, with growing uncertainty over the type of deal ministers want to secure with Brussels. The latest figures showed business investment fell by 0.4% in the first quarter. Britain\u2019s dominant service sector contributed the most to the economy, with growth of 0.3%, while production output \u2013 which includes manufacturing, energy and other utilities \u2013 rose by 0.4%, having been revised down from 0.6%. The construction industry\u2019s output fell by 0.8%, an improvement from the previous estimate for a fall of 2.7%, although the quarter remained the worst for the building trade in more than five years. After a rise in inflation after the Brexit vote and weak wage growth, families increased their borrowing during the first quarter, as real growth in their disposable incomes fell by 0.5%. The household savings ratio, which estimates the amount of money families have to save as a proportion of their total disposable income, fell to 4.1% from 4.5% in the fourth quarter. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said households responded to shrinking pay packets and squeezed incomes by choosing to save less and borrow more. \u201cThis makes sense as families cope with higher than expected price rises, but it\u2019s not a sustainable one.\u201d Britain\u2019s current account deficit, measuring the difference between payments into and out of the country, narrowed by \u00a31.8bn to stand at \u00a317.7bn \u2013 or 3.4% of GDP \u2013 in the first quarter. The gap, which illustrates how dependent the UK is on imports, shrank \u2013 thanks to falling imports and rising volumes of exports. John Hawksworth, the chief economist at PwC, said: \u201cGrowth could pick up a little further in 2019 as real wages recover, but risks are weighted to the downside given uncertainty around the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and the potential threat to global growth from an escalating US-led trade war.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People has topped up its fund for dealing with phone-hacking claims against its newspapers by \u00a37.5m, taking the total amount set aside to \u00a370.5m. Reach, the new name of the publicly listed company formerly known as Trinity Mirror, said on Friday that while it had continued to make progress, fees for lawyers representing claimants were outstripping its estimates. \u201cWhilst we continue to make progress on settling civil claims in relation to phone hacking, the costs associated with settling these claims, predominantly the legal fees of the claimants\u2019 lawyers, are expected to be higher than previously estimated,\u201d the company told investors in a stock market filing. \u201cAlthough there remains uncertainty as to how these matters will progress, the board remains confident that the exposures arising from these historical events are manageable and do not undermine the delivery of the group\u2019s strategy.\u201d In October, lawyers representing TV presenter John Leslie, actor Ralf Little and former Celebrity Big Brother contestant Chantelle Houghton claimed in high court that the board of Reach and its legal team were aware of hacking and did not stop it at the company\u2019s newspapers. Lawyers for Trinity Mirror told the court the evidence presented did not show that company executives or the legal team were aware of hacking. Last summer, the company said it had settled more than 80% of phone hacking cases against it. Since 2015, Reach has faced a series of hacking claims from celebrities and public figures. Last April, the company settled with 44 people, including Jeffrey Archer, Patsy Kensit, Denise van Outen, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, the former home secretary Charles Clarke and the ex-England football manager Kevin Keegan, for undisclosed sums. Last May, a payout to Elizabeth Hurley is believed to have broken the record \u00a3260,250 paid to Sadie Frost by the publisher in 2015, which at the time was thought to be the single biggest privacy damages payout since the phone-hacking scandal broke in 2010. In November 2016, Reach paid out more than \u00a3500,000 to settle phone-hacking claims by 29 people, including the entertainer Les Dennis, TV presenter Natasha Kaplinsky and EastEnders actor Steve McFadden. In December 2015, the Crown Prosecution Service said no further action would be taken against companies and journalists accused of phone hacking. The CPS said there was insufficient evidence to bring corporate charges against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK and criminal cases against 10 current and former employees on newspapers owned by Reach.",

Thank you for all the comments and please join us again on Monday. Have a good weekend. AM The pound is still going (relatively) strong against the dollar, up 0.5% at $1.3145. It is not doing so well against the euro, down 0.1% at \u20ac1.1290. The euro has held on to its gains against the dollar, currently up 0.6% at $1.1641. Over in the US, consumers only slightly increased their spending in May - despite rising wages - as prices increased at the fastest rate in more than six years. Personal spending grew by 0.2% last month, down from 0.5% in April and weaker than the 0.4% predicted by economists. A fall in spending on services like household utilities was partially offset by higher spending on items such as recreational goods. Personal income - measuring Americans\u2019 pretax earnings from salaries and other sources including investments - rose by 0.4% in May, according to the figures from the US Commerce Department. The price index for personal consumption expenditures - the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation - increased by 2.3% in the year to May, which was the highest rate since March 2012. Barely a week after the EU announced a debt deal for Greece - saying the country\u2019s long-running economic crisis was over - the International Monetary Fund has sounded the alarm. Helena Smith reports from Athens. Greece will need significant further debt relief if it is to have problem-free access to international markets \u201cover the longer run.\u201d That, in a nutshell, is the message from the IMF today, which said Greece\u2019s pledge to achieve a primary surplus of 3.5% annually, was \u201cvery optimistic \u2026 [and] ambitious.\u201d Speaking eight days after the eurozone agreed to medium-term debt relief for Athens \u2013 extending maturities and prolonging interest payments on about a third of its \u20ac320bn debt pile \u2013 the IMF\u2019s mission chief for Greece insisted it wasn\u2019t enough. Peter Dohlman said: We are concerned this improvement in debt indicators \u2026 can only be sustained over the long run under what appear to be very optimistic \u2013 maybe ambitious is a better word \u2013 assumptions on GDP growth and Greece\u2019s ability to run high primary surpluses for an extended period of time. Without more measures, Greece\u2019s debt load would be unsustainable he warned, adding that if there was a let-up in reforms to boost competitiveness, growth would be limited. Burdened with the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro zone, Greece will exit its third and final international rescue programme in August. Time for another look at European markets, boosted today by the news that EU leaders had agreed a migration deal in Brussels, easing fears of political instability. FTSE 100: +0.7% at 7,666 Germany\u2019s DAX: 1.4% at 12,344 France\u2019s CAC: +1.3% at 5,344 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1% at 21,644 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 9,665 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +1% at 381 The insurance firm Lloyd\u2019s of London has announced that its chief executive Dame Inga Beale will step down next year after five years. The company did not give a reason for her departure and said the search for her replacement had begun. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman at Lloyd\u2019s, said: In her five years at Lloyd\u2019s, Inga has set in motion a series of changes aimed at modernising the market and making it more efficient and inclusive. Her boldness and persistence have generated the momentum required to bring about real change. I have very much enjoyed working with Inga, and I am grateful for the support she has given me in my first year as chairman\u201d Inga\u2019s leaving date will be confirmed in due course and the search for her successor is underway. Beale said: The decision to leave has been a tough one and when the time comes I will miss the energy, innovative spirit and expertise that I come across every working day. Leading Lloyd\u2019s is an honour and I am proud to have played a part in ensuring that it remains relevant and fit for purpose for the future. As the first half of 2018 draws to a close, analysts at Hargreaves Lansdown have done a review of markets. The FTSE is slightly below where it started the year, but thanks to dividends, investors are still in positive territory. Despite fears of overvaluation, the US has proved the best performing major stock market this year, though most of the returns for UK investors have come from a strengthening dollar. After a strong run, the German stock market has fallen from grace, as cracks in the eurozone resurfaced, and trade tensions have stoked concerns over the exporting giants of the German economy. A collapse in the share price of Deutsche Bank hasn\u2019t helped matters either. FTSE\u2019s top five performing stocks in the first half: 1. Ocado: +160% 2. Evraz: +49% 3. Sky: +44% 4. Next: +34% 5. Sainsbury\u2019s: +33% ...and the five worst performers: 1. Micro Focus International: -50% 2. Standard Life Aberdeen: -26% 3. British American Tobacco: -23% 4. Sage Group: -22% 5. Randgold Resources: -22% Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at the firm, says: In the UK, Ocado has been the stand-out performer. After sealing a deal with the US grocery giant Kroger, the online supermarket has thrust its way into the FTSE 100. Its meteoric rise has inflicted serious pain on the hedge funds who bet against it, and they will still be licking their considerable wounds. At the other end of proceedings, a profit warning and a chief executive resignation has done for the Micro Focus share price. Likewise the shine has come off Standard Life Aberdeen following last year\u2019s merger. The pick-up in eurozone inflation is another factor behind a stronger euro today, on top of the EU deal on migrants, says John Dolan from currency firm Fexco Corporate Payments: The Euro enjoyed a boost from the overnight deal in Brussels, and this was consolidated by the news that eurozone inflation has ticked up. While the increase in eurozone inflation to 2.0% was widely expected, and will do little to soften Mario Draghi\u2019s dovish dogma in the short term, the combination of economic growth and rising prices will eventually force the ECB into normalising monetary policy. All of which has helped the Euro hold onto its early morning gains against the Dollar, and the single currency is set to end the month on a high. Annual inflation in the eurozone edged up to 2% in June from 1.9% in May according to the \u2018flash\u2019 Eurostat, the region\u2019s statistics office. It is the highest rate in more than a year, as higher energy prices pushed price growth above the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just below 2%. Inflation was also pushed up by higher prices of food, alcohol and tobacco. The rise will be welcome news for Mario Draghi and his colleagues on the governing council of European Central Bank, providing justification for their decision to phase out the bank\u2019s massive bond-buying programme by the end of the year. The number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to a four-month high of 64,526 in May, according to figures from the Bank of England. It was up from 62,941 in April and beat economists expectations of 62,200 approvals. However, the data also reflected a weak backdrop for consumers, with 8.5% growth in unsecured consumer lending the weakest since November 2015. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst, is not impressed by the upward revision to UK GDP and says it shouldn\u2019t be soothing fears. Headlines can be misleading and while an upgrade is always welcome, it comes purely down to a revision to the contribution of the construction sector which contracted by only a miserable 0.8% against a previously abhorrent estimate of 2.7%. Q1 is still the quarter of the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019 and sizeable disruption to consumption habits as a result and while Q2 data will be higher, it is unlikely to do anything than confirm the malaise at the heart of the UK\u2019s economic engine. UK growth was revised up after more the ONS received more data from the construction firms, which showed a fall in output in the sector was smaller than previously estimated. Construction output fell by 0.8% between January and March, and not by a sharper 2.7% according to earlier estimates from the ONS. It was the weakest growth since the third quarter of 2012. Despite the upward revision, the ONS said Britain\u2019s building industry struggled over the first quarter, and the Beast from the East wasn\u2019t entirely to blame: While there is some evidence of an impact from the bad weather on this industry, our initial analysis shows weakness in construction throughout the quarter, not just the period during the bad weather. The pound is up 0.7% against the dollar to $1.3169, building on earlier gains after the ONS revised up UK growth in the first quarter to 0.2% from 0.1%. Sterling was briefly up against the euro, but has edged lower again, down 0.1% at \u20ac1.1296. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2018, slightly faster than the 0.1% previously estimated by the Office for National Statistics. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, explains the revision: GDP growth was revised up slightly in the first three months of 2018, with later construction data, and significantly improved methods for measuring the sector, nudging up growth. These improved methods, introduced as part of ONS\u2019s annual update to its figures, will lead to better early estimates of the construction sector with smaller revisions in the future. Overall, households have now been borrowers for six consecutive quarters as rising prices have continued to squeeze domestic budgets. Investment by both local and central government and the private sector fell, with spending on buildings, machinery and software all seeing notable falls. MPs on the influential Treasury committee have issued a warning to the Bank of England over the lack of women in senior roles. In the first intervention of its kind, the committee warned it could block the appointment of male candidates to its main policymaking committees. The Bank\u2019s nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates, includes only one woman - Silvana Tenreyro. Nicky Morgan, Conservative MP and chair of the committee, said MPs were \u201cprepared to take progress on this matter into account\u201d. Read our full story here: Downing Street says BAE Systems\u2019 Australian shipbuilding win is the biggest Naval defence contract for a decade. British defence manufacturer, BAE Systems, is one of the FTSE 100\u2019s biggest risers this morning after it won a \u00a320bn contract to build Australian warships. The company will build nine new ships at the Osborne Naval Shipyard in Adelaide. The ships will be modelled on BAE\u2019s Type 26 global combat ship and will be known as the Hunter class. Theresa May said the export of a British design for the frigates would be an \u201cenormous boost\u201d for the UK economy, although the jobs associated with the programme will be created in Australia. Production of the first ship is expected to start in early 2020s, BAE said. Shares are up 2.4% at 647p. Trading is underway across Europe and the mood is upbeat: FTSE 100: +1% at 7,691 Germany\u2019s DAX: +1.2% at 12,328 France\u2019s CAC: +1.4% at 5,350 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +1.5% at 21,751 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.9% at 9,675 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The euro is rallying after EU leaders in Brussels broke the deadlock on migration talks after a marathon session lasting nearly 10 hours. Investors fearful of an escalation of political instability breathed a sigh of relief when Donald Tusk, head of the European Council, tweeted the news shortly before dawn. The euro jumped to $1.1650, and is currently up 0.6% at $1.1642. It is also up 0.3% against the pound at 87.5p. Fears had been mounting that a deal in Brussels would not be struck, when Italy threatened to veto the text, unless other EU states did more to help with people arriving on Italian shores. Jasper Lawler from London Capital Group explains why traders felt relief at the deal: The migrant crisis in Europe threatened German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s fragile coalition, which was in danger of collapsing if she left the summit without a deal. The euro picked up from \u20ac1.157 to \u20ac1.162 in the space of a few short minutes. The deal will also reassure investors of broader political stability in the European Union, lowering the risk of any further breakaway from a member country.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve had posh chocolate, premium mixer drinks, artisan gin and craft beer \u2013 now ice lollies have become the latest target of a foodie makeover. Whereas the choice used to be standard fruit flavours such as strawberry and orange in bright colours and novelty shapes, a wave of new British food brands have begun serving up \u201cgourmet lollies\u201d aimed at adults, with adventurous flavours ranging from Earl Grey tea to alcoholic watermelon martini popsicles. The next big thing, the posh lolly experts predict, will be dipping them into shot glasses containing the same sort of alcohol for a particularly intense flavour hit. \u201cFrozen is one of the markets that has not evolved,\u201d explains James Rae, a co-founder of the London-based Pops, which has scored a hit with its alcoholic \u201cpremium popsicles\u201d. \u201cLook at what what has happened with tonic water, confectionery and craft beer over the past five years,\u201d Rae continues. \u201cFrozen food was boring and controlled by the usual suspects. Very few people were doing anything with lollies. There was a gap for an adult-focused product that was refreshing and quirky.\u201d The adult ice lolly market is one of the fastest-growing product areas in the ice cream market, with sales up 23% to \u00a340m in the past year , according to Kantar Worldpanel, which tracks UK grocery sales trends. Much of the boost is down to the success of boozy ice lollies, with supermarket chains such as Aldi having already spotted the trend and launching its Gianni\u2019s range of cocktail-flavoured popsicles. While British consumers eat ice cream all year round \u2013 the market has surged by nearly 10% to break through the \u00a31bn sales barrier over the last year \u2013 it takes a heatwave to trigger a rush on ice lollies. According to sales data, ice lolly sales only really take off when the temperature tops 24C. Mass-market ice cream makers have also come under pressure as consumers seek healthier or more artisanal versions but new makers have flourished \u2013 such as Little Moons, with its Japanese-style mochi gelato balls, which can be skewered together to create a lolly. It is not only a UK trend. Unilever, the biggest ice cream maker in the world and the producer of Magnum, Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s and Wall\u2019s, blamed disappointing summer sales last year on competition from the low-calorie brand Halo Top, which has taken America by storm. \u201cSince May we\u2019ve not had chance to breathe,\u201d Rae adds. Ice pops sales have doubled this year and the company \u2013 whose financial backers include the Fever-Tree co-founder Charles Rolls and the gastronome Loyd Grossman \u2013 is forecasting sales of \u00a33m for 2019 from a standing start four years ago. Tesco has just agreed to stock its Pimm\u2019s-flavoured lolly. Another brand trying to raise the stakes is Ice Kitchen, which is run by Cesar Roden, the grandson of the food writer Claudia Roden, \u201cWe want to be a challenger to Wall\u2019s and other mainstream brands,\u201d says Roden, whose bestsellers include the mojito poptail. \u201cThese are chef-inspired lollies with natural ingredients.\u201d \u201cWe believe that the alcoholic ice cream trend is here to stay,\u201d Roden says. \u201cAldi has brought a lot more awareness to alcoholic lollies.\u201d He believes consumers will become more experimental and predicts the next trend will be dipping lollies into a shot glass of paired alcohol. \u201cThe ice lollies soak up a lot of the alcohol, which then creates a whole new tasting experience.\u201d Taste test We asked three Guardian lolly lovers to taste and test some of the new posh popsicles. Top 5 Ice Kitchen \u2013 mojito 5/5 (alcoholic) \u201cRefreshing packed with lots of flavour.\u201d \u201cVery tasty and good news is it has low calories!\u2019\u2019 \u201cA nice palette cleanser after a summer barbecue.\u201d \u00a33.99 for three-pack Pops \u2013 Pimm\u2019s 5/5 (alcoholic) \u201cTastes like summer (and certainly Pimms).\u2019\u2019 \u201cIdeal accompaniment to watching Wimbledon.\u2019\u2019 \u201cWhat\u2019s nice is that you can taste all the individual flavours in it \u2013 as if you were having the drink itself.\u201d \u00a35.99 for three-pack Gianni\u2019s by Aldi \u2013 G&amp;T 4/5 (alcoholic) \u201cTastes just like a G&amp;T \u2013 if you like it strong!\u201d \u201cVery zesty and strong in flavour, plus a nice texture.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d buy them again as it\u2019s a fun way to keep cool with pals.\u201d \u00a32.99 for four-pack Ice Kitchen \u2013 peach and hibiscus 4/5 (non-alcoholic) \u201cThe real slices of peach add a great texture to the ice lolly.\u201d \u201cThe colours are nice (dark purple and orange) and the flavours are just as good.\u2019\u2019 \u201cI would buy this in the local shop if they had it, for sure!\u201d \u00a33.99 for three-pack Little Moons \u2013 mango mochi 4/5 (non-alcoholic) \u201cUnusual soft outer texture but really nice creamy mango flavour inside.\u2019\u2019 \u201cI enjoyed this more than I thought, considering it\u2019s a weird squidgy ball with ice cream inside. It does taste great, though.\u2019\u2019 \u201cWould take these to a dinner party as a fun pudding \u2013 or just eat all of them myself before I go!\u201d \u00a34.99 for six-pack Not so nice Pops \u2013 fros\u00e9 (ros\u00e9 &amp; raspberry) 0/5 (alcoholic) \u201cSynthetic raspberry flavour; tastes like a cheap shot!\u201d \u201cTastes nothing like ros\u00e9 \u2013 bitter and left a strong aftertaste.\u201d \u201cNot sure I\u2019d ever want ros\u00e9 as an ice lolly.\u201d \u00a35.99 for three-pack Coco Loco by Aldi \u2013 coconut water 0/5 (non-alcoholic) \u201cSmells like holiday but don\u2019t let the lovely smell deceive you.\u2019\u2019 \u201cCouldn\u2019t eat more than a single bite.\u201d \u201cJust no.\u201d \u00a31.99 for four-pack Pops \u2013 watermelon martini 1/5 (alcoholic) \u201cTastes like a really weak watermelon Haribo \u2026 not nice.\u2019\u2019 \u201cI was excited to try this but it tastes nothing like a watermelon or a martini \u2026 just a bit odd.\u2019\u2019 \u201cSynthetic and tasteless.\u201d \u00a35.99 for three-pack",

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019ve just written off the thick end of \u00a3200m on a single job, a sum equivalent to 25% of your company\u2019s now-reduced stock market value, you might prefer to run away from more work in the same line of business. Not Stagecoach. The first set of annual figures since the east coast mainline debacle delivered a thumping 35% dividend cut to shareholders but chief executive Martin Griffiths championed \u201cthe good opportunities\u201d the group still sees in the UK rail market. Stagecoach will re-bid for the west coast main line and East Midlands Trains franchises and make a pitch for the new Southeastern gig. A sucker for punishment? The corporate line is that lessons have been learned from the east coast, where Stagecoach offered \u00a33.3bn to run the London to Edinburgh service to 2023 but couldn\u2019t make the numbers work after only three years. The chief lesson, surely, is not to make heroic assumptions about how many more customers will wish to use the service. Stagecoach agrees, but its mea culpa would carry more weight if it contained fewer references to \u201cfactors outside of our control\u201d. Nobody is forced to bid. For all that, the plan to stay in rail is probably correct. Or, at least, it\u2019s justifiable on the grounds that transport secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s new \u201cforecast revenue mechanism\u201d is worth a look. The idea is that the Department for Transport will shoulder more of the revenue risk but get a bigger slice of the returns in the event of pleasant surprises. The structure sounds reasonable, but the devil will lie in the detail inevitably. After the recent fiasco with timetable changes, few would bet against Grayling, Network Rail and the train operators conjuring up another fine mess in which everybody blames everybody else. On balance, though, in the position of Stagecoach shareholders, you\u2019d probably still sanction more rail adventures, even after a plunge in the share price from 400p to 140p over the last three years. On the right financial terms, good franchises are still worth having. It remains to be seen how Grayling would manage the political heat that could accompany more awards to Stagecoach after the east coast failure, but that\u2019s his problem \u2013 or his successor\u2019s. Thames Water cleaning up its image? Thames Water is on a mission to shed its reputation for being perhaps the greediest water company in the land. The first efforts have been OK. The Cayman Islands subsidiaries are being dismantled; the boardroom line-up has been overhauled; and, after the departure of unloved Australian financial house Macquarie, the shareholder register is dominated by pension funds who sing the virtues of long-termism. Now comes reform to boardroom pay. Chief executive Steve Robertson won\u2019t get a bonus for two years, which is perfectly proper since overhauling Thames will take at least three years and he should judged on the final results. The structure of his incentive package is also improved since almost all the targets relate to stuff that involves improving the quality of the assets or the lot of customers, as opposed to enriching the owners. Reducing leaks is 50% of the top priority. Jolly good, but the flip-side of Robertson not getting a bonus for two years is that he could get a thumping great pay-out in 2020. For an \u201con target\u201d performance, he would receive \u00a33.75m. If the company hits the \u201cstretch\u201d targets, the sum could be as much as \u00a37.5m, according to the annual report. Environment secretary, Michael Gove, among others, has highlighted the sheer size of boardroom rewards as a reason why the water industry\u2019s public image is so poor. Thames Water\u2019s new incentives may be sensibly structured, but one suspects even \u00a33.75m would still be near-impossible to explain to the captive customers.",

Analysis by rail regulators in 2013 found East Coast required less subsidy than any other line when in public hands, while it delivered more than \u00a31bn to the Treasury.

It remains to be seen how Grayling would manage the political heat that could accompany more awards to Stagecoach after the east coast failure, but that\u2019s his problem \u2013 or his successor\u2019s.</p> \n<h2>Thames Water cleaning up its image?</h2> \n<p>Thames Water is on a mission to shed its reputation for being perhaps the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/nov/24/thames-water-explains-why-nationalisation-is-suddenly-popular\">greediest water company</a> in the land. The first efforts have been OK. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/23/thames-water-cayman-island-subsidiaries-chairman\">Cayman Islands subsidiaries are being dismantled</a>; the boardroom line-up has been overhauled; and, after the departure of unloved Australian financial house Macquarie, the shareholder register is dominated by pension funds who sing the virtues of long-termism.<br></p> \n<p>Now comes reform to boardroom pay. Chief executive Steve Robertson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/27/thames-water-drains-chiefs-bonus-over-missed-leak-targets\">won\u2019t get a bonus for two years</a>, which is perfectly proper since overhauling Thames will take at least three years and he should judged on the final results. The structure of his incentive package is also improved since almost all the targets relate to stuff that involves improving the quality of the assets or the lot of customers, as opposed to enriching the owners. Reducing leaks is 50% of the top priority.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jolly good, but the flip-side of Robertson not getting a bonus for two years is that he could get a thumping great pay-out in 2020. For an \u201con target\u201d performance, he would receive \u00a33.75m. If the company hits the \u201cstretch\u201d targets, the sum could be as much as \u00a37.5m, according to the <a href=\"https://corporate.thameswater.co.uk/annualresults\">annual report</a>.</p> \n<p>Environment secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/01/michael-gove-warns-water-companies-over-concerning-behaviour\">Michael Gove</a>, among others, has highlighted the sheer size of boardroom rewards as a reason why the water industry\u2019s public image is so poor. Thames Water\u2019s new incentives may be sensibly structured, but one suspects even \u00a33.75m would still be near-impossible to explain to the captive customers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A committee of MPs has warned the Bank of England that it could block the appointment of male candidates to its main policymaking committees to arrest a decline in female representation. In the first known example of MPs threatening to reject candidates for senior public sector jobs to improve diversity, the Treasury select committee said it would look at the progress made by Threadneedle Street in appointing more women to senior roles before it endorses the next appointment. Committee chair, Nicky Morgan, said the next time the Bank of England advertised senior jobs for its three main policymaking committees \u2013 the monetary policy committee (MPC), financial policy committee (FPC) and prudential regulation committee (PRC) \u2013 MPs were \u201cprepared to take progress on this matter into account\u201d. The move is a shot across the bows of the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who makes the final decision on the appointment of senior central bank officials. MPs have traditionally rubber-stamped Bank committee appointments following a hearing with each candidate in parliament, but have recently become concerned at the lack of women reaching the institution\u2019s higher echelons. The next appointment will be to fill a vacancy on the FPC next February and then the role of governor when Carney steps down in June 2019. Morgan wrote to the most senior civil servant at the Treasury, the permanent secretary Sir Tom Scholar, following the appointment of academic Jonathan Haskel to the MPC and Bradley Fried as head of its oversight board, the court of the Bank of England. Haskel was appointed ahead of four women on the shortlist. Morgan said: \u201cWhilst the Committee has approved the appointments of ProfHaskel and Mr Fried, it\u2019s disappointing that the gender balance at the most senior levels of the Bank of England will not be improved.\u201d The Bank\u2019s annual report earlier this month revealed that the proportion of women in senior roles fell from 30% to 29% while the share of black and minority ethnic (BAME) staff in senior positions fell from 6% to 5%. Carney has set ambitious targets to push the proportion of women in senior roles to 35% and the equivalent BAME figure to 13% by 2022. Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP for Leeds West and chair of the business select committee, said at the time of Haskel\u2019s appointment that it was \u201ctruly staggering\u201d that the Treasury had failed to appoint a woman, adding: \u201cThe top jobs [at the Bank] seem to be reserved for men.\u201d Morgan said: \u201cThe Committee raised concerns about the Bank\u2019s gender diversity following the appointment of Sir Dave Ramsden and Prof Silvana Tenreyro in October 2017. Since October, only three out of 10 public appointments and reappointments to the Bank\u2019s committees have been women. \u201cWith the Bank\u2019s female representation in senior management roles at the Bank decreasing to 29% last year, it seems increasingly unlikely that the Bank will meet its own diversity strategy to have 35% female participation in senior management positions by 2020.\u201d Scholar said in a letter to Morgan that Hammond\u2019s chief economic adviser, Clare Lombardelli, had managed the recruitment process and contacted 87 potential applicants, 44 of whom were women. Despite receiving replies from only eight women, while 19 men replied, he said four women and one man were interviewed. Haskel was the chancellor\u2019s preferred choice. A recent examination by the committee of female employment across the finance industry highlighted \u201crecruitment practices and workplace culture that are often barriers to women progressing to the most senior levels\u201d. Morgan said the Bank and the Treasury must explain how they would address such barriers to improve the diversity in public appointments. She added that the committee was \u201cprepared to take progress on this matter into account in the next appointment made to any of the Bank of England\u2019s policy committee.\u201d",
