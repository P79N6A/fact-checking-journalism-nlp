      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s shares rose 15% on the idea of combining with Asda. One can see why. The chief executive, Mike Coupe \u2013 who was on Monday captured on camera by ITV singing \u201cWe\u2019re in the money\u201d \u2013 is promising a \u00a3500m-a-year boost to profits. Tesco would be knocked off its top perch. And Walmart, after a bruising few years in the UK, is selling Asda on loser\u2019s terms \u2013 the Americans have even agreed to tow away Asda\u2019s pension fund. Fine \u2013 but don\u2019t sing too soon. This deal needs regulatory approval and then has to be made to work. There are reasons to be sceptical. First, Coupe\u2019s view of how the Competition and Markets Authority will view his \u201chistoric\u201d reshaping of the UK grocery market sounded optimistic. He said the CMA applies \u201ca higher level of sophistication\u201d these days than the \u201cblunt fascia test\u201d that prevailed in 2003 when Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s were barred from buying Safeway. Does it really? It is true the CMA is fond of measuring competition at a local level and that discounters Aldi and Lidl are now forces in the land. But Sainsbury\u2019s/Asda plus Tesco would control more than half the UK grocery market, which is close to being a working definition of a duopoly. However many local studies are produced, that concentration of national power is hard to ignore. Coupe claimed an expanded Sainsbury\u2019s would have only 26% of the market, not the 31% estimated by independent agencies, but he included M&amp;S and Boots in his reckoning, which showed how hard he was straining to position this deal within traditional parameters. Unless one is living off a diet of sandwiches and Lucozade, Boots is not a grocer. This deal is a bet on a CMA that is being asked to sanction a huge structural change in a market where competition is working well. Sainsbury\u2019s and Walmart will inevitably be told to sell some stores, and would probably be relieved if the figure is only 70 or so. At double that, though, some of the commercial benefits will evaporate. A second problem is Coupe\u2019s assertion that consumers will benefit via 10% price cuts on \u201cmany of the products customers buy regularly\u201d. How many products? How long will the price cuts last? And what about products that are bought less often? He didn\u2019t say. While shareholders are promised \u00a3500m-a-year of quick savings, shoppers are being asked to take a lot on trust, as the CMA will surely also note. Nor did Coupe say that Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda will sell identical products at identical prices after equalising buying terms. In fact, the proposed \u201ctwo-brand\u201d strategy suggests the opposite approach. How will that work? If a common buying team is buying Coca-Cola or Heinz ketchup at a fixed price, surely Sainsbury\u2019s customers in the new world would expect to pay the same as Asda shoppers. Fluffy boardroom talk about the different \u201cbrand positioning\u201d may cut little ice. One can admire Coupe\u2019s imagination and opportunism. He has correctly identified Walmart\u2019s weariness with the UK and, rather than sit around waiting for Amazon to make its inevitable attack on the UK supermarket sector, he is trying to make preparations. That\u2019s what he\u2019s paid to do. More UK taxes, presumably from Asda not posting dividends across the Atlantic, will play well with UK politicians. His broadside against \u201cmultinational\u201d suppliers with fatter profit margins than supermarkets \u2013 who are thus able to trim their prices \u2013 also hit the mark. But his Asda deal faces 12-18 months of intense regulatory scrutiny. It\u2019s not yet over the line, and the gamble will rebound on Sainsbury\u2019s if the CMA plays rough.",

      "bodyText": "The National Crime Agency is launching a fresh probe into a multimillion-pound banking fraud at HBOS to decide if there should be a new, full-blown criminal investigation. The announcement is a setback for Lloyds Banking Group, which bought HBOS in 2008. Six individuals, including two former HBOS employers, were jailed in 2017 for committing the fraud, which centred on the Reading branch of the bank. It was described by the judge as an \u201cutterly corrupt scheme\u201d that left small business owners cheated, defeated and penniless. The scam took place between 2003 and 2008 and involved a former HBOS employee, Lynden Scourfield, who was in charge of looking after troubled businesses. He was bribed by David Mills, the owner of a financial consultancy, to load loans on to struggling companies and refer them to Mills\u2019s business. Many of the firms went bankrupt and some of the owners lost their homes. However, while the jail sentences handed down totalled more than 47 years, controversy over the case has continued to rumble on. The NCA said it would lead a pre-investigative evidential review into allegations of fraud concerning the HBOS branch in response to a request from Thames Valley police. It added that the review, which is set to take six months, would look at allegations that fell outside the scope of the original police investigation. The NCA said a number of companies had reported allegations of significant fraud, and that \u201cthese include allegations of asset-stripping through the use of corrupt consultants as well as allegations of fraud and money laundering. The sums of money involved could be significant, running to many millions.\u201d Lloyds had denied there was any wrongdoing at its Reading branch until two of its former employees were convicted, but in September 2017, the police and crime commissioner of Thames Valley police claimed HBOS must have known of the fraudulent activities inside its Reading branch as long ago as February 2008.

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s has spelled out the terms of its planned merger with rival Asda and promised that shoppers would get a 10% cut in the price of popular foods as a result. It said it would pay Walmart, the US owner of Leeds-based Asda, nearly \u00a33bn in cash and give it a 42% stake in the combined business to complete the deal. The companies said both brand names would be retained and there were no plans for store closures as a result of creating the group comprising 2,800 stores with sales of \u00a351bn, overtaking Tesco to become the UK\u2019s largest retailer, with a workforce of 330,000 people. However, the Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, said some stores could be sold off to other grocers if required by competition regulators. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, warned of the impact of the deal on suppliers and the GMB general secretary, Tim Roache, said the deal could hit jobs. John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said: \u201cUltimately there has to be job losses and the suppliers will have to pay through lower prices \u2026 customers will see reduced choice.\u201d However, responding to an urgent question about the deal in parliament, the business minister, Andrew Griffiths, appeared to support the merger, saying the two grocers were trying \u201cto get ahead of the curve\u201d in a competitive market. Sainsbury\u2019s shares soared 20% as the stock market welcomed the details of the deal on Monday morning and closed up 15% at 320p, their highest level since 2014. The proposed merger of the UK\u2019s second and third largest retailers is expected to trigger a major competition inquiry. Analysts predicted that if the deal was approved, it would result in at least 75 store disposals to ensure competition did not suffer. It would be the biggest shake-up in the market since Morrison bought Safeway in 2003, when dozens of stores changed hands. Sainsbury\u2019s said the merger would not be completed until the second half of 2019 as regulators will have to calculate the potential overlaps between the two groups\u2019 stores and the impact on local competition. Coupe, who plans to lead the merged business, said the deal was a \u201ctransformational opportunity to create a new force in UK retail, which will be more competitive and give customers more of what they want now and in the future\u201d. He insisted the merger would be \u201ca great deal for everyone\u201d, with benefits for customers, staff, suppliers and shareholders. Coupe said the retail landscape had changed dramatically since the Morrisons/Safeway deal, with the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl and online specialists led by Amazon. \u201cIt\u2019s never been more competitive and customers have more choices than ever, not just in the grocery sector but in other retail sectors. You can see the consequences of that playing out every day,\u201d Coupe said. The CMA confirmed the deal would be subject to investigation and Sainsbury\u2019s said it had asked the watchdog to skip straight to a detailed \u201cphase two\u201d stage. Coupe said regulators would be mainly concerned by the impact on consumers who, he said, would benefit from lower prices and more choice in deciding how they shopped as a result of investment in technology. He said the merger would deliver at least \u00a3500m in cost savings and other benefits, largely as a result of improved efficiency and better deals with suppliers. John Hannett, the general secretary of the Usdaw union, said: \u201cBoth companies operate significant nationwide distribution networks employing thousands of staff. We will be seeking urgent clarification on the future for those workers.\u201d Coupe admitted that some head office functions were likely to be combined over time but insisted new jobs would also be created. Asda will continue to be run from Leeds with its own chief executive, likely to be the current boss, Roger Burnley, who only recently joined Asda from Sainsbury\u2019s. Coupe insisted that the Sainsbury\u2019s brand, which has prided itself on better welfare and food quality standards, would not be damaged by the association with Walmart, an international retail giant best known for its low prices. The deal enables Walmart, which bought Asda nearly 20 years ago, to take a step back from the UK market, where it is struggling to compete with Aldi and Lidl as well as Tesco, which controls almost a third of the grocery market. Judith McKenna, the chief executive of Walmart International, said: \u201cWe believe this combination will create a dynamic new retail player better positioned for even more success in a fast-changing and competitive UK market.\u201d She said Walmart was interested in expanding the Sainsbury\u2019s-owned Argos chain internationally and could help the combined business by introducing new technology and better deals on non-food goods. The biggest shareholder in Sainsbury\u2019s , the Qatar Investment Authority, which holds a 22% stake, announced its intention to support the merger.",

      "bodyText": "The rapid expansion of discounters Aldi and Lidl \u2013 whose share of the grocery market has rocketed from less than 4% a decade ago to nearly 13% today \u2013 has hit all traditional supermarkets. But the industry\u2019s biggest fear is Amazon. Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe has long made clear that his real concern is the online giant, which is now the world\u2019s second biggest company, valued at $740bn compared with Walmart\u2019s $264bn. Coupe admitted that his 2016 acquisition of catalogue store Argos was intended partly as a way to fight off the increasing threat from Amazon. Since that deal Amazon has turned its sights directly onto the grocery business. Last year it paid $13.7bn to take over US grocer Whole Foods Market. More recently it has opened a \u201cshop and go\u201d food store called Amazon Go, where shoppers can pick their goods and walk out, paying online without passing through a check-out. Both of those moves hit the share prices of UK supermarket groups. Amazon also has a deal with Morrisons to provide groceries to UK customers using its Pantry and Prime service. Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s have both been touted as possible Amazon takeover targets, along with Ahold Delhaize in the Netherlands and France\u2019s Carrefour. Terry Hunter, managing director of digital commerce group Astound, described Amazon as the elephant in the room. The proposed Sainsbury-Asda merger, he said, \u201cshows that the two chains feel they will be stronger together as they reposition themselves to combat the growing threat from the low-cost German supermarkets and Amazon\u201d. The UK\u2019s grocers, he added, know Amazon \u201cwill be able to outmanoeuvre them and undercut them every step of the way\u201d. Linking with Asda and its giant parent Walmart would give Sainsbury\u2019s more buying power, to secure better deals with suppliers to compete with Amazon on price. The new Sainsbury-Asda group would also be able to benefit from Walmart\u2019s huge investment in digital innovations, such as a smartphone shopping app and automated parcel pick up machines for online shopping. Walmart has also been searching for a way to fight off Amazon in the US. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, said Walmart is far from confident it can keep Amazon at bay. \u201cIt is hard to believe that a company with $500bn in annual sales has a reason to be frightened of anyone, but Walmart has its competitors too,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods suggests it may be about to start attacking the grocery market ... Only time will tell but Walmart is not waiting to find out.\u201d Walmart International boss Judith McKenna suggested the tie-up with Sainsbury\u2019s could add another weapon to Walmart\u2019s armoury outside the UK. Sainsbury has benefited from putting dozens of Argos outlets into its supermarkets and its fast deliveries, using a network of small stores, could be a more efficient alternative to Amazon\u2019s large centralised warehouses. McKenna said Walmart is now considering using Argos in the US and elsewhere help to fight off Amazon more effectively. For the owner of Asda, Amazon poses a serious threat on both sides of the Atlantic. \u2022This article was amended on 1 May 2018 to remove an incorrect description of Amazon Go stores",

Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, said Walmart is far from confident it can keep Amazon at bay. \u201cIt is hard to believe that a company with $500bn in annual sales has a reason to be frightened of anyone, but Walmart has its competitors too,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods suggests it may be about to start attacking the grocery market ... Only time will tell but Walmart is not waiting to find out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Walmart International boss Judith McKenna suggested the tie-up with Sainsbury\u2019s could add another weapon to Walmart\u2019s armoury outside the UK. Sainsbury has benefited from putting dozens of Argos outlets into its supermarkets and its fast deliveries, using a network of small stores, could be a more efficient alternative to Amazon\u2019s large centralised warehouses. McKenna said Walmart is now considering using Argos in the US and elsewhere help to fight off Amazon more effectively. For the owner of Asda, Amazon poses a serious threat on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> \n<p>\u2022This article was amended on 1 May 2018 to remove an incorrect description of Amazon Go stores</p>",

Joaquin ended up in hospital with eight stitches in his leg, the first time he was hurt. The food delivery industry in Australia is booming, used by a third of adults in capital cities and worth $2.6bn. Three companies are driving the surge: the US-owned UberEats, German-owned Foodora and British-owned Deliveroo. But current and former riders for the companies have told Guardian Australia they have experienced unsafe weather conditions and uncertain insurance cover for work they consider \u201cpoorly paid\u201d, given the instability and conditions. A survey of 160 riders conducted by the Transport Workers Union in January found 50% had been hurt on the job or knew someone who had. Riders spoke of being hit by taxis, \u201cdoored\u201d by cars and of experiencing near misses on a weekly basis. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Riders \u2013 who are taken on as contractors, not employees \u2013 said they received little or no training and their inherently dangerous job was often made worse by the pressure to work in poor weather conditions, when demand for deliveries is highest. Most riders who spoke to Guardian Australia asked for their full name to be withheld. Tom, a former bicycle deliverer for Foodora and UberEats in Sydney, said a storm always meant his Foodora shifts would be extended. In a city-wide WhatsApp groupchat, the company\u2019s dispatch managers used to ask riders to stay out longer every rainy night, he said. \u201cWe used to get group messages saying \u2018Stay safe out there\u2019 and \u2018Put your safety first\u2019,\u201d Tom said. \u201cBut that\u2019s totally at odds with pumping out orders on a rainy night. It means nothing.\u201d Josh Klooger, who worked for Foodora for two years in Melbourne, said the company no longer allowed shift extensions of the kind Tom referred to. \u201cYou can always ask to be clocked off,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people wouldn\u2019t want to to do that because they think they might be looked down upon.\u201d Foodora said: \u201cIn the case of bad weather or weather extremes, warnings are issued to riders to promote safe conduct. If riders experience injury or harm, Foodora addresses each situation with care and complies with appropriate work cover.\u201d Deliveroo said riders were not obliged to work when conditions were bad. \u201cDeliveroo regularly sends out safety alerts to remind riders of road safety or warn of weather conditions,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cThere is absolutely no obligation for riders to work during bad weather conditions.\u201d Klooger was fired by Foodora in March after he refused to grant the company access to a groupchat he had made for riders. An email from Foodora said his contract was being terminated for refusing to comply with a request to return the company\u2019s intellectual property. He is pursuing an unfair dismissal claim with the help of the TWU. Riders said the training they were offered was often inadequate or non-existent. Patrick, Tom and Daniel, who all worked for UberEats, said the company provided the least training. \u201cWith Foodora, I got told to follow a PowerPoint presentation they emailed me,\u201d Tom said. \u201cWith Uber, they just give you the bag. They don\u2019t tell you anything.\u201d \u201cYou walk into the office and you get the job,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cNo training.\u201d An Uber spokeswoman said riders were provided with \u201csafe bike riding tips\u201d, the app \u201coften includes safety information\u201d and riders were \u201cfree to take breaks\u201d during heavy rain. \u201cThe safety of all users of the Uber app is a top priority for Uber ... We have a website with safety tips and we are working on further enhancing the information that is made available to delivery partners on road rules and bike safety.\u201d According to a Foodora spokeswoman and rider contracts, seen by Guardian Australia, Foodora riders are required to do a road safety quiz and are contractually obliged to undertake more advanced tests if Foodora requests. Deliveroo provides new riders with eight safety videos before they begin and the contract requires them to inform the company within 24 hours if they are involved in an accident or near miss. Deliveroo also prohibits workers from driving or riding under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Tony Sheldon, the TWU\u2019s national secretary, said the delivery companies were consistently \u201cfailing to address the concerns of riders\u201d. \u201cThe on-demand economy is a tired example of old-fashioned exploitation at play in modern Australia. It doesn\u2019t involve \u2018gig\u2019 or \u2018sharing\u2019 work but on-demand piece work, which was abolished in Australia in the early 1900s.\u201d If riders do get hurt, figuring out what form of insurance they have, and from whom, is tricky. Many simply do not know what happens if they are hurt on the job. Across the companies, insurance is divided into two categories: for those who deliver by car, and those who deliver by bike. That is then further divided into insurance provided by company or by the worker. For cars, all three companies require deliverers to have their own third-party vehicle insurance, which is a legal requirement to drive a car in New South Wales. For bicycle deliverers, only Deliveroo provides insurance for all riders. They are covered for personal injury on the job, for public liability and for lost earnings while recovering and unable to work. Joaquin, who needed eight stitches in his leg when he was injured on the job, said his entire $1,000 hospital bill was covered by Deliveroo. Workers paid 5% of their income to the company, which covers \u201cadministration fees\u201d and contributes marginally to the cost of insurance, a Deliveroo spokeswoman said. Klooger, who was in charge of inducting new riders for Foodora, said he told them to expect the least. \u201cWhen I was inducting people, I would tell them \u2018Make sure you have your own insurance\u2019 because I don\u2019t think Foodora is going to support you.\u201d Instead, Foodora bicycle riders are required to take out their own insurance by buying a membership of Bicycle NSW. This provides them with personal injury and public liability insurance, at their own cost. Uber does not provide bicycle riders with any insurance, nor does it make them buy their own. An Uber spokeswoman said: \u201cUber\u2019s incident response team is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to respond to reported incidents globally via in-app help. All incidents are assessed on a case-by-case basis.\u201d To become a deliverer by car or motorbike, Uber requires documentation of driver\u2019s license, passport or birth certificate, and insurance. To become a deliverer by bicycle, it only requires passport and birth certificate, and another form of ID. Riders told Guardian Australia their insurance was never checked or mentioned. Pstoka said he had \u201czero idea what would happen if I got hospitalised riding for UberEats. Zero.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The question of housing affordability is dominated by talk of house prices and what the Reserve Bank of Australia will do today when it meets to decide on interest rates. However, the ninth annual Anglicare Rental Affordability Snapshot highlights that for many people living on either the minimum wage or government benefits, the problem of housing is not about buying a home but being able to find an affordable place to rent. Each year Anglicare Australia does a somewhat odd thing to gauge housing affordability \u2013 rather than rely on national data and measurements, it looks at what properties are actually available to rent throughout Australia and compares the price with what people on various incomes would be able to afford. And rather than merely look at national figures, it also looks at regions across the nation. This year, on 24 March, it surveyed 67,365 properties that were listed for rent. Not only did the survey look at the price, it also considered the appropriate size of the property. A household with two adults on the minimum wage and two kids might be able to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Sydney, but it makes little sense to count that as \u201caffordable\u201d, given the size of the property would not be fit for that family\u2019s needs. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday The snapshot focuses on households on the minimum wage and four government income support types \u2013 the parenting payment, aged pension, Newstart and the disability support pension. The news, as it has ever been since it began the snapshot, is not good at all for those trying to survive on government support. Throughout Australia, out of those 67,365 properties listed, only three were affordable or appropriate for a single person on Newstart \u2013 one was in Tasmania, one in far north Queensland and one was a share house in Queanbeyan. Even for a single person on the minimum wage, the rental market is very limited \u2013 just 5.3% of the properties listed across Australia were affordable \u2013 and mostly those properties were outside the metropolitan areas. This highlights the biggest issue with rental affordability (and overall housing affordability) \u2013 where you live greatly affects what you can afford. While, for example, across the nation 4.3% of proprieties listed were affordable and appropriate for a couple on the age pension, in greater Sydney just 34 of the 17,417 properties listed fit this category. The best areas for an age pensioner couple to find a place to rent are the Queensland central region, the New South Wales Riverina and the South Australian south-eastern region. But even here we are taking a wide expanse that includes towns such as Murray Bridge, those in the Riverland and down to Mount Gambier. For a family with a couple on the minimum wage, the best place is Western Australia\u2019s south-west, as well as SA\u2019s south-east and the Queensland central area (which includes towns such as Gladstone and Rockhampton). Not surprisingly, overall affordability is easier for those on the minimum wage than with income support. But the difference across the capital cities is quite wide. In Sydney, just 4.8% of properties are affordable for a household on the minimum wage compared to half of those listed in Perth: A big reason for the disparity is the big difference in rental price growth over the past year. While in Sydney, rent prices have grown by 2.4% in the past year, in Perth \u2013 due to the end of the mining boom \u2013 they have fallen by more than 6%: But even within individual areas the affordability can vary significantly depending on the size of the household and the number of adults on the minimum wage or income support. In Perth, for example, while 50% of the properties were affordable and appropriate for households on the minimum wage, that number dropped significantly when only one adult in the household was on that wage and the other was on income support. Even for a single person on the minimum wage, just 1.4% of properties in Perth\u2019s greater metropolitan area were affordable and appropriate. The big takeaway from the figures is just how much more precarious life becomes when you are alone. Consider that there were 2,983 properties through Australia that were affordable for a couple on the age pension \u2013 a pathetic 4.3% \u2013 but just 833, or 1.2%, for a single pensioner. In either case, it presents a worrying future should housing affordability continue to decline for younger generations once they hit retirement. Overall since last year, the rental affordability picture has become worse, but with some good news in some capital cities. Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane have seen an increase in affordability across a number of household income types \u2013 a function of the increase in apartment supply in Melbourne and Brisbane and falling demand and rental prices in Perth. In Sydney, there was a 0.6% point increase in the number of properties available for a couple on the minimum wage, but no discernible improvement for any other income type. In Adelaide the situation has actually deteriorated for households on the minimum wage: Anglicare argues that currently \u201cthe federal government spends billions more on subsidising wealth accumulation for property investors than it does on public housing and homelessness services\u201d, and that the situation needs to reverse. And certainly public housing construction is much lower now than it was 20 years ago: On Tuesday the Reserve Bank will again decide on interest rates (most likely keeping them at the current record low of 1.5%). Quite often that provokes a discussion on the affordability of buying a home. But the Anglicare snapshot reveals that for the very many people in Australia for whom buying a home is not so much a dream but an impossibility, the daily reality of finding a place to rent is an almighty struggle \u2013 one that is barely improving despite the improving employment picture over the past year. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "body": "<p>The question of housing affordability is dominated by talk of house prices and what the Reserve Bank of Australia will do today when it meets to decide on interest rates. However, the ninth annual <a href=\"http://www.anglicare.asn.au/national-conference/research-reports/the-rental-affordability-snapshot/docs/default-source/default-document-library/final---rental-affordability-snapshotad11d9309d6962baacc1ff0000899bca\">Anglicare Rental Affordability Snapshot</a> highlights that for many people living on either the minimum wage or government benefits, the problem of housing is not about buying a home but being able to find an affordable place to rent. </p> <p>Each year Anglicare Australia does a somewhat odd thing to gauge housing affordability \u2013 rather than rely on national data and measurements, it looks at what properties are actually available to rent throughout Australia and compares the price with what people on various incomes would be able to afford. And rather than merely look at national figures, it also looks at regions across the nation. </p> <p>This year, on 24 March, it surveyed 67,365 properties that were listed for rent. Not only did the survey look at the price, it also considered the appropriate size of the property. A household with two adults on the minimum wage and two kids might be able to afford a one-bedroom apartment in Sydney, but it makes little sense to count that as \u201caffordable\u201d, given the size of the property would not be fit for that family\u2019s needs.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/dec/04/best-of-comment-is-free-australia-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4160\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for the best of Guardian Australia opinion\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email of editors' picks\" data-form-campaign-code=\"AU_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up.\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The snapshot focuses on households on the minimum wage and four government income support types \u2013 the parenting payment, aged pension, Newstart and the disability support pension. </p> <p>The news, as it has ever been since it began the snapshot, is not good at all for those trying to survive on government support.</p> <p>Throughout Australia, out of those 67,365 properties listed, only three were affordable or appropriate for a single person on Newstart \u2013 one was in Tasmania, one in far north Queensland and one was a share house in Queanbeyan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Number and proportion of suitable property listings\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/AgRNg/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"796\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Even for a single person on the minimum wage, the rental market is very limited \u2013 just 5.3% of the properties listed across Australia were affordable \u2013 and mostly those properties were outside the metropolitan areas. </p> <p>This highlights the biggest issue with rental affordability (and overall housing affordability) \u2013 where you live greatly affects what you can afford.</p> <p>While, for example, across the nation 4.3% of proprieties listed were affordable and appropriate for a couple on the age pension, in greater Sydney just 34 of the 17,417 properties listed fit this category. </p> <p>The best areas for an age pensioner couple to find a place to rent are the Queensland central region, the New South Wales Riverina and the South Australian south-eastern region. But even here we are taking a wide expanse that includes towns such as Murray Bridge, those in the Riverland and down to Mount Gambier. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Rental affordability by region and household type\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/G97Di/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>For a family with a couple on the minimum wage, the best place is Western Australia\u2019s south-west, as well as SA\u2019s south-east and the Queensland central area (which includes towns such as Gladstone and Rockhampton).</p> <p>Not surprisingly, overall affordability is easier for those on the minimum wage than with income support. But the difference across the capital cities is quite wide. </p> <p>In Sydney, just 4.8% of properties are affordable for a household on the minimum wage compared to half of those listed in Perth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Affordable &amp; appropriate properties by household income type\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fEtJ4/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A big reason for the disparity is the big difference in rental price growth over the past year. While in Sydney, rent prices have grown by 2.4% in the past year, in Perth \u2013 due to the end of the mining boom \u2013 they have fallen by more than 6%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Rent price growth by capital city\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4mi5N/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But even within individual areas the affordability can vary significantly depending on the size of the household and the number of adults on the minimum wage or income support. </p> <p>In Perth, for example, while 50% of the properties were affordable and appropriate for households on the minimum wage, that number dropped significantly when only one adult in the household was on that wage and the other was on income support. Even for a single person on the minimum wage, just 1.4% of properties in Perth\u2019s greater metropolitan area were affordable and appropriate. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Rental affordability by region and household type\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4WFJk/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big takeaway from the figures is just how much more precarious life becomes when you are alone. Consider that there were 2,983 properties through Australia that were affordable for a couple on the age pension \u2013 a pathetic 4.3% \u2013 but just 833, or 1.2%, for a single pensioner. </p> <p>In either case, it presents a worrying future should housing affordability continue to decline for younger generations once they hit retirement.</p> <p>Overall since last year, the rental affordability picture has become worse, but with some good news in some capital cities. </p> <p>Perth, Melbourne and Brisbane have seen an increase in affordability across a number of household income types \u2013 a function of the increase in apartment supply in Melbourne and Brisbane and falling demand and rental prices in Perth. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/mar/06/australian-housing-stuck-between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place\">Australian housing stuck between a rock and a hard place | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Sydney, there was a 0.6% point increase in the number of properties available for a couple on the minimum wage, but no discernible improvement for any other income type.

      "bodyText": "The embattled TSB chief executive is to face intense questioning from MPs as the bank stumbled into its second week of chaos following its catastrophic IT failure. Paul Pester, along with the bank\u2019s chair Richard Meddings and a representative from Spanish parent group Sabadell, will be hauled in front of the Treasury committee on Wednesday to explain how TSB\u2019s IT systems collapsed more than a week ago, and how they will compensate affected customers. Committee chair and Conservative MP Nicky Morgan said: \u201cWe will take evidence from TSB and Sabadell representatives to find out how they got into this mess, who is responsible, and how they are putting it right.\u201d The botched IT transfer from TSB\u2019s former owner Lloyds to Banco de Sabadell was designed to reap cost savings of \u00a3100m a year but Pester admitted last week that the bank was \u201con our knees\u201d. TSB said on Monday its online banking services were \u201cavailable again but some customers may still have difficulties accessing and using these services\u201d. A week after problems first emerged, TSB\u2019s online services continued running significantly below capacity, with some customers reporting they were still blocked from their accounts. All TSB mortgage customers have been prevented from viewing any details of their account online for more than a week. The committee hearing is likely to focus on what TSB will do to compensate customers and if Pester will still receive a bonus. Morgan said: \u201cThe Treasury committee is extremely concerned by the problems at TSB, and by the apparent miscommunication to customers about the extent and nature of these problems.\u201d Pester has until now refused to answer questions about his \u00a31.6m bonus, which was due to be paid once the IT migration is complete, along with bonuses for 30 other senior managers. In a letter to Morgan released ahead of the hearing, Pester admitted that on the first day of the IT chaos on Monday last week: \u201cWe were only able to serve c.200,000 sessions via our website versus an expected level of c.450,000.\u201d Pester also admitted that as customers tried to ring the bank instead, \u201caverage wait times were close to one hour; by Thursday this had remained high at approximately 30 minutes\u201d. TSB admitted that only six in 10 of its branches had technology that was fully functioning even by the end of the week. Pester\u2019s letter said the \u201cissues started to occur after TSB\u2019s migration onto a new platform built for TSB by our parent company, Sabadell, and operated by Sabadell\u2019s technology subsidiary, Sabis\u201d. But the banking software at the heart of TSB\u2019s troubles was doomed to failure from the start, an insider with extensive knowledge of the systems involved told the Guardian last week. TSB has promised to repay customers left out of pocket. \u201cI want to reassure the committee that we are working around the clock to put things right for our customers,\u201d Pester wrote in his letter to Morgan. \u201cAs I have said publicly, no customer will be out of pocket as a consequence of these problems.\u201d Tuesday will be another crucial test for the bank\u2019s IT, with the first day of the month a popular time for monthly salary payments, direct debits and standing orders. TSB insisted that \u201cfundamental record keeping and account management functions within the platform are working as designed. This means that the fundamental components of the bank, such as regular payments, debit cards, credit cards, and ATMs, are all working as normal\u201d. However, Twitter users continued to post images of their accounts which show payment instructions dated 2099. Fraudsters have also tried to cash in on the IT meltdown, prompting the bank to warn customers to be wary of emails and tweets claiming to be from TSB.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Sainsbury\u2019s is on track to become Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket after agreeing a deal with Asda\u2019s owner, Walmart. Under the deal, Walmart will own 42% of the combined company, which will control around a third of supermarket revenues. The two companies have agreed that prices could fall by up to 10% on some popular items if the deal is approved. They have also pledged not to close stores or lay off store staff - however, analysts believe some stores will be sold off to rivals. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: The merger of the UK\u2019s second and third largest retailers is expected to trigger a major inquiry which analysts predict will result in at least 75 stores having to be disposed of. It would be the biggest shake-up in the market since the merger of Morrison and Safeway in 2003 when dozens of stores changed hands. Sainsbury\u2019s takeover of Asda is not expected to complete until the second half of next year as regulators crunch the numbers on potential overlap between the two groups\u2019 stores. Mike Coupe, the Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive who plans to lead the merged business, said the deal was a \u201ctransformational opportunity to create a new force in UK retail, which will be more competitive and give customers more of what they want now and in the future\u201d. Shares in Sainsbury\u2019s have surged 15% today, closing at their highest level since the summer of 2014. MPs have warned that the deal could cost jobs, hurt competition, and lead to store closures - despite Sainsbury and Asda\u2019s promises. Labour are calling for an full, urgent probe into the deal. Government minister Andrew Griffiths, though, has argued that the retail sector is going through tough times - and that Sainsbury and Asda are trying to get ahead of the curve. In banking, TSB customers are still struggling to access their accounts after more than a week of disruption. Lloyds Bank has also suffered from IT gremlins today, with some users unable to get its app to work. The Treasury Committee has announced that it will question TSB\u2019s chief, Paul Pester, on Wednesday. That\u2019s all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Back in the City, shares in Sainsbury have closed 15% higher, as traders welcome its proposed takeover of Asda. That adds some \u00a3858m to Sainsbury\u2019s market capitalisation, pushing it up to \u00a36.78bn. Asked again about the future of stores, minister Andrew Griffiths repeats that Sainsbury and Asda are pledging that no stores will close, and no jobs within stores will be lost. But Labour MP Justin Madders isn\u2019t convinced - he says workers will pay the price of the \u00a3500m of efficiency savings planned under the deal. Q: Attacks on terms and conditions are inevitable; what will the minister do in two years when that has happened? Griffiths replies that his powers were laid out in the Enterprise Act 2002 -- the decision on whether to allow the deal now rests with the CMA. And that\u2019s the end of the urgent question. Jack Dromey MP, a former top official at the Unite union, tells the House that supermarkets are powerful, as employers and across their supply chains. They must not be allowed to abuse that power, Dromey tells fellow MPs. Does the minister understand the \u201cdismay\u201d among employees about this deal, which came \u201cout of the blue\u201d at the weekend. Dromey accuses Griffiths of \u2018waxing lyrical\u2019 about Sainsbury and Asda\u2019s promises (for example...); will he act to ensure that these are not just Day One guarantees, but can be counted on in years to come? Griffiths replies that it is \u2018early days\u2019, and points out that the current government brought in the Groceries Code Adjudicator to protect farmers and other suppliers. Q: How long will workers and customers face uncertainty over this deal, and what impact will this have on portfolio investment? Andrew Griffiths says that Sainsbury and Asda hope the CMA will hold a \u2018fast-track\u2019 review. If that happens, then the detailed Phase 2 investigation could be completed in six months. Labour MP Susan Elan Jones asks a straight question -- does the minister think this is a good deal or a bad deal for British farming? But she doesn\u2019t get a straight answer. Minister Andrew Griffiths says the deal must be considered by the shareholders of Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s \u2013 so it\u2019s not appropriate for the government to pass judgement. Labour\u2019s Chris Matheson is also worried that jobs will be lost among the distribution chain that serve Sainsbury and Asda stores today. Matheson points out that many distribution centres were sighted to replace lost manufacturing jobs; what guarantees can the government give to those \u201cdifficult areas\u201d? Andrew Griffiths says his constituency, Burton, contains some distribution jobs (it\u2019s in the middle of the country). However, he makes two points: First of all... the number of supermarkets served will be the same if the deal goes through, so the number of lorries and goods will be the same Second, the issue of job losses is not one that the government can consider under the Enterprise Act. Philip Hollobone, Conservative MP for Kettering, says his constituency currently has a large Sainsbury\u2019s and a large Asda. Workers and shoppers want to know - will we still have both stores in two years time? In reply, minister Andrew Griffiths says that Kettering shoppers and workers want to know they have choice and competition, and that those jobs are protected. If they are both \u201cthriving supermarkets\u201d, either the CMA will decide there isn\u2019t a competition issue and allow the combined company to keep running both, or it will say there are competition issues, and one will be sold, Griffiths explains. Conservative MP Stephen Kerr says the concentration of supermarket power could have a \u201cpotentially devastating effect\u201d on suppliers. Will their voices be heard? Griffiths replies that suppliers will be included in the CMA\u2019s investigation. The CMA will consider what happens in constituencies where there currently Sainsbury and Asda stores close together, Andrew Griffiths says. If they believe it will be anti-competitive for both supermarkets to be there, they will force a sale to a competitor. Conservative MP Mark Menzies says he worked in Asda\u2019s head office for 11 years. He doesn\u2019t believe \u201cthat place\u201d will be there in a few years, so there\u2019s no point the government trying to make promises about jobs. Menzies also criticises the government for calling the deal a merger - it\u2019s a takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s, he insists, so \u201clets stop using false terminology\u201d. Finally, Menzies urges the government to protect workers in distribution centres across the country; otherwise, they will be \u201cabsolutely hammered\u201d if this deal goes ahead. In response, Andrew Griffiths says it is a merger legally. There will be efficiency savings, he says, but Sainsbury and Asda have assured the government that they will continue to operate as different businesses. Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves says workers at Asda\u2019s headquarters in Leeds (in her constituency) will be \u2018incredibly concerned about their future\u2019 given the lack of assurances about jobs. Q: The industrial strategy is about rebalancing the economy away from London - what assurances can the government give that this deal won\u2019t rebalance jobs away from Yorkshire? Business minister Andrew Griffiths points out that many high street names have been lost in recent years, due to the changing retail climate [ie, competition from Amazon] Today\u2019s deal shows \u201ctwo businesses trying to get ahead of the curve and future-proof themselves in a vey challenging market\u201d he adds. That\u2019s quite an endorsement from the government bench - Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda must be delighted. Labour MP Hilary Benn asks whether jobs are at risk at Sainsbury\u2019s headquarters. Minister Andrew Griffiths says he doesn\u2019t yet have any reassurances, beyond the promise that both company\u2019s HQs will be kept open. Conservative MP Robert Halfon suggests that Sainsbury\u2019s could break its commitment not to eliminate store workers, once the merger has gone through. Griffiths encourages Halfon to engage with the CMA and both companies over his concerns. Conservative MP Andrew Selous says his Dunstable constituency has an Asda and a Sainsbury\u2019s close to each other, with a clutch of other supermarket outlets - and an Amazon fulfillment centre - close by. What might the Competition and Markets Authority think about this situation? The honourable member is spoiled for choice, minister Andrew Griffiths replies. Over in parliament, the government is facing an urgent question on the Sainsbury-Asda deal. Labour\u2019s Rebecca Long Bailey is putting the question now, asking whether the deal will lead to job cuts. She also warns that the merger will \u201cradically alter the whole grocery sector\u201d, affecting suppliers and farmers as well as customers and staff. The government urgently needs to needs to broaden out the public interest test applied to takeover teals, Long Bailey says, to protect these people. Business minister Andrew Griffiths responds, saying he has spoken to the CEOs of Sainsbury and Asda this morning, and told them that it was important to treat suppliers fairly. Griffiths tells the House that he told the companies the important of engaging with the unions..... and that he had received assurances that both head offices will remain open. But... Griffiths also points out that the retail sector is in a period of huge flux - the way people are shopping is changing fast, so retailers must change and adapt. Griffiths also cited Sainsbury\u2019s claim that prices will be cut, by up to 10% for popular items. Retail analyst Mark Brumby has a few thoughts on the Sainsbury-Asda deal: You can usually rely on the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist for an eye-catching speech with a few choice quotes. And today, Andy Haldane has argued that music streaming site Spotify and online game World Of Warcraft can teach economists a few lessons on how to handle data. To be honest, Haldane actually made these comments more than a week ago, to King\u2019s College Business School. But the Bank of England has only just released the text, so they\u2019re worth looking at now. Haldane\u2019s theme is \u201cBig Data\u201d, and the way that central bankers can use the explosion of data in recent years to get a better picture of the economy\u2019s moving parts. He says that a major breakthrough is close: In time, it is possible these sorts of data could help to create a real-time map of financial and activity flows across the economy, in much the same way as is already done for flows of traffic or information or weather. Once mapped, there would then be scope to model and, through policy, modify these flows. This is an idea I first talked about six years ago. Today, it looks closer than ever to being within our grasp. Haldane argued that behavioural economists could explore \u201cnon-traditional means\u201d when trying to forecast how people will behave.... To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people\u2019s sentiment. Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence. And why stop at music? People\u2019s tastes in books, TV and radio may also offer a window on their soul. So too might their taste in games. Indeed, I am interested in the potential for using gaming techniques, not just to extract data on people\u2019s preferences, but as a means of generating data on preferences and actions. Haldane also suggests that today\u2019s massive multiplayer online games could work as a sandbox for economists to examine behaviour -- to aid forecasting the next time there\u2019s a crisis. A gaming environment could be used to understand behaviour in a way which placed fewer restrictions. People\u2019s behaviour would be observed directly in the act of game-playing which, provided this behaviour was a reasonable reflection of true behaviour, would give us new data. Because this is a virtual rather than real world, with shocks controlled and regulated, that could make it easier to address issues of causality and identification in response to shocks, including policy shocks. There are already multi-person games with primitive economies attached to them, which allow goods and monies to change hands between participants. These include EVE Online and World of Warcraft. The speech is online here. The Press Association have published a Q&amp;A on the Sainsbury-Asda deal. Q: What will it mean for shop prices? The two supermarket giants have pledged to invest the cost efficiencies generated from the merger into lower prices. Sainsbury\u2019s expects to save \u00a3500m from merging with Asda, and has said it will lower shop prices by 10% on everyday products. However, this could have more widespread implications for shop prices if discounters Aldi and Lidl decide to cut their prices even further to stay ahead of their main-market rivals. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe executives of other supermarkets will have their heads in their hands at the prospect of another price war.\u201d Q: What will it mean for stores? The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will soon start its investigation of the proposed merger, raising the prospect that Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda will be forced to sell off stores if they directly compete in local areas. However, Sainsbury\u2019s insisted on Monday that it does not expect to shut any stores. The supermarket says its store footprint is more focused on the south, and Asda has more stores in the north. Q: What will happen to Argos? Sainsbury\u2019s bought Argos in 2016 and already has more than 200 Argos outlets within its supermarkets, having rapidly expanded over the past year. It is expected that Argos will now start appearing in Asda\u2019s stores, with Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive Mike Coupe saying this morning that the deal \u201cbrings scale in clothing and general merchandise\u201d. Q: Why are the two companies joining forces now? All retailers are having to take drastic action to stay competitive during a critical time for the sector. With Amazon eyeing up the UK food market with its Amazon Fresh delivery service, food retailers will be nervous about its sprawling logistics network and buying power. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda also have to fend off price competition from Aldi and Lidl. As a value supermarket, Asda has been under significant pressure as the German discounters have grown their market share. Tesco\u2019s recent merger with wholesaler Booker Group, which was cleared with minimal fuss by the CMA, will also have given executives at Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda confidence about the possibility of joining forces. TSB chief Paul Pester has warmed up for his looming parliamentary grilling by updating MPs about the bank\u2019s IT crisis. He\u2019s written to Nicky Morgan MP, answering her questions about the technology failings. Pester says the TSB have launched a \u201cproactive customer redress programme\u201d, to meet his pledge that no customers are left out of pocket. He also claims that TSB has made significant progress in bring its internet banking and mobile app back into use, saying On Monday 23rd April we were only able to serve c.200,000 sessions via our website versus an expected level of c.450,000. As of Thursday 26th April, we were able to serve c.450,000. This is consistent with the number of sessions we would expect to serve. On Monday 23rd April approximately 72% of customers attempting to access the mobile app were successful on first attempt. As of Friday 27th April this had risen to approximately 93%. This is typical of the proportion we would have seen pre-migration. Pester also confirms that more than 400 customers saw another customer\u2019s account details - because the two accounts were linked: TSB, like many other banks, enable customers to nominate a third party to have access to their accounts - these are called nominee accounts. Typically this will be a parent having access to a child\u2019s account or a grown-up child managing an ageing parent\u2019s account. The ability for the third party to see the customer\u2019s account information is usually limited to branch and telephony channels. However, on the evening of Sunday 22nd April access was provided via digital channels. In addition, as well as enabling the third party to see the customer\u2019s data, the customer was able to see the third party\u2019s data. Therefore, in the \u201cparent and child\u201d example, the parent could see the child\u2019s transaction data but the child could also see the parent\u2019s transaction data. This explains some of the comments in social media where customers expecting to be overdrawn (the \u201cchild\u201d) could see large credit balances (the \u201cparent\u201d). No personal data was visible, just account balance data. Finally, Pester also admits that customers faced an average wait of one hour if they tried to phone TSB a week ago; by Thursday, this had dropped to 30 minutes (although some customers have reported much longer waits). The full letter is online here. Get the popcorn in! Britain\u2019s Treasury Committee will be grilling Paul Pester, TSB\u2019s chief executive, and the bank\u2019s chairman Richard Meddings, on Wednesday. The committee will demand answers about exactly how TSB\u2019s IT systems collapsed more than a week ago, and how they will compensate affected customers. Committee chair Nicky Morgan MP says: \u201cThe Treasury Committee is extremely concerned by the problems at TSB, and by the apparent miscommunication to customers about the extent and nature of these problems. \u201cIt\u2019s been reported that services such as online banking have been down for some TSB customers for over a week. Many individuals and businesses will have made arrangements for the planned outage, but not for the additional time that the systems have been unavailable. \u201cWe will take evidence from TSB and Sabadell representatives to find out how they got into this mess, who is responsible, and how they are putting it right.\u201d Just in: The Labour Party are calling for an urgent investigation into the Sainsbury-Asda merger. Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, says the deal has \u201csignificant competition risks\u201d, and the Competition and Markets Authorities must take a proper look (ie, a phase 2 investigation) Long Bailey says the CMA must secure \u201cconcrete assurances.\u201d to protect workers and suppliers. \u201cThere are risks to jobs by potential reorganisation and store closures and risks to the wider grocery industry as a Tesco/Sainsbury\u2019s-Asda duopoly emerges with unrivalled power to dominate, dictating choice and prices for consumers which in time may prove detrimental. \u201cThis unrivalled power also poses immense risk to suppliers with unprecedented bargaining power to drive suppliers prices and payment terms down which could cause instability and damage to the food and grocery manufacturing industry. The IT crisis at TSB Bank has dragged into its second week. Some customers are still unable to get into their accounts, 10 days after TSB tried to migrate to a new technology platform. Experts from IBM have been working at TSB since last Thursday, to try to get its Internet banking and mobile app online. But clearly the \u2018meltdown\u2019 isn\u2019t over, given these tweets from UK businesses and retail customers: Alarmingly, TSB isn\u2019t the only bank facing complaints today. Lloyds Bank (which spun out TSB in 2013) has suffered \u2018intermittent\u2019 problems this morning. Its Halifax division is also caught up in the outage, as these tweets show: News of Sainsbury\u2019s tie-up with Asda has driven Britain\u2019s stock market to its highest level since the start of February. The FTSE 100 has gained 37 points, or 0.5%, to 7539 this morning. Sainsbury\u2019s is leading the way, up 17% at a four-year high right now. Advertising giant WPP is close behind, gaining 8% after reporting better-than-expected results this morning, and saying it could sell some assets. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Sainsbury\u2019s shares are up 15% after the company announced plans to merge with Asda. The move is subject to regulatory approval, but should it go ahead it would be worth \u00a37.3 billion. Increased competition from Aldi and Lidl is main motivation behind the proposed deal. The deep-discounters have disrupted the UK supermarket sector severely, and now have a combined market share of approximately 12%. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda are the second and third-largest supermarkets by market share, and should the deal go ahead, it would put them in first place. Sainsbury\u2019s predict it will save \u00a3500 million through synergies. The retailer also updated the market with its full-year figures, as underlying pre-tax profits rose by 1.4% to \u00a3589 million, which was comfortably ahead of the \u00a3559 million expected. WPP shares are in demand this morning after it released better-than-expected sales figures, while the advertising giant also stated a strategic review was underway. First-quarter net sales dropped by 0.1%, while analysts had expected a decline of 1%. The company also said it would take a \u2018fresh look\u2019 at business in light of Sir Martin Sorrell stepping down earlier this month. There is talk WPP could spin off assets, but nothing has been confirmed, and no timeline has been stated. Simran Jagdev, companies analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says Sainsbury\u2019s decision to tie-up with Asda is a surprise, partly prompted by the threat of Amazon: The deal points to the highly competitive UK grocery market, which has long been concentrated in the hands of the top four players\u2014 Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda, Morrisons - but is now facing an onslaught from new challengers. Sainsbury\u2019s seems to be continuing the offensive against online players such as Amazon and discount grocery retailers such as Aldi and Lidl that Tesco started last year with its merger with Booker. The deal will help Sainsbury fend off this new competition. It will also mark Walmart\u2019s operational exit from the UK, as part of its strategic decisions to instead work through partnerships in international markets. Amisha Chohan, equity research analyst at Quilter Cheviot, says the deal is a \u201cmasterstroke\u201d - as long as the CMA approve it. It would result in the company becoming the biggest grocer in the UK, ahead of Tesco. Its guided net synergies of over \u00a3500m seem prudent and we believe it could be significantly in excess of this. Sainsbury\u2019s experience from the Argos acquisition should enable it to deliver ahead of the synergy guidance. Although this news is not ideal for Tesco, we remain positive on the UK\u2019s current largest retailer due its recent takeover of Booker, and the wholesale opportunities this will bring.\u201d Paul Mumford of Cavendish Asset Management believes Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda will be forced to sell some stores to get this deal \u201cthrough the hoop\u201d: Store disposals could naturally be offered to others in the sector with M+S and Morrisons being the most likely tenants, but it\u2019s hardly the best climate to be a net seller of large retail space. There will of course be some management synergies too, so a proclamation of no job cuts will no doubt be reversed soon enough. This will obviously create a mighty force. But the big questions now are what influence will Walmart have on the group? And where does this leave other players? Sainsburys already has a big challenge to show that the Argos acquisition is bearing fruit, and now it\u2019s faced with driving cost synergies from Asda. The indicated 10% lower prices on regularly bought products will have raised eyebrows amongst the food producers who will fear another squeeze on margins. Britain\u2019s competition watchdog have confirmed they are likely to review the Sainsbury-Asda deal. In a statement, the Competition and Markets Authority says: This merger is likely to be subject to review by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA adds that it will assess whether the merger is bad for customers. During a Phase 1 review, the CMA would assess whether the deal could reduce competition and choice for shoppers. After this first phase, the merger could be cleared or, if a potential reduction in competition is identified, it would be referred for an in-depth, Phase 2 investigation lasting up to 24 weeks - unless the merging parties offered immediate proposals to address any competition concerns identified. The surge in Sainsbury\u2019s shares this morning is a blow to speculators who have been betting against the supermarket. Some major hedge funds have been \u2018shorting\u2019 Sainsbury\u2019s shares recently, by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back cheaper in future. That bet seems to be unravelling, as Sainsbury\u2019s shares hit their highest level in almost four years. As The Times explained this morning: A little over a tenth of Sainsbury\u2019s shares were being shorted going into the weekend, with investors betting on a drop in the supermarket\u2019s share price. Large London-based hedge funds such as Odey Asset Management, GLG and Marshall Wace have short positions in Sainsbury\u2019s amid investor anxiety about the future facing traditional retailers. Andy Brian, head of retail at Gordons law firm, also believes store closure are inevitable if this deal isn\u2019t blocked by the competition authorities: \u201cOne thing is clear; despite what is being said officially, stores would have to close. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing for the brands, although it would of course be a bad thing for those store employees. Moving forwards, one theory is that this deal could allow Sainsbury\u2019s the freedom to compete hard against M&amp;S Food and Waitrose at the top end of the grocery market and leave Asda to compete further on price against the other mid-market players, as well as Aldi and Lidl. Research group Edison have estimated that around 70 Asda stores could be vulnerable to sale or closure, as they\u2019re rather close to a Sainsbury\u2019s outlet. The Federation of Small Businesses is concerned that small suppliers will be treated roughly if Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda are allowed to form a new retail titan. FSB chairman Mike Cherry says regulators must demand firm commitments before green-lighting the deal, as Sainsbury is already talking about \u00a3500m of cost savings and a boost to earnings. \u201cA merger of this size will concentrate a lot of power in the hands of one giant company, and it\u2019s important that power isn\u2019t misused to coerce small suppliers into accepting unfair contracts and poor payment terms. \u201cThose at the top of Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda should explain how they plan to merge these two supply chains fairly, and give reassurance that cost savings won\u2019t be achieved simply by milking their small suppliers for all they\u2019re worth. \u201cWhen investigating this proposed merger, the Competition and Markets Authority should be looking for cast-iron commitments that a positive standard will be set for working with smaller suppliers. Data firm Allies has created an interactive map, showing exactly where Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda\u2019s stores are today. It also shows Argos outlets (Sainsbury\u2019s acquired Argos in 2016), so it gives a good idea of where there might be competition issues. Here are the vital statistics about today\u2019s merger - showing how a combined Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda will leap-frog Tesco: Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, Mike Coupe, has been speaking to journalists. He says he\u2019s 100% confident that stores won\u2019t need to close following the merger with Asda. However, the regulators may insist that some stores are sold off. There are scores of places where Sainsbury and Asda stores are close by, giving the combined company a dominant position. Britain\u2019s unions are demanding guarantees for workers at Asda. Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB, fears that staff at the supermarket will pay the price as Sainsbury pursues the \u00a3500m of cost savings promised this morning: \u201cHundreds of thousands of workers stand to be affected, and all know such announcements tend to be followed by management speak like \u2018rationalisation\u2019 in the name of \u2018efficiency\u2019. What that usually means is job losses or cuts to pay, terms and conditions which would be wholly unacceptable. Not least because ASDA workers have already voluntarily agreed to change their contracts to be more flexible in order to play their part and help their employer be more profitable.\u201d \u201cIt is quite right to be asking now in whose interests this proposed merger is being tabled. Is it workers and customers or the shareholders and speculators not happy with the hundreds of millions they already make in a year?\u201d Roache is also unhappy that the deal leaked over the weekend, leaving staff worried about their future: \u201cImagine turning up to your Saturday afternoon shifts only to learn this news, with no word from your employer at all - just speculation in the media. Our members are concerned for their futures and angry they\u2019ve been kept in the dark.\u201d \u201cASDA is hugely profitable supermarket, posting hundreds of millions in profit and backed by hundreds of billions from their US parent company, Walmart. Asda\u2019s success has been built on the back of its workers and it is they who now need and deserve answers and reassurances about their futures - that\u2019s the least they deserve, and the very least their union will be demanding.\u201d This deal will lead to job cuts and a painful squeeze on suppliers, warns John Colley, professor at Warwick Business School. Colley predicts that staff will be \u201crationalised\u201d (ie, laid off) at Sainsbury and Asda\u2019s headquarters, in their regional management, and in their distribution operations. \u201cUltimately there has to be job losses and the suppliers will have to pay through lower prices for the larger volumes they may see. Customers will see reduced choice and the current price war is likely to persist. Colley also expects some stores will be sold off to rivals, although the largest supermarkets may not be in demand, and could close instead. He also warns that the task of completing the deal could be a \u201csignificant distraction\u201d for both companies. This will not entirely be bad news for the competitors who should make share gains as a consequence.\u201d Richard Lim, chief executive, Retail Economics says this deal would create a powerful new competitor: The combined retail group would create significant scale. It would enable better buying terms, the integration of Argos within Asda and drive operating efficiencies expected to deliver cost-savings of at least \u00a3500 million. \u201cIf given the green light by the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority], it would be a game changer in the industry. The potential tie-up could deliver price reductions across a range of products, putting it in a position to challenge Tesco and the discounters head-on. That\u2019s why Sainsbury\u2019s shares are going like a rocket this morning, while Tesco is under the cosh. Boom! J Sainsbury\u2019s shares have jumped by 20% at the start of trading, to their highest level since 2014. That\u2019s a huge move, suggesting that the City believes Sainsbury\u2019s is getting an excellent deal -- as long as regulators don\u2019t block the merger with Asda, of course. Shares in rival supermarkets are falling in early trading. Morrisons, currently Britain\u2019s 4th largest supermarket, are down 3% at the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. Tesco is close behind, down 2.5%. Labour MP Barry Sheerman is concerned that this deal will damage competition: Graham Hiscott of the Daily Mirror says the promise of big price cuts will rock the retail sector: Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, reckons the deal is a win-win for Sainsbury and Walmart (which acquired Asda almost 20 years ago) City traders like the sound of this deal.... there\u2019s chatter that Sainsbury\u2019s shares will jump once the stock market opens at 8am. Asda\u2019s CEO, Roger Burnley, is also dangling the promise of price cuts, once his business has been folded into Sainsbury\u2019s: \u201cThe combination of Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s into a single retailing group will be great news for Asda customers, allowing us to deliver even lower prices in store and even greater choice. Asda will continue to be Asda, but by coming together with Sainsbury\u2019s, supported by Walmart, we can further accelerate our existing strategy and make our offer even more compelling and competitive. The PR war is already underway, with Sainsbury\u2019s chairman David Tyler arguing that the deal is good for the UK: As one of the largest employers in the country, the combined business will become an even greater contributor to the British economy. The proposal will bring together two of the most experienced and talented management teams in retail at a time when the industry is undergoing rapid change. We welcome Walmart as a significant shareholder and look forward to working closely with them.\u201d A few more key points: The combined company will own more than 2,800 stores (Sainsbury, Asda and Argos), and several of the UK\u2019s most visited retail websites Sainsbury claims the deal will \u201cdeliver substantial value creation\u201d for its shareholders. It estimates that earnings per share will grow by \u201cdouble digits\u201d in the second year after the deal goes through. Asda will continue to be run from Leeds with its own CEO (Roger Burnley), who will join the board of the combined business This deal will deliver cost savings of around \u00a3500m per year, Sainsbury\u2019s estimates. That will fuel concerns that jobs will be lost, and suppliers will be squeezed hard. However the company claims that that there are no plans to close stores. Instead, it estimate that \u201cbuying benefits, opening Argos in Asda stores and operational efficiencies\u201d will all cut costs. Sainsbury and Asda are promising to cut prices on popular products by up to 10%, if their merger goes through. They claim the deal will: ...enable investment in areas that will benefit customers the most: price, quality, range and creating more flexible ways to shop in stores and through digital channels, across Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Argos. We expect to lower prices by around 10% on many of the products customers buy regularly. That\u2019s a very bold commitment; good news for customers, but a real headache for rival retailers. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The big news this morning is that supermarket chains Sainsbury and Asda have just agreed to merge, in the biggest shake-up of Britain\u2019s retail sector in years. The deal will create Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket chain - leapfrogging Tesco - with combined revenues of around \u00a351bn. In a statement released to the City, the two companies claim the merger will be \u201ca great deal\u201d for customers, staff, suppliers and shareholders of both businesses. The retail sector is going through significant and rapid change, as customer shopping habits continue to evolve. This has led to increased competition across grocery, general merchandise and clothing, as customers seek ever greater value, choice and convenience. Bringing Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda together will result in a more competitive and more resilient business that will be better able to invest in price, quality, range and the technology to create more flexible ways for customers to shop. However...it\u2019s likely that suppliers will be worried that they could be squeezed by such a powerful new player. Staff, too, will have a lot of questions -- both in the stores, and in the back-offices and HQs. Regulators will also have questions about whether the merger is in customers\u2019 best interests. Although it\u2019s billed as a merger, Sainsbury\u2019s is in the box seat. The deal values Asda at roughly \u00a37.3bn, and Walmart (Asda\u2019s current owner) will end up owning 42% of the combined business. Walmart are also receiving \u00a32.975bn in cash as part of the deal. More details and reaction to follow.... Also coming up today We\u2019ll keep an eye on TSB\u2019s ongoing IT problems, as some customers report that they still can\u2019t get into their online banking accounts.

But the Bank of England has only just released the text, so they\u2019re worth looking at now.</p> <p>Haldane\u2019s theme is \u201cBig Data\u201d, and the way that central bankers can use the explosion of data in recent years to get a better picture of the economy\u2019s moving parts.</p> <p>He says that a major breakthrough is close:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In time, it is possible these sorts of data could help to create a real-time map of financial and activity flows across the economy, in much the same way as is already done for flows of traffic or information or weather.</p> <p>Once mapped, there would then be scope to model and, through policy, modify these flows. This is an idea I first talked about six years ago. Today, it looks closer than ever to being within our grasp.</p> </blockquote> <p>Haldane argued that behavioural economists could explore \u201cnon-traditional means\u201d when trying to forecast how people will behave....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To give one recent example, data on music downloads from Spotify has been used, in tandem with semantic search techniques applied to the words of songs, to provide an indicator of people\u2019s sentiment. Intriguingly, the resulting index of sentiment does at least as well in tracking consumer spending as the Michigan survey of consumer confidence.</p> <p>And why stop at music? People\u2019s tastes in books, TV and radio may also offer a window on their soul. So too might their taste in games. Indeed, I am interested in the potential for using gaming techniques, not just to extract data on people\u2019s preferences, but as a means of generating data on preferences and actions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Haldane</strong> also suggests that today\u2019s massive multiplayer online games could work as a sandbox for economists to examine behaviour -- to aid forecasting the next time there\u2019s a crisis.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A gaming environment could be used to understand behaviour in a way which placed fewer restrictions. People\u2019s behaviour would be observed directly in the act of game-playing which, provided this behaviour was a reasonable reflection of true behaviour, would give us new data. Because this is a virtual rather than real world, with shocks controlled and regulated, that could make it easier to address issues of causality and identification in response to shocks, including policy shocks.</p> <p>There are already multi-person games with primitive economies attached to them, which allow goods and monies to change hands between participants. These include EVE Online and World of Warcraft. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2018/will-big-data-keep-its-promise-speech-by-andy-haldane.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=00A4AB2F080BDCDB1781D11DF6EC9BDA560F3D98\">The speech is online here</a></strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ae70e65e4b05b151652c6bc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-30T13:38:43.802Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Press Association have published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/30/sainsburys-asda-merger-biggest-supermarket-tsb-banking-business-live?page=with:block-5ae6af2ae4b0ed4091d28869#block-5ae6af2ae4b0ed4091d28869\">a Q&amp;A on the Sainsbury-Asda deal</a>.</strong></p> <p><em>Q: What will it mean for shop prices? </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The two supermarket giants have pledged to invest the cost efficiencies generated from the merger into lower prices.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s expects to save \u00a3500m from merging with Asda, and has said it will lower shop prices by 10% on everyday products.</p> <p>However, this could have more widespread implications for shop prices if discounters Aldi and Lidl decide to cut their prices even further to stay ahead of their main-market rivals.</p> <p>Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe executives of other supermarkets will have their heads in their hands at the prospect of another price war.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Q: What will it mean for stores? </em></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will soon start its investigation of the proposed merger, raising the prospect that Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda will be forced to sell off stores if they directly compete in local areas. </p> <p>However, Sainsbury\u2019s insisted on Monday that it does not expect to shut any stores.

As of Thursday 26th April, we were able to serve c.450,000. This is consistent with the number of sessions we would expect to serve.</p> <p>On Monday 23rd April approximately 72% of customers attempting to access the mobile app were successful on first attempt. As of Friday 27th April this had risen to approximately 93%. This is typical of the proportion we would have seen pre-migration. </p> </blockquote> <p>Pester also confirms that more than 400 customers saw another customer\u2019s account details - because the two accounts were linked:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>TSB, like many other banks, enable customers to nominate a third party to have access to their accounts - these are called nominee accounts. Typically this will be a parent having access to a child\u2019s account or a grown-up child managing an ageing parent\u2019s account. The ability for the third party to see the customer\u2019s account information is usually limited to branch and telephony channels.</p> <p>However, on the evening of Sunday 22nd April access was provided via digital channels. In addition, as well as enabling the third party to see the customer\u2019s data, the customer was able to see the third party\u2019s data. Therefore, in the \u201cparent and child\u201d example, the parent could see the child\u2019s transaction data but the child could also see the parent\u2019s transaction data.</p> <p> This explains some of the comments in social media where customers expecting to be overdrawn (the \u201cchild\u201d) could see large credit balances (the \u201cparent\u201d). No personal data was visible, just account balance data. </p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, Pester also admits that customers faced <strong>an average wait of one hour</strong> if they tried to phone TSB a week ago; by Thursday, this had dropped to 30 minutes (although some customers have reported much longer waits).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/treasury/Correspondence/2017-19/paul-pester-tsb-problems-270418.pdf\">The full letter is online here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ae70f9be4b026c402d87e9c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-30T12:50:37.025Z\">1.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TSB to face MPs over IT crisis on Wednesday</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Get the popcorn in!</strong></p> <p>Britain\u2019s Treasury Committee will be grilling Paul Pester, TSB\u2019s chief executive, and the bank\u2019s chairman Richard Meddings, on Wednesday.</p> <p>The committee will demand answers about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/28/warning-signs-for-tsbs-it-meltdown-were-clear-a-year-ago-insider\">exactly how TSB\u2019s IT systems collapsed more than a week ago</a>, and how they will compensate affected customers.</p> <p>Committee chair Nicky Morgan MP says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThe Treasury Committee is extremely concerned by the problems at TSB, and by the apparent miscommunication to customers about the extent and nature of these problems.</p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s been reported that services such as online banking have been down for some TSB customers for over a week.

The deep-discounters have disrupted the UK supermarket sector severely, and now have a combined market share of approximately 12%. Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda are the second and third-largest supermarkets by market share, and should the deal go ahead, it would put them in first place. Sainsbury\u2019s predict it will save \u00a3500 million through synergies.

Sainsbury\u2019s seems to be continuing the offensive against online players such as Amazon and discount grocery retailers such as Aldi and Lidl that Tesco started last year with its merger with Booker. </p> <p>The deal will help Sainsbury fend off this new competition. It will also mark Walmart\u2019s operational exit from the UK, as part of its strategic decisions to instead work through partnerships in international markets.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Amisha Chohan, e</strong>quity research analyst at <strong>Quilter Cheviot</strong>, says the deal is a \u201cmasterstroke\u201d - as long as the CMA approve it.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would result in the company becoming the biggest grocer in the UK, ahead of Tesco. Its guided net synergies of over \u00a3500m seem prudent and we believe it could be significantly in excess of this. Sainsbury\u2019s experience from the Argos acquisition should enable it to deliver ahead of the synergy guidance.</p> <p>Although this news is not ideal for Tesco, we remain positive on the UK\u2019s current largest retailer due its recent takeover of Booker, and the wholesale opportunities this will bring.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Mumford</strong> of <strong>Cavendish Asset Management</strong> believes Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda will be forced to sell some stores to get this deal \u201cthrough the hoop\u201d:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Store disposals could naturally be offered to others in the sector with M+S and Morrisons being the most likely tenants, but it\u2019s hardly the best climate to be a net seller of large retail space. There will of course be some management synergies too, so a proclamation of no job cuts will no doubt be reversed soon enough. </p> <p>This will obviously create a mighty force. But the big questions now are what influence will Walmart have on the group? And where does this leave other players? Sainsburys already has a big challenge to show that the Argos acquisition is bearing fruit, and now it\u2019s faced with driving cost synergies from Asda. The indicated 10% lower prices on regularly bought products will have raised eyebrows amongst the food producers who will fear another squeeze on margins. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ae6df4ae4b05b151652c4e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-30T09:26:09.192Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Competition authorities: We'll take a look</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain\u2019s competition watchdog have confirmed they are likely to review the Sainsbury-Asda deal.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sainsburys-asda-proposed-merger\">In a statement</a>, the Competition and Markets Authority says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This merger is likely to be subject to review by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p> </blockquote> <p>The CMA adds that it will assess whether the merger is bad for customers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>During a Phase 1 review, the CMA would assess whether the deal could reduce competition and choice for shoppers.</p> <p>After this first phase, the merger could be cleared or, if a potential reduction in competition is identified, it would be referred for an in-depth, Phase 2 investigation lasting up to 24 weeks - unless the merging parties offered immediate proposals to address any competition concerns identified.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ae6dd99e4b026c402d87ca1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-30T09:17:23.769Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The surge in Sainsbury\u2019s shares this morning is a blow to speculators who have been betting against the supermarket.</strong></p> <p>Some major hedge funds have been \u2018shorting\u2019 Sainsbury\u2019s shares recently, by selling borrowed shares and hoping to buy them back cheaper in future.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The EU has warned that it will not \u201cshoot from the hip\u201d but is fully prepared for a trade war with the US amid heightened concerns that the bloc\u2019s last minute crisis talks are doomed to fail. With tariffs on steel and aluminium on European exports to the US due to come into force on Tuesday, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European commissioner for trade, made a final diplomatic push in call with the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. A European commission spokesman declined to comment on the success of the talks, with Brussels seemingly still in the dark over Donald Trump\u2019s mindset. But he conceded that officials were likely to need to work through the 1 May Labour Day bank holiday in Belgium on Tuesday when the US president\u2019s decision is expected to be made public. \u201cWe are patient but we are also prepared,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cLabour Day will be full of labour for us.\u201d The US administration imposed import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium in March on the grounds of national security. The EU, along with Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea, were granted a temporary reprieve, but that is due to come to an end on 1 May. The main focus of the import tariffs is China, with whom the US has a $375bn (\u00a3273bn) trade deficit. However, Trump has been scathing about the current terms of trade with Europe. He has been particularly exercised by the success of German car exports in the US. Washington imposes a 2.5% tariff on cars made in Europe and a 25% tariff on EU-built vans and trucks. Europe imposes a 10% tariff on American-made cars. On Sunday, Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel spoke by phone to agree that the EU would hit back in response to the imposition of tariffs on European exporters. Merkel said Europe was \u201cresolved to defend its interests within the multilateral trade framework\u201d. A Downing Street spokesman said the leaders had spoken of \u201cthe vital importance of our steel and aluminium industries and their concern about the impact of US tariffs\u201d and \u201cpledged to continue to work closely with the rest of the EU and the US administration with the aim of a permanent exemption from US tariffs\u201d. The EU has suggested it is open to discussing the wider terms of trade with the US but only once it has received a permanent and unconditional exemption to the steel and aluminium tariffs. Trump has reportedly expressed his irritation that he cannot negotiate bilaterally with the key member states, rather than work through the EU institutions. In their previous phone call, Ross was rebuffed by Malmstr\u00f6m after he demanded that the EU voluntarily limit exports of steel and aluminium to 90% of the average 2016-17 level, reducing European imports by 16.3%. Speaking on Sunday in Abu Dhabi to Bloomberg TV, the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said a trade war would be \u201cextremely negative\u201d for both sides. \u201cI admit, I am concerned that there could be some new trade barriers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it comes to that, I hope that we as the EU can come to agreement very quickly on a common and clear position. \u201cI hope that this won\u2019t unleash any negative spiral that leads to a trade war and that, rather, the US will reconsider its ideas about trade barriers.\u201d This article was amended on 8 May 2018 to correct the figure given for the US-China trade deficit.",

      "bodyText": "WPP is to sell stakes worth billions of pounds that it holds in a wide range of companies, as the world\u2019s largest advertising group looks to refocus after the departure of founder Sir Martin Sorrell. The company has what analysts have called a \u201chidden treasure trove\u201d of assets that are not part of its core business, such as a 9% stake in Vice, which as a business is valued at about $6bn. WPP says the book value of these investments is about \u00a32.5bn. However, analysts believe the true market value could be more than \u00a36bn. The assets also include 15% of digital advertising business AppNexus, which is lining up a potential $10bn stock market listing, and a holding in the Nasdaq-listed software group Globant. \u201cThere would be a lot of demand for our equity stakes in some of those investments,\u201d said Andrew Scott, who is co-running WPP while a successor to Sorrell is found. \u201cWe have had some very successful investments. We have tended to not proactively make an exit unless forced by a sale or IPO. Is there an opportune moment to realise value in some of those investments? That will definitely be a focus going forward.\u201d The company said it intends to use some of the proceeds to help pay down WPP\u2019s debt by \u00a3750m to improve its balance sheet profile. Roberto Quarta, the WPP chairman, was quizzed by City analysts at its first-quarter results presentation over the decision not to publish the outcome of the investigation into personal misconduct that prompted Sorrell to resign. \u201cMartin resigned. Martin was not terminated,\u201d Quarta said. \u201cThis came about at the end of the investigation. When the results of the investigation were known, Martin decided to resign before the board had taken into consideration the outcome of the investigation and determine whether or not it was appropriate to take action. I think that\u2019s important for everybody to be clear on. We have no requirement to disclose or necessity to disclose.\u201d He added that the issue of personal misconduct \u201cis really what we consider to be a matter of privacy and therefore it\u2019s a matter for Martin. And hence the reason why we did not disclose.\u201d WPP bosses have signalled a willingness to sell off underperforming parts of the global marketing empire but have ruled out a complete break-up following Sorrell\u2019s departure, as shares surged almost 9% after a better-than-expected first quarter. WPP is already running the rule over the future of the market research arm, Kantar, which continues to underperform, and has received an approach from the private capital group CVC. The market research division, which accounts for 15% of WPP\u2019s profits and 18% of revenues, is valued at about \u00a33.5bn. \u201cHaving worked here 20 years or more and talking to clients, and seeing what they want, it doesn\u2019t make sense to break it up,\u201d said Mark Read, who is jointly running WPP alongside Scott and is keen to take on the vacant chief executive role. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t look at specific asset sales.\u201d Analysts believe a sale of the parts of WPP could net investors at least \u00a322bn. WPP\u2019s market capitalisation is \u00a314bn and its share price has fallen by more than a quarter in the past year. WPP reported a fall in revenue of just 0.1% to \u00a32.94bn in the first quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of a fall of about 1%. WPP, which is facing a global review of the creative advertising business of its biggest client, Ford, has improved significantly from a poor start in which like-for-like revenues fell 1.2% in January. Nevertheless, it is its worst first-quarter performance in the best part of decade. This followed the world\u2019s largest ad group weathering its worst year for growth since the recession in 2009, with a 0.9% fall in 2017. Read said WPP\u2019s media buying, digital and PR businesses did well, and geographically the company performed well in faster-growing markets such as Asia Pacific and Latin America. He said the company was underperforming in North America and the businesses \u201cmost challenged by structural changes in advertising and parts of market research\u201d. The results mark the last with Sorrell as chief executive after he resigned in April from the company he founded 33 years ago.",

      "bodyText": "Carpetright has warned that its full-year losses will be double those previously expected, as the struggling retailer received backing from creditors and shareholders for a restructuring process designed to stave off administration. Issuing its fourth profit warning in five months, Britain\u2019s biggest carpet retailer now expects to make an underlying pretax loss of \u00a37m to \u00a39m for the year to the end of April. A month ago, the firm was forecasting a \u201csmall loss\u201d, and house broker Peel Hunt pencilled in a \u00a34.3m loss. At the start of this year, the City was still expecting profits of \u00a313m. Trading has been tougher than expected, with like-for-like sales slumping 10.5% in the past three months. Over the full year, like-for-like sales fell by 3.6%. As with other retailers, especially those selling home furnishings, Carpetright has been hit by weak consumer confidence and the slowdown in the housing market, with fewer people buying carpets and furniture. The company said publicity around its restructuring had also negatively affected sales. Carpetright is shutting 92 stores, with the potential loss of 300 jobs, and has asked landlords for rent reductions of up to 50% on 113 more sites under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). The CVA was approved by more than 75% of the unsecured creditors and also received backing from shareholders on Monday. Carpetright stressed that the company continued to trade under the control of the directors, operating as a going concern, and would not go into administration as a result of the CVA. The retailer added it hoped to secure interim funding of up to \u00a315m from its banks and expected to launch an equity fundraising on 18 May. Wilf Walsh, the Carpetright chief executive, said: \u201cThe CVA proposal will enable us to take the tough but necessary actions needed to restore our profitability. Having now received approval from both shareholders and creditors we will press ahead with our plans for the proposed equity financing to recapitalise the business and enable Carpetright to address the competitive threat from a position of strength.\u201d Under Walsh, about half of Carpetright\u2019s stores have been modernised and are performing better than the rest.",

Carpetright stressed that the company continued to trade under the control of the directors, operating as a going concern, and would not go into administration as a result of the CVA.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The retailer added it hoped to secure interim funding of up to \u00a315m from its banks and expected to launch an equity fundraising on 18 May.</p> <p>Wilf Walsh, the Carpetright chief executive, said: \u201cThe CVA proposal will enable us to take the tough but necessary actions needed to restore our profitability.

      "bodyText": "TSB\u2019s IT meltdown has entered its second week, with some customers still unable to access their accounts or make payments. One of the worst crises in British banking was caused by a botched migration of data from one IT system to another and has affected up to 1.9 million mobile and online banking customers at the Spanish-owned bank. On Thursday, TSB called in experts from IBM and asked them to fix the problems by Saturday. However, in its most recent online update, TSB said it was continuing to work hard to fix the problems, and a spokeswoman confirmed the situation was the same on Monday. Several TSB customers took to social media to report continuing problems on Monday morning. The bank\u2019s beleaguered chief executive, Paul Pester, has promised that customers will not be left out of pocket. Iona Bain, the founder of the Young Money Blog, tweeted: Moving customers from the Lloyds legacy systems to a new database was expected to save the bank\u2019s owners, Sabadell, \u00a3100m a year. Now the bank faces having to pay out a similar amount in compensation to customers and potential fines by the Financial Conduct Authority, which dispatched a team to TSB to monitor the situation. Pester has refused to answer questions about his \u00a31.6m bonus, which is due to be paid once the IT migration is complete, along with bonuses for 30 other senior staff. The bank reiterated that the decision on bonuses lay with the remuneration committee of the TSB board, and no decision had been made.",
