      "bodyText": "Job opportunities in the retail sector are expected to fall to their lowest level for five years as shop owners claw back the costs of the government\u2019s new living wage. About a third of employers in the retail sector intend to restrict the number of new jobs as higher pay packets for the lowest-paid staff eat into profit levels and cut dividend payouts. A survey of 2,100 employers by the recruitment firm Manpower found that retailers were the most likely to claw back the costs of the living wage, which came into effect in April, as they consider advertising new jobs over the next three months. James Hick, a spokesman for Manpower, said the national living wage, which pays \u00a37.20 an hour to 25-year-olds and over, has prompted retailers to register the biggest fall in optimism about their hiring intentions since 2011. Hick said the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the referendum was also deterring employers from advertising new jobs, a situation that will only get worse if the UK leaves the EU. The report found the UK would be \u201ccritically short\u201d of workers if EU workers were no longer able to move freely to this country. Leaving the EU would be particularly damaging for top construction firms, which traditionally rely on European workers, and have been warning for months of skills shortages, said the report. Hick said: \u201cBritain added 404,000 jobs in the last 12 months alone, and despite the uncertainties of Brexit, employers tell us they still need more workers. \u201cMake no mistake about the vital contribution EU workers make to Britain. There are currently 2.2 million people from the EU working in the UK, but not all of them will stay here in the long term and we need the opportunity to replace the skills they bring. \u201cBritain today is a magnet for international talent, from finance to tech to the NHS. Leaving the EU will make it much more difficult to attract the brightest and best.\u201d Employers in the West Midlands and Wales were most positive about taking on new staff, while the least optimistic were in Yorkshire and Humberside.",

    "webTitle": "New research: Abbott and Turnbull the worst economic managers since Menzies | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "New research by the Australia Institute reveals that across a broad range of economic measures, the Abbott/Turnbull government has performed the worst of any Australian government since Menzies took power in 1949. The institute\u2019s paper also notes that historically there is little correlation between \u201cbusiness friendly\u201d policies and economic performance. Inevitably election campaigns become focused on economic management. On this score historically, the Liberal Party is usually assumed to be the better economic manager. For example, a poll earlier this month by the Essential Report had voters preferring the LNP over the ALP on the issue of who they trusted on \u201cmanagement of the economy\u201d by 39% to 27%. Such a belief is behind the Liberal party\u2019s main desire to fight the election campaign on their economic plan, the central feature of which is the company tax cut. With this has come much commentary that the ALP is waging a war on business, and that being anti-business (or at least anti the company tax cut) means being against strong economic performance. But a report by the Australia Institute to be released today titled \u201cJobs and Growth ... And a Few Hard Numbers\u201d shows that there is little correlation between economic performance and either political party. The report, which examines the economic performance of Australia under every prime minister since Menzies, also found that the \u201cbusiness friendliness\u201d of a government does not appear to have much impact either. The report examines economic performance across a range of 12 indicators \u2013 including GDP per capita, the unemployment rate, employment growth and the growth of real business investment and intellectual property investment. The findings by economist Jim Stanford showed that on all but two measures, the performance under the Abbott/Turnbull government has been worse than that under the Gillard government. Only on the measure of growth of government debt as a share of GDP is the Abbott/Turnbull government \u201cbetter\u201d. But even if you agree with the proposition that lower government debt is a good thing, the Abbott/Turnbull growth of 2.16% of GDP is only marginally better than the 2.26% of GDP growth observed under the Gillard government. The lack of connection between economic growth and business friendliness is highlighted by the fact that GDP per capita growth was strongest under the Holt government and yet that government had the third worst level of business investment growth, but the largest growth of public sector investment: While there is more of a link between the investment in intellectual property and GDP growth, it is not a measure that would provide Malcolm Turnbull with any joy. For all his desire to be agile and innovative, the Australia Institute found that the growth of intellectual property investment during the Abbott/Turnbull government was the second worst in the post-war era. Employment is one area that certainly sees governments somewhat hostage to their times. The post war period under Menzies, Holt and Gorton/McMahon saw negligible unemployment. But as I have previously noted, it is rather easier to have less than 2% unemployment when two-thirds of women are not in the labour force. The findings also reflect the changing nature of employment, with the increase in part-time work leading to recent governments having lower levels of the adult population employed full-time. This has also been exacerbated since the GFC. Since September 2008, part-time employment has grown by 26.8%, while full-time employment has grown by just 6.9%: While it might be unfair to only examine full-time employment, as Stanford notes, when looking at economic health, full-time employment will always be the better indicator given \u201cpart-time jobs generate less output and less income than full-time positions.\u201d An examination of income and wages growth also shows the current situation being much worse than in the past: The pre-1970s saw strong wages growth and also strong income growth partly due, as Stanford notes, to \u201cthe expansion of social welfare programs.\u201d But real wages growth since the Fraser government has been much weaker than it was previously and the current Abbott/Turnbull government has seen the worst performance ever. The government can also claim the post-WWII record of lowest growth in personal income. The records don\u2019t stop there however. The current government has also seen the largest expansion of private household debt, beating that observed under the Howard government. Record low wages and income growth coupled with record increase in household debt. Not really something you\u2019d want to boast about. The government can\u2019t really boast about the level of government debt either. While it has grown by less than under either the Rudd or Gillard governments there is little sense of a slowdown. Although it is tough to judge this against economic performance. Had Abbott and Turnbull sought to slow the growth of government debt faster than they have, it would likely have led to slower economic growth. But there really is no sense however that Turnbull and Scott Morrison can claim they have brought debt under control: As Stanford concludes, \u201cit is clear from the comparison of the successive governments that broader, often global forces have more effect on Australian economic performance than discretionary policy\u201d. Generally speaking if you wish to be a government that presides over strong economic growth, is pays to govern at a time when the world economy is growing strongly. Stanford notes that the long post-second world war boom was fuelled here and in the rest of the world by \u201cstrong investment, a growing public sector, and rising real incomes.\u201d Similarly the 1970s here and abroad were a time of \u201cglobal stagflation\u201d and the rebound occurred \u201cduring the global commodities boom. Australia has also been unable to avoid the slow growth period after the GFC that has hit the world. Stanford suggests that ascribing these observed swings to the relative \u201ceconomic competence\u201d of successive governments is far-fetched. One problem with the current view of economic competence is that the most obvious comparison is the strong growth under the Howard government during the mining boom. GDP grew stronger during Howard\u2019s government than it had since 1960, while under Rudd it was the weakest it had been under any such government. Under Howard, GDP grew by 3.7% on average each year, well above the 2.2% of the Rudd government, so it\u2019s not surprising most people think Howard (and thus the Liberal party) was a better economic manager. But the times were much different. Howard\u2019s average growth was just 0.85% better than the average 2.85% growth observed throughout the OECD. By contrast Rudd\u2019s GDP growth was 2.9% better than the OECD which saw GDP fall by 0.7% during Rudd\u2019s period in office: In effect Howard was a very good downhill skier \u2013 good at looking good while things were easy; but the Rudd (and Gillard and Keating) governments were much better at outperforming the rest of the world. And surely that is the best guide of economic management.",

Field\u2019s remark, one suspects, was prompted by the rumour that Green was preparing to offer \u00a3150m directly to BHS pensioners.

The size of the shortfall in the scheme \u2013 \u00a3571m, on one measure \u2013 means the Pension Protection Fund, which is funded by a levy on solvent defined benefit schemes, would still be on the hook for a very large sum. In other words, \u00a3150m might not be generous in context. Field\u2019s phrasing may have been inelegant but, to use a Green phrase, that\u2019s showbiz. Indeed, the Topshop tycoon hasn\u2019t helped himself by saying next to nothing since the collapse of BHS. He could have issued a statement giving his version of events at any time. He could have disputed any of the allegations made by witnesses. Instead, he\u2019s stayed silent even as his original claim to have sold BHS in a good condition to a credible buyer has been steadily undermined. Green chose former bankrupt Dominic Chappell as a purchaser and, given the rapid collapse of BHS and the shortfall faced by pensioners, he should not be surprised that answers are being demanded. If Wednesday has assumed the status of a \u201cshowdown\u201d, Green is primarily to blame. He will \u2013 let\u2019s hope \u2013 drop his silly threats not to appear. A no-show would provoke attempts to strip him of his knighthood, which really would be an arbitrary process, and would not stop parliament trying to assert its authority. The bald facts for Green should be very simple: you\u2019re a British citizen and MPs wish to ask you legitimate questions, saying no is not an option. Changing Clarkes won\u2019t be enough for Asda Once upon a time, Walmart used to boast about its pride in owning Asda, citing the many trading ideas it had re-imported back to the US. The UK was regarded as the best of its foreign adventures. These days, it\u2019s almost as if Asda is viewed as an errant child whose existence has to be acknowledged in round-robin dispatches, but not dwelled upon. Asda wasn\u2019t even mentioned by name in the latest quarterly update to shareholders. Instead, there was a general grumble about how \u201ca highly competitive environment and food deflation in the UK continued to challenge the market\u201d. That environment is now so entrenched that even head office in Arkansas thinks something needs to be done. Asda chief executive Andy Clarke is out, to be replaced by Sean Clarke, who has earned his spurs running Walmart China. Changing Clarkes does not, in itself, signal a change of strategy. For that to happen, Walmart will have to acknowledge that the current softly-softly attempt to lower Asda\u2019s prices, while protecting its profit margins, is a flop. Like-for-like sales have fallen for seven quarters in a row. Aldi and Lidl have been the beneficiaries. The cure is permanently lower profit margins, to provide financial firepower to combat the discounters. Tesco and Morrisons have been dragged into that battle, and the scars show in their battered share prices. The grocery game is just less profitable than it was. If Asda is now preparing to lead a price war, the stakes will be raised again. But don\u2019t assume that outcome is inevitable. Walmart could have given Asda a licence to be more aggressive several years ago. Changing the local boss may herald a change of heart. But it could turn out to be another cop-out \u2013 an easy way to avoid making a hard decision on prices. LinkedIn accepts Microsoft\u2019s generous invitation LinkedIn is a networking website where ambitious office-workers go to make over-extended boasts about their professional achievements and ambitions.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The former BHS owner Dominic Chappell was trying to buy Austin Reed as the department store chain headed for collapse, it has emerged. Evidence submitted to MPs by Alan Jacobs, the founder of investment company Jacobs Capital, shows that Chappell held talks about buying the menswear retailer. The talks fell apart, however, because it \u201cbecame clear that Mr Chappell and Retail Acquisitions [his consortium] did not have access to sufficient funds to conclude such a transaction\u201d. The letter from Jacobs, a non-executive director of Austin Reed, raises further questions about Chappell\u2019s management of BHS. During the period in which he was in talks to buy Austin Reed, BHS was working on reducing its rental payments through a company voluntary arrangement, which was vital to securing its survival. Chappell\u2019s consortium bought BHS for \u00a31 from Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group in March 2015, but the company fell into administration 13 months later. Austin Reed collapsed last month after administrators failed to find a buyer for the chain, leading to the loss of 1,000 jobs and the closure of 120 shops. Chappell was described as a \u201cmythomaniac\u201d and \u201cPremier League liar\u201d at a parliamentary hearing last week. In his evidence to MPs, Chappell said Jacobs, who sits on the board of a number of companies, including Iceland, Reiss and Virgin Active, had provided advice to Retail Acquisitions. Jacobs first met Chappell in January 2015, according to his letter to MPs, and declined to join his consortium or become a non-executive director. Jacobs said he attended a meeting with BHS management at the request of Chappell and provided advice \u201con occasion\u201d once the deal was completed. \u201cMy conversations with Mr Chappell regarding BHS principally revolved around trading and working capital challenges. I was not privy to the terms of the deal to purchase BHS nor the negotiations leading up to the sale,\u201d he said. \u201cMore recently, our conversations related to the potential acquisition by Retail Acquisitions of Austin Reed Group.\u201d Jacobs said he was contacted by Chappell in October 2015 about the possibility of buying Austin Reed. A \u201cnumber of meetings and conversations\u201d took place between January and March until the talks broke down. In separate evidence to MPs, Chappell said he received \u00a32.63m from Retail Acquisitions and BHS during the period he controlled the retailer. This included \u00a31.6m of payments to Swiss Rock, a company he controlled, as well as \u00a3414,000 in \u201cpre-agreed fees\u201d and \u00a3650,000 in salary payments. Chappell also revealed that a \u00a31.5m loan against his father\u2019s home, paid by Retail Acquisitions, remains outstanding in full. He told MPs last week that some of the loan had been repaid. The former BHS owner sent a letter to MPs after promising to provide a breakdown of the payments between himself, Retail Acquisitions and BHS. However, Chappell said it will \u201ctake some time\u201d to provide full records. \u201cMr Frank Field [chairman of the work and pensions committee] requested that I confirm the actual amounts into my bank account net of taxation and expenses,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately obtaining full and accurate records will take some time as I am dependent upon third parties for some of that information. Therefore, I have taken the decision to provide the full gross amount of payments without delay as requested by the committee.\u201d Green is scheduled to appear in front of MPs on Wednesday in the latest stage of the investigation into the collapse of BHS. The tycoon has threatened to pull out of the hearing if Field does not resign from the committee, claiming that the MP is biased against him. However, Field has said he will not resign. The MPs on the work and pensions committee, and the business, innovation and skills committee, who are conducing a joint investigation, are pressing for three senior bankers at Goldman Sachs to appear in person to answer questions about BHS. MPs have called Michael Sherwood, the vice-chairman of Goldman and a long-time adviser to Green, and Michael Casey, also of Goldman, as well as recalling Anthony Gutman, the co-head of investment banking in Europe at Goldman, who gave evidence last month. The investment bank wrote to MPs on Friday to say that evidence provided by Chappell about the level of Goldman\u2019s involvement was \u201cnot correct\u201d and that it does not believe that its employees are able to provide any new evidence. However, Field and Iain Wright, chair of the business committee, said: \u201cThe evidence we have taken since has raised further questions on the involvement of Goldman Sachs, which we would like to explore in oral evidence. We are therefore confirming the invitation to those listed in the activity log \u2013 yourself [Sherwood], Mr Casey and Mr Gutman \u2013 to attend on the afternoon of Tuesday 28 June.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "London\u2019s leading stock market index has dropped for a third day and the pound touched a two-month low as Brexit fears gripped investors in the run-up to the EU referendum. Sterling slipped against the dollar and euro, but recovered to gain 1.3% as it reached levels of volatility not seen since the financial crash of 2008. Against the dollar the pound fell to almost $1.41 before touching $1.43 as values continued to swing. Some analysts said thin trading volumes meant most investors were sitting out the last week before the 23 June vote, leaving the market to be dominated by speculators increasingly concerned by the apparent crumbling of support for the remain campaign.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The departure of Andy Clarke from the top job at Asda means that each of the big four supermarket chains have changed their chief executive in the past two years. Since July 2014, Justin King has retired from Sainsbury\u2019s, Philip Clarke has been pushed out of Tesco and Dalton Philips has been sacked from Morrisons. That is a clear sign of the tumultuous change in Britain\u2019s grocery industry. The discounters Aldi and Lidl have taken market share at one end of the grocery market, with Waitrose and Marks &amp; Spencer grabbing spending at the other. At the same time, online shopping and convenience stores are eating into the sales of out-of-town supermarkets. It is only a coincidence that Asda announced the change days after Amazon revealed that it is launching its grocery service, Amazon Fresh, in London. Amazon\u2019s announcement also showed how quickly the grocery market is changing. Asda, in particular, cannot afford to stand still. It has suffered a decline in like-for-like sales, which measures sales in stores open more than a year, for seven quarters in a row. This drop has not been small. In the last three months of 2015, Asda sales fell by 5.8% year on year, the worst performance in its history. In the first three months of this year, Asda\u2019s performance improved, but not by much, to a sales decline of 5.7%. Judging Asda\u2019s performance is difficult because it is part of Walmart, the biggest retailer in the world, rather than a separate listed entity such as Tesco or Sainsbury\u2019s. For example, it is never clear when Walmart is pushing Asda to deliver sales growth or profits. While sales have been falling over the past two years, profits have held relatively firm. Walmart, though, has clearly decided that Asda needs to stop losing market share. There had been rumours that Clarke could depart Asda for a year. These increased when the company poached Roger Burnley from Sainsbury\u2019s to become chief operating officer. In fact, the only surprise about the news of Clarke\u2019s exit is that it is not Burnley replacing him but Sean Clarke, a former Asda employee who has been running Walmart\u2019s Chinese business. The challenge facing Sean Clarke is to stop Asda getting lost in the middle of the grocery market between the discounters and the rest of the big four. Asda had built a niche with customers as being cheaper than the Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Tesco, while having better quality food than the discounters. This niche meant that between 2010 and 2014, the first four years of Andy Clarke\u2019s tenure, it performed robustly. However, Tesco and Morrisons have pushed down their prices significantly under Dave Lewis and David Potts, their current chief executives. At the same time, Aldi and Lidl have continued to expand. Suddenly, Asda\u2019s niche has disappeared. Sean Clarke\u2019s job will be to lead a fightback.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s equality watchdog has criticised British airlines and British Airways (BA) in particular \u2013 for their treatment of disabled customers as legal action is taken by an actor over alleged damage to her wheelchair. Chris Holmes, the disability commissioner on the Equality and Human Rights Commission and a highly successful Paralympic athlete, said carriers should cover the full cost of damage they cause to wheelchairs and mobility devices. Lord Holmes, who represented Great Britain for 17 years at swimming and won nine gold medals, specifically mentioned the case of disabled actor Athena Stevens. Stevens is taking legal action against BA and London City airport over damage she says happened when she was trying to make a working trip to Glasgow in October last year. She has previously said that the \u00a325,000 chair \u2013 which she alleges was damaged beyond repair \u2013 was not insured because no company was willing to cover it. It is understood neither the airline nor the airport have admitted liability for the damage. BA said it was seeking a suitable resolution with Stevens and told the Guardian it took the needs of those with reduced mobility extremely seriously, and exceeded international rules over compensation where it was responsible for damage. Holmes questioned whether BA, official airline of both Team GB for the Olympics and the national Paralympic team in Rio de Janeiro this summer, would treat athletes in the same way as they did other disabled customers. Holmes said: \u201cDisabled people are often deterred from flying for fear of loss, damage or destruction of their mobility equipment. Athena\u2019s story is a case in point. \u201cShe has been left without a replacement chair for eight months. We\u2019re not talking about a suitcase or a set of golf clubs \u2013 this is a person\u2019s mobility and independence. \u201cConsidering that BA is a main sponsor of Team GB, I think it\u2019s fair to ask whether this practice would equally apply to competing athletes, and if so, whether the Paralympic team been made aware that British Airways will not cover the full cost if their equipment is damaged.\u201d Holmes said air carriers could \u201chide behind\u201d the Montreal convention, a series of rules for international air carriers, to avoid paying fully for damaged equipment vital for those with disabilities. The convention calculates compensation for damaged equipment by weight rather than value. Holmes said: \u201cThis unfair policy is trapping disabled people in a cycle of disadvantage, and British air carriers have the moral responsibility to stop applying it to disabled customers\u2019 mobility equipment, as it\u2019s clearly unfit for purpose.\u201d The UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority warns people with disabilities that amounts paid for damaged equipment \u201cmay be limited to around \u00a31,300\u201d. The EHRC , which has its own guide for disabled passengers, says airlines such as Lufthansa and Air Canada make clear they go beyond the provisions of the Montreal convention, while the European commission encourages carriers to go beyond the liability limits. In the US, the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) states that for domestic flights the \u201ccriterion for calculating the compensation for a lost, damaged or destroyed wheelchair or other assistive device shall be the original purchase price of the device\u201d. British Airways said in a statement: \u201cMore than 426,000 people with reduced mobility travelled with us last year and we take their needs extremely seriously. \u201cWe always take great care when transporting wheelchairs. However, there are rare occasions when damage occurs,\u201d the airline said. \u201cIn those circumstances when we are responsible, we pay compensation to the value of the damage caused over and above the limits of the Montreal agreement. \u201cWe are speaking with Ms Stevens and her legal representatives to reach a suitable resolution.\u201d London City airport said: \u201cWe have been in communication with Ms Stevens from the outset and the airport has made every effort to assist her in resolving this situation. We are awaiting a response. Because this is a legal matter we are unable to provide further comment.\u201d The British Paralympic Association said: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that BA have made the commitment to ParalympicsGB and are confident they are making great plans to ensure our Paralympic athletes are given a world class service.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And finally, back to Microsoft\u2019s proposed $26bn purchase of LinkedIn, and the hefty earnings multiple it is paying: Meanwhile the deal could see increased competition for US group Salesforce, says Julia Langley, partner at advisory group Results International: Microsoft\u2019s core business is built around enterprise productivity software. They\u2019ve been increasingly under threat from all sorts of players competing for pole position in this space. Google and Facebook, two of the biggest tech companies in the world with strong consumer propositions have moved heavily into this enterprise area, with Facebook at Work and Google for Work. Doing nothing was not an option for Microsoft, hence this massive, bold coup. LinkedIn is one of the best new business/sales tools in the world of B2B and in many ways competes head on with Salesforce. When Microsoft integrates LinkedIn with its CRM suite, Dynamics, what you have is a hugely powerful tool that is truly differentiated and one that poses a real threat to Salesforce. ... If anyone is going to be feeling unnerved by the deal, it\u2019s Salesforce. We should expect to see some sort of announcement from then in the months ahead. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on the growing lead for Brexit, Joshua Raymond of broker XTB.com said: With the latest ICM poll showing support for a Brexit strengthening on both online and phone polls, investors continue to be concerned and are expected to downsize their positions in UK stocks and holdings in pounds sterling. The fact we are not seeing any degree of volatility in the latest polls, which all point to a healthy lead for the leave campaign is making investors risk averse. And here is the latest ICM poll, showing the Leave campaign further in the lead. Tom Clarke reports: Support for leaving the EU is strengthening, with both phone and online surveys reporting a six-point lead, according to a new pair of Guardian/ICM polls. Leave now enjoys a 53%-47% advantage once \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d are excluded, according to the research conducted over the weekend compared with a 52%-48% split reported by ICM a fortnight ago. The pound is down around 0.18% at $1.4221 following the poll news. It took 14 years for LinkedIn to grow into a business worth $26bn to Microsoft, and my colleague Sean Farrell has taken a look at the company\u2019s history: The $26bn deal for Microsoft to buy LinkedIn has done little to support stock markets, which are more concerned with a global slowdown and the consequences of the UK voting to leave the European Union. With talk of the latest ICM poll showing a lead for the Leave camp, markets have slumped once again. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 fell to its lowest level since March 10, down 70.79 points or 1.16% to 6044.97 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.8% to 9657.44 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.85% lower at 4227.02 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 64 points or 0.36%. The pound, having slumped earlier and then recovered, has now slipped back again against the dollar, down marginally on the day from $1.4252 at $1.4240. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Microsoft has clearly found another use for some of its cash, and while LinkedIn may have faded from view as the market focusses on the triumphs of Facebook and the travails of Twitter, the social network\u2019s database offers a tantalising way to expand Microsoft\u2019s reach once more. The use of debt rather than stock will reassure those that worry this is another sign of a market top, and will have the added benefit of raising the prospect of a buyer for Twitter. In an email to LinkedIn employees, chief executive Jeff Weiner says the Microsoft deal is best for the company: No matter what you\u2019re feeling now, give yourself some time to process the news. You might feel a sense of excitement, fear, sadness, or some combination of all of those emotions. Every member of the exec team has experienced the same, but we\u2019ve had months to process. Regardless of the ups and downs, we\u2019ve come out the other side knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is the best thing for our company. He continues: Some of you may be asking \u201cWhy Microsoft?\u201d Long before [Microsoft boss} Satya [Nadella] and I first sat down to talk about how we could work together, I had publicly shared my thoughts on how impressive his efforts were to rapidly transition Microsoft\u2019s strategy and culture. After all, it\u2019s extremely rare to see a company of that scope and scale move so quickly to make fundamental changes. The Microsoft that has evolved under Satya\u2019s leadership is a more agile, innovative, open and purpose-driven company. It was that latter point that first had me thinking we could make this work, but it was his thoughts on how we\u2019d do it that got me truly excited about the prospect.... Essentially, we\u2019re both trying to do the same thing but coming at it from two different places: For LinkedIn, it\u2019s the professional network, and for Microsoft, the professional cloud. [On the structure of the deal] I had no idea what Satya was going to propose, but knew how difficult acquisition integrations could be if not established the right way from the start. Long story short, Satya had me at \u201cindependence.\u201d In other words, his vision was to operate LinkedIn as a fully independent entity within Microsoft, a model used with great success by companies like YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meanwhile back in the foreign exchange market, sterling has recovered all its losses ahead of the forthcoming ICM poll. Despite the excitement about the $26bn deal for Microsoft to buy LinkedIn, the overall US market has failed to move into positive territory. With worries about a global slowdown and the impact of a vote by the UK to leave the EU, the Dow Jones Industrial average has dipped 0.02%, Nasdaq is down 0.12% and the S&amp;P 500 is 0.13% lower. With Twitter shares up on speculation it could be the next to be snapped up after LinkedIn, some believe a deal could make sense. Saxo Bank head of equity Peter Garnry thinks Google could buy the business by the year end. Twitter has 350 millions users, but it has been a problem for the company to grow its user base, he said. Nevertheless Twitter has managed to increase its cash flow profitability over the last 4-5 quarters and on a cashflow basis the company is improving rapidly. He said it had been difficult for Google to create a social media space stronghold and for that reason he thought Twitter would be a good fit for Google. This deal even beats that $19bn which Facebook splashed out on WhatsApp in February 2014..... Microsoft is getting the cash for this deal though issuing new debt, rather than tapping its own cash pile. Why would it do that? Because it\u2019s more tax efficient; Microsoft won\u2019t have to repatriate any of the cash currently held offshore back into the US (where it would face higher taxes). [Oxfam singled out Microsoft in a report condemning tax havens back in April] Here\u2019s Alex Hern\u2019s news story on the Microsoft-LinkedIn deal: And here\u2019s a flavour: If the deal with Microsoft goes through as planned, Jeff Weiner, who joined LinkedIn in 2008 as the company\u2019s president before becoming chief executive later that year, will stay on in his current role, reporting directly to Microsoft boss Satya Nadella. In a statement, Nadella hinted at the competitive advantage he expects the network to provide for Microsoft. He said LinkedIn would pair well with the company\u2019s business-focused software such as Office and customer relationship manager Dynamics. Over on Wall Street, LinkedIn shares have jumped by 47% to $193 in early trading. That\u2019s close to the $196 per shares which Microsoft is paying, suggesting the deal is expected to pass. Microsoft\u2019s shares have fallen by 4% \u2013 as explained earlier, that\u2019s a typical reaction when a company announces a significant acquisition. And this really is a significant deal, as the BBC\u2019s Rory Cellan-Jones explains: Social media is buzzing with reaction to Microsoft\u2019s $26bn cash splurge acquisition: LinkedIn gives Microsoft a serious presence in the business social networking business, says mobile analyst Ben Wood of CCS Insight: Shares in Twitter are rallying in early trading; perhaps on speculation that it could now be snapped up. This is Satya Nadella\u2019s biggest deal since he replaced Steve Ballmer as Microsoft\u2019s CEO in February 2014. Nadella says he\u2019s been thinking about buying LinkedIn for a while, and he\u2019ll need to persuade analysts that it really makes sense, given the huge price tag. It also dwarfs MS\u2019s other recent deals - buying Nokia\u2019s mobile phone business for $7bn in 2013, and online telephony firm Skype for $8.5bn in 2011. The Nokia deal hasn\u2019t been a great success, given Microsoft laid off 1,850 staff at its smartphone business last month. The Economist\u2019s Stanley Pignal is hoping that the deluge of LinkedIn notifications might now ease... Augustin Eden at City firm Accendo Markets (who doesn\u2019t sound like a great fan of LinkedIn) explains why Microsoft\u2019s shares are likely to suffer today: Shares in professional networking/dating/narcissism website LinkedIn are called to open around 40% higher at the US open after confirmation it has welcomed a mammoth takeover approach from Microsoft constituting a nigh on 50% premium over Friday\u2019s share price close. Shares in Microsoft were understandably suspended from trading in the lead-up to this bit of news, given that the traditional reaction to such an announcement often involves a shareholder exodus from the predator. With this deal lightening Microsoft\u2019s coffers to the tune of $26bn, make that an exodus of biblical proportions. Today\u2019s announcement is full of cheerful quotes justifying the deal. Here\u2019s a selection: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella: \u201cThe LinkedIn team has grown a fantastic business centered on connecting the world\u2019s professionals. Together we can accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, as well as Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics as we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet.\u201d LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner: Just as we have changed the way the world connects to opportunity, this relationship with Microsoft, and the combination of their cloud and LinkedIn\u2019s network, now gives us a chance to also change the way the world works. LinkedIn chairman Reid Hoffmann Today is a re-founding moment for LinkedIn. I see incredible opportunity for our members and customers and look forward to supporting this new and combined business. I fully support this transaction and the Board\u2019s decision to pursue it, and will vote my shares in accordance with their recommendation on it. LinkedIn shareholders will be celebrating tonight.... Guys, there\u2019s only one joke about this deal...and it\u2019s been done. Many times.... Tech analyst Amir Mizroch explains the motivation behind the deal: Microsoft and LinkedIn have released a short video about the deal. In it, MS CEO Satya Nadella talks about his \u201cgreat admiration for LinkedIn\u201d.... and explained that his vision is to combine LinkedIn\u2019s productivity and communication tools with Microsoft\u2019s professional network. Cue uplifting talk about \u201cenhancing\u201d people\u2019s professional lives and \u201cempowering\u201d them to do better - either in their current job or the next one.... He\u2019s been tweeting that message too: Shares in Microsoft have slid by 5% in pre-market trading, as investors react to the news it\u2019s paying $26bn for LinkedIn. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Dennis Berman argues that LinkedIn has capitulated, by selling out to Microsoft. Walking away with $26bn (or \u00a318.5bn) ) is one heck of a capitulation, though.... This deal values each of LinkedIn\u2019s 433 million users at $60 each, points out Reuters\u2019 Peter Thal Larsen: Some users may be worth less.... Microsoft has swooped on LinkedIn four months after the company shocked Wall Street by missing its revenue forecasts. Back in February, LinkedIn revealed that its online ad revenue growth had slowed to 20% in the fourth quarter from 56% a year earlier. Financial analysts raced to downgrade LinkedIn, warning that the company\u2019s period of rapid growth was over. For example: RBC analysts said they had thought LinkedIn was on the cusp of \u201cfundamentally positive\u201d change. \u201cWe were wrong,\u201d they said in a client note. That helped to send LinkedIn\u2019s shares down around 40%, and laying the ground for Microsoft to strike a deal. Some big breaking news in the tech sector - Microsoft, the software giant, is buying business social network site LinkedIn for more than $26bn. The deal, just announced, values LinkedIn at $196 per share - or almost 50% above Friday night\u2019s close of $131. Here\u2019s the announcement. The deal comes five years after LinkedIn floated at $45 per share. But they were trading at $270 in 2015. More to follow..... While we wait for ICM to deliver their poll, let\u2019s hear a few words from George Osborne. The chancellor has just been interviewed by Bloomberg, and urged business leaders to back the Remain campaign. Osborne argues: \u201cPeople who are concerned or businesses who are concerned or investors who are concerned about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU should speak up. This is not the moment for businesses to sit it out.\u201d Some firms have already piled into the fray. Telecoms group BT has already written to its staff, explaining why it believes Britian should stay in the EU. But Sir James Dyson, the billionaire inventor, is backing the Leave campaign, and slamming warnings that Britain would be locked out of international markets. The US stock market is expected to dip when trading begins in 90 minutes time. That follows today\u2019s losses in Europe, and the big selloff in Asia overnight. ICM would like everyone to relax until they have finished working on their poll with, ummm, my colleague Tom Clark.... Hmmmm. No sign of that ICM Referendum poll yet. And its website has just crashed under the weight of web traffic looking for it.... City traders are bracing for fresh volatility, as polling company ICM is expected to release a new survey at 12.30pm BST. Another sign of European Brexit fears: Barings are also worried that Brussels would not cut Britain a generous deal if the public vote to leave the EU. They write: Post-Brexit concessions to the UK would send the wrong signal to other EU countries where nationalistic movements are growing. This could result in a political chain-reaction that could easily trigger a series of national referendums in numerous member countries. In terms of financial commitments, if the UK leaves the EU, it would save around \u00a310 billion in net contributions. The government would, however, be likely to need to step in to help sectors and regions which would stop receiving European structural funds, and which could be disproportionately affected by tariffs on trade. It is also not yet known what level of payment would be required to permit the UK business sector to access the 500 million people living in the EU. How badly could the pound be hit by a victory for Brexit campaigners? Well...economists at Barings Asset Management predict this morning that sterling could slump by a fifth! They point out that Britain is running a huge current account deficit, due to importing far more than it exports. It could widen further if Britain were to leave the single market, and be unable to sell services to the EU. And that would send the pound sliding hard, probably driving inflation sharply higher. Barings, who warn that Brexit would be likely to be highly damaging to the UK economy, explain: Practically, the mechanism through which capital flows will need to be attracted into the UK has to be through a cheaper sterling. There has not been an exact match for this event in the past, but previous times of stress have seen sterling depreciate by 15% to 20% on a trade-weighted basis. Research we have seen suggests that sterling could have to weaken by 25% to 30% in the event of Brexit, to continue to attract capital flows, slow imports and boost exports for the UK economy. However, sterling would not be alone. We would also expect the euro to decline in the uncertain aftermath of a vote in favour of Brexit, although sterling would be likely to be the weaker of the two. Of course, such profound currency depreciation would also have consequences for the UK economy. It would be highly inflationary. In turn, this would present the Bank of England with a particular dilemma; whether to raise interest rates to control inflation and risk slowing the UK economy, or do nothing, look through and see inflation rise by as much as 4% or 5%. Ironically, the London stock markets is suffering less of a selloff than the rest of Europe today. The FTSE is currently down 31 points, or 0.5%, while French stock are down a whopping 1.4%. And that\u2019s because analysts believe British companies will benefit from a weaker pound. It would make exporters more competitive, and boost earnings in foreign currencies. Pharmaceutical giant Glaxo and tobacco firms BAT and Imperial are thus among the risers today. Deutsche Bank analysts are advising buying London stocks, rather than the German equivalent. In the case of a Leave vote in the UK referendum (a scenario to which bookmakers\u2019 odds attribute a 30% probability), we expect UK equities to outperform the European market, given the likely depreciation of the pound in such a scenario as well as the market\u2019s defensive sector structure. However.... UK companies won\u2019t benefit if the Bank of England is forced to hike interest rates to prevent a sterling crisis. Brexit fears have rippled as far as Prague. The Czech Republic\u2019s main stock market has fallen 2% today, to its lowest level in seven years. And next week\u2019s EU referendum is, apparently, partly to blame. Analysts at Pekao, a Polish bank, told clients that: \u201cHigh probability of Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) remains the biggest short-term risk.\u201d The pound is hitting fresh two-month lows, as investors react to the tightening of the EU referendum race. Sterling is now down one cent against the US dollar at $1.4137, and more than eurocent against the euro at \u20ac1.254. And with stock markets still in the red, Joshua Mahony of firm IG says investors are worrying about Brexit, China\u2019s slowing economy and the possibility of US interest rate rises this year, Even if we manage to navigate the near term threats of a Brexit and a likely US rate hike, the continued slowdown in China will provide a remains a significant ongoing risk to global demand. It is clear that in a week which is relatively light on economic data, the focus will remain on the risk of a Brexit, which could destabilise not only the future of England, but also the European project as a whole. Reuters\u2019 Jemima Kelly flags up the latest odds: In another sign of global anxiety, Fitch has just cut the outlook on Japan\u2019s credit rating to negative, from stable. Fitch left Japan\u2019s rating at A (only the sixth-highest level), but warned that it is losing faith in its government\u2019s commitment to fiscal consolidation. Tokyo has just postponed plans to raise the sales tax, and could be forced into launching another stimulus package to spur growth. City firm ETX Capital believes there is a growing chance that Britain votes to leave the EU, given the latest polling. Joe Rundle, their head of trading, explains: Momentum is behind the Vote Leave camp as polls seem to show more support for Brexit than at any point in the campaign so far. We\u2019ve seen heavy selling and shortened our Brexit market price from over 80% - implying a one-in-five chance of Britain leaving the EU \u2013 to 66%, which indicates a one-in-three chance of Brexit. Betfair, the online gambling company, also reports that more money is being wagered on Brexit. It now estimates there is a 34% chance of the Leave campaign winning, based on betting patterns. Investors have also been dizzied by the flurry of opinion polls, which have shown the vote is tight: The cost of insuring against the pound tumbling against the euro over the next month has hit a record high this morning. Reuters explains: Euro/sterling one-month implied volatility, derived from an option that covers the June 23 referendum date and its aftermath, hit 26.3% according to Reuters data, exceeding the previous record of around 25% hit during the global financial crisis in 2008. The equivalent sterling/dollar one-month implied volatility also rocketed to 28.1%, close to its 2008 peak of around 29%. UK chip-maker ARM is the biggest faller in London this morning, along with financial stocks and miners. ARM is being hit by fears that a global downturn would hurt demand for its semiconductors, helping to drag the FTSE 100 down to a three-week low. UK banks are suffering from concerns over the EU vote, as Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: The markets got off to a dreadful start this Monday.... A healthy dose of drag from the Brexit-fearing banking stocks (especially Barclays and Lloyds) is adding to the FTSE 100\u2019s losses. With the referendum growing ever closer the pound is all set for an ugly week and a half, something immediately in evidence this morning. Cable [\u00a3/$] collapsed by another half a percent, leaving sterling at its lowest point against the dollar in 2 months, with a similar pattern occurring against the euro and a whole basket of currencies. This chart shows how the London stock market has dropped back to its recent lows: The London stock market is now at its lowest level since May 20. The FTSE 100 has lost 200 points since last Wednesday; today\u2019s selloff, plus the heavy losses on Thursday and Friday, have wiped out the gains of the last three weeks. As feared, European markets are falling at the start of trading. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has already shed 43 points, or 0.7%. There are deeper losses across the channel, with the French CAC down 1% and Germany\u2019s DAX losing 1.2%. Brexit is obviously a factor, as is new data showing Chinese investment growth hitting a 10-year low. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets says that \u201crisk aversion\u201d is rife this morning: Investors continue to fret over global growth with China weekend data failing to inspire and the IMF sounding the alarm (again) over a Chinese corporate debt bubble. Anxiety persists about the risks of a UK vote to leave the EU (Brexiety?) and traders prepare themselves for a hat-trick of central bank updates this week - from the US Federal Reserve (Wednesday), the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England (both on Thursday). The pound is sliding against other major currencies this morning, as worries about a possible Brexit take hold. Sterling hit a two-month low against the US dollar in early trading, losing 0.5% or 0.7 of a cent to $1.4182, a drop of 0.7 of a cent. This adds to Friday\u2019s tumble, which wiped two cents off the pound. Sterling has also hit a six-week low against the euro, at \u20ac1.2592, as traders bail out of sterling. Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, reckons the pound may drop further this week: \u201cAhead of the referendum, many look for sterling to underperform and the yen and Swiss franc to outperform,\u201d \u201cThe euro and central and eastern European currencies are vulnerable, while risk assets, in general, are expected to weaken on a Brexit victory,.\u201d Asian stock markets have already suffered chunky losses overnight, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei tumbling by 3.5%. Worries over the global economy, and Britain\u2019s EU referendum, also sent China\u2019s stock market down 2% and wiped almost 1% off the Australia market. Analysts at RBS Capital Markets say: The market opened in Asia in the same spirit as it closed on Friday: equity markets were under heavy pressure losing more than 2% across the board Money has poured into the Japanese yen, as investors flee shares and the pound in favour of safe-haven assets. That has hit Japan\u2019s exporters, who are already vulnerable to a slowdown in global growth. And investors expect more swings this week. Here\u2019s our latest story on the markets: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Hold onto your hats. Investors are starting the week in gloomy mood, which means we\u2019re going to see fresh falls on the European stock markets when trading begins. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares is expected to shed 1%, or 61 points, when the markets open. That adds to Friday\u2019s 116-point tumble, which wiped out around \u00a317bn of value. With Britain\u2019s EU referendum just 10 days away, traders are increasingly jump about the prospect of a Brexit. That\u2019s weighing on the pound, which is losing ground this morning as opinion polls show the race is still very close. The markets are also anxious about the state of the global economy, which looks bruised even without the shock of a Brexit. America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, meets to set interest rates this week. Few traders expect a hike at this meeting, but they are nervous that the Fed could still raise rates too quickly. Kit Juckes, currency expert at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, explains why the City is so jittery: If the global economy does not slide towards recession, the Fed will eventually raise rates (timidly). That\u2019s the best-case scenario, one in which oil-sensitive currencies can gain, but China-sensitive ones will struggle. The risk is that growth slows more sharply in China, causing capital to take fright. Pity the currencies of nations with big current account deficits then [such as the UK]. There are other dangers lurking too, like the UK referendum, the US presidential election and rising anti-European sentiment into the 2017 elections. So, lots to worry about today.....",

It could widen further if Britain were to leave the single market, and be unable to sell services to the EU.</p> <p>And that would send the pound sliding hard, probably driving inflation sharply higher. </p> <p>Barings, who warn that Brexit would be likely to be highly damaging to the UK economy, explain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Practically, the mechanism through which capital flows will need to be attracted into the UK has to be through a cheaper sterling. </p> <p>There has not been an exact match for this event in the past, but previous times of stress have seen sterling depreciate by 15% to 20% on a trade-weighted basis. Research we have seen suggests that sterling could have to weaken by 25% to 30% in the event of Brexit, to continue to attract capital flows, slow imports and boost exports for the UK economy.</p> <p>However, sterling would not be alone. We would also expect the euro to decline in the uncertain aftermath of a vote in favour of Brexit, although sterling would be likely to be the weaker of the two.</p> <p>Of course, such profound currency depreciation would also have consequences for the UK economy. It would be highly inflationary. In turn, this would present the Bank of England with a particular dilemma; whether to raise interest rates to control inflation and risk slowing the UK economy, or do nothing, look through and see inflation rise by as much as 4% or 5%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-13T10:16:36.675Z\">at 11.16am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-575e8109e4b064f52e5fa1fc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-13T09:59:24.508Z\">10.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Deutsche: London shares might benefit from Brexit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ironically, the London stock markets is suffering less of a selloff than the rest of Europe today.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE is currently down 31 points, or 0.5%, while French stock are down a whopping 1.4%.</p> <p>And that\u2019s because analysts believe British companies will benefit from a weaker pound.

Hoffman\u2019s new site, which aimed to let people build a professional online network and launched with help from former SocialNet colleagues, went live in 2003. LinkedIn lets people post a professional profile and establish business contacts. Most users do not pay for the service but the company earns revenue by charging premium subscriptions to recruiters and businesses. Hoffman was an early investor in Facebook in 2005 but he believed people would want a separate site to manage their professional lives and persevered with LinkedIn. He was LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive for four years before becoming chairman. Jeff Weiner, a former Yahoo executive, is chief executive. The company attracted capital from venture capital investors, starting in 2003 when Sequoia Capital took a stake. In 2008 Sequoia and other firms bought 5% for $53m, valuing LinkedIn at about $1bn. LinkedIn grew rapidly as the popularity of online networks increased in the noughties. The company floated on the New York stock exchange in 2011, valued at $4.3bn. Investors overlooked its regular losses in the hope of future returns from the trove of users and professional data that LinkedIn had amassed. Its shares more than doubled on the first day of trading as investors, hungry for the latest tech and digital media sucess story, appeared to banish all memory of the 2000 dotcom crash. LinkedIn has continued to attract members, growing from about 100 million when it floated, to more than 433 million in 200 countries now. The company, based in Mountain View, California, next to Google\u2019s base, has expanded rapidly outside the US, buying companies and hiring staff. Last year, LinkedIn\u2019s revenues were almost $3bn but it recorded a net loss of $166m. Most of its income is from the \u201ctalent solutions\u201d division, which charges recruiters to advertise jobs and use the company\u2019s data. But LinkedIn\u2019s rise has not been entirely smooth. The company\u2019s shares plunged by more than 40% on a single day in February, wiping out $11bn of market value after its revenue forecast fell well short of expectations. The fall was the shares\u2019 worst day since the flotation. More than 30 brokers downgraded their forecasts after LinkedIn said online ad revenue growth slowed to 20% in the fourth quarter of 2015 from 56% a year earlier. The reaction was accentuated by a gloomy US jobs report. Before Microsoft\u2019s acquisition was announced, LinkedIn shares were trading at $131, almost three times their $45 value at flotation, but down from a peak of $269 in February 2015.",

Let\u2019s pause for a moment to honour those who, whether for strictly ethical or reputational reasons, take that second route. Take That, for example, members of which have recently repaid more than \u00a320m to HMRC after investing in a scheme that allowed them to offset losses involved in a \u201cmusic investment\u201d plan against other taxable income. http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/take-pay-back-more-20million-8175524 In 2014, a judge ruled that the tax shelter Icebreaker, which Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen and their manager, Jonathan Wild, exploited (but not Robbie Williams or Jason Orange), was an avoidance scheme. \u201cWith a new team of accountants, we are working to settle things with all parties involved ASAP,\u201d Barlow said months later in a Twitter-based sorry stream. (Take That have declined to comment since the reported repayment.) Gabby Logan, the former gymnast and BBC Sport presenter, pulled out of the same scheme in 2012 and promised, in 2014, to pay back any money owed (we don\u2019t know how much). \u201cI have never hidden anything,\u201d she said in a statement when it was all exposed. Katie Melua held her hands up so enthusiastically after being named as one of the 1,000-plus investors in the scheme that she went so far as to praise the journalists who blew it open, adding: \u201cIf there is ambiguity in the law, then laws should be changed to disallow schemes like this, so that they would never be presented by legitimate tax experts to less experienced people like myself in the first place.\u201d She had invested \u00a3850,000 in the scheme, but said that she owes no more money. for his \u201cterrible error of judgment\u201d. http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/reformed-tax-avoider-jimmy-carr-paid-5081804 Corporate tax-avoiders tend to appear less chastened on the rare occasions that they do pop a little back into the public purse.

The firm struck a deal to pay back more than \u00a320m and last year paid corporation tax of \u00a38.1m, which was more than it owed \u2013 but only a touch less than the \u00a38.6m it paid over the 14 years before its change of heart. Of course, there are successful people who manage not to fall innocently and naively into such schemes. So a final shoutout to the tax angels who are proud to pay their dues from the off. They include JK Rowling, who in 2012 said: \u201cIt would have been contemptible to scarper for the West Indies at the first sniff of a seven-figure royalty cheque.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs bankers paid for prostitutes, private jets and five-star hotels and held business meetings on yachts to win business from a Libyan investment fund set up under Gaddafi regime, the high court in London was told yesterday. The allegations came at the start of a legal claim by the Libyan Investment Authority for $1.2bn (\u00a3846m) from the investment bank. Lawyers for the LIA are claiming for losses on nine trades that Goldman Sachs executed for the fund between January and April 2008. The LIA lost almost all its investment through the trades \u2013 one of which was the largest that the bank had undertaken in a single stock \u2013 while Goldman Sachs generated \u201ceyewatering\u201d profits of over more than $200m from the trades, Roger Masefield, a QC for LIA, said. The LIA, Masefield told the court, felt betrayed as the trades generated excessive profits for Goldman and were unsuitable for the LIA, which was staffed by individuals who had not been appointed on merit. Once the losses emerged, Masefield said one Libyan official described Goldman as the \u201cbank of mafiosa\u201d. The LIA was set up in 2006 to invest the country\u2019s oil wealth as its status from a pariah state was being lifted. Masefield said it was a nascent sovereign wealth fund with limited abilities to understand the so-called jumbo and elephant trades. Goldman is disputing the claim, which was filed in 2014, and its lawyers will address the court on Tuesday. But in documents outlining its defence the bank said that the proceedings were not brought until after the trades had matured. \u201cThe LIA was the victim of an unforeseen financial depression, not of any wrongdoing by [Goldman],\u201d the bank said. In documents provided to the court, the LIA cited Goldman Sachs describing the sovereign wealth fund as having \u201czero-level\u201d financial sophistication and one individual having \u201cdelivered a pitch on structured leveraged loans to someone who lives in the middle of the desert with his camels\u201d. Masefield told the court that one former Goldman executive \u2013 Youseff Kabbaj \u2013 had been told to \u201cstay a lot in Tripoli. It is important you stay super close to clients on a daily basis. Teach them, train them, dine them.\u201d Goldman agreed an internship for Haitem Zarti, the brother of Mustafa Zarti, the LIA\u2019s former deputy chief, which the LIA argues was intended to influence decisions by the investment fund. According to the skeleton argument presented to the court by the LIA: \u201cMr Kabbaj took Haitem Zarti on holidays to Morocco on various occasions. Mr Kabbaj also took him to Dubai for a conference, with the business class flights and five-star accommodation being paid by Goldman Sachs. Documents disclosed by Goldman Sachs show that during that drip Mr Kabbaj went so far as to arrange for a pair of prostitutes to entertain them both one evening.\u201d The LIA said the internship \u201chas been and may still be the subject of investigation\u201d by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. Goldman Sachs said it did not believe the internship influenced the LIA\u2019s decision to enter into the trades. \u201cThe claims are without merit and we will continue to defend them vigorously,\u201d it said. Kabbaj - who claimed \u00a322,000 for one trip - was not being called to give evidence for Goldman, Masefield said, reading out a settlement agreement between the bank and Kabbaj, who had been promised a $9m bonus by Goldman, but received $4.5m. The aim, Masefield argued, was intended to stop Kabbaj\u2019s concerns about the trades being aired. Bloomberg quoted an email from Kabbaj in which he said: \u201cGoldman Sachs or myself never paid for any LIA employee any improper entertainment...I am under a strong confidentiality agreement but I expect Goldman Sachs to correct the facts and protect my reputation\u201d. Masefield told the court that Driss Ben-Brahim \u2013 at the time a Goldman Sachs partner \u2013 in July 2007 met the LIA\u2019s Zarti on Saif Gaddafi\u2019s yacht in Cannes. Ben-Brahim wrote after the meeting that he was nervous about the relationship and wanted clearance from a more senior banker. Later, according to court documents, Goldman executives spent \u20ac25,800 \u2013 including contributions from their own pockets \u2013 to charter a private jet from the same company that Colonel Gaddafi used to travel to Tripoli. Nine trades \u2013 on banking companies Citigroup, Santander and UniCredit, French electricity company EDF, utility ENI and German insurer Allianz \u2013 are the subject of the case. The LIA argued that the case was one of of \u201cabuse of trust, undue influence and unconscionable bargain\u201d. It added: \u201cIt most emphatically is not, therefore, as Goldman Sachs would have it, one of little more than \u2018buyer\u2019s remorse\u2019; of a counterparty who like many others lost money as a result of the market crash in 2008 and now wants to rewind the clock.\u201d The case continues.",

      "body": "<p>Goldman Sachs bankers paid for prostitutes, private jets and five-star hotels and held business meetings on yachts to win business from a Libyan investment fund set up under Gaddafi regime, the high court in London was told yesterday.</p> <p>The allegations came at the start of a legal claim by the Libyan Investment Authority for $1.2bn (\u00a3846m) from the investment bank. Lawyers for the LIA are claiming for losses on nine trades that Goldman Sachs executed for the fund between January and April 2008.</p> <p>The LIA lost almost all its investment through the trades \u2013 one of which was the largest that the bank had undertaken in a single stock \u2013 while Goldman Sachs generated \u201ceyewatering\u201d profits of over more than $200m from the trades, Roger Masefield, a QC for LIA, said.<br></p> <p>The LIA, Masefield told the court, felt betrayed as the trades generated excessive profits for Goldman and were unsuitable for the LIA, which was staffed by individuals who had not been appointed on merit.</p> <p>Once the losses emerged, Masefield said one Libyan official described Goldman as the \u201cbank of mafiosa\u201d.</p> <p>The LIA was set up in 2006 to invest the country\u2019s oil wealth as its status from a pariah state was being lifted. Masefield said it was a nascent sovereign wealth fund with limited abilities to understand the so-called jumbo and elephant trades. </p> <p>Goldman is disputing the claim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/goldman-sachs-sued-libyan-fund\">which was filed in 2014</a>, and its lawyers will address the court on Tuesday. But in documents outlining its defence the bank said that the proceedings were not brought until after the trades had matured. \u201cThe LIA was the victim of an unforeseen financial depression, not of any wrongdoing by [Goldman],\u201d the bank said.</p> <p>In documents provided to the court, the LIA cited Goldman Sachs describing the sovereign wealth fund as having \u201czero-level\u201d financial sophistication and one individual having \u201cdelivered a pitch on structured leveraged loans to someone who lives in the middle of the desert with his camels\u201d.</p> <p>Masefield told the court that one former Goldman executive \u2013 Youseff Kabbaj \u2013 had been told to \u201cstay a lot in Tripoli. It is important you stay super close to clients on a daily basis. Teach them, train them, dine them.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p> Goldman agreed an internship for Haitem Zarti, the brother of Mustafa Zarti, the LIA\u2019s former deputy chief, which the LIA argues was intended to influence decisions by the investment fund. </p> <p>According to the skeleton argument presented to the court by the LIA: \u201cMr Kabbaj took Haitem Zarti on holidays to Morocco on various occasions. Mr Kabbaj also took him to Dubai for a conference, with the business class flights and five-star accommodation being paid by Goldman Sachs. Documents disclosed by Goldman Sachs show that during that drip Mr Kabbaj went so far as to arrange for a pair of prostitutes to entertain them both one evening.\u201d</p> <p> The LIA said the internship \u201chas been and may still be the subject of investigation\u201d by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs said it did not believe the internship influenced the LIA\u2019s decision to enter into the trades. \u201cThe claims are without merit and we will continue to defend them vigorously,\u201d it said. </p> <p>Kabbaj - who claimed \u00a322,000 for one trip - was not being called to give evidence for Goldman, Masefield said, reading out a settlement agreement between the bank and Kabbaj, who had been promised a $9m bonus by Goldman, but received $4.5m. The aim, Masefield argued, was intended to stop Kabbaj\u2019s concerns about the trades being aired. </p> <p>Bloomberg quoted an email from Kabbaj in which he said: \u201cGoldman Sachs or myself never paid for any LIA employee any improper entertainment...I am under a strong confidentiality agreement but I expect Goldman Sachs to correct the facts and protect my reputation\u201d.</p> <p>Masefield told the court that Driss Ben-Brahim \u2013 at the time a Goldman Sachs partner \u2013 in July 2007 met the LIA\u2019s Zarti on Saif Gaddafi\u2019s yacht in Cannes. Ben-Brahim wrote after the meeting that he was nervous about the relationship and wanted clearance from a more senior banker. Later, according to court documents, Goldman executives spent \u20ac25,800 \u2013 including contributions from their own pockets \u2013 to charter a private jet from the same company that Colonel Gaddafi used to travel to Tripoli.</p> <p>Nine trades \u2013 on banking companies Citigroup, Santander and UniCredit, French electricity company EDF, utility ENI and German insurer Allianz \u2013 are the subject of the case. </p> <p>The LIA argued that the case was one of of \u201cabuse of trust, undue influence and unconscionable bargain\u201d. </p> <p>It added: \u201cIt most emphatically is not, therefore, as Goldman Sachs would have it, one of little more than \u2018buyer\u2019s remorse\u2019; of a counterparty who like many others lost money as a result of the market crash in 2008 and now wants to rewind the clock.\u201d</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The property tycoons Nick and Christian Candy have been accused of tax evasion in the high court, in a fiercely contested legal battle that threatens to reveal the complex offshore structure that has sheltered profits from their sprawling real estate empire for a decade. The creators of the super-elite One Hyde Park complex near Harrods in Knightsbridge, west London, are being sued for damages by a rival businessman, Mark Holyoake, who is lifting the lid on their tax affairs in a \u00a3132m claim. Lawyers for Holyoake allege that Nick Candy, who is married to the pop star Holly Vallance, has been lying about the source of his wealth, and that the motive is tax evasion. They say Nick has been receiving secret dividends from his brother\u2019s Guernsey-based property development business, in the form of two London homes worth more than \u00a3200m and a series of loans and cash gifts. In a dramatic twist, emails were read out in court that the claimants say show Nick acting as a shadow director of his brother\u2019s firm. If the allegations are proven, Holyoake\u2019s lawyers say the brothers could face a bill for unpaid taxes from HM Revenue and Customs. Holyoake\u2019s barrister, Anthony Trace, said: \u201cWe claim that the financial position of Nick Candy is being falsely stated. It\u2019s all a matter of tax evasion.\u201d Holyoake is seeking damages, saying that after the defendants lent him about \u00a312m at short notice to purchase a property, he was bullied and coerced into further disadvantageous financial arrangements. The Candys deny making any threats of violence and describe all the accusations as \u201cuntrue, unsubstantiated and denied\u201d. They stress that Nick Candy is not and has never been an ultimate or other owner of his brother\u2019s Guernsey-based business, nor a director, employee or agent. They accuse Holyoake of defaulting on the loan and lying about his own assets, which he in turn denies. A spokesman said the brothers \u201chave an open relationship with HMRC, and have complied fully with all their UK tax obligations\u201d. A judge has yet to rule on the allegations made by both parties and the trial is not expected to begin until February 2017. The claims have emerged from a series of pre-trial hearings. At a hearing last week, Holyoake\u2019s request for a full, worldwide freezing order on the Candys\u2019 assets was rejected. He was refused leave to appeal and ordered to pay costs. In April, the brothers were ordered not to sell property over a certain value without giving notice to the court. Issuing the notification order, Mr Justice Nugee said: \u201cA person who publicly flaunts his wealth, but whose declared holdings in his corporate interests do not begin to justify the wealth which he displays, is open to the charge that he is willing to say one thing and do something else.\u201d Nugee questioned whether Nick Candy had cut all ties with the property development empire that he founded with his brother, Christian. Nugee said: \u201cThe public position which he and his brother have put forward that he has no interest in the property development business, and that his interests are in the interior decorating business represented by Candy &amp; Candy Holdings, may not tell the whole truth.\u201d Nick Candy has recently bought his wife a \u00a326m yacht. The running costs are claimed to be as high as \u00a32.6m a year. His properties are also mortgaged, and Trace said interest payments on the borrowings could run to several millions per year. Challenged to explain how Nick Candy, whose London-based interior decoration firm makes modest profits, was able to afford a billionaire lifestyle, the brothers have revealed a series of high-value transfers from Christian and his companies to Nick. In 2014, Nick received a two-floor penthouse at One Hyde Park, and the lease on Gordon House, a 200-year-old, grade II-listed mansion set in sweeping lawns in the grounds of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. Christian gave the house to his brother after paying \u00a375m for it in 2012. Christian Candy\u2019s lawyers told the court he had also made two payments worth a combined \u00a352m to his brother, from Candy businesses. These were described in court as a loan. There was also a \u00a310m cash gift. The brothers have shown the court deeds of gift to prove that the assets, which represent a substantial part of a combined fortune estimated at \u00a31.5bn in 2010, were given away. The claimants allege the transfers are not gifts but dividends, paid to Nick Candy by the Guernsey based property development business run by his brother. The pair\u2019s finances hinge on a decision taken a decade ago to split their business in two. Interior decoration and project management remained in the UK, overseen by Nick, who lives in London. The most lucrative element \u2013 developing and selling property \u2013 was moved offshore. It is run by Christian, through his Guernsey-based CPC Group, which was founded in 2004. For many years Christian was resident in Monaco, although his lawyer told the court he is now based in London. The arrangement has allowed CPC to legally avoid tax on the profits from \u00a32bn worth of sales at One Hyde Park. The development, which overlooks Harrods and the royal parks, came to symbolise the capture of London\u2019s trophy homes market by offshore investors after many of the flats were snapped up by screen companies. A former adviser to the brothers has decided to give evidence to support Holyoake\u2019s case. Emails between the Candys and the adviser, a Geneva-based former banker called William Pym, were read out to the court. Pym has also been employed by Holyoake, the court was told. The emails, sent in 2010, allegedly show Nick Candy issuing instructions for a CPC bank account, deciding whether to pay fees to an adviser, and being asked by one of its directors to approve the payment of fees. In one, Christian Candy allegedly describes his brother as a fellow director, saying: \u201cAll the directors, including Nick and I, are in Guernsey this Wednesday coming.\u201d Trace said: \u201cThere has now been, it\u2019s quite clear, a massive fraud on the court. The suggestion that Mr Nick Candy is not an owner or a director of CPC is nonsense. We strongly suspect that Mr Nick Candy does have 50% of CPC Group and that all of these payments are dividends in specie [in kind] from CPC.\u201d After the hearing, a spokesman for the Candys said that Holyoake\u2019s QC had \u201csought to make slanderous and entirely false allegations about the defendants\u2019 businesses and tax responsibilities, relying on the privilege of court to make them\u201d. \u201cThe judge dismissed the application for a freezing order without even needing to hear from CPC\u2019s lawyers, describing it as an \u2018abuse of the court\u2019s process\u2019. We consider this to be a further attempt by Mr Holyoake ... to force CPC Group into an early and unwarranted settlement. \u201cThere is little doubt Mr Holyoake will continue with these misguided and unwarranted attempts to extract money from CPC Group, Christian Candy and Nick Candy. We will seek and expect vindication through the courts.\u201d Because the dispute has yet to go to trial, there has been no ruling of fact by a judge, and the allegations made on both sides are claims and not fact. Court emails Emails read out in court show Nick Candy is still playing an active role in his brother\u2019s property development business, according to allegations made by lawyers for Holyoake, who is suing the Candy brothers for damages. The Candys say that Nick is not a director, employee, agent or beneficial owner of CPC. They say Holyoake has used court privilege to made \u201cslanderous and entirely false allegations about the defendants businesses and tax responsibilities\u201d. The emails in question were sent in 2010 between the Candy brothers and William Pym, a financial adviser in Geneva. From CPC\u2019s finance director, Tim Dean: \u201cI spoke to Nick and we are happy to proceed with a CPC account where the cash is deposited ...\u201d To William Pym, copied to Nick Candy: \u201cLet\u2019s resolve Bank of China on Monday and Nick and I will make a decision.\u201d From William Pym to Nick Candy: \u201cWe are all waiting for your OK to proceed.\u201d From CPC\u2019s director, Steven Smith, to Nick Candy: \u201cI am ready to go with the docs once you approve the fees.\u201d From Nick Candy to William Pym: \u201cWilliam, I have spoken to Chris and I don\u2019t think CPC should pay any fees \u2026 CPC will not pay any fees.\u201d From Nick Candy to William Pym: \u201cWilliam, we have three other banks that have already given us terms ... When am I meeting the top guy?\u201d From Christian Candy to William Pym, copied to Nick Candy: \u201cHi William. All the directors including Nick and I are in Guernsey this Wednesday coming.\u201d From William Pym to Nick Candy and Christian Candy: \u201cDear Nick and Chris, I just wanted to update you on where we are with regards to your funding request for One Hyde Park\u201d... [X] and myself have now met with the new CEO of BOC [Bank of China] Switzerland. He is extremely keen to develop the CPC relationship ... CPC as a result have now been pushed to the top of the pile.\u201d",

Pym has also been employed by Holyoake, the court was told.</p> <p>The emails, sent in 2010, allegedly show Nick Candy issuing instructions for a CPC bank account, deciding whether to pay fees to an adviser, and being asked by one of its directors to approve the payment of fees.</p> <p>In one, Christian Candy allegedly describes his brother as a fellow director, saying: \u201cAll the directors, including Nick and I, are in Guernsey this Wednesday coming.\u201d </p> <p>Trace said: \u201cThere has now been, it\u2019s quite clear, a massive fraud on the court. The suggestion that Mr Nick Candy is not an owner or a director of CPC is nonsense. We strongly suspect that Mr Nick Candy does have 50% of CPC Group and that all of these payments are dividends in specie [in kind] from CPC.\u201d</p> <p>After the hearing, a spokesman for the Candys said that Holyoake\u2019s QC had \u201csought to make slanderous and entirely false allegations about the defendants\u2019 businesses and tax responsibilities, relying on the privilege of court to make them\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe judge dismissed the application for a freezing order without even needing to hear from CPC\u2019s lawyers, describing it as an \u2018abuse of the court\u2019s process\u2019. We consider this to be a further attempt by Mr Holyoake ... to force CPC Group into an early and unwarranted settlement. </p> <p>\u201cThere is little doubt Mr Holyoake will continue with these misguided and unwarranted attempts to extract money from CPC Group, Christian Candy and Nick Candy. We will seek and expect vindication through the courts.\u201d</p> <p>Because the dispute has yet to go to trial, there has been no ruling of fact by a judge, and the allegations made on both sides are claims and not fact.</p> <h2>Court emails</h2> <p>Emails read out in court show Nick Candy is still playing an active role in his brother\u2019s property development business, according to allegations made by lawyers for Holyoake, who is suing the Candy brothers for damages.</p> <p>The Candys say that Nick is not a director, employee, agent or beneficial owner of CPC. They say Holyoake has used court privilege to made \u201cslanderous and entirely false allegations about the defendants businesses and tax responsibilities\u201d. </p> <p>The emails in question were sent in 2010 between the Candy brothers and William Pym, a financial adviser in Geneva.</p> <p>From CPC\u2019s finance director, Tim Dean: \u201cI spoke to Nick and we are happy to proceed with a CPC account where the cash is deposited ...\u201d</p> <p>To William Pym, copied to Nick Candy: \u201cLet\u2019s resolve Bank of China on Monday and Nick and I will make a decision.\u201d</p> <p>From William Pym to Nick Candy: \u201cWe are all waiting for your OK to proceed.\u201d</p> <p>From CPC\u2019s director, Steven Smith, to Nick Candy: \u201cI am ready to go with the docs once you approve the fees.\u201d</p> <p>From Nick Candy to William Pym: \u201cWilliam, I have spoken to Chris and I don\u2019t think CPC should pay any fees \u2026 CPC will not pay any fees.\u201d</p> <p>From Nick Candy to William Pym: \u201cWilliam, we have three other banks that have already given us terms ... When am I meeting the top guy?\u201d</p> <p>From Christian Candy to William Pym, copied to Nick Candy: \u201cHi William. All the directors including Nick and I are in Guernsey this Wednesday coming.\u201d</p> <p>From William Pym to Nick Candy and Christian Candy: \u201cDear Nick and Chris, I just wanted to update you on where we are with regards to your funding request for One Hyde Park\u201d... [X] and myself have now met with the new CEO of BOC [Bank of China] Switzerland. He is extremely keen to develop the CPC relationship ... CPC as a result have now been pushed to the top of the pile.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Asda has replaced its chief executive in an attempt to reverse a long run of falling sales at the supermarket amid intense competition between food retailers. Walmart, Asda\u2019s US owner, said Andy Clarke will be replaced by Sean Clarke, a former Asda employee who most recently ran Walmart\u2019s Chinese business. Andy Clarke has worked for Asda for more than 20 years and has run the business since 2010. He will work at Asda until the end of July and act as an adviser to Britain\u2019s third-biggest supermarket until the end of the year. Asda has been the main casualty of the supermarket price war as customers defect to rivals such as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Walmart said last month that price cuts had failed to stop sales falling for the seventh quarterly period in a row as shoppers opted to shop in rivals\u2019 smaller shops instead of Asda\u2019s large stores. Andy Clarke launched a plan called \u201cproject renewal\u201d to revive the business in October, including cutting prices, refurbishing big stores, scrapping products and shelving expansion plans. Asda announced 750 job cuts in stores and its head office in March and said it would close staff canteens to cut costs. Asda also opted out of the pre-Christmas Black Friday discount bonanza to protect profit margins and hired the TV chef James Martin to appear in advertisements. Pressure grew on Clarke as trading failed to show a turnaround from a worst-ever quarterly sales fall, recorded during the period over Christmas. The competition watchdog also criticised Asda in April for offering deals that could mislead shoppers. Asda recruited Roger Burnley, Sainsbury\u2019s operations head, last October and some analysts expected the former Asda man to replace Clarke once his year-long notice period from Sainsbury\u2019s was over. Burnley will become deputy chief executive of Asda when he arrives in October. Walmart said: \u201cAndy Clarke has decided the timing is right to step aside from his role with the company. Sean\u2019s leadership will allow Asda to build upon the momentum of project renewal and reposition the business in a very competitive market place.\u201d Sean Clarke started his retail career at Asda in 1996 and worked for Walmart in Japan and Canada before running the Chinese operation of America\u2019s biggest retailer. He will take over at Asda on 11 July. He said: \u201cRejoining Asda at such a critical point in the development of the UK retail market is both a challenge and a privilege. After spending the last 15 years in Walmart\u2019s global retail markets, I\u2019m looking forward to returning to the business that got me hooked on grocery retail.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Neil Woodford, one of Britain\u2019s top investors, has spent \u00a311.6m to take his stake to more than 20% in Imperial Innovations, an offshoot of Imperial College London that funds and licenses scientific research. Imperial Innovations sold shares to investors in February to raise \u00a3100m to support existing investments. Woodford\u2019s fund has received approval from the Financial Conduct Authority to own 20% or more of the shares as agreed at the time of the placing, Imperial Innovations said. Woodford Investment Management\u2019s stake will rise to 21% from 19.9%. The company started in 1986 to exploit commercial opportunities from research at Imperial College, which specialises in science, engineering, medicine and business. It has an agreement with Imperial College until 2020 and also backs research from University College London (UCL), Oxford and Cambridge. Imperial Innovations sold shares on the alternative investment market (Aim) in 2006 and has raised additional funds every few years since. The value of its investments rose by \u00a327.9m to \u00a3355.1m at 31 January from a year earlier. The company has traditionally aimed its investment at health research but is branching out into technology. Early this year it signed a deal with the UCL technology fund and helped set up Apollo Therapeutics, a tie-up between GlaxoSmithKline and other drugs companies and Imperial College, UCL and Cambridge to speed up development of medicines. Woodford, whose decisions are closely watched by retail investors, is known for taking stakes in companies based on what he sees as enduring trends instead of trading on short-term events or fads. He has taken stakes in several healthcare and pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca. When Woodford launched Woodford Investment Management two years ago after 25 years at Invesco Perpetual he said he wanted to back British science with long-term funding. His fund is based in Oxford rather than the City of London or Mayfair. \u201cNo other country matches Britain in its track record of scientific discovery. We do science and innovation incredibly well, but we have a lamentable record in converting top science into top businesses,\u201d he said. Imperial Innovations shares rose 2.2% to 435p. This article was corrected to show that Woodford Investment Management\u2019s stake in Imperial Innovations had risen above 20% and that it had not bought a 20% stake.",

It has an agreement with Imperial College until 2020 and also backs research from University College London (UCL), Oxford and Cambridge.</p> <p>Imperial Innovations sold shares on the alternative investment market (Aim) in 2006 and has raised additional funds every few years since. The value of its investments rose by \u00a327.9m to \u00a3355.1m at 31 January from a year earlier.<br></p> <p>The company has traditionally aimed its investment at health research but is branching out into technology. Early this year it signed a deal with the UCL technology fund and helped set up Apollo Therapeutics, a tie-up between GlaxoSmithKline and other drugs companies and Imperial College, UCL and Cambridge to speed up development of medicines.</p> <p>Woodford, whose decisions are closely watched by retail investors, is known for taking stakes in companies based on what he sees as enduring trends instead of trading on short-term events or fads. He has taken stakes in several healthcare and pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca.</p> <p>When Woodford launched <a href=\"https://woodfordfunds.com/\">Woodford Investment Management</a> two years ago after 25 years at Invesco Perpetual <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/may/24/neil-woodford-new-fund-british-science\">he said he wanted to back British science</a> with long-term funding. His fund is based in Oxford rather than the City of London or Mayfair.</p> <p>\u201cNo other country matches Britain in its track record of scientific discovery. We do science and innovation incredibly well, but we have a lamentable record in converting top science into top businesses,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Imperial Innovations shares rose 2.2% to 435p.</p> <ul> <li>This article was corrected to show that Woodford Investment Management\u2019s stake in Imperial Innovations had risen above 20% and that it had not bought a 20% stake.<br></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in G4S have fallen heavily after the UK security services company said Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was an employee. G4S, the world\u2019s biggest security firm, said it had employed Mateen since September 2007 and that he was off duty when he carried out the deadliest mass shooting in US history on Sunday morning. The company carried out detailed screenings on Mateen when he was employed and again as recently as 2013 \u201cwith no adverse findings\u201d, G4S said in a statement. He had been working at a residential community in South Florida. Mateen was interviewed three times by the FBI in 2013 and 2014 following separate reports of extremist behaviour and connections to terrorism that were ultimately judged to be insubstantial. G4S said: \u201cHe was also subject to checks by a US law enforcement agency with no findings reported to G4S. G4S is providing its full support to all law enforcement authorities in the USA as they conduct their investigations.\u201d In a statement, John Kenning, G4S\u2019s North America chief executive, said: \u201cWe are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the friends, families and people affected by this unspeakable tragedy.\u201d G4S said Mateen was an armed security officer and that it was trying to establish whether weapons used in the attack on the Pulse gay nightclub were related to his work. The company supplies its armed employees with guns in the US and does not allow them to use their own. G4S shares dropped by as much as 7.5% and were the biggest fallers among leading UK shares. The company employs 620,000 people in more than 110 countries and the US is one of its biggest markets. Jasper Lawler, an analyst at CMC Markets, a City spread betting firm, said it did not look good for G4S to have employed Mateen while he was being investigated by the FBI. \u201cG4S has more than 50,000 employees in the US, a large proportion of which are involved in government contracts. If the name of G4S starts getting dragged through the mud, US contracts may become harder to come by.\u201d The company, whose activities range from supplying bodyguards and guarding buildings to running prisons and clearing mines, has been dogged by controversy. Two years ago it agreed to repay the UK government \u00a3109m after it overcharged for the electronic tagging of offenders. Three G4S security guards were acquitted of manslaughter charges in 2014 concerning the death of a man from a cardiac arrest on a flight from London. Jimmy Mubenga was being deported back to Angola. Human rights groups have also criticised G4S for providing services to Israeli prisons holding Palestinian detainees. In 2014, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said it had sold its stake in G4S.",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares have started the week on a downbeat note, as the cocktail of concerns gripping markets over the past few days shows little sign of easing. More disappointing Chinese data, with industrial production and retail sales both below expectations, renewed worries about the state of the global economy. Investors are also cautious ahead of the latest meetings from the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and Bank of England, both of whom are widely expected to stick to the status quo. But there is enough uncertainty to keep markets on their toes. And on top of that there is the prospect of Brexit, with a number of polls putting the Leave campaign ahead. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: [EU referendum] polls show it\u2019s now too close to call and markets are responding with some very twitchy activity. Sterling has shed more than 2% in two sessions to retrace its April lows, while implied one-month volatility for cable [pound/dollar] is at its highest since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008. Stocks across Europe are in negative territory and it\u2019s hard to see much upside until next Thursday\u2019s referendum produces a result. And with the weak Chinese data reviving growth fears, oil has moved lower and put more pressure on commodity companies. A surging yen as investors seek havens for their cash is also putting pressure on Japanese exporters. So the FTSE 100, although off its worst levels, is still down 23.02 points at 6092.74. Banks are among the fallers on Brexit and low interest rate worries, with Lloyds Banking Group 1.38p lower at 65.67p and Barclays down 3p at 166.4p. But Royal Bank of Scotland has bucked the trend, up 1.5p at 215.4p. Sky has dropped 20p to 905.5p as Barclays reduced its target price from \u00a311.25 to \u00a311 and Citigroup cut from \u00a314 to \u00a313.50. Arm, the chip designer, has lost 23.5p to 942.5p on concerns about a slowdown in the smartphone market following weakness in Asia, and ahead of Apple\u2019s annual developers conference in San Francisco. It was also hit by a sell note from Liberum, who said: We believe Arm may see further royalty softness this year but that it has flexibility to use its licensing backlog to offset this. However, this flexibility is likely to diminish in 2017 if the backlog continues to decline. We therefore view the acceleration in revenue growth that consensus models in 2017 as unlikely. The tailwind from higher royalty in smartphones eases in 2016 and new markets (networking) are unlikely to become material before 2018+. We are 8% below consensus earnings per share in 2017 rising to 22% by 2020. But Inmarsat, which is due to be relegated from the FTSE 100 at the end of this week, is currently the top riser in the leading index. Its shares have climbed 18p to 721.5p as it unveiled a partnership with broadband specialist SpeedCast to use the group\u2019s Fleet Xpress service for its maritime business, rolling it out to 2,000 vessels. Inmarsat chief executive Rupert Pearce said: This is a very important strategic alliance for Inmarsat. [It] deepends our valuable partnership and ... also significantly strengthens Inmarsat\u2019s position in the global maritime business.",
