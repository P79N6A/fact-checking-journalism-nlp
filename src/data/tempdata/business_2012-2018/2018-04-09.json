      "bodyText": "The UK should not prioritise making trade deals around the world at the expense of maintaining close ties with the European Union following Brexit, the government has been warned. The Institute of Directors, one of the country\u2019s top business lobby groups with more than 30,000 members, said ministers would need to boost trade with both the EU and the rest of the world to make their \u201cglobal Britain\u201d ambitions a reality. It comes as Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, looks to strike more trade deals with the rest of the world \u2013 seen as one of the key reasons among prominent Brexiters for leaving the EU. However, polling of almost 800 company directors by the IoD found the EU has provided stronger growth for British firms selling goods overseas than Asia or North America over the past two years. Business leaders see potential in these regions in the next five years, according to the poll, but the EU remains the area with the highest expectations for growth. More than two out of five company bosses found most business growth in the EU, compared with one in five citing North America or Asia. Two thirds of those polled exported goods, up by 7% on 2013. Allie Renison of the IoD warned ministers to \u201cget real about trade, and fast\u201d as the statistics showed how important the EU was for British firms. \u201cGoing global is as much about opportunities in Europe as it is further afield, and this should be reflected in how the government shapes post-Brexit Britain,\u201d she said. A separate study found that three out of four companies are optimistic about their international business prospects. A survey of more than 6,000 firms by HSBC showed mixed feeling about the impact of Brexit, with 38% saying it will be negative, while a third predicted it would be positive. Amanda Murphy, the head of commercial banking for HSBC UK, said: \u201cUndeterred by future post-EU uncertainty, businesses clearly aim to capitalise on the cheaper pound and rising demand in key markets to boost their overseas sales.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The strong employment growth of last year should continue for some time in light of the continued growth of job vacancies. But while overall the opportunities are better now for those looking for work than have been for some time, the picture remains extremely varied, depending on where you live and what type of work you are looking to do. Last year certainly was a good year from employment. Over the year, total employment grew by 3.4% \u2013 the best annual growth since September 2005, and the number of hours worked grew by 3%, the best since 2010. And while the growth levels do seem to have come off their peak a bit in the start of this year, employment is still growing very solidly: And generally the signs are good for this employment growth continuing, with the latest job vacancy figures showing a 4.4% increase in private sector vacancies in February compared with the three months to November last year: Again this is showing a slight fall from the peak quarterly growth of 5.3% that we had in the middle of last year, but it remains extremely solid \u2013 and marks now 18 consecutive quarters of growth, which breaks the previous record by a year. Of course the number and growth of job vacancies does not tell us everything \u2013 especially if the size of the labour force is growing faster. This is why economists use the \u201cjob vacancy rate,\u201d which measures the number of vacancies as a percentage of the labour force. On this score again things are very good \u2013 in fact better than ever. In February, the vacancy rate was a record 1.7% \u2013 higher than even at the peak of the mining boom: And this good figure is also reflected in the number of unemployed per vacancy. In February there was, on average across the nation, just 3.3 unemployed per vacancy \u2013 the lowest rate since May 2011. And while underemployment remains at near record levels, even if we include those workers (always a bit perilous given being underemployed does not mean you are looking for a job, you may merely wish to get more hours in the job you are currently doing) the level of underutilised workers per job vacancy is 8.3 \u2013 the lowest for six years: Now yes, a national average is all well and good, but if you live in Adelaide, you\u2019re not very likely going to be answering a job advert in Brisbane. Across each state, New South Wales, Victoria, the ACT and Northern Territory are all performing better than the national average. But while in NSW there are just 2.8 unemployed per vacancy, in South Australia there are 5.9 \u2013 the highest in the nation: But even South Australia is doing better now than it was five years ago \u2013 as are most states. Queensland hasn\u2019t seen much improvement, and in Western Australia the end of the mining boom continues to bite. When the mining boom was in full swing there were just 1.2 unemployed per vacancy in the WA, now there are 4.3: But a case could be made that given the current level of job vacancies, that the unemployment rate should be lower. Economists compare the vacancy rate with the unemployment to gauge how well the labour market is clearing unemployed. Generally the higher the vacancy rate \u2013 ie the more vacancies per people in the labour force, the lower the unemployment rate should be because it is easier to find work. This relationship (known as the Beveridge curve) has held up well over the past 40 years, but at the moment it seems things are a bit \u201csticky\u201d to use the economic term: Given the current vacancy rate, you would expect the unemployment rate to be much lower \u2013 nearer 4%. And it is here that we see the continued issues of our changing economy. While the Bureau of Statistics does provide a breakdown of vacancies by industry, the department of jobs\u2019 monthly vacancy report breaks down the vacancies by occupation. Since the end of 2016, when the nice boom in employment began, the biggest growth in job vacancies have been for professionals. This in itself is not surprising \u2013 professionals make up the biggest chunk of all employed \u2013 some 24% of all workers. But the growth in job vacancies has greatly outpaced the number of people working in those occupations. Vacancies for professionals accounted for 35% of the growth in all vacancies since December 2016: By contrast, labourers, sales persons, and community and personal service workers have all been occupations where the growth in vacancies is below what would be expected given the level of people employed in such work. The situation for labourers is quite stark. In 2007, labourer jobs accounted for 11% of all vacancies and for 11% of all employed. Now they account for 10% of all employed but just 6.4% of all vacancies: The economy is very much moving towards both a services sector, but also a more educated/skills-orientated workforce. That means that for some, in some parts of the nation, opportunities are as good now as ever before. But for others, the risks of being left behind are greater than in the past. That means the need for improving the skills and education of those looking for work \u2013 and for those about to enter the labour force \u2013 remains paramount.

      "bodyText": "In Ready Player One, Steven Spielberg\u2019s latest blockbuster, much of the population of a desolate future America have abandoned the world of work for the virtual reality of gaming in a software program called the Oasis. A report from the International Monetary Fund on Monday suggests it\u2019s perhaps not such a fanciful future after all. The rather more sober, official title of the IMF report is Labor Force Participation in Advanced Economies: Drivers and Prospects. What it reveals is a sharp and still barely understood divergence between Europe and the US, especially since the 2008 financial crisis. The number of women in the workforce in Europe has been rising strongly, said the IMF. But in a \u201cstriking difference\u201d the trend has gone into reverse in the US. Meanwhile, jobs for \u201cprime-age men\u201d have stagnated or dropped back a bit in Europe, but in the US the decline has been far more serious. \u201cThe reason that US prime-age men and youth became so much more disconnected from the labor market than their European counterparts remains puzzling,\u201d said the IMF. But it does offer some hypotheses although not endorsing any; opioid use, rising disability and higher incarceration rates in the US all get a mention. But it also points to a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research which concluded that young males are dropping out of the workforce to play video games instead. Social gaming \u2013 where players connect with others across the internet \u2013 took off with World of Warcraft in 2004, and since then the researchers say they have found a direct correlation with reduced labour force participation. How do these young men support themselves if they\u2019re not working? They don\u2019t \u2013 many more just live with their parents. A generation sinking into gaming is not the only troubling feature of this IMF report. It charts the overall decline in US labour participation, particularly pronounced in the mid-west states, but stretching to the coasts as well, with New York the only major metropolitan area to buck the trend. None of this can be read without reference to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and the escalating tariff and trade wars. The IMF acknowledges that workers in manufacturing earn around 30% more than the service sector jobs many are dumped into when production goes offshore. But Trump\u2019s prescription for making America great again \u2013 by reshoring manufacturing jobs from Asia \u2013 is fraught with danger. Very few advanced economies have increased manufacturing output as a share of total GDP since 1960 (Ireland by the most), yet every single one has still seen jobs in manufacturing decline. And the only major economy to lose more manufacturing jobs than either Britain or the US since 1960? Step forward Hong Kong. House prices: the out-of-touch commentators The surprise spike in the Halifax house price index \u2013 up 1.5% in March, the biggest rise for six months \u2013 wrong-footed many economists who are predicting a flat 2018. But it brought joy to estate agents everywhere. \u201cThese numbers represent an impressive sprint finish for the first quarter,\u201d said the James Pendleton agency. \u201cThis is an enormous rebound ... Any Brexit fears seem to have abated for the time being,\u201d said House Simple, another agency. Meanwhile at Garrington Property Finders they opined that \u201cAfter February\u2019s freeze, the March thaw brought some relief to the property market.\u201d Joy? Relief? For whom? That 1.5% gain in March alone meant that the average house price in the UK reached an all-time high of \u00a3227,871, or around nine times average incomes. The only real joy that has emerged from the UK property market in recent months is how prices have stumbled in London, dropping from completely crazed to somewhere just a tiny fraction below totally idiotic.

A report from the International Monetary Fund on Monday suggests it\u2019s perhaps not such a fanciful future after all.</p> <p>The rather more sober, official title of the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2018/03/20/world-economic-outlook-april-2018\">IMF report</a> is Labor Force Participation in Advanced Economies: Drivers and Prospects. What it reveals is a sharp and still barely understood divergence between Europe and the US, especially since the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>The number of women in the workforce in Europe has been rising strongly, said the IMF. But in a \u201cstriking difference\u201d the trend has gone into reverse in the US. Meanwhile, jobs for \u201cprime-age men\u201d have stagnated or dropped back a bit in Europe, but in the US the decline has been far more serious.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason that US prime-age men and youth became so much more disconnected from the labor market than their European counterparts remains puzzling,\u201d said the IMF.</p> <p>But it does offer some hypotheses although not endorsing any; opioid use, rising disability and higher incarceration rates in the US all get a mention. But it also points to <a href=\"https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/maguiar/files/leisure-luxuries-labor-june-2017.pdf\">a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research</a> which concluded that young males are dropping out of the workforce to play video games instead.</p> <p>Social gaming \u2013 where players connect with others across the internet \u2013 took off with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/02/warcraft-film-china-blockbuster-hollywood-investment\">World of Warcraft</a> in 2004, and since then the researchers say they have found a direct correlation with reduced labour force participation. How do these young men support themselves if they\u2019re not working? They don\u2019t \u2013 many more just live with their parents.</p> <p>A generation sinking into gaming is not the only troubling feature of this IMF report. It charts the overall decline in US labour participation, particularly pronounced in the mid-west states, but stretching to the coasts as well, with New York the only major metropolitan area to buck the trend. </p> <p>None of this can be read without reference to Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and the escalating tariff and trade wars. The IMF acknowledges that workers in manufacturing earn around 30% more than the service sector jobs many are dumped into when production goes offshore. But Trump\u2019s prescription for making America great again \u2013 by reshoring manufacturing jobs from Asia \u2013 is fraught with danger. Very few advanced economies have increased manufacturing output as a share of total GDP since 1960 (Ireland by the most), yet every single one has still seen jobs in manufacturing decline. And the only major economy to lose more manufacturing jobs than either Britain or the US since 1960? Step forward Hong Kong. </p> <h2>House prices: the out-of-touch commentators<br></h2> <p>The surprise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/09/uk-march-house-prices-post-biggest-monthly-increase-for-six-months\">spike in the Halifax house price index</a> \u2013 up 1.5% in March, the biggest rise for six months \u2013 wrong-footed many economists who are predicting a flat 2018. But it brought joy to estate agents everywhere. \u201cThese numbers represent an impressive sprint finish for the first quarter,\u201d said the James Pendleton agency. \u201cThis is an enormous rebound ... Any Brexit fears seem to have abated for the time being,\u201d said House Simple, another agency. Meanwhile at Garrington Property Finders they opined that \u201cAfter February\u2019s freeze, the March thaw brought some relief to the property market.\u201d </p> <p>Joy? Relief? For whom? That 1.5% gain in March alone meant that the average house price in the UK reached an all-time high of \u00a3227,871, or around nine times average incomes. <br></p> <p>The only real joy that has emerged from the UK property market in recent months is how prices have stumbled in London, dropping from completely crazed to somewhere just a tiny fraction below totally idiotic. The hope must be that the London falls will radiate out of the capital across the country. If we are to see yet another UK house market surge, at the very time that the economy is mired in Brexit uncertainty, and when personal debt levels are calamitously high, then there really is no hope for young people. Maybe there\u2019s a rationality to all that time spent playing World of Warcraft instead. </p> <p>But the reality is that this spike in house prices is unlikely to persist for long.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has said advanced economies such as Britain, the US and Japan risk being overwhelmed by their ageing populations, and calls on them to throw open their borders to more migrant workers in response. Within the next few decades, working-age adults will need to support double the number of elderly people than they do now, putting immense pressure on welfare systems and wiping out as much as 3% of potential economic output by 2050, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook report. The Fund\u2019s comments come as the number of migrant workers arriving in Britain from Europe is already in sharp decline following the Brexit vote almost two years ago, and as populist parties in many western countries push their governments to curb immigration. The analytical chapters of its report, published on Monday, said: \u201cDramatic shifts in demographic structure projected in advanced economies could overwhelm the ability of policies to offset the forces of ageing. \u201c[This] underscores the need to rethink migration policies to boost labor supply in advanced economies.\u201d Without government intervention, the IMF said the current labour force participation rate, which estimates the number of people eligible for work who are in employment, could fall by as much as 5.5% on average across advanced economies over the next 30 years. Net annual migration of EU nationals to Britain fell by 75,000 in the year to September, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, hitting the lowest level for five years. Company bosses have raised growing concerns about labour shortages as a result. Without more doctors and nurses from abroad, there are also fears that the NHS could increasingly struggle to cope with the rising demands posed by an ageing population. The government\u2019s own economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, estimates healthcare spending in the UK will need to almost double from 6.9% of GDP in the early 2020s to 12.6% by the mid-2060s because of the demographic shift. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates the public purse will be out of pocket by about \u00a3160bn by the mid-2060s as the number of people over 65 grows by almost a third, while the working age population is expected to only increase by about 2%. The IMF said governments could attempt to counter the demographic timebomb through better policies to help people balance family life with work. It also called for more investment in education to get people into work and boost their chances of staying in a job longer. There have been steady increases in the number of women entering the workforce in recent decades, as shifting cultural norms and government policies encourage them to stay in work after childbirth and for longer into their careers. The IMF said for the median advanced economy, the female labour force participation rate had increased by close to 10% since 1985. It said, however, that more women and older workers alone may not be enough for economies to solve the problem. It said labour market participation would still eventually decline even if gender gaps are fully closed, and that it was also likely to remain below current levels even if more older people stay in work for longer. \u201cUnless technology delivers offsetting productivity gains, these findings highlight the need for many advanced economies to rethink immigration policies to boost their labor supply, alongside policies to encourage older workers to postpone retirement,\u201d it said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Trump administration\u2019s new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and top government officials began to bite on Monday as the rouble suffered its biggest daily fall in more than three years, the main Russian stock index slumped and investors dumped shares in businesses controlled by Oleg Deripaska. Russia\u2019s currency briefly dipped more than 4% before recovering slightly to trade at 60.42 to the dollar on Monday evening, down 3.8%, its biggest daily percentage fall since January 2015. The value of Deripaska\u2019s aluminium producer Rusal halved in Hong Kong and more than 40% was wiped off the value of his London-listed EN+ as investors took fright at the potential impact. Shares in Rusal and EN+ had already fallen sharply on Friday in response to the sanctions, which were announced towards the end of trading in London. The Russian stock market also fell heavily. The main RTS index dropped 11%, affecting companies not caught by the sanctions. The price of aluminium jumped as traders worried Rusal would be excluded from supplying the market. The firm, which produces almost 6% of the world\u2019s aluminium, said the sanctions could cause technical defaults on bank loans and some credit obligations. Both Rusal and EN+, Deripaska\u2019s holding company, said the sanctions could be \u201cmaterially adverse to the business and prospects\u201d of the companies. Rusal and seven other companies linked to Deripaska were the main targets when the US imposed sanctions designed to punish Vladimir Putin\u2019s inner circle for \u201cmalign activity\u201d, including support for Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government in Syria and interfering with the US election in 2016. Rusal sells more than 10% of its aluminium to the US. The sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in US jurisdictions and bar Americans from doing business with them. By making it virtually impossible for Deripaska\u2019s businesses to trade in US dollars, the measures threaten the empire of one of Putin\u2019s closest allies. The sanctions could also threaten a tentative revival in Russia\u2019s economy, which had only just started to recover from those imposed in response to its annexation of Crimea in 2014. The latest sanctions affected companies such as Sberbank, whose shares fell 17% in Moscow. The state-controlled bank is seen as a barometer for the wider Russian economy. Evraz, the steel company controlled by the Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, was the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, dropping almost 15%. Polymetal, a Russian miner listed in London, was the biggest FTSE 250 faller, down 18%. Concerns also spread to Glencore, the FTSE 100-listed mining and energy giant. Glencore is one of Rusal\u2019s biggest investors and buyers of its aluminium, and its chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, sits on the Rusal board. Glencore shares fell 3.4% to a four-month low. EN+ said its annual report might be delayed and that its independent director, Dominique Fraisse, had quit on Friday after less than four months in the job. The company floated its shares in London in November, raising $1bn (\u00a3710m), despite concerns that it could face sanctions related to Deripaska\u2019s ties to Putin. Deripaska, whose wealth Forbes magazine estimates at $6.7bn, meets Putin regularly and has said his own interests cannot be separated from those of the Russian state. He features in Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the US election because of his ties to Paul Manafort, Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman. Russia\u2019s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, told his government to draw up possible retaliatory steps. He said the new US sanctions were unacceptable and illegitimate, and that the government would come up with plans to support the companies affected. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow was watching events on the markets closely but that an assessment of the impact of the sanctions would take time. \u201cThe situation is pretty egregious from the point of view of legality, it tramples on all kinds of norms, and so a thorough analysis is necessary,\u201d he said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s fate could be known as soon as next week as WPP moves swiftly to complete the investigation into allegations of personal misconduct against its chief executive. Sorrell, who cut a rare holiday short to return to WPP\u2019s headquarters in Mayfair\u2019s Farm Street, central London, to deal with the allegations, said last week he expected the investigation to be \u201ccompleted shortly\u201d. The outcome of the independent investigation being conducted by law firm WilmerHale could be completed as soon as next week, according to a source familiar with the process. Sorrell, who has built WPP into the world\u2019s biggest marketing and advertising group since starting the business in 1985, is carrying on work as usual, preparing to engage with analysts and media for the company\u2019s first-quarter results set for 30 April. Last week, WPP\u2019s board revealed that it had appointed WilmerHale, which has headquarters in Boston and Washington as well as an office in London, as independent counsel to investigate an allegation of personal misconduct. Separately, WPP uses law firms Allen &amp; Overy and Slaughter and May as advisers. The inquiry is being led by WPP chairman Roberto Quarta and senior non-executive director Nicole Seligman, a former top executive at Sony and attorney who represented Oliver North in the Iran-Contra hearings and was later part of Bill Clinton\u2019s team during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Late last week, Sorrell moved to beef up his legal representation appointing two partners from the London office of American law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan. Richard East and Sue Prevezer, QC, co-managing partners, have been instructed to work with Sorrell\u2019s personal lawyer, Lewis Silkin partner Richard Miskella. \u201cI reject the allegation unreservedly but recognise that the company has to investigate it,\u201d Sorrell said last week. \u201cI understand that this process will be completed shortly. Obviously, I shall play no part in the management of the investigation underway.\u201d Quarta, a US businessman hired as WPP\u2019s chairman two years ago, said at the company\u2019s annual general meeting last year that succession planning to replace 73-year-old Sorrell has intensified, becoming \u201ceven more focused and detailed\u201d. He said there was an \u201cexceptional team of potential candidates\u201d from WPP\u2019s top management to replace Sorrell, as well as a \u201cconstantly refined list of external candidates\u201d. The investigation has dramatically increased pressure on Sorrell, who is already feeling the strain as WPP\u2019s share price has tumbled more than 30% in the past year, wiping \u00a39bn off the value of the business. Among internal WPP candidates the strongest is considered to be Mark Read, a former executive board member and head of WPP\u2019s digital strategy, who is currently global chief executive of ad group Wunderman. However, observers believe if the investigation goes against Sorrell the fallout for WPP, and the wider global advertising eco-system, will be rapid and catastrophic. One quirk of Sorrell\u2019s unique relationship with WPP is in his contract. Instead of the standard notice period of 12 months, it says he or the company can terminate his service \u201cat will\u201d. \u201cIf Martin falls, WPP falls,\u201d said one top advertising executive. \u201cThere will be chaos. The industry is not prepared, clients are not prepared. In the short term there will be chaos. The advertising industry is run like show business, it\u2019s all about short-termism and that\u2019s the problem.\u201d However, Sorrell has a received a boost from Harris Associates, the firm\u2019s biggest shareholder. \u201c\u2018Unless we hear Sir Martin has committed material offences, we believe he is the correct person to lead WPP,\u201d said partner David Herro.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets are having a nervy day, as investors try and come to terms with the current state of the trade dispute between the US and China. A seemingly conciliatory tweet from President Trump over the weekend gave some grounds for optimism that the tit-for-tat tariffs may not turn into a full blown trade war. But today Trump was back on the attack again, calling the current trade practices \u201cstupid.\u201d Elsewhere Barclays deputy chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone praised Chinese president Xi Jinping for his \u201cauthoritarian\u201d leadership. He was speaking at the Boao Forum where Xi is due to give a keynote speech on Tuesday. The uncertainty saw markets come off their best levels. The FTSE 100 was already underperforming other markets, as companies with Russian links were hit by the new round of sanctions unveiled on Friday. So despite an opening rise on Wall Street, the FTSE 100 is currently down 0.3%, while the German and French markets are virtually flat. On the economic front, there were some positive UK house price figures from the Halifax. But eurozone consumer sentiment fell sharply, down for the third month in a row and there was some weak trade data from Germany. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, unveiled its \u00a330m Brexit bill as part of its annual business plan. And on the corporate front Deutsche Bank has ousted its British born chief executive John Cryan in an attempt to get back on track. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The International Monetary Fund has warned of a demographic timebomb for developed economies such as Britain, the USA and Japan that will require a radical rethink for immigration policies in response. Identifying a mounting threat to economic growth and the welfare systems of the world\u2019s most advanced countries, the fund said increasing numbers of baby boomers reaching retirement could potentially \u201coverwhelm\u201d these countries. It said throwing open their borders to more immigrants and boosting the participation of women and older people could help to solve the problem, at a time when the working age population will be expected over the coming decades to support roughly double the number of elderly people as they do today. The comments came as part of the funds World Economic Outlook. US markets have recovered some ground after Friday\u2019s losses, on hopes that the trade dispute with China can be resolved through negotiation. Investors are also hoping that this week\u2019s start of the reporting season, with results due from the likes of JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, will see some positive news. The recent tax cuts unveiled by Donald Trump, which have been out of the spotlight since the trade row began, should give a boost to corporate earnings. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 185 points or 0.8% higher, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.65% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.86% higher. But uncertainty remains about the trade conflict given Trump\u2019s various twitter comments, and ahead of a key speech by Chinese president Xi on Tuesday. All the morning\u2019s gains on European stock markets have virtually evaporated, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac both flat, and the FTSE 100 down 0.25%. Wall Street is still expected to open higher, but not as strongly as the futures were suggesting earlier, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tipped to gain around 180 points. Markets have come off their best levels after President Trump made another twitter intervention into the current trade dispute with China. Germany\u2019s Dax is now up 0.55% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.24%. But the FTSE 100 is virtually flat, with mining companies in particular under pressure as the sector is hit by the latest US sanctions on Russian firms. Chinese president Xi\u2019s speech on Tuesday is likely to be one of the most important events of the week for stock markets, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda: Whether the [positive market] moves we\u2019re seeing at the start of the week in Asia and Europe \u2013 and in US futures \u2013 reflect optimism that a solution [to the current trade dispute] will be found or are simply a case of profit taking on Friday\u2019s moves isn\u2019t clear but a speech from Chinese President Xi Jinping scheduled for Tuesday may point towards the former. China has been gradually opening up its markets for a long time now and there is a hope that Tuesday\u2019s speech may contain some commitments that will help kick start negotiations between the world\u2019s two largest economies. The message from Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro \u2013 White House Senior Economic Advisor and Director of the White House National Trade Council, respectively \u2013 in recent days has been that, while US President Donald Trump is willing to embark on tariffs, he is open to negotiations in order to avoid this. This very much supports the view that this is simply a tactic to get China to the negotiating table and perhaps we can start to see less confrontational talk and more willingness to find a diplomatic solution. This makes Xi\u2019s speech on Tuesday one of, if not the, most important event for markets this week. Many expect announcements on further opening of the Chinese economy, the question is how far he\u2019ll go and whether it will be enough to satisfy the US administration, at least to the point that it takes on a less provocative approach. Any indication that this is the case could provide some reprieve for markets and lift investor sentiment. Speaking of China, Barclays bank deputy chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone has praised the country\u2019s president Xi Jinping for his \u201cauthoritarian\u201d leadership. Grimstone - who is also chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen - said at the Boao Forum for Asia, that China was \u201cwonderful\u201d for UK business. In a Bloomberg TV interview, he added: The fact that Xi is prepared to give such strong authoritarian guidance within the context of a market economy is great for companies such as mine. He also said the current dispute between the US and China \u201ccould potentially be a trade war.\u201d The full story and Grimstone\u2019s comments are here. President Xi is due to give a keynote speech on Tuesday at the Boao Forum - which is taking place on the tropical island of Hainan - where he is expected to address the trade situation. Well, that didn\u2019t last long. President Trump is on the attack again on Chinese trade: It may be generally calm in the markets but not for companies with Russian links. In the wake of the latest US sanctions on Russian businesses, a number of listed firms have seen their shares come under pressure again. EN+, which manages the assets of tycoon Oleg Deripaska, is down 27% while Roman Abramovich\u2019s Evraz has lost 15.5% - the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 - and Polymetal has fallen 8.7%. European markets are managing to hold on to their gains, but the continuing trade tensions between the US and China mean this positivity could prove fleeting, says Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG: European markets are in a more optimistic mood today, with the focus shifting towards a more constructive end to the US-China stand-off. However, recent weeks have shown us that volatility is likely to remain a key part of the trading landscape, with daily shifts in tone from US and China driving huge swings in stocks of late. A relative dearth of major economic releases over the first two days of this week provides greater emphasis on the geopolitical factors that have shaped market sentiment over recent weeks, with North Korea and particularly China likely to remain key going forward. Donald Trump clearly believes that a crisis will be averted by a deal which would allow free trade between the countries and compromise over intellectual property; however the risk of failure to find a resolution is very real for the global economic picture. The fear is that we have two stubborn and headstrong leaders who are unlikely to cave in, with the stand-off growing increasingly fraught as time passes. At the moment the FTSE 100 is up 0.2%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.9% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.5%. Back with the UK house price figures, and here is our report by Julia Kollewe: House prices strengthened in March to post their biggest monthly gain since August, according to Halifax, the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. The average price of a UK home rose 1.5% in March to hit \u00a3227,871, the highest recorded price. Prices in the three months to March were 2.7% higher than a year earlier, up from the 1.8% annual growth recorded in February. The strong house price growth came as a surprise after months of lacklustre growth and declines in December and January reported by Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group. Rival lender Nationwide reported a 0.2% decline for March to \u00a3211,625, the second monthly fall in a row. However, Halifax warned that monthly changes could be volatile. Prices fell 0.1% between January and March compared with the previous three months, the second consecutive quarterly decline. The full story is here: And here are some comments on the figures: Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders: After February\u2019s freeze, the March thaw brought some relief to the property market \u2013 but only just. The month-on-month jump in average prices shouldn\u2019t be taken as a sudden blooming of pent-up demand. On a quarterly basis, prices are still stagnating; and nationally the market remains stuck in its familiar pattern of tantalising inertia. For every two steps forward, it takes one step back. That said the economic backdrop hasn\u2019t just thawed \u2013 it\u2019s warming up. Slowing consumer price rises mean wages will soon be growing again in real terms. Few things stoke buyers\u2019 confidence more than the sense that their paypackets are rising, and the Halifax\u2019s research shows mortgages are now at their most affordable for a decade. Yet no-one is predicting a sudden acceleration in demand. The crucial ingredient \u2013 buyer confidence in the future course of the market \u2013 remains in short supply. Sam Mitchell, chief executive of online estate agents HouseSimple.com: For a month in which persistent snow kept cars on drives, this is an enormous rebound, albeit that stock shortage is playing a major role in average monthly price volatility. We actually saw quite a few opportunistic sellers taking advantage of the bad weather last month to steal a march on the competition and market while there were fewer properties being listed. Now the snow has melted, we should see a healthy bounce in activity this month as we come into what is seasonally a busy period for the property market. For homeowners who might have delayed marketing their properties in March, this is their window of opportunity. Any Brexit fears seem to have abated for the time being and we are seeing a healthy level of interest from buyers, particularly in the north of England where the stamp duty freeze for first time buyers has definitely helped stimulate the market. Savvy sellers, who are pricing effectively, are having no problems getting offers, even in the tougher London market, where there are still plenty of committed buyers. Brian Murphy, head of lending for the Mortgage Advice Bureau: The report released by the Halifax this morning suggests that the UK housing market is ticking over steadily, with house price growth mainly unchanged on the previous quarter. The month on month increase of 1.5% now suggests an all-time high in terms of average house price, and overall the data would seem to indicate that the market is so far performing to expectations this year, including the annual forecast released by the Halifax for 2018 at the end of last year. In many respects, a report suggesting that house price growth is mainly unchanged represents a \u2018no news is good news\u2019 result for the property market, as given the current challenges of low available stock levels, impending interest rate increases and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the fact that both activity and values seem to be maintaining a stable trajectory does underline the strength of consumer confidence in bricks and mortar. The fact that prices aren\u2019t increasing at a steeper rate does mean that, hopefully, more First Time Buyers will be able to take advantage of both the raft of competitively priced mortgages which are still available, together with the exemption on Stamp Duty and Land Tax and get onto the housing ladder in the coming months. Elsewhere in the market, for those wanting to trade up to a larger property, the current trend of more sustainable price increases together with better mortgage affordability will, hopefully, enable those who want to move home this year with the right environment to do so. Here\u2019s a bit of gloom from the eurozone. Consumer sentiment fell in April for the third month in a row, due to concerns about a possible trade war between the US and China and a slowdown in global growth. The Sentix index fell from 24 in March to 19.6 in April, lower than the forecast level of 20. Economic expectations turned negative for the first time since July 2016. Sentix managing director Patrick Hussy said: Even though the current situation is still rated as excellent...the prospects for the future have become massively gloomier. The customs disputes, fuelled by US president Donald Trump, are leaving their traces. The City watchdog has outlined plans to significantly increase its spending on Brexit to help smooth the process for financial firms, one of the biggest sectors of the economy that could face disruption. The Financial Conduct Authority will need about \u00a330m for making changes to the way it governs the work of banks, insurers and asset managers in the City of London, according to its annual business plan published on Monday. The EU withdrawal budget, paid for by fees levied on the finance industry, is the first time the regulator has outlined a specific price tag for Brexit and illustrates the ballooning costs for many government organisations as the UK leaves the EU. The FCA said it had earmarked \u00a32.5m in additional costs last year, although had done some work from its existing half a billion-pound budget to carry out some of its work on Brexit in the last financial year. Over in Germany, there has been a boardroom shake-up at the country\u2019s biggest bank. Julia Kollewe reports: Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s biggest lender, has ousted its British chief executive, John Cryan, after years of losses and promoted the co-head of its retail banking arm to the top job. Following a two-week boardroom battle, Deutsche has appointed Christian Sewing as chief executive with immediate effect. He vowed to take \u201ctough decisions\u201d to return the bank to profitability. Cryan, a Yorkshireman who took the helm at Deutsche in June 2015, leaves at the end of this month, two years before his contract was due to end. Our full story is here: Here are the recent movements in house prices according to the Halifax: House prices in the UK rose by 1.5% in March compared to the previous month, according to the Halifax. This was a better than expected result, with analysts forecasting growth of just 0.2%. This was the fasted increase since August last year, but the Halifax does point out the monthly figures can be volatile. House prices rose by 2.7% in the first three months of the year compared to the same period last year, up from the 1.8% annual growth reported in February. But compared to the October to December quarter, they slipped by 0.1%, the second successive decline on this measure. Russell Galley, Halifx managing director, said: House prices in the three months to March were largely unchanged compared with the previous quarter. The annual rate of growth continues to be in a narrow range of under 3%; though the average price of \u00a3227,871 is a new high. Activity levels, like house price growth, have softened compared with a year ago. Mortgage approvals are down compared to 12 months ago, whilst home sales have remained flat in the early months of the year. This lack of direction in the housing market is in stark contrast to the continuing strength of the UK jobs market. The unemployment rate is now the joint lowest since 1975 and in the three months to January there were 402,000 more people in work compared to a year earlier. In the coming months we expect price growth to remain close to our prediction of 3% despite the very positive factors of continuing low mortgage rates, great affordability levels and a robust labour market. The continuing shortage of properties for sale will also support price growth. Investors are also looking to a speech from China\u2019s president Xi on Tuesday, where he is expected to comment on the current trade situation with the US. Let\u2019s hope he also expands on his \u201cfriendship\u201d with Donald Trump (as referenced by the US president over the weekend.) As expected, European markets have made a steady start to the week on hopes that the trade dispute between the US and China can be resolved before the threatened tariffs kick in. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.22% , while Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 index opened up 0.3%. Germany\u2019s Dax has added 0.5% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.2%. Wall Street is expected to follow the generally positive mood when US markets open later, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average predicted to rebound by more than 200 points. This would not recover the 572 point drop seen on Friday, but US markets have been so volatile in recent days that it would be no surprise to see the Dow do that during the day. Earlier there was some weaker than expected trade data from Germany, with imports and exports both down. It is the weakest start to a new year since 2009, says economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank, at a time when Trump\u2019s tariff plans could hit the country\u2019s economy: The latest trade data confirm that the German economy has had a weak start to the new year. Both exports and imports took an unexpected hit in February. Exports dropped by 3.2% month on month (from -0.4% in January), while imports decreased by 1.3% month on month, (from -0.4%). The trade surplus widened somewhat, from 17.3bn euro in January to 18.4bn euro in February. These days, talking about trade means talking about Trump and tariffs. In Germany, these talks have caused quite some goose bumps. Rightly so. In 2017, the US was Germany\u2019s largest export partner. The bilateral trade surplus amounted to more than 50bn euro, with vehicles and machinery recording the largest bilateral surplus. At the same time, Germany runs a significant trade deficit with the US in agricultural products. The only comforting factor for Germany is that it has a very diversified export sector, particularly in terms of geographic diversification. Still, even though the current stage of the global trade conflict seems to be limited to China and the US, Germany could become the first prominent victim outside of these two countries. China announced to impose a 25% import tariff on cars produced in the US. This would immediately harm Germany as the single largest car exporting company in the US is in fact a German car manufacturer. While the prospects for the German export machinery have deteriorated significantly in recent weeks, the present state of the economy gives some reasons for concern. In fact, the entire start to the year 2018 has been a disappointment. Sentiment indicators have started to weaken, albeit from record highs, and industrial data for the first two months showed the weakest performance since 2009. In our view, seasonal effects, the cold winter weather and a flu epidemic were probably the main drivers of this disappointment. At least in the near term, sound fundamentals, low interest rates, record high employment, high capacity utilisation, low inventories and filled order books are strong arguments in favour of a re-acceleration of the economy. However, if anything downside risks for the economy have clearly increased in recent weeks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It was another wild week on stock markets last week as the rollercoaster ride that is the trade dispute between the US and China continued to unnerve investors. After the US detailed the $50bn of tariffs it would slap on Chinese goods, Beijing responded with its own targeted list, but hopes of talks behind the scenes to avert a trade war seemed to calm the markets a little. Until that is President Trump raised the stakes by promising to increase the tariffs to $100bn of goods. Perhaps overcome by trade fatigue, European markets merely shrugged, but on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.3% on Friday. But in another turnaround, Trump seemed to be more conciliatory over the weekend. He tweeted: So Asian markets have edged higher, with the NIkkei 225 up 0.5% and European markets set to follow suit. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: Steep declines on Wall Street have been shrugged off in Asian markets overnight and European shares look set for a positive open. US shares had initially held up relatively after President Donald Trump threatened another $100bn in tariffs against China. Few were willing to hold on over the weekend after US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin acknowledged the possibility of a trade war. Trump tweeted over the weekend with respect to China that \u2018Taxes will become reciprocal &amp; a deal will be made on intellectual property.\u2019 Trump\u2019s softened stance offers some hope for calm in his trade dispute with China. The opening calls from IG show: It is also the start of the US reporting season, and it will be interesting to see if investors can break away from watching Trump\u2019s twitter account to concentrate on what companies are saying about the economy Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: With US earnings season starting this week some decent reports could be the difference between a rebound off these [market] lows, and optimism about future profits or worries as to whether we\u2019ve seen the high water mark for profits growth. Investors will have to look past recent tax changes, as well as market volatility and flatter yield curves to determine what effects these might have on long term profitability.

China has been gradually opening up its markets for a long time now and there is a hope that Tuesday\u2019s speech may contain some commitments that will help kick start negotiations between the world\u2019s two largest economies. </p> <p>The message from Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro \u2013 White House Senior Economic Advisor and Director of the White House National Trade Council, respectively \u2013 in recent days has been that, while US President Donald Trump is willing to embark on tariffs, he is open to negotiations in order to avoid this. This very much supports the view that this is simply a tactic to get China to the negotiating table and perhaps we can start to see less confrontational talk and more willingness to find a diplomatic solution.</p> <p>This makes Xi\u2019s speech on Tuesday one of, if not the, most important event for markets this week. Many expect announcements on further opening of the Chinese economy, the question is how far he\u2019ll go and whether it will be enough to satisfy the US administration, at least to the point that it takes on a less provocative approach. Any indication that this is the case could provide some reprieve for markets and lift investor sentiment. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5acb4048e4b0131dfe31d8c2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-09T10:37:21.403Z\">11.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Barclays deputy chairman praises Chinese president's &quot;authoritarian&quot; leadership</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Speaking of China, Barclays bank deputy chairman Sir Gerry Grimstone has praised the country\u2019s president Xi Jinping for his \u201cauthoritarian\u201d leadership.</p> <p>Grimstone - who is also chairman of Standard Life Aberdeen - said at the Boao Forum for Asia, that China was \u201cwonderful\u201d for UK business.

Slowing consumer price rises mean wages will soon be growing again in real terms.</p> <p>Few things stoke buyers\u2019 confidence more than the sense that their paypackets are rising, and the Halifax\u2019s research shows mortgages are now at their most affordable for a decade.</p> <p>Yet no-one is predicting a sudden acceleration in demand.

The month on month increase of 1.5% now suggests an all-time high in terms of average house price, and overall the data would seem to indicate that the market is so far performing to expectations this year, including the annual forecast released by the Halifax for 2018 at the end of last year. </p> <p>In many respects, a report suggesting that house price growth is mainly unchanged represents a \u2018no news is good news\u2019 result for the property market, as given the current challenges of low available stock levels, impending interest rate increases and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the fact that both activity and values seem to be maintaining a stable trajectory does underline the strength of consumer confidence in bricks and mortar. The fact that prices aren\u2019t increasing at a steeper rate does mean that, hopefully, more First Time Buyers will be able to take advantage of both the raft of competitively priced mortgages which are still available, together with the exemption on Stamp Duty and Land Tax and get onto the housing ladder in the coming months. Elsewhere in the market, for those wanting to trade up to a larger property, the current trend of more sustainable price increases together with better mortgage affordability will, hopefully, enable those who want to move home this year with the right environment to do so.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-04-09T09:10:03.873Z\">at 10.10am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5acb24f5e4b0131dfe31d7d3\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-09T08:38:38.290Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Eurozone consumer confidence falls for third month in a row</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a bit of gloom from the eurozone.</p> <p>Consumer sentiment fell in April for the third month in a row, due to concerns about a possible trade war between the US and China and a slowdown in global growth.</p> <p>The Sentix index fell from 24 in March to 19.6 in April, lower than the forecast level of 20.

This was a better than expected result, with analysts forecasting growth of just 0.2%.</p> <p>This was the fasted increase since August last year, but the Halifax does point out the monthly figures can be volatile. House prices rose by 2.7% in the first three months of the year compared to the same period last year, up from the 1.8% annual growth reported in February.</p> <p>But compared to the October to December quarter, they slipped by 0.1%, the second successive decline on this measure. Russell Galley, Halifx managing director, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>House prices in the three months to March were largely unchanged compared with the previous quarter. The annual rate of growth continues to be in a narrow range of under 3%; though the average price of \u00a3227,871 is a new high. </p> <p>Activity levels, like house price growth, have softened compared with a year ago. Mortgage approvals are down compared to 12 months ago, whilst home sales have remained flat in the early months of the year. This lack of direction in the housing market is in stark contrast to the continuing strength of the UK jobs market. The unemployment rate is now the joint lowest since 1975 and in the three months to January there were 402,000 more people in work compared to a year earlier. </p> <p>In the coming months we expect price growth to remain close to our prediction of 3% despite the very positive factors of continuing low mortgage rates, great affordability levels and a robust labour market. The continuing shortage of properties for sale will also support price growth.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d326ec2da81d2c8c84ae0db96724baa7171f378b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d326ec2da81d2c8c84ae0db96724baa7171f378b/7_15_1020_874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"houseprice9apr\" width=\"1000\" height=\"857\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5acb167ce4b06589375a72cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-09T07:30:49.225Z\">8.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Investors are also looking to a speech from China\u2019s president Xi on Tuesday, where he is expected to comment on the current trade situation with the US.

It is the weakest start to a new year since 2009, says economist Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank, at a time when Trump\u2019s tariff plans could hit the country\u2019s economy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest trade data confirm that the German economy has had a weak start to the new year. Both exports and imports took an unexpected hit in February. Exports dropped by 3.2% month on month (from -0.4% in January), while imports decreased by 1.3% month on month, (from -0.4%). The trade surplus widened somewhat, from 17.3bn euro in January to 18.4bn euro in February. </p> <p>These days, talking about trade means talking about Trump and tariffs. In Germany, these talks have caused quite some goose bumps. Rightly so. In 2017, the US was Germany\u2019s largest export partner. The bilateral trade surplus amounted to more than 50bn euro, with vehicles and machinery recording the largest bilateral surplus. At the same time, Germany runs a significant trade deficit with the US in agricultural products. The only comforting factor for Germany is that it has a very diversified export sector, particularly in terms of geographic diversification.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"415a2de612fc69b62e01987d0874c52443339805\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/415a2de612fc69b62e01987d0874c52443339805/0_145_4373_2625/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coils are stored on trains in front of the ThyssenKrupp steel mill in Duisburg, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coils are stored on trains in front of the ThyssenKrupp steel mill in Duisburg, Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Schulze/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>Still, even though the current stage of the global trade conflict seems to be limited to China and the US, Germany could become the first prominent victim outside of these two countries. China announced to impose a 25% import tariff on cars produced in the US. This would immediately harm Germany as the single largest car exporting company in the US is in fact a German car manufacturer.</p> <p>While the prospects for the German export machinery have deteriorated significantly in recent weeks, the present state of the economy gives some reasons for concern. In fact, the entire start to the year 2018 has been a disappointment. Sentiment indicators have started to weaken, albeit from record highs, and industrial data for the first two months showed the weakest performance since 2009. In our view, seasonal effects, the cold winter weather and a flu epidemic were probably the main drivers of this disappointment. At least in the near term, sound fundamentals, low interest rates, record high employment, high capacity utilisation, low inventories and filled order books are strong arguments in favour of a re-acceleration of the economy. However, if anything downside risks for the economy have clearly increased in recent weeks. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5acb0526e4b06589375a726a\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-04-09T06:44:19.342Z\">7.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Agenda: UK house prices and eurozone confidence figures due</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.</strong></p> <p>It was another wild week on stock markets last week as the rollercoaster ride that is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/06/trump-threatens-extra-100bn-of-tariffs-on-chinese-imports\">the trade dispute between the US and China</a> continued to unnerve investors.</p> <p>After the US detailed the $50bn of tariffs it would slap on Chinese goods, Beijing responded with its own targeted list, but hopes of talks behind the scenes to avert a trade war seemed to calm the markets a little.</p> <p>Until that is President Trump raised the stakes by promising to increase the tariffs to $100bn of goods.

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank has ousted its British chief executive, John Cryan, after years of losses and promoted the retail banking arm co-head to the top job. Following a two-week boardroom battle, Deutsche appointed Christian Sewing as chief executive on Monday with immediate effect. He vowed to take \u201ctough decisions\u201d to return the bank to profitability. Cryan, a Yorkshireman who took the helm in June 2015, will leave at the end of this month, two years before his contract was due to end. Deutsche has had three years of losses, and its net loss widened in the fourth quarter. Cryan has been criticised for being too slow in pushing through cost-cutting measures at the bank, which employs 100,000 people worldwide. As part of the boardroom shake-up, Garth Ritchie will become sole head of the corporate and investment bank. He had shared the role with Marcus Schenck, who earlier said he would leave the bank after the annual meeting on 24 May. Ritchie and Karl von Rohr, an executive board member, were appointed deputy CEOs. Sewing, 47, started working for Deutsche as an apprentice in 1989 and has held roles including head of group audit and management positions in risk. He told staff in a letter published on the bank\u2019s website that he would thoroughly analyse how Deutsche wants to position its investment bank in a difficult market environment. \u201cThe priority is to leverage our strengths and to allocate our investments accordingly. And at the same time, we will look to free up capacity for growth by pulling back from those areas where we are not sufficiently profitable,\u201d he said. Octavio Marenzi of the consultancy Opimas said there could be job losses in London as a result. \u201cWe can expect a much stronger emphasis on the domestic German market, with a focus on commercial and retail banking, and wealth management. It looks like the board of directors is capitulating on the investment banking front,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will hit Deutsche Bank\u2019s London presence particularly hard, where the bulk of its investment banking activity is based. We expect to see those activities right-sized or sold off, with attendant headcount reductions.\u201d Deutsche\u2019s chairman, Paul Achleitner, thanked Cryan for the \u201ccritical role\u201d he played in his relatively short tenure as CEO, but said \u201cwe came to the conclusion that we need a new execution dynamic in the leadership of our bank\u201d. Cryan took a \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3348,000) pay cut last year and was paid \u20ac3.4m. He and the rest of the 13-member management board waived their bonuses for 2017, but their collective pay still rose from \u20ac25.9m in 2016 to \u20ac29.2m. The UBS analysts Daniele Brupbacher and Mate Nemes said Sewing\u2019s appointment sent out signals of stability and continuity, and underlined the importance of the German business. \u201cChristian Sewing\u2019s first statements do not indicate major strategic shifts, but a continued focus on costs and getting the structures right, particularly in investment banking, where we would expect further adjustments to the footprint. Also, a focus on rigorous and faster execution could be the result,\u201d they said. They said the investment banking strategy remained the key strategic question mark and achilles heel of Deutsche.",

We expect to see those activities right-sized or sold off, with attendant headcount reductions.\u201d</p> <p>Deutsche\u2019s chairman, Paul Achleitner, thanked Cryan for the \u201ccritical role\u201d he played in his relatively short tenure as CEO, but said \u201cwe came to the conclusion that we need a new execution dynamic in the leadership of our bank\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.db.com/ir/en/download/DB_Annual_Report_2017.pdf\">Cryan took a \u20ac400,000 (\u00a3348,000) pay cut last year</a> and was paid \u20ac3.4m. He and the rest of the 13-member management board waived their bonuses for 2017, but their collective pay still rose from \u20ac25.9m in 2016 to \u20ac29.2m.<br></p> <p>The UBS analysts Daniele Brupbacher and Mate Nemes said Sewing\u2019s appointment sent out signals of stability and continuity, and underlined the importance of the German business. </p> <p>\u201cChristian Sewing\u2019s first statements do not indicate major strategic shifts, but a continued focus on costs and getting the structures right, particularly in investment banking, where we would expect further adjustments to the footprint. Also, a focus on rigorous and faster execution could be the result,\u201d they said.<br></p> <p>They said the investment banking strategy remained the key strategic question mark and achilles heel of Deutsche.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Brexit has fallen into second place as the most significant risk facing company bosses for the first time since the EU referendum, as weak domestic growth saps demand for their goods and services. According to a Deloitte survey of chief financial officers (CFOs) at some of the UK\u2019s biggest businesses, companies are now less pessimistic about Brexit after ministers agreed the terms of a transition period with Brussels to smooth Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Reflecting the views of 106 companies, including almost a quarter of the FTSE 100, the survey found a fifth of business leaders were more optimistic about their firm\u2019s prospects than they were three months ago. On a scale of 0 to 100 for the risks facing their business, the CFOs assigned a rating of 56 for Brexit versus 57 for weak demand as a result of sluggish growth in the economy. Deloitte said this was the first time since the spring of 2016 \u2013 before the EU referendum \u2013 that Brexit had fallen behind any other potential risk facing businesses, although admitted that some of the weakness seen in the economy will have come as a result of the vote to leave the EU. David Sproul, senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte for north west Europe, said: \u201cWeak UK demand is cited as the top concern, though there is likely to be a relationship between the two. Brexit remains a major concern for UK CFOs, though one which, in the wake of the announcement of the transition deal, is easing.\u201d The sudden drop in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote pushed up the cost of importing food and fuel to Britain, triggering a spike in inflation and eroding the spending power of consumers. Several companies, including Toys R Us and Maplin have gone into administration as a consequence. The economy has recovered in recent months, with signals that the inflationary effects of the weak pound are beginning to fade, while workers\u2019 pay is gradually starting to rise. But there are still significant pressures for the economy, including weak productivity growth and potential labour shortages. Still, the results of the Deloitte study follow a similar assessment from the Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents, who found two-fifths of the more than 3,000 firms that they surveyed had not spent any time at all on a weekly basis planning for Brexit. The accountancy firm EY also found there was little impact from the vote on international firms investment decisions in the UK so far. However, there is a danger that businesses could become complacent following the agreement over the transition period, which pushes out the date at which Britain leaves the EU until December 2020. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: \u201cAlthough the transition arrangement is done, they have yet to settle the border in Northern Ireland and the future trading relationship. Were that not to happen that would be a big problem and would have a significant effect on business confidence.\u201d There are already warning signs for the road ahead. According to EY, around half of the foreign companies currently in the UK could consider moving assets out of the country at some point after 2020, depending on the outcome of the ultimate Brexit deal.",

      "bodyText": "European flotations have made a strong start to the year despite the current market uncertainty brought on by a possible trade war between the US and China, rising interest rates and the prospect of tougher regulation on tech firms. Across Europe, the first quarter of the year recorded 67 initial public offerings (IPOs) raising a total of \u20ac12.5bn (\u00a310.8bn), up from 54 and \u20ac4.6bn in the same period in 2017, according to PWC\u2019s latest survey of flotations. The UK lagged behind after a strong performance at the start of last year. The London Stock Exchange played host to 16 of the 67 first-quarter IPOs, raising \u00a31.3bn. This was down from 20 flotations in the first three months of 2017, which raised \u00a31.8bn. Lucy Tarleton, capital markets director at PwC, said: \u201cThe first quarter is typically a quieter quarter in terms of UK IPO activity, and last year it was boosted by a backlog of IPOs after a pause in activity following the EU referendum. \u201cThe outlook is promising and issuers continue to be attracted to the UK market with a number of crossborder IPOs set to launch in London.\u201d Meanwhile the total European figures for the first quarter were down on a strong fourth quarter, when 116 companies joined the market and raised more than \u20ac16bn. Of the companies joining the UK market between January and March, nine were on the main list and seven on the junior Aim market. The five biggest companies were Energean Oil &amp; Gas, Jersey financial group JTC, financial adviser IntegraFin, Baillie Gifford US Growth Trust and JPMorgan Multi-Asset Trust. The financial sector dominated the listings, accounting for 72% of the proceeds raised. The best performers of the new UK arrivals were Aim-listed cyber security business GRC International, up 112% compared with the FTSE All Share index, and IntegraFin on the main market, up 33%. The worst were Aim-listed property company Onthemarket, down 32% and mining group Cradle Arc, 31% lower. AIQ Limited, a Cayman Island incorporated company set up to make e-commerce acquisitions, had its shares suspended after they rose sharply before it had even done any business. The biggest flotations across Europe were medical technology company Siemens Healthineers and Deutsche Bank\u2019s asset manager DWS Group, which raised \u20ac3.7bn and \u20ac1.3bn, respectively. They both listed on Deutsche Borse, making it the top exchange by value during the period. Mark Hughes, capital markets partner at PwC, said: \u201cThe first quarter of 2018 has seen increased volatility and significant corrections to global indices. Europe\u2019s IPO markets have proved resilient with investors eager to find value and ready to engage in early conversations with companies with compelling equity stories and solid fundamentals.\u201d",
