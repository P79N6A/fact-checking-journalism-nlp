      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is to set up a compensation fund for small business customers who claim they were badly treated by the bailed-out bank, in an attempt to draw a line under the long-running scandal. The bank, 73% owned by the taxpayer, has repeatedly defended itself against persistent claims from small businesses that they were deliberately pushed to the brink of collapse to enable it to make a profit. Its chief executive Ross McEwan, who has previously admitted that RBS let some small businesses down, is now preparing to announce a scheme to pay redress to customers in its global restructuring group \u2013 known as GRG and since disbanded. The bank would not comment on Monday amid expectations that announcement would be made before the stock market opened on Tuesday. There were reports that the sum being offered in compensation would amount to around \u00a3300m. McEwan, a New Zealander who has been running RBS for three years, is again expected to insist the bank has not seen evidence to support claims that it forced viable business to fail. The bank has in the past said: \u201cIn the aftermath of the financial crisis we did not always meet our own high standards and we let some of our SME customers down.\u201d But the creation of a scheme to compensate some customers is likely to be seized upon by small business customers as an admission it made some mistakes \u2013 although RGL Management, formed to gather claims against the bank, has been saying since April it intends to lodge legal claims worth more than \u00a31bn against the bailed-out bank on behalf of small business customers. As recently as last month, when RBS reported its results for the first nine months of the year, campaign groups set up by small businesses were angered at its refusal to set aside any money to pay compensation for them. The announcement coincides with an appearance by Andrew Bailey, the new chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, at the Treasury select committee of MPs which has taken evidence from current and former RBS executives about the allegations. A report commissioned by the FCA into the conduct of the GRG division has been much delayed, and is now expected to be published by the end of the year. Bailey is likely to face questions about this during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, which will be chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie. The allegations surfaced in 2013 when Lawrence Tomlinson, a businessman who was an advisor to the then business secretary Sir Vince Cable, compiled a dossier of allegations that RBS was deliberately wrecking small businesses to make profits for the bailed-out bank. At the time Tomlinson said he been approached by businesses which had ended up in GRG and had their properties sold to the bank\u2019s specialist property arm, West Register. It prompted RBS to commission a report from law firm Clifford Chance which \u201cfound no evidence that the bank \u2018low-balled\u2019 bids to customers in the hope or expectation of acquiring properties at a low price\u201d. But the law firm did say that \u201cboth in relation to the handover process and the restructuring process more generally, some [RBS] customers complained that they experienced insensitive, rude or aggressive behaviour.\u201d Clifford Chance explicitly criticised the bank for a lack of transparency on fees. But the claims of mistreatment by small businesses have refused to die down and delays to the official FCA report have fuelled anger from business people who claim they have lost their livelihoods. The report was first expected in December 2015, delayed to April 2016 and then in October the FCA said it had received the final report from the so-called skilled person, the firms Promontory Financial Group and Mazars. \u201cThere are a number of steps for the FCA to complete before we are in a position to share our final findings, which will include an assessment of all relevant material, of which the skilled person\u2019s report is one. This has been a complex and lengthy review \u2013 it is therefore important that we do not rush the final stages of this process,\u201d the FCA said in October. RBS is battling to put a long list of so-called conduct issues behind it. It also faces a bill from the Department of Justice in the US for the way it sold mortgage bonds a decade ago. Some analysts reckon this could amount to \u00a39bn. Chancellor Philip Hammond has also abandoned any attempts, for now, to sell off any more of taxpayers\u2019 remaining 73% stake in the bank after an initial 5% shareholding was sold in August 2015.",

    "webTitle": "Dow Jones surges by 371 points as Wall Streets bets on Clinton victory \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "DING DING! Wall Street has just posted its best day since the start of March, as the closing bell brings today\u2019s rally to a halt. Predictions of a Hillary Clinton election victory have cheered the markets, ending a nine-day losing streak. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 371 points, or 2.08%, with the S&amp;P 500 gaining 2.1%. The tech stock-heavy Nasdaq index gained almost 2.5%, as investors piled back into shares. This followed a strong rally in Europe, where London\u2019s FTSE 100 posted a triple-digit gain. Chris Beauchamp of IG says we\u2019ve seen a buying stampede today: According to the IG binary market, IG clients think Hillary remains the favourite, with her chances of election holding at 81%.* US assets have been heavily bid throughout the day, as the nine-day selloff is banished to distant memory. With around 36 hours to go until the result becomes known, there is plenty of potential for upsets however, and we may see the bullish move falter tomorrow if the battleground states remain in close contention. As we\u2019ve been covering in this blog since early morning, the FBI\u2019s decision to clear Hillary Clinton over her email server has given the Democratic candidate a last-minute lift. But.... this race is not over, even if some investors are acting like Clinton is home and dry. Key states such as Florida, North Caroline and Pennsylvania will determine who wins the White House. And the word from the campaign trials is that the race is still tight. Here\u2019s a flavour of our latest news story: The US presidential campaign ended on Monday where the fiercest nomination battles began \u2013 in the rustbelt \u2013 as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spent the last hours of a bitter election focused on the country\u2019s deep economic divide. Democrats gained a late confidence boost as a final series of national opinion polls confirmed a small but steady lead for Clinton. Early voting numbers point already to record turnout among Latino voters stirred into action by Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric. But the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state-level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for Trump. He hopes to galvanise white working-class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally Democratic manufacturing regions, though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including Florida and North Carolina to win outright. Sensing possible danger, the Clinton campaign poured last-minute resources into the industrial midwest, a region where she struggled against a similar anti-establishment surge for Bernie Sanders during the primary election season. Both Clinton and Barack Obama held afternoon rallies in Michigan before planning to finish the night on stage together in Philadelphia with Bruce Springsteen.... Do stay tuned to our general election liveblog, and we\u2019ll be back in the morning with more market action. Goodnight! GW The Dow Jones industrial average is pushing even higher in the final few minutes of trading, and is now up 2%..... I knew there was something important coming up. Thanks, AP! Shares in shipping, logistics and transport companies are having a particularly good day, sending the Dow Jones Transportation Average up by 2.8% in late trading. The index has gained 19% since January, which is significant as it\u2019s often seen as a bellwether for the wider economy (companies don\u2019t ship as much if they\u2019re losing business). Analysts reckon that the transport sector would do well under a Clinton or Trump presidency, as both have promised spending on infrastructure. Marketwatch has more details. The British pound continues to be buffeted by the sudden strength of the US dollar today. Sterling has shed one cent, or 0.9%, today and is currently hovering around $1.24. The dollar is up around 0.75% against a basket of currencies today, including the euro and the yen. That\u2019s (yet) another sign that investors are pricing in a Clinton victory. Constellation Brands, which imports beers such as Mexico\u2019s Corona, has joined the Mexican Peso as a surprise proxy for Trump success. Shares in Constellation have jumped by 4% today, having fallen pretty steadily through November. Trump\u2019s anti-Mexico rhetoric has worried many US firms who import from Mexico, as he has pledged to shake up trade links between the two countries. With less than 90 minutes to go until the closing bell, Wall Street is still on a tear and on track for its best day\u2019s trading since March. Signs that Hillary Clinton has a better chance of winning tomorrow\u2019s election are driving share higher, despite many polls suggesting she only has a narrow lead over Donald Trump. Here\u2019s the situation on the trading floors: Dow Jones: up 335 points or 1.8% at 18,223 S&amp;P 500: Up 43 points or 2% at 2,128 Nasdaq: Up 111 points or 2.4% at 4,771 With Clinton seen as the more status quo option, investors are aware that the markets could tumble if Donald Trump stages a surprise victory. Jeff Carbone, co-founder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina, says (via Reuters): \u201cI don\u2019t see another 5 percent bump on a Clinton win, but I could see a 5 to 7 percent pullback on a Trump win.\u201d The gold price is continuing to slide today, as traders put their money into riskier assets. Bullion is down 1.8% right now at $1,280 per ounce, down from $1,304 on Friday night. Our colleagues in America are relentlessly live-blogging the final day of the campaign. They\u2019ve already covered of a speech by president Barack Obama, fears of voter suppression in North Carolina, and analysis of how often each candidate has fibbed during the campaign race.... Today\u2019s stock market rally has added tens of billions of dollars to the wealth of the world\u2019s richest people. Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which tracks those with more money then they could possibly know what to do with, has jumped by 0.9% today to $4.4 trillion, a gain of $37bn. Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, gained $2.7bn, while Mexico\u2019s richesst man, Carlos Slim, gained a far from slimline $2.2nbn. Well done chaps. And now we know who\u2019ll suffer if the markets have a meltdown on Wednesday..... Stock markets could plunge by over 5% on Wednesday if Trump beats Clinton, according to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group\u2019s Derek Halpenny. He was speaking to Sky News a few minutes ago: The S&amp;P 500 index has jumped by 2% today, which puts it on track for its best one-day performance since March this year. That would also reverse nine-days of losses, which accelerated after FBI chief James Comey sensationally revealed that the agency was investigating a new set of emails related to Hillary Clinton. The oil price has also risen today, with the price of a barrel of New York light crude gaining 0.6% to $44.34. The rally is partly due to Hillary Clinton\u2019s improved prospects in the election, now that the FBI have cleared her of criminal wrongdoing over those emails. Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, summed up the mood: \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit less of a concern about the economy falling apart.\u201d And here\u2019s a reminder of why financial investors worldwide are wary of Trump: Each of the 30 shares on the Dow Jones index has risen so far today, as investors pour money back into stocks. United Healthcare is leading the rally, up 3.2%, followed by tech firms Microsoft and Intel, and banking giants JP Morgan and Goldman. Supermarket titan WalMart is bringing up the rear, with a 0.4% gain. And this has sent the Dow up by a chunky 350 points, or 1.96%. Although some pollsters say the election looks tight, New York traders are calculating that Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of victory have risen since the FBI cleared her over her email server last night. And Clinton continues to be seen as a more attractive candidate by Wall Street than Donald Trump, given (among other things) his opposition to trade deals. Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, explains (via Reuters) \u201cClinton is a known quantity and investors hate uncertainty and they are very happy even if taxes were to go up ... In the case of Trump, it is uncertain as to what he stands for.\u201d Volatility on Wall Street has fallen to its lowest level since the Brexit vote, in another sign that investors are more relaxed about the election. One letter was all it took to send stock markets sharply higher. The news that FBI director James Comey had written to Congress to say Hillary Clinton had no case to answer over the latest batch of contentious emails boosted her chances against Donald Trump and sent investors scrabbling to buy shares. In Europe the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 113.64 points or 1.7% higher at 6806.90, its biggest one day rise since 2 September Germany\u2019s Dax jumped 1.93% to 10,456.95 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.91% higher at 4461.21 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 2.56% to 16,736.75 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.45% at 8918.8 In Athens, the Greek market added 1.16% to 580.57 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 344 points or 1.93%. Whoever wins the US election, the initial market reaction may not last long, according to Capital Economics\u2019 Simon MacAdam. He said: In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long. Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen. The flip-side is that we don\u2019t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u2019s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u201cmajors\u201d, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings. As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u2019 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u2013 potentially Democrat-controlled \u2013 Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u2019t alter investors\u2019 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries. And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact. MacAdam said: There are at least two other points to consider. First, the market impact could well be amplified or diluted by the outcome of the Congressional elections, no matter who wins. In particular, if Trump were to win the presidential race and the Republicans retain control of both Houses of Congress, then market reactions would probably be more significant that they would be if the Senate came under control of the Democrats, thereby enhancing the restraints on the domestic power of the president. Second, if the presidential election result turns out to be extremely close and is contested, then a protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on equity markets, as was the case in 2000. Back with the markets and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stabilised with a rise of around 260 points, while the FTSE 100, German Dax and French Cac are all around 1.5% higher. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Monday has proceeded in a way eerily similar to the scenes before the Brexit back in June. In the run-up to the referendum the markets saw a last minute surge as investors prepared to Britain to remain in the EU, only to suffer a shock when the votes were counted. The market has a bit more time to steady itself before the results of the election are announced; as the US electorate head to the polls tomorrow it will be interesting to see whether investors opt for continued Clinton confidence, sensible stability, or a sharp turn Trump-wards. And here, courtesy of Nomura, is a look at how the last four US elections played out (timings Eastern time): Former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan - he of \u201cirrational exhuberence\u201d - is critical of both candidates in terms of their economic acumen: Here are the biggest risers on Wall Street so far: As expected, US markets are moving ahead now Hillary Clinton has been cleared by the FBI over her emails, improving her prospects a day before the election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 250 points while the S&amp;P 500 has climbed 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite is up 1.6%. If you want to follow the last day of campaigning in the presidential election, our US blog has the coverage: Just under half an hour until Wall Street opens, and the futures are predicting a sharp rise following the latest election news: And here\u2019s a guide to which states report when: Memories of June\u2019s EU referendum are still quite raw in the City of London. Investors vividly remember seeing the pound suffer an almighty slump on June 24th this year, falling from $1.50 to $1.36 in a single panic-driven session. Could Trump vs Clinton offer a repeat performance? Not if the polls are right...but don\u2019t forget that the Remain campaign held a clear lead as Brits cast their votes. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: There is always an element of Deja Vue effect, which we had during Brexit. Right now, the base case for markets is that Clinton will win the election. This is the biggest worry for us and the possibility of surprise should not be undermined. Donald Trump\u2019s victory will not only bring the knee jerk reaction for the market, but we are also concerned about the geopolitical uncertainty. So far looking at the Mexican peso, it is very clear that traders are respecting the reliability of the US polls. The US polling has a much better track record predicting that who is in the lead and who will be in the Oval Office. There is huge money involved in this process and they pay attention to every grain in reflecting the results. Bloomberg have also knocked up a cheat sheet showing how a Trump win would be bad for shares and the US dollar, but good for gold. Analysts at Dutch bank ING say the US dollar will rally against the euro and the yen if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, while the Mexican Peso would also surge. But it\u2019s the opposite story if Trump triumphs - although in both cases it also depends what happens on Capitol Hill. Here\u2019s ING\u2019s cheat sheet: They\u2019ve also produced this map, showing how Pennsylvania and Florida could be the key to the contest. If Trump loses one, he needs the other plus four more key swing states: Investors betting on a Clinton victory should remember the 24th June, when the Leave campaign defied the pollsters and won Britain\u2019s EU referendum It could happen again this week, warns Luke Hickmore, senior fixed income fund manager at Aberdeen Asset Management: \u201cMarkets are edging towards Clinton largely because of polling and we saw in the Brexit referendum how wrong that can be. The memory of that referendum should loom large in investors\u2019 memories because so much of the polling was wrong then.\u201d (quote via Reuters) OK, it\u2019s breakfast time in America (on the easterly side of the country, anyway) so let\u2019s quickly recap. Stock markets have rallied strongly this morning after Hillary Clinton received a late boost in her bid to become US president. Shares have jumped in Asia and Europe, following the news that the FBI have found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing over her private email server. Investors are calculating that FBI James Comey\u2019s announcement raises the chances that Clinton beats Donald Trump to the White House. So they\u2019re putting money into shares, and taking it out of safe assets such as gold and the Japanese yen. Here\u2019s the situation: FTSE 100: Up 96 points or 1.4% at 6789 German DAX: Up 170 points or 1.6% at 10429 French CAC: Up 76 points or 1.75% at 4454 Wall Street traders are expected to send share prices romping higher when trading begins in a couple of hours. This follows nine days of consecutive losses, as election uncertainty has bitten. The Dow Jones industrial average is being called up 229 points, or over 1.2%. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx says: Looking ahead to the US open and it seems that there is going to be a rare example of the Dow Jones and dollar both heading in the same direction this afternoon. With the greenback already on a tear the Dow is expected to rise more than 200 points after the bell, putting it back above the 18000 it fell below last week. The US dollar is enjoying a strong rally, and is up one cent against the British pound at $1.242. But the Mexican peso is doing even better; which also suggests traders are cutting the chances of a surprise Trump victory. New polls have given Clinton the edge in the national polls, with Bloomberg giving her a three-point lead. But key battleground stakes such as Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida will determine the battle. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at City trading firm IG, says European stock markets are \u201cin a buoyant mood\u201d following the FBI announcement. The big question is whether this announcement will have a material effect upon the outcome of the US election, which is clearly perceived to be the case according to today\u2019s market reaction. But investors are also nervous, especially given the recent Brexit shock: With the IG binary now showing an 83.5% chance of a Clinton victory (up from Friday\u2019s 74%), it is clear that traders expect this announcement to have a substantial impact upon the election result. However, if the EU referendum taught us anything, it is to not be complacent when there is a vote against a campaign which appeals to the disaffected and marginalised section of a population. Here\u2019s another poll, giving Hillary Clinton the edge: This is helping to keep stock markets buoyant today....and possibly setting investors up for a big fall on Wednesday, if the polls are wrong. Investors (and concerned citizens) across Europe need to decide whether to pull an all-nighter to follow the US election, or get up extra-early to see the result. Based on the last four elections... we can say that the results could be in by 5am GMT (or midnight in New York), if it\u2019s a decisive win for either candidate. In 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama has given his victory address before the London stock markets had opened. But in 2004, we didn\u2019t get the result until around lunchtime in New York, when the City of London was winding down for the day. And the 2000 race between George W Bush and Al Gore wasn\u2019t decided for a month - following legal challenges over the result in Florida. Analysts at Japanese bank Nomura say: Hopefully by 4am to 5am (GMT) on Wednesday we\u2019ll have a good idea, but if it\u2019s close\u2026it could be another 12 hours (or more) from then. They\u2019ve created some handy graphics to show how the last four races ended, and how this year\u2019s could play out: Just in: Clinton holds a three point lead over Trump, according to a Bloomberg poll conducted between Friday and Sunday. There are two scenarios in which the US election could spark a stock market rout, says Mohamed A. El-Erian, the chief economic adviser of investment giant Allianz. The first, unsurprisingly enough, is that Donald Trump becomes US president, sending share prices sliding as investors fear for the future. El-Erian explain why, in an article for Bloomberg. An equity market selloff is likely should Donald Trump win the presidential vote and also reaffirm his intention to move quickly on policy positions that disrupt long-standing trade relationships (such as tariffs on China and Mexico and the revocation of the North American Free Trade Agreement). The selloff would be larger if he also were to also create uncertainty about the future shape of the financial system, such as by calling for an immediate repeal of the Dodd-Frank legislation without offering a credible alternative. The second scenario is that Hillary Clinton wins the White House, and the Democratic party takes control of Congress. That would clear the way for reforms to clean up the energy sector, and price controls on biotech companies, along with higher government borrowing to boost growth. The other tail event, a Clinton win combined with a Democratic sweep of Congress, would likely bring about an equity market selloff that would entail more pronounced moves for certain sectors (such as pharmaceuticals and traditional energy). Bond markets would also come under pressure because of the higher probability of fiscal stimulus. World First\u2019s chief economist, Jeremy Cook, has taken a stab at how tomorrow\u2019s election may play out: Every European stock market has jumped by at least 1% today, led by Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB index, setting the scene for a Wall Street rally: Today\u2019s stock market rally shows that Hillary Clinton deserves her reputation as Wall Street\u2019s favoured candidate, says Yann Quelenn, market analyst at online bank Swissquote. He writes: This morning, the US elections is definitely the financial markets\u2019 barometer. Futures on the S&amp;P are up 1.3% at the moment and we should see a good day on stocks. This relief rally is definitely proving the fact that markets are clearly supporting Hillary, justifying her \u201cCandidate of Wall Street\u201d moniker. Consequently, a Clinton win would spark a significant relief rally in overly-bearish positioned markets. Queleen also reminds us that the US stock market just racked up a nine-day losing streak, for the first time in 36 years, as panicky investors fled the trading floors. The US dollar\u2019s resurgence has brought the British pound back to earth with a bump, and back below $1.24. Sterling rallied strongly last week, on hopes that the UK government might negotiate a \u2018softer\u2019 Brexit. It got a real lift on Thursday, after the high court ruled that prime minister Theresa May can\u2019t trigger the exit process without parliament\u2019s approval. But the dollar now has the upper hand, following the FBI\u2019s decision. And that shows the US election is a more immediate concern than Britain\u2019s departure from the EU. Sterling\u2019s weakness continues to push shares higher in London, as it means international-focused firms who earn money in US dollars will benefit. Since June, we\u2019ve seen a clear pattern that the FTSE rises when the pound fall, and vice versa, as Neil Wilson of ETX Capital explains: Driving the FTSE 100 higher today are the big foreign-earners like drug companies, miners, oil producers and HSBC \u2013 the bank makes up over 5% of the FTSE 100 by index weight so today\u2019s 4% rise is helping the blue chip index in no small way. Back in the UK, the Halifax bank has reported that British house prices jumped by 1.4% last month. That\u2019s much stronger than expected, and something of a surprise as rival lender Nationwide has already decided that prices were flat in October. It may mean that households aren\u2019t too worried about the prospect of Britain leaving the EU, says Rob Weaver of property crowdfunding platform Property Partner. The market suffered an initial wobble post-Brexit but is proving resilient, mostly the result of the severe supply shortage that\u2019s helping to prop up prices. And here\u2019s a chart showing how the Mexican peso rallied hard overnight, as the FBI\u2019s announcement hit the wires: Here\u2019s confirmation that the US stock market is on track for a pre-vote bounce: Gold is getting a hammering this morning, as fears of a Trump presidency recede. The gold price has dropped by 1.4% to $1.286 per ounce, ending its recent rally. Gold had benefitted from anxiety over the US election, with investors looking for somewhere safe to put their money. You can almost hear the sigh of relief from the City, as fears over the US election subside. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: Election fears be damned! The European markets roared into life this Monday following a bit of good news for the Clinton campaign.... The thinking will be that this news may well swing any undecided voters back towards Clinton, therefore lifting her already substantial chances of winning Tuesday\u2019s election. However, regular readers may remember that the stock markets also rallied on June 23rd, on predictions that the Remain campaign would win the UK\u2019s EU referendum. It didn\u2019t quite turn out like that, as Campbell reminds us: Given that Trump-fears were what dragged the market down at the end of last week it is understandable that the markets have seen such explosive gains after the bell \u2013 though, it must be noted, there were similar scenes before the Brexit back in June. Financial analysts say that the markets are betting on a Hillary Clinton win this morning, after the FBI gave the \u2018all-clear\u2019 last night. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale explains: Yesterday\u2019s statement from the FBI that there was nothing new in the latest batch of Clinton emails, has swung market sentiment back towards a Clinton win and risk is \u201con\u201d. Whether voters see it that way, we\u201dll see soon enough. Gold, yen are down; yields, equities, oil and the dollar are up. Sean Callow, a senior strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney, says today\u2019s market rally shows that investors are worried about a Trump victory: \u201cA Clinton win would clear the decks for the Fed to raise rates in December and for markets to price in a more aggressive profile for tightening over 2017\u201d \u201cThe surge in U.S. equity futures and slide in the gold price reinforces the evidence that a Trump win is seen as negative for global growth and profits.\u201d But Rachel Cunliffe, deputy editor of news website Reaction, points out that Clinton may still be damaged: Wall Street is expected to join the rally when trading begins in around six hours time. The futures market is predicting that the Dow Jones industrial average will gain 230 points, or 1.2%. Banks and natural resource stocks are leading the rally in London, driven by bets that Hillary Clinton is on track for victory. Mining giants BHP Billiton, Antifagasta, Rio Tinto and Glencore are all among the risers, along with HSBC (which posted financial results this morning). They\u2019re driving the FTSE 100 up sharply in early trading, with only a handful of stocks struggling. Henry Croft of Accendo Markets says the rally is triggered by Hillary Clinton getting the all clear from the FBI for a second time. Polls are indicating Clinton pulling away slightly, although her lead remains well below the levels pre-FBI investigation. The election will be the driving force for markets before Wednesday morning. Of course, the internationally-focused FTSE 100 index also benefits from the weak pound (which has shed a whole cent this morning to $1.241). Ding Ding! European stock markets are rallying, as traders react to the overnight news from America. In the City, the FTSE 100 blue-chip index has jumped by 100 points, or 1.5%. There are similar gains in Paris and Frankfurt, as money pours into riskier assets - and out of save havens like gold and the Japanese yen. Kathleen Brooks of City Index says the FBI\u2019s decision to clear Clinton (again) could be a \u2018game changer\u2019 in the race for the White House. But investors will wonder how much damage has already been done, in the nine days after James Comey announced that a new set of emails were being examined. Brooks says: The Clinton camp will be hoping that the reopening of the FBI investigation, which turned out to be for nothing, put off not too many early voters. Ultimately it all rests on the Electoral College votes, and in this area Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead looks solid, but not as insurmountable as it once did. She is predicted to win 216 votes, vs. 164 for Trump. However, we expect her lead to widen once more, if the latest FBI announcement translates into more Electoral College votes on Monday, as we expect. She adds that traders won\u2019t be counting Donald Trump out of the race, though: You can\u2019t rule out Trump, and the risk of shy Trump voters disrupting polling expectations in key swing states such as Florida and Ohio remains a known unknown in this election race. For markets this is ultimately the key concern \u2013 traders don\u2019t have any special insight into this outcome of this election and this may limit market cheer at the start of this week on the back of Clinton\u2019s email scandal being put to bed (again.) Traders may prefer to sit on the sidelines until the actual result is called The US dollar is on a tear this morning, following after the FBI confirmed that it won\u2019t bring charges against Hillary Clinton over emails related to her personal email server. The greenback has gained 0.7% against the euro, and almost 0.9% against the pound, in a broad-based rally against other leading currencies. But the Mexican peso is actually gaining ground against the dollar. It rises whenever Donald Trump\u2019s victory chances fall, given the Republican nominee\u2019s plans to build a large wall on the US border. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. After a particularly lengthy and bloody battle, the US presidential race is heading into its final hours. In 48 hours time, we\u2019ll probably know whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump have claimed the White House. And shares are rallying across the world after Clinton got a late boost -- with FBI director James Comey announcing that he will not bring charges against the Democratic candidate after examining a new set of emails. Comey told Congress last night: \u201cBased on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.\u201d Clinton\u2019s camp has welcomed the news that Comey has confirmed his initial decision back in July (although they must still be irked that the FBI chief shook up the campaign nine days ago by announcing that the emails were being probed). Trump reacted in a fairly predictable manner - crying foul and claiming that the FBI couldn\u2019t actually review 650,000 emails in eight days. Either way, Comey\u2019s announcement has sparked a wave of buying, as investors around the globe calculated that Clinton\u2019s chances of success have risen. Shares have jumped in Asia, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei gaining 1.6%. And European and US markets are expected to follow suit, with the FTSE 100 tipped to jump by 1%. The US dollar is also gaining. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: The US dollar has rebounded and equity markets look likely to follow suit this morning, after both fell heavily last week on fears about the unknown quantity a Trump win would mean. As the more status quo candidate, Clinton is definitely the markets\u2019 preferred winner; she\u2019s less likely to provoke a global trade war or destabilise the geopolitical order by pulling back from Nato (Trump has suggested members of the alliance should pay for America\u2019s protection). Trump\u2019s attacks on America\u2019s top central banker, Janet Yellen, have also alarmed investors. Naeem Aslam of Think Markets explains: The question which traders are concerned about is whether a Trump\u2019s victory can really topple the investor confidence in the market? Well, that depends on if he will be a typical politician or not. If he sticks to his words and fires Janet Yellen from her job, the market is going to see that as a massive event of uncertainty.... Also, if he increases the trade tariffs, it will impact the growth in China and Mexico (this is where he has the strongest view). The spill over effects will not only be limited to emerging markets, but also in the developed markets as well. Also coming up today.... Although the US election is the main event, the City will also get some new economic data to digest 8.30am GMT: Halifax house price index, showing how the UK property market performed in October 9.30am: Sentix\u2019s survey of eurozone investor confidence for November 10am: Eurozone retail sales for September We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our view, any relief at a Clinton win would be short-lived, as her victory is largely priced into markets. But even if Trump pulls off a surprise win, we do not expect any sell-off to last long.</p> <p>Starting with the stock market, while we think there would be a further rally in US equities if Clinton were to win, we doubt they would strengthen significantly for two reasons. First, attention would once again focus on the prospects for tighter Fed policy. Second, we think the US dollar would strengthen.</p> <p>The flip-side is that we don\u2019t think the knock to US equities would last long if her rival were to emerge victorious. A Trump presidency would presumably mean monetary policy staying looser for longer, which would be positive for the stock market, all else equal. What\u2019s more, we think the accompanying narrowing of interest rate differentials with other economies, in conjunction with capital outflows into safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, should see the US currency weaken against other \u201cmajors\u201d, thereby providing further uplift to US equities by boosting the dollar value of overseas earnings.</p> <p>As for the Treasury market, a Trump win should be positive due to investors\u2019 expectations for a looser Fed policy outlook. Granted, relatively dovish Fed Chair Janet Yellen may resign if the Republican candidate wins the keys to the White House, which could arguably put the Fed on course for less dovish policy. But if she were to step down, it is by no means clear that (i) Trump would put forward a particularly hawkish candidate for her replacement, (ii) the \u2013 potentially Democrat-controlled \u2013 Senate would approve such a nominee, or (iii) the independence of the Federal Reserve would be brought into question in any case. A Democrat presidency, however, probably wouldn\u2019t alter investors\u2019 US rate expectations by much. If anything, it would increase the perceived likelihood of a resumption of Fed tightening in December, which would be negative for Treasuries.</p> </blockquote> <p>And it is not just the presidential race which could have an impact. MacAdam said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are at least two other points to consider. First, the market impact could well be amplified or diluted by the outcome of the Congressional elections, no matter who wins. In particular, if Trump were to win the presidential race and the Republicans retain control of both Houses of Congress, then market reactions would probably be more significant that they would be if the Senate came under control of the Democrats, thereby enhancing the restraints on the domestic power of the president.</p> <p>Second, if the presidential election result turns out to be extremely close and is contested, then a protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on equity markets, as was the case in 2000.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58209c27e4b029b92ca464fe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-11-07T15:23:59.316Z\">3.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Back with the markets and on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stabilised with a rise of around 260 points, while the FTSE 100, German Dax and French Cac are all around 1.5% higher.

      "bodyText": "Tesco Bank\u2019s chief executive Benny Higgins isn\u2019t paid \u00a32.2m a year (plus fabulous taxi expenses) on a whim. He commands a banker\u2019s princely pay packet because the supermarket chain intends to be big in banking. Expanding in financial services is a sensible strategy if, like Tesco, you think you have three factors in your favour. First, your brand enjoys greater \u201ctrust\u201d than those of the old institutions that disgraced themselves in the crash, like Higgins\u2019 former employers HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland. Second, the regulatory winds are favourable because politicians are desperate to see a few so-called \u201cchallenger\u201d banks provide some stiffer competition. Third, Tesco Bank doesn\u2019t have any costly branches. That backdrop is important as Tesco Bank suffers an online bank robbery that, on the sketchy details to date, looks bigger and more alarming than any recent cyber-attack in the sector. Tesco Bank customers hold 135,000 current accounts. Of those, \u201csuspicious\u201d transactions were seen in 40,000 accounts, with around half seeing cash removed. That\u2019s a lot, which is why Tesco investors\u2019 apparently sanguine view of the affair \u2013 the share price fell only 1% \u2013 is odd. The direct cost of reimbursing customers may be merely a rounding error for a company of Tesco\u2019s size but the knock-on effects, in the form of regulatory intervention and criticism, could be severe. Among the bodies who want to know what went wrong are: the Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank of England, the National Crime Agency and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office. It\u2019s odds-on that somebody on that list will insist on root-and-branch reform of the systems to detect and prevent fraud. Tesco, remember, has offered current accounts for less than three years and its IT systems ought to be state-of-the-art because they are relatively new. It is early in the adventure to suffer an attack of this magnitude. A repetition might oblige the bank to retreat to the safer worlds of car insurance and credit cards. Judgment must be reserved until full details are clear. But it seems quite likely the fine for the security breach could easily be bigger than the accumulated profits Tesco Bank has made from current accounts to date. In the shoes of Tesco shareholders, you\u2019d surely want to know more about this failure before assuming it\u2019s a hiccup that could happen to anyone. Sports Direct: MPs\u2019 visit kicks off further scrutiny \u201cI have nothing to hide,\u201d Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley declared to the MPs on the business select committee during his appearance in June. Apart, that is, from the camera that was allegedly hidden in the corner of the room where the parliamentarians took sandwiches on Monday. Yes, it\u2019s the latest chapter in the Sports Direct saga, each plotline more absurd than the last. As it happens, Ashley was abroad on Monday so, unless he was relaying orders to his staff, he\u2019s innocent of the charge of attempting to bug the MPs at the end of their unannounced visit to the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. But, if the MPs\u2019 account of events is accurate, somebody authorised the camera wheeze. Wright would be entitled to insist on knowing who. Such matters, however amateurish in execution, are meant to be serious. Either way, the corporate paranoia has probably ensured MPs will refuse to close the book on Sports Direct just yet. It could have been different. A brisk trot around the aisles might have revealed little, allowing the MPs to declare their work to be done and to take their sandwiches back in London. Instead, says Wright, they were received with delays, hostility and \u201cdiversionary tactics.\u201d They\u2019ll be back. Sports Direct, it seems, doesn\u2019t know when to stop shooting itself in the foot. Volkswagen\u2019s P\u00f6tsch likely to motor on How is the reinvention of Volkswagen after the diesel emissions scandal going? Not well. German criminal prosecutors have widened their investigation into potential manipulation of the market to include Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the former finance director who was inexplicably promoted to be chairman of the supervisory board. The investigation may come to nothing, of course, but the probe underlines why the appointment of P\u00f6tsch provoked fury among those VW investors who think German carmaker doesn\u2019t understand what proper boardroom reform means. Fund manager Hermes spoke for many at the annual meeting in June when it said it was \u201cstruggling to understand\u201d how P\u00f6tsch, after 12 years as finance director, could be put in charge of a supervisory board whose duties include examining whether claims could be made against former executives. The probe by public prosecuters concerns the timing of VW\u2019s confession to investors that it had used illegal \u201cdefeat\u201d devices to get around emissions tests. As such, it could be deemed secondary to the central question of how the devices were installed in the first place. But secondary does not mean unimportant: VW is aleady inundated with lawsuits that concentrate on the disclosure point. P\u00f6tsch\u2019s continuing presence at the top of the company adds complication on complication. In a rational world, he would stand aside until the German authorities have decided whether to bring charges. But he won\u2019t.",

He commands a banker\u2019s princely pay packet because the supermarket chain intends to be big in banking.</p> <p>Expanding in financial services is a sensible strategy if, like Tesco, you think you have three factors in your favour. First, your brand enjoys greater \u201ctrust\u201d than those of the old institutions that disgraced themselves in the crash, like Higgins\u2019 former employers HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland. Second, the regulatory winds are favourable because politicians are desperate to see a few so-called \u201cchallenger\u201d banks provide some stiffer competition. Third, Tesco Bank doesn\u2019t have any costly branches.</p> <p>That backdrop is important as Tesco Bank suffers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/tesco-bank-freezes-transactions-online-attack\">an online bank robbery</a> that, on the sketchy details to date, looks bigger and more alarming than any recent cyber-attack in the sector. Tesco Bank customers hold 135,000 current accounts. Of those, \u201csuspicious\u201d transactions were seen in 40,000 accounts, with around half seeing cash removed. That\u2019s a lot, which is why Tesco investors\u2019 apparently sanguine view of the affair \u2013 the share price fell only 1% \u2013 is odd.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/tesco-bank-freezes-transactions-online-attack\">Tesco Bank freezes transactions after cash taken from 20,000 accounts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The direct cost of reimbursing customers may be merely a rounding error for a company of Tesco\u2019s size but the knock-on effects, in the form of regulatory intervention and criticism, could be severe. Among the bodies who want to know what went wrong are: the Financial Conduct Authority, the Bank of England, the National Crime Agency and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.</p> <p>It\u2019s odds-on that somebody on that list will insist on root-and-branch reform of the systems to detect and prevent fraud. Tesco, remember, has offered current accounts for less than three years and its IT systems ought to be state-of-the-art because they are relatively new. It is early in the adventure to suffer an attack of this magnitude. A repetition might oblige the bank to retreat to the safer worlds of car insurance and credit cards.</p> <p>Judgment must be reserved until full details are clear. But it seems quite likely the fine for the security breach could easily be bigger than the accumulated profits Tesco Bank has made from current accounts to date. In the shoes of Tesco shareholders, you\u2019d surely want to know more about this failure before assuming it\u2019s a hiccup that could happen to anyone.</p> <h2>Sports Direct: MPs\u2019 visit kicks off further scrutiny</h2> <p>\u201cI have nothing to hide,\u201d Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley declared to the MPs on the business select committee during his appearance in June. Apart, that is, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/six-mps-surprise-visit-sports-direct-shirebrook-warehouse\">the camera that was allegedly hidden in the corner of the room</a> where the parliamentarians took sandwiches on Monday.</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s the latest chapter in the Sports Direct saga, each plotline more absurd than the last. As it happens, Ashley was abroad on Monday so, unless he was relaying orders to his staff, he\u2019s innocent of the charge of attempting to bug the MPs at the end of their unannounced visit to the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. But, if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/07/six-mps-surprise-visit-sports-direct-shirebrook-warehouse\">the MPs\u2019 account of events</a> is accurate, somebody authorised the camera wheeze. Wright would be entitled to insist on knowing who. Such matters, however amateurish in execution, are meant to be serious.</p> <p>Either way, the corporate paranoia has probably ensured MPs will refuse to close the book on Sports Direct just yet. It could have been different. A brisk trot around the aisles might have revealed little, allowing the MPs to declare their work to be done and to take their sandwiches back in London. Instead, says Wright, they were received with delays, hostility and \u201cdiversionary tactics.\u201d They\u2019ll be back. Sports Direct, it seems, doesn\u2019t know when to stop shooting itself in the foot.</p> <h2>Volkswagen\u2019s P\u00f6tsch likely to motor on</h2> <p>How is the reinvention of Volkswagen after the diesel emissions scandal going?

      "bodyText": "Tesco Bank was scrambling to restore services for customers on Monday after it admitted 40,000 customers had been affected by an online heist over the weekend when money was stolen from half the number of accounts targeted. Tesco immediately froze online transactions and pledged to refund the 20,000 customers whose current accounts had been plundered in one of the largest cyber-thefts ever to hit a UK bank. Benny Higgins, chief executive of the supermarket chain\u2019s banking arm, said the decision to suspend some banking activities was an attempt to protect customers from \u201conline criminal activity\u201d. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is one of a number of organisations scrutinising what has taken place at a bank with more than 7 million customers. \u201cWe apologise for the worry and inconvenience that this has caused for customers, and can only stress that we are taking every step to protect our customers\u2019 accounts,\u201d said Higgins. Refunds to customers \u2013 some of whom claimed they had lost thousands of pounds \u2013 were under way on Monday but Higgins was facing demands from MPs for an explanation of what had gone wrong in the face of repeated warnings about cybersecurity from regulators in recent years. It is thought to be the first time such a large group of UK bank customers have lost money as a result of a single cyber-crime incident and could prove costly for its parent supermarket group in reputational as well as financial terms. There were also concerns of collateral brand damage for other digital and online banks attempting to compete with established high street players, as Tesco raced to keep pace with the deluge of complaints on social media about difficulty reaching its call centres in Glasgow and Newcastle. Higgins provided little explanation for what had gone wrong over the weekend, when the bank started to text customers to warn them it had detected suspicious activity. However, he told the BBC it was \u201ca systematic, sophisticated attack\u201d. The chief executive, who earlier this year faced questions about a \u00a318,000 expenses bill he had submitted to his employer, said the decision to \u201ctemporarily stop online transactions from current accounts\u201d was a temporary measure. Late on Monday, the bank admitted the suspension was still in place and it was \u201cworking hard to resume normal service on current accounts as soon as possible\u201d. Despite its more than 7 million customers who use services ranging from credit cards to small loans, Tesco Bank has just 137,000 current accounts. It has has been fighting to win current account business in a market that is traditionally dominated by the \u201cbig four\u201d of Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays. While customers can pay in cheques and cash at 300 Tesco stores, most of the business is conducted through an app and the internet. It has been trying to win customers by offering 3% interest on balances of up to \u00a33,000 \u2013 and letting customers have two accounts \u2013 at a time when others are cutting their rates. Tashema Jackson, money expert at price comparision website uSwitch.com, said: \u201cAs well as being a blow for Tesco Bank, there could also be knock-on effects for other challenger banks wanting to take market share from the high street banks. A security failure of this nature could mean challengers, who already face an uphill battle convincing customers to switch, may find concerns around security will further put people off making that step away from their current bank.\u201d Some of its customers appear to have used the current account purely as a savings account. One customer affected by the cyber raid, Mark Taylor, said he had never used his debit card because he uses the account purely as a home for his savings. Taylor had \u00a33,000 in the account and, after receiving a text message from Tesco at the weekend, he logged on and was shocked to see that his available balance had dropped to \u00a3574.73 after more than \u00a32,400 was apparently siphoned from it. \u201cI spent the next hour and 20 minutes on hold waiting to talk to Tesco. They blocked my account \u2013 worryingly it wasn\u2019t blocked already and the last \u00a3574 could have been taken. I\u2019m now waiting for a phone call back from their fraud team.\u201d Taylor, who lives in Leeds, said it later transpired that the money had been withdrawn in four separate transactions. The four amounts were for \u00a39.33, \u00a3802.61, \u00a3795.27 and \u00a3818.26, \u201call to different retailers in Spain\u201d. The incident has sparked a wave of theories about how it was orchestrated. Taylor, who works as a security engineer, speculated that it was an internal security breach. Others suggested that hackers had been involved. Conservative MP Chris Philp, a member of the Treasury select committee, said it could have been the work of a foreign power. \u201cI think we can\u2019t rule out the possibility, at all, that this is state-sponsored,\u201d he told the BBC. It comes after the Bank of England has issued a series of warnings about cybersecurity threats to the financial sector. But it is not the only industry which has been hit. Telecoms company TalkTalk was hit with a record \u00a3400,000 fine from the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in October for failing to stop personal data of 157,000 customers being obtained. The ICO is one of a number of authorities scrutinising Tesco Bank. City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority is monitoring the situation and keeping the Bank of England informed. The NCA said it had been notified by Tesco Bank and was coordinating a response among law enforcement agencies. ICO said: \u201cWe\u2019re aware of this incident and are looking into the details. The law requires organisations to have appropriate measures in place to keep people\u2019s personal data secure. Where there\u2019s a suggestion that hasn\u2019t happened, the ICO can investigate, and enforce if necessary.\u201d Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, said it was the latest in a long list of IT failures and security breaches in the financial sector. He added that he would writing to Higgins for an explanation and reassurance it will not happen again. \u201cMaking sure that banks improve their IT systems, and their resilience to cybercrime, is also a responsibility of regulators. We will raise this issue with them again shortly. We can\u2019t carry on like this,\u201d he said. Shares in Tesco, one of Britain\u2019s biggest listed businesses, were among the biggest fallers on the stock market. Pete Hahn, of the London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance, said: \u201cThe question is does the reputation that the bank has suffered translate to [Tesco\u2019s] other businesses.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s largest asset manager is to use its muscle as an investor to promote a green agenda by urging companies to tackle climate change and selling shares in those that do not. In a move that echoes a growing belief among investors that climate change poses financial as well as environmental risks, Legal &amp; General Investment Management launched the Future World Fund. The fund, a small part of L&amp;G\u2019s \u00a3853bn assets under management, will invest in a new FTSE climate index of 3,000 stocks \u201ctilted\u201d towards companies that contribute to a low-carbon future. As well as penalising oil and mining firms, the index excludes pure coalminers and companies that make controversial weapons such as cluster bombs and biological agents. This means that LGIM \u2013 and other funds that start using the index \u2013 will allocate less of their clients\u2019 cash to those industries. LGIM\u2019s other funds will continue to invest as normal, but the company will use its votes at company annual meetings to oppose the reappointment of chairmen who do not do enough to reduce carbon emissions. It said the decision had been spurred by the Paris climate agreement, which yielded a legally binding accord aimed at reducing carbon emissions. L&amp;G has already won the backing of HSBC, which will use the Future World Fund as the default home for the \u00a31.85bn of stocks in its \u00a32.6bn UK defined-contribution pension scheme. As well as tracking the FTSE climate index, the Future World Fund has singled out 84 stocks \u2013 in areas including oil, banking and mining \u2013 for special attention. It will sell investments in these companies completely if they do not do their best to tackle climate change. LGIM said it would raise climate concerns with senior executives, giving them a 12-month grace period to meet criteria seen as helping to tackle climate change. \u201cIf they need to improve we\u2019ll give them time to improve, but if there isn\u2019t substantial improvement then we\u2019ll divest,\u201d said Mark Zinkula, chief executive of LGIM. The asset manager is the latest big global institutional investor to add a moral dimension to its financial strategy. French investment giant Axa announced last year it was selling coal assets in favour of renewable energy and this year moved to offload \u00a31.5bn of tobacco investments. \u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful message we\u2019re sending,\u201d said LGIM\u2019s head of sustainability and responsible investment strategy, Meryam Omi. \u201cI don\u2019t think a message like this has come from [stock] index managers before.\u201d The chancellor, Philip Hammond, said: \u201cThree of Britain\u2019s biggest companies have come together for the launch of this groundbreaking new fund, which is a testament to our status as the world\u2019s leading financial centre.\u201d Environmental groups gave a cautious welcome to the decision but said LGIM could have gone further. \u201cWhat\u2019s flowing from the Paris agreement is a range of responses from different parts of the economy and politics, all of which is good because it\u2019s going in the right direction,\u201d said Andrew Pendleton, head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth. \u201cBut it would be better if we had a fund that actually provided people with the opportunity to vote with their feet and get out of fossil fuels altogether. \u201cWe need to start taking our money out of these assets and that needs to happen more quickly and decisively than this fund is proposing.\u201d Mark Thompson, chief investment officer for HSBC\u2019s UK pension scheme, said going any further would have limited the fund\u2019s potential to effect change. He pointed to HSBC\u2019s defined-contribution scheme, which already includes an equities fund that invests only in green companies. But pensioners have put just \u00a316m into the Jupiter Sustainable and Responsible Equities fund. He said L&amp;G\u2019s gentler approach would allow it to apply pressure on companies to go green \u201crather than being a niche fund that very few people will invest in\u201d. A survey conducted by LGIM found that 33% of people were not prepared to sacrifice any financial return for the sake of avoiding fossil fuel investment. But LGIM stressed that its new Future World Fund could outperform traditional funds. The fund will invest in firms in the FTSE\u2019s new Climate Balanced Factor Index, which delivered a 15.94% return between September 2011 and October 2016. This return meant it outperformed the 15.26% rise in the FTSE All World Index, which has no weighting based on climate criteria.",

      "bodyText": "Sports Direct\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate its reputation after a year-long scandal over working practices took a farcical turn on Monday when the retailer was accused of secretly recording a group of MPs visiting its controversial warehouse. Six MPs from the business select committee, which in the summer published a scathing report into company, also claimed the company treated the parliamentarians with \u201chostility\u201d and implemented \u201cdiversionary tactics\u201d as they carried out an impromptu inspection of the sportswear group\u2019s warehouse. The allegations of secret recordings were made after the parliamentarians had finished their tour, when they adjourned to a meeting room in Sports Direct\u2019s offices in order to discuss the day\u2019s events and take refreshments. Anna Turley, the Labour MP for Redcar and a member of the committee, told the Guardian: \u201cThe sandwich lady came in and she put them on [a stool] in the corner. I watched her do it because I thought it was a bit weird her putting them in the corner of the room rather than where we were sitting. I saw her kneel down and put a device under the stool. \u201cI watched her and waited until she got out of the room and I went over [to the stool] and it was a camera that [Sports Direct representatives] had with them on the visit, [when] they were recording every question we asked and everything we said.\u201d Iain Wright, chairman of the business select committee, said the whole day had reminded him of visiting factories in China. He added: \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t going to be the finished product. I knew we were going to see work in progress, as it were. But the hostility, the controlling manner, with which they dealt with us, the diversionary tactics ... I wanted to to go to [the old part of the warehouse which had been at the centre of the scandals] and it took us about three hours to get there\u201d. Wright, along with five colleagues, had arrived at the group\u2019s Shirebrook, Derbyshire headquarters at about midday on Monday, after notifying the company earlier that morning that the MPs were arriving for a surprise tour. The visit had come after Wright\u2019s committee had accused Mike Ashley, the billionaire Sports Direct founder, of running the business like a Victorian workhouse in a report published in July. The MPs concluded that Ashley had built his success on a business model that treats workers \u201cwithout dignity or respect\u201d, after they launched an inquiry following an undercover Guardian investigation last year that exposed how Sports Direct workers were being paid less than the minimum wage. It is understood Ashley was not present at Shirebrook for the inspection and the MPs were instead shown around by the group\u2019s global operations head, Karen Byers. In his excoriating appearance before the committee in June, Ashley pledged to look at areas where the company might improve conditions of its workers, including looking at the \u201csix strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d policy which threatened workers with the sack after a series of perceived crimes such as long toilet breaks. He also pledged to review if the company needs to engage so many of its workers\u2019 temporary contracts. The committee has no real powers to punish the tycoon if he fails to deliver on his pledges, although Wright had promised to \u201ccontinue to hold Mr Ashley\u2019s feet to the fire, in as constructive a manner as possible, checking on the progress he makes on improving working conditions for workers at his premises\u201d. In September, the company announced a suspension of the six strikes policy and a trial to move some temporary staff on to permanent contracts. It had previously addressed the minimum wage breach by increasing the pay of warehouse workers, while it had also committed to reimbursing with backpay those affected. The retailer has suffered a stream of criticism over its working practices, with officials from the Unite union campaigning against a strict culture in the warehouse that has made workers afraid to speak out over low pay and conditions in case they lose their jobs. Last year, primary schoolteachers told the Guardian that parents working at Sports Direct were too frightened to take time off work, resulting in pupils attending school while ill or returning home to empty houses. Wright and Turley were joined on his visit by fellow committee members Amanda Solloway, Peter Kyle, Michelle Thomson and Craig Tracey. Ashley appeared in front of the select committee in June having initially challenged the authority of parliament to summon him. He called the parliamentarians \u201ca joke\u201d, saying MPs needed to come to visit Shirebrook for themselves, but eventually backed down. He then extended an open invitation for MPs to visit the site. Sports Direct did not return phone calls seeking comment.",

The three main US indices all ended the day more than 2% higher, following strong gains in markets across the world. The US dollar also strengthened and the oil price ticked up by more than 1% in further signs of traders\u2019 confidence in a Clinton victory. Investor anxiety that the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, might secure the presidency on Tuesday had pushed Wall Street lower for the previous nine days \u2013 the longest losing streak in more than 35 years. Those fears were enhanced following the FBI\u2019s announcement on 28 October that it was reviewing newly discovered Clinton emails. However, on Sunday night FBI director James Comey told Congress that a review of the new emails \u201chad not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to secretary Clinton\u201d. Clinton\u2019s campaign was also boosted by early voting results, especially in Florida, a key swing state where Hispanic turnout is said to be 86% higher than in 2012. Four major polls on Monday showed Clinton leading the race for the White House. An ABC News/Washington Post poll put the Democratic nominee on 47% compared to Trump on 43%. The final Reuters/Ipsos poll before the election begins put Clinton\u2019s chances of defeating Trump at 90%. \u201cIt is certainly a relief rally for Hillary Clinton \u2013 investors worldwide were concerned about the uncertainty surrounding Trump,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. \u201cThe other, more subtle reason, is if they are ending this email controversy you are not going to have a cloud hanging over her administration, creating roadblocks to getting things done.\u201d The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day 371 points, or 2.1%, higher at 18,260 points. The S&amp;P 500 increased by 2.22% to 2,132 and the Nasdaq added 2.37% to 5,166.17. Earlier in the day the FTSE 100 in London had closed up 1.7% to 6,807 points \u2013 its biggest one-day rise since 2 September. The US dollar gained 1% against the pound, sending the value of Sterling to $1.2390. The greenback also rose significantly against the yen and the euro. The Mexican peso, which has recently become inversely linked to the probability of a Trump victory, jumped 2% against the dollar to 18.7 pesos to the dollar.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair\u2019s chief executive has said fares in Europe will fall heavily this winter as he criticised Theresa May for having no strategy for Brexit. Reporting results for the first half of the year, Michael O\u2019Leary said there would be \u201cextraordinary fare declines\u201d over the year. The short-haul airline\u2019s average fare fell 10% in the six months to the end of September, partly due to the conversion of sterling fares, which account for a quarter of its revenues, into euros. It predicted average fares would drop by 13-15% in the six months to the end of March. Ryanair said it cut fares in response to expansion by competitors and that lower fuel prices and cost cuts would help pay for the reductions. O\u2019Leary said Ryanair would aim to fill seats at whatever price it could sell them to gain market share. The airline claims its average fare, with one checked bag, is now \u20ac46 (\u00a341). In the medium term, however, a hard Brexit would push up air fares, O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWhat is inevitable \u2026 is that there would be less capacity in the UK \u2013 and that means higher prices.\u201d He said the company\u2019s first-half performance was creditable in a period marked by terrorist attacks, airport strikes and the effect of the Brexit vote. Pre-tax profit rose 6% to \u20ac1.31bn. He said falling prices were good news for travellers but his shareholders would have to wait to reap the benefits of Ryanair\u2019s growth. The airline increased its target for annual passengers in 2024 to 200 million from 180 million. The Dublin-based carrier said Brexit uncertainty was hanging over its business. It has scaled back plans to expand in the UK and shifted capacity to airports in Italy, Germany and Belgium. Last month, Ryanair said annual profit would be lower than expected due to the 18% fall in the value of the pound since the referendum on 23 June. O\u2019Leary, who campaigned against Britain leaving the EU, said Theresa May\u2019s government had no strategy for Brexit. \u201cThe UK government clearly has no idea what it\u2019s doing. It has no agenda in terms of negotiations. I don\u2019t think Mrs May or any of her ministers have any idea what they are doing. \u201cThe agenda will be set by the Europeans. There is no incentive on the Europeans to help her or to negotiate.\u201d He added that the government \u201cseem to be determined to make it up as they go along, and the economy is going to fall off a cliff in two years time. The UK economy is in real trouble. It hasn\u2019t collapsed because you haven\u2019t left yet.\u201d He warned that British competitors would have to restructure unless they could stay in the single European aviation market. \u201cOn the assumption they leave the open skies agreement, we probably can\u2019t operate the UK domestic routes. That\u2019s a small thing for us because we only have less than 1% of our capacity here. \u201cBut easyJet have over 40% of its capacity on intra-EU routes, which is probably unsustainable,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd IAG [the British Airways owner] gets broken up \u2013 you have foreign ownership restrictions as well as operating licences. It\u2019s what we call in the industry \u2018a regulatory clusterfuck\u2019.\u201d He criticised the government for having agreed a secret deal with Nissan while ignoring the aviation industry. O\u2019Leary said: \u201cThe airlines employ far more people in the UK than fucking Nissan does.\u201d The company\u2019s shares rose 5.3% to \u20ac13.44.",

    "webTitle": "UK online sellers warned over price fixing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The competition regulator has warned online traders against price fixing after finding evidence of collusion by sellers using internet marketplaces such as Amazon. The Competition and Markets Authority said it had written to several online companies that may be giving customers a bad deal by discussing prices with competitors or agreeing not to undercut them. The letters alerted the companies that the CMA had found signs of price fixing and required commitments to stop collusion. The watchdog has also provided a checklist of what price fixing is and how to avoid it. The CMA declined to say how many companies it had contacted or to give details about their size or the goods they sell. It said it expected the warnings would reduce collusion without the expense of a full investigation, but that it could still launch such an inquiry. The CMA sent its warnings as shoppers prepare for the Christmas season. The Black Friday discount period will kick off the frenzy on 25 November, with many shoppers buying online, including from traders on Amazon, eBay and other sites. Stephen Blake, senior director of the CMA\u2019s cartels and criminal group, said: \u201cOnline markets are a hugely valuable tool for consumers to shop around and find the best-value products, making the most of effective competition. But these benefits for shoppers are put at risk if the suppliers seek to restrict competition between them. Entering into agreements that limit price competition cheats consumers, is illegal and can have serious consequences for the companies and individuals involved.\u201d The CMA said its warnings were part of a wider clampdown on anti-competitive behaviour by online sellers. It fined Trod, which sells posters and frames on Amazon, \u00a3163,371 in July for agreeing with one of its competitors not to undercut each other\u2019s prices. Amazon was not involved in the cartel and was not investigated. In April, the CMA fined Ultra Finishing \u00a3826,000 for threatening online retailers with penalties if they charged below the company\u2019s recommended price for bathroom supplies. The CMA said online marketplaces were helping it distribute its advice to sellers. It did not name the marketplaces. Blake said: \u201cThe majority of online sellers want to comply with the law. As we enter the peak shopping months of November and December, sellers should make sure they have read our advice so they don\u2019t get caught out. The consequences for those who don\u2019t can be serious.\u201d",

But these benefits for shoppers are put at risk if the suppliers seek to restrict competition between them. Entering into agreements that limit price competition cheats consumers, is illegal and can have serious consequences for the companies and individuals involved.\u201d</p> <p>The CMA said its warnings were part of a wider clampdown on anti-competitive behaviour by online sellers. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/online-seller-admits-breaking-competition-law\">It fined Trod, which sells posters and frames on Amazon, \u00a3163,371 in July for agreeing with one of its competitors not to undercut each other\u2019s prices</a>.

It did not name the marketplaces.</p> <p>Blake said: \u201cThe majority of online sellers want to comply with the law. As we enter the peak shopping months of November and December, sellers should make sure they have read our advice so they don\u2019t get caught out. The consequences for those who don\u2019t can be serious.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "IT group Redcentric has seen its shares plunge 66% after it discovered accounting irregularities and gave notice to its finance director. The company said the \u201cmisstated accounting balances\u201d related to previous year\u2019s figures and would mean a write-down in some historic profits. The discrepancy meant it would need to reduce its net assets by at least \u00a310m and its debt would now be around \u00a330m, compared to the \u00a317m or so it suggested in September. It said: The company has served notice on its chief financial officer Tim Coleman and placed him on gardening leave with immediate effect. Mr Coleman resigned with immediate effect as a director of the company on 6 November. The board anticipates making an external interim appointmen of a replacement chief financial officer. Redcentric has begun a review of its current and historic balance sheets which will delay publication of its half year results which were due on 14 November. It will also need to recalculate its banking financial covenants \u201cwhich will take some time to complete.\u201d Chairman Chris Cole said: The board is absolutely focused on completing the internal review to resolve the situation in a timely manner and release the company\u2019s interim financial statements at the earliest time...The indications are that these accounting issues relate to prior periods and that the current levels of new business sales by the company are as expected. The company\u2019s shares are currently down 99p at 51p and analyst Will Wallis at its joint broker Numis said: This statement points to net debt being about \u00a313-14m higher at the half year than we had previously anticipated. The accounting misstatements that have led to this situation appear to have taken place over multiple previous periods, but we have no further information on the impacts in any one year. By comparison, previously reported adjusted pretax proit for 2016 was \u00a319.0m. If the cumulative profit restatement matches the mis-statement in net debt, and if 50% of the cumulative mis-statement took place in 2016, then the restatement to 2016 adjusted profits would be 35-40%. Note that this calculation is purely illustrative, and could differ very significantly from the eventual out-turn. The group also carries significant acquisition-related intangibles, which we presume could be subject to review. We have withdrawn our forecasts. The statement points to likely significant adjustments to previously announced profits. While the statement suggests that all issues relate to prior periods, it is very difficult given the likely scale of restatement to have any confidence in our previous forecasts for the current year and beyond. The statement notes a recalculation of banking financial covenants. We understand that the primary covenants are net debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times, and a debt service covenant of 1.1 times (pre interest post capex cash flow compared to all debt service costs including interest, finance lease repayments and dividends). He concluded: We have withdrawn our recommendation and price target. With audited results (auditors PwC), including the level of net debt, not reliable, clearly there are very significant uncertainties.",

      "body": "<p>IT group <strong>Redcentric</strong> has seen its shares plunge 66% after it discovered accounting irregularities and gave notice to its finance director.</p> <p>The company said the \u201cmisstated accounting balances\u201d related to previous year\u2019s figures and would mean a write-down in some historic profits.</p> <p>The discrepancy meant it would need to reduce its net assets by at least \u00a310m and its debt would now be around \u00a330m, compared to the \u00a317m or so it suggested in September. It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The company has served notice on its chief financial officer Tim Coleman and placed him on gardening leave with immediate effect. Mr Coleman resigned with immediate effect as a director of the company on 6 November. The board anticipates making an external interim appointmen of a replacement chief financial officer.</p> </blockquote> <p>Redcentric has begun a review of its current and historic balance sheets which will delay publication of its half year results which were due on 14 November.</p> <p>It will also need to recalculate its banking financial covenants \u201cwhich will take some time to complete.\u201d Chairman Chris Cole said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The board is absolutely focused on completing the internal review to resolve the situation in a timely manner and release the company\u2019s interim financial statements at the earliest time...The indications are that these accounting issues relate to prior periods and that the current levels of new business sales by the company are as expected.</p> </blockquote> <p>The company\u2019s shares are currently down 99p at 51p and analyst Will Wallis at its joint broker Numis said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This statement points to net debt being about \u00a313-14m higher at the half year than we had previously anticipated. The accounting misstatements that have led to this situation appear to have taken place over multiple previous periods, but we have no further information on the impacts in any one year. By comparison, previously reported adjusted pretax proit for 2016 was \u00a319.0m. If the cumulative profit restatement matches the mis-statement in net debt, and if 50% of the cumulative mis-statement took place in 2016, then the restatement to 2016 adjusted profits would be 35-40%. Note that this calculation is purely illustrative, and could differ very significantly from the eventual out-turn. The group also carries significant acquisition-related intangibles, which we presume could be subject to review.</p> <p>We have withdrawn our forecasts. The statement points to likely significant adjustments to previously announced profits. While the statement suggests that all issues relate to prior periods, it is very difficult given the likely scale of restatement to have any confidence in our previous forecasts for the current year and beyond.</p> <p>The statement notes a recalculation of banking financial covenants. We understand that the primary covenants are net debt to EBITDA of 2.5 times, and a debt service covenant of 1.1 times (pre interest post capex cash flow compared to all debt service costs including interest, finance lease repayments and dividends).</p> </blockquote> <p>He concluded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have withdrawn our recommendation and price target. With audited results (auditors PwC), including the level of net debt, not reliable, clearly there are very significant uncertainties. </p> </blockquote>",

Some of these technologies are more advanced than others but a few are on the verge of delivering real benefits to consumers and companies alike. Demand-side response This involves energy-intensive businesses such as factories or retailers shifting their energy use to times when demand on the grid is low, which also saves those businesses money. Demand response specialist Open Energi counts Sainsbury\u2019s among its clients. The supermarket chain\u2019s fridges use a lot of energy to keep products cool in its warehouses and supermarkets but do not need to run 24 hours a day. A chip installed in a fridge can assess when energy demand is high and arrange for the fridge to switch off during that period. This helps reduce overall capacity demand and is also useful for \u201cfrequency response\u201d, when the grid needs to make second-by-second adjustments to keep the power network stable. These devices can be connected across the country too, allowing the system to be managed at a national level. Smart meters Smart meters in the home will be capable of monitoring our energy usage in real time and the government aims to roll them out to all houses who want them by 2020. Eventually this will allow power suppliers to offer a tariff that allows you to manage your energy usage to reduce bills. This could be done manually or automatically, with smart appliances deciding, for instance, to do the washing when power prices are low. Battery storage This technology is advancing rapidly and could transform energy use. At the moment, there are limited ways to store electricity when power generators are producing a surplus. But battery technology means electricity could be siphoned into a battery and 80% of it, or even more, released when needed. This also makes wind and solar more efficient because they could store electricity for release when the weather conditions are unfavourable. Home batteries US electric vehicle maker Tesla is among firms offering a battery for domestic use. Its Powerwall product envisages a world where people have solar panels that provide more energy than their house needs. The Powerwall would suck up excess electricity and hold enough backup power to last a day or more. The UK\u2019s first Powerwall was installed in Wales earlier this year. Electric vehicles Some experts believe a national fleet of electric vehicles could operate as a form of battery. Electric car owners could theoretically sell some of the electricity stored in their batteries back into the grid (\u00a3) when their vehicles are not needed. However, there is limited evidence on whether this is feasible and questions over what would happen if you needed your car unexpectedly, just when the grid was draining power from it.",

      "bodyText": "British manufacturers have fanned fears that the economy is heading for a slowdown in 2017 after a survey showed a rise in factory bosses putting off plans to increase investment. Since the EU referendum there has been a sharp rise in the proportion of executives saying political uncertainty is putting them off raising spending, according to a poll by the manufacturers\u2019 organisation the EEF. It found a quarter of manufacturers cited this as a reason when asked in the wake of the vote, up sharply from 6% when the referendum campaign was getting under way in March. The report comes days after the Bank of England renewed warnings that the British economy would slow next year, although it was forced to admit that its earlier fears of a severe near-term slowdown had proved unfounded. It also warned that slower corporate spending and a squeeze on household incomes would hit growth further out. The EEF\u2019s report found manufacturers would be likely to pare back their investment in plant and machinery over the next two years in response to growing worries about the prospects for demand as well as the spike in political uncertainty. According to the survey, 60% of manufacturers planned to spend the same or less over the next two years, up from 54% in 2015. The poll of 306 companies was conducted in August. Since then, the Conservative party signalled at its October conference that the government would go for a hard Brexit deal that leaves the UK shut out of Europe\u2019s single market. The EEF report, carried out with the bank group Santander, also echoed other surveys that have pointed to an export boost for some firms as the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the referendum has made their goods more competitive in overseas markets. Manufacturers\u2019 views of export prospects improved between March and August on the back of better demand in Europe and the United States, the EEF said. But that was offset by firms becoming more pessimistic about the prospects for the domestic outlook. The EEF chief economist Lee Hopley said fears of an immediate collapse in business investment appeared to be unfounded for now and that UK manufacturers had been investing at a \u201chealthy pace\u201d in recent years. She added: \u201cBut the spike in political risk should not go unnoticed. There is caution amongst businesses, which will inevitably make it more difficult to get big decisions across the line.\u201d The threat to business investment and companies\u2019 hiring intentions increases the onus on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to use his autumn statement later this month, when he will set out the government\u2019s tax and spending plans, to shore up confidence. Hopley added: \u201cIt\u2019s over to the autumn statement now to press ahead with policies that further enhance the UK business environment for spending on modern machinery and increasingly important intangible investment.\u201d Economic indicators since the referendum have largely defied early predicions of a post-vote slowdown as consumers have continued to spend, unemployment has remained low and the housing market has held steady, for now. The Bank of England followed City economists last week in revising away its forecasts for the economy to grind to a halt in the run-up to Christmas. But many experts warn that this is merely the calm before the storm and the real effects of the landmark vote to leave the EU will be felt after Brexit negotiations begin in earnest next year. The Bank is more optimistic on the near-term than it was in August and expects GDP growth of 2.2% this year but still expects a stretch of relatively subdued growth of around 1.5% each year between 2017 and 2019 (pdf). A separate report on Monday underscores the scale of unease among businesses over the UK\u2019s longer-term prospects. Businesses are preparing for a slowdown in profit growth and domestic sales in the next 12 months, according to a regular check on corporate confidence from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). Confidence remained fragile in most sectors and business services and financial firms had seen the largest drop in sentiment on the back of growing fears of a hard Brexit, according the report, which used responses from 1,000 chartered accountants given from 26 July to 21 October. With the weak pound pushing up inflation, thanks to higher import costs in the UK, companies are wary about raising pay and taking on new staff, the poll found. The average total salary growth expected in the next 12 months was just 1.6%. That compares with the Bank\u2019s forecasts for inflation at a much higher 2.7% next year. If both forecasts prove correct, it would mean earnings fall in real terms. Michael Izza, the ICAEW chief executive, said that a likely squeeze on households put companies in a difficult position. \u201cThe chancellor should be under no illusion at the pressure UK businesses are experiencing. Inflationary burdens are pushing up costs but companies know that customers will not accept higher prices,\u201d he said.",

    "webTitle": "Smart energy technology 'stymied by current policy'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Smart technology that could shave \u00a390 off household energy bills and curb carbon emissions is being stymied by government policy, a leading thinktank has said. In a wide-ranging report, Policy Exchange also claimed that current energy policy offered too many incentives to build polluting diesel generator farms at the expense of cleaner technology. The thinktank pointed to an estimate by the government\u2019s National Infrastructure Commission that a smarter, more flexible power grid \u2013 which would allow businesses to store power and shift usage to less busy times of day \u2013 could reduce energy costs by \u00a38bn by 2030. \u201cMaking the power system smarter will mean it can provide cheaper and cleaner electricity,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Richard Howard. \u201cThe current set of policies is encouraging a growth in dirty diesel generators \u2013 exacerbating air pollution in UK cities and towns. The government needs to level the playing field to encourage the use of cleaner technologies such as demand response and storage.\u201d Demand response involves large energy users, such as factories, using power at times when there is less strain on the National Grid. This reduces the need for the Grid to ask fossil fuel energy firms to turn up the power at times when the risk of blackouts is increasing. Firms that provide demand response technology to large companies are unable to bid for Grid contracts lasting more than one year in the annual capacity market auction, because they do not fit the current criteria. But large coal power stations and even diesel farms, a heavily polluting source of power, are able to bid for contracts lasting up to 15 years. Policy Exchange also advocated lower carbon taxes on battery storage, where surplus electricity is saved and released at a later date when it is needed. It called for greater penalties for emissions released by diesel generators, which currently receive payments to be on standby to keep the lights on, as well as separate subsidies. And the thinktank said rules set by the energy regulator, Ofgem, should be changed to encourage local power networks to use battery storage, rather than building new power lines. It said these measures, among others, could hand households a boost by cutting up to \u00a390 from energy bills by 2030, while also making renewable technology more viable. Technologies such as solar and wind power do not produce energy when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. But greater use of battery storage would allow renewable power firms to store their electricity to be released when conditions aren\u2019t right for them to produce. Experts say this would reduce the need to build large fossil-fuel-burning power plants, which are still needed to provide a more reliable source of power. Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: \u201cThis report is the latest in a long series of calls for the government to enable flexible technology to compete on equal footing with existing power stations. This will reduce the number of power stations that need to be built only to operate for a few hours per year, and increase the opportunity for UK businesses to take control of their energy bills, using electricity when it is at its cheapest and opening new streams of income, as well as helping Britain meet its climate change targets at the lowest possible cost.\u201d While industrial energy usage offers the biggest scope for reducing electricity demand, Policy Exchange also pointed to the potential benefits from fitting homes with smart meters. The government has set a target of 2020 to fit every home in the UK with a smart meter, a box installed in the home that can monitor energy usage in real time. Howard said these could help ease the burden on the Grid and cut energy bills because suppliers could offer \u201ctime-in-use\u201d tariffs that charge customers based partly on when they use their energy. Power suppliers buy some of their electricity at short notice in the wholesale markets, where prices change depending on how much demand there is. If customers use energy at low-demand times, it limits the amount that suppliers need to buy when prices are high. \u201cAppliances are coming to the market that could be connected to the internet to run when energy is cheaper,\u201d said Howard. \u201cIt\u2019s all technically possible.\u201d Ofgem said it would be publishing a call for evidence on smart power networks that would look at electricity storage and demand response. \u201cProgress towards smarter grids is already being made,\u201d the regulator said, adding that it was looking into subsidies for diesel generators. \u201cSome diesel plants receive additional payments for generating during times of peak demand, in addition to the wholesale price of power.

      "body": "<p>Smart technology that could shave \u00a390 off household energy bills and curb carbon emissions is being stymied by government policy, a leading thinktank has said.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging report, <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/\">Policy Exchange</a> also claimed that current energy policy offered too many incentives to build polluting diesel generator farms at the expense of cleaner technology. The thinktank pointed to an estimate by the government\u2019s National Infrastructure Commission that a smarter, more flexible power grid \u2013 which would allow businesses to store power and shift usage to less busy times of day \u2013 could <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/a-smart-power-revolution-could-save-consumers-8-billion-a-year-adonis\">reduce energy costs by \u00a38bn</a> by 2030.</p> <p>\u201cMaking the power system smarter will mean it can provide cheaper and cleaner electricity,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Richard Howard. \u201cThe current set of policies is encouraging a growth in dirty diesel generators \u2013 exacerbating air pollution in UK cities and towns. The government needs to level the playing field to encourage the use of cleaner technologies such as demand response and storage.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/demand-response-europe-policy\">Demand response</a> involves large energy users, such as factories, using power at times when there is less strain on the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nationalgrid\">National Grid</a>.</p> <p>This reduces the need for the Grid to ask fossil fuel energy firms to turn up the power at times when the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/oct/14/winter-electricity-blackouts-risk-recedes-says-national-grid\">risk of blackouts</a> is increasing. Firms that provide demand response technology to large companies are unable to bid for Grid contracts lasting more than one year in the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/governments-plan-secure-power-generation-capacity-market-unfit-purpose-ippr-report\">annual capacity market auction</a>, because they do not fit the current criteria. But large coal power stations and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/17/diesel-farms-set-win-lucrative-contracts-back-up-national-grid\">even diesel farms</a>, a heavily polluting source of power, are able to bid for contracts lasting up to 15 years.</p> <p>Policy Exchange also advocated lower carbon taxes on battery storage, where surplus electricity is saved and released at a later date when it is needed.</p> <p>It called for greater penalties for emissions released by diesel generators, which currently receive payments to be on standby to keep the lights on, as well as separate subsidies.</p> <p>And the thinktank said rules set by the energy regulator, Ofgem, should be changed to encourage local power networks to use battery storage, rather than building new power lines. It said these measures, among others, could hand households a boost by cutting up to \u00a390 from energy bills by 2030, while also making renewable technology more viable.</p> <p>Technologies such as solar and wind power do not produce energy when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. But greater use of battery storage would allow renewable power firms to store their electricity to be released when conditions aren\u2019t right for them to produce. Experts say this would reduce the need to build large fossil-fuel-burning power plants, which are still needed to provide a more reliable source of power.</p> <p>Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: \u201cThis report is the latest in a long series of calls for the government to enable flexible technology to compete on equal footing with existing power stations. This will reduce the number of power stations that need to be built only to operate for a few hours per year, and increase the opportunity for UK businesses to take control of their energy bills, using electricity when it is at its cheapest and opening new streams of income, as well as helping Britain meet its climate change targets at the lowest possible cost.\u201d</p> <p>While industrial energy usage offers the biggest scope for reducing electricity demand, Policy Exchange also pointed to the potential benefits from fitting homes with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/smart-meter-energy-saving-revolution-cut-bills-gas-electricity\">smart meters</a>. The government has set a target of 2020 to fit every home in the UK with a smart meter, a box installed in the home that can monitor energy usage in real time. </p> <p>Howard said these could help ease the burden on the Grid and cut energy bills because suppliers could offer \u201ctime-in-use\u201d tariffs that charge customers based partly on when they use their energy.</p> <p>Power suppliers buy some of their electricity at short notice in the wholesale markets, where prices change depending on how much demand there is. If customers use energy at low-demand times, it limits the amount that suppliers need to buy when prices are high.</p> <p>\u201cAppliances are coming to the market that could be connected to the internet to run when energy is cheaper,\u201d said Howard. \u201cIt\u2019s all technically possible.\u201d</p> <p>Ofgem said it would be publishing a call for evidence on smart power networks that would look at electricity storage and demand response.</p> <p>\u201cProgress towards smarter grids is already being made,\u201d the regulator said, adding that it was looking into subsidies for diesel generators. \u201cSome diesel plants receive additional payments for generating during times of peak demand, in addition to the wholesale price of power. We have set out our concerns on this as we believe it is distorting the market. We are now considering the responses.\u201d</p>",
