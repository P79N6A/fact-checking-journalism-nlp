      "bodyText": "This year's Christmas blockbuster looks likely to be the first part of the Hobbit trilogy, which is released this week. JRR Tolkien's prequel to the Lord of the Rings follows the story of Bilbo Baggins, plucked from his comfortable life in the Shire to accompany treasure-seeking dwarves on an adventure. Tolkien became a cult figure among hippies in the 1960s, for whom LOTR worked on a number of levels: peace-lovers versus warmongers; military-industrial complex versus local smallholders; the lust for power versus individual freedom. These days he would have celebrated the victory of the people of Totnes in their campaign to keep a branch of Costa out of their town. Yet those who believe in a small state and self-regulated markets could also claim Tolkien as one of their own. The Shire had hardly any government: families, for the most part, managed their own affairs and the only real official was the mayor, who oversaw the postal service and the watch. Hobbits enjoyed a pipe and a mug of ale: it is unlikely Tolkien would have been a fan of smoking bans and minimum unit prices for alcohol. Like Elinor Ostrom, he might even have been invited to deliver the Hayek lecture at the UK's bastion of free-market thinking, the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA). Ostrom, who died this year, became the first woman to win the Nobel prize for economics in 2009. Her work on the governance of common-pool resources, such as forests and fisheries, was based on studying communities to see what worked rather than on highly complex models. She concluded there was no \"one right\" way to do things but, in the main, the best solutions were where communities developed their own approach to managing common resources. This was a message that went down well with those on the left for whom what has become known as the \"tragedy of the commons\" in the developing world is the result of privatisation, which has allowed companies to deplete resources in pursuit of short-term profitability. But Ostrom was no great fan of big government either. She considered the EU's common fisheries policy an unmitigated disaster, viewing with horror the attempt to have one set of rules from the Mediterranean to the Baltic. This went down rather well with economic liberals, and helps explain why the IEA is publishing a monograph based on Ostrom's Hayek lecture. This explores whether there is a way of managing the commons that avoids the perils of market failure and of government regulation. Interestingly, it contains commentaries both from free-marketeers such as Mark Pennington of King's College London and from Christina Chang of the Catholic aid agency Cafod. Ostrom would have been pleased by this rare meeting of minds across the political spectrum. She talked about the \"panacea problem\" \u2013 policymakers' belief that there was a \"best way\" of doing things. \"For many purposes, if the market was not the best way, people used to think that the government was the best way. We need to get away from thinking about very broad terms that do not give us the specific detail that is needed to really know what we are talking about,\" she said. Governance systems that worked in practice were not those that stemmed from a theory of what ought to work but had, on the contrary, evolved from local conditions. \"There is a huge diversity out there, and the range of governance systems that work reflects that diversity. We have found that government-, private- and community-based mechanisms all work in some settings.\" While careful not to fall into the trap of saying community-based systems always work best, Ostrom says there are many examples of local solutions that have husbanded resources carefully and avoided ecological damage. Her work suggests community-based approaches work best when there are clear boundaries to the resource \u2013 the pasture contained in a Swiss Alpine valley, for example \u2013 and where the local people draw up rules they deem appropriate, police them, and have an accepted mechanism for settling disputes and punishing those who transgress. Self-organisation tends to work if there is a high level of trust and if the communities are allowed to develop their own rules. They then tend to be concerned about ensuring that the resource still exists for future generations, thus avoiding over-exploitation. Local monitoring is crucial, Ostrom she suggests. \"The local people pay attention to what is happening in the forest if they have some rights to collect.\" It is easy to see why Ostrom appeals to those on the left who believe in localism and collective solutions to problems that are not administered by the state. What is less obvious is why a body like the IEA should be excited by her work. The answer, according to the thinktank's editorial director, Philip Booth, is that \"in no sense do Professor Ostrom's ideas conflict with the idea of a free economy\". \"To the left, perhaps, the community management of a resource is the acceptable face of a free economy like a mutual bank or co-operative retail outlet, but it is no less free for that,\" he adds. If there is a congruence of thinking between left and right exemplified by Ostrom, it is in the concern about \"bigness\" in all its forms. Her message is that policies that go with the grain of local communities tend to work, while those that rely on the restraint of multinational corporations or the wisdom of officials tend not to. In the question-and-answer session at the end of her lecture, Ostrom was asked whether it was possible to adapt an approach that worked for the management of fisheries and forests to tackling climate change. While the commonly held view is that global warming can only be handled effectively by governments, Ostrom said this was a mistake and it was important to encourage action at the local level. She welcomed the fact that 1,000 mayors in US cities had signed an agreement to start working on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adding: \"I am very nervous about just sitting around and waiting and making the argument that the rest of us can't do anything at all.\" Let's be clear. For the most part, the world is not run along the lines suggested by Ostrom. It is overfished, increasingly deforested, ravaged by those who care nothing about resource management and local communities, dominated by dogmatists who think they know best. But there's something heartening about an economist who doesn't claim to have all the answers and who suggests there is a different way of doing things.

Local monitoring is crucial, Ostrom she suggests. \"The local people pay attention to what is happening in the forest if they have some rights to collect.\"</p> <p>It is easy to see why Ostrom appeals to those on the left who believe in localism and collective solutions to problems that are not administered by the state. What is less obvious is why a body like the IEA should be excited by her work. The answer, according to the thinktank's editorial director, Philip Booth, is that \"in no sense do Professor Ostrom's ideas conflict with the idea of a free economy\".</p> <p>\"To the left, perhaps, the community management of a resource is the acceptable face of a free economy like a mutual bank or co-operative retail outlet, but it is no less free for that,\" he adds. If there is a congruence of thinking between left and right exemplified by Ostrom, it is in the concern about \"bigness\" in all its forms. Her message is that policies that go with the grain of local communities tend to work, while those that rely on the restraint of multinational corporations or the wisdom of officials tend not to.</p> <p>In the question-and-answer session at the end of her lecture, Ostrom was asked whether it was possible to adapt an approach that worked for the management of fisheries and forests to tackling climate change. While the commonly held view is that global warming can only be handled effectively by governments, Ostrom said this was a mistake and it was important to encourage action at the local level. She welcomed the fact that 1,000 mayors in US cities had signed an agreement to start working on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adding: \"I am very nervous about just sitting around and waiting and making the argument that the rest of us can't do anything at all.\"</p> <p>Let's be clear. For the most part, the world is not run along the lines suggested by Ostrom. It is overfished, increasingly deforested, ravaged by those who care nothing about resource management and local communities, dominated by dogmatists who think they know best. But there's something heartening about an economist who doesn't claim to have all the answers and who suggests there is a different way of doing things.</p> <p><em>The Future of the Commons; Elinor Ostrom et al; The Institute of Economic Affairs; iea.org.uk</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's housing crisis and the resulting rise of a generation locked out of home ownership is destroying community spirit and preventing young people from building careers, forming relationships and starting families, according to research from a thinktank. The findings by the Institute for Public Policy Research were announced as Labour prepares to launch a review of the private rental sector, looking at ways to make tenancies more secure and rents more affordable. \"Generation rent\" is here to stay, said the IPPR. By 2020, the number of 18- to 30-year-old homeowners will have fallen by 1.1 million to 1.3 million. People in their 30s living with their parents will rise by 500,000 and an extra 1.5 million people aged 18 to 30 will live in privately rented properties. The study, which focuses on the social impact of this transformation, says 85% of 18- to 30-year-olds want to own their own home. However, the report said that when young people were \"unable to see how this aspiration can be fulfilled, a sense of frustration sets in. Current options were seen to be stifling ambition, career goals and family plans.\" More than one in five sharing a house said it made them feel insecure. Dalia Ben-Galim, associate director at IPPR, said: \"Our analysis shows that the lack of houses is dragging young people down. A huge majority of today's younger generation want to own their home, just as most of their parents have done. But the prospect is slipping ever further over the horizon. Insecure renting stops them from putting down roots, but it is bad for society, too.\" The impact of renting on communities is also examined in a report to be published by Labour this week. The party believes that the private rented sector is failing both renters and landlords. Jack Dromey, the shadow housing minister, says he wants to send an \"unmistakable message\" that the sector needs to change and he will be consulting charities, thinktanks and housing experts on ways to do this. Mark Prisk, the housing minister, said: \"For those looking to buy, our FirstBuy scheme offers a valuable alternative to the bank of mum and dad, while the NewBuy scheme enables people to buy newly built homes with a fraction of the deposit they would normally require. But we also need to build more affordable homes, which is why \u2026 we're investing \u00a319.5bn of public and private funding into an affordable housing programme set to deliver 170,000 new homes.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Major British stores may think twice before trying to break into the US market after Tesco, the UK's largest retailer, last week admitted its American dream was over. The supermarket has appointed advisers to \"review\" the future of its Fresh &amp; Easy stores in California, Arizona and Nevada after running up more than \u00a31.5bn of investment bills and accumulated losses in five years. Such a review usually means finding a partner to share the costs, an outright sale or a shutdown; chief executive Philip Clarke has conceded that the probable outcome is that Tesco will exit the US. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail analysts Conlumino, says: \"If a player with the resources, scale and expertise of Tesco can't make it, what hope is there for everyone else?\" Indeed, Tesco is only the latest British retailer to have attempted to leap over the pond \u2013 and drowned. The past couple of decades have seen rival supermarket Sainsbury's, as well as Marks &amp; Spencer, WH Smith, Dixons and HMV all forced to beat a retreat. Some have underestimated the costs of breaking into such a large and highly competitive market; others took on stores that were far too expensive or, like Tesco, hit the US just as it headed for economic downturn. Many past transatlantic ventures have been the victim of arrogance and poor preparation, failing to understand the surprising differences between US and British shoppers. We may, broadly, speak the same language, listen to the same music and watch the same films, but other tastes and habits can differ quite dramatically. Tesco spent 20 years considering a move into the US market, and put in two years of intensive on-the-ground research, even sending senior executives to live with Californian families to observe the way they shopped and ate. They built secret test stores and investigated the contents of Americans' fridges. But experts say Tesco then ignored much of that research, deciding to set up the stores it wanted, rather than listening to its potential customers. For example, although US shoppers prefer to buy in bulk to save money, Fresh &amp; Easy offered small pack sizes. The stores also stocked British-style ready meals unfamiliar to US shoppers and initially relied heavily on self-service tills. This was a big turn-off to American customers, who value good service. Like many British retailers before it, Tesco also struggled to get the right kind of stores in the right places. It had planned to open several hundred small stores very quickly; it needed 500 outlets to justify its investment in a US food factory and a vast warehouse. But as sales stumbled at the first Fresh &amp; Easy branches, Tesco had to invest money in improving existing stores rather than opening new ones. Even finding properties was tricky. As an incomer, any British retailer is fighting for locations with established competitors. According to experts, Tesco got some of its locations wrong, opening aspirational grocery stores in low-income areas. Saunders says: \"Tesco wasn't able to find enough stores close to its distribution centre. It's difficult in a very crowded and competitive market, with a lot of players doing a good job.\" What's more, as news of Tesco's arrival broke the local competition responded. US grocery giant Walmart hired David Wild, a former Tesco executive, and Aldi USA, an arm of the German discount grocer, also revealed that it was planning a string of stores in California, Fresh &amp; Easy's heartland. But one source who knows the retailer well says Tesco's US adventure was most severely hit by the timing of the sub-prime crisis and the subsequent global economic downturn. Las Vegas, one of Fresh &amp; Easy's target cities, had been the fastest-growing metropolis in the US but soon turned into its repossession capital. In 2009, 12% of the city's residents received a foreclosure notice. Phoenix, Arizona, another focus for Fresh &amp; Easy, was also particularly hard hit by the housing crash. Fresh &amp; Easy's upscale heat-and-eat dinners were never going to be top of the weekly shopping list for US families struggling to pay their mortgages and keep their jobs. But some British companies have been here before: WH Smith had to sell its stores in American hotels and airports amid the travel and retail downturn that followed the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001. US retailers, however, see the current downturn as an opportunity to pile into the UK. Chains including fashion stores Forever 21 and Hollister and lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret have snapped up outlets abandoned by British retailers suffering from poor sales and a switch to the internet. And Michelle Obama's favourite label, J Crew, is also looking for a store in London. They are following in the footsteps of Gap, the now-ubiquitous clothing retailer, and Walmart, which owns Britain's second-largest supermarket, Asda. Companies from Apple to Banana Republic and Urban Outfitters also seem to have settled into the UK quite comfortably. Many of these successful interlopers are fashion stores, who are able to offer the British public something truly different. This same advantage has helped some British retailers do well over the Atlantic, including Topshop, Ted Baker and Burberry. Generally US retailers have been able to exploit their bigger resources to adapt to the British market, tweaking their ranges, store size and pricing to suit. But it is hard for British retailers to match their financial power. Taking on the huge US market can drain not only financial resources but management time too. Dave McCarthy, a retail analyst at Investec, says: \"Tesco sent the A team to run the US operation and, by definition, that left behind the B team running the UK side.\" Tim Mason, Tesco's deputy chief executive, moved to California to run Fresh &amp; Easy. He was also the grocer's marketing supremo, the man who dreamed up the Clubcard and built the brand's classless image in the UK. He kept that top marketing role even when he was in Los Angeles \u2013 5,000 miles away from Tesco's core domestic market \u2013 and the brand's image at home took a substantial battering. Many of the UK stores need revamping, the chain's prices are no longer viewed as the sharpest, and service levels have been allowed to slide. This is all a result of investment in British stores being put on the back burner as profits from home were poured into the US business. McCarthy says it is no coincidence that many British retailers have failed across the Atlantic at a time when they are struggling at home. Both Sainsbury's and Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, were forced to sell off their US businesses as they dealt with problems in the UK. \"It's a chicken-and-egg situation. Is it the distraction of going overseas that means management is no longer focused on the home market, or failure at home that drags down the business overseas?\" asks McCarthy. Still, a business the size of Tesco has to take calculated risks from time to time or risk stagnating. After five years of trying, Tesco did manage to turn Fresh &amp; Easy into a store that enjoyed higher sales per square metre than a typical US supermarket, which shows it wasn't rejected outright by US shoppers. McCarthy says: \"I still honestly believe that if they had used the right strategy they could have got it right, and blown the market apart.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Last week's cave-in by Starbucks, which has agreed to pay \u00a320m in corporation tax over the next two years, was one of those giddying moments when grassroots campaigners get a taste of their own power. The US-based corporation, which is blamed for driving hundreds of independent cafes out of business, appeared to decide that avoiding a consumer boycott \u2013 and being seen as a corporate baddie \u2013 was worth \u00a320m. But aside from revealing how sensitive even multinationals are to jibes about ethics, the move underlines the arbitrariness of the international tax code. A new paper from the Tax Justice Network by Professor Sol Picciotto of Lancaster University suggests ditching the long-established \"arm's-length principle\" under which multinationals are allowed to treat subsidiaries in different companies as distinct firms, and pay tax accordingly. \"The present system treats transnational corporations [TNCs] as if they were loose collections of separate entities,\" he says in the study. \"There is currently only weak co-ordination between tax authorities, and this 'separate entity' approach gives TNCs tremendous scope to shift profits around the globe.\" The system was devised in the 1930s, when it was far simpler to discern which activities a firm was carrying out and where. Today, with supply chains strung across the globe, and company accounts including intangibles such as goodwill and intellectual property, it is much more difficult for tax authorities to apportion economic activities \u2013 and profits \u2013 to one jurisdiction or another. With help from well-paid advisers, international companies use a network of \"transfer payments\" between subsidiaries. The UK arm of Starbucks, for example, pays hefty \"royalties\" to its operation in Luxembourg \u2013 a conveniently low-tax location \u2013 for use of the Starbucks brand. While this is completely legal, it is all but impossible for HM Revenue &amp; Customs to establish whether such payments are being made at a fair price. Picciotto argues instead that multinationals should be taxed \"not according to the legal forms that their tax advisers create, but according to the genuine economic substance of what they do and where they do it\". He says tax authorities should insist on \"unitary\" accounts, showing a multinational's worldwide operations. They could then assess where their profits are really made, using three factors: the number of staff the company employs in each country; its fixed assets, such as factories and machines; and its sales. That would prevent large profits being attributed to, say, Luxembourg or Ireland if there is nothing there but a glitzy headquarters and a few staff. Use of this unitary approach has a colourful precedent: the US state of California used it for decades from the 1930s to prevent Hollywood film studios from routing profits through lower-tax Nevada. Picciotto offers the example of Amazon, which claims that all its UK affiliate does is order-fulfilment, deliveries and logistics; sales are actually made by its Luxembourg operation, where most of its profits are booked (though George Osborne's latest cut in corporation tax, to 21%, means the rate in the UK will be the same as that in Luxembourg's from 2014). He says: \"A unitary approach would recognise that the profits are due to the synergies of all aspects of Amazon's operations: websites, order fulfilment, customer support and other services. The overall profit would be apportioned according to the number of people employed, value of physical assets, and sales to customers, in each country.\" This would \"ensure that they make a fair contribution as corporate citizens towards the costs of the public services provided by the states where they do business\". The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, for many years the body charged with co-ordinating international efforts towards tax reform, has promised to report to G20 finance ministers in February with proposals for change. Its director of tax, Pascal Saint-Amans, insists he is planning a radical rewrite, but says it would be impossible to reach international agreement on unitary taxation, with complex details being argued over in many countries. Europe's policymakers have, he says, been trying to agree rules for defining the base for corporation tax. \"I think they have another 150 years before putting it in place.\" But John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network disagrees: \"The OECD must now abandon its efforts to tweak the outdated arm's-length method. Multinational companies dominate the global economy, and their profits should be apportioned to the countries where real economic activity occurs.\"",

    "webTitle": "UK Uncut protesters shut down Starbucks shops", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tax campaigners targeted scores of Starbucks coffee shops across Britain yesterday, briefly disrupting business on one of the chain's busiest trading days as they sought to highlight the Seattle-based group's minimal contributions to the UK exchequer. Organisers from UK Uncut claimed to have targeted more than 40 shops \u2013 including Starbucks in Liverpool, Cardiff, Bristol and Shrewsbury \u2013 on the campaign group's biggest day of action to date. They were protesting against aggressive accounting measures that have allowed Starbucks to pay just \u00a38.6m in tax since launching in the UK 14 years ago. The action went ahead despite an unprecedented promise last week from Starbucks' UK boss, Kris Engskov, to overpay on the group's British tax bill by \u00a320m over the next two years. \"Our customers have been very vocal over the past six or seven weeks,\" he told Sky News. \"This is clearly an issue which has struck a chord with the country.\" A handful of stores, including two in London's busy West End shopping district, were briefly closed down around noon yesterday, and police threatened to arrest sit-in protesters for aggravated trespass. Organisers from UK Uncut had hoped to attract 1,000 protesters to Starbucks stores across the country. At a flagship store just off Regent Street's busy shopping parades, about 40 activists and six children had joined the action. The protest then moved to Vigo Street, another side road off Regent Street, where about 60 campaigners gathered among customers sipping lattes and herbal tea, chanting: \"If you don't pay your taxes, we'll shut you down.\" Zara Martin, 33, a protester who was handing out leaflets in the branch, said: \"Everyone is being really quite cheerful and the response from passersby is great, they are all smiley and interested in what we are doing. It's very encouraging. \"Even if people don't agree, it's important that we're having the debate. I think the \u00a320m over two years is a bit rubbish. It's like, wow thanks Starbucks, but actually why don't you just pay your full tax like everyone else has to?\" Customer Paula McCaully, 42, with her partner Ian, said: \"I was hoping for a coffee, but [the protesters] are right, of course, and we will boycott and get our coffee somewhere else, I think. Good for them, coming out on a cold day to stand up for what they believe in.\" The co-ordinated action against Starbucks was the latest in a string of protests which have thrown a spotlight on the complex and opaque world of tax treatments for multinational corporations. Others to be targeted have included Topshop and Vodafone. Acknowledging the level of public feeling, in his autumn statement last Wednesday George Osborne promised to make international reform of corporation tax \"an important priority\" when Britain takes the G8 presidency next year. Meanwhile, the top tax expert at the OECD, the body responsible for overseeing the tax rules, conceded that abusive \u2014 but legal \u2014 behaviour among multinationals was a big, and worsening, problem. Pascal Saint-Amans told the Observer there is a \"large and growing gap\" between where firms carry out most of their activities and where they record their profits. \"Guess what? The location of the economic activities is in higher tax jurisdictions, but the location of the profits is in lower tax jurisdictions,\" he said. He said tackling the holes in the international tax system had become a growing priority, even among those countries \u2013 including the UK \u2013 that had previously been sceptical about reform. \"What's new is that this has been acknowledged, recognised, and it has become a political concern.\" The OECD's tax committee, which Saint-Amans chairs, is due to report to the G20 finance ministers in February with a set of proposals aimed at making the system fairer. Saint-Amans urges G20 countries to work together towards an agreed system of defining profits and where they are made, instead of battling each other over who gets what share. \"We are fighting to share a pie which is getting smaller and smaller, so let's work together to make sure the pie doesn't get smaller \u2013 and then we share it.\"",

      "body": "<p>Tax campaigners targeted scores of Starbucks coffee shops across Britain yesterday, briefly disrupting business on one of the chain's busiest trading days as they sought to highlight the Seattle-based group's minimal contributions to the UK exchequer.</p> <p>Organisers from UK Uncut claimed to have targeted more than 40 shops \u2013 including Starbucks in Liverpool, Cardiff, Bristol and Shrewsbury \u2013 on the campaign group's biggest day of action to date. They were protesting against aggressive accounting measures that have allowed Starbucks to pay just \u00a38.6m in tax since launching in the UK 14 years ago.</p> <p>The action went ahead despite an <a href=\"http://starbucks.co.uk/blog/an-open-letter-from-kris-engskov/1249\" title=\"\">unprecedented promise</a> last week from Starbucks' UK boss, Kris Engskov, to overpay on the group's British tax bill by \u00a320m over the next two years. \"Our customers have been very vocal over the past six or seven weeks,\" he told Sky News. \"This is clearly an issue which has struck a chord with the country.\"</p> <p>A handful of stores, including two in London's busy West End shopping district, were briefly closed down around noon yesterday, and police threatened to arrest sit-in protesters for aggravated trespass. Organisers from UK Uncut had hoped to attract 1,000 protesters to Starbucks stores across the country.</p> <p>At a flagship store just off Regent Street's busy shopping parades, about 40 activists and six children had joined the action.</p> <p>The protest then moved to Vigo Street, another side road off Regent Street, where about 60 campaigners gathered among customers sipping lattes and herbal tea, chanting: \"If you don't pay your taxes, we'll shut you down.\"</p> <p>Zara Martin, 33, a protester who was handing out leaflets in the branch, said: \"Everyone is being really quite cheerful and the response from passersby is great, they are all smiley and interested in what we are doing. It's very encouraging.</p> <p>\"Even if people don't agree, it's important that we're having the debate. I think the \u00a320m over two years is a bit rubbish. It's like, wow thanks Starbucks, but actually why don't you just pay your full tax like everyone else has to?\"</p> <p>Customer Paula McCaully, 42, with her partner Ian, said: \"I was hoping for a coffee, but [the protesters] are right, of course, and we will boycott and get our coffee somewhere else, I think. Good for them, coming out on a cold day to stand up for what they believe in.\"</p> <p>The co-ordinated action against Starbucks was the latest in a string of protests which have thrown a spotlight on the complex and opaque world of tax treatments for multinational corporations. Others to be targeted have included Topshop and Vodafone.</p> <p>Acknowledging the level of public feeling, in his autumn statement last Wednesday George Osborne promised to make international reform of corporation tax \"an important priority\" when Britain takes the G8 presidency next year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the top tax expert at the OECD, the body responsible for overseeing the tax rules, conceded that abusive \u2014 but legal \u2014 behaviour among multinationals was a big, and worsening, problem. Pascal Saint-Amans told the <em>Observer </em>there is a \"large and growing gap\" between where firms carry out most of their activities and where they record their profits.</p> <p>\"Guess what? The location of the economic activities is in higher tax jurisdictions, but the location of the profits is in lower tax jurisdictions,\" he said.</p> <p>He said tackling the holes in the international tax system had become a growing priority, even among those countries \u2013 including the UK \u2013 that had previously been sceptical about reform.</p> <p>\"What's new is that this has been acknowledged, recognised, and it has become a political concern.\"</p> <p>The OECD's tax committee, which Saint-Amans chairs, is due to report to the G20 finance ministers in February with a set of proposals aimed at making the system fairer.</p> <p>Saint-Amans urges G20 countries to work together towards an agreed system of defining profits and where they are made, instead of battling each other over who gets what share. \"We are fighting to share a pie which is getting smaller and smaller, so let's work together to make sure the pie doesn't get smaller \u2013 and then we share it.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne's true colours had already become clear to the crowd of several tens of thousands who booed him with gusto at the Paralympics in September. But if there were any doubt that he is a true-blue Tory chancellor, it was blown away on Wednesday. The economics of the chancellor's autumn statement were, as expected, unremittingly grim \u2013 the Office for Budget Responsibility's latest forecasts, which have been yanked back into line with the consensus, show Britain well on the way to a lost decade, with the age of austerity now expected to go on until 2017-18. But if the economics were sobering, the politics were downright dismal. Osborne's \u00a33.7bn-a-year raid on the welfare budget \u2013 by uprating most benefits by just 1% a year for the next three years, instead of in line with inflation \u2013 may have been less drastic than the all-out freeze the Lib Dems claim credit for blocking. And a modest raid on top earners \u2013 through limiting tax-free pension contributions and dragging more people into the higher tax rate, worth a couple of billion between them \u2013 at least allowed the coalition to claim the highest-paid would contribute too. But it would be a mistake to underestimate the severity of the hit to the poorest. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the worst-hit group, just above the bottom of the income scale, would lose out by \u00a35.10 a week by 2015: more than 1.5% of their income. In other words, Osborne has surrendered any remaining claim he might have had to \"fairness\". He can't even be said to be \"balancing the books on the backs of the poor\": it's worse than that, since more than half of the cash raised from the benefits raid is not being banked, but instead handed to multinationals (corporation tax will fall by another 1p in 2014), and motorists. As an aside, the economics of welfare cuts is also questionable: people struggling to make ends meet tend to spend every penny they earn, so every pound taken out of their pockets is a pound of demand sucked out of local economies. But the second, and more serious, charge against the chancellor is that he has shattered one of the longstanding principles of the welfare state. Donald Hirsch, director of the centre for the study of social policy at Loughborough University, argues that the 1% cap is \"the most historic moment for the economic welfare of the poorest people in Britain for 30 years\". Since 1981, it has been accepted that benefits increase each year with prices, so that the living standards of the poorest are not eaten away by inflation. Osborne's stated rationale for breaking this tradition is that it would be unfair for welfare claimants to see their standard of living rise more rapidly than people in work: wages have been falling in real terms since the crisis began. But although the 1% rise is only planned to last for three years, that's a very, very long time in politics. Below-inflation increases will rapidly come to seem like the norm. Labour, or any other progressive party wanting to argue for a re-establishment of the link with prices, would probably have to expend a significant amount of political capital to restore the consensus. And the third criticism of Osborne's approach is that it was less about cutting Britain's coat according to its cloth, and more about a poisonous and cynical attempt to box Labour in. Ed Balls's flummoxed response to the statement was partly because he couldn't immediately see how the Treasury had pulled off the feat of making the deficit decline between last year and this. But it was also because, as a shrewd tactician himself, he was wary of falling into the political trap Osborne had set for him, of being seen to back \"scroungers\" against \"strivers\". The Resolution Foundation quickly pointed out that more than 60% of the impact of the below-inflation welfare rise will fall on people who are in work. So there are actually more strivers than scroungers in the chancellor's sights. Nevertheless, Balls is extremely fearful of being seen as a friend of that hazily sketched star of many of Osborne's speeches \u2013 the stay-in-bed layabout whose curtains are closed when his neighbours drag themselves off to work at the crack of dawn. Labour does appear to be edging towards rejecting the proposals when they are put to a vote \u2013 no doubt under intense pressure from its backbenchers; it seems unlikely that the party's rising stars went into politics to defend swingeing cuts in living standards for Britain's poorest families. But the frontbench are well aware that public polling suggests that so far at least, the voters support welfare cuts. And when Osborne puts some flesh on the bones of his latest austerity plans, in a spending review now planned for 2013, he will have a whole list of charges to chuck at Balls and his colleagues. Would they reverse the benefits cuts? Yes? Then what else would they cut instead, or what taxes would they raise to pay for it? But if Labour fails to stand up and be counted, we will face a general election campaign in 2015 that is the mirror-image of the pseudo-battle on tax and spending in 2005. Back then, Gordon Brown, who was still holed up in No 11, had ramped up health spending, and promised more increases to come. The Tories, conscious of the public's fondness for the NHS and wary of Labour jibes about sacking nurses, said they would stick like glue to Labour's spending plans \u2013 which they later derided as the height of fiscal irresponsibility. The entire debate was sterile, nitpicking and bore little relation to reality. So \u2013 quite apart from the abject failure of his economic and fiscal strategy and the whiff of fudge over the figures \u2013 Osborne's autumn statement was deeply unfair, nakedly cynical, and tugged at the fragile foundations of the modern welfare state. Compassionate conservatism has been exposed as a passing fancy almost as brief as David Cameron's infatuation with environmentalism.",
