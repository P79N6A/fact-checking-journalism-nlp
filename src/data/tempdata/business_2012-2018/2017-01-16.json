      "bodyText": "Hello again. Davos has been busy tonight with meetings, nobnobbing, some exclusive private dinner, and plenty of armed police to deter anyone from sneaking around where they shouldn\u2019t. But before that all started, WEF\u2019s founder, Klaus Schwab, told delegates that they need to up their game and deliver responsive and responsible leadership (the theme of this year\u2019s Forum). Schwab said: \u201cResponsive means that we listen to and interact with those who have entrusted us with leadership. It is always important to prioritize the public social good over our own interests. We must emphasize humanization over robotization.\u201d Schwab is hoping that this week\u2019s meeting will find ways to reform capitalism and boost growth, adding: \u201cSometimes it seems that the world is overwhelmed by pessimism and cynicism. But we have to look in a confident way into the future.\u201d Full marks for optimism, after a year that has demolished the Davos world view. We\u2019ll find out this week if WEF can rise to the challenge.... Goodnight! GW Elsewhere in Davos, PricewaterhouseCoopers has reported that many bosses are losing faith in globalisation (a journey that many people took a while ago). My colleague Larry Elliott explains: Executives running the world\u2019s leading companies share public scepticism about the benefits of globalisation and doubt whether breaking down barriers to trade has helped tackle climate change or inequality. The annual health check of global boardrooms conducted by the consultancy firm PwC found the mood more upbeat than a year ago, despite the shockwaves caused in 2016 by the vote for Brexit and the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election. But the survey, published to coincide with the World Economic Forum in Davos, found that the bullishness about the benefits of globalisation had diminished in the 19 years since PwC first polled executives at the end of the 1990s. Here\u2019s the full story: WEF\u2019s final Crystal Award goes to actor Forest Whitaker, for his work on conflict resolution in the developing world. The star of The Last King of Scotland explains that his Foundation helps young people to become the change they want to see in the world (hat-tip to Gandhi). These \u2018youth peacemakers\u2019 are working on the front line to achieve humanitarian breakthroughs. For example, in Uganda, former child soldiers are now setting up electronics shops and salons. In Mexico, they are leading skills-building sessions in prisons and tackling bullying in schools. And in one case (I missed the country, sorry), they even negotiated with an army occupying a school, persuading them to leave. Shakira, the Columbian performer and singer, also receives a Crystal Award from WEF for her humanitarian work. She talks about the crisis of child poverty in her country. Children who don\u2019t receive the food and stimulation they need, who aren\u2019t played with and read to, will never reach their full potential, she says. This means that being born into poverty means never getting out of it. In Columbia, there are 250 million children trapped in poverty -- that\u2019s almost the population of the United States. Today\u2019s babies will create tomorrow\u2019s businesses and solve tomorrow\u2019s problems; but those who are economically disadvantaged need more help to succeed and achieve their potential. Those with power, and money, cannot simply sit back and leave this to governments, she continues. Shakira says her Foundation has achieved \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d results by funding schools in the most remote parts of Columbia. Students responded academically \u2018so well\u2019, so that children who would have joined the guerillas are heading to university instead. Investment in education can create miracles -- it\u2019s a better feeling than winning a Grammy, she jokes. And she wants those at WEF to help provide more funding for ECD (early childhood development), and to \u2018invest in humans\u2019. \u201cIt\u2019s the smart thing to do, the strategic thing to do, and the just thing to do.\u201d Over in the WEF congress hall, violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter is receiving a crystal award from the Forum for her work helping young musicians. She says that music can play a role in making a better, more peaceful world as it has no ideology. Then she turns to the world\u2019s hunger crisis; 24 children have died through malnutrition in the last four minutes. Eight million people die from hunger each year; that\u2019s one every three seconds. She reminds the audience that the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals includes the total eradication of hunger by 2030. but not enough is being done. There\u2019s no shortage of talk, Mutter says pointedly, as: If one could eat resolutions and words, no-one would starve. Everyone in this audience can help, she concludes. You must ignore the sirens of ever greater wealth, and instead do more to protect the poor and the weak. Outgoing US vice-president Joe Biden is telling the World Economic Forum that he\u2019s optimistic that cancer can be beaten. On his final overseas trip as VP, Biden is updating Davos on the Cancer Moonshot - his effort to dramatically boost the fight against cancer. He says that the initiative has made real progress, by bolstering collaboration between research groups, doctor and drugs companies. Biden says there is an \u2018enormous\u2019 opportunity to build on this collaboration; he hopes that other countries will provide more support to help \u201cdouble-down\u201d on the battle. And Biden also hopes that his successor, Mike Pence, will continue this work. I\u2019ve already spoken to the vice-president elect who is a good man, about my willingness to continue to work with him and the incoming administration, to be as committed and enthusiastic as we are about the goal of ending cancer as we know it. My prayer is that they will do that as well. Whatever happens, Biden continues, those in the private sector, philanthropists, academics will continue to work together as there\u2019s just \u2018too much momentum\u2019, thanks to the improved collaboration between cancer centres, researchers, the government, etc. Biden insists that he\u2019s optimistic, thanks to the \u201cabsolute commitment and sheer brilliance\u201d of the researchers, scientists and institutions he\u2019s worked with. In time, more people will get the right cure first time, cancer prevention will be improved, and care will be personalised. \u201cThe one thing i can tell you, there\u2019s hope.\u201d Biden\u2019s son, Beau, died of brain cancer in 2015. And the VP ends his speech today by citing JFK\u2019s dream of putting a man on the moon: It was a moving speech, confirming that Biden\u2019s going to be missed. The Davos security people aren\u2019t taking any chances this year -- Bloomberg reports that they\u2019re carrying guns to shoot down any drones that approach WEF. Over in Davos, the 2017 World Economic Forum is now getting underway. The biggest global gathering of world leaders and business chiefs will be formally opened at 6.15pm Swiss time by Klaus Schwab, who founded WEF back in the 1970s. WEF will also award its traditional Crystal Awards, to violin Anne-Sophie Mutter, singer and performer Shakira and actor Forest Whitaker. That will tee up four days of meetings, speeches and behind-the scenes talk about issues like Donald Trump, Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, populism, climate change, artificial intelligence, and a lot more, under extra-tight security. Oxfam has the set the scene, with its warning that eight billionaires own as much net wealth as the poorest half of the country. And WEF itself is pushing for more inclusive, socially beneficial economic policies - having calculated that average incomes in many countries have shrank since 2008 (see earlier post). The pound has stabilised a little after its plunge to a three month low earlier in the day. But the fears of a hard Brexit, prompted by comments from the UK government ahead of prime minister Theresa May\u2019s speech on Tuesday, mean that sterling is still down around 1% against the dollar. It is currently down 0.8% at $1.2078 against the dollar and 0.6% against the euro at \u20ac1.1384. But despite the boost to overseas earners from the weak pound, the FTSE 100 has fallen back from its record intra-day level and is now down 0.11% at 7327. If the index closes lower it will end an unprecedented winning streak, with 12 successive days of record closes and fourteen days of rises. Financial shares are leading the fallers, hit by worries that a hard Brexit would cause problems for their ability to operate in Europe in the future. On that note, we\u2019ll close for the moment. But Graeme Wearden will be back later with the first reports from this year\u2019s Davos gathering. The UK Treasury has welcomed the upgrade to its forecasts by the IMF. It said: The fundamentals of the UK economy are strong, and today\u2019s IMF forecasts confirm their view that the UK was the fastest-growing major advanced economy last year. We have reduced the deficit by almost two thirds, cut taxes for millions of working people, and employment is at a near-record high. The Autumn Statement reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to return the public finances to balance as soon as practicable, while providing flexibility to support the economy as we exit the EU. Britain\u2019s business community has weighed into the Brexit debate ahead of an update by Theresa May on Tuesday: Britain risks a \u201cdisorderly crash landing\u201d if it assumes it can safely walk away from troublesome Brexit talks, business leaders have said, in a last-ditch plea for a negotiated settlement with Europe. As Theresa May prepares to reveal an uncompromising set of UK objectives on Tuesday, pressure is mounting on the prime minister to take a firm line with other member states and ultimately fall back on World Trade Organisation tariffs if no deal can be agreed. But the CBI is calling on politicians to wake up to the limitations of the WTO and dangers of a disorderly or \u201ctrain crash\u201d Brexit, despite the long and painful concessions that may be necessary if the UK is to obtain a replacement free-trade agreement when it leaves the single market. \u201cThe practicalities of a disorderly crash-landing need to be understood,\u201d said Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cWe have had conversations with some of the proponents of just walking away and we will again talk to them about what we see from our members about the consequences of that. \u201cAn exit into WTO at the stroke of midnight without the proper planning and preparation in place would be very serious for the UK economy. There are some signs that there is more conversation around that being an outcome. Our job is to demonstrate how difficult that would be because of all of these unanswered questions.\u201d The full story is here: Ahead of Davos the International Monetary Fund has issued a new warning on the global economy. Katie Allen writes: The global economy faces a multitude of risks in 2017, ranging from rising protectionism spearheaded by Donald Trump to a severe slowdown in China, the International Monetary Fund has warned. The Washington-based fund used an update to its economic forecasts to highlight popular antipathy towards international trade and a widening in the gap between rich and poor. It called on governments to tackle inequality by helping people find work in fast-changing jobs markets shaken up by technology and globalisation. The IMF made no changes to its October forecast for global economic growth to edge up this year after a sluggish 2016. But it upgraded its outlook for the UK economy, bringing the IMF more in line with other forecasters following signs that the British economy grew at a solid pace in the second half of 2016, despite the Brexit vote. The UK outlook for 2018 was cut, however. The full story is here: Now over to Greece. The prospect of further instability in the eurozone is mounting as consternation grows over the inability of Greece and its creditors to complete a second bailout review of the debt-stricken economy. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Fears are growing in Greece and abroad over continued friction between Athens and its creditors. Prolonged foot dragging over completion of a second bailout review has triggered mounting speculation that the debt-stricken country could be headed for new polls if it fails to come to some accord with lenders. The prospect of the IMF not participating in the current programme - mooted last week by Germany\u2019s powerful finance minister Wolfgang Schauble who suggested the European Stability Mechanism could assume the role instead \u2013 may have elicited thinly disguised euphoria in Greece but has been met with angst elsewhere. Schauble also hinted that departure of the IMF could mean even stricter terms for Greece \u2013 in short, a fourth bailout programme for a country now in its eighth year of austerity-induced depression. This morning the ESM\u2019s managing director Klaus Regling highlighted concerns saying whatever happened the German Bundestag would have to ratify the move. Berlin is the biggest contributor of the three rescue programmes that since 2011 have kept Greek bankruptcy at bay and had originally said it would only continue disbursing funds if the IMF was on board. If the review\u2019s conclusion is delayed for much longer officials worry Greece will miss the next target: of getting Greek bonds included in the European Central Banks QE programme in March. All off which has put Athens\u2019 leftist led administration under additional pressure to come up with alternatives to the \u201cillogical\u201d demands it says the IMF is now making \u2013 starting with the body\u2019s insistence that it legislate further multi-year pension cuts and income-tax hikes worth \u20ac4.5bn to ensure that primary surplus targets are met. Speculation of euro exit is once again gaining currency despite fiscal adjustment and the immense sacrifices the country has already made. Amid talk of the drachma returning, the government has signalled it is now working on new proposals for lenders which it will present at the next euro group of euro area finance ministers on January 26. The World Economic Forum has also found that incomes across many advanced countries shrank since 2008; another sign that economic policies need to change. WEF\u2019s new report on economic inclusivity (see last post) shows that median income shrank by almost 2.5% between 2008 and 2013 across the 26 advanced economies where data is available. And 51% of countries saw a decline in their inclusion score during the same period; driven by a surge in wealth inequality since the financial crisis. With public anger against the the political and economic establishment on the rise, WEF is urging politicians to do more to improve living standards, boosting quality of life and making people feel more secure. Richard Samans, a member of the Forum\u2019s Managing Board, argues: \u201cTo respond more effectively to social concerns, economic policy needs a new compass setting, broad-based progress in living standards, and a new mental map in which structural reform is reimagined and reapplied to this task, with chief economic advisers and finance ministers prioritizing it every bit as much their traditional focus on macroeconomic, financial supervisory and trade policy.\u201d We may hear more about this issue tonight, when Davos gets underway. Back in snowy Switzerland, a new report from the World Economic Forum makes rather dispiriting reading for the UK. Britain\u2019s wealth and gender inequality, generation gap and weak productivity growth mean it lags behind many rival advanced economies when it comes to economic inclusivity. That\u2019s according to WEF\u2019s \u201cInclusive Growth and Development Report 2017\u201d, which ranks Britain just 21th out of 30 fellow advanced economies. It\u2019s online here. The report, launched at Davos, looks at 12 performance measures that try to get deeper than simply measuring overall GDP. It found that the UK came 17th for \u2018growth and development\u2019, a section that covered GDP per person, labour productivity and life expectancy. The UK also came in the bottom half for \u2018inclusion;, which looked at how fairly income and wealth is distributed. WEF\u2019s Intergenerational equity index placed the UK in 23rd place, given the UK\u2019s high net debt (which must be paid off by future generations) and its dependency ratio (measuring the economic burden of pensioners and children on working people). Digging into the report shows that the UK scored well on other measures such as entrepreneurship (8th out of 30), the \u2018concentration of rents\u2019 (5th) and the tax code (where the UK was ranked top). But Britain was also ranked just 25 out of 30 on \u2018wage and non-wage compensation\u2019, dragged down by the gap in earnings between men and women, and the amount of pay swallowed up by childcare. Norway topped the charts, followed by Luxembourg, Sweden and Iceland. WEF\u2019s message is that politicians need to look beyond simple growth rates, and consider whether their economies are serving wider society. Otherwise, citizens are justified in turning to populist parties for answers. This recognition and the rebalancing of policy priorities it implies is what is required for governments to respond more effectively to decelerating growth and rising inequality \u2013 to take seriously the social frustrations increasingly being expressed through the ballot box and on the street. Such frustrations have an essential validity. The implicit income distribution system within many countries is in fact severely underperforming or relatively underdeveloped, but this is due to a lack of attention rather than an iron law of capitalism. The world economic recovery is still weak, according to China\u2019s president Xi Jinping. Speaking in the Swiss capital Bern before he heads off to Davos, he added that China would make its contribution to the recovery and his country\u2019s economy was peforming steadily overall. He said the country\u2019s GDP was expected to have grown by 6.7% in 2016, missing the 7% top end of the planned target range but still among the highest of major economies. More on the eurozone trade figures from IHS Markit chief economist Howard Archer: An improved traded good performance in November is supportive to belief that Eurozone GDP growth improved in the fourth quarter of 2016. While it is still questionable as to whether net trade contributed positively to fourth-quarter 2016 Eurozone GDP growth, November\u2019s improved trade performance at the very least dilutes the likelihood that net trade was an appreciable drag on activity. Net trade made a marginally negative contribution to Eurozone GDP growth in the third quarter, therefore being a factor limiting GDP growth to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter. In real terms, exports of goods and services edged up just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter while imports rose by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter. We believe that Eurozone GDP growth may well have improved to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2016 (from 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in both the third and second quarters). It\u2019s a thin day for data but there have been some eurozone trade figures, showing an increase in the trade surplus: The European banking sector is also losing ground after agency DBRS cut Italy\u2019s credit rating on Friday, a move which could raise borrowing costs for the country\u2019s financial businesses. UBS said: The downgrade will impact haircuts applied to Italian govies [government bonds] used as collateral by banks in monetary policy operations with the ECB. Haircuts are calculated based on the best available rating for an issuer and DBRS had the last A rating on Italy (S&amp;P: BBB-, Moody\u2019s: Baa2, Fitch: BBB+). As a consequence and depending on the maturity of the Italian govies pledged, we estimate the downgrade could lead to the need for a 6-9% top-up of the govies used as collateral. The comments from Theresa May over the weekend are nothing new, says Berenberg. Its senior UK economist Kallum Pickering said: While UK prime minister Theresa May has previously stated that she doesn\u2019t recognise the concept of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 the market clearly does. Comments by May hinting at a hard Brexit sent the pound lower over the weekend. But is any of it new information? No, not really. May has stated on several occasions that she will prioritise regaining control of the UK\u2019s borders and laws over access to the single market. In May\u2019s speech tomorrow we expect her to reiterate the same message, again. While the prime minister hasn\u2019t gone so far as to plainly state the potential impacts of such an arrangement, her broad aims for post-EU Britain have been consistently clear for some time now. The commonly heard \u2018uncertainty\u2019 about May\u2019s intentions is hard to justify. Unless May does a complete U-turn from here, any hope of full single market access for post-EU Britain is more or less out of the question. We can presume also, given that May has gone to the effort of setting up a trade department, currently headed by MP Liam Fox, and has stated on a number of occasions that the UK should be able to strike its own trade deals independently of the EU, that an exit from the EU customs union is likely too. We do not expect May\u2019s speech to alter our base case by much, if at all. We currently expect the UK and EU27 to agree a deal in which the UK maintains a good level of access to the EU\u2019s goods markets and limited access to the less developed services markets. Crucially, we expect the UK to lose its EU financial services passport. This follows from the UK raising some modest barriers to migration from the EU. Which is one reason why, as we mentioned earlier, financial shares are coming under renewed pressure, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays among the leading fallers. This in turn has seen the FTSE 100 come off its best levels, with the index currently around 4 points lower. Donald Trump\u2019s desire for a UK-US trade deal to be ready as soon as Britain leaves the EU came in an interview with Michael Gove, and is being covered by my colleague Andrew Sparrow in the politics live blog: Theresa May\u2019s speech on Brexit is not the only event which could influence the pound: The pound has come off its worst levels, but is still down more than 1% at $1.2041. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: After falling below the key 1.20 level on Sunday, [the pound] has since staged a comeback.... The was partly driven by comments from Donald Trump in an interview with The Times newspaper where he said that the UK was at the top of a list for a trade deal with the US, and that the UK did a great thing by leaving the EU. Other factors that have soothed the pound this morning include some reassurances from the UK Treasury that it will address investors concerns that may arise from Theresa May\u2019s speech on Tuesday. This \u201crecovery\u201d is also typical after a move below a key technical level such as 1.20 in the pound/dollar, and thus may only be temporary. Looking ahead, we think that the pound is likely to remain vulnerable, and, in the short term, the market could once again test the air below 1.20, and the lows from October\u2019s flash crash. Volatility levels in the pound/dollar as measured by the options market, have risen once again on Monday, taking the 1-month GBP/USD volatility level to a fresh 4-month high. This suggests that investors are expecting further large moves from the pound in the short term. Some have wondered why the foreign exchange market continues to be \u201cshocked\u201d by news about a hard Brexit, after all the UK\u2019s exit from the single market has always been on the cards and is not a new concept. I would argue that the \u2018Brexit theme as bad news for the pound\u2019 is such an ingrained trend at this stage that it really doesn\u2019t matter what May says or fails to say on Tuesday. Instead, it\u2019s all about market dynamics, and right now the balance of market participants are shorting the pound. It\u2019s a bit like a tipping point, once a trend gets critical mass, like the pound downtrend, then news headlines can have big impacts, as they generate another wave of selling. Ahead of the Davos gathering, the World Economic Forum warned on the risk of rising inequality, and here is more evidence. Larry Elliott writes: The world\u2019s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe\u2019s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth. In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was \u201cbeyond grotesque\u201d that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (\u00a3350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people. The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives. The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation. Larry\u2019s full report is here: With little in the way of economic or corporate news, and the US markets shut for Martin Luther King day, the fall in the pound is likely to dominate investor sentiment. No surprise given the influence of the weak pound on its overseas constituents, but the FTSE 100 has reached a new peak in early trading. The leading index is up 0.2% to an intra-day high of 7354, despite a fall in banking shares after Goldman Sachs cut its recommendation on Royal Bank of Scotland from buy to neutral. The financial sector is also being undermined by worries about the repercussions of a hard Brexit on the City. Mining shares are dominating the risers, accounting for seven of the top ten best performers. Sterling could fall as low as $1.10 according to Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: Cable is now clinging to the $1.20 handle for dear life and seems to have steadied a little as trading commences in London \u2013 pound trading in Asia is often quite volatile because of thin liquidity. We\u2019ve also got the pound trading at its weakest level against the euro since November. It\u2019s looking more and more like a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit is in the offing and markets are responding. The currency market is the most efficient and swiftest to price it in. However the full effects of a hard Brexit are not yet completely discounted by the markets and so we could have further to run depending on what is said tomorrow. We now have to assume May will prioritise immigration controls and the price to pay will be to exit the single market. That could send the pound a lot lower still, perhaps towards $1.10 in the coming weeks. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on the triggering of Article 50 is another risk factor that is likely to increase volatility in pound crosses. May probably won\u2019t give everything away and explain the government bargaining position in detail, but it looks like she will sound more hawkish and steer the tone towards a hard Brexit. The PM\u2019s statements have a habit of hitting sterling pretty hard and today\u2019s moves are clear signs of nervousness in the fx market. The PM could, however, strike a more soothing tone than markets expect and that could spark a significant short-term reversal in cable, although long-term it\u2019s going to be hard to shake the bears. Here\u2019s the pound\u2019s continuing decline: The pressure on the pound is only likely to get worse, with volatility increasing, according to economists at UniCredit: [We] believe that sterling is a sell on any potential rallies. Even in the event of a more \u201cconciliatory\u201d tone (by Mrs. May hinting at seeking out a transitional agreement with the European Union, for instance) the respite on sterling is very likely to be only temporary. As long as control over immigration remains the UK government\u2019s anchoring point, it is virtually impossible to envision anything other than an exit from the EU\u2019s single market. With the pound weaker, the FTSE 100 is indeed expected to hit new heights: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The pound has come under renewed pressure ahead of a key speech by UK prime minister Theresa May on Tuesday, where she is expected to spell out Britain\u2019s negotiating strategy for Brexit talks. Investors fear that she will indicate the UK will leave the single market and the customs union, and a so-called hard Brexit will be on the cards. That has combined to send the pound down to its lowest levels since the flash crash of October last year. It fell as low as $1.1983 in Asian trading before recovering some ground. It is currently down 1.45% at $1.2002, while against the euro it has fallen 1.24% to \u20ac1.1312. The strength of the dollar is also hitting the pound, with investors still anxious to hear details of president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans to boost the US economy. But with the weak pound one of the driving forces behind the rise of the FTSE 100 to record levels, since it boosts the business of overseas earners, markets are expected to open higher. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The weakness of the pound has been one of the key catalysts as to why the FTSE100 has managed to push strongly above its previous all-time highs, as well managing to break record after record in closing higher every day since just before Christmas. This pattern looks set to continue again, with a higher open for the UK benchmark, as we head into a new week after the pound fell below the 1.2000 level for the first time since the flash crash lows in October last year in Asia overnight. It would appear that the main catalyst behind this sell-off is speculation that UK Prime Minister Theresa May will set out tomorrow the UK government\u2019s position when it comes to coming to deal with the EU with respect to its negotiation position ahead of the expected triggering of article 50 in March, though this could still be derailed by the Supreme Court ruling which is due any day now. The expectation is that the Prime Minister\u2019s insistence on being able to better control immigration as well as the UK\u2019s law making, will result in the UK announcing its intention to leave the single market and customs union, which most investors appear to assign as being exceedingly negative for the pound. Elsewhere it is a fairly quiet day on the corporate and economic front, but later the annual jamboree in Davos begins, with full coverage in the blog by my colleague Graeme Wearden.",

While it is still questionable as to whether net trade contributed positively to fourth-quarter 2016 Eurozone GDP growth, November\u2019s improved trade performance at the very least dilutes the likelihood that net trade was an appreciable drag on activity. Net trade made a marginally negative contribution to Eurozone GDP growth in the third quarter, therefore being a factor limiting GDP growth to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter.

Its senior UK economist Kallum Pickering said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While UK prime minister Theresa May has previously stated that she doesn\u2019t recognise the concept of a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 the market clearly does. Comments by May hinting at a hard Brexit sent the pound lower over the weekend. But is any of it new information? No, not really. May has stated on several occasions that she will prioritise regaining control of the UK\u2019s borders and laws over access to the single market. In May\u2019s speech tomorrow we expect her to reiterate the same message, again.</p> <p>While the prime minister hasn\u2019t gone so far as to plainly state the potential impacts of such an arrangement, her broad aims for post-EU Britain have been consistently clear for some time now. The commonly heard \u2018uncertainty\u2019 about May\u2019s intentions is hard to justify. Unless May does a complete U-turn from here, any hope of full single market access for post-EU Britain is more or less out of the question. We can presume also, given that May has gone to the effort of setting up a trade department, currently headed by MP Liam Fox, and has stated on a number of occasions that the UK should be able to strike its own trade deals independently of the EU, that an exit from the EU customs union is likely too.</p> <p>We do not expect May\u2019s speech to alter our base case by much, if at all. We currently expect the UK and EU27 to agree a deal in which the UK maintains a good level of access to the EU\u2019s goods markets and limited access to the less developed services markets. Crucially, we expect the UK to lose its EU financial services passport. This follows from the UK raising some modest barriers to migration from the EU. </p> </blockquote> <p>Which is one reason why, as we mentioned earlier, financial shares are coming under renewed pressure, with Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays among the leading fallers.

Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After falling below the key 1.20 level on Sunday, [the pound] has since staged a comeback.... The was partly driven by comments from Donald Trump in an interview with The Times newspaper where he said that the UK was at the top of a list for a trade deal with the US, and that the UK did a great thing by leaving the EU.</p> <p>Other factors that have soothed the pound this morning include some reassurances from the UK Treasury that it will address investors concerns that may arise from Theresa May\u2019s speech on Tuesday. This \u201crecovery\u201d is also typical after a move below a key technical level such as 1.20 in the pound/dollar, and thus may only be temporary.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Looking ahead, we think that the pound is likely to remain vulnerable, and, in the short term, the market could once again test the air below 1.20, and the lows from October\u2019s flash crash. Volatility levels in the pound/dollar as measured by the options market, have risen once again on Monday, taking the 1-month GBP/USD volatility level to a fresh 4-month high. This suggests that investors are expecting further large moves from the pound in the short term.</p> <p>Some have wondered why the foreign exchange market continues to be \u201cshocked\u201d by news about a hard Brexit, after all the UK\u2019s exit from the single market has always been on the cards and is not a new concept. I would argue that the \u2018Brexit theme as bad news for the pound\u2019 is such an ingrained trend at this stage that it really doesn\u2019t matter what May says or fails to say on Tuesday. Instead, it\u2019s all about market dynamics, and right now the balance of market participants are shorting the pound. It\u2019s a bit like a tipping point, once a trend gets critical mass, like the pound downtrend, then news headlines can have big impacts, as they generate another wave of selling.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-587c7bd6e4b0f10ba20b8b8a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-01-16T08:34:20.273Z\">8.34am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ahead of the Davos gathering, the World Economic Forum warned on the risk of rising inequality, and here is more evidence.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The weakness of the pound has been one of the key catalysts as to why the FTSE100 has managed to push strongly above its previous all-time highs, as well managing to break record after record in closing higher every day since just before Christmas.</p> <p>This pattern looks set to continue again, with a higher open for the UK benchmark, as we head into a new week after the pound fell below the 1.2000 level for the first time since the flash crash lows in October last year in Asia overnight.</p> <p>It would appear that the main catalyst behind this sell-off is speculation that UK Prime Minister Theresa May will set out tomorrow the UK government\u2019s position when it comes to coming to deal with the EU with respect to its negotiation position ahead of the expected triggering of article 50 in March, though this could still be derailed by the Supreme Court ruling which is due any day now.</p> <p>The expectation is that the Prime Minister\u2019s insistence on being able to better control immigration as well as the UK\u2019s law making, will result in the UK announcing its intention to leave the single market and customs union, which most investors appear to assign as being exceedingly negative for the pound.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere it is a fairly quiet day on the corporate and economic front, but later the annual jamboree in Davos begins, with full coverage in the blog by my colleague Graeme Wearden.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce, Britain\u2019s leading multinational manufacturer, is to pay \u00a3671m in penalties after long-running investigations into claims it paid bribes to land export contracts. The settlement means the engineering giant will avoid being prosecuted by anti-corruption investigators in the UK, US and Brazil, though individual executives may still be charged. It comes five years after investigators across three continents first began examining claims that the \u00a313bn multinational had paid bribes to secure contracts in countries around the world. Last year a joint Guardian and BBC Panorama investigation identified 12 countries in which Rolls-Royce had hired \u201ccommercial agents\u201d or advisers to help it secure high-value contracts. Anti-corruption campaigners said the deal showed the British government was not serious about tackling bribery, despite years of rhetoric promising to make the UK a hostile environment for the corrupt. Susan Hawley, the policy director of Corruption Watch, described the settlement as \u201cproof the UK is not willing to prosecute a large, politically connected company\u201d. Robert Barrington, the executive director of Transparency International, said \u201cthere must be a prosecution of individuals\u201d in addition to the settlement. In deals announced on Monday, Rolls-Royce said it would pay \u00a3497m to the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), subject to approval by the high court. It will also pay $169m (\u00a3140m) in penalties to the US Department of Justice and $25m to the Brazilian authorities. The terms of the agreement with the SFO are to be examined on Tuesday by Sir Brian Leveson QC, the president of the Queen\u2019s bench division of the high court. Under the proposed deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), Rolls-Royce will pay the penalties over five years, along with a payment covering the SFO\u2019s costs. Rolls-Royce announced that it reached separate deals with the US Department of Justice and Brazilian prosecutors. It added: \u201cThese agreements relate to bribery and corruption involving intermediaries in a number of overseas markets, concerns about which the company passed to the SFO from 2012 onwards. \u201cThese are voluntary agreements which result in the suspension of a prosecution provided that the company fulfils certain requirements, including the payment of a financial penalty.\u201d The anti-bribery investigations have been embarrassing for the multinational, which sells turbines and engines for passenger jets and military aircraft across the globe. David Cameron once praised it as \u201ca world leader in the development of advanced technologies \u2026 of which the whole country can be proud\u201d. The Duke of Cambridge called it \u201cone of the United Kingdom\u2019s great global companies\u201d. The firm has had close relations with British governments of all political hues, while ministers have often lobbied foreign governments to give large export contracts to the manufacturer. Without admitting any wrongdoing, Rolls-Royce has repeatedly attempted to signal its willingness to reform after the bribery allegations emerged. In 2013 the company hired the prominent City lawyer Lord Gold to conduct a review of its anti-corruption and compliance procedures. The following year the company used its annual report to reveal that it had substantially reduced its use of third parties to help it secure contracts. The company\u2019s chief executive said last year that winning contracts legitimately was key to future growth. Warren East, who took the helm in 2015, said in an interview with the Guardian that the bribery scandal was \u201cnot a very desirable situation\u201d. Hawley said: \u201cThe extent and egregious nature of the allegations against Rolls-Royce \u2013 and the fact that all indications are that it didn\u2019t actually self-report, but this came from a whistleblower \u2013 really raise questions about whether this is being done as a convenient form for Rolls-Royce to carry on getting public contracts.\u201d Companies are supposed to refer themselves to investigators in order to qualify for a deferred prosecution agreement. If convicted of corruption offences, a company can be barred from bidding for public contracts unless it were able to prove it had reformed. A relatively recent development in British law, a DPA is an arrangement under which a company can halt investigations against it for a fine. If further wrongdoing were to be committed during the duration of the agreement, the original prosecution could be reactivated. Barrington said: \u201cThe fine is an eye-catching size, much bigger than any previous deferred prosecution agreement. Transparency International has always that the DPA must only be used when it is in the public interest, so information needs to be put into the public domain about this investigation. \u201cThe critical part is that there must be a prosecution of individuals. There is criminality here, and we would like to see the SFO set out a timeline for those prosecutions.\u201d He said he was encouraged to see Brazilian, US and British regulators working together. \u201cIt will send a shiver down the spine of bribe-payers,\u201d he said. Sources close to the negotiations said the SFO and Rolls-Royce attended a preliminary court hearing on Monday, with a statement being issued as the markets closed. It is understood that the Brazilian authorities have allowed Rolls-Royce to sign a leniency agreement, which is similar to a DPA. The SFO has had at least 30 investigators in the UK focused on the multinational\u2019s use of agents or middlemen to clinch export contracts in a number of countries across several strands of its business. Rolls-Royce\u2019s sprawling organisation has customers in more than 150 countries, including more than 400 airlines and leasing customers. The Guardian and BBC\u2019s Panorama reported that agents have been hired in Angola, Azerbaijan, Brazil, India, China, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 January 2016.

In part, that was because the inquiry was taking ages \u2013 it started in 2012 \u2013 and could be considered a problem for another day. It was also because the potential financial impact was almost impossible to assess from outside since both sides volunteered few details of the accusations. Investors know better now. The deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the SFO, plus separate agreements with authorities in the US and Brazil, is big, ugly and serious. Rolls will pay a total of \u00a3671m, which is roughly equivalent to its entire expected profits for 2016. But cash and profit, as Rolls shareholders have learned painfully, are not the same thing. Even before yesterday, Rolls was predicted to suffer a cash outflow for 2016 as it ramps up production of new classes of engine. For 2017, the City expected only break-even at a cash level. This penalty for bribery and corruption in foreign markets \u2013 details to be revealed in court on Tuesday \u2013 has landed at a bad moment. The US and Brazil authorities want their cash quickly but the good news for Rolls, relatively speaking, is that the SFO is prepared to wait. A five-year payment schedule has been agreed, which would take the company into years when it hopes to be generating cash again at a rate of \u00a31bn. In that regard the SFO has been lenient, perhaps with half an eye on preventing collateral damage to employees and suppliers. The damage to Rolls\u2019 reputation is harder to quantify. If you\u2019re an optimist, it\u2019s possible to take comfort that Rolls has substantially reduced the number of sales agents and intermediaries it uses around the world. But a \u00a3671m financial penalty is a damning scar on a company that used to be regarded as the UK\u2019s finest manufacturer. As for the SFO, it must tell us why it chose not to pursue a criminal investigation against the company. DPAs have their use in complex cases \u2013 and Rolls may fit that description \u2013 but they are not meant to become a default tactic. After the court hearing, the SFO must explain its thinking. Imperial should spark up a pay row Alison Cooper has been paid roughly \u00a318m over the course of her six full years as chief executive of Imperial Brands, the cancer-stick company known as Imperial Tobacco until its diversionary change of name. Call it an average of \u00a33m a year, or \u00a31m every four months. Not bad, especially as the trend has been firmly upwards. Last year she got \u00a35.5m. Cooper would also appear to have a strong incentive to remain loyal to her employer of 17 years. She owns shares in Imperial worth \u00a36.5m, accumulated in most part through the incentive-based components of her pay package. She also has unvested share awards worth \u00a312m at current prices and, on recent form, could expect to scoop about two-thirds of that pot. Is she loyal, though? David Haines, Imperial\u2019s chairman, seems to doubt it. He worries that pay for Imperial executives is \u201csignificantly below the average for companies of our size\u201d and thinks this creates \u201can unnecessary risk with regard to retaining our senior team\u201d. He proposes cranking up the maximum Cooper and others can receive in a given year. Three years ago this was \u00a35.8m in Cooper\u2019s case and has been increased annually. Haines now wants her to chase \u00a38.5m. But, note, a bigger prize doesn\u2019t imply meaningfully stiffer targets. \u201cWe would not wish to disguise the fact that our proposals allow us to pay more for the delivery of the levels of performance seen in recent years,\u201d Haines concedes. There you have it: a pay increase to keep up with the Joneses, or other FTSE 30 companies. Imperial has performed well for investors (though not as strongly as BAT, the other big London-listed gasper merchant). But has Cooper threatened to quit? Has any executive? And why does Haines think Imperial employs nobody capable of filling her or other executives\u2019 shoes? Answers to these questions would be more useful than Haines\u2019 pious bleat about how he is \u201csympathetic\u201d \u2013 just not in Imperial\u2019s case \u2013 to concerns about pay increases which do not reflect performance. City fund managers, even once-shy BlackRock, tell us they want to clamp down on \u201cbenchmarking\u201d awards for bosses already earning many millions. Imperial\u2019s plan would seem to be a classic example of the ratchet factor at work. If its proposal passes next month, you\u2019ll know the fund managers don\u2019t really mean what they say.",

Another year of falling full-time work would be disastrous, both for their government and more importantly, for workers. It must be said that 2016 was a pretty awful year for jobs. The final figures are out this week, but last year is on track to be the second worst year for employment growth in the past 20 years: In the 12 months to November last year, employment grew by a mere 0.7% \u2013 less than half the 20 year annual average growth of 1.8%. Last year also looks like being the just the fourth year in the past 20 to see full-time employment go backwards. Little wonder that during last year\u2019s election, those in the government were much more eager to talk about the employment growth of 2015 \u2013 as that was the best year since 2010. The sharp drop in employment growth last year can be seen by how difficult it has become for the LNP to achieve Tony Abbott\u2019s promise from the 2013 election of one million jobs in five years. Initially that would have required employment to grow by 1.75% each year, the strong jobs growth in 2015 saw the annual growth rate (think run rate from the cricket) hit 2.6%, well above the \u201crequired\u201d growth rate. However to get to one million new jobs by September 2018, the required employment growth rate is 2.3% \u2013 well above the current rate of 0.7%: The other big problem is that only 30% of the 495,900 jobs created since September 2013 have been full-time. In September 2013, 69.6% of all employment was full-time, now it is 68% \u2013 equivalent to 191,000 fewer full-time jobs And yet the news is not all bad. Last week the latest job vacancy figures released by the ABS showed the 13th consecutive quarter of increasing vacancies \u2013 an equal record long run: The growth of vacancies is slightly better in the public sector than the private, and both have come off the recent peaks of early 2016: That said, the job vacancy rate and the number of unemployed per vacancy are better now than they have been at any time since 2012: In trend terms there were just 3.9 unemployed per vacancy \u2013 well down on the 5.2 reached at the end of 2014. Partly this is due to the falling participation rate \u2013 down from 65.1% at the end of 2015 to now 64.5%. The fight for jobs becomes a bit easier when some people give up looking for work. Had the participation rate in November 2016 been the same as in November 2015, there would have been 4.6 unemployed on average for each vacancy - meaning the fight for jobs would actually have gotten worse. As ever, how good things are depends on where you live, and what job you are after. In NSW there are on average just 3 unemployed per vacancy, and Victoria is second best with 4.2 unemployed fighting for each job. Tasmania and South Australia are the toughest places to get a job, while with 5.3 unemployed per vacancy, it\u2019s now harder to find a job in WA than at any point since the GFC: The strongest job growth has come in the education industry and the \u201cother services\u201d sector (which includes jobs like automotive and machinery repair, and personal services such as hairdressing). The weakest growth of job vacancies is in art and recreation, mining, transports and warehousing and construction: Thus the picture remains quite uneven for job hunters, but in a political environment where the Turnbull government is suffering from a lack of popularity, and where this year\u2019s budget is likely to be a tough one should Scott Morrison deem that keeping a AAA credit rating is imperative, the government will be desperately hoping 2017 is not a repeat of 2016. And while the job vacancy figures suggest a solid if not bounding levels of job creation, the department of employment\u2019s leading indicator of employment index does provide some cause to think 2017 will be better than was last year. Since November 2014, the department\u2019s leading indicator index has barely been registering a positive rating \u2013 suggesting a weakening employment market. But the signs have been getting better. In December, the indicator, which takes into account a variety of economic indicators \u2013 including the Chinese manufacturing managers purchasing index \u2013 was just -0.03. That is the best result since September 2015: Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison, as well as anyone looking for work, will be hoping that follows through to stronger job growth over the next 12 months. History would suggest it couldn\u2019t be worse than it was last year, but, as ever, the real question will be whether there is a return to strong full-time job growth. Without that, both the prime minister and treasurer will struggle to convince voters of the worth of any economic future they promise.",

      "bodyText": "Executives running the world\u2019s leading companies share public scepticism about the benefits of globalisation and doubt whether breaking down barriers to trade has helped tackle climate change or inequality. The annual health check of global boardrooms conducted by the consultancy firm PwC found the mood more upbeat than a year ago, despite the shockwaves caused in 2016 by the vote for Brexit and the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election. But the survey, published to coincide with the World Economic Forum in Davos, found that the bullishness about the benefits of globalisation had diminished in the 19 years since PwC first polled executives at the end of the 1990s. Business leaders said they remained positive about the economic benefits of free movement of goods, people and capital but questioned whether globalisation had done anything to narrow the gap between rich and poor or to stop global warming. Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House later this week has also raised concerns about protectionism. Almost three fifths of those questioned said they were worried about trade barriers going up, rising to 64% in the US and Mexico. Bob Moritz, PwC\u2019s global chairman, said: \u201cDespite a tumultuous 2016, CEO confidence is moving back up \u2013 albeit slowly and still a long way from the levels we saw back in 2007. But there are signs of optimism right across the globe, including in the UK and US, where, despite predictions of a Trump slump and a Brexit exit, CEOs\u2019 confidence in their company\u2019s growth are up from 2016.\u201d Fears that global companies would shun Britain after the shock EU referendum result were not supported by the PwC survey, which showed more chief executives pinpointing the UK for investment than a year ago. The survey fund that 89% of UK chief executives said they were confident about their own company\u2019s growth prospects in the year ahead, up from 85% a year ago. Confidence about the prospect for revenue was highest in India, followed by Brazil, Australia and the UK. The findings reflect the better than expected performance of the economy since the EU referendum last June and will be welcomed by Theresa May before her speech on Tuesday outlining the government\u2019s aims in the Brexit negotiations. A year ago, confidence across the globe was dented by plunging commodity prices, falling stock prices and concerns about a slowdown in China. The 2017 survey found that 38% of chief executives were very confident about the outlook for their companies against 35% in 2016 and 29% said they expected the global economy to grow more strongly over the next 12 months, up from 27%. The poll of almost 1,400 executives from 79 countries was conducted between September and December last year. Moritz said the findings showed that business leaders were aware of the disquiet that led to the political shocks of 2016. \u201cPublic discontent has the potential to erode trust which is needed for long term sustainable performance. The real challenge here, though, isn\u2019t just one of how CEOs navigate, it\u2019s about the need for CEOs to have a deeper, two-way relationship with stakeholders, customers, employees, and the public,\u201d Moritz said. \u201cUnderstanding the root cause of the potential discontent or perception is a critical first step towards communicating the benefits of business for society. There\u2019s a lot at stake if we do not achieve inclusive global growth.\u201d",

Unveiling its new forecasts on the eve of a key speech by Theresa May on the Brexit process, the Washington-based fund also cut the outlook for 2018, reflecting widespread uncertainty over Britain\u2019s future outside the EU. The IMF forecast that the UK will grow by 1.5% this year, up from a previous estimate of 1.1%. However, 2018 expectations were revised down from 1.7% to 1.4%.

It listed that uncertainty among a host of risks it sees to the global outlook that also included the potential for a wave of protectionism as Donald Trump takes over the US presidency. The IMF was forced to accept in October that its prediction of a post-Brexit-vote financial crash had proved to be overly pessimistic. Monday\u2019s upgrade brought it more in line with other forecasters after signs the UK economy grew at a solid pace in the second half of 2016. The IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, Maurice Obstfeld, included the unknown nature of Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU in a list of factors contributing to a climate of uncertainty that also included elections in the eurozone, the change of president in the US and geopolitical tensions. The IMF used an update to its economic forecasts to highlight popular antipathy towards international trade and a widening in the gap between rich and poor. It called on governments to tackle inequality by helping people find work in fast-changing jobs markets shaken up by technology and globalisation. The IMF made no changes to its October forecast for global economic growth to edge up this year after a sluggish 2016. But it upgraded its outlook for the US on the assumption that more spending under Trump would boost growth. However, it said there was uncertainty around the nature of economic policy under the new administration and how it would impact other economies. Obstfeld noted signs of widespread frustration around the world at what many feel is an unfair distribution of the fruits of globalisation and economic growth. As policymakers and business leaders gather in Davos for the World Economic Forum, and with inequality top of this year\u2019s agenda, the IMF became the latest in a line of international bodies to call for more shared prosperity. \u201cSocial dislocation due to globalisation and, even more, to technology change is a major challenge that will only intensify in the future. One result has been wider inequality and wage stagnation in many countries,\u201d Obstfeld said, presenting the latest IMF forecasts. He added that a key takeaway from 2016 was that \u201csustainable growth must also be inclusive growth\u201d. But at the same time, with nationalist politicians gaining ground in some countries, the IMF warned against moving towards more inward-looking policies. Without naming Trump, who campaigned on an anti-globalisation platform and with the promise of a big infrastructure drive, the IMF said there was a risk that higher spending could force the US central bank to raise interest rates at a faster pace to contain inflation and that would push up the US dollar. Those currency moves, which would make US exports more expensive and its imports cheaper, risked driving up \u201cprotectionist measures and retaliatory responses\u201d, Obstfeld said. On the other hand, the extra spending in the US was likely to bolster economic growth, and if done in a way that did not stoke inflation it would allow the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a more moderate pace. The IMF sees the US economy growing by 2.3% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018. That was an upgrade from October\u2019s forecasts for 2.2% for 2017 and 2.1% for 2018. For the global economy, the IMF saw more scope for growth to disappoint rather than beat expectations. It forecast 3.4% growth this year and 3.6% in 2017. That follows estimated growth of 3.1% in 2016. \u201cA faster pace of expansion would be especially welcome this year: global growth in 2016 was the weakest since 2008-09, owing to a challenging first half marked initially by turmoil in world financial markets,\u201d said Obstfeld, referring to sharp swings on markets this time last year. To help shore up growth in 2017, the IMF called on central banks to keep policy \u201caccommodative, relying on unconventional strategies as needed\u201d. It also repeated a call for governments to do their share of the heavy lifting with spending and long-term reforms to make growth more sustainable.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s Ayrshire golf course is expecting its most profitable year thanks to the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote and an increase in hotel guests at the resort. Over the weekend, Trump said business at Turnberry, which he bought for \u00a334m in 2014, was doing \u201cunbelievably\u201d thanks to Brexit because \u201cyour pound sterling has gone down\u201d. \u201cBusiness is unbelievable in a lot of parts [of] the UK, as you know,\u201d he said in an interview with leave campaigner and former Conservative leadership contender Michael Gove. \u201cI think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing.\u201d The US president-elect\u2019s assessment of Turnberry was backed by the century-old golf resort\u2019s general manager. \u201cFrom the business we have on the books so far, the pace is telling me the Trump Turnberry will have its best year of revenue in 100 years,\u201d Ralph Porciani told the Guardian on Monday. Porciani, who has run Turnberry for nearly 14 years, said he was expecting revenue this year to be 15% to 20% higher than the \u00a316.2m it collected in 2007 \u2013 the club\u2019s best year so far. Trump has invested \u00a3140m in returning the resort on the west coast of Scotland to its glory days. Porciani said business had increased despite about half of the hotel being closed for a refurbishment programme overseen by Trump\u2019s middle son, Eric. \u201cI would be over the moon if we could meet our best year, when 50% of the business is under renovation, but I think we can beat 2007 by 15% to 20%,\u201d he said. When Trump officially reopened the resort the day after the EU referendum in June, he said: \u201cIf the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry. I think it could very well turn out to be a positive.\u201d The pound fell by 1% on Monday to $1.2065 at 1pm, after touching $1.1986 earlier in the day \u2013 the weakest it has been since October 2016. Sterling was trading at $1.4840 before the Brexit vote. Porciani said the fall in sterling had made the resort a much more appealing destination for US holidaymakers, despite rounds at its Ailsa course costing up to \u00a3350 for non-residents of its hotels. \u201cWhen it comes to customers from the USA, the pound\u2019s [fall] against the dollar is much better for Americans and they are spending much more in the pro shop. There has been a 20% uplift,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boys in the Trump Turnberry shop are saying customers are excited that they can get \u2018great Turnberry sweaters for a discount\u2019.\u201d Porciani said his boss\u2019s statement is likely to be reflected in the resort\u2019s financial accounts, and the club will turn a profit in 2017 after years of losses. The company lost \u00a31.37m in 2015, according to the latest accounts filed at Companies House. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a profit this year \u2013 it will be the first time we have made a good profit in the 14 years I have worked here,\u201d Porciani said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t make anywhere near the kind of profit we will make over the next five years.\u201d Porciani declined to comment on Trump\u2019s president election victory, and said he had zero-tolerance policy when it came to staff discussing politics with guests. He said he expected Trump to be too busy to visit the club as much as he has in the past, but said he had been an inspiration to work with every time he has visited. \u201cHe points us all in the right direction, he works 20-hour plus days and leaves us all physically and mentally drained when he leaves but he is a real inspiration,\u201d Porciani said. The club has come under fire recently from some members for raising fees by 38% to \u00a32,500. Porciani said fees had been increased to reflect the huge investment Trump has made in the Ailsa Open Championship course and improvements to the resort\u2019s secondary Kintyre course. One member told the Daily Record that fees had become a \u201creally thorny issue\u201d and complained about a lack of consultation between Trump Turnberry managers and players. \u201cWe accept there have been massive improvements to the course and enjoy what Donald has achieved here,\u201d the member said. \u201cBut you\u2019d think the next president of the United States could give us some help back in the old country.\u201d The member said it appeared that Trump would rather have tee times available for \u201cwealthier golfers and business types on day trips\u201d than local members who might only want to pop into the clubhouse for \u201ctea and a bacon roll\u201d. Porciani said he had not heard from any members complaining about Trump\u2019s lack of interest in local golfers. He said the \u00a3700 increase might seem expensive but he added that fees had been frozen for the last three to four years and the new fees were still less than at Gleneagles, which charges \u00a32,830.",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest asset manager is threatening to unleash a fresh wave of shareholder rebellions in the UK unless Britain\u2019s largest companies rein in excessive boardroom pay. BlackRock is demanding cuts to director pension entitlements and an end to huge pay rises as UK companies prepare to put their latest pay deals to shareholders. In a letter to the bosses of more than 300 UK companies, the US fund manager said it would only approve salary rises for top executives if firms increase workers\u2019 wages by a similar amount. It is a significant intervention from a company which is a shareholder in every business listed on the FTSE 100 index. BlackRock has $5.1tn (\u00a34.2tn) of investments and describes itself as the world\u2019s largest fund manager. The company\u2019s head of investment stewardship in Europe, Amra Balic, said in the letter that a failure to meet the standards outlined by the fund manager would call into question the quality of the board. She said pay must be linked to performance. \u201cExecutive pay should be strongly linked to performance, by which we mean strong and sustainable returns over the long-term, as opposed to short-term hikes in share prices,\u201d she said. \u201cWe consider misalignment of pay with performance as an indication of insufficient board oversight, which calls into question the quality of the board. We believe that shareholders should hold directors to a high standard in this regard.\u201d About half of Britain\u2019s biggest quoted companies face binding shareholder votes on their pay plans in 2017. One of the issues highlighted by BlackRock is the gap between the pay rises handed out to the most senior executives, and those awarded to the rest of the workforce. The fund manager said: \u201cIn case of a significant pay increase year-on-year that is out of line with the rest of the workforce, BlackRock expects the company to provide a strong supporting rationale. Large increases should not be justified principally by benchmarking.\u201d The letter to bosses, first reported in the Sunday Times, echoes investor rebellions from 2016. Last April, almost 60% of shareholders voted against a \u00a314m pay package for the chief executive of BP in a year in which it reported record losses, cut thousands of jobs and froze its employees\u2019 pay. Also, more than 50% of investors voted against pay deals at the medical equipment group Smith &amp; Nephew, as shareholders demonstrated their unwillingness to tolerate boardroom excess. Excessive boardroom pay has moved up the national agenda since the financial crisis of 2008 and prime minister Theresa May stated an ambition to crackdown on poor corporate governance in the UK. Last week BlackRock became the largest shareholder in Lloyds Banking Group after the government further reduced its stake in the bailed-out bank. Stefan Stern, director at the High Pay Centre, welcomed the intervention from BlackRock but said more needed to be done to tackle excessive boardroom pay. \u201cThere is a systemic problem in top pay. The system is failing and one of the issues is the big asset managers not being effective in helping to restrain those big packages. As a rule, they have not stepped up, so BlackRock are absolutely right to engage in this way.\u201d Stern said the government, as well as the wider public, also had a bigger role to play in calling for change. Blackrock said that annual shareholder votes, where the results are not binding, should not be used to justify pay increases. \u201cPay should only be increased each year, if at all, at the same level of the wider employee base, and in line with inflation,\u201d the company said. One of the first companies to put their pay proposals up for the shareholder vote will be Imperial Brands at its annual general meeting on 1 February. David Haines, chairman of the the tobacco company\u2019s remuneration committee, is recommending a hike in the pay package of its chief executive Alison Cooper, from \u00a35.5m in the last financial year to a maximum of \u00a38.5m in the current financial year. A spokesman for the company said the proposed hike in pay reflected the committee\u2019s concerns about the company\u2019s ability to \u201cretain and attract executive talent\u201d, adding that Cooper had achieved shareholder returns of more than 170% since she took the top job six years ago.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK economy performed surprisingly well in 2016. Indeed, when looking across the OECD economies, it is hard to find a better performer on key metrics such as growth and employment. However, when looking beneath the surface, the UK economy is, in fact, overheating. Already on the rise, the result is going to be the largest surge in inflation for many years, squeezing household budgets and placing the Bank of England in a bind largely of its own making. Already weak prior to the surprising Brexit referendum result, sterling declined sharply thereafter and has not recovered since. Year over year the pound is down about 20% against both the dollar and the euro. Combined with the sharp 70% rise in oil prices over the same time frame, UK energy and food costs are set to soar this year. These developments alone will push up UK consumer price index by 1 to 2 percentage points. That may not seem so much, especially when CPI is currently only 1.2% year-over-year. But there is an even more troubling trend: following years of low wage growth, unit labour costs began to rise sharply last year. This is due in part to rising wages but also to persistently weak productivity growth. Labour compensation is the single largest contributor to inflation. Thus while some workers will no doubt enjoy pay rises over the coming year, when combined with the food and energy effects it is unlikely that most will keep up with the rising cost of living. In 2016 the Bank of England found itself persistently on the defensive, including over government claims that its aggressive monetary policies, such as quantitative easing, have exacerbated inequality. While there is evidence to that effect, a sharp rise in the cost of living will only serve to reinforce this perception. The wealthy have ample means to protect their wealth from being eroded by inflation. The middle class and pensioners have little, if any. Anyone living on a salary is in particular trouble unless they receive a commensurate pay rise. And therein lies the greatest potential problem: workers who sense that they are falling behind are going to demand higher wages. Those in government or in industries such as healthcare and transport, in which competition is limited, are likely to see strikes as an increasingly attractive wage negotiation strategy. Although the public is rightly annoyed by the huge inconveniences that strikes can cause, if they take place alongside a palpable rise in the cost of living then striking workers may find some public compassion. The government may thus find that it has less political leverage to de-escalate and settle strikes on its preferred terms. In this context, the Bank of England will eventually need to bite the bullet and begin increasing interest rates if it is to keep CPI anywhere near the 2% target. Combined with soaring energy prices, this will place the brakes on growth. While a recession may not be in store in 2017, slower growth almost certainly is. If this unpleasant, \u201cstagflationary\u201d mix of sharply rising prices yet slowing growth sounds a bit like what occurred in the 1970s, that\u2019s because it is. The fact is the UK has been living on borrowed time and borrowed money ever since the financial crisis struck in 2008. Sterling devalued sharply back then as the Bank slashed rates to zero and began QE. These \u201cemergency\u201d measures, now in place for over eight years, have kept the economy on life support by subsidising a huge expansion of debt, public and private, and the associated property bubble. They have not created the necessary conditions for a truly self-sustaining economic recovery. Indeed, the opposite could be argued, that by keeping the monetary spigot open for so long the Bank has encouraged debt-fuelled speculation rather than a salutary economic de-leveraging. As the Bank finally moves to raise rates in response to sharply higher inflation, bond yields are likely to rise and share prices may well decline or, at a minimum, fail to keep pace with the cost of living. The much-maligned British saver, suffering for years from artificially low interest rates, is only going to find things getting worse as portfolio valuations decline. Borrowers, meanwhile, will find they are tapped out. They call economics the \u201cdismal science\u201d for good reason. There is no free lunch. With inflation finally on the rise, the QE piper will now need to be paid. \u2022 John Butler is vice president of Goldmoney Wealth",

    "webTitle": "Private health insurance sales surge amid NHS crisis", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The number of people in Britain taking out private medical insurance has risen significantly for the first time since 2008, amid fears about the ongoing crisis gripping the NHS. After falling steeply between 2008 and 2011 and then staying flat, demand for private medical insurance cover in Britain rose by 2.1% in 2015 with just over 4 million people insured. The figures, compiled by healthcare consultancy LaingBuisson, account for the period until the end of 2015. Figures for 2016 are not yet available. Philip Blackburn, an economist at LaingBuisson, said: \u201cThere has been a clear rise in interest in private healthcare recently as more and more people are dissatisfied with higher waiting on the NHS and increased restrictions on NHS treatment. Private medical cover will benefit from this, and there is a wide choice of policy options at different prices to attract customers.\u201d The rise in sales of private medical insurance (PMI) comes despite increases in insurance premium tax (IPT) during the period from 6% to 9.5%, which has made policies more expensive. But the private medical industry is still far below its peak in 2008, when 4.35 million people \u2013 12.4% of the UK population \u2013 had private cover. After the rise in 2015, a total of 4,022,000 people have cover, or 10.6% of the population. All of the rise in private cover is coming through company schemes, where the number of employees with medical insurance rose by 3.4% to 3,070,000 people, or 76.3% of the total. This suggests that the increased popularity of PMI may be down to a recovery in the economy and companies taking more staff, rather than fears about the state of the NHS. The number of individual subscribers to private medical insurance continued to decline, dropping by 1.7% to 952,000. Most are put off by the rising cost of buying cover independently. A typical PMI policy for a healthy 35-year-old costs about \u00a3650 a year, but this rises steeply to \u00a32,300 for those aged 70, when claims are far more likely. But the LaingBuisson data suggests that the companies and private hospitals selling cover are enjoying bumper profit margins. Companies and individuals spent \u00a34.7bn on private medical insurance in 2015, but the total value of claims was \u00a33.6bn, leaving the providers with a gross profit of \u00a31.1bn. LaingBuisson estimated that the total gross profit margin for PMI providers rose from 25.9% in 2014 to 26.7% in 2015. But it added that further tax rises and Brexit may make 2017 a tough year for the industry. \u201cA sharp increase in IPT from 6% to 9.5% effective from November 2015, and further rise to 10% from November 2016 has loaded significant additional cost for all medical insurance customers. A further hike to 12% in June 2017 will tighten this \u2018taxation straitjacket\u2019, and in an industry where affordability has been identified as the primary reason for a lack of growth in demand, this hefty additional burden is likely to mean demand for PMI is vulnerable going forward,\u201d said Blackburn, adding that \u201cthe medical cover sector faces further uncertainty from the UK\u2019s impending exit from the European Union.\u201d",

Figures for 2016 are not yet available. </p> <p>Philip Blackburn, an economist at LaingBuisson, said: \u201cThere has been a clear rise in interest in private healthcare recently as more and more people are dissatisfied with higher waiting on the NHS and increased restrictions on NHS treatment.

This suggests that the increased popularity of PMI may be down to a recovery in the economy and companies taking more staff, rather than fears about the state of the NHS. </p> <p>The number of individual subscribers to private medical insurance continued to decline, dropping by 1.7% to 952,000. </p> <p>Most are put off by the rising cost of buying cover independently.

But it added that further tax rises and Brexit may make 2017 a tough year for the industry.</p> <p>\u201cA sharp increase in IPT from 6% to 9.5% effective from November 2015, and further rise to 10% from November 2016 has loaded significant additional cost for all medical insurance customers. A further hike to 12% in June 2017 will tighten this \u2018taxation straitjacket\u2019, and in an industry where affordability has been identified as the primary reason for a lack of growth in demand, this hefty additional burden is likely to mean demand for PMI is vulnerable going forward,\u201d said Blackburn, adding that \u201cthe medical cover sector faces further uncertainty from the UK\u2019s impending exit from the European Union.\u201d</p>",

Official figures due to be published on Tuesday are expected to show that fuel, food, air fares and clothing prices have driven the headline rate to 1.4% in December, from 1.2% in November. If economists polled by Reuters are correct, the rate would be the highest since August 2014, when the consumer prices index was 1.5%. \u201cInflation is expected to have been lifted in December by higher fuel prices as well as sterling\u2019s weakness increasingly feeding through to cause retailers, services companies and manufacturers to lift their prices,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at research company IHS Markit. The Bank of England has warned life will be tougher for consumers in 2017, with inflation expected to rise close to 3%, squeezing family budgets against a backdrop of slowing economic growth. Meanwhile, National Debtline said the number of people seeking advice on how to cope with debts was up sharply compared with a year earlier. Calls to the free advice service were up 17% in the first eight working days of 2017 compared with the same period last year, while the number of people seeking advice online jumped by 55%. Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, said households should scrutinise their finances as inflation rises. She said: \u201cAs the first credit card bills of 2017 begin to arrive through letterboxes this week, many people will be worrying about how to cope. We are seeing a big leap in the number of people coming to us for help \u2013 and yet we know that many more will be struggling with financial problems on their own. \u201cWith the UK economy entering a period of significant uncertainty and inflation beginning to creep up, it is important that households use the start of the year to take stock of their personal finances \u2013 and take action to deal with any debts now.\u201d Some of Britain\u2019s biggest retailers have warned prices could rise in 2017 as they are forced to pass on higher costs to customers. A weaker pound makes the cost of goods imported from abroad more expensive. Next has warned clothing prices could rise by about 5% in the coming months. Figures published last week by Kantar Worldpanel showed that over the Christmas period supermarket prices rose for the first time in more than two years, underlining expectations that household budgets will come under increased pressure in 2017. Kantar said inflation returned with a 0.2% increase in like-for-like grocery prices for the 12-week period ending on 1 January compared with a year earlier. These are not the official inflation figures, but are based on 75,000 products Kantar compares year-on-year in the proportions purchased by shoppers.",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s eight richest billionaires control the same wealth between them as the poorest half of the globe\u2019s population, according to a charity warning of an ever-increasing and dangerous concentration of wealth. In a report published to coincide with the start of the week-long World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Oxfam said it was \u201cbeyond grotesque\u201d that a handful of rich men headed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates are worth $426bn (\u00a3350bn), equivalent to the wealth of 3.6 billion people. The development charity called for a new economic model to reverse an inequality trend that it said helped to explain Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. Oxfam blamed rising inequality on aggressive wage restraint, tax dodging and the squeezing of producers by companies, adding that businesses were too focused on delivering ever-higher returns to wealthy owners and top executives. The World Economic Forum (WEF) said last week that rising inequality and social polarisation posed two of the biggest risks to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation. Oxfam said the world\u2019s poorest 50% owned the same in assets as the $426bn owned by a group headed by Gates, Amancio Ortega, the founder of the Spanish fashion chain Zara, and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. The others are Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa: the Mexican telecoms tycoon and owner of conglomerate Grupo Carso; Jeff Bezos: the founder of Amazon; Mark Zuckerberg: the founder of Facebook; Larry Ellison, chief executive of US tech firm Oracle; and Michael Bloomberg; a former mayor of New York and founder and owner of the Bloomberg news and financial information service. Last year, Oxfam said the world\u2019s 62 richest billionaires were as wealthy as half the world\u2019s population. However, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor. With members of the forum due to arrive on Monday in Switzerland, where guests will range from the Chinese president Xi Jinping, to pop star Shakira, the WEF released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations. Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Denmark filled the top five places in the WEF\u2019s inclusive development index, with Britain 21st and the US 23rd. The body that organises the Davos event said rising inequality was not an \u201ciron law of capitalism\u201d, but a matter of making the right policy choices. The WEF report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, \u201cattesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress\u201d. Basing its research on the Forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank Credit Suisse, Oxfam said the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world\u2019s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries. It was four years since the WEF had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, Oxfam added. \u201cFrom Brexit to the success of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,\u201d the report said. The charity said new information had shown that poor people in China and India owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that 62 billionaires owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population. Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before. It is beyond grotesque that a group of men who could easily fit in a single golf buggy own more than the poorest half of humanity. \u201cWhile one in nine people on the planet will go to bed hungry tonight, a small handful of billionaires have so much wealth they would need several lifetimes to spend it. The fact that a super-rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become.\u201d Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: \u201cOnce again Oxfam have come out with a report that demonises capitalism, conveniently skimming over the fact that free markets have helped over 100 million people rise out of poverty in the last year alone.\u201d The Oxfam report added that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. It said that over the next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1tn to their heirs \u2013 a sum larger than the annual GDP of India, a country with 1.3 billion people. Between 1988 and 2011 the incomes of the poorest 10% increased by just $65, while the incomes of the richest 1% grew by $11,800 \u2013 182 times as much. Oxfam called for fundamental change to ensure that economies worked for everyone, not just \u201ca privileged few\u201d.",

However, the number has dropped to eight in 2017 because new information shows that poverty in China and India is worse than previously thought, making the bottom 50% even worse off and widening the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>With members of the forum due to arrive on Monday in Switzerland, where guests will range from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/11/china-xi-jinping-world-economic-forum-davos-donald-trump\">Chinese president Xi Jinping</a>, to pop star Shakira, the WEF released its own inclusive growth and development report in which it said median income had fallen by an average of 2.4% between 2008 and 2013 across 26 advanced nations.</p> <p>Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland and Denmark filled the top five places in the WEF\u2019s inclusive development index, with Britain 21st and the US 23rd. The body that organises the Davos event said rising inequality was not an \u201ciron law of capitalism\u201d, but a matter of making the right policy choices.</p> <p>The WEF report found that 51% of the 103 countries for which data was available saw their inclusive development index scores decline over the past five years, \u201cattesting to the legitimacy of public concern and the challenge facing policymakers regarding the difficulty of translating economic growth into broad social progress\u201d.</p> <p>Basing its research on the Forbes rich list and data provided by investment bank Credit Suisse, Oxfam said </p> <p>the vast majority of people in the bottom half of the world\u2019s population were facing a daily struggle to survive, with 70% of them living in low-income countries. <strong><br></strong></p> <p>It was four years since the WEF had first identified inequality as a threat to social stability, but that the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen, Oxfam added.<br></p> <p>\u201cFrom Brexit to the success of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, a worrying rise in racism and the widespread disillusionment with mainstream politics, there are increasing signs that more and more people in rich countries are no longer willing to tolerate the status quo,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The charity said new information had shown that poor people in China and India owned even fewer assets than previously thought, making the wealth gap more pronounced than it thought a year ago, when it announced that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/richest-62-billionaires-wealthy-half-world-population-combined\">62 billionaires </a>owned the same wealth as the poorest half of the global population.</p> <p>Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThis year\u2019s snapshot of inequality is clearer, more accurate and more shocking than ever before. It is beyond grotesque that a group of men who could easily fit in a single golf buggy own more than the poorest half of humanity. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/16/eight-people-earn-more-billion-economics-broken\">Eight people earn more than 3.6 billion: our economics is broken | Mark Goldring</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhile one in nine people on the planet will go to bed hungry tonight, a small handful of billionaires have so much wealth they would need several lifetimes to spend it. The fact that a super-rich elite are able to prosper at the expense of the rest of us at home and overseas shows how warped our economy has become.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Littlewood, director general at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: \u201cOnce again Oxfam have come out with a report that demonises capitalism, conveniently skimming over the fact that free markets have helped over 100 million people rise out of poverty in the last year alone.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Oxfam report added that since 2015 the richest 1% has owned more wealth than the rest of the planet. It said that over the next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1tn to their heirs \u2013 a sum larger than the annual GDP of India, a country with 1.3 billion people. Between 1988 and 2011 the incomes of the poorest 10% increased by just $65, while the incomes of the richest 1% grew by $11,800 \u2013 182 times as much.</p> <p>Oxfam called for fundamental change to ensure that economies worked for everyone, not just \u201ca privileged few\u201d. <br></p>",
