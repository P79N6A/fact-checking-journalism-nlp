      "bodyText": "As we gear up for Christmas spending, things should be pointing to a bumper lot of sales and yet despite excellent employment news our level of spending and consumer confidence remains below where it was last year. With wages growth remaining weak and much of the jobs growth geared towards lower paying work, maybe what is needed is a jolt of optimism \u2013 and just maybe this could come from this week\u2019s overwhelming victory for marriage equality. It has to be said that the employment news is overwhelmingly good. Employment has now been growing in trend terms every month since December 2013, and according to the more erratic seasonally adjusted measure, it has been growing for 13 straight months \u2013 the best consecutive run since 1994. Right now nearly 77% of all 25 to 64 year olds are working \u2013 the highest level ever recorded, largely off the back of a record number of women in the workforce. And best of all, the jobs have been full-time. In the past 12 months hours worked has risen by 3.1% \u2013 the best result since December 2010 \u2013 and full-time employment has grown by 3.6% \u2013 the strongest growth since June 2007. It is undeniably good news. You can quibble all you like about what is classed as employment, but having 289,000 more people working full-time than a year ago is hard to spin as a negative. And yet despite a nice recent rise, the latest ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence measure remains at a point actually lower than it was this time last year. And last year, it should be recalled, was a terrible year for employment \u2013 it was one of the few calendar years where full-time employment fell. The level of growth of our retail spending is also lower than it was this time last year. Every year around this time we start getting stories about Christmas sales and stores gearing up for a booming December. Most often they are just retail industry spin \u2013 trying to get us believing that going out and shopping is being done in big numbers so we shouldn\u2019t feel bad about doing it ourselves \u2013 indeed we should be doing it! But this year such stories should be true. After all the unemployment rate of 5.4% is the lowest it has been since January 2013. And while, somewhat oddly, employment growth and retail spending growth don\u2019t line up all that well, it is a bit odd that in light of the good employment news, overall we are spending less in the shops than when the job situation was worse a year ago. One reason might be that in the past 12 months most of the jobs have come from industries that are generally lower paying. Over the last year two thirds of the increase in net employment has come in industries that have lower average earnings than the national average. This is an issue the Reserve Bank highlighted in its latest statement of monetary policy when it noted that \u201cemployment growth remains strongest in the household services sector, particularly in health care and social assistance\u201d. It also noted this could mean average earnings are lower than otherwise would be expected because there is \u201cmore growth in lower-income jobs\u201d. What is worse is the Reserve Bank has also noted that new employment within industries is geared towards lower paying jobs. It noted anecdotal reports that suggest \u201can increase in the proportion of new employees hired on lower salaries than their predecessors\u201d. So yes, we are seeing a solid increase in employment, but this is not resulting in a rise in overall average incomes like we would expect and as a result we are not seeing a similar boost in spending or consumer confidence. And when you throw in to the mix the fact that wages growth across the board is down it makes for a disconnect between the unemployment rate and our desire to spend. But perhaps there is some hope. Often when talking of the need to encourage investment, economists talk of \u201canimal spirits\u201d \u2013 essentially the need for people to be willing to take a risk and invest because they believe things are going to get better. In a speech this week, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, Guy Debelle listed this as the most powerful reason why non-mining investment has been weak. A similar case might apply to consumer spending. One problem with consumer confidence is that it is generally linked with the performance of the government. If people think the government is doing well they are more inclined to think the economy is performing well and also that they are confident things will either stay good or keep improving. This is why ALP and Liberal voters often swap their levels of confidence from positive to negative after a change of government. With the government mired in bad polls, this is unlikely to change, but perhaps the overwhelming yes vote result in the marriage equality survey might produce some sense of optimism that things are not so bad. Of course should the conservatives forces conspire to bog the process down, any optimism would probably dissipate, but were it all to go through quickly, perhaps people might gain some sense that life is not so bad. And while it is unlikely to provide a significant increase in total spending, at the very least there should be a bit of a boost from shopping for some long-waited-for weddings in January.",

      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer has been usurped by online rival Asos in what has been described as the high street\u2019s \u201cTesla moment\u201d as old retailing stalwarts get overtaken by new online rivals. The 17-year-old fashion website has been biting at M&amp;S\u2019s heels for several months but on Friday its shares gained 2%, boosting its market value to \u00a34.89bn, making it a more valuable business than the 133-year-old high street giant, now worth \u00a34.88bn, according to Reuters data revealing the number of shares in issue. Earlier this year, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mark Photiades predicted Asos would leapfrog M&amp;S as the website, aimed at fashion hungry twentysomethings, grows in stature just as traditional store groups struggle to grow. Earlier this month, M&amp;S\u2019s new chairman, Archie Norman, accused the struggling store chain of \u201cdrifting\u201d for more than 15 years: \u201cThis business has been drifting, underfulfilling its customer promise not for five years, not 10 years but 15 years and maybe beyond.\u201d The shift in retail power is being compared with the automotive industry, where the electric carmaker Tesla sped ahead of the 114-year-old Ford Motor Company in April to become the US\u2019s most valuable car manufacturer. Similarly, the online retailer Amazon is now worth nearly twice as much as Walmart, after overtaking the American grocery chain in 2015. Photiades said that 20 years ago, when online shopping was in its infancy and before Asos was established, M&amp;S had a market value of \u00a316.9bn. When Asos floated on the stock market in October 2001, it was valued at \u00a314m, compared with \u00a37.8bn for M&amp;S. The market valuation of a company reflects expected future earnings: M&amp;S remains bigger both in sales and in terms of profit. Asos recorded sales of \u00a31.9bn last year, compared with \u00a310.6bn at M&amp;S. Profits were \u00a380m and \u00a3176.4m, respectively. Profits have been going backwards for several years at M&amp;S despite its position as the UK\u2019s biggest clothing retailer. It was making full-year profits of more than \u00a31bn in 2008 but that figure has been whittled down by a long running slump in clothing sales. Since taking over a year ago the M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe, has stabilised the performance of its clothing arm and shut loss-making stores overseas. Unlike Asos, Rowe also has to grapple with the challenging economics of its large store portfolio as sales migrate online and fewer shoppers frequent the high street. Asos brags that it puts around 5,000 new items on its site each week \u2013 the equivalent of an entire Oxford Street shop \u2013 and is constantly adding new features to the site such as visual search, which allows customers to upload photos from social media to search for a similar outfit. Rowe says M&amp;S\u2019s \u201cdestiny\u201d also lies online, setting a target ofone-third of sales online by 2022. But he warned M&amp;S will need to plough investment into its infrastructure to reach it. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Polluting coal power stations in Britain have been profiting from the woes of the low-carbon French nuclear industry this month, according to analysis of energy generation data for the Guardian. Tricastin, one of France\u2019s biggest nuclear power stations, was closed by the French regulator in September so that works could be undertaken to address a flood risk. The plant\u2019s reactors make up four of 19 currently offline in the French nuclear power industry, which experienced even worse outages last winter due to regulatory safety checks. The operators of Britain\u2019s eight remaining coal power stations appear to have stepped in to exploit higher French prices, exporting power across the channel as temperatures have plunged. UK coal power generation has declined rapidly in recent years under the carbon tax. Most of the time, France sends electricity to the UK through 43-mile-long cables between Folkestone and a site near Calais, but in November there have been more hours when power has flowed in the other direction. On Friday, power through the interconnector was almost entirely flowing at maximum capacity towards France. \u201cWe are now exporting to France through the interconnector which is unusual. Normally we are a net importer from France but yet again towards the end of the year we are exporting,\u201d said Andrew Crossland, who runs MyGridGB, a site that monitors power generation data. \u201cEssentially this means that France is importing higher carbon electricity than it can produce at home,\u201d he added. Data compiled by Crossland shows coal power has continued to decline in the UK this year after dramatically falling two-thirds in 2016. There have been 583 coal-free hours in 2017 to date \u2013 compared with 210 last year \u2013 with coal providing just 6.7% of electricity supply so far. Analysis by Iain Staffell, lecturer in sustainable energy at Imperial College and author of the Electric Insights report, came to a similar conclusion. \u201cIn short, coal usage has shot up in the last two weeks, both because we are now exporting to France and because demand is growing as it gets colder. We are still using less coal than we did this time last year though,\u201d he said. Uniper, the German energy company that runs Ratcliffe coal power station in Nottinghamshire, said the higher usage was a response to the situation in France and colder temperatures. \u201cOver the past few weeks, the French power market has seen relatively higher power prices compared to Britain. One of the impacts of this is that flows on the Britain-France interconnector have seen more of a flow to France than to Britain,\u201d the company said in a statement. British coal power station owners may also be responding to one of Britain\u2019s biggest nuclear reactors, Sizewell B, being offline for servicing until mid-December. The UK has pledged to phase out the country\u2019s remaining coal power stations by 2025. This week it led the launch of an alliance of 19 nations, including New Zealand and Mexico, committed to quitting coal as quickly as possible. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 November to correct the number of French reactors offline.",
