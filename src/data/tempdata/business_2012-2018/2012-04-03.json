      "bodyText": "Spain has set off further alarm bells among bond investors and its crisis-hit eurozone neighbours by conceding that its debts will balloon this year to their highest level for two decades. The admission fanned fears that the recession-bound country will lose its battle to stay on top of its debts without reaching for outside bailout funds and knocked Spanish government bond prices. Despite announcing its most austere budget for more than 30 years last week, Spain's government admitted on Tuesday that the debt-to-GDP ratio will jump to 79.8% in 2012 from 68.5% last year. Ministers put the rising ratio, which will still be below the European average, down to high interest payments, Spain's contribution to the Greek bailout and the cost of support for its own banks and regional authorities. Nerves around Spain's creditworthiness \u2013 whose economy is twice the size of that of Greece, Ireland and Portugal combined \u2013 had settled somewhat since the depths of the eurozone debt crisis last year. But recent days have brought renewed fears in financial markets and among fellow eurozone members that Spain could be the biggest threat to their future. The latest downbeat news from the government sent shares falling and bond yields climbing. Spain's main IBEX share index ended 2.7% lower while the spread between Spanish bonds and their German equivalents widened as investor confidence slipped. The market moves undid much of the brief gains made last week in the wake of a budget from Mariano Rajoy's conservative government announcing \u20ac27bn (\u00a322.5bn) in spending cuts and tax rises. Economists and many Spaniards, a million of whom took to the streets in a general strike last week, fear the tough budget will accelerate the country's renewed slide into recession. The economy is already under pressure from tumbling house prices, a troubled banking system and the highest youth unemployment in the eurozone. Economists at Citigroup predict Spain will end up being pushed into \"some form of a Troika programme\" this year, meaning terms set by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union. Such a move would probably be a condition of further ECB support for Spanish banks, which are currently the main buyers of newly issued Spanish sovereign debt, they say. Still, they draw a contrast with other peripheral eurozone economies. \"Even if Spain enters a programme, we expect that it would likely continue to fund itself at least partly in the market, unlike Greece, Ireland and Portugal,\" say Citi's Ebrahim Rahbari and Guillaume Menuet. Nor do they see the country's sovereign debt problems reaching the same crisis levels as in Greece. \"We continue to believe that sovereign debt restructuring in Spain is unlikely.

      "bodyText": "Chris Rogers, Whitbread's experienced finance director, is to take over direct control of the group's strong-performing Costa Coffee business in a boardroom reshuffle that appears to prepare the espresso chain for a sale or flotation. Once a sprawling leisure empire rapidly constructed on the foundations of Whitbread's brewing legacy in the 1990s, the group has been dramatically slimmed down and now comprises just three divisions \u2013 Premier Inn, Costa Coffee and a pub restaurants arm including Beefeater and Brewers Fayre. While the pubs, restaurants and budget hotels are paired alongside each other, making for a well-integrated business, the same is not true for Costa. The coffee business, for the last six years run by John Derkach, operates as a very separate business unit and there has been speculation for some time that it would be spun off. The chief executive, Andy Harrison, said: \"There is no hidden agenda here. The announcement was driven by John's decision to join Tragus [the private equity-backed firm behind Strada, Cafe Rouge and Bella Italia]. And the decision to appoint Chris is because he is the best man for the job.\" Asked about the possibility of demerging Costa, Harrison said: \"Whitbread is a great owner of Costa and the business continues to perform well for shareholders.\" But he added: \"The future is a long time and we have always said: 'Never say never'.\" Operating in a rare growth market on the high street, Costa is one of Britain's few chains in expansion mode. The business has 1,375 UK stores, 920 Costa Express vending machines and a further 800 shops overseas. Whitbread's previous chief executive, Alan Parker, who stepped down in late 2010, had steadily dismantled much of the leisure empire, a conglomerate of the type that had fallen out of fashion with City investors. Among the businesses that were sold were the UK franchise operations of Marriott Hotels, Pizza Hut and TGI Friday's. Gone too are David Lloyd Leisure, most of Whitbread's pubs and the group's share in Pepsi bottling group Britvic. Derkach will leave in August to join Tragus, the restaurant group backed by private equity house Blackstone. He will replace long-standing chief executive Graham Turner and arrives following a refinancing last month of the group's debts. Blackstone agreed to convert some of its loans to Tragus into equity to relieve pressure on the firm's balance sheet. Net debt at the firm, which runs almost 300 restaurants, was reduced from \u00a3240m to \u00a3219m as a result. Geof Colyer, an analyst at Deutsche bank, Whitbread's house broker, played down the likelihood of a Costa demerger. \"If demerger was a near-term option why is the managing director leaving? We see an early demerger of Costa as potentially limited the realisable value from the Costa growth plans for investors.\" However, he added that the implied value of Costa in Whitbread's share price was too low. \"We estimate that the implied value is barely five times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.\"",

      "bodyText": "The hunt to find the least disruptive way to organise a breakup of the troubled euro entered its final phase on Tuesday when a shortlist of five was announced for the \u00a3250,000 Wolfson prize. Prompted by the sovereign debt crisis that has gripped the single currency for the past two-and-a-half years, more than 400 entries were received for the award, sponsored by the multimillionaire chief executive of the Next fashion chain and Tory peer Lord Simon Wolfson. It is the second most lucrative prize for economics after the annual Nobel prize. The winner of the Wolfson will be announced in July but the chairman of the judges, Derek Scott, said that all five contenders had provided valuable ideas about how a country could exit the euro, which was created at the end of the 1990s and is now used by 17 European Union states. Those on the shortlist \u2013 a team from Capital Economics led by Roger Bootle; private investor Cathy Dobbs; Jens Nordvig and Nick Firoozye, of Nomura Securities; Neil Record, of Record Currency Management; and Jonathan Tepper, from Variant Perception \u2013 are assured a \u00a310,000 share of the prize and have until the end of May to develop their argument. Wolfson said he had been \"fantastically impressed by the entries\", and said the idea was to provide \"an answer to a problem which at some point Europe is going to have to face\". He added that a breakup would involve the devaluation of a large number of currencies, which in turn would prompt fears of large-scale default. \"That threat raises issues of capital flight and how you control capital flows.\" The shortlisted entrants said at a London press conference that they remained unconvinced that recent attempts to shore up the single currency would work in anything other than the short term. These have included a second bailout for Greece, the most heavily indebted eurozone member, an increase from \u20ac500bn (\u00a3420bn) to \u20ac800bn in the size of the war chest to stave off speculative attacks, and steps by the European Central Bank to flood eurozone banks with ultra-cheap money. \"Greece will leave within the not too distant future\", Bootle said, adding that he hoped the ideas prompted by the prize would help to minimise the disruption of departure. He said that a breakup would not only help the weaker members of the single currency, but also help Germany to rebalance its economy away from exports and towards strong domestic demand. Tepper said he thought there would be an attempt to muddle along, but eventually those \"countries that see an economic benefit to exit will do so. Economic pressures will force countries to exit.\" Scott, a former economic adviser to Tony Blair, described the single currency as \"a doomsday machine that is not only undermining economies but undermining democracy\". He added: \"The question of currency breakup is clearly enormously complex, spanning financial and legal arrangements. We were impressed by a number of the entrants' efforts to grapple with these issues. We felt it was only fair to give finalists the opportunity to refine their thoughts.\"",

Economic pressures will force countries to exit.\"</p> <p>Scott, a former economic adviser to Tony Blair, described the single currency as \"a doomsday machine that is not only undermining economies but undermining democracy\".</p> <p>He added: \"The question of currency breakup is clearly enormously complex, spanning financial and legal arrangements. We were impressed by a number of the entrants' efforts to grapple with these issues. We felt it was only fair to give finalists the opportunity to refine their thoughts.\"</p>",

Jurre Herman won \u20ac100 (\u00a383) in gift vouchers for his devastatingly simple contingency plan for a breakup of the eurozone. Herman suggested Greeks should be forced to swap their euros for drachmas, so the Greek government could pay back its debts with the euros it collects. Any sceptics will surely be convinced by his drawing, which demonstrates a Greek guy, who \"does not look happy!!\", delivering his euros to the bank. Herman explains: \"All these euros together form a pancake or a pizza (see on top in the picture). Now the Greek government can start to pay back all their debts, everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza.\" While his fellow shortlisted and commended entrants boast impressive biographies listing their professorial chairs, advisory roles, bestselling tomes and multiple qualifications, Jurre's says that he lives with his family, his pet dog and a bird and has \"five friends with whom he plays all day, mostly outside\". But showing an impressive understanding of economics, he notes: \"The Greek people do not want to exchange their euros for drachmas because they know that this drachma will lose its value dramatically.\" To tackle this thorny issue, he plans to fine those Greeks hiding their euros or transferring them to other European countries, by doubling the amount of euros they tried to hide. \"In this way I ensure that all Greeks bring their euros to a Greek bank and so the Greek government can pay back all the debts. I hope my idea helps you!!!!\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> - under pressure recently on concerns about its drugs pipeline and growth prospects - has edged higher after news of a collaboration with US group Amgen.</p> <p>Late on Monday Astra announced a partnership to jointly develop and sell five biotech drugs currently in Amgen's pipeline. Astra will make an upfront payment of $50m to the US group, and the two will share costs and profits on developing the drugs.</p> <p>Astra has been tipped to make an acquisition to boost its faltering growth, with possible targets said to be US groups Forest Laboratories and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which has already rejected an offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p> <p>Astra is up 16.5p to 2841.5p, but the news has received a mixed reaction in the City. Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon, who has a buy recommendation, said:</p> <blockquote> A sigh of relief that the deal which was for weeks looking imminent turns out to be none other than a programme deal with Amgen, but with financial details sparse, we estimate the cost of this deal to be in the region of $250m per annum in 2013 and 2014 when most of the heavy lifting will be done.

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca - under pressure recently on concerns about its drugs pipeline and growth prospects - has edged higher after news of a collaboration with US group Amgen. Late on Monday Astra announced a partnership to jointly develop and sell five biotech drugs currently in Amgen's pipeline. Astra will make an upfront payment of $50m to the US group, and the two will share costs and profits on developing the drugs. Astra has been tipped to make an acquisition to boost its faltering growth, with possible targets said to be US groups Forest Laboratories and Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which has already rejected an offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Astra is up 16.5p to 2841.5p, but the news has received a mixed reaction in the City. Savvas Neophytou at Panmure Gordon, who has a buy recommendation, said: A sigh of relief that the deal which was for weeks looking imminent turns out to be none other than a programme deal with Amgen, but with financial details sparse, we estimate the cost of this deal to be in the region of $250m per annum in 2013 and 2014 when most of the heavy lifting will be done. A fair price, some might say, with the economics of success particularly pleasing. For AstraZeneca investors, the deal is a non-dilutive way to replenish its pipeline and is clearly preferable to large-scale M&amp;A. To boot, the assets under license are biologicals, which plugs a gap and provides a better balance to the pipeline. More deals of this nature are expected. But Dr Mike Mitchell at Seymour Pierce repeated his reduce rating, saying: On first glance, there still appears plenty to iron out on this collaboration: investors will immediately notice that the majority of the portfolio subject to the agreement is in the very early stages of clinical development.

And Naresh Chouhan at Liberum Capital said the Amgen move was good news but did not change the need for Astra to do a deal: We still believe AstraZeneca will have to do something, there isn't enough of the economics retained by Astra and the earnings are too far away. Overall leading shares have now gone into reverse after a bright start and Monday's 1.85% surge. The FTSE 100 is now down 9.77 points at 5865.12.
