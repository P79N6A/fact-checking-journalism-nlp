      "bodyText": "Clothes retailer American Apparel has been reprimanded by the Advertising Standards Authority for \"offensive\" adverts for schoolwear that had the \"potential to normalise predatory sexual behaviour\" towards young women. Two images, one from the brand's website and another from its page on the social media site Instagram, featured a young woman bending over in a short skirt so that her underwear is visible. The images, which the advertising watchdog said were linked to the brand's \"School Days\" and \"Back to School\" ranges, were edited so \"the focus was on her buttocks and groin rather than on the skirt being modelled\". ASA said the ads imitated voyeuristic \"up-skirt\" photographs taken without the subject's consent. It is the sixth time in the past two and a half years that the watchdog has banned ads by the US fashion chain for the portrayal of young women. \"We considered the ads had the effect of inappropriately sexualising school-age girls and were therefore offensive and irresponsible,\" ASA said in a ruling that follows protests on social media last month when the images first appeared. In April 2012 ASA said a series of adverts \"inappropriately sexualised young women\" and December that year another was judged to have \"inappropriately sexualised a model who appeared to be a child\". Last year the watchdog said images on the retailer's website were \"gratuitous\" and gave the \"impression that the women were vulnerable and in sexually provocative poses\". In its latest ruling, ASA told the firm to ensure its future advertising was \"prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society\". In its response to complaints about the adverts, American Apparel said its approach \"was not graphic, explicit or pornographic, but was designed to show a range of different images of people who were natural, not posed and real\". It added that the models were \"happy, relaxed and confident in expression and pose\", and that the model in the ads was 30 and was one of its photographers. The firm said the ads were not intended to represent an underage model or to be linked to any \"Back to School\" marketing effort. The latest criticism of the retailer comes as it investigates alleged misconduct by its founder, and now suspended chief executive, Dov Charney, who was voted out by its board in June. Charney, who has faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct, is currently acting as a consultant to the brand. The company's website says he oversees the majority of its \"creative content\" including ads.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain has moved up a list of the world's best performing economies, according to a global thinktank that praised the government for reducing the public sector deficit and maintaining one of the most flexible labour markets in the developed world. The World Economic Forum said Britain had improved its performance over the last year, moving it from 10th to 9th place, behind the Netherlands and above Sweden. In a report welcomed by the Treasury, the WEF said a wealth of sophisticated businesses and a willingness to adopt new technologies put Britain in a healthy position to improve productivity over the next few years. But it warned in its annual performance monitor that British businesses still struggled to access credit, the workforce remained inadequately trained and tax rates were complex and too high. The Geneva-based thinktank, which has come to prominence as a club for the rich and powerful to debate global business issues, rewarded Switzerland with the top spot for the sixth year running, while Singapore ranked second for the fourth consecutive year. Striking a less positive note in an overview of the global economy, it voiced concern about further unrest in Ukraine and the lack of structural reforms in most countries that needed to increase productivity. \"The strained global geopolitical situation, the rise of income inequality, and the potential tightening of financial conditions could put the still tentative recovery at risk and call for structural reforms to ensure more sustainable and inclusive growth,\" said Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF. Several high-profile international bodies have warned that the global recovery is threatened by the escalating conflict in Ukraine in addition to the continued weakness of the European economy. The Washington-based International Monetary Fund and Paris-based Organisation of Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) have downgraded their global economic forecasts this year in response to a poor performance by the eurozone economies and the prospect of further economic sanctions being imposed on Moscow. The WEF's Global Competitiveness Index, which uses a string of measures to assess the performance of 144 economies, found there was \"insufficient progress in adopting and implementing structural reforms necessary for long-term economic growth\". The thinktank has argued for business and labour to end restrictive practices that hold back investment in new ways of working and technological developments. Britain is praised for its \"efficient labour market\", which is ranked 5th in the world, and for the uptake of technology, for which it is ranked 5th. The quick adoption of new technologies, according to the WEF, is \"coupled with a highly competitive and large market that allows for highly sophisticated and innovative businesses to spring up and develop\". But the thinktank said: \"The country should look into effective ways to raise the overall quality of its education system, which ranks 23rd, most notably in the areas of mathematics and science, which will be crucial to continue fostering innovation in the country.\" Britain has moved up and down the WEF league in recent years, from 10th in 2011 to eighth the following year and back to 10th last year. This year Japan jumped three places to sixth and the US moved two places into the third spot. Japan was praised for its industrial strength and competitiveness, despite running a debt worth 240% of its GDP, three times the ratio in the UK, and an annual budget deficit around twice as high as Britain at 10%. Like the UK, the US was commended for its high level of business sophistication, university system and innovative tech sector. The chancellor, George Osborne, said the index was \"further evidence that our long term economic plan is seen by the world to be delivering a more competitive economy\". He highlighted the direct link drawn by the WEF between a credible fiscal policy and \"our country's ability to attract business and create jobs is compelling\". Osborne argued the UK had regained its reputation for low business taxes, which he said was confirmed by KPMG's 2013 survey of tax competitiveness, which ranked the UK as the most attractive tax regime compared with the US, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Where the UK stands on: Institutions Country ranks highly for guarding property rights, keeping corruption to a minimum and for its well-oiled legal system. It ranks 7th for its legal system and 8th for its ability to safeguard intellectual property. Infrastructure Country ranks 27th for overall infrastructure quality behind not only the US and Japan, but also Portugal, Spain, Malaysia, Bahrain and Barbados. It ranks 51st in terms of the number of mobile phone registrations per head. Other measures of infrastructure are almost as unflattering. It ranks 30th for road quality. It fares better when its electricity supply is judged after it came 12th and it comes 16th for rail quality in a poll won unsurprisingly by Japan and second placed Switzerland. Technology Country ranks fourth in a poll of businesses asked about the availability of the latest technologies, behind Finland, the US and Norway. Internet usage is strong and the UK ranks 9th for the number of internet users and 7th for the number of fixed broadband users. It ranks second for the quality of its scientific research behind Switzerland and above Israel. Education The education system in Britain is not good at meeting the challenges of a competitive economy according to the WEF, which ranks the UK 23rd. Our post-school further education is poor, ranking 36th, just above Germany and below Italy. But secondary education is worse, putting in a poor display at 54, above the US at 59 but below Mongolia, which is ranked at 22. Management schools fare better in 5th place.",

Former Treasury secretary Tim Geithner, similarly, chose to lead his post-Washington career at Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm that manages $35bn but is almost entirely unknown to people outside the finance profession. Five-star general David Petraeus, who resigned as director of the CIA over a sex scandal, joined private equity firm KKR in 2012 \u2013 a firm known to the American public, if at all, as the major player behind the RJR Nabisco takeover enumerated in Barbarians at the Gate. Big banks once drew the biggest political names, as Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston both did when they hired the late diplomat Richard Holbrooke. Similarly, Citigroup famously hired former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin in 1999 after he argued in favor of the company\u2019s plans to merge into a financial supermarket in contravention of the securities laws of the time. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan joined not one, but three Wall Street firms in 2007: bond-trading firm PIMCO, hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co, and Deutsche Bank. One of the most infamous \u2013 and successful \u2013 cases of such \u201crevolving door\u201d hirings was the Swiss bank UBS\u2019s hiring of former senator Phil Gramm in 2003. Gramm co-authored the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, a seminal piece of legislation that reversed the Glass-Steagall Act and allowed commercial banks and investment banks to merge. Gramm helped advise financial services companies including Visa and built up UBS\u2019s lobbying arm.",

      "bodyText": "National Grid has called on electricity suppliers to declare how much spare capacity they could muster to cover peak times either side of Christmas \u2013 highlighting the possibility of power shortages this winter. The power network is officially bringing forward by a year a scheme to tap additional capacity to cope with closures of nuclear, gas, coal and oil power stations and unexpected plant repairs. The prospect of power shortages is likely to alarm ministers, who are concerned that an already depleted system could be exposed by a small number of temporary shutdowns at crucial plants. Britain is already facing a power capacity crunch as ageing and polluting stations are shutting down, while new plants are slow to start operating because of a government overhaul of energy policy. National Grid said it was extending its search for additional sources of temporary supplies to keep the lights on and support heavy industries that use large amounts of electricity. It is looking for additional supplies for the two months before and after Christmas. \"At this stage we don't know if these reserve services will be needed, but they could provide an additional safeguard,\" said Cordi O'Hara, National Grid's director of UK market operations. The grid cited emergency shutdowns at two UK nuclear power stations operated by French firm EDF and fires at a large coal-powered plant and and another fuelled by biomass. National Grid formally launched a tender for its Supplemental Balancing Reserve on Tuesday, asking power generators how much spare capacity they could provide to fill a potential supply gap. The fires were at E.ON's biomass-fuelled Ironbridge plant in Shropshire and SSE's Ferrybridge plant in Yorkshire, forcing them to reduce output; while a power plant in Barking, east London is to close and there have been production problems at EDF Energy's Heysham and Hartlepool nuclear power stations. If the network operator decides SBR is necessary this winter, it will launch a competitive tender for a specific amount of spare capacity. Power generators would have to be available to provide additional electricity between 7am and 9pm from November to February. The new back-up capacity mechanism is in parallel with a programme that allows National Grid to ask contracted users \u2013 mostly factories \u2013 to reduce electricity demand when the system is strained. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 September 2014. An earlier version suggested that the Ironbridge power station was coal-powered.",

    "webTitle": "Supermarkets back novelty Christmas jumpers as onesie popularity fades", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was the trend that allowed adults to dress like toddlers \u2013 and not just in the privacy of their own homes. In one of the most unlikely fashion hits of recent years, Harry Styles, Brad Pitt, Jessie J and Justin Bieber were all spotted sporting onesies. But this year, high street retailers believe the all-in-one may have finally had its day. Instead they are backing novelty Christmas jumpers to be this season's must-have winter warmer for adults and children alike. For Sainsbury's, which sold a Christmas jumper every 22 seconds last year, this year is all about items from bobble hats shaped like Christmas trees to pudding-tipped mittens. The grocer's buyers have put in orders for five times as many as they stocked last year. Adults will be offered a similar array. But it means the onesie is likely to be consigned to fashion history, as James Brown, Sainsbury's non-food trading director, said: \"We don't really see growth this year in onesies.\" He believes adults will be switching from the outsized babygrows to what could be termed the twosie \u2013 festive-themed outfits that sit somewhere between pyjamas and a tracksuit. \"It will be more about the two-piece and outfits that match head to toe,\" he said. \"Last year we had a Christmas pudding hat which sold out in a week. This year we'll be selling socks, headbands, handbags and hats with bells on.\" Asda said it was also favouring novelty accessories over the onesie. \"I think the onesie has probably had its day,\" said a spokeswoman. The supermarket has slightly reduced its range but, by contrast, is increasing its range of jumpers by 62%. \"We are going after Christmas jumpers for all the family: Mum, Dad, the kids and the dog,\" the spokeswoman said. Retail insiders said the industry was nervous about how it was going to replace the onesie craze, which was popular with all ages. Clare Varga, head of youth, active and kidswear at trends agency WGSN, said: \"I think the onesie is past its peak but a lot of the originators of the trend are looking for an evolution.\" Like Brown, she is expecting sport-influenced two-pieces with a more clever interpretation of kitsch to be popular with teenagers. She added: \"The whole novelty thing hasn't gone away. It has become standard and the more outrageous these items are the better. That's become part and parcel of the high street's seasonal offering.\" The soaring popularity of festive outfits has not only been driven by celebrities, from Styles to Phillip Schofield, but by school and workplace charity events such as Save the Children's Christmas Jumper Day in December. \"Christmas novelty is becoming an event in the same way as Halloween,\" said John Carolan, Sainsbury's kidswear boss. \"So many children now have Christmas jumper day or 'dress as you like' day ahead of Christmas that the most important thing is what they are looking for.

      "body": "<p>It was the trend that allowed adults to dress like toddlers \u2013 and not just in the privacy of their own homes. In one of the most unlikely fashion hits of recent years, Harry Styles, Brad Pitt, Jessie J and Justin Bieber were all spotted sporting onesies.</p> <p>But this year, high street retailers believe the all-in-one may have finally had its day. Instead they are backing novelty Christmas jumpers to be this season's must-have winter warmer for adults and children alike.</p> <p>For Sainsbury's, which sold a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/22/christmas-jumpers-festive-stitch-up\" title=\"\">Christmas jumper every 22 seconds</a> last year, this year is all about items from bobble hats shaped like Christmas trees to pudding-tipped mittens. The grocer's buyers have put in orders for five times as many as they stocked last year. Adults will be offered a similar array.</p> <p>But it means the onesie is likely to be consigned to fashion history, as James Brown, Sainsbury's non-food trading director, said: \"We don't really see growth this year in onesies.\"</p> <p>He believes adults will be switching from the outsized babygrows to what could be termed the twosie \u2013 festive-themed outfits that sit somewhere between pyjamas and a tracksuit. \"It will be more about the two-piece and outfits that match head to toe,\" he said. \"Last year we had a Christmas pudding hat which sold out in a week. This year we'll be selling socks, headbands, handbags and hats with bells on.\"</p> <p>Asda said it was also favouring novelty accessories over the onesie. \"I think the onesie has probably had its day,\" said a spokeswoman. The supermarket has slightly reduced its range but, by contrast, is increasing its range of jumpers by 62%. \"We are going after Christmas jumpers for all the family: Mum, Dad, the kids and the dog,\" the spokeswoman said.</p> <p>Retail insiders said the industry was nervous about how it was going to replace the onesie craze, which was popular with all ages.</p> <p>Clare Varga, head of youth, active and kidswear at trends agency WGSN, said: \"I think the onesie is past its peak but a lot of the originators of the trend are looking for an evolution.\" Like Brown, she is expecting sport-influenced two-pieces with a more clever interpretation of kitsch to be popular with teenagers.</p> <p>She added: \"The whole novelty thing hasn't gone away. It has become standard and the more outrageous these items are the better. That's become part and parcel of the high street's seasonal offering.\"</p> <p>The soaring popularity of festive outfits has not only been driven by celebrities, from Styles to Phillip Schofield, but by school and workplace charity events such as Save the Children's Christmas Jumper Day in December.</p> <p>\"Christmas novelty is becoming an event in the same way as Halloween,\" said John Carolan, Sainsbury's kidswear boss. \"So many children now have Christmas jumper day or 'dress as you like' day ahead of Christmas that the most important thing is what they are looking for. There's also a really fun thing happening where people are dressing up in outfits to take pictures for their Christmas cards.\"</p> <p>It's not just clothing that is reflecting the UK's new taste for kitsch. M&amp;S has a Christmas cake trimmed with LED lights and is promoting a \"gold G&amp;T\" \u2013 a gin infused with tea that contains gold flakes. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jul/05/christmas-food-retailers-launch-early\" title=\"\">Lidl is offering reindeer carpaccio among this year's luxury foods while glitter and sparkles are expected to feature on supermarket shelves</a> as much as they did last year.</p> <p>But with sales of groceries rising at their slowest rate in almost a decade, supermarkets are looking to clothing as an alternative source of growth.

      "bodyText": "Aston Martin has hired a senior Nissan executive to be its new boss, marking a coup for the embattled British sports carmaker. Andy Palmer, the group's product and planning chief, quit on Tuesday after 23 years with the Japanese company. He was a lieutenant to Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn and is rated among the most influential Britons in the global car industry. Last year he was also named the world's third most influential marketing executive, behind his counterparts at Apple and Samsung. Palmer, 51, who started his career as an apprentice, will take over as Aston Martin chief executive after a transition period from his current employer, the 101-year-old carmaker said. Privately owned Aston Martin, the brand of choice for fictional spy James Bond, had been leaderless for nine months and is struggling to stay competitive with larger rivals and fund investments in new vehicle and engine technologies. Palmer's background and experience \u2013 including leadership of Nissan's luxury Infiniti brand \u2013 will be instrumental in taking Aston Martin forward, the loss-making firm said. The move adds to a series of high-level departures at the Renault-Nissan alliance that began last year with Carlos Tavares, Ghosn's chief operating officer at Renault. Like British-born Palmer, Tavares was seen as a potential Ghosn successor, and went on to take the helm at PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn this year after reportedly being approached for the Aston Martin chief executive vacancy. Palmer, who joined Nissan in 1991, is seen by peers as a key contributor to the Japanese carmaker's success and increasingly global outlook. He also spearheaded a co-operation with Daimler.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up. Quick summary follows: The pound has hit a five-month low, down over a cent against the US dollar, after the latest polling data showed a surge in support for Scottish independence. The gap between Yes and No is now just six points, with a majority of younger voters favouring breaking away from the UK. The cost of insuring against the pound\u2019s volatility has jumped, as analysts predict mayhem in the markets if the Yes side win. Neville Hill, head of European economics at Credit Suisse, has warned that a yes vote \u201cwould precipitate a significant financial accident,\u201d \u201cGiven that there are no terms of reference, or contingency plans for Scottish independence if there is a \u2018yes\u2019 vote, this has the potential to deliver enormous financial, economic and, of course, political risk to the U.K.\u201d And French bank SocGen predicts the pound could tumble by 5% if Yes win the referendum. Full Story: Pound slides after latest Scottish independence poll Britain\u2019s construction sector is running out of trained builders as growth surges again, pushing up wages and making raw materials scarce. Full story: Construction skills shortage fears temper surge in building The IMF has flagged up that Ukraine may need another bailout, if the conflict in Eastern Ukraine is not resolved. The US has claimed the prize of the fastest-growing factory sector, after the latest PMI reports showed activity leap last month. But Switzerland has been hit by the weakness of the eurozone economy. It failed to grow last quarter, as export growth slowed sharply. Goodnight. GW The Scottish polling data has given the markets a large helping of their least favourite dish - uncertainty. So says Chris Beauchamp of IG: Fresh five-month lows are being seen in GBP/USD this afternoon, thanks to polls that indicate a swing to the \u2018Yes\u2019 camp in the Scottish referendum. This has overridden the better reading this morning from the UK construction sector, which showed impressive growth. With less than three weeks until the election, the evident worry is that the divorce of Scotland from the rest of the UK will be a lot messier, with all the attendant worries about the sharing (or non-sharing) of the debt burden and potential currency arrangements. Markets hate uncertainty, and the Scottish referendum is providing this in spades. The London stock exchange, though, has seen much less drama. The FTSE 100 is down just 0.01% this afternoon as the trading day comes to a close. Other European markets are showing small gains, on hopes of fresh stimulus (or at least hints of future action) from the European Central Bank on Thursday. JP Morgan has added today\u2019s US factory data to yesterday\u2019s surveys, and concluded that global manufacturing growth was unchanged in August. The US lead the way, and France brought up the rear. Back to the Scottish referendum...and analyst Alan Monks of JPMorgan says that the chance of a Yes vote has risen, but perhaps not by as much as the six-point gap reported by YouGov last night suggests. Monks reckons that there is a significant bias towards the status quo, when people are asked to vote on major constitutional reform. This bias could be more significant on 18th September than is evident in any of the polls on voting intentions we discuss. For this reason, our view is this: while the chances of a vote for independence has increased from the 20-25% probability we expressed a few weeks ago, we do not think the probability is quite as high as some of the recent polls suggest. Polls can of course be misleading. But in the absence of other clear signs of trend, we await more such surveys to get a clearer gauge of momentum in the run up to the referendum. As I was saying.... The International Monetary Fund has warned that Ukraine will suffer a deeper recession than previously thought and may need more financial help, as the conflict with Russia continues. In a new report, the IMF predicted that Ukraine\u2019s GDP will shrink by 6.5%, down from 5% before. It also fears that Ukraine might need extra funding totalling $19bn in the \u2018adverse scenario\u2019 where the unrest in its eastern regions last until the end of next year. The IMF also warned that some of the targets set in Ukraine\u2019s original bailout are now out of reach: IMF SAYS TWO KEY RISKS FROM UKRAINE PROGRAM HAVE MATERIALIZED: INTENSIFIED CONFLICT IN EASTERN REGION AND ESCALATION OF KIEV\u2019S GAS DISPUTE WITH GAZPROM IMF SAYS UKRAINE\u2019S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, BUDGET EXECUTION HAVE BEEN AFFECTED IMF SAYS UKRAINE\u2019S BANKING SECTOR COPING WITH LARGER THAN ANTICIPATED DEPOSIT OUTFLOWS IMF SAYS UKRAINE\u2019S HRYVNIA CURRENCY REACHED MORE DEPRECIATED LEVEL THAN EXPECTED, INFLATION ON THE RISE IMF SAYS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN EASTERN UKRAINE DECLINING MORE THAN IN REST OF THE COUNTRY IMF SAYS SOME INITIAL PROGRAM TARGETS FOR UKRAINE \u2018IN JEOPARDY,\u2019 SOME TARGETS FOR END-2014 ARE OUT OF REACH Update: the pound has now dipped below $1.65.... The pound has fallen further, as the strong American factory data pushes up the US dollar. The prospects of Scotland breaking away from the UK continue to hit sterling. The pound is now down 1 cent, or 0.65%, to $1.6503 right now, close to a five-month low. Those two surveys, from ISM and Markit, are pretty conclusive that America\u2019s manufacturing sector just enjoyed a blowout month. Quite a contrast with Europe. Yesterday, the eurozone manufacturing PMI hit a 13-month low of just 50.7, showing factory growth grinding to a near-halt. And the UK PMI hit a 14-month low, of 52.5, showing slower growth. And the rival measure of the US factory sector, from ISM, has also shown strong growth, just like Markit a few minutes ago. The ISM PMI index jumped to 59.0, up from 57.1 which is the highest since March 2011. It also found a big jump in new orders. Just in. America\u2019s factory sector posted its fastest growth in over four years, according to data firm Markit. Markit\u2019s US manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index came in at 57.9, up from 55.8 in July. Any reading over 50 shows growth, and this is the sharpest improvement in conditions since April 2010. The new orders index surged to 60.5, up from 59.5, showing an influx of business. And that encouraged firms to take on more staff too. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at Markit said: \u201cThe US manufacturing sector has gone from strength to strength this summer, with August\u2019s improvement in business conditions the sharpest for over four years. \u201cImpressive new business and output gains were matched by a solid rebound in employment growth. The latest survey points to the fastest upturn in payroll numbers for around a year-and-a-half, highlighting that the manufacturing sector continues to have a positive impact on overall labor market conditions. \u201cImproving domestic economic fundamentals remain the key engine of growth. However, there were finally signs of external demand gaining traction in August, despite weakness across the euro area, as manufacturers indicated that new export orders picked up at the fastest pace for three years.\u201d My colleague in Berlin, Ben Knight, writes that car pick-up service Uber is fighting on after being slapped with a ban in Germany: The car sharing service Uber has been hit with a temporary ban in Germany after a court in Frankfurt ruled that the mobile app violates the country\u2019s Passenger Transportation Act. The ruling came into force on Tuesday following an expedited hearing. It means the ban remains in place until a full hearing takes place and Uber could face a \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3198,000) fine per ride. Uber has vowed to keep the app online regardless of the ban. \u201cYou cannot put the brakes on progress,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cUber will continue its operations and will offer Uberpop ridesharing services via its app throughout Germany.\u201d More here: Car sharing service Uber banned in Germany Just in. Halliburton, the US contractor, has reached a $1.1bn settlement over its role in the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2011. Halliburton handled the cement work for the BP oil rig which caught fire and sunk in April 2011, with the loss of 11 lives, causing the huge environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. It says it has reached a deal on \u201ca substantial majority of the plaintiffs\u2019 class claims\u201d, following the deal which BP reached with local businesses two years ago. That includes: Claims against Halliburton that BP assigned to the settlement class in BP\u2019s April 2012 settlement, Punitive damages claims against Halliburton by a class of plaintiffs who allege damages to property or associated with the commercial fishing industry arising from the Deepwater Horizon Incident, and Affirmation that Halliburton has no liability for compensatory damages to the members of the settlement class in the BP April 2012 settlement. A reminder of how the cost of insuring against the pound being volatile this month has surged this morning, following the Scottish independence polling. The pound hasn\u2019t recovered either - still down 0.8 of a cent at $1.562. So why is the City so worried? Well, until now, investors had largely discounted the prospect of the Yes side winning, but the six-point gap has forced a rethink. And as our new data editor, Alberto Nardelli, explains, the Yes side are winning among the younger demographics: The government is inviting suggestions for measures that the chancellor could announce in December\u2019s autumn statement. In the interest of \u201copen and transparent policy-making\u201d, the Treasury is keen to consider \u201coriginal and innovative ideas\u201d which could be included in the fiscal update. So, if you\u2019d like to, say, abolish the bedroom tax or impose a windfall levy on the banks, please email autumnstatementrepresentations@hmtreasury.gsi.gov.uk. Get your diaries out. George Osborne will deliver the autumn statement on December 3rd. Brace yourselves for new financial forecasts; eagerly waited, with the general election just five months later. The reshaping of Britain\u2019s Co-operative Group continues. It just announced the sale of its security arm, Sunwin Services, to US firm Cardtronics for \u00a341.5m in cash. Cardtronics is also going to run the 1,800 cash machines across the Co-op\u2019s supermarkets for seven years, starting January 2016 at the latest. Sunwin was created in the 1950s, when the Co-op got into the TV rental and repair business. These days, its role is to supervise and protect the movement of cash around the Co-Operative empire. Last weekend, Co-operative\u2019s members agreed to wide-ranging changes to the way it runs. But City grandees Lord Myners warned that it must now appoint a fully independent chairman, and CEO, to avoid the reform process failing. So what does this morning\u2019s jump in sterling volatility actually mean? Basically, it shows that the cost of hedging against the risk of the pound\u2019s value fluctuating wildly over the next month has risen. Traders are seeking protection against turmoil as the Scottish independence vote approaches. Reuters newswire snap: 02-Sep-2014 11:23 - STERLING 1-MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY POSTS BIGGEST JUMP IN 3 YEARS ON SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE POLL The pound is continuing to fall against the US dollar this morning. It\u2019s now down 0.8 of a cent, or 0.5%, at $1.6526 today, as traders adjust their view of this month\u2019s Scottish referendum on independence. Last night\u2019s opinion poll, showing a mere 6-point gap between No and Yes (see details at 9.29am), has also pushed up volatility in the sector -- a sign that City investors are bracing for a possible shock on 18 September. I flagged up earlier that the pound could swiftly tumble by 5% if Scotland votes for independence. Now Neville Hill, head of European economics at Credit Suisse, has warned that a yes vote \u201cwould precipitate a significant financial accident,\u201d Hill said (via the WSJ): \u201cGiven that there are no terms of reference, or contingency plans for Scottish independence if there is a \u2018yes\u2019 vote, this has the potential to deliver enormous financial, economic and, of course, political risk to the U.K.\u201d Looking back at the booming UK construction sector....building firm Redrow has revealed it expanded its workforce by a fifth last year to cope with the demand. My colleague Jennifer Rankin reports: Redrow said it had created 230 jobs, including 48 apprenticeships, amid the housing market revival. The new recruits include surveyors, planners, and sales and marketing experts, while the company\u2019s expansion may have created up to five times as many jobs on the building sites managed by its contractors, according to John Tutte, Redrow chief executive. \u201cWhen we create 230 jobs we create many more in the supply chain \u2026 you could say one job could easily create four or five in the supply chain.\u201d And with profits up 91%, I imagine Redrow won\u2019t struggle to pay staff a little more..... Redrow homebuilder adds 20% more staff as profits nearly double Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says this latest drop in eurozone producer prices is a worrying sign for the region: It is looking ever more likely that the European Central Bank will ultimately have to undertake some form of quantitative easing QE, although we suspect that it will be limited given apparent wariness among some Governing Council members to go down this route. The ECB may well initially at least limit itself to buying Asset Backed Securities rather than government bonds. The ECB press conference this Thursday should be very interesting and we expect Mr. Draghi to adopt a more dovish tone, Archer adds. The latest economic news from the eurozone is less encouraging, though. Producer prices (which measures the cost of goods and services from euro firms \u2018at the factory gate\u2019) fell by 0.1% month-on-month in July, and were 1.1% lower than a year ago. It\u2019s the sixth month-on-month fall in producer prices so far this year (June was a rare highlight, when PP rose by 0.2%). The fall was driven by cheaper energy supplies (down 0.6% month-on-month). Capital goods, durable goods, and non-durable consumer goods were all unchanged. On an annual basis, \u2018core\u2019 producer prices (stripping out volatile items such as energy) were flat month-on-month in July. Reaction to follow... This shortage of skilled construction workers could suggest that the spare capacity in the UK labour market is being sucked up. Something for the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee to ponder, as Rob Wood of Berenberg explains: The strength of construction output has raised capacity pressures, which were reflected in further rises in sub-contractor charges. If that trend of falling capacity is reflected in other sectors in the coming months it could become an issue for the Bank of England, who are currently assuming there is still enough slack in the economy to allow interest rates to stay on hold until next year. The MPC starts its two-day monthly meeting tomorrow. Last month, two members voted to raise rates, but Berenberg expect the BoE will not hike until next February. Paul Kavanagh of City firm Killik &amp; Co reminds me that builders have already seen their wages rise this year: Almost a year ago, we were writing that the Housing boom had produced the year of the \u00a340k brickie It\u2019s a good time to be a skilled builder, points out Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency exchange company, World First. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s unexpectedly strong construction data: \u201cThe UK construction market is booming at the moment. Output and orders continue to fly higher, while the employment of skilled sub-contractor labour has contracted so much that availability has fallen to a record low and rates to a record high. \u201cIt is a good time to be working in construction if you have the skill-set. Gains appear to have been made across all three divisions \u2013 housing, commercial and civil engineering \u2013 of the construction sector driving confidence higher still. \u201cAccording to the survey, eight times as many firms believe that the sector will continue expanding over the year ahead as opposed to seeing declines. \u201cPrice data was also strong with input inflation expanding at the strongest levels since July 2011; good news for margins in the short term, but a continuation is contingent on reliable progression onward.\u201d David Noble, Group CEO at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, is worried by the shortage of skilled builders, and the pressure on raw materials: \u201cThe sector is struggling to find enough skilled tradesmen to keep pace with new work and the labour market will continue to put pressure on costs until the next wave of apprentices begin to enter the jobs market. \u201cIndeed, across the supply chain, delivery times have seen the sharpest rise since the survey began, with input prices growing at the fastest rate since July 2011. With the UK\u2019s appetite for building materials growing throughout the summer, suppliers are struggling to ramp up production to pre-crisis levels.\u201d One person\u2019s cost pressures is another person\u2019s well-earned pay rise, of course.... The UK construction sector has posted its strongest jump in activity in seven month, raising fears of a shortage of skilled staff. Builders have reported a \u201csurge\u201d in housebuilding, and a rise in commercial and civil engineering last month. The UK construction PMI, calculated by Markit, has risen to 64.0, up from 62.4, indicating an acceleration in growth. That\u2019s the strongest reading since January, and one of the best in the last seven years. Firms reported that a \u201csustained upturn in workloads\u201d, and a rise in confidence -- which encourage them to hire more workers. Housebuilding posted the fastest rise in activity, while civil engineering activity increased at the strongest pace since March. Commercial construction grew at close to the fastest rate since the summer of 2007. Here\u2019s the key points: Markit economist Tim Moore says \u201ca broad-based upturn in construction demand has created a boom in job creation this summer\u201d. \u201cUK construction firms saw one of the sharpest rises in output for seven years in August, with increasing workloads driven by an array of factors including surging homebuilding activity, greater infrastructure spending and renewed confidence within the commercial development sector.\u201d This means some building firms are struggling to find staff. Moore explains: Acute skill shortages meant that sub- contractor charges rose at the fastest pace since the survey began in 1997. Meanwhile, sub-contractor availability fell at a survey-record pace, which could act to further ignite pay pressures in the short term. Reaction to follow.... The pound has dipped against the US dollar this morning after a poll showed the Yes to Independence camp gaining ground in the Scottish referendum battle. It\u2019s not a big move -- sterling is down about 0.3% today. One pound is worth $1.6564, down from $1.66 last night before the poll was released. Kit Juckes, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s currency expert, says the City has noted the closing gap between the \u2018No\u2019 and Yes\u2019 camps in the Scottish referendum, to 53-47 in favour of not leaving (excluding don\u2019t knows). Kit explains: A Scottish \u2018yes\u2019 to independence poses far more questions (about the currency, the debt, the oil, the future) than it answers but my best guess is that a \u2018Yes\u2019 would trigger a 3-5% fall by sterling as an initial reaction, compared to an equally unsophisticated guess that the UK leaving the EU sends sterling down 10-15%. He adds that the issue of Scottish independence won\u2019t go away, even if the No side win this month. It is now unlikely that the gap is big enough for a \u2018no\u2019 this time around to kick the issue into the long grass for ever. If, for example, the UK were to leave the EU after a referendum, Mr Salmond would leap back on the bandwagon and apply for an independent Scotland to remain in. And so on. The latest Spanish employment figures are also out this morning, and show a small rise in unemployment. But the underlying picture does show signs of improvement within Spain\u2019s chronically weak labour market. Spain\u2019s jobless total rose by 8,070 in August, meaning there were 4,427,930 people out of work. But on a seasonally adjusted basis, the jobless total actually fell by over 11,000 people -- the second-biggest fall in 14 years. The Labour Ministry reports that 270,853 people have left the unemployment total in the last year, the best figure for any August on record. This chart shows how the jobless total is lower than in 2013 or 2012, although nearly one in four people are still classed as unemployed. Economists are concerned by the evaporation of growth in the Swiss economy in the last quarter. Maxime Botteron of Credit Suisse is worried that capital investment fell, saying: \u201dFor us it\u2019s really below expectations. We expected a bit more growth. The trend in exports is not a big surprise. Trade data so far already pointed to a rather weak contribution of exports. What is a bit more surprising is the weak investment spending, especially in the construction sector.\u201d David Marmet, an economist at Zuercher Kantonalbank, fears that the Switzerland will struggle: \u201cThe global economy isn\u2019t developing as we\u2019d expected,\u201d \u201cWe think the weakness will last into 2015. The pickup will come, but not as strongly as we\u2019d thought.\u201d And the Guardian\u2019s former European editor, David Gow, reckons it shows the risks of Brexit: Bloomberg pins the blame firmly on the weakness of the Eurozone, saying: The Swiss economy lost pace in the second quarter with private consumption failing to make up for slowing exports as stagnating growth in the euro-area took its toll.... Swiss GDP Unexpectedly Stagnates as Euro Area Leaves Mark These are the worst Swiss growth figures in two years, as our friends at fastFT flag up: More here: Swiss economy unexpectedly stalls The full Swiss GDP report is available on the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)\u2018s website. It shows that exports of jewellery made a notable positive contribution to growth. However, the country\u2019s banking sector did not: SECO says: On the production side many sectors reported virtually no change in value added between the 1st and 2nd quarters. Industry, energy and water supply made an overall small positive contribution to GDP growth, by contrast the value added in the financial sector and some public sector economic areas showed a stagnating to slightly falling trend. Today\u2019s GDP report shows that the Swiss economy has suffered a slowdown in export growth. Exports rose by just 0.6% in April-June, down from robust growth of 2.3% in January-March. So, trade in goods and services made a small negative contribution to GDP growth, the Switzerland\u2019s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs says. That suggests Switzerland is feeling the chill from the eurozone \u2013 Germany contracted by 0.2% during this quarter, France also stagnated, and Italy fell into recession again. Switzerland\u2019s construction sector activity fell by 0.7%, and government spending fell by 0.3% - wiping out a rise in consumer consumption. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 first take on the unexpectedly weak Swiss GDP figures released this morning. Switzerland\u2019s economy stalled in the second quarter, with output unchanged from the first, dragged down by weaker exports and falling construction spending, data showed on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a quarterly growth rate of 0.5%. Gross domestic product rose by 0.6% year on year, missing expectations of 1.7% and down from a revised 2.1% in the prior quarter, the State Secretariat for Economics said. Switzerland\u2019s economy faces increased macroeconomic and geopolitical risks that may lead the Swiss National Bank to cut its economic outlook at its meeting in September, its chairman Thomas Jordan said on Sunday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The breaking news this morning is that Switzerland has joined the ranks of European countries suffering a slowdown. GDP figures, just released, show that the Swiss economy failed to grow at all in the second quarter of 2014, with export growth slowing sharply. That\u2019s much worse than expected (the City had pencilled in growth of around 0.5%), and matches the average poor performance across its eurozone neighbours. It\u2019s another sign that economic growth across the European region suffered a dip in April-June. I\u2019ll have more details on this shortly. No shocks overnight - Australia\u2019s central bank has left interest rates unchanged. The financial markets are jittery ahead of Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting, after yesterday\u2019s weak factory growth figures put more pressure on Mario Draghi. In the corporate world, housebuilder Redrow is posting decent-looking results, with profits almost doubling over the last year. We\u2019ll have more on that in a few minutes too. Greek ministers are heading to Paris today for talks with its troika of lenders. But as we reported in yesterday\u2019s blog, Athens is trying to dampen hopes of a breakthrough on debt relief. Finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis told reporters last night that Greece wouldn\u2019t be imposing any \u2018red lines\u2019, and would mainly discuss structural reforms. \u201cIt will be a wide-ranging discussion \u2026. the bar has been raised. We have to bear in mind who the counterparties are. They are members of the International Monetary Fund, the (European) Commission, and the European Central Bank You must understand their limits. They cannot speak politically.\u201d Also on the agenda today: 9.30am BST: UK construction Purchasing Managers Index for August 10am BST: Eurozone producer prices index for July 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI for August (postponed from Monday because of Labour Day) I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A leading accountancy firm and one of its partners has agreed to pay \u00a32m in fines and legal costs for substandard conduct when advising the pension fund of First Quench in 2007. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) has charged Mazars \u00a3750,000 \u2013 a record for a case settled outside a tribunal \u2013 and charged the firm \u00a31.12m in costs. It fined the firm's main partner in the case, Richard Karmel, \u00a350,000 and charged him \u00a380,000 in costs. The FRC reprimanded Mazars for its conduct, which the firm admitted fell short of expected standards. The fine was reduced from \u00a3850,000 because the firm admitted liability and settled. Karmel's fine was cut from \u00a357,00 for the same reason. The case concerned the advice Mazars gave to the trustee of the First Quench pension fund in 2007. First Quench was a wholly owned subsidiary and the main trading business of Threshers, the wine retailer that went bust in 2009. As well as Threshers, its brands included Wine Rack, Bottoms Up and Victoria Wines. The pension fund had a deficit of about \u00a328m in June 2006. After a transfer of ownership in July 2007, three-quarters of Threshers was owned by Vision Capital, a private equity firm, with the rest in the hands of the specialist insurer Pension Corporation. In 2007, Pension Corporation proposed transferring the assets and liabilities of the pension fund away from the Thresher group or into another fund held by a Pension Corporation company, the FRC said. Mazars was hired to advise the trustee of the pension fund, but the FRC found Karmel presented reports to the trustee that exaggerated the case for transferring the fund away from First Quench. The advice did not take into account guidance from the pension regulator, which had become concerned about companies abandoning their pension obligations. Karmel had a conflict of interest because his responsibility was to the pension fund trustee but he acted in the interests of Pension Corporation and not the trustee, according to the FRC. He also breached client confidentiality by disclosing information to Pension Corporation without the trustee's authority. Paul George, the FRC's executive director of conduct, said: \"Accountants must not allow undue influence of others to override their professional judgements and they must have a clear understanding of who their client actually is.\" Mazars, which claims to be Britain's ninth biggest accountancy firm by audit revenue, said Karmel would remain as a partner. A spokesman for Mazars said: \"We regret that our conduct fell below our usual high standards in relation to this 2007 advisory assignment. We are pleased that the FRC accepted that the misconduct was neither dishonest nor deliberate, that we took appropriate remedial steps relating to quality assurance, and that it did not cause any actual loss to the beneficiaries of the pension fund.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's builders enjoyed the strongest growth for seven months in August but the surge in activity put further strain on already tight supplies of materials and skilled workers. Against the backdrop of rising house prices, home building continued to lead the construction rebound. Civil engineering was also buoyed by infrastructure spending and commercial construction grew strongly, according to the Markit/Cips UK construction PMI survey. But there were fresh warnings that skills shortages and pressures on supplies could hamper growth over the rest of the year. That follows a report last week of booming pay deals within the sector as companies struggle to attract bricklayers and other skilled workers. The latest poll of construction businesses flagged up rising pay and materials costs. \"The resurgence in construction has entrenched itself after a summer of blistering growth but builders should prepare for growing pains this autumn as the sector labours to recover lost capacity,\" said David Noble, group chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, one of the groups behind the survey. \"An encouraging 15 months of sustained employment growth \u2013 the longest since 2006-2008 \u2013 is revealing a major skills shortage in the sector.\" The compilers cited a summer boom in job creation, with hiring in August close to the record pace recorded in July. Subcontractor usage surged at the fastest rate since the survey began in April 1997, prompting a record drop in subcontractor availability and a steeper increase in rates charged. Echoing reports of brick shortages from builders, delivery times for building supplies lengthened to the greatest degree since the survey began. The report's main output index jumped from 62.4 in July to 64.0 in August, signalling the largest monthly rise in building activity since January and one of the largest in the survey's history, Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit, noted mixed signals about the future. On the upside, new orders continued to rise strongly in August and business expectations about the year ahead picked up. But he added: \"The concern is that shortages of both raw materials and suitable subcontractors could start causing growth to slow, and could push up inflationary pressures within the sector.\"",

      "body": "<p>Britain's builders enjoyed the strongest growth for seven months in August but the surge in activity put further strain on already tight supplies of materials and skilled workers.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of rising house prices, home building continued to lead the construction rebound. Civil engineering was also buoyed by infrastructure spending and commercial construction grew strongly, according to the Markit/Cips UK construction PMI survey.</p> <p>But there were fresh warnings that skills shortages and pressures on supplies could hamper growth over the rest of the year. That follows a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/28/falling-wages-pay-rises-uk-construction-industry\" title=\"\">report last week of booming pay deals within the sector</a> as companies struggle to attract bricklayers and other skilled workers.</p> <p>The latest poll of construction businesses flagged up rising pay and materials costs.</p> <p>\"The resurgence in construction has entrenched itself after a summer of blistering growth but builders should prepare for growing pains this autumn as the sector labours to recover lost capacity,\" said David Noble, group chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, one of the groups behind the survey.</p> <p>\"An encouraging 15 months of sustained employment growth \u2013 the longest since 2006-2008 \u2013 is revealing a major skills shortage in the sector.\"</p> <p>The compilers cited a summer boom in job creation, with hiring in August close to the record pace recorded in July. Subcontractor usage surged at the fastest rate since the survey began in April 1997, prompting a record drop in subcontractor availability and a steeper increase in rates charged. Echoing reports of brick shortages from builders, delivery times for building supplies lengthened to the greatest degree since the survey began.</p> <p>The report's main output index jumped from 62.4 in July to 64.0 in August, signalling the largest monthly rise in building activity since January and one of the largest in the survey's history,</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compilers Markit, noted mixed signals about the future. On the upside, new orders continued to rise strongly in August and business expectations about the year ahead picked up. But he added: \"The concern is that shortages of both raw materials and suitable subcontractors could start causing growth to slow, and could push up inflationary pressures within the sector.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Housebuilder Redrow increased its workforce by more than a fifth in a year when surging demand for housing sent profits soaring. The revival of the housing market and the government's Help to Buy mortgage-subsidy scheme helped the FTSE 250-listed homebuilder earn record pre-tax profits of \u00a3133m in the year ending 30 June, a 91% increase on last year. The average private sale price of a Redrow property increased by 19% to \u00a3269,000, but the builder said there were signs that prices were moderating, especially in London. Redrow said it had created 230 jobs, including 48 apprenticeships, amid the housing market revival. The new recruits include surveyors, planners and sales and marketing experts, while the company's expansion may have created up to five times as many jobs on the building sites managed by its contractors, according to John Tutte, Redrow chief executive. \"When we create 230 jobs we create many more in the supply chain \u2026 you could say one job could easily create four or five in the supply chain.\" The north Wales-based homebuilder, the largest housebuilder in Wales, with developments across the UK, said Help to Buy accounted for 35% of its private sales, although the scheme had passed its peak. Help to Buy, which was introduced in England in April 2013, gave an unprecedented boost to Redrow's sales in summer 2013. Sales were running at the same rates as the springtime, sparing the housebuilder the usual drop in demand as people go on holiday. Help to Buy was introduced in Wales in January 2014 and the company said it had \"provided a much-needed lift to a depressed market\". This year, sales have returned to a more typical summer sales pattern. Help to Buy has settled down, said Redrow chairman and company founder Steve Morgan. \"What took everyone by surprise was the rate of acceleration last year. What you have seen is that things are settling down to a more sustainable pattern.\" Housebuilders were caught out by last year's sudden recovery, and left scrambling to meet demand amid a shortage of bricks and bricklayers. Tutte said there remained a shortage of some trade jobs, such as bricklayers, but this was not holding back Redrow's expansion. But he warned that the industry had \"a lot of work to do\" to overcome the long-term skills shortage it faced. While the industry was not in a \"desperate\" situation, \"if we don't address it then it will be an impediment to increasing build output\". He added: \"It is an ageing workforce and that needs to be addressed. We won't do it overnight but we are certainly making good strides to improving it.\" He called on the government to do more to ensure that schools are promoting \"fulfilling careers\" in the construction industry, to overcome a long-running bias towards university. \"I don't think careers in housebuilding and construction have been promoted as well as they could be in schools. I think there was this drive for pupils to be encouraged to go to university and follow that pure academic route for a long, long time. Now people are beginning to realise that apprenticeships are really good things to have and they do give people good jobs and work experience.\" Redrow has been expanding its apprenticeship programme in recent years: it employs 84 apprentices (6% of its workforce), with the number set to grow to more than 100. The company has created an apprenticeship programme for surveyors as an alternative to university, although it also increased graduate recruits last year.",
