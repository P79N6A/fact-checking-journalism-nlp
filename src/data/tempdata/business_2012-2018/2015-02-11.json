      "bodyText": "Glencore\u2019s Ivan Glasenberg will trade most things under the sun but here\u2019s one that seems to have defeated him \u2013 the 23.9% holding in Lonmin, the mining company that digs for platinum in South Africa, or at least does so when its workers are not on strike. Glencore\u2019s stake in Lonmin arrived as unwelcome baggage as part of the the former\u2019s takeover of Xstrata in 2013. Glasenberg has never shown great interest in Lonmin, aside from placing a couple of colleagues on its board. One assumes he would have sold the holding if only he could have found a buyer. He hasn\u2019t, so plan B is to hand the shares to Glencore\u2019s own shareholders. This is an unusual distribution \u201cin specie\u201d. Investors will get a cut of the 23.9% stake in proportion to their holdings in Glencore. The handout will be received by most investors with little excitement, one suspects. If they really want a direct stake in Lonmin, they can buy in the market today. Some, the market thinks, will dump their stock at an early opportunity, which is why Lonmin\u2019s share price fell 8%. Even Glasenberg, who owns 8.4% of Glencore, sounded less than enthused by this present to himself. Glencore\u2019s senior managers say they do not currently plan to sell the Lonmin shares they would receive personally \u2013 but they didn\u2019t say what they meant by \u201ccurrently\u201d. One theory says Glasenberg is having one last go at flushing out a buyer. Worth a try, of course, but it\u2019s hard to see who would put up a hand. Platinum mining is horribly dangerous because of the lack of automation; the platinum price is low and has defied predictions of an uptick in demand; and Lonmin comes with the history of the tragedy at its Marikana mine in 2012 when police shot and killed 34 striking workers. If you\u2019re an optimist life can\u2019t get much worse for Lonmin. With shares at 158p, maybe some of its new shareholders will view their holdings as a free option on recovery and see what happens. Nobody, though, will ever share the optimism of Xstrata\u2019s Mick Davis in 2008, who bought the Lonmin stake as part of a failed takeover attempt. He was willing to bid \u00a333 a share. It was a different era for mining, of course. But still: what on earth was Davis thinking? Electra and the awkward squad Shareholders in Electra, the private equity investment trust, last year rightly rejected the attempt by Edward Bramson, the activist investor from Sherborne Investors, to storm the boardroom. Bramson, by trying to install a couple of his men on the board, seemed to be trying to gain control by stealth. And his plan to release \u201cat least\u201d \u00a31bn of extra value from Electra was woolly in the extreme. But Electra\u2019s shareholders still owe Bramson a drink: he seems to have saved them \u00a37m a year in fees. Electra used to allow Electra Partners, the management firm, to apply an across-the-board management fee of 1.5% on all assets in the portfolio. This even included cash in the bank awaiting investment. That was absurd since the skill in leaving funds on deposit is roughly zero. It will no longer be allowed, Electra has decided. Add a few other tweaks on fees and the net result is this: last year, Electra Partners\u2019 fees would have been \u00a318m, not \u00a325m. It is evidence, in case it is still needed, that fee structures in the private equity world are often a racket. Charging to \u201cmanage\u201d cash is obscene if the princelings are also expecting to collect a generous slice of the winnings when the money is put to work and investments turn out well. At Electra, the success fee for Electra Partners \u2013 the \u201ccarried interest\u201d \u2013 will continue to be 18% once a performance hurdle is cleared. Roger Yates, Electra\u2019s chairman, says the reform over fees involved \u201ctough and rigorous negotiations\u201d. Well, maybe. But he failed to explain why the board\u2019s toughness only materialised after Bramson turned up with a 20% stake (now increased to 24%). Shareholders should not have to rely on the arrival of the awkward squad to get a fairer deal. Yates himself can perhaps be excused since he has been in the job less than a year. But his predecessor as chairman, Dame Colette Bowe, now looks a bit of a soft touch. If she disagrees, she can prove her point in her new role as chair of the Banking Standards Review Council, the new body charged with the infinitely harder task of cleaning up the banking industry. Squeeze for jet set Times are tougher in the world of Dettol and Durex. Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor, has decided to lead the corporate cost-cutting drive by example. He has decided to fly economy class on flights of under six hours. It\u2019s easy to sneer, especially as Kapoor can ease any discomfort in the leg department by contemplating his considerable personal rewards (\u00a36.7m last year). But this is a good lead for executives to follow in an age of relentless efficiency exercises. If the directors can\u2019t swallow a small dose of the medicine they dish out, why not? It\u2019s a good question for shareholders to ask at this spring\u2019s annual meetings. An old investment rule said you should always sell the shares if a company acquired a corporate jet. It would be useful to know if companies perform better when the directors go cattle-class on short-haul flights. One suspects the correlation would be close.",

With shares at 158p, maybe some of its new shareholders will view their holdings as a free option on recovery and see what happens. </p> <p>Nobody, though, will ever share the optimism of Xstrata\u2019s Mick Davis in 2008, who bought the Lonmin stake as part of a failed takeover attempt. He was willing to bid \u00a333 a share. It was a different era for mining, of course. But still: what on earth was Davis thinking?</p> <h2><strong>Electra and the awkward squad</strong></h2> <p>Shareholders in Electra, the private equity investment trust, last year rightly rejected the attempt by Edward Bramson, the activist investor from Sherborne Investors, to storm the boardroom. Bramson, by trying to install a couple of his men on the board, seemed to be trying to gain control by stealth. And his plan to release \u201cat least\u201d \u00a31bn of extra value from Electra was woolly in the extreme.</p> <p>But Electra\u2019s shareholders still owe Bramson a drink: he seems to have saved them \u00a37m a year in fees.</p> <p>Electra used to allow Electra Partners, the management firm, to apply an across-the-board management fee of 1.5% on all assets in the portfolio. This even included cash in the bank awaiting investment. That was absurd since the skill in leaving funds on deposit is roughly zero. It will no longer be allowed, Electra has decided. Add a few other tweaks on fees and the net result is this: last year, Electra Partners\u2019 fees would have been \u00a318m, not \u00a325m. </p> <p>It is evidence, in case it is still needed, that fee structures in the private equity world are often a racket. Charging to \u201cmanage\u201d cash is obscene if the princelings are also expecting to collect a generous slice of the winnings when the money is put to work and investments turn out well. At Electra, the success fee for Electra Partners \u2013 the \u201ccarried interest\u201d \u2013 will continue to be 18% once a performance hurdle is cleared. </p> <p>Roger Yates, Electra\u2019s chairman, says the reform over fees involved \u201ctough and rigorous negotiations\u201d. Well, maybe. But he failed to explain why the board\u2019s toughness only materialised after Bramson turned up with a 20% stake (now increased to 24%). Shareholders should not have to rely on the arrival of the awkward squad to get a fairer deal.</p> <p>Yates himself can perhaps be excused since he has been in the job less than a year. But his predecessor as chairman, Dame Colette Bowe, now looks a bit of a soft touch. If she disagrees, she can prove her point in her new role as chair of the Banking Standards Review Council, the new body charged with the infinitely harder task of cleaning up the banking industry.</p> <h2>Squeeze for jet set</h2> <p>Times are tougher in the world of Dettol and Durex. Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s chief executive, Rakesh Kapoor, has decided to lead the corporate cost-cutting drive by example. He has decided to fly economy class on flights of under six hours.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to sneer, especially as Kapoor can ease any discomfort in the leg department by contemplating his considerable personal rewards (\u00a36.7m last year). But this is a good lead for executives to follow in an age of relentless efficiency exercises. If the directors can\u2019t swallow a small dose of the medicine they dish out, why not? It\u2019s a good question for shareholders to ask at this spring\u2019s annual meetings.</p> <p>An old investment rule said you should always sell the shares if a company acquired a corporate jet. It would be useful to know if companies perform better when the directors go cattle-class on short-haul flights. One suspects the correlation would be close.</p>",

Sky, which some analysts believe could have overpaid by more than \u00a3300m, lost 21p to 933p. Tullow Oil dropped 29.7p to 384.6p after making its first loss for 15 years and scrapping its dividend.",

Sources said that Troup was expected to appear with Homer and Jim Harra, the director general of business tax. Troup told the public accounts committee in 2013 that he knew of \u201cthe HSBC Swiss disc\u201d, which has since been leaked to the Guardian and an international consortium of journalists.

Redrow is currently the cheapest stock amongst the housebuilders, and we have moved our target price to 440p. With the interim dividend doubling to 2p, Redrow\u2019s shares have climbed 33.9p or 11% to 330.7p. The strong performance from Redrow has also lifted Persimmon by 44p to \u00a316.57, Barratt Developments by 8.4p to 468.1p and Taylor Wimpey by 1.9p to 138.8p.",

      "bodyText": "Conservative donors, peers and a high-profile MP are listed among the wealthy who legally held accounts in Switzerland with HSBC\u2019s private bank, for a wide variety of reasons. Their ranks include Zac Goldsmith, MP for Richmond Park, plus his brother, the financier Ben Goldsmith, and a Swiss resident, German-born automotive heir Georg von Opel, who has donated six-figure sums in the past two years. Peers named in the HSBC files include Lord Sterling of Plaistow, the P&amp;O shipping and ports entrepreneur who was ennobled by Margaret Thatcher, and Lord Fink, who was a party treasurer under David Cameron and has given \u00a33m to the Conservatives. Zac Goldsmith has, with his brother Ben and their mother Lady Annabel, donated over \u00a3500,000 in cash and in kind to the Conservatives. The Conservatives have raised over \u00a35m from HSBC clients with Swiss accounts, while Labour has also benefited from cash and gifts in kind worth over \u00a3500,000, as well as a loan for \u00a32m. Labour donors who held Swiss accounts with HSBC include the steel magnate Swraj Paul and restaurant owner and clothing entrepreneur Richard Caring, who at various times is recorded to have donated to both Labour and the Conservatives. Von Opel, a major Tory donor named in the HSBC files, is a great-grandson of the German automotive entrepreneur Adam Opel. He has UK homes and a British wife, but told the Guardian he is a Swiss resident. Since moving to Switzerland as a child, Von Opel has been a tax exile, managing his fortune from there. His office said none of Von Opel\u2019s accounts were used for evading or avoiding tax. They added: \u201cMr von Opel \u2026 is a Swiss national and a Swiss resident since 1973.\u201d This has not stopped him from financing British politics. Since December 2012, Von Opel has donated more than \u00a3430,000 to the Conservatives. He owns homes and a business in Britain and has been on the electoral register since 2010, entitling him to make party donations. EU citizens like Von Opel are entitled to vote in local but not national elections. Being a client of a Swiss bank is not illegal and does not prove tax avoidance or evasion. There is no suggestion that any of the individual donors did anything unlawful. A number of political donors found to have Swiss accounts are also high-profile members of Britain\u2019s growing non-dom community \u2013 the tens of thousands of wealthy foreign residents attracted to the UK by a historical quirk which allows them to live in the country without paying inheritance tax or incurring tax on assets owned offshore, by claiming they will eventually retire abroad. Sterling was linked to three HSBC accounts totalling \u00a37.8m. Two of them were for his UK investment businesses while the third was for an offshore trust, the Harry Sterling 1964 Settlement, established by his father. Sterling said the HSBC accounts were opened by Veritas Asset Management, an investment firm which managed his personal and corporate assets, that his financial arrangements were fully declared, and that no tax had been avoided. One of the Conservative party\u2019s recent treasurers, Lord Fink, formerly Stanley Fink, is revealed as having made the most of a four-year posting to Switzerland while working at hedge fund the Man Group. He opened Swiss accounts with HSBC in 1996 and 1997, which banked Man Group shares held in UK-registered bare trusts designed to minimise capital gains tax. Most of the trusts were wound up when he returned to London. Fink said they were fully declared and tax paid on all the dividends they received. \u201cI was Swiss-resident \u2026 the only reasons I opened bank accounts in Switzerland was the ordinary management of my current affairs. To the extent I created any trust accounts, these were perfectly normal planning matters, and could have been set up with similar effect, without the Swiss bank being involved.\u201d Edward Lee, who is on the board of Conservative Friends of Israel, has given some \u00a385,000 to the Tories. Lee and his brother were sons of the late Arnold Lee, a prominent London property developer, who set up offshore trusts for them in the 1970s. Their Swiss accounts had a value up to \u00a32m. Lee says all his tax affairs have been correctly declared and reported: \u201cI have paid all tax as and when due.\u201d Zac and Ben Goldsmith inherited French nationality and non-domicile status from their father Sir James Goldsmith. HSBC Suisse was used to distribute a tax sheltered offshore fortune to around 15 family members, and the money has since been invested by his heirs in UK properties and businesses. This perk ended for Zac Goldsmith in 2009, when he relinquished his non-dom status after a public outcry. He said he paid all taxes on income and capital gains, and that the offshore structure created by his father \u201cwas not designed to mitigate taxation but rather to preserve the assets for future generations\u201d. Ben Goldsmith declined to comment further. After publication of this story, Zac Goldsmith issued a statement which said: \u201cIt has never been a secret that I am a beneficiary of a trust set up by my late father and administered by a family office in Geneva. Indeed this was widely discussed before the last election. This report adds nothing to that old story. \u201cTo be clear, my very numerous family members around the world who are beneficiaries of the same trust do not own or control it, but like me, they receive income from it. \u201cI have never had a Swiss bank account, and do not control any Swiss bank accounts. I have never sought or been given tax minimisation advice by HSBC, directly or indirectly. The media commentary around this is therefore wrong.\u201d However, the leaked files contain details of a Caymans entity called Verton Holdings Ltd, listed by the bank as owned jointly by Zac and Ben Goldsmith. Verton invested in companies including Evergreen Investments and Ben Goldsmith\u2019s green private equity fund, WHEB Ventures. The Goldsmiths also used Verton to invest in the Sportsman, a short-lived newspaper which folded in 2006. Neither Goldsmith answered questions about Verton when approached by the Guardian ahead of publication. Those who claim non-domicile status, a quirk of British law which dates back to colonial times, must persuade tax inspectors that they intend to eventually leave the country for good. Sir Anwar Pervez, the founder of the Bestway cash and carry business, hedge fund investor Arpad Busson, and restaurant owner and clothing entrepreneur Richard Caring have all donated to British political parties, but under tax rules they must declare to the Revenue that they will be ending their days abroad. Pervez has donated, personally and through his company, over \u00a3500,000 to a range of parties, although the vast majority of his gifts have been to the Conservatives. HSBC\u2019s records indicate that Pervez and every other director on Bestway\u2019s eight-member board were linked with Swiss accounts. Pervez said the Revenue was aware of these accounts and trusts and all directors were tax compliant. Busson, a French national now based in London whose charity ARK manages over 30 academy schools, has given \u00a375,000 to the Tories via his company and held millions in an array of HSBC Swiss accounts. Busson said he had paid substantial UK tax. Lord Paul, who has given nearly \u00a3500,000 over a 25-year period to Labour, mostly via his UK companies, held a considerable portion of his fortune via Geneva, with accounts containing up to \u00a3240m. Paul relinquished his non-dom status in 2010, after parliamentarians were banned from using the benefit. He said the Revenue was fully aware of his accounts and that they had incurred no additional tax. Swiss client Caring, owner of London society venues the Ivy and Annabel\u2019s, loaned \u00a32m to Labour when the party was last in government, before publicly switching his support. He has now made donations worth over \u00a3400,000 to the Tories. As a non-dom born to an American father, Caring lives in the UK but has to say for tax purposes that he will not reside in the country indefinitely. Caring, who banked up to \u00a3100m in HSBC Suisse, said he had paid all due taxes on time. This article was amended on 11 February 2015 to better reflect Lord Fink\u2019s tax position.",

      "bodyText": "Lonmin shares have fallen after commodities trader Glencore said it would dispose of its stake in the troubled platinum miner. The move is part of Glencore\u2019s plan to cope with falling commodity prices, which also includes a cut in capital spending this year from $7.9bn to $6.5bn-$6.8bn. Glencore plans to distribute its Lonmin stake to its shareholders, rather than selling it. The stake came as part of Glencore\u2019s purchase of mining group Xstrata in 2013, and does not fit the company\u2019s strategy since it does not trade platinum.
