    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A new energy regulator under a Labour government would be given the power to revoke licences of any suppliers which repeatedly act against the interests of customers, the shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint will announce on Thursday. Under the plans, ministers would also expect the watchdog to publish an annual scorecard on company performances. The latest plans to shake up the market were released alongside figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act which apparently show that the current regulator, Ofgem, has levied 30 fines totalling more than \u00a387m on power companies since 2001 and has a further 16 probes into potential bad practice still under way. Flint, who has already promised to bring in a new watchdog and impose an energy price freeze until 2017 if Labour wins power next spring, will use a visit to the key seats of Reading East and Reading West to highlight new measures to halt industry abuses which she claims have proliferated under the coalition government. \"The public have a right to be treated fairly by energy companies. Where firms fail to meet these standards there must be tough and decisive action. Too often energy companies seem to view the regulator's fines as a cost of doing business \u2013 not as a warning to get their act together,\" she will say. \"Of course consumers must be compensated \u2013 but if energy companies persist in mistreating their customers they must know their licence could be on the line.\" Ofgem has the power to revoke licences in certain circumstances including where companies have failed to comply with enforcement orders, but the slate is wiped clean as long as fines are paid. Under Labour's proposal, which the party hopes will send a clear message to the industry, the regulator would be beefed up and repeat offenders would be threatened with losing their licences. Action by Labour against soaring energy bills is part of a wider strategy to highlight what it claims is a cost-of-living crisis that undermines Conservative boasts to have mended the economy. Flint expects to ratchet up the pressure on ministers by releasing figures which Labour says show household energy bills have risen twice as fast as inflation and four times as fast as wages since 2010. The analysis, based on numbers obtained from the Department of Energy and Climate Change, is said to show that domestic electricity prices \u2013 including taxes \u2013 rose faster than in any other EU country apart from Ireland. Flint said: \"At the next election there will be a real choice between another five years of rocketing energy bills, rip-off tactics and poor customer service under the Tories \u2013 or Labour's plans to freeze energy bills until 2017, saving the average household \u00a3120, and reform the energy market for the future.\" The Tories said the government had been working hard for consumers by rolling back green levies, forcing companies to simplify bills and overseeing a Competition and Markets Authority investigation into the \"broken market\" inherited from Labour. The party also insisted that average combined energy bills went up by 80% to \u00a3503 under the last Labour government while the number of suppliers operating in the market fell from 15 in 2000 to six when it left office. \"We'll take no lectures from the party that brought Britain's economy to its knees. Labour left our country with a broken energy market and huge taxes on bills \u2013 meaning the number of people in fuel poverty nearly doubled in Labour's last five years,\" said a Tory spokesman. The Institute of Directors business group claimed that \"aggressive\" attacks on the energy companies risked chasing away much-needed investment in Britain's energy sector. \"There is a real danger that the money needed to renew our generating capacity will dry up, shortages will appear, prices will rise much higher, and ultimately it will be the customers who suffer,\" said Dan Lewis, a senior energy policy adviser at the institute. Ofgem disputed the figures, saying it had handed out \u00a360.7m in fines since 2001 and imposed \u00a358.5m in customer redress payments. A spokesperson said Ofgem has \"powers to revoke licences in certain specific circumstances including where companies have failed to comply with particular enforcement orders we have set requiring them to change or stop behaviours.\"",

    "webTitle": "Self-employment in UK at highest level since records began", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's deepest postwar recession has led to record numbers of self-employed people, who are earning lower wages and working longer hours than other workers, a study suggests. Self-employment in the UK is at its highest level since records began almost 40 years ago, according to a report by the Office for National Statistics, with taxi-driving, construction and carpentry among the most common jobs. There are 4.6 million people working for themselves, with the proportion of the total workforce self-employed at 15% compared with 13% in 2008, and 8.7% in 1975. Fewer people left self-employment over the last five years than at any period in the last 20 years, with the ONS suggesting that they might have struggled to find an alternative job during the downturn. It also pointed to the increasing number of people choosing to work for themselves beyond the state pension age of 65. The ONS said more people than usual staying in self-employment was the main reason behind the sharp rise in numbers over recent years, which itself has accounted for the majority of the overall rise in employment since early 2008. \"The rise in self-employment can be accounted for by fewer people leaving self-employment than in the past. About 886,000 people who were self-employed in 2009 had left by 2014, compared with 1.3 million who were self-employed in 2004 leaving by 2009,\" the ONS said. Of the 1.1 million increase in the total number of workers in the UK between the first quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2014, 732,000, or just over two-thirds, were self-employed. A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"[The] figures show the rise is mainly due to fewer people leaving self-employment than in the past and self-employment in the UK is still below the EU average. And in fact many people aspire to be their own boss and self-employment has been a growing part of the labour market for most of the last 30 years.\" The number of self-employed people over 65 has more than doubled in the past five years to reach almost half a million. Self-employed people tend to be older, with an average age of 47, compared with an average of 40 among employees. Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \"It's great that older people are using self-employment to stay working and earning as they approach and even pass their state pension age, even if many are doing this because they can't afford to retire. But it's worrying that much of the recent increase is due, as the ONS says, to the limited opportunities for people to move out of self-employment.\" Self-employed people have on average experienced a 22% fall in real pay since 2008-09, according to the ONS. O'Grady said Britain's self-employed had been the hardest hit by the prolonged pay squeeze, with average earnings of \u00a3207 a week \u2013 less than half that of employees \u2013 and with no sick or holiday pay, and no employer to contribute towards their pension. She said: \"Self-employment appears to be a key factor in the UK economy's shift towards low-paid work. Many people want to work for themselves. But the growth in self-employment is reducing people's pay, job security and retirement income \u2013 and is likely to be reducing the government's tax take, too.\" Laura Gardiner, a senior analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"Figures from the ONS today confirm many of the findings from our own study of the growth in self-employment, including the fact the self-employed have seen a sharper fall in earnings than employees in recent years.\"Chuka Umunna, Labour's shadow business secretary, said more support for the self-employed and a better understanding of their contribution was needed. As well as being paid less, Britain's self-employed are also more likely to work longer hours, according to the ONS. In 2014 the average hours worked by the self-employed was 40 hours, two more than employees. About 13% of self-employed workers usually worked 60 hours or more, compared with 4% of employees. People are most likely to be self-employed in London (17.3%), followed by the south-west (16.6%). The areas with the lowest proportion are the north-east (10.8%), followed by Scotland at 11.5%. At 15%, the proportion of self-employed in the UK is roughly in line with the EU average of 15.2%. Greece had the highest, at 32%, which is attributed to its large agricultural sector and tourism. The lowest rates in 2014 were in Luxembourg, at 8.1%, and Denmark, at 9%.",

But the growth in self-employment is reducing people's pay, job security and retirement income \u2013 and is likely to be reducing the government's tax take, too.\"</p> <p>Laura Gardiner, a senior analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"Figures from the ONS today confirm many of the findings from our own study of the growth in self-employment, including the fact the self-employed have seen a sharper fall in earnings than employees in recent years.\"Chuka Umunna, Labour's shadow business secretary, said more support for the self-employed and a better understanding of their contribution was needed.</p> <p>As well as being paid less, Britain's self-employed are also more likely to work longer hours, according to the ONS. In 2014 the average hours worked by the self-employed was 40 hours, two more than employees. About 13% of self-employed workers usually worked 60 hours or more, compared with 4% of employees.</p> <p>People are most likely to be self-employed in London (17.3%), followed by the south-west (16.6%). The areas with the lowest proportion are the north-east (10.8%), followed by Scotland at 11.5%.</p> <p>At 15%, the proportion of self-employed in the UK is roughly in line with the EU average of 15.2%. Greece had the highest, at 32%, which is attributed to its large agricultural sector and tourism. The lowest rates in 2014 were in Luxembourg, at 8.1%, and Denmark, at 9%.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel has delivered a sharp rebuke to Italy and France for hindering the eurozone's recovery by breaking longstanding fiscal rules. The German chancellor, under pressure following a fall in GDP in the second quarter, said faltering growth was the direct result of the 18-member currency zone's inability to punish those countries that ran high deficits in contravention of limits set by Brussels. She said Germany had shown it was possible to cut the government's annual spending deficit while at the same time improve the economic situation. Speaking to an audience of Nobel prize-winning economists in the Bavarian town of Lindau, she said individual countries had ignored Brussels and the European Central Bank (ECB) to continue running larger deficits than allowed by the fiscal rules. \"We have very little, if any, possibility of sanctioning those countries that break the rules,\" she said. Her comments echoed those of ECB president Mario Draghi, who last month warned that without moves to strengthen the fiscal pact and impose punishments on rule-breaking countries, the eurozone project could flounder. The two speeches highlight the growing frustration among senior eurozone policymakers at the failure of France and Italy to meet the 3% deficit target set by Brussels with Germany's support. The eurozone economy stalled in the last quarter following poor output figures from France and Italy and a slowdown in Germany, much of it blamed on a drop in demand for German goods from its largest neighbours and the Ukraine crisis. However, critics of Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, argue that Germany is the source of the currency zone's problems following its pursuit of balanced budgets while harder-hit countries have yet to rebuild their banking sectors and bolster consumer confidence. Germany's persistent trade surplus with other EU countries is also blamed for undermining the recovery among the other 17 members, which import German goods but struggle to sell inside the EU's largest economy. Nobel economics laureate Joseph Stiglitz criticised the chancellor on the sidelines of the conference for imposing policies that have led to high unemployment and slow growth. Merkel has resisted Stiglitz's calls for a Keynesian spur to recovery, including pooling debts in commonly-issued \"Eurobonds\" to allow members of the currency to borrow money at lower interest rates. \"We see the enormous price that Europe is paying,\" the former World Bank chief economist told Bloomberg Television. \"Hopefully the reality of this failed policy will strike.\" Merkel told Stiglitz and other Nobel laureates that monetary union needed to be married to fiscal union, which would provide the confidence and discipline for stained growth.

    "webTitle": "SNP accused of exaggerating North Sea oil reserves by up to 60%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Ian Wood, the most influential figure in the Scottish oil industry, has accused Alex Salmond's government of exaggerating North Sea oil reserves by up to 60%. Wood, the billionaire founder of the oil services firm Wood Group, said the first minister's administration had also overestimated North Sea oil income over the next five years by up to \u00a32bn a year or \u00a3370 per person, raising serious questions about Salmond's public spending plans. Revealing himself as an opponent of Scottish independence, Wood said North Sea oil reserves would begin to decline sharply within 15 years, raising questions about the future of the Scottish economy, jobs and its balance of payments if voters backed independence. In a wide-ranging interview with the industry website energyvoice.com, Wood also said an independent Scotland would likely lose the UK's heavy subsidy of the new windfarms and marine energy plants it needed to hit Salmond's target of generating 100% of the country's electricity from renewable sources by 2020. That raised questions for younger Scottish voters in September's referendum, he said, as Salmond has repeatedly predicted there were up to 24bn barrels of oil equivalent (bboe) still to be extracted \u2013 at the top end of estimates used by the industry body Oil and Gas UK. Based on that 24bboe figure, Salmond and the Yes Scotland independence campaign have repeatedly cited the potential value of Scotland's oil reserves as \u00a31.5tn, a figure dismissed as fanciful by the Treasury and other economists. Wood said he believed the \"best outcome\" would be 15 to 16.5bboe left to extract. That is in the mid range of Scottish government predictions, leaving Scotland dependent on shale oil and gas imports from England from 2030 onwards. \"The offshore oil and gas industry cannot figure significantly in Scotland's medium-term economic calculations,\" Wood said. \"Young voters in the referendum will only be in their 40s when they will see the significant rundown in the Scottish offshore oil and gas sector, and the serious implications for our economy, jobs and public services.\" Although other economists have backed Salmond's predictions about the strength of Scotland's economy under independence, including Sir Donald Mackay, a former chairman of Scottish Enterprise, Wood's intervention is a blow to Salmond. One of Scotland's most respected industrialists, Wood was the author of a major UK government-commissioned study into maximising North Sea production earlier this year, which was lauded by Salmond. He also chaired an employment commission for the first minister. Wood is also a dominant figure in Aberdeen, the centre of the UK's oil industry, where he offered to donate up to \u00a375m for a public park redevelopment in the city centre, which was heavily backed by Salmond's Scottish National party. Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor and head of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, said Wood's analysis \"fatally undermines\" Salmond's oil predictions and \"blow apart Alex Salmond's plans for funding schools and hospitals.\" Darling added that it was \"devastating for his ridiculous claims on pensions and on jobs\". Fergus Ewing, the Scottish energy minister, said Wood's predictions were more generous than those of the UK government's Office for Budget Responsibility, but Scotland was wealthy enough to live without huge oil revenues.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Ian Wood, the most influential figure in the Scottish oil industry, has accused Alex Salmond's government of exaggerating North Sea oil reserves by up to 60%.</p> <p>Wood, the billionaire founder of the oil services firm Wood Group, said the first minister's administration had also overestimated North Sea oil income over the next five years by up to \u00a32bn a year or \u00a3370 per person, raising serious questions about Salmond's public spending plans.</p> <p>Revealing himself as an opponent of Scottish independence, Wood said North Sea oil reserves would begin to decline sharply within 15 years, raising questions about the future of the Scottish economy, jobs and its balance of payments if voters backed independence.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview with the industry website <a href=\"http://www.energyvoice.com/\" title=\"\">energyvoice.com</a>, Wood also said an independent Scotland would likely lose the UK's heavy subsidy of the new windfarms and marine energy plants it needed to hit Salmond's target of generating 100% of the country's electricity from renewable sources by 2020.</p> <p>That raised questions for younger Scottish voters in September's referendum, he said, as Salmond has repeatedly predicted there were up to 24bn barrels of oil equivalent (bboe) still to be extracted \u2013 at the top end of estimates used by the industry body Oil and Gas UK.</p> <p>Based on that 24bboe figure, Salmond and the Yes Scotland independence campaign have repeatedly cited the potential value of Scotland's oil reserves as \u00a31.5tn, a figure dismissed as fanciful by the Treasury and other economists.</p> <p>Wood said he believed the \"best outcome\" would be 15 to 16.5bboe left to extract. That is in the mid range of Scottish government predictions, leaving Scotland dependent on shale oil and gas imports from England from 2030 onwards. \"The offshore oil and gas industry cannot figure significantly in Scotland's medium-term economic calculations,\" Wood said.</p> <p>\"Young voters in the referendum will only be in their 40s when they will see the significant rundown in the Scottish offshore oil and gas sector, and the serious implications for our economy, jobs and public services.\"</p> <p>Although other economists have backed Salmond's predictions about the strength of Scotland's economy under independence, including Sir Donald Mackay, a former chairman of Scottish Enterprise, Wood's intervention is a blow to Salmond.</p> <p>One of Scotland's most respected industrialists, Wood was the author of a major UK government-commissioned study into maximising North Sea production earlier this year, which was lauded by Salmond. He also chaired an employment commission for the first minister.</p> <p>Wood is also a dominant figure in Aberdeen, the centre of the UK's oil industry, where he offered to donate up to \u00a375m for a public park redevelopment in the city centre, which was heavily backed by Salmond's Scottish National party.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, the former Labour chancellor and head of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, said Wood's analysis \"fatally undermines\" Salmond's oil predictions and \"blow apart Alex Salmond's plans for funding schools and hospitals.\"</p> <p>Darling added that it was \"devastating for his ridiculous claims on pensions and on jobs\".</p> <p>Fergus Ewing, the Scottish energy minister, said Wood's predictions were more generous than those of the UK government's Office for Budget Responsibility, but Scotland was wealthy enough to live without huge oil revenues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Construction firm Carillion has abandoned its bid to merge with Balfour Beatty, after its larger rival spurned its third offer. As the clock ticked down to the deadline of 5pm on Thursday for Carillion to lodge a formal bid or walk away, the FTSE 250 listed company announced it was no longer pursuing a merger with Balfour Beatty. The decision was almost inevitable after Balfour Beatty rejected a sweetened offer from Carillion on Wednesday morning, barring the way to further talks. Carillion was not expected to make a hostile takeover. The board \"has unanimously concluded that the proposal is not in the best interests of its shareholders\", Balfour Beatty said, stressing it would not seek an extension to Thursday's put up or shut up deadline, as Carillion had requested. Carillion had pressed for talks to continue, as it increased its offer that would give Balfour's shareholders 58.3% of the combined group \u2013 a 3% improvement on its previous proposal. Under UK takeover rules, Carillion will not be able to make another approach until February 2015. In a statement, Carillion said it reserved the right to make a future offer for Balfour \"at any price\", in compliance with the takeover code. Carillion has argued that the tie-up to create a construction group employing 80,000 workers has a \"powerful strategic logic\" allowing the combined company to make savings of \u00a3175m a year by 2016. Balfour Beatty, the UK's largest construction firm and builder of the Aquatics Centre at London's Olympic Park, rejected the renewed offer for the same reasons it had spurned previous approaches. It reiterated its desire to sell Parsons Brinckerhoff, the US design and consultancy business Carillion wanted to keep in a combined company. Balfour also deems the merger too risky and voiced unhappiness with a business plan that it said would mean a significant reduction in \"the scale of the UK construction business when it is poised to benefit from a recovery in the market\". While housebuilding has been booming over the last year, the large-scale engineering and construction projects that are Balfour Beatty's stock and trade typically lag 18 months behind an economic recovery. Steve Marshall, executive chair of Balfour Beatty, said earlier this month that the firm was already witnessing a recovery and predicted further improvement over the next three to four years. Alastair Stewart, an analyst at Westhouse Securities, advised investors to sell Balfour Beatty stock. He warned that the construction business faced \"considerable risks\", while Balfour Beatty's effort in fending off Carillion and selling Parsons Brinckerhoff, may have meant that the firm's management had \"taken its eye off the ball\" from the intensive action needed on UK construction contracts. Balfour Beatty, which has issued four profit warnings in two years, has been struggling with the downturn in the UK construction business since the onset of the recession. In May, the company cut \u00a330m off profit forecasts for its UK construction business, as it announced that chief executive Andrew McNaughton was leaving. With no successor in place, several analysts have questioned Balfour's decision to offload its US business, which is seen as a more reliable source of income than the volatile construction trade. Stewart said Parsons Brinckerhoff was the \"crown jewel [that] should have been central to its strategy\" and that it was being sold with \"undue haste\".",

Thus in the near term one would expect inflation to start picking up. This will occur as the labour market tightens so that workers can start to bargain for higher wages.</p> <p>\u201cThis all points to inflation rising and an early initial rate rise. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/aug/19/inflation-what-does-it-mean-for-you\">And yet this month\u2019s inflation figure is down</a>. This could suggest that the economic picture is worse than the above analysis suggests.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the ONS highlights other reasons for the month\u2019s figure: the late timing of the summer sales due to good weather mean clothes prices were unusually high in June this year and so the fall to July more pronounced than usual; the strengthening march of Aldi and Lidl, the supermarket discounters, has begun a retail price war lowering prices; the low ebb of the Eurozone has made sterling appreciate so that imported goods appear cheaper when priced in pounds.</p> <p>\u201cIf these reasons are correct then the low inflation figure is likely to be an aberration as the sales and price war effects run their course. One would expect UK economic growth to continue in September and wage growth to follow in due course. </p> <p>Which of these competing explanations applies is unclear.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Oh, the perils of economic forecasting....</em></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T14:14:10.166Z\">at 3.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-53f4a4fce4b092330feea197\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T13:52:15.748Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In other news, Argentina\u2019s plan to issue new local-law bonds to its creditors to resolve its default conundrum hasn\u2019t been well received in the markets (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f45180e4b092330feea123\">see 8.59am for details</a>).</p> <p>The value of some Argentinian government bonds has fallen, suggesting investors see them as even riskier today.<br></p> <p>Analysts are warning that the plan could leave creditors more exposed to the whims of the Argentinian government; even though, at present, they can\u2019t be repaid at all, because a US judge has sided with vulture funds who demand full repayment on bonds which were defaulted on in 2001.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanCancel/statuses/502082082458591232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Jefferies: \u201cExecution risk should be high and initial participation quite low.&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Argentina?src=hash\">#Argentina</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Cancel (@DanCancel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanCancel/statuses/502082082458591232\">August 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanCancel/statuses/502081790807658497\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>JPMorgan: \u201cIt&#39;s also a poor option because restructured bondholders have to be willing to accept local custodian and capital control risk.\u201d</p>&mdash; Daniel Cancel (@DanCancel) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanCancel/statuses/502081790807658497\">August 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-53f49b7ae4b0ab8524dca283\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-08-20T13:16:45.616Z\">2.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Larry Elliott: Bank is truffling through the data</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-11eee477-0818-4caf-afab-bfce5cf3d27a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408540474531/19f82151-7659-4373-8400-8a660dca249d-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"Businessmen check their phones in the City of London on August 19, 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Businessmen checking their phones in the City of London.Photograph: CARL COURT/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f45c05e4b0ab8524dca241\">Away from the drama of the 7-2 vote</a>, today\u2019s minutes show that the Monetary Policy Committee is scrutinising every piece of economic data that comes their way.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/minutes/Documents/mpc/pdf/2014/mpc1408.pdf\">\u201cImmediate Policy Decision\u201d</a> outlined the wide range of views about the amount of spare capacity remaining in the economy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f46096e4b0ab8524dca248\">As outlined earlier</a>, a majority of policymakers saw little inflationary risk \u2013 especially with wage growth still weak (<em>much to t<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f48d7ce4b0ab8524dca27d\">he IoD\u2019s chagrin</a></em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2014/aug/20/bank-of-england-minutes-to-shed-light-on-interest-rate-rises-business-live#block-53f48d7ce4b0ab8524dca27d\">)</a>.</p> <p><strong>Economics editor Larry Elliott </strong>reckons these seven MPC members they won\u2019t be swayed anytime soon:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There has been nothing in the recent data to make any of the seven MPC members voting to keep rates on hold change their minds.

This is the first time there wasn\u2019t a unanimous decision in just over three years. The committee voted 9-0 in favour of leaving QE at \u00a3375bn.</p> <p>The two dissenters argued that \u201cthe degree of spare capacity had diminished sufficiently\u201d and that a tightening labour market \u201ccreated a prospect that wage growth would pick up\u201d. They also noted that wages were a lagging indicator and \u201cit was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank Rate in advance of them\u201d. Even after a 25bp rate rise they argued that \u201cmonetary policy would remain extremely supportive\u201d. It would also help facilitate the MPCs \u201caspiration that the rises in Bank Rate should only be gradual\u201d.<br></p> <p>However, the majority still need a fair bit of convincing. The minutes stated that \u201cfor most members, there remained insufficient evidence of inflationary pressures to justify an immediate increase in Bank Rate\u201d. They felt that the rate of growth would moderate while inflation was expected to \u201creach the 2% target only at the end of the three-year forecast period\u201d. They also cited weak wages and the possibility labour market slack may have been greater than previously thought. By delaying rate hikes it would \u201callow the expansion to become more entrenched\u201d.

Details in Nick Fletcher\u2019s closing market report. European markets also paused for breath but ahead of the release of the US Federal Reserve\u2019s latest minutes, Wall Street has moved higher. The closing scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished 23.83 points or 0.35% lower at 6755.48 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.21% to 9314.57 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.32% at 4240.79 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended 0.2% lower at 19,605.97 Spain\u2019s Ibex slipped 0.33% to 10,420.9 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 29 points or 0.17%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow. That\u2019s probably all that we (or anyone else!) has to say about the Bank of England\u2019s minutes right now. For full coverage and reaction, scroll back to 9.30am. Or check out Larry\u2019s news story: Bank of England split on interest rates reopens prospect of a rise in 2014 His comment: Interest rate rise is coming \u2013 but data must be strong enough for all on MPC And our round-up of expert reaction is here: Bank of England split on interest rates \u2013 what the economists say The split at the heart of the Bank of England highlights how hard it is to interpret the state of the UK economy, argues Professor John Thanassoulis of Warwick Business School. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s Minutes: The economy is recovering as GDP has been growing; house prices have been rising and unemployment has been falling. Thus in the near term one would expect inflation to start picking up. This will occur as the labour market tightens so that workers can start to bargain for higher wages. \u201cThis all points to inflation rising and an early initial rate rise. And yet this month\u2019s inflation figure is down. This could suggest that the economic picture is worse than the above analysis suggests. \u201cHowever, the ONS highlights other reasons for the month\u2019s figure: the late timing of the summer sales due to good weather mean clothes prices were unusually high in June this year and so the fall to July more pronounced than usual; the strengthening march of Aldi and Lidl, the supermarket discounters, has begun a retail price war lowering prices; the low ebb of the Eurozone has made sterling appreciate so that imported goods appear cheaper when priced in pounds. \u201cIf these reasons are correct then the low inflation figure is likely to be an aberration as the sales and price war effects run their course. One would expect UK economic growth to continue in September and wage growth to follow in due course. Which of these competing explanations applies is unclear.\u201d Oh, the perils of economic forecasting.... In other news, Argentina\u2019s plan to issue new local-law bonds to its creditors to resolve its default conundrum hasn\u2019t been well received in the markets (see 8.59am for details). The value of some Argentinian government bonds has fallen, suggesting investors see them as even riskier today. Analysts are warning that the plan could leave creditors more exposed to the whims of the Argentinian government; even though, at present, they can\u2019t be repaid at all, because a US judge has sided with vulture funds who demand full repayment on bonds which were defaulted on in 2001. Away from the drama of the 7-2 vote, today\u2019s minutes show that the Monetary Policy Committee is scrutinising every piece of economic data that comes their way. The \u201cImmediate Policy Decision\u201d outlined the wide range of views about the amount of spare capacity remaining in the economy. As outlined earlier, a majority of policymakers saw little inflationary risk \u2013 especially with wage growth still weak (much to the IoD\u2019s chagrin). Economics editor Larry Elliott reckons these seven MPC members they won\u2019t be swayed anytime soon: There has been nothing in the recent data to make any of the seven MPC members voting to keep rates on hold change their minds. Indeed, since the August meeting official figures have shown inflation falling to 1.6% and earnings growth dipping to 0.6%. The international outlook has darkened, with activity in the eurozone coming to a halt in the second quarter and tension mounting in the Ukraine. What\u2019s more, the message that the Bank is moving closer to a rate rise may make it harder to raise borrowing costs. Consumers may start to spend less in anticipation of their mortgage costs rising, while a stronger pound will make imports cheaper and thus bear down on inflation. The MPC is now operating on a month-by-month basis, with members truffling through each and every piece of new data for clues as to what is happening to the economy. Rates will only rise if the incoming data is strong enough to make three other members of the MPC join Weale and McCafferty. As things stand, it is hard to see that happening. Analysis: Interest rate rise is coming \u2013 but data must be strong enough for all on MPC The Institute of Directors, which represents Britain\u2019s bosses, is delighted to see two hawks emerge at the Bank of England. The IoD suggested that the seven MPC members who voted for no-change are wrong to focus their attention on weak wage growth (!), and should crack on with raising rates -- ideally before Christmas James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, says: Looking ahead over the next two years, as the economy continues to expand, the Bank of England will need to normalise interest rates. The IoD has called for rate rises to begin this year, aiming to reach a level of around 3% by the end of next year. The majority of MPC members still favour the status quo, but the minutes released today show that opinion in favour of rate rises has gained a foothold in the Committee. \u201cThe MPC argues that they are awaiting strong growth in wages before acting. However, we believe that monetary policy must be put back on a more normal footing first, before we begin to monitor inflation and other factors to see if further action is needed. Our research shows that wage rises are on the way, but they will be tied to improved corporate performance and therefore should not be the Bank\u2019s primary focus when deciding when to end this period of extraordinary monetary policy.\u201d There\u2019s a clear split over interest rate policy among British business. As flagged up at 11.50am, the British Chambers of Commerce believes the UK economy isn\u2019t strong enough to support higher interest rates. And should Britain\u2019s business leaders (who are rarely short of a bob or two) really be arguing that workers shouldn\u2019t have the protection of higher wages before being hit with a rate hike? Professor Danny Blanchflower, a former (dovish) member of the MPC, reckons the two hawks have blundered. Data released since August\u2019s rate decision suggests no-change was the right call, he argues. Jonathan Pryor, head of FX dealing at Investec Corporate and Institutional Treasury, says the 7-2 split is a surprise, given how dovish the Bank\u2019s Inflation Report was last week. \u201cThis vote is likely to leave UK businesses scratching their heads about the direction of sterling and the best way to guard against potential volatility over the coming weeks and months.\u201d UK interest rates are now more likely to rise before the next general election than not, according to Ladbrokes\u2019 latest odds. Ladbrokes has cut the odds on the first rate hike coming before May 2015, having seen the minutes of this month\u2019s MPC meeting. Spokesman Alex Donohue explains: \u201cToday\u2019s MPC minutes have shaken up our rate market significantly. The latest news from Threadneedle Street now points to a pre-election rise being the most likely outcome.\u201d Interest rates to rise before the general election Yes: 8/11 No: evens How many members of the MPC will vote in favour of a rise in September\u2019s meeting? 0-1: 6/4 2: 6/4 3 or more: 5/2 We\u2019re running a poll, asking when readers think the first UK interest rate rise will come: Poll: when will UK interest rates rise? The British Chambers of Commerce has criticised Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty for voting to raise interest rates at this month\u2019s MPC meeting. David Kern, the BCC\u2019s chief economist, says the split vote is a \u201cdisappointing shift of opinion\u201d. He argues that the UK economy is not strong enough to support higher borrowing costs, especially as inflation is still low. Kern says: \u201cWhile the large majority of committee members still believe in the existing policy of keeping interest rates low, it is disappointing that two members voted for an immediate increase at the last MPC meeting. With inflation well below target and wage growth stagnating, any increase in interest rates at the moment would be premature. The economic recovery is still not secure and growth amongst UK businesses must be fostered in a low interest rate environment. The risks from raising rates too early are much greater than the risks of waiting just a little longer.\u201d Today\u2019s minutes (online here), show that a majority of the MPC share Kern\u2019s concerns. And Peter Hemington, partner at accountancy firm BDO, is worried that the sight of a disunited Bank of England may deter UK firms from investing. Hemington warned: \u201cThere are still big question marks for businesses on when the rise might come. Businesses cannot plan for growth on the basis of vague or conflicting statements - policy makers can do more to provide certainty for businesses, enabling them to make informed decisions for the future.\u201d While eurozone builders struggle, UK manufacturers remain upbeat about their prospects. The CBI\u2019s monthly survey of the sector found that 37% of firms had boosted their output over the last quarter, while 25% said it had fallen. Nine sectors reported that the pace of growth had slowed in the past three months, but sixteen sectors anticipate growth over the coming quarter. There are also signs that order books have strengthened this month, after a dip in July. We also have another slice of worrying economic news from the eurozone to digest. Construction output across the euro area fell by 0.7% in June, for the second month running, adding to May\u2019s 1.4% decline. Statistics body Eurostat reported that building and civil engineering activity both declined in June, suggesting broad-based weakness \u2013 at a time when the eurozone is already stagnating. Looking for a full round-up of economist reaction to this morning\u2019s Bank of England minutes? Your search is over.... Bank of England split on interest rates \u2013 what the economists say Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s Bank minutes, by economics editor Larry Elliott: Bank of England split on interest rates reopens prospect of a rise in 2014 The first increase in interest rates from the Bank of England since 2007 has moved a decisive step closer after two members of Threadneedle Street\u2019s key policy committee broke ranks and voted for dearer borrowing. Minutes of the meeting of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting show that two of the nine members \u2013 Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty \u2013 called for rates to be pushed up by a quarter point to 0.75%. Although the other seven members of the MPC said weak earnings growth, below-target inflation, and the fragile finances of some households warranted keeping rates unchanged, the August meeting was the first time since 2011 that the MPC has not voted unanimously on rates..... (more here) The emergence of two hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee makes a rate rise in 2014 a little more likely, says Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg bank. He cites three caveats, however. (1) Dissenters do not always signal an imminent majority shift: there was a run of dissenting votes in 2011 as well, but the majority of the MPC stuck to the dovish course then. (2) Wage growth has slowed even more according to data releases since the meeting, with weekly earnings falling by 0.2% yoy in June. (3) Geo-political risks have increased and affect the UK\u2019s largest trading partner, the Eurozone. In our view, the probability for a first rate hike remains finely balanced, but the majority is likely to hold-out until February next year. That would still be a bit before current market expectations. The City is now pricing in the first UK rate rise in January 2015, compared with February 2015 yesterday, Reuters reports: STERLING OVERNIGHT INTERBANK AVERAGE RATE SHOWS CHANCE OF BOE RATE HIKE IN 5 MONTHS, VS 6 MONTHS ON TUESDAY Alastair Winter, chief economist at investment bank Daniel Stewart, points out that the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates at a \u2018gradual\u2019 pace. \u201cSo, change is in the air after all! Over the last two months I have become increasingly convinced that it was merely a matter of months before the first rate hike came. The gap between the majority on the MPC and the so-called hawks has been and still is narrow. Martin Weale was already a suspect and now Ian McCafferty has \u2018come out\u2019. James Knightley of ING has produced a very handy summary of today\u2019s Bank of England minutes: The minutes to the August Bank of England monetary policy meeting showed that the committee voted 7-2 in favour of keeping Bank Rate at 0.5% with Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty both voting for a 25bp interest rate rise. This is the first time there wasn\u2019t a unanimous decision in just over three years. The committee voted 9-0 in favour of leaving QE at \u00a3375bn. The two dissenters argued that \u201cthe degree of spare capacity had diminished sufficiently\u201d and that a tightening labour market \u201ccreated a prospect that wage growth would pick up\u201d. They also noted that wages were a lagging indicator and \u201cit was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank Rate in advance of them\u201d. Even after a 25bp rate rise they argued that \u201cmonetary policy would remain extremely supportive\u201d. It would also help facilitate the MPCs \u201caspiration that the rises in Bank Rate should only be gradual\u201d. However, the majority still need a fair bit of convincing. The minutes stated that \u201cfor most members, there remained insufficient evidence of inflationary pressures to justify an immediate increase in Bank Rate\u201d. They felt that the rate of growth would moderate while inflation was expected to \u201creach the 2% target only at the end of the three-year forecast period\u201d. They also cited weak wages and the possibility labour market slack may have been greater than previously thought. By delaying rate hikes it would \u201callow the expansion to become more entrenched\u201d. Indeed, raising rates too early in the absence of wage rises could increase \u201cthe vulnerability of highly indebted households\u201d, while also adding to upward pressure on sterling. Knightley reckons, though, that Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty will remain in the minority for a while yet. Yesterday\u2019s low inflation numbers, the lack of wage growth and concerns about Eurozone growth \u2013 the UK\u2019s largest trade partner, suggest that in the absence of upside activity data shocks the majority will continue to opt for the status quo in the next few months. Indeed, it currently looks more likely to be February when we see the first rate rise than our current published forecast of November. This isn\u2019t the first time that Martin Weale has called, in vain, for a rate rise. Back in 2011, he voted for a quarter-point rise, but subsequently changed his mind as the world economy was rocked by the eurozone crisis. Alex Edwards, head of the corporate desk at UKForex, says the latest Bank minutes \u201csend a confusing message to investors, households and business owners as to when to expect the next rate rise\u201d. Yesterday\u2019s inflation figures indicate that this could happen next year, but these minutes might suggest it could be before the New Year.\u201d We should remember that this Monetary Policy Committee meeting took place before the latest inflation data, which showed a surprise fall in the consumer prices index to 1.6% in July, from 1.9% in June. That drop in inflation bolsters the case for leaving interest rates unchanged for longer, and may have surprised the MPC. So, who might be next to join McCafferty and Weale in voting for a rate rise? Jeremy Cook of World First suggests it could be chief economist Andy Haldane, or even deputy governor Ben Broadbent. Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty were outvoted because other Bank of England policymakers believe there is \u201cinsufficient evidence of inflationary pressures\u201d to justify a rate rise. They want to leave interest rates at their record low of 0.5% until there are clear signs that wages are rising. The minutes say: Given the risk that an increase in labour supply or persistent concerns over job security would result in weak wage growth continuing for longer, there would be merit in waiting to see firmer evidence that solid increases in pay growth were in prospect before tightening policy. The latest data showed that average earnings, excluding bonuses, are growing at just 0.6% per year. Inflation is currently 1.6%, meaning real wages are shrinking by 1%. The minutes show that Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale both argued that the UK economy was strong enough to justify an immediate rise in bank rate. They believe that earnings across the UK economy are likely to pick up in the months ahead, meaning the Bank of England should start to tighten monetary policy now. Here\u2019s the key section from the Minutes: For two members, in particular, economic circumstances were sufficient to justify an immediate rise in Bank Rate. These members noted that the continuing rapid fall in unemployment alongside survey evidence of tightening in the labour market created a prospect that wage growth would pick up. They noted that it was possible that wages were lagging developments in the labour market to some extent. If that were true, wages might not start to rise until spare capacity in the labour market were fully used up. Since monetary policy, too, could be expected to operate only with a lag, it was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank Rate in advance of them. Weale and McCafferty also argued that there was no guarantee that the risks of a negative financial market reaction would be lessened by holding rates down for longer. They could even be \u201caugmented\u201d, they warned. The Bank minutes are online here. This is the first time that Britain\u2019s monetary policy has been split over interest rates since 2011 (rates have been unchanged at 0.5% since March 2009). The Minutes explains that Mark Carney invited the MPC to vote on the proposition that Bank Rate should be maintained at 0.5%, and that it should leave its quantitative easing bond-buying programme unchanged at \u00a3375 billion. Six members backed the governor, but two dissented. Regarding Bank Rate, seven members of the Committee (the Governor, Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe, Nemat Shafik, Kristin Forbes, Andrew Haldane and David Miles) voted in favour of the proposition. Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale voted against the proposition, preferring to increase Bank Rate by 25 basis points. The pound has jumped half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.6665. Breaking: The Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee was split over interest rates! Two members, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, broke with consensus and voted to raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points, to 0.75%, at the meeting earlier this month. Martin Weale, one of the external members of the MPC, is seen as the most likely hawk to vote to raise rates.... Just five minutes until the Bank of England minutes are released..... Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services explains what to watch for: Dissent cannot be ruled out within the MPC minutes, even if the consensus looks for 9-0, though that consensus appears to favour Martin Weale as the dissenter, despite the prior evidence, which suggests that Weale can appear voice hawkish opinions, but \u201ctalking the talk does not translate (de facto) into walking the walk\u201d. Be that as it may, the focus will be on the background debate to last week\u2019s Inflation Report, which will inevitably highlight that MPC views on the economy remains very divergent. Of more interest perhaps, will be the discussion on market rate trajectories and indeed MPC guidance, even if MPC opinions will hardly have been unitary. But perhaps most attention (as ever) should be devoted to the MPC Agents\u2019 reports, as signals from non-construction related sectors have been decidedly mixed, and even construction appears to be hitting supply related buffers, be that in terms of labour skills or raw materials constraints. European stock markets have dipped in early trading, with Carlsberg\u2019s profit warning not helping sentiment. The German, French and UK indices are down between 0.2% and 0.3%. The euro has hit a new 11-month low against the US dollar this morning, down 0.2% to $1.3295. It weakened after a survey of Dutch consumer confidence fell to minus 6, from minus 2 in July. The Ukraine crisis has hit Danish beer maker Carlsberg, in a worrying illustration of how geopolitical tensions could hurt the global economy. Carlsberg warned investors that operating profits this year will fail to meet 2013\u2019s levels, due to deteriorating sales in Russia. Carslberg usually makes around a third of its profits from brewing Baltika, Russia\u2019s biggest beer brand. But Russia\u2019s weakening economy \u2013 hit by Western sanctions \u2013 means sale are likely to fall this year. The escalating tensions in the region mean Carlsberg is considering cutting production. It said: In order to mitigate the risks as much as possible, several changes have been and will be made in our Eastern European business, including structural changes. These include considerations related to brewery closures. Shares in Carlsberg are down over 4%. The Argentinian default battle has taken another twist overnight. President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez announced plans for a voluntary debt swap, which would allow it to dodge a US court ruling forcing it to repay \u2018hold-out creditors\u2019 who refused to take part in debt restructuring since its 2001 default. That court ruling forced Argentina to default again last month, as it is prevented from repaying its other creditors. Buenos Aires refuses to repay its holdouts (aggressive hedge funds); Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s plan is to issue bonds under Argentinian law, beyond the reach of US judges. Argentina also plans stop using Bank of New York Mellon as a trustee and instead make bond payments via an account at Banco de la Naci\u00f3n in Buenos Aires. The FT has more details (paywall, sorry). And as Sky News reports, President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez appeared rather emotional, and on the verge of tears, saying: \u201cExcuse me if I get a little nervous, I usually have more poise. \u201cHowever, I really feel that we are living a moment of great injustice in Argentina.\u201d An ambitious plan to merge two of Britain\u2019s biggest construction firms appears to have failed. Balfour Beatty rejected the latest proposal from rival Carillion this morning, insisting that it wasn\u2019t in its shareholders\u2019 interests. Balfour criticised Carillion, for failing to address: \u201cThe considerable risks associated with the proposed business plan, including the strategy to significantly reduce the scale of the UK Construction business when it is poised to benefit from a recovery in the market.\u201d The Takeover Panel had given Carillion until close of play tomorrow to \u2018put up or shut up\u2019, and the latter course looks more likely. Shares in Balfour have tumbled 5.5% this morning. Carillion, which had sweetened its merger terms yesterday, are down 2%. Over in Germany, the latest survey of factory gate prices has brought little respite to Europe\u2019s low inflation problem. The German Producer Prices index, which tracks how much firms receive for their wares, fell by 0.1% last month, and was 0.8% lower than July 2014. It was driven down by falling energy prices. Economists had expected prices to be flat month-on-month, and 0.7% lower year-on-year. Those producer prices feed through to the wider economy, and could help keep consumer prices below target. ING also suspects the minutes could show an 8-1 split, although there\u2019s little change of a majority voting to raise rates until 2015. They write: Today\u2019s minutes to the August MPC meeting may see the first member voting for tighter policy. However, low inflation and stagnant wages suggest a majority in favour of rate hikes is some way off. Joe Bond of city firm Abshire Smith reckons one member of the MPC may have jumped off the fence at this month\u2019s meeting (which took place two weeks ago). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the economy, business and finance. Like house prices and the weather, interest rates are something of a British obsession at present. So the minutes of the latest Bank of England monetary policy meeting, released at 9.30am today, are eagerly awaited in the City and beyond. There\u2019s a possibility that at least one member of the MPC broke ranks and voted to raise bank rate. This would be the first dissent since 2011. Alternatively, the nine-strong committee could have remained united in leaving borrowing costs unchanged, which would probably kibosh talk of an early rate rise. The details of the minutes should also show whether many committee members believe that most of the spare capacity in the UK economy has now been used up. Yesterday\u2019s drop in inflation appears to have put a 2014 rate rise off the agenda - but today\u2019s minutes could change the picture again.... Stan Shamu of IG explains: The focus will be on the BoE MPC meeting minutes, where the market will be looking for any signs that some members are getting hawkish. Last week\u2019s BoE inflation report showed there was \u201ca wide range of views\u201d over the amount of slack that still needs to be mopped up. However, Britain\u2019s weak wage growth remained a major worry, so we\u2019ll see what the MPC said about that too. Not too much else on the agenda today. We get the latest survey of the eurozone construction sector at 10am BST, and the CBI\u2019s survey of UK industrial trends at 11am. I\u2019ll be tracking the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Macy\u2019s agreed to pay $650,000 on Wednesday to settle charges of racial profiling at its flagship Manhattan department store. New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman had been investigating more than a dozen complaints of profiling and false detentions of minority customers at the retailer\u2019s Herald Square flagship store. The agreement is the second Schneiderman has reached with a major New York retailer in as many weeks. Earlier this month Barneys paid $525,000 to settle similar allegations. \u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable \u2013 and it\u2019s illegal \u2013 for anyone in New York to be treated like a criminal simply because of the color of their skin,\u201d Schneiderman said. \u201cRecent allegations of racial profiling at some of New York\u2019s most famous stores stand as a stark reminder that the protections afforded by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 are still needed today \u2013 and that equal justice under law remains an American ideal we are striving to attain. \u201cThis agreement will help ensure that no one is unfairly singled out as a suspected criminal when they shop in New York and that all New Yorkers enjoy full and equal access to our retail establishments.\u201d Schneiderman\u2019s office launched the investigation into Macy\u2019s in February 2013 following complaints from close to two dozen African American, Latino and other customers who are members of ethnic minority groups all of whom claimed that they had been apprehended and detained at Macy\u2019s, despite not having stolen or having attempted to steal any Macy\u2019s merchandise. The consumers alleged they were racially profiled and that staff at the Manhattan store falsely accused minorities of committing crimes at a far greater rate than they accused white customers. Consumers also charged that Macy\u2019s was engaging in improper apprehensions and detentions. Among the charges investigated by Schneiderman were claims that minority customers carrying goods between floors by escalator were wrongly stopped by loss prevention staff, customers with limited English proficiency who were suspected of shoplifting or credit card fraud were not permitted to make phone calls, denied access to an interpreter, and were required to sign trespass notices even though they could not understand the notices. Former Macy\u2019s sales representatives for the Herald Square department store told the attorney\u2019s office that loss prevention employees tracked and followed African American, Latino, and other minority customers much more frequently than white customers. A review of data produced by Macy\u2019s by the attorney\u2019s office found that Macy\u2019s investigated and detained minorities for allegedly shoplifting at significantly higher rates than whites. The fine follows the high-profile case of Rob Brown, who has appeared in The Dark Knight Rises and HBO series Treme. Brown, an African American, sued Macy\u2019s last year after he was detained for nearly an hour by police about possible credit card fraud. He settled the suit earlier this year. This is the second time that Macy\u2019s has settled charges of alleged racial discrimination. In January 2005 the retailer paid $600,000 to settle a complaint that its New York department stores engaged in racial profiling and had unlawfully handcuffed customers detained on suspicion of shoplifting. Macy\u2019s also agreed to appoint an independent expert on anti-discrimination laws and prevention of racial profiling, who will report to the attorney general\u2019s office for three years. It will also post a customers\u2019 bill of rights, in English and Spanish, in a prominent location, and has committed to other anti-profiling policies and training procedures.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carlsberg has warned that problems in Russia will harm its profits more severely than previously thought. The Danish brewer, which earns around one-third of its profits from Russia's bestselling Baltika brand, said Russian sales were likely to fall in the second half of the year, as distributors cut back their orders. \"Unfortunately, we believe the eastern European beer markets will be impacted further as consumers are facing increased challenges and this will impact the group's profits negatively this year,\" said Carlsberg chief executive, J\u00f8rgen Buhl Rasmussen. The brewer is expecting a low to mid single-digit percentage decline in reported operating profits, compared to an earlier forecast of low growth. The announcement sent Carlsberg's share price tumbling 5%, although the stock had recouped some of its losses by mid-morning. While Carlsberg will be seen as a litmus test for how sanctions will hit western companies, not all the brewer's problems are the result of geopolitics. The Russian government has been tightening regulation of beer and spirits to curb alcoholism and binge drinking. In June, the Russian parliament voted to limit the size of plastic beer bottles, a measure that will come into force on 1 January. Politicians have already banned the sale of beer in street kiosks, banished beer advertising from newspapers, TV and outdoor billboards, and reclassified beer as an alcoholic drink. The Russian beer market has fallen by 25% since 2008, while Carlsberg said in May it had underestimated the impact of the ban on selling beer from street kiosks. Carlsberg's flat performance contrasts with its rival Heineken, which reported a better-than-expected 10% increase in operating profits to \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.26bn) for the first half of the year. Heineken has a much smaller presence in Russia, which makes up only a small part of its central and east European division, in turn around 15% of revenues. The company said total beer sales in Russia had fallen because of weaker economic growth and consumer confidence, although it some premium beers were making gains in the country. Heineken, which employs 3,000 people in Russia, making its best-known brands and two dozen local varieties, said it was concerned that geopolitics could damage consumer confidence.",

In June, the Russian parliament voted to limit the size of plastic beer bottles, a measure that will come into force on 1&#xa0;January.

      "bodyText": "The prospect of a pre-Christmas increase in interest rates rose yesterday after two members of the Bank of England's key policy-making body broke ranks and voted for higher borrowing charges. City dealers said it was possible that rates could be lifted from their emergency level of 0.5% by the end of the year, as three years of unanimous 9-0 decisions at Threadneedle Street ended with Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty calling for the cost of borrowing to be raised by 0.25 percentage points. Although the remaining seven members of the monetary policy committee (MPC) opted to leave official interest rates where they have been since March 2009, the split vote surprised financial markets and intensified speculation about the timing of the first upward move by the Bank. Brian Hilliard, economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: \"The market is fully pricing in the first hike in February 2015, which remains our call. There is of course some risk of a November 2014 move, given that cracks have now appeared in the MPC consensus.\" Details of the split on the MPC came from the minutes of the committee's meeting on 7 August, which were released yesterday. The pound rose on the foreign exchanges amid speculation that a rate rise could now come earlier than expected, although some analysts pointed out that the economic news since early August had been less supportive of rapid action. \"The minutes of August's MPC meeting, revealing the first split interest rate vote since July 2011, indicate that a 2014 rate hike cannot be ruled out,\" said Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. \"But the low inflation outlook suggests the odds are still in favour of a delay until early next year.\" According to the minutes, the two dissenting MPC members said the state of the economy justified an immediate rise in the bank rate: \"These members noted that the continuing rapid fall in unemployment alongside survey evidence of tightening in the labour market created a prospect that wage growth would pick up. They noted that it was possible that wages were lagging behind developments in the labour market to some extent. \"If that were true, wages might not start to rise until spare capacity in the labour market were fully used up. Since monetary policy, too, could be expected to operate only with a lag, it was desirable to anticipate labour market pressures by raising Bank rate in advance of them.\" Interest rates have been pegged at 0.5% \u2013 the lowest level in the Bank's 320-year history \u2013 since the deep recession during the winter of 2008-09, but McCafferty and Weale said that even after their proposed 0.25-point rise policy would be highly supportive of growth. An early rise would help ensure that increases in borrowing costs were gradual. The Bank's governor, Mark Carney, had signalled a split on the MPC during last week's inflation report press conference, in which he said that there were differing views on the committee about the amount of slack still remaining in the economy following the deep recession of 2008-09. But he was among the majority on the committee that decided \"there remained insufficient evidence of inflationary pressures to justify an immediate increase in Bank rate\". Those voting for no change in August said \"growth was likely to ease a little as the boost from pent-up demand released by the easing in credit conditions and lifting of uncertainty faded. This would slow the pace at which slack was being eroded. Wage growth remained weak, suggesting that slack in the labour market might have been greater than previously thought. \"In addition, increases in Bank rate well ahead of any pickup in wage and income growth risked increasing the vulnerability of highly indebted households. Finally, an unexpected increase in Bank rate might cause sterling to appreciate further, bearing down on inflation and further impeding UK economic rebalancing.\"",

The settlement comes almost exactly two years after the British bank paid a $340m fine to the DFS after it was accused of scheming with Iran to hide from US authorities billions of pounds worth of transactions. The latest payment follows the bank's failure to tackle problems with its anti-money laundering compliance that the New York regulator required following the 2012 settlement. \"If a bank fails to live up to its commitments, there should be consequences.
