      "bodyText": "It is entirely apt given the government used the budget as its de facto election campaign launch that we now find after the election result that the budget is completely trashed. Launching the campaign so closely after the budget meant none of the key measures contained in it have been presented before parliament. That budget included a large number of spending cuts which failed to get through the old parliament; they have even less of a chance now. In the old parliament, the issue was the merely the Senate, now there is a strong possibility the cuts wouldn\u2019t even pass the lower house. The Coalition might be able to get the numbers to stay in government, but not to keep its budget. And as a result, all those nice shiny figures in the May budget showing a path back to surplus are now just figments of Scott Morrison\u2019s imagination. In fairness they always were \u2013 the ALP was right to compare their budget figures with those of the LNP minus the zombie measures \u2013 measures that had first been in the 2014-15 budget but which were still included in the budget figures because they made the deficit look smaller. While the old Senate was tough enough, the likelihood is that the Coalition will need nine extra votes to get legislation passed in the new Senate. On the current numbers, that looks like being every non-ALP or Greens senator. Hello, Pauline, Derryn, Nick, Jacqui and others, sit down, let\u2019s negotiate. Cripes. And it probably means the government\u2019s centrepiece of company tax cuts is also dead \u2013 although on this score the budget damage shouldn\u2019t be too great because the big impacts were only to arrive once the big businesses were to get a tax cut in 2023-24: Derryn Hinch has previously suggested he will support the small business cuts, so there will be deals to be done there, but the big bold 10-year plan looks to be in tatters. And it comes at a point when the economy is clearly faltering \u2013 and certainly has a worse outlook that it did at the start of the campaign (without factoring in the impact of a hung parliament). When the election campaign began nearly two months ago, the world economy was marked by a sense of fragility and slow growth. The IMF\u2019s world economic outlook suggested that Britain leaving the EU could do severe regional and global damage by disrupting established trading relationships. The OECD in its June outlook suggested a Brexit would cause GDP across the OECD to be 0.6 percentage points lower in 2020 than it otherwise would have been. And so that slow, fragile growth has been given a fairly large bump \u2013 right at a time we didn\u2019t need it to happen. Last Thursday, the latest figures showed that in the May quarter there were 169,400 job vacancies (seasonally adjusted), a fall of 1.8% from the 172,600 in the February quarter. This was worst fall in job vacancies since 2013: Because of a decline in the participation rate, this hasn\u2019t flowed through to a situation where the fight for work is harder \u2013 the number of unemployed per vacancy across Australia is at the lowest level since 2012: The 4.2 unemployed per vacancy is down on the rate for November and February, but if the participation rate had stayed where it was in November, there would be now 4.5 unemployed per vacancy. So if the fight to get a job has improved it is not so much because there are more jobs on offer, but because some of those looking for work have given up. One other measure of the weaker outlook for our economy is that since the start of the campaign the bond yield curve for Australian government bonds has significantly flattened. While the interest rate (or yield) for two-year bonds has not changed, the yield for 10-year bonds has fallen from 2.32% to a record low 1.98%: The flattening of the yield curve suggests that the outlook is one of slowing growth (the flatter the curve is, the worse the outlook, and when the curve slopes downwards, that is a sign of a recession to come). This is due to a number of things, but mostly the fact that after the Brexit vote, Australian bonds are viewed as being safe, but with an overall lower growth outlook. The falling yield is also a sign that despite the talk of Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating being under threat, investors had few fears before Saturday\u2019s vote about the Australian government\u2019s ability to pay its bills. Last week \u2013 despite an election result still being a 50-50 toss up \u2013 the Australian government 10-year bond yield for the first time ever averaged less than 2%: It means the Australian government has access to very cheap debt. Last Monday, the government borrowed $600m for five years at a rate of 1.66% \u2013 lower even than the cash rate. With a cash rate at 1.75%, there is little room for the RBA to cut rates should it need to stimulate the economy. And yet of course we\u2019ve just undergone an election campaign in which the horrors of the ALP having a cumulative deficit over four years of $16.5bn more was taken as some sort of risk. But the reality is the slavish adherence to a budget surplus has utterly outgrown the benefits such a move might produce even in terms of keeping our AAA credit rating. The Liberal party was so keen to appear \u201cstronger economic managers\u201d in the eyes of those who only judge this attribute by the budget balance, that it produced in the last week of the campaign $2.3bn worth of savings via data matching of welfare recipients (now also likely not to be passed). If the way to keep our AAA credit rating is to make scapegoats out of the poorest in society, you really have to question the screwed up sensibilities that underpin much of economic policy. No doubt the make-up of the parliament will have the credit agencies casting another eye over their ratings, but perhaps one change to come from this result is being more worried about the credit agencies than the state of the economy. And if you are pursuing a surplus just to keep your credit rating, then it is just as well your budget won\u2019t pass the parliament.",

      "bodyText": "Police and tax inspectors must be able to discover who sits behind opaque corporate trusts if international efforts to fight tax dodging and corruption in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal are to prove effective, one of the world\u2019s top tax reformers has warned. Pascal Saint-Amans, head of tax at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), said existing efforts to improve the sharing of information between countries \u2013 championed by David Cameron \u2013 needed to go further. In particular, he said countries needed to look again at new registers of company ownership, suggesting these should be improved and expanded. One of his proposals is that as well as recording the beneficial owner of each company, these registers should also show similar information for trusts. An effective regime, Saint-Amans told the Guardian, \u201cwill definitely require improved availability of, and access to, information on beneficial owners of all legal arrangements \u2013 including trusts\u201d. Trusts are particularly controversial because they can be used to create questionable tax structures, to hide corrupt activities or to facilitate money laundering. They are a feature of many common law jurisdictions, and have proved especially popular in the offshore world. Saint-Amans\u2019s comments highlight how isolated the UK has become in its insistence that trusts be largely excluded from international efforts to bring transparency to the most secretive corners of the corporate world. In 2013, Cameron wrote to top European officials making the case for trusts to be exempted from rules, then being drawn up in Brussels, requiring companies to report who they are owned by. He wrote: \u201c[Ownership] registries will \u2026 enable law enforcement and tax authorities to access, discreetly and at short notice, critical information for cross-border investigations. \u201cIt is clearly important we recognise the important differences between companies and trusts. This means that the solution for addressing the potential misuse of companies \u2013 such as [ownership] registries \u2013 may well not be appropriate generally.\u201d After pressure from the UK, it was agreed that only those trusts which \u201cgenerate tax consequences\u201d should be subject to the new Brussels directive. Most tax experts agree this loose wording effectively releases many of the more controversial trusts \u2013 especially those offshore \u2013 from ownership disclosure requirements. In the wake of the series of scandals exposed in the Panama Papers, the UK has led international calls for greater information sharing. Together with France, Germany, Spain and Italy, the UK responded with plans to open up their ownership register to one another\u2019s investigative authorities. In April, the chancellor, George Osborne, said this information sharing initiative was \u201ca hammer blow against those that would illegally evade taxes and hide their wealth in the dark corners of the financial system\u201d. It remains to be seen whether a new UK prime minister will continue Cameron\u2019s efforts to win international consensus on the best way to fight offshore corruption. But last week, the UK became the first major economy to require all companies registered here to state their true ownership in filings at Companies House. Many other large countries are developing similar registers to record company ownership, but have stopped short of making that information public. More than 20 countries have joined the new European initiative allowing police and tax inspectors from each jurisdiction to access one another\u2019s ownership register. They include Gibraltar, Cyprus and the Isle of Man. Despite pressure from the UK, however, many other countries \u2013 including some crown dependencies and overseas territories \u2013 have resisted pressure to set up ownership registers. Saint-Amans and other experts at combating offshore corruption and money laundering are expected to report to the G20 in October. A highly influential figure in international corporate reforms, he spent the last three years leading a G20-commissioned reform programme to end tax loopholes in international rules exploited by some of the world\u2019s largest corporations, including Google, Amazon, Vodafone and Starbucks.",

But last week, the UK became the first major economy to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/people-with-significant-control-companies-house-register-goes-live\">require all companies registered here</a> to state their true ownership in filings at Companies House. <br></p> <p>Many other large countries are developing similar registers to record company ownership, but have stopped short of making that information public. More than 20 countries have joined the new European initiative allowing police and tax inspectors from each jurisdiction to access one another\u2019s ownership register.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown (The key lesson of Brexit is that globalisation must work for all of Britain, 29 June) writes: \u201cThe commission I propose should examine the most controversial issue arising from the free movement of capital, labour, goods and services \u2013 namely migration.\u201d Migration might be controversial but it follows from the free movement of capital across national borders. Under the Bretton Woods-governed international economic order, national economies were spared, for a time, the free flow of speculative financial flows. The freedom to move financial capital in and out of national economies creates instability of currencies, volatility in commodity prices, and short-term profit taking rather than sustainable long-term investment. In the US Treasury Harry Dexter White argued that capital flows were designed to evade \u201cnew taxes or burdens of social legislation\u201d. Keynes, for the UK Treasury, wrote: \u201cThere is no country which can, in future, safely allow the flight of funds for political reasons or to evade domestic taxation or in anticipation of the owner turning refugee.\u201d Is Mr Brown prepared to assert the rights of nation states to control capital flows? Sam Whimster Global Policy Institute \u2022 Gordon Brown has it right \u2013 up to a point. The issue isn\u2019t just about the EU or even about national politics. It\u2019s about globalisation. But what do we do about it? More committees? More \u201cin-depth scrutiny\u201d? More thought about the role of Scotland (and presumably other sub-national as well as national jurisdictions)? We can\u2019t just \u201ctake back control\u201d because control is no longer in the hands of national politicians or even European-level policymaking. The problem is much broader. It requires a global approach \u2013 a fundamental shift away from the austerian, neoliberal, free marketeering kind of globalisation that became embedded in national life in both developed and developing countries, in the EU and in the fragmented attempts at \u201cglobal governance\u201d that took root in the late 20th century. It needs a revised and updated version of the mixed economy and welfare state: a revived social contract that supports growth, provides efficient public goods, enables social mobility for ordinary people, limits inequality, and protects the most vulnerable. This needs to be pursued not only at domestic level, or even at EU level, though the revival of the notion of a \u201csocial Europe\u201d would be a start. It requires new forms of international cooperation on such matters as a financial transactions tax, a wealth tax of the kind proposed by Thomas Piketty, the increased regulation of markets and, most of all, an ideological shift away from the kind of \u201cefficient markets\u201d theory that has been dominant in both academic economics and economic policymaking in recent decades. We need a new global social contract. Brexit, unfortunately, just fragments the process and makes the problem worse. Philip Cerny Professor emeritus of politics and global affairs, University of Manchester and Rutgers University \u2022 Gordon Brown is wrong in thinking that economic globalisation, which has made life so precarious and insecure for the majority in most countries, can ever be \u201cmade to work for all\u201d. Its European manifestation of open borders to the free movement of people, goods, capital and services has ensured that working people across the EU have been forced to increasingly compete with each other to their own personal detriment, but to the benefit of big business and finance. The Brexit vote showed that those disadvantaged by this process grasp this in terms of the free movement of people at least. It is hardly surprising that when given an opportunity not available in a general election, where all major parties supported open EU borders, that they leaped at the chance of using the referendum to say no. Now that the renegotiation era is dawning it is utterly crucial that we in the UK call for controls on damaging open borders to be the key condition for our future relationship with the EU. This will also resonate with the concerns of the populations of the other 27 EU countries, all of whom want to take back control of their economies to enable their local communities to flourish. Most crucially this will help reduce the growing sense of economic insecurity and impotence caused by globalisation\u2019s open borders emphasis. It is this that has acted as such an ominous 1930s-style recruiting sergeant for Europe\u2019s extreme right. Colin Hines Twickenham, Middlesex \u2022 Gordon Brown\u2019s plan for ensuring that global trade is fair shows yet again what a tragedy for British politics it was not to have a Lib-Lab pact for electoral reform in 2010 in place of the Tory coup which has resulted in economic and political self-destruction. Margaret Phelps Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan \u2022 A key plank in the leave case seemed to be that there were far more opportunities for trade outside the EU than inside. Could we please hear more about the plans for negotiations with Canada, China, India, and the rest of the world, and less about how to scavenge a few scraps from the EU table. Vivian Cook Colchester, Essex \u2022 Giles Fraser (Labour is partly to blame for the racists\u2019 capture of the EU debate, 1 July) is so well-meaning, and so mistaken. The idea that capitalism can be tamed by one country the size of Britain is a fantasy. The EU was one of our few opportunities to tame the beast; Brexit is only coherent as a political project if you are a rightwing deregulator. And how does Giles think Africa is going to generate the jobs for its projected quadrupling of its population this century without massive investment by international capital? There is so much that can be done to create jobs and hope for people in deprived communities, within the framework of international capitalism, by investing in the transition to a green economy: see the New Climate Economy reports. Abandoning globalisation for protectionism would undermine action on climate change; regional blocs would compete with each other, and focus on energy security by prioritising access to fossil fuel reserves. Or put another way, in today\u2019s world \u201cloving your neighbour\u201d has to mean your neighbour on the other side of the world, too. Giles, your theology is too small. Huw Brodie Cardiff \u2022 Felicity Lawrence (Report, 1 July) asks what are the options before us in a globalising world and how to respond to migration. Congratulations to her for setting out the progressive answer: a strong social framework that stops the low-wage, long-hours, no-regulation culture that predominates in so much of our labour market and others across Europe. That requires a break from the naive, Panglossian view of globalisation promoted by New Labour, on which \u201cold Labour\u201d took its revenge in the referendum. In contrast, Giles Fraser peddles the fantasy, that progressives can go against the realities of modern life \u2013 where the economy and culture have escaped the boundaries of the nation state \u2013 and challenge \u201cthe villains\u201d of \u201cadvanced capitalism\u201d within one country. As Lawrence shows, the left must not kid itself that there is a progressive bolthole for English nationalism. There isn\u2019t. The answer \u2013 even more so now \u2013 is to propose an alternative model of globalisation, explicitly recognising its downsides. Gordon Brown\u2019s call \u201cto tame globalisation\u201d is a welcome, if belated, shift in thinking. Progressives now need to put policy flesh on those bones, working as closely as we can in the process with our European neighbours. Jon Bloomfield Birmingham",

Lady Judge, who stepped down last month, said the regulator was not equipped to deal with situations such as that at BHS, sold by Sir Philip Green to Dominic Chappell for \u00a31 last year and now left with an estimated \u00a3571m pensions black hole. \u201cThe regulator should have the right to approve or disapprove any corporate transaction that might disadvantage pensioners,\u201d the Financial Times quoted Judge as saying. \u201cIf it had had the power, we would not be in this situation.\u201d However, the pensions minister, Ros Altmann, suggested such an approach would be too strong. \u201cI would be nervous about saying a transaction could not take place. But we must be clearer [to companies] about the consequences of failure to get clearance for a deal. \u201cIf we need to give the regulator more powers we will, but it is not clear yet. Any changes would need to be done with careful consideration and not kneejerk reaction.\u201d Lady Altmann said the regulator needed to be given the chance to carry out its report on the BHS pension scheme. But Judge said pensioners needed more protection. \u201cWe need to take care of [pensioners] as a country and not let unscrupulous big corporates put them in a position where they won\u2019t be able to have a reasonable future,\u201d she said. In a separate interview, Altmann said Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union would place greater strain on companies with defined benefit pension schemes, driving deficits higher if the economy weakens and interest rates stay lower for longer. She said that under such circumstances, businesses should not be forced into putting too much money into schemes. \u201cI do think it\u2019s important that when we\u2019re making plans for the future the government recognises that employers are having, in some cases, a really difficult time supporting the pension promises they have made. \u201cPart of the reason for that is the trend in interest rates. What we don\u2019t want to do is offset some of the stimulus by forcing companies to put too much money into their pensions in the near term if they can\u2019t afford it, so there\u2019s that delicate balancing act.\u201d Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has signalled that Threadneedle Street is ready to pump more money into the economy following the shock Brexit vote. Immediately after the result was announced Carney said the Bank was prepared to provide UK banks with an additional \u00a3250bn of liquidity. The governor has also hinted that interest rates could be cut from their record low of 0.5%. Another option available to the Bank would be more quantitative easing, where new money is created to buy assets such as government bonds. QE was first launched in March 2009, as the Bank attempted to limit the impact of the financial crisis.",

What we don\u2019t want to do is offset some of the stimulus by forcing companies to put too much money into their pensions in the near term if they can\u2019t afford it, so there\u2019s that delicate balancing act.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/mark-carney\">Mark Carney</a>, the governor of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">Bank of England</a>, has signalled that Threadneedle Street is ready to pump more money into the economy following the shock Brexit vote.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/24/bank-of-england-mark-carney-says-brexit-contingency-plans-under-way\"> Immediately after the result was announced Carney said the Bank was prepared to provide UK banks with an additional \u00a3250bn of liquidity.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/30/interest-rate-cut-likely-brexit-bank-of-england-mark-carney\">The governor has also hinted that interest rates could be cut from their record low of 0.5%.</a> Another option available to the Bank would be more quantitative easing, where new money is created to buy assets such as government bonds. </p> <p>QE was first launched in March 2009, as the Bank attempted to limit the impact of the financial crisis.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney will this week spell out the financial risks sparked by the vote for Brexit in remarks that will be closely watched for any measures to help banks free up capital and keep loans flowing to businesses and households. After warning that the risks around the referendum posed the \u201cmost significant near term\u201d domestic risk to financial stability, the governor of the Bank of England indicated last week he was ready to take actions to ensure the fallout from the vote does not create conditions that could lead to a re-run of the credit crunch or the 2008 banking crisis. This sparked speculation the Bank could use its twice-yearly assessment of risks to the financial system, due to be published on Tuesday, to unveil measures which could relax the amount of capital banks must hold. It could also encourage policymakers to reinvigorate a scheme intended to encourage banks to lend. Carney referred to this week\u2019s half-yearly risk assessment, known as the financial stability report (FSR), in his speech last Thursday, when most of the focus was on his remarks that an interest rate cut would be needed in the summer to stimulate the economy after the Brexit vote. He spoke after chairing the quarterly meeting of the financial policy committee, which is responsible for producing the Bank\u2019s regular reviews of financial stability. Tuesday\u2019s FSR will be published against a backdrop of sharp falls in bank share prices and a plunge in the pound. Since the referendum on 23 June, sterling has hit a 31-year low against the dollar. Shares of most the major banks also fell on concerns about the impact that even lower interest rates could have on their profitability at a time when economic growth is expected to slow sharply. Carney mentioned the half-yearly assessment of financial risks in last week\u2019s speech: \u201cNext Tuesday, the independent financial policy committee will release its biannual assessment of risks in its financial stability report, and it will take any further actions it deems appropriate to support financial stability.\u201d One possibility is a temporary relaxation in the amount of capital banks are required to hold. Only at the start of the year, as the economy has recovered from the banking crisis, lenders had been ordered to hive off a part of their capital \u2013 known in banking jargon as \u201ccounter-cyclical capital buffers\u201d \u2013 that could then be released in the event of a downturn. Bloomberg reported last week that Carney was considering allowing such a release. While this would free up only a small fraction of the amount of capital banks must hold, it could be regarded as a symbolic move to ease pressures on banks. The funding for lending scheme, which was first introduced four years ago to provide cheap loans to banks in return to lending, could be given renewed vigour. Economists at Investec said: \u201cTuesday\u2019s financial stability report could prove to be significant, perhaps for a cut in the counter-cyclical capital buffer. The governor conveyed a concrete message that financial and monetary policy will act in the same direction. Presumably this applies to credit policy too, with the possibility of a widening and an extension in the funding for lending scheme.\u201d There are expectations that interest rates will be cut from their already historic low of 0.5% as part of the effort by the Bank and the government to cushion any economic downturn. \u201cUK policymakers are looking to leave no doubt in the minds of investors, businesses and consumers that they will do whatever they can to support the economy,\u201d said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. He said Carney and the chancellor, George Osborne, who on Friday abandoned his austerity-driven aim to be running a surplus in 2020, were \u201clooking to shore up confidence so as to try and limit cautious behaviour by businesses and consumers as they seemingly face a prolonged, very uncertain economic environment, that is currently being magnified by political turmoil\u201d. \u201cThere can be little doubt that part of the Bank of England\u2019s package will be to cut interest rates from 0.50% to 0.25%, very possibly on 14 July,\u201d said Archer. He said he doubted rates would reach negative territory, citing the remark by Carney last week when he said: \u201cAs we have seen elsewhere, if interest rates are too low (or negative), the hit to bank profitability could perversely reduce credit availability or even increase its overall price.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Fines imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the first half of 2016 have fallen to \u00a37.2m \u2013 less than 1% of the figure of a year before. The plunge in fines from \u00a3819m in the same period last year follows a period of turbulence for the FCA and coincides with the arrival of Andrew Bailey from the Bank of England as the watchdog\u2019s chief executive. The number of fines has also fallen, almost halving to 13 from 24 in the first half of last year. Eight of the fines, totalling \u00a33.2m, resulted from an investigation into the failure of insurance schemes for law firms. Two companies and six people were fined. George Osborne forced out Martin Wheatley, the FCA\u2019s previous chief executive, a year ago after the City complained about his tough approach to regulation. After the Conservatives won the May 2015 election, Osborne said he wanted a new settlement with the banking sector and an end to blaming them for the financial crisis. Tracey McDermott, who was closely linked with Wheatley\u2019s hard line, took over running the FCA but dropped out of the running for the permanent job in January after an inquiry into banks\u2019 culture was scrapped. McDermott denied there had been any softening of the FCA\u2019s approach. Osborne chose Bailey to run the FCA soon after McDermott withdrew, recruiting him from the BoE where he ran the regulatory division for three years. Bailey, whom the City regards as less antagonistic, started on Friday. Peter Snowdon, a partner at the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said the drop in fines reflected uncertainty at the FCA, a less aggressive approach and a heavy workload for its staff. \u201cI think there has been a sea change that probably happened after the election with Martin Wheatley and Tracey McDermott going, the cessation of the initiative on banking culture and so on. We\u2019ve had a sense from things we\u2019ve been working on that \u2018shoot first and ask questions afterwards\u2019 is not the current mood.\u201d The FCA declined to comment. The figure for the first half of last year was inflated by more than \u00a3500m of fines for two banks that rigged financial markets including a record \u00a3284m imposed on Barclays for manipulating foreign exchange rates. Fines tailed off in the second half of last year to \u00a386m. The FCA was launched in early 2013 after its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, was broken up. The FSA was heavily criticised during the financial crisis for going easy on the City and allowing risks to build up in the system. In March 2009 Hector Sants, the FCA\u2019s then chief executive, signalled a harder line and said the City should be \u201cvery frightened\u201d of it. Before this year, fines mounted steadily from \u00a38.4m in the first half of 2009 to a peak of \u00a31.34bn in the second half of 2014 when the FCA under Wheatley dished out \u00a31.1bn of penalties to banks for foreign exchange rigging. Rachel Couter, a partner at the law firm King &amp; Wood Mallesons said: \u201cI think the figures indicate the FCA is in the process of restocking its enforcement book following resolution of the foreign exchange investigations in mid-2015 and the release of staff who had been fully occupied there. I suspect we will begin to see an uptick in fines in the second half as some of these new investigations begin to reach closure.\u201d The regulator\u2019s fines were previously used to fund its operations, but in 2012 Osborne changed the law to divert the money to the Treasury. Osborne has handed most of the fines to causes such as armed forces charities and those involved in helping the emergency services. The drop means less money will be available for that purpose.",

      "bodyText": "Britons have enjoyed nearly two years of cheaper groceries as struggling supermarkets battle for shoppers but the historic vote to leave the EU could spell higher prices in store. The drop in the value of the pound is already reverberating through the food industry as farmers, producers and retailers face up to rising input and sourcing costs. And longer term they will also face new, potentially more costly, conditions governing the flow of goods - and people - in and out of the country. Why will the weakness of sterling push up food prices? Britain produces roughly 60% of the food it consumes and as of last week the remainder got a lot more expensive to import. The post-referendum financial market gyrations have dented retailers\u2019 buying power, with the pound falling 11% against the dollar and 8.7% against the euro since the poll. According to the National Farmers Union (NFU), only 15% of the fresh fruit sold in the UK and 55% of the vegetables are grown here. Most of the rest, including citrus and soft fruits, comes from the EU. Pork is another foodstuff likely to be heavily affected, as nearly 40% sold in the UK comes from overseas. What about farmers? The NFU president, Meurig Raymond, says the weakness of sterling will make food more expensive to produce as the price of inputs such as fertiliser, protein feed and energy rise. \u201cWe have seen exchange rates fall in the last week and there is no doubt that is going to add to the cost of inputs, as they mostly trade in dollars,\u201d he said. Farmers are also nervous about the withdrawal of EU subsidies. British farmers received \u20ac3.1bn from Brussels through the common agricultural policy last year, with the average income just over \u00a320,000 in 2014, 55% of which came from the EU, according to the NFU. Fuel costs The weakness of sterling pushes up business overheads because gas and electricity is heavily influenced by crude oil, which is traded in dollars. Transport costs will also come under pressure as the cost of running vehicles, from tractors ploughing fields to retailers\u2019 wagons thundering down motorways to replenish stores, starts to bite. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said the price of diesel had risen 2.6p a litre since the referendum. With some investment banks predicting the pound could fall from its current level of $1.33 to $1.15, Madderson said a decline to that level would potentially add 5p to pump prices. \u201c100% of food across the UK is moved by road, we are a road transport economy and what happens to fuel prices will have a significant impact on prices in the shops,\u201d he said. Skills shortages The food and retail industry is heavily reliant on workers from other EU countries, with 292,000 migrants working in UK manufacturing and another 230,000 in retail and wholesaling in 2015, according to ONS figures. Earlier this week Ian Wright, director general of the Food and Drink Federation, warned that the food industry could face a skills shortage as more than a quarter of its 450,000 workforce comes from eastern Europe. \u201cWe would expect that any curtailment of freedom of movement of EU nationals coming to the UK will have some impact, given that so many are currently employed by retailers,\u201d said the Verdict Retail analyst Maureen Hinton. \u201cThis constraint to labour supply may push wages up, though this impact may be mitigated by retailers cutting down on staff, in a bid to rein in the increased costs of goods in their supply chain.\u201d So will prices rise? Grocery prices tumbled 1.4% over the last three months and have now been in decline for almost two years. British shoppers can thank the growing might of Aldi and Lidl for putting pressure on rival supermarkets to cut prices but will they be able to absorb new Brexit-related price pressures or instead pass them on to consumers if sterling remains under pressure? Kantar Worldpanel\u2019s Fraser McKevitt says the answer is a complex one due to the number of moving parts: \u201cIf sterling stays 10% lower will we see price rises of 10%? No. The market couldn\u2019t take it. You also have to look at how much of a product\u2019s cost is down to importing it as opposed to moving, warehousing and chilling it [in the UK]. It is not a one-to-one relationship but we are likely to see price rises in very basic foodstuffs like fruit and veg in the coming months.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thomas Piketty\u2019s book Capital thrust inequality to centre stage in the socio-economic debate. And Brexit has dome something even more remarkable \u2013 putting inequality at the top of the agenda in financial dealing rooms around the world. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) immediately called Brexit the \u201cbiggest electoral riposte yet to [the] age of inequality\u201d. Investment group Pimco, which manages $1.5 trillion of bonds, warned clients about the \u201cbattle against inequality\u201d. Meanwhile French giant Axa (with \u20ac666bn under its belt) concluded: \u201cUK voters have taken their frustrations about income inequality out on the EU.\u201d Back in the days before the fateful 23 June vote, the issue of inequality would merit less of a place in trading research than the prospects for Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers. Economists and fund managers were singing in harmony about the benefits of globalisation. This divide \u2013 with the City on one side and blue-collar workers in Britain\u2019s equivalent of the American flyover/rustbelt states, places such as Doncaster, Hull, Wigan, Burnley and Stoke, on the other \u2013 was one reason why Brexit came as such a surprise to the market. It shouldn\u2019t have done. The evidence has been there for some time now. Half of working Britain has seen no rise in living standards since the early 2000s, according to the Resolution Foundation. Net disposable income per head is still significantly below 2007 levels. And some divides have grown much deeper over the last two decades: between north and south, between \u201cprofessional\u201d and unskilled, and between the securely employed and the reserve army of the precariously self-employed and zero-hours workers. These are the people whose disillusionment fuelled such a desire to smash the political status quo. Fingers are also being pointed at runaway executive pay. Last week, Hermes Investment Management, which advises 42 investors holding a total of \u00a3170bn, said bosses\u2019 pay had probably contributed to the alienation felt by many Leave voters, and urged shareholders to rein it back. David Sproul, chief executive of Deloitte, also said action was necessary to close the gap between the \u201chaves and have-nots\u201d. What to do? Piketty\u2019s answer is 696 pages long. One of the first things our now prime minister-in-waiting, Theresa May, did after the Tories came to power in 2010, was to gut the Equality Act, introduced by Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman. Since Brexit, she has become something of a convert to fighting the \u201cburning injustices\u201d that have led to inequality. We\u2019ll see. To the credit of BAML, its age of inequality analysis pre-dates Brexit. It was stoked by an early voter rebellion against inequality, California\u2019s Prop 30 in 2012. This week, San Francisco city supervisors proposed a 1.5% payroll tax targeted at the city\u2019s tech companies, to help provide affordable housing for those priced out of the housing market by wealthy tech workers. But when bankers, fund managers and traders start talking about inequality, it is not because they have suddenly turned into Islington lefties. What interests them is what assets or strategies will be most affected as electorates take revenge. BAML reckons the upshot will be trade protectionism, higher taxes, higher minimum wages and a demand for New Deal-style public works. The losing stocks? The likes of \u201cluxury retail\u201d that have benefited from money funnelling upwards to the rich. The winning stocks? Companies serving the mass market. One striking feature of market movements this week was the reaction of bond markets. The UK, a country riven by political crisis, saw yields on some of its government bonds go negative \u2013 a sign that markets are desperate to lend to the government, not run for the hills. But is this the bond market\u2019s last hurrah? Populism nearly always leads to inflation. Will Brexit turn out to be, finally, the catalyst that reverses the great decades-long bull market in bonds? Financiers won\u2019t hang around for EU talks Suitcases packed. Phrasebooks in hand. No, not British tourists heading to the Costa del Sol, but \u2013 if you believe the Brexit doom-mongers \u2013 City bankers fleeing the referendum result. It is, in truth, too soon after the Leave campaign\u2019s victory for a stampede. But part of the fallout expected from last week\u2019s Brexit vote is a mass transfer of UK-based finance jobs to the European Union. JP Morgan has said 4,000 roles could move, while HSBC has said 1,000 could end up in Paris. CityUK, the industry lobby group, published research before the referendum suggesting Brexit could lead to 100,000 fewer financial services jobs in the UK by 2020. There is little evidence of an immediate movement. Indeed, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan insisted last week they had not rented office space in Frankfurt. But speculation is rife about which country stands the best chance of wooing destabilised bankers. For instance, the ratings agency Fitch reckons the Netherlands or Ireland would be more likely choices than France or Germany because the former countries have less stringent employment laws. Property experts at consultancy Capital Economics have plumped for Paris on the basis that it is the only city with enough spare office space to cope with such an influx. Capital Economics reckons the numbers of people involved would require 1m square metres \u2013 too much for Dublin or Frankfurt. It has been suggested that the exodus of bankers might help put a lid on London\u2019s soaring housing market \u2013 and it might not be long before the capital finds out. The extent of the job losses and office moves will depend on the deal the UK government can secure with the 27 remaining members of the bloc. But the major international banks will not want to wait around if exit talks are protracted. The longer the negotiations, the bigger the risk to the City \u2013 and the greater the potential benefit to rival financial hubs. Shares have recovered, but the shocks aren\u2019t over This time last week dealers across the financial world had strapped on their tin hats. The Leave vote had shocked the markets, which had rallied on the assumption the result would be Remain. Billions were wiped off share prices. But after a few gyrations the FTSE 100 index ended the week higher than before the referendum, at a 10-month high. Those billions had been wiped back on, and some. Why? Well money needs a home and the alternative \u2013 record low yields on the bond markets \u2013 is unattractive. Interest rates are on the way down again and the Bank of England may even use quantitative easing to keep the economy\u2019s wheels turning. But the more UK-biased FTSE 250 index is still down, and sterling has sunk to 30-year lows. Business confidence is already battered. This is going to run and run \u2013 and it is going to be a bumpy ride.",

Business confidence is already battered. This is going to run and run \u2013 and it is going to be a bumpy ride.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The City is in a panic. Executives at the big banks, insurers and consultancies are stressing over the implications of something they never expected to happen. There is a frayed anxiety underlying all their conversations, even though they talk about the trapdoor marked Brexit not opening for at least two years and possibly longer (some still believe it will never happen). Brexit gives Europe a chance to wrest away some of the financial functions provided by London. Worse, outside the EU, London could face extra competition from centres closer to the global centre of economic gravity, like Singapore and Hong Kong. At an event last week staged by the lobbying organisation TheCityUK, senior figures in the industry attempted to help their peers figure out what they might do next. Douglas Flint, the chairman of HSBC, had a warning for his colleagues: refrain from lobbying for the industry\u2019s sectional interests; be very discreet; and be seen to be batting for Britain, not the City. David Sproul, boss of the accountancy firm Deloitte\u2019s, went further. He said the City had overplayed its hand during the recovery, leaving behind people in towns like Sunderland and Hartlepool. Deloitte has apprentices with A-levels from some of the poorest districts in the country, he said, but the firm\u2019s welcoming hand stretches only as far as London boroughs like Newham. The north-east was, he confessed, off its radar. Flint made a further stab at appearing contrite. Voters, he said, had rejected what he termed the \u201cexpert class\u201d, referring to the widely reported jibe made by Tory leadership candidate Michael Gove. And bankers should welcome the stringent regulations of the post-crash world, drop their objections and accept it as the price of stability and citizen consent. Does that mean he told his pub mates the price of remaining in the EU was keeping the 50p tax rate, embracing the Vickers review and living a less ostentatious life? Possibly. He certainly said City folk needed to pay themselves less and workers more to assuage the resentment that he failed to recognise, but which was obvious for all to see before the referendum vote. And that must be the question for the City and to a great extent the nation, which has come to depend heavily on the financial services industry for jobs, tax revenue and especially foreign income. How can it prosper, moderate its risky behaviour and keep people in Stoke-on-Trent from using their democratic vote to poison the well, killing the banks and themselves at the same time? Painful though it is to think of, for the time being the economy needs the financial services industry. Some of the figures that illustrate its importance to Britain are startling. Together with the professional services firms that feed off the banks and insurers, the industry employs more than 7% of the UK workforce, producing nearly 12% of total economic output, and contributing 11% of tax revenues. Most importantly, the industry generates a trade surplus of \u00a372bn a year. This surplus goes to close the gap created by an enormous deficit in imported goods, and a steep decline in Britain\u2019s investment income from abroad in the last few years. Bank of England governor Mark Carney constantly battles those who believe the banks will cost more to save than they will ever generate for the economy. He was at pains last week to reassure the nation that the current swings in financial markets and the tumbling value of the pound were within the limits of the regulators\u2019 capabilities. His backstop of \u00a3250bn, which he stands ready to pump into the markets if suddenly everyone wants to sell and nobody wants to buy, would be enough, along with all the capital reserves available to banks, to protect us from another crash, he said. Everyone wants to believe he is right. However, it\u2019s just a tactical issue when the real problem is a strategic one \u2013 a problem that relates to Flint\u2019s thoughts on finding a way to a more profitable but safer banking system. It is, of course, a circle that cannot be squared in Flint\u2019s myopic worldview. Banks need to take risks if they are to recapture even half the 25% return on equity they enjoyed before 2008. At the moment it is 9%. But that\u2019s impossible when there are trillions of dollars of savings chasing only a handful of investment opportunities. Tougher regulation of banks has only pushed the risky behaviour into other areas of the financial system. The Bank for International Settlements \u2013 known as the central bank of central bankers \u2013 has warned that a \u201crisky trinity\u201d of threats hangs over the financial system, including the huge amount of debt taken on by asset managers, pension funds and others away from the banking system. Anastasia Nesvetailova, the director of the Political Economy Research Centre at City University, argues this debt mountain is so large that if it collapses, engulfing the financial system, it will cause a depression worse than the one experienced in 2008. George Osborne\u2019s decision to relax his fiscal rules could allow for higher government borrowing and greater public investment. This is a policy that Flint and his City colleagues must embrace. Unfortunately, the logic of safer borrowing by governments, as we move to a more sustainable balance of debt to spending, is at odds with their neoliberal ideology.",
