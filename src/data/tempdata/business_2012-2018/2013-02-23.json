      "bodyText": "As David Cameron strode out to bat against a bunch of Mumbai schoolboy cricketers during last week's visit to India, one sensed his advisers wincing. They could see that the photo opportunity presented one or two obvious risks for the prime minister, and they were proved right. After Cameron unleashed a couple of rasping cover drives, some cheeky oik had the audacity to remove the PM's off stump. If that knockabout match provided political commentators with opportunities for cheeky metaphors, Cameron seemed keen to provide City observers with a similar opportunity. The first lord of the Treasury also used his Indian sales trip to berate Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester, for what Cameron views as the banker's Geoffrey Boycott-paced innings at the largely state-owned bank. Hester was pressed to \"accelerate\" preparations towards allowing a sell-off of the bank, possibly before the next general election in 2015, and Cameron confirmed that the government was examining an \"interesting\" idea that would involve RBS shares being distributed to taxpayers for free. The idea has provoked interest, but perhaps not in the way implied. The remarks caused more than the odd eyebrow to arch among City statisticians keeping the RBS score, as few believe the bank is really ready for that particular test. Certainly the stock market is sceptical about the bank's recovery, and the taxpayer is nursing losses of \u00a313bn on its RBS stake, and a further \u00a35bn on its smaller holding in Lloyds Banking Group. Ian Gordon, Investec's respected banking analyst, called the idea \"ironic\", as it was more likely that RBS would be forced to issue more shares than the government to sell its stake. And the Bank of England had already made it clear that it wants to see the government strengthening the banks further. David Buik, of financial spread betting firm Cantor Index, said: \"Giving shares away would send a dreadful sign as far as I'm concerned. It would make it look like a pig in a poke that nobody can do anything with and they just have to give the shares away.\" Still if, like Cameron, you are of the view that RBS could soon be in a position where it might be returned to private ownership, take a look at this week's results when the bank, and its fellow Lloyds, are expected to report combined pre-tax losses of around \u00a36bn. It is now four years (almost to the day) since the newly appointed Hester announced the biggest loss in British corporate history, a shocking \u00a324bn, effectively requiring \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds to prop up the tottering RBS. At the time, Hester was viewed as the potential saviour of an institution \u2013 and a system \u2013 on the brink of collapse. Now he is more pitied in the City, where he has a reputation as a highly capable banker wrestling with a completely impossible job. For his part, Hester describes the intervening years as a \"soap opera\" during which his efforts have been overshadowed by a more fragile than expected economy, plus rows about bonuses and the structure of the banking industry. He has some achievements. Around \u00a3800bn has been removed from RBS's balance sheet, roughly equivalent to the size of Spain's economy. That has been accomplished as almost 60,000 jobs have been axed and numerous businesses sold or closed down, in part to comply with European Union rules on state aid. Hester is expected to announce the partial float of RBS's US bank, Citizens, this week (see box). But there appears to be much still to be done. In a research note sent to clients last week, analysts at Swiss bank Credit Suisse wrote: \"RBS remains one of our least-preferred names in the [banking] sector as we continue to think that the group's capital position is limiting a much-needed, more radical restructuring.\" And when Hester presents the 2012 figures on Thursday, pre-tax losses for the year will still be around \u00a34.4bn, as RBS makes further writedowns on its assets and is hit by exceptional costs. The following day, at the UK's other bailed-out bank, the picture will be less gruesome \u2013 slightly. The management clearout at Lloyds followed a \u00a320bn taxpayer injection, as the impact of the rescue of HBOS left a \u00a348bn hole in the books. Around 30,000 jobs have gone at Lloyds since 2009 \u2013 and some 45,000 will have disappeared by the time newish boss Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio completes his three-year restructuring in 2014. But as with the rest of the sector, the old nightmares remain. Lloyds, which was last week fined \u00a34.3m for delays in compensation payments to up to 140,000 customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI), is this week expected to follow Barclays's lead by increasing its PPI provisions, even though its bill already stands at \u00a35.3bn. Both Lloyds and RBS are also faced with having to sell batches of branches, as demanded by the EU, with RBS seemingly ready to float 316 branches (possibly under the Williams &amp; Glyn's name) after Santander pulled out of buying them. Meanwhile, the interminable sale of 632 Lloyds branches to the Co-op stutters on \u2013 with a stock market listing still being mooted as a possible fallback position. Such have been the difficulties with both of these disposals, however, that some analysts have begun suggesting that a merger of the two might make for a better float. Elsewhere both Hester and Horta-Os\u00f3rio are wrestling with the changing environment as they attempt to digest the implications of the separation of high street banks from their \"casino\" investment divisions, as recommended by the commission chaired by Sir John Vickers. For RBS the implications of this are huge, even though Hester has already scaled down the division which his predecessor had expanded so rapidly and disastrously. A few Square Mile observers believe this process will end with RBS wiping out its investment banking division entirely. Investec's Gordon is predicting a strong bounceback in RBS's investment banking division in this week's numbers, and gives Hester a mixed report card against his seven goals set four years ago. He adds: \"The entire management team has changed, and I have little doubt that genuine improvements have been made to [RBS] processes and culture. That said, RBS remains mired in the 'issues of the past' \u2013 PPI, interest swap mis-selling, Libor, IT failures \u2026 So perhaps the scale of improvement is somewhat obscured. Unfortunately, it will remain obscured within the group's financial performance for some time to come.\" When the total pots are unveiled this week, bonuses will, of course, become a toxic issue yet again. The chancellor has already told RBS that the \u00a3300m Libor fine being paid to the US is to be taken directly from the bonus pool \u2013 which could slump to \u00a3250m in investment banking from \u00a31bn four years ago. Meanwhile there is talk of Horta-Os\u00f3rio's bonus being contingent on Lloyds shares hitting 74p \u2013 the break-even point for the taxpayer. The shares were the best performing in the FTSE 100 last year, gaining 85%. They closed at 54p this week. All of that rumbles on against the seemingly constant backdrop of the eurozone crisis, a weak UK economy and lingering anxiety about bombs ticking quietly unnoticed on banks' balance sheets. The Financial Services Authority is conducting a review of all banks to assess whether they are hiding bad debts through the use of forbearance on lending, and any more bills for mis-selling of payment protection insurance or interest rate swaps. That in turn makes the prospects for all-important dividends look bleak. Lloyds seems to stand the best chance of resuming payouts first, while Hester said earlier this month that he was hopeful for 2014. Four years into his five-year plan, he may feel he cannot leave until the dividend is resumed, but when that point arrives most observers believe he will see it as a blessing. Louise Cooper, founder of the financial analysis blog coopercity.co.uk, says: \"Like a new year's diet, Stephen Hester has done a great job in detoxifying RBS's balance sheet. But he has not rebuilt the beleaguered bank into a new Hester-shaped entity. He is still dealing with the Fred the Shred past, and not building for the future. Destructive capitalism is a good thing but creative capitalism must take its place... It is often the case that a chief executive who turns around the business and saves it from failure is not the chief executive to build it up again. They tend to be separate skills. The headhunters will be hovering.\" Or as some might put it: sometimes you need the stout defence of a Geoff Boycott, but at other times you just need to send in the big hitter. US venture faces float Royal Bank of Scotland is this week expected to reveal plans for a partial flotation of its US retail bank, Citizens, in a deal expected to raise around \u00a31.5bn for the state-backed lender. The announcement of the float, which will be made along with the bank's full-year results on Thursday, comes after pressure from regulators and politicians keen to see the taxpayer-backed bank strengthen its balance sheet and focus more on the UK. A share sale should see around 20% of Citizenss floated in America, valuing the whole of the US bank at around \u00a38bn. The move would follow a similar strategy which saw RBS list part of its insurance business, Direct Line, on the London Stock Exchange last year. RBS insiders say that Stephen Hester resisted pressure to sell off the bank earlier, as he feared it would be viewed as a fire sale and lower the price. The hope on the RBS board is that a partial flotation will allow the open market to decide the value of Citizens, as well as potentially drawing out prospective bidders willing to pay a full price for the bank. Although Citizens has always been considered part of RBS's core, and therefore theoretically part of its future, Hester has been preparing to sell it for some time. It is self-funded, well-capitalised, and has a near-independent technological platform. This last is of huge importance: in 2012 Santander pulled out of a deal to buy 316 RBS branches, citing IT problems.",

    "webTitle": "George Osborne under pressure as Britain loses AAA rating for first time", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain was stripped of its AAA-rated debt status for the first time ever on Friday night in a move that puts pressure on George Osborne, who had pledged to use his austerity measures to protect the rating. The chancellor, who had 12 hours' notice of the decision by Moody's ratings agency, insisted he would stick to his course and had \"redoubled\" his resolve to tackle Britain's financial problems. However, the downgrading will have major political implications for the coalition. Labour and the Tories acknowledge that the next election is likely to be decided on the debate over the best way of fixing the economy. Osborne, however, will be forced to listen to a series of opposing politicians reminding him of his previous promises that he would maintain Britain's top rating. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls saidon Friday: \"This credit rating downgrade is a humiliating blow to a prime minister and chancellor who said keeping our AAA rating was the test of their economic and political credibility.\" Moody's, the first of the major agencies to remove the UK from the elite club of AAA countries, blamed \"subdued growth\" and a \"high and rising debt burden\" for the decision to cut the rating by one notch to AA1. The rating is significant because it can affect a country's cost of borrowing and is also symbolic to governments determined to prove their economic credentials. Sterling may now be expected to come under pressure on foreign exchange markets. Osborne, who has often cited the importance of the triple-A status said: \"Tonight we have a stark reminder of the debt problems facing our country \u2013 and the clearest possible warning to anyone who thinks we can run away from dealing with those problems. Far from weakening our resolve to deliver our economic recovery plan, this decision redoubles it. We will go on delivering the plan that has cut the deficit by a quarter, and given us record low interest rates and record numbers of jobs.\" As far back as February 2010, he told an audience of Tory activists: \"What investor is going to come to the UK when they fear a downgrade of our credit rating and a collapse of confidence?\" In the Tory manifesto, published weeks later, he said: \"We will safeguard Britain's credit rating with a credible plan to eliminate the bulk of the structural deficit over a parliament.\" Balls said the decision by Moody's showed that chancellor was running out of credibility. \"George Osborne said keeping the credit rating was the key goal of his economic policy. As his economic plan has floundered, it has been the last thing he has clung on to. And bizarrely his response tonight suggests he is not reflecting on why things have gone so badly wrong, but using this downgrade as one more reason to plough on with his failing plan \u2013 regardless of the damaging impact on struggling families and businesses. The issue is no longer whether this chancellor can admit his mistakes but whether the prime minister can now see that, with UK economic policy so badly downgraded in every sense, things have got to change. \"In the budget the government must urgently take action to kickstart our flatlining economy and realise that we need growth to get the deficit down,\" he said. \"If David Cameron and George Osborne fail to do so and put political pride above the national economic interest, we face more long-term damage and pain for businesses and families.\" Moody's decision to cut the rating without awaiting the detail of Osborne's 20 March budget may surprise some economists, but it decided to move now because of the evidence of a \"high and rising debt burden\". With the UK one quarter away from a triple dip recession, Moody's blamed \"continuing weakness in the UK's medium term outlook with a period of sluggish growth which Moody's now expects will extend into the second half of the decade\". But it added that a \"combination of political will and medium term fundamental underlying economic strength will, in time, allow the government to implement its fiscal consolidation plan and reverse the UK's debt trajectory\". Moody's has now placed the UK rating on a \"stable footing\" but its rivals Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch have the country under review for a potential downgrade. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Treasury minister, told BBC News that losing the AAA rating was not a devastating blow and the government was getting Britain back on track. \"I would say this is disappointing news and that the credit rating agencies are one benchmark amongst many in terms of the economy, but actually our credibility as a country is tested every day in the financial markets,\" he said. \"We continue to command very low interest rates and also this country is continuing, despite all the difficulties and despite the fact that growth has been much slower than was originally forecast \u2026 to create jobs \u2013 a million jobs since we came into office.\" Lord Oakeshott, the Lib Dem peer and close ally of the business secretary Vince Cable, said he believes the markets have fallen because bank lending and housebuilding are \"flat on the floor\". \"If there is no change, the economy is going to remain being stuck. It matters most for him [George Osborne] because he was the one saying that before the election that it wouldn't happen,\" he said. \"The policies are not bold enough, they are not working, the economy is flat and I am afraid that the economy is just not working.\" As well as chiding the chancellor, Balls was critical of Moody's, and warned it was important not get carried away with what it or other ratings agencies said. \"Tonight's verdict does not change the fact that the credit rating agencies have made major misjudgments over recent years, not least in giving top ratings to US sub-prime mortgages before the global financial crash. \"But what matters is the economic reality that the credit rating agencies are responding to. Moody's themselves say the main driver of their decision is the weak growth in Britain's economy. \"Their judgment is in response to nearly three years of stagnation, a double-dip recession, billions more borrowing as confirmed this week and broken fiscal rules. This is why the chancellor is fast running out of credibility.\" This quarter is regarded as crucial for the chancellor if the country is to avoid a triple dip recession following the 2008 banking crisis which led to sharp reductions in growth in early 2009. The economy contracted by a surprise 0.3% in the last three months of 2012 and if it shrinks again in the subsequent three months it would be regarded as once again in recession. Employment, though, ended 2012 at 29.7m \u2013 the highest number of people in work since records began in 1971. Sterling had been jolted earlier in the week when it emerged that Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King had wanted to print more electronic money \u2013 quantitative easing \u2013 in an effort to bolster growth. In the last minutes of trading in New York on Friday, sterling was knocked down to $1.516, but is expected to come under pressure when Asian markets open for trading on Monday. Moody's also cut the central bank's rating last night. \"It's a pretty big deal. We didn't see a huge reaction in the pound because it's late in the New York session but you'll see some more aggressive selling when the market opens (in Asia) on Sunday,\" Kathy Lien, managing director of BK Asset Management in New York told Reuters.",

      "body": "<p>Britain was stripped of its AAA-rated debt status for the first time ever on Friday night in a move that puts pressure on George Osborne, who had pledged to use his austerity measures to protect the rating.</p> <p>The chancellor, who had 12 hours' notice of the decision by Moody's ratings agency, insisted he would stick to his course and had \"redoubled\" his resolve to tackle Britain's financial problems. However, the downgrading will have major political implications for the coalition.</p> <p>Labour and the Tories acknowledge that the next election is likely to be decided on the debate over the best way of fixing the economy. Osborne, however, will be forced to listen to a series of opposing politicians reminding him of his previous promises that he would maintain Britain's top rating. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls saidon Friday: \"This credit rating downgrade is a humiliating blow to a prime minister and chancellor who said keeping our AAA rating was the test of their economic and political credibility.\"</p> <p>Moody's, the first of the major agencies to remove the UK from the elite club of AAA countries, blamed \"subdued growth\" and a \"high and rising debt burden\" for the decision to cut the rating by one notch to AA1.</p> <p>The rating is significant because it can affect a country's cost of borrowing and is also symbolic to governments determined to prove their economic credentials. Sterling may now be expected to come under pressure on foreign exchange markets.</p> <p>Osborne, who has often cited the importance of the triple-A status said: \"Tonight we have a stark reminder of the debt problems facing our country \u2013 and the clearest possible warning to anyone who thinks we can run away from dealing with those problems. Far from weakening our resolve to deliver our economic recovery plan, this decision redoubles it. We will go on delivering the plan that has cut the deficit by a quarter, and given us record low interest rates and record numbers of jobs.\"</p> <p>As far back as February 2010, he told an audience of Tory activists: \"What investor is going to come to the UK when they fear a downgrade of our credit rating and a collapse of confidence?\" In the Tory manifesto, published weeks later, he said: \"We will safeguard Britain's credit rating with a credible plan to eliminate the bulk of the structural deficit over a parliament.\"</p> <p>Balls said the decision by Moody's showed that chancellor was running out of credibility. \"George Osborne said keeping the credit rating was the key goal of his economic policy. As his economic plan has floundered, it has been the last thing he has clung on to. And bizarrely his response tonight suggests he is not reflecting on why things have gone so badly wrong, but using this downgrade as one more reason to plough on with his failing plan \u2013 regardless of the damaging impact on struggling families and businesses. The issue is no longer whether this chancellor can admit his mistakes but whether the prime minister can now see that, with UK economic policy so badly downgraded in every sense, things have got to change.</p> <p>\"In the budget the government must urgently take action to kickstart our flatlining economy and realise that we need growth to get the deficit down,\" he said.</p> <p>\"If David Cameron and George Osborne fail to do so and put political pride above the national economic interest, we face more long-term damage and pain for businesses and families.\"</p> <p>Moody's decision to cut the rating without awaiting the detail of Osborne's 20&#xa0;March budget may surprise some economists, but it decided to move now because of the evidence of a \"high and rising debt burden\".</p> <p>With the UK one quarter away from a triple dip recession, Moody's blamed \"continuing weakness in the UK's medium term outlook with a period of sluggish growth which Moody's now expects will extend into the second half of the decade\".</p> <p>But it added that a \"combination of political will and medium term fundamental underlying economic strength will, in time, allow the government to implement its fiscal consolidation plan and reverse the UK's debt trajectory\".</p> <p>Moody's has now placed the UK rating on a \"stable footing\" but its rivals Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch have the country under review for a potential downgrade.</p> <p>Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Treasury minister, told BBC News that losing the AAA rating was not a devastating blow and the government was getting Britain back on track.</p> <p>\"I would say this is disappointing news and that the credit rating agencies are one benchmark amongst many in terms of the economy, but actually our credibility as a country is tested every day in the financial markets,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We continue to command very low interest rates and also this country is continuing, despite all the difficulties and despite the fact that growth has been much slower than was originally forecast \u2026 to create jobs \u2013 a million jobs since we came into office.\"</p> <p>Lord Oakeshott, the Lib Dem peer and close ally of the business secretary Vince Cable, said he believes the markets have fallen because bank lending and housebuilding are \"flat on the floor\".</p> <p>\"If there is no change, the economy is going to remain being stuck. It matters most for him [George Osborne] because he was the one saying that before the election that it wouldn't happen,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The policies are not bold enough, they are not working, the economy is flat and I am afraid that the economy is just not working.\"</p> <p>As well as chiding the chancellor, Balls was critical of Moody's, and warned it was important not get carried away with what it or other ratings agencies said.</p> <p>\"Tonight's verdict does not change the fact that the credit rating agencies have made major misjudgments over recent years, not least in giving top ratings to US sub-prime mortgages before the global financial crash.</p> <p>\"But what matters is the economic reality that the credit rating agencies are responding to. Moody's themselves say the main driver of their decision is the weak growth in Britain's economy.</p> <p>\"Their judgment is in response to nearly three years of stagnation, a double-dip recession, billions more borrowing as confirmed this week and broken fiscal rules. This is why the chancellor is fast running out of credibility.\"</p> <p>This quarter is regarded as crucial for the chancellor if the country is to avoid a triple dip recession following the 2008 banking crisis which led to sharp reductions in growth in early 2009.</p> <p>The economy contracted by a surprise 0.3% in the last three months of 2012 and if it shrinks again in the subsequent three months it would be regarded as once again in recession. Employment, though, ended 2012 at 29.7m \u2013 the highest number of people in work since records began in 1971.</p> <p>Sterling had been jolted earlier in the week when it emerged that Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King had wanted to print more electronic money \u2013 quantitative easing \u2013 in an effort to bolster growth. In the last minutes of trading in New York on Friday, sterling was knocked down to $1.516, but is expected to come under pressure when Asian markets open for trading on Monday. Moody's also cut the central bank's rating last night.</p> <p>\"It's a pretty big deal. We didn't see a huge reaction in the pound because it's late in the New York session but you'll see some more aggressive selling when the market opens (in Asia) on Sunday,\" Kathy Lien, managing director of BK Asset Management in New York told Reuters.</p>",
