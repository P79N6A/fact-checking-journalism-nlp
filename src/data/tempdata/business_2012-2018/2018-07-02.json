      "bodyText": "Multinational oil giant ExxonMobil has spent $10m fighting Australian tax authorities, including in disputes against the petroleum resources rent tax. ExxonMobil has faced persistent allegations over its tax affairs in Australia. The company has not paid corporate tax since 2013 and does not expect to do so until 2021. ExxonMobil says it is caught in a set of unique circumstances \u2013 caused by a large expenditure on capital investment and falling prices \u2013 which have left it without a taxable income. But a recent report by the Tax Justice Network exposed the links between the company\u2019s Australian operations and tax havens in the Bahamas and the Netherlands. Details have also emerged from a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance showing the company has spent a considerable amount on legal disputes with the Australian Taxation Office. In response to a question on notice, ExxonMobil estimated it had spent $10m on legal costs in the past 10 years relating to ATO cases. It said the \u201cbulk\u201d of that money had been spent on disputes over the petroleum resources rent tax, which were \u201cfully resolved by 2013\u201d. The company did not respond to requests for a more detailed breakdown on the $10m spend. Tax Justice Network\u2019s Jason Ward said the figure showed Australian taxpayers were footing the bill for legal battles with ExxonMobil, while the company itself paid little tax. Ward wrote the Tax Justice Network report that alleged the company used a complex web of subsidiaries and related party loans to shift profits and minimise tax. \u201cExxon\u2019s ability to extract our resources and exploit Australian workers while paying minimal tax is already widely known,\u201d Ward said. \u201cWhat we did not know is that Exxon has spent at least $10m fighting the ATO to keep it that way. \u201cExxon has barely paid a cent in corporate income tax since 2011 and won\u2019t pay for years to come, but Australian taxpayers have had to foot the bill to fight them in court.\u201d In March, ExxonMobil used the Senate inquiry to hit out at what it described as \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cinnuendo\u201d about its tax affairs. It said it had paid more than $2bn in tax since 2000, averaging $200m a year. Its contribution was particularly significant in the 1970s and 1980s, the company said, when it provided 14% of all government tax receipts. ExxonMobil said it had also paid $440m a year for the past 14 years through the petroleum resources rent tax. At the same inquiry, the company was accused of providing misleading information about its links to tax havens. Ward said the company had failed to disclose that its Australian operations were owned by entities in the Netherlands, a nation increasingly known for tax avoidance, and the Bahamas, a jurisdiction with no corporate tax that the European Union recently classed as a tax haven. ExxonMobil provided more transparency about the structure behind its Australian operations in the more recent response to questions on notice. It revealed the ownership chain behind ExxonMobil\u2019s Australian operations also involved two entities in Delaware, a US state well known as a tax secrecy jurisdiction. In April, the ATO was reported to have given amended claims to ExxonMobil, which focused on the interest rates charged on related-party loans.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs are driving up costs for US manufacturers and exacerbating a slowdown for eurozone factories, new figures showed on Monday, as the EU and the US edge closer towards a full-scale trade war with potentially damaging consequences for the global economy. According to the latest survey of American factories by IHS Markit \u2013 closely watched for any early warning signals for the world\u2019s largest economy \u2013 the president\u2019s tariffs added to the cost of raw materials and components in June. It also contributed to the lengthiest delays for supplies reaching factory production lines since the poll was started in 2007. Against the backdrop of an increasingly bitter dispute between the EU and the US, a parallel survey of eurozone manufacturers found economic activity dropped to the lowest level for 18 months in June, with the worst of the slowdown coming in Germany, France and Greece. The snapshot for the 19-nation bloc extended a period of slower growth for factories under way across the euro area since the start of this year. The survey also pointed towards tougher conditions ahead as Brussels and Washington exchange threats over import tariffs. The European commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, warned the White House on Monday it would be prepared to use tariffs against as much as $300bn (\u00a3228bn) of US products should Donald Trump slap higher taxes on European automotive imports to America. The president had threatened last month to impose tariffs of 20% on imports of cars from the EU after Brussels carried through plans to tax American consumer goods \u2013 such as whiskey, cigars and Harley-Davidson motorcycles \u2013 in retaliation against US tariffs on European steel and aluminium. The latest exchange in the trade standoff, alongside a trade dispute between the US and China, rocked financial markets on Monday as traders bet the conflict could escalate further, with the FTSE 100 closing down by 89 points, or 1.2%, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 list of the continent\u2019s leading shares declining 0.8%. Wall Street also fell in early trading on Monday, with the Dow Jones index falling 0.6%. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, said on Monday afternoon the turbulence would not deter Trump from shaking up the global trade system. \u201cAll these claims that the sky is falling are at least premature and probably inaccurate,\u201d he said in an interview with the CNBC news channel. The readings from the IHS Markit surveys suggest Trump\u2019s tariffs could push up the cost of goods for American consumers and buyers of goods made in the US. Survey respondents widely said higher input costs were partly passed on to clients. Factories in the eurozone bounced back from the sovereign debt crisis to record the strongest growth in a decade towards the end of last year, although activity has since come off the boil. British manufacturers, which have significant trading links to the continent, have suffered as a consequence. Lee Hopley, the chief economist at the EEF manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cWith the rest of the EU being a dominant source of growth over the past year, this slowdown, in part driven by fears about global trade tensions, could be a further signal of more weakness to come.\u201d IHS Markit said manufacturing output in the UK remained subdued in June, with factories increasingly reliant on backlogs of work rather than new orders. The threat of trade tariffs for Britain is compounded by political uncertainty over Brexit, while there are still lingering effects from higher UK inflation triggered by the EU referendum two years ago. Exporters on the continent are becoming increasingly worried about the potential impact of tariffs and other trade restrictions. The reading on the IHS Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index for the eurozone dropped to 54.9 in June from a reading of 55.5 in May, on a scale where anything above 50 points towards growth. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said political uncertainty was also having an impact on Italian factory output, although he added the biggest concern was cooling growth across the region and a potential trade war. \u201c[There are] mounting worries from companies relating to the impact of tariffs and trade wars, suggesting firms are bracing themselves for the potential for further export losses,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap. Worries over a potential trade war have weighed on market today, as factories report that America\u2019s recent move towards protectionism is hurting. Asian stock markets tumbled by around 2% overnight, triggering a selloff in Europe. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has just closed, down 89 points or nearly 1.2%. The French CAC shed 0.9%. The losses came after Donald Trump claimed that Europe was as bad as China when it came to trade. That has fuelled concerns that the US could impose tariffs on EU car imports. Europe has already fired a warning shot to Washington, saying it would impose retaliatory tariffs on $300bn of US sales into the EU. The US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has defended the White House\u2019s actions, insisting that the global trade system needed to be reformed. Ross also declared that the recent stock market volatility wouldn\u2019t force the administration to change its policies. David Madden of CMC Markets explainsays : The ongoing trade standoff between the US and China has triggered a wave of selling, as traders are fearful the tarifffs could hurt economic growth and bring about a slowdown. There are already signs that the prospect of a trade war is hurting growth. European factory growth slowed last month, with many bosses blaming uncertainty over tariffs for a drop in confidence. Data firm Markit reported that output and new order growth eased in June, while business optimism hit the lowest level this year. Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminium, and the prospect of action on Chinese imports, is also having an effect on American manufacturing. US factory bosses have reported a drop in confidence, and a big jump in input prices, as they await the president\u2019s next move. Back in the UK, UBS have warned that the pound could slide against the euro in the coming weeks, as the Brexit negotiations come to the boil. The US stock market is recovering some ground, but the Dow is still down 100 points (0.45%) today. ISM have also reported that every commodity got more expensive for US factories last month. That suggests that firms were scrambling to lay their hands on raw materials before a trade war breaks out. Here\u2019s our Brussels correspondent Jennifer Rankin on Europe\u2019s threat to retaliate against America if Trump delivers on his threat to impose 20% tariffs on EU car imports. Donald Trump will put a \u201ctax on the American people\u201d if he goes ahead with a threat to hit European carmakers with punitive tariffs, the European Unionhas warned. In a hard-hitting paper, the European commission said Trump\u2019s tariffs would be \u201cself-defeating and would weaken the US economy\u201d, estimating that almost $300bn (\u00a3228bn) worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. The warning comes in the commission\u2019s first detailed response to the US department of commerce following Trump\u2019s threat to hit imports of European cars with tariffs. \u201cThe European Union is possibly as bad as China, only smaller,\u201d the US president told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cThey send a Mercedes in, we can\u2019t send our cars in,\u201d he claimed. The EU imposes a 10% tariff on US-built cars, while the US levies a 2.5% tariff on cars assembled in Europe and a 25% tariff on European-built vans and pick-up trucks. More here: The US Institute of Supply Management has also reported that tariffs are having a negative effect on American factories. ISM\u2019s survey of US manufacturing found that factories are finding it harder to get supplies delivered on time. That suggests that recent curbs on steel and aluminium imports are already having an effect (echoing what Markit reported a few minute earlier) Timothy Fiore, chairman of the ISM Business Survey Committee, says that trade war fears are weighing on the sector. He says: \u201cLead-time extensions, steel and aluminum disruptions, supplier labor issues, and transportation difficulties continue. Demand remains robust, but the nation\u2019s employment resources and supply chains continue to struggle. Respondents are overwhelmingly concerned about how tariff related activity is and will continue to affect their business.\u201d Despite these concerns, ISM reports that American manufacturing grew at the fastest pace in four months in June. Newsflash: American factories are also feeling the impact of Donald Trump\u2019s trade dispute. Data firm Markit has just reported that US manufacturing growth hit a four-month low last month. New order growth slowed to the lowest rate since November 2017, which American factory bosses blamed on recent tariffs. US purchasing managers also reported that input prices kept climbing last month. This was due to \u201cgreater global demand for inputs and the effects of recent tariffs\u201d, Markit says. This pulled the US manufacturing PMI down to 55.4 in June, down from 56.4 in May (so showing slower growth). Donald Trump has argued that US manufacturing will benefit from his actions, as companies will be encouraged to seek domestic alternatives to imported goods (once they incur an extra tariffs). But Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says tariffs are having a negative effect on the sector: Business optimism about the year ahead also fell to the lowest since January, with survey respondents worried in particular about the potential impact of trade wars and tariffs. \u201cTariffs were widely blamed on a further marked rise in input costs, and also linked to worsening supply chain delays \u2013 which hit the highest on record, exacerbating existing tight supply conditions.\u201d DING DING: Wall Street has joined the global selloff at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 180 points, or 0.75%, at the open to 24,085 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 is also down around 0.7%. US traders are concerned that the trade dispute between the US and Europe appears to be deepening, with president Trump claiming that the EU was \u201cas bad as China\u201d. The big concern is that Trump may decide to impose tariffs on imports of cars from Europe (as he threatened last month). The news that the EU has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on $300bn of US imports suggests that tit-for-tat tariffs could hurt economic growth. The US commerce secretary has insisted that market volatility won\u2019t deter Donald Trump from shaking up the global trade system. In an interview with CNBC, Wilbur Ross said the US president was determined to push through changes - even if it creates uncertainty that drags stock markets down. Ross argued that the US economy is in good shape, with strong capital expenditure and employment growth - and more jobs available than unemployed people to fill them. All these claims that the sky is falling are at least premature and probably inaccurate. Q: But, the markets have fallen in recent weeks as the trade disputes have gathered pace.... Ross suggests the White House isn\u2019t concerned -- especially as US stocks have risen so sharply since Trump won the 2016 presidential election. The stock market hates uncertainty, business hates uncertainty, everyone hates uncertainty. The worst fear is the first of the unknown. But in the end arithmetic prevails, facts prevail, and fears are either realised or they go away. Q: What if the stock market fell 20% from its highs (the definition of a Bear Market)? Ross is adamant that there\u2019s no \u201cbright line level\u201d that would force a change of policy. The president is trying to fix long-term problems that should have been dealt with a long time ago. Obviously there will be some pushing and tugging as we try to deal with very serious problems. There will be some hiccups along the way. Ross also played down reports that Trump might yank America out of the WTO. He argues that the WTO itself understands that some reforms are needed, so it\u2019s \u201cpremature\u201d to talk about withdrawing from the whole agreement. Over in Athens the Bank of Greece has released its much-awaited monetary policy report on the state of the economy following last month\u2019s key debt-relief package. The report - handed to the Greek parliament this morning - says the agreement reached with euro zone creditors on June 21 offers debt sustainability in the medium term but over the longer term only further reforms and more relief would guarantee it continued. The warning echoed similar concerns expressed by the International Monetary Fund last week. But while the Bank insisted that Greece should take stock of a precautionary credit line once it exits its last international rescue programme in August, it also said the debt relief deal would facilitate the country\u2019s return to the capital markets from which it has been excluded for the best part of a decade. Accessing markets again would be \u201cthe last and decisive indication that the Greek economy had surpassed the crisis,\u201d it said. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led coalition is bitterly against agreeing to a credit line that would be perceived to compromise the country\u2019s \u2018clean exit\u2019 from bailout oversight. In the report, the Bank of Greece governor, Yiannis Stournaras, said he foresaw growth rates of 2% and 2.3% for this year and next. The pound is flat against the euro today, at \u20ac1.13, meaning one euro is worth around 88.5p. But Brexit uncertainty is still swirling, as Theresa May tries to devise a customs deal which her cabinet can support (and which the EU will accept). UBS Global Wealth Management have advised clients to buy the euro against the pound, predicting that sterling will slide in the weeks ahead - especially if negotiations with Brussels fail to make progress. Dean Turner, their UK economist, explains: \u201cWe\u2019ve long been advocates that economics not politics should drive markets. However, the current stalemate between the UK and Europe on a Brexit deal cannot be overlooked. In the near future, it is not just events in Threadneedle Street that will matter. Downing Street will be equally important in the minds of markets. \u201cBusinesses have been fairly resilient in the face of Brexit uncertainty, but they may not stand for much more. If the negotiations drag on we expect confidence in a transition deal to wane. This poses a tangible risk to the economy. \u201cWe expect there to be a drag on sterling in the coming months as the Brexit back and forth continues.\u201d There\u2019s no sign of a big breakthrough yet. Instead, Brussels officials say they\u2019re unimpressed by the UK\u2019s latest efforts to maintain close ties to the EU while also restricting migration. More here: Worries over trade wars are pushing many currencies down today, as traders seek the safety of the US dollar. The pound is down half a cent against the dollar at $1.315, while the euro has lost a similar amount to trade around $1.163. Emerging market currencies are also suffering; the Indian rupee hit its lowest level since 2013 against the dollar today. It\u2019s been a bad year for many emerging market currencies; the rupee, the ruble and the yuan are all down in 2018 (the Turkish lira and the Argentinian peso have really slumped, but partly for non trade-war reasons....) Over in California, Tesla\u2019s employees should have enjoyed a good night\u2019s sleep after finally hitting their production targets. The electric carmaker succeeded in churning out 5,000 of its Model 3 model last week, after a major push which saw founder Elon Musk spend his birthday on the production line. It was all worth it, though, as Musk told staff that : \u201cWe did it! What an incredible job by an amazing team.\u201d Musk also tweeted about his jubilation.... ...and found himself gently teased by the European boss of Ford: Ford do have rather a headstart in car production, of course... The price of copper has hit its lowest level since late March, as investors fear that tariffs are hurting economic growth. Reuters has the details: Benchmark copper was down 0.5% at $6,585 a tonne at 1040 GMT from an earlier $6,550 a tonne, its lowest since March 26. Prices of the metal used widely in power and construction have tumbled 10 percent since June 7. \u201cInvestors are taking risk off the table because of trade tensions, which threaten Chinese exports to the United State sand also their profit margins,\u201d said SP Angel analyst John Meyer. \u201cIndustrial metals rely on China.\u201d The selloff is partly due to this morning\u2019s factory data, showing that Chinese factories suffered a drop in export orders last month. The US stock market is expected to drop when trading begins in three and a half hours, following the lead from Asia and Europe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is being called down 167 points, or 0.7% while the S&amp;P 400 is expected to drop 16 points or 0.5%. Back the markets, shares continue to be buffeted by trade war worries. The main European indices are all in the red, after Donald Trump and the EU both raised the ante in their ongoing tariff dispute. This follows those heavy losses in Asia, where major markets lost over 2% Here\u2019s the damage: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100: down 77 points, or 1%, at 7,558 French CAC: down 53 points or 1% at 5,270 German DAX: down 55 points or 0.5% at 12,250 Fiona Cincotta of City Index says markets are also suffering from the news that Canada has slapped tariffs on US imports (in retaliation for Donald Trump\u2019s earlier actions). She explains: From Sunday Canada started imposing trade tariffs on $12.6 billion worth of American goods including iron, orange juice and whiskey in response to the US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium which were introduced on 22 June. America\u2019s northern neighbour joins the ranks of the EU and Mexico, both of which have also hit back against US import tariffs with tariffs of their own, with Mexico penalising imports of US pork, steel, cheese and apples and the EU levying duties on whiskey, motorcycles and orange juice. Amid the trade whirlwind investors are now increasingly looking for stocks that will be the least effected by the tariff tit-for-tat although it is difficult to say what these stocks may be given that Donald Trump has already said he intends to respond with another set of trade tariffs in response to his trade partners\u2019 reaction. Finally, some good news. Unemployment across the eurozone is its lowest since the financial crisis began a decade ago. The euro-area jobless rate was 8.4% in May, statistics body Eurostat reports, matching April\u2019s figure. It\u2019s the lowest reading since December 2008. In the wider EU, unemployment was a healthier 7.0% - the best since August 2008, shortly before the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a global downturn. Encouragingly, unemployment has fallen in every eurozone country in the last 12 months. But there are still wide disparities in the region. Eurostat says: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates in May 2018 were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.3%) and Germany (3.4%). The highest unemployment rates were observed in Greece (20.1% in March 2018) and Spain (15.8%). Economists are concerned by this morning\u2019s factory growth figures from the UK and the eurozone. Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst says there is weakness at the heart of the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector: Growth is lower as manufacturing business rely on backlogs and inventory building to keep machines working, something that cannot continue for too much longer. Similarly, businesses are passing on higher costs to customers but there will be a limit as to how much those customers can or will take. Risks for the sector remain in everything from the weakness of sterling, the threat of trade tariffs and more difficult international trade terms, Brexit and those higher input prices from commodity markets. The trend in UK manufacturing is one of weakness and this figure confirms that fact.\u201d Ms Lee Hopley, chief economist at manufacturing group EEF, is concerned that factory growth slowed across Europe last month: With the rest of the EU being a dominant source of growth over the past year this slowdown, in part driven by fears about global trade tensions, could be a further signal of more weakness to come.\u201d Lee McDarby, Corporate IP Managing Director at moneycorp, thinks Brexit is making companies too nervous to invest right now: \u201cIn normal times we would expect the weak pound, especially against the Dollar, to have translated into higher manufacturing growth. These are not normal times, however. The weakness of sterling is reflective of investor concern about Brexit and the strength of the UK economy and it could be that these same concerns are holding back manufacturers from investing in growth Newsflash: factory growth in Britain remained steady last month, but bosses are getting gloomier. Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI has come in at 54.4 this morning, slightly up on May\u2019s 54.3 (reminder, any reading over 50 shows growth). But the survey also found that new order growth remained subdued, meaning companies relied on existing business and inventory building to keep their staff busy. Markit says: Although the rate of increase in new business edged up to a three-month high, it remained among the weakest registered over the past year- and-a-half. Business optimism also dropped last month, to a seven-month low, Markit adds. Some firms expressed concerns about input price increases, possible future trade tariffs, the exchange rate and Brexit uncertainty. Newsflash: eurozone factory growth has slowed to an 18-month low - another sign that trade war fears are hurting the economy. Data firm Markit reports that output and new order growth at European firms has slowed this year, and that factory bosses are more pessimistic about future business. This has dragged Markit\u2019s eurozone manufacturing PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, down to 54.9 from 55.5 in May. That\u2019s the weakest reading since the start of 2017, and closer to the 50-point mark that shows stagnation. According to Markit, factory production grew at the slowest pace since November 2016 while new business growth was the weakest since August 2016. This pulled business optimism down to its lowest level in over two-and-a-half years. The survey also found that France is lagging behind other eurozone nations: Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, is particularly concerned that exports orders remain subdued: The biggest concern is the extent to which export order book growth has cooled since the start of the year, and could soon go into decline. The survey reveals mounting worries from companies relating to the impact of tariffs and trade wars, suggesting firms are bracing themselves for the potential for further export losses. Not surprisingly, business expectations for future production deteriorated in June to the lowest November 2015. City economist Paul Donovan of UBS isn\u2019t impressed by Trump\u2019s claim that Europe is \u201cas bad as China\u201d when it comes to trade. He says: US President Trump sounded upset about Europeans selling Americans things Americans want to buy. The Financial Times reports the EU is threatening to tax a fifth of US exports if the US imposes taxes on consumption of EU autos and auto parts. That would be a trade war. US carmakers are lobbying against the proposed US taxes, showing that tariffs are an outdated concept. July has started in a \u201ctroubled mood\u201d, says Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx, as he watches the main European markets slide into the red. Campbell blames the trade war fears that are rippling through trading floors today: Trump kicked off July by targeting the EU, not China, saying that the region was \u2018possibly as bad\u2019 as Beijing in how it treats the US, \u2018just smaller\u2019. This has sent the President\u2019s previous threat of tariffs on EU car imports back to the top of investors\u2019 \u2018To Fear\u2019 lists, with the added spice of a report from the Financial Times suggesting the European Union could respond in kind with tariffs of $300 billion on US products. Financial stocks are also having a bad morning. The Stoxx 600 banks index, which tracks Europe\u2019s largest banks, has dropped by 1.9% in the first few minutes of trading. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has fallen by 72 points, or almost 1%, at the start of trading. That takes the blue-chip index of top shares down to 7574 points. Mining companies are leading the selloff, with Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton both down over 2%. That reflects the fact that demand for iron ore, coal, nickel, copper and oil will all fall if Europe and America hit each other with tit-for-tat tariffs. Other European markets have also opened in the red, with the German DAX shedding 1.3% at the open. Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at trading firm ADSS, says Investors are worried about the stalemate in discussions within Angela Merkel\u2019s Germany coalition government and Trump\u2019s intention to slap China with more tariffs. In a worrying sign, Chinese factories are suffering from falling export orders. Data firm Caixin has reported that new export sales at Chinese manufacturing firms shrank last month, for the third month in a row. That may be a signal that Trump\u2019s tariffs are already hurting global trade. Caixin also flagged up that Chinese factories are shedding jobs, as some don\u2019t have enough work lined up. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, explains: The index for new export orders fell to a low for the year so far and remained in contraction territory, pointing to a grim export situation amid escalating trade disputes between China and the U.S., which led to weak demand across the manufacturing sector. Asian stock markets are a sea of red today, as traders fret about the prospect of a global trade war. Every major share index is in the red, and many emerging market currencies are sliding against the US dollar again. Donald Trump\u2019s claim yesterday that Europe was treating the US unfairly has helped to drive markets down. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group says Europe\u2019s threat to impose fresh tariffs on American goods has also alarmed investors: A ramping up of trade war headlines over the weekend, such as a strong warning of retaliation from the EU and a potential currency war with China (US), will ensure that the fear of an all out global trade war is central in trader\u2019s mind, as the session begins on Monday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The second half of the financial year is beginning where the first half left off, with rising anxiety over a trade war. Overnight, Donald Trump has launched a fresh attack on the European Union, claiming it treated the US very badly and was \u201cpossibly as bad as China, just smaller\u201d. Speaking on Fox News, the US president declared: \u201cLook what they do to our farmers, they don\u2019t want our farm products. In all fairness they have their farmers so they want to protect their farmers. \u201cBut we don\u2019t protect ours and they protect theirs.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments raise the prospect that the US could impose further tariffs on EU imports - possibly on car imports (something he threatened last month). Europe isn\u2019t taking Trump\u2019s sledging lying down, though. According to the Financial Times, the EU has threatened to retaliate with tariffs on up to $300bn of US products, if the US does indeed penalise EU carmakers. The threat of retaliatory tariffs on US imports into Europe came in a written submission to the US Department of Commerce, outlining how the bloc would respond to Trump\u2019s threats. The FT\u2019s Jim Brunsden explains: Brussels said that an American investigation into whether foreign cars and parts posed a national security risk could plunge the global economy into a full-on trade war, harming employment in the US\u2019s auto sector, which accounts for more than 4m jobs. In a sign of the EU\u2019s exasperation at Mr Trump\u2019s confrontational trade policy, which has already stoked tensions over steel and aluminium, the document said the move \u201ccould result in yet another disregard of international law\u201d by the US. It said imposing the car tariffs would not be accepted by the international community and would \u201cdamage further the reputation\u201d of the US. This has already sparked a selloff in Asia, where Japan\u2019s Nikkei and China\u2019s CSI 300 index have both shed 2%. European markets are set for losses at the open too, with the FTSE 100 called down 50 points. Also coming up today Data firm Markit is publishing its latest Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) reports, showing how manufacturing companies across the world fared last month. They\u2019ll show whether the threat of a global trade war has hurt factories. And in Germany, Angela Merkel is still locked in battle with her CSU coalition over migration. Last night, the country\u2019s interior minister reportedly announced his intention to resign - a move that could bring down the Chancellor\u2019s increasingly shaky coalition. Merkel and Horst Seehofer are due to hold fresh talks this afternoon, so the great survivor of European politics could yet see off another crisis. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9am BST: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for June 9.30am BST: UK manufacturing PMI for June 10am BST: Eurozone unemployment figures for May 3pm BST: US manufacturing PMI for June",

      "bodyText": "Tesco and Carrefour, Britain\u2019s biggest grocer and Europe\u2019s largest retailer, have increased the pressure on supermarket suppliers by teaming up to buy products for more than 19,000 stores \u2013 a move they claim will lead to greater choice and lower prices for customers. Analysts said the planned three-year strategic alliance between two retail powerhouses would squeeze suppliers further as the supermarket industry fights back against the rise of Amazon and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. Tesco and its French peer Carrefour will buy own-brand products together and attempt to secure better deals from multinationals such as the Nescaf\u00e9 maker Nestl\u00e9 and Unilever, which makes Persil and Marmite. Tesco and Carrefour said they aim to improve the quality and choice of products in their supermarkets and sell them at cheaper prices. Each company will continue to work with their suppliers at a local and national level. The Tesco chief executive and former Unilever executive, Dave Lewis, said: \u201cBy working together and making the most of our collective product expertise and sourcing capability, we will be able to serve our customers even better.\u201d The strategy could lead to more camembert, wine and other French products being sold in Tesco stores and more British products in Carrefour supermarkets, although details have yet to be finalised, according to a Tesco spokeswoman. Both retailers are under pressure because Amazon has moved into traditional grocery retailing with the acquisition of Whole Foods and launched an online delivery service, Fresh, in the UK last year. Sainsbury\u2019s has made it clear that if its proposed takeover of Asda is given the go-ahead from competition regulators, it will target its biggest suppliers for cost reductions by flexing its increased buying power. \u201cTesco and Carrefour will look to do the same while reducing the number of branded products they sell as they increase their own-brand ranges,\u201d Patrick O\u2019Brien, the UK retail research director at GlobalData, said. \u201cFor suppliers, this is another signal of battles ahead.\u201d Analysts at Jefferies estimate the combined buying power of Tesco and Carrefour at more than \u00a380bn annually. They believe the groups could reap total savings of \u00a3400m from the alliance. Philip Benton, a research consultant at Euromonitor International, added: \u201cTesco may also see this as a safeguarding of risk against possible supplier price rises in the event of a hard Brexit.\u201d Under the alliance, to be formally agreed within the next two months, Tesco and Carrefour could also reduce their costs by clubbing together to buy petrol for delivery vans as well as functions such as legal services and accounting. Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: \u201cAn entente cordiale between the two giants of British and French retailing is yet another sign that squeezing the cost base is the biggest priority for supermarkets as they seek to contain the discounters and protect margins. \u201cOn both sides of the Channel, rising costs are putting pressure on margins. Meanwhile, every retailer is looking over their shoulder at Amazon and the potential disruption it could still cause in the grocery sector.\u201d Carrefour is slashing thousands of jobs and other costs, and ramping up digital investment after profits fell for the second year in a row. Tesco has fared better recently, recording its strongest sales growth in seven years, bolstered by its acquisition of the Booker wholesaler, but it remains under pressure from the German discounters Aldi and Lidl. According to Euromonitor International, a combined Carrefour and Tesco will hold an 8% of the western European grocery market, ahead of Lidl\u2019s owner on 6% and Aldi Group on 5%. Carrefour makes the bulk of its \u20ac79bn (\u00a370bn) worth of sales in Europe and Brazil while Tesco operates in Britain, Ireland, eastern Europe, Malaysia and Thailand, and has a wholesale presence in India. The independent retail analyst Natalie Berg tweeted: \u201cInteresting collaboration. Buying alliances are common in Europe but unusual to see two of the largest global food retailers join forces. Everyone\u2019s choosing sides before Amazon strikes.\u201d Referring to fast-moving consumer goods, she added: \u201cFMCG suppliers can\u2019t seem to catch a break \u2013 supermarket consolidation, Amazon stepping up private label efforts and now a buying alliance between two of the world\u2019s largest food retailers.\u201d O\u2019Brien, at GlobalData, said: \u201cTesco is obviously concerned by the increased potential buying scale of a combined Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda, and both it and Carrefour are worried by the idea of Amazon making more ambitious moves in European grocery retail. \u201cHowever, it should be noted that a key focus of the tie-up is to reduce prices on own-brand products and this is more of a direct response to Aldi and Lidl, whose offers are heavily weighted towards own-brand. Tesco and Carrefour have both struggled to match the discounters on quality and price, and the alliance should help it compete.\u201d Tesco Chief executive Dave Lewis Number of employees worldwide 440,000 Annual revenues \u00a351bn (\u00a364.5bn estimated post-Booker) Annual profits \u00a31.6bn Number of countries 10 Number of stores 6,800 Carrefour Chief executive Alexandre Bompard Number of employees worldwide 379,000 Annual revenues \u20ac79bn Annual profits \u20ac2bn Number of countries 33 Number of stores 12,300",

Previously, the bank, which employs 48,700 people in the UK, said it would be expanding its operations in Dublin by 150-200 jobs, making Ireland its base for continuing to trade within the EU. But it has emerged that some of those jobs will be based in Frankfurt, although technically the individuals would be employed by the Irish unit, according to a report from Reuters.

The shift will allow Barclays to continue trading in euros with European clients even if the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 with no trade deal or transition agreement. The Barclays chief executive, Jes Staley, said last year that he saw no reason to shift many British jobs to Europe as a result of Brexit and described the restructuring required leaving the EU as straightforward compared with other challenges faced by the bank.

There has been intense speculation about the number of jobs that will be lost in the finance industry, which currently employs 1.1 million people in the UK, as a result of Brexit. Initial forecasts were for about 10,000 job losses, but in March a Reuters poll of 119 finance firms found that the eventual reduction may be only half that number.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump will put a \u201ctax on the American people\u201d if he goes ahead with a threat to hit European carmakers with punitive tariffs, the European Union has warned. In a hard-hitting paper, the European commission said Trump\u2019s tariffs would be \u201cself-defeating and would weaken the US economy\u201d, estimating that almost $300bn (\u00a3228bn) worth of US goods could be hit by countermeasures. The warning comes in the commission\u2019s first detailed response to the US department of commerce following Trump\u2019s threat to hit imports of European cars with tariffs. \u201cThe European Union is possibly as bad as China, only smaller,\u201d the US president told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cThey send a Mercedes in, we can\u2019t send our cars in,\u201d he claimed. The EU imposes a 10% tariff on US-built cars, while the US levies a 2.5% tariff on cars assembled in Europe and a 25% tariff on European-built vans and pick-up trucks. The US leader promised to unleash tariffs on European car imports after the EU retaliated against his tariffs on steel and aluminium, sparking fears of a trade war that pushed stock markets around the world into the red on Monday. In a sign of the EU\u2019s deepening alarm about Trump\u2019s unilateral approach, the paper argues that the White House is again risking the US\u2019s international reputation. \u201cThe European Union would therefore caution the United States against pursuing a process which could result in yet another disregard of international law, which would damage further the reputation of the United States and which the international community cannot and will not accept.\u201d EU leaders who met the US president at a tense G7 summit in Canada were rattled by Trump\u2019s disregard for the post-1945 world order, his mocking tone and bellicose rhetoric. That summit did lead to an invitation from the White House to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, to visit Washington. Juncker is due to meet Trump in Washington before the end of July, a Brussels spokesman confirmed on Monday. Speaking last month about his recent encounter with the US president, Juncker said Trump had told him: \u201cJean-Claude \u2013 you are a brutal killer.\u2019\u201d Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, added: \u201cI think he meant it as a compliment but I am not sure.\u201d According to the commission analysis, European carmakers in the US produce 2.9m cars, about 26% of US production, supporting 120,000 US manufacturing jobs and 420,000 dealership jobs. EU-owned companies in the US export 60% of their production, helping the country\u2019s trade balance, the paper states. Some European observers expect Trump to announce his decision on car tariffs before the midterm elections in November, in a bid to boost the chances of Republican candidates running for Congress and in state elections. The US commerce department is due to hold hearings on car tariffs in July and expected to complete its investigation into car imports later this summer. European carmakers are worried that escalating measures will play havoc with global supply chains, damaging companies on both sides of the Atlantic. \u201cI am hoping that when \u2026 it becomes very obvious that even US industry doesn\u2019t want this, that that would give pause for thought and perhaps a reconsideration of the measures,\u201d Jonathan O\u2019Riordan, the international trade director at the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, said. \u201cHowever, we are concerned.\u201d In its latest paper, the EU steps up its criticism of the US for using national security as the reason for sanctions, asserting that this argument is baseless and \u201charms trade, growth and jobs in the US and abroad, weakens the bonds with friends and allies, and shifts the attention away from the shared strategic challenges that genuinely threaten the market-based western economic model\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Supplies of carbon dioxide (CO2) may not return to normal levels for another two to three weeks \u2013 triggering likely shortages of meat for UK shoppers \u2013 the processing industry has warned. The production of crumpets, beer, fizzy drinks, fresh chicken and pork have been affected by shortages of CO2 over the past two weeks, amid longer than expected shutdowns at ammonia and ethanol plants \u2013 key producers of the gas \u2013 in the UK and also across Europe. Three out of five key UK CO2 producers have been shut down, hitting the country particularly hard, although one of them \u2013 a plant in Billingham, County Durham \u2013 reopened on Monday. CO2 is used to kill farm animals and also to extend the shelf life of fresh meat and poultry in vacuum-sealed packaging. Demand for fresh meat for barbecues has soared because of the hot June weather. Nick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association, said the CO2 shortage was continuing to cause considerable disruption throughout the meat supply chain and could take two to three weeks for supplies to return to normal. \u201cWe are hoping that the increase in CO2 production will happen quickly,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe have a number of plants that will be in difficulty by the end of the week if supplies do not materialise and it will be very difficult to keep everyone stocked with meat. We are still expecting plants to be experiencing problems over the next two to three weeks until normal supplies are fully restored.\u201d Allen said some plants were having to improvise \u2013 for example by changing packaging methods \u2013 to ensure that the consumers do not face shortages in shops and restaurants. Amid calls for ministers to intervene in the growing crisis, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was due to hold a meeting of the food chain emergency liaison group on Monday at which affected government departments, industry and trade associations will share relevant information. Over the weekend, the supermarket giant Asda said it was limiting the amount of fizzy soft drinks people could buy. It has restricted shoppers to six bottles or multipacks of soft drinks online. However, in a boost for football fans and beer drinkers, the pub chain JD Wetherspoon said its supplies were nearly back to normal and it would be business as usual before England\u2019s World Cup match on Tuesday evening. The pub chain, which had been unable to serve some beers and ciders on draft, said the situation should be resolved by Tuesday morning \u2013 only hours before England\u2019s knockout showdown against Colombia. A spokesman said: \u201cA high number of our pubs had been unable to serve three products on draft \u2013 John Smith\u2019s, Strongbow and Strongbow Dark Fruit. Supplies of these products across all of the company\u2019s pubs is almost back to normal and the issue is set to be resolved by Tuesday morning. So in effect we are getting back to normal and no more issues are expected.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The pub chain Wetherspoon is backing a campaign to raise awareness of discrimination that Gypsies and Travellers face in accessing bars and restaurants. The company previously admitted that Travellers had been racially stereotyped by staff in its pubs. In 2015, Wetherspoon paid out \u00a33,500 each to three people after staff at its Cambridge pub the Tivoli barred them from entering because of their ethnicity. The same year, the pub was ordered to pay \u00a324,000 damages after being found guilty of racially discriminating against a group of Travellers in November 2011, when they were prevented from entering the Coronet pub in north London. On Monday, Tim Martin, the founder and chairman of Wetherspoon, said he had met with representatives of the Traveller Movement \u2013 a charity that provides support to the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community in the UK \u2013 to discuss the issue. \u201cWe were pleased to welcome representatives from the Traveller Movement and Equality and Human Rights Commission at our head office. We have been working closely with them in developing our employee training on this issue and support the campaign,\u201d he said. Jim Davies, equality and social justice unit manager for the Traveller Movement, said: \u201cBeing refused entry or service is a problem which blights the lives of Gypsy and Traveller people throughout the country. \u201cThis form of discrimination should not be tolerated in any civilised society, so it is heartening to see that an industry leader such as Wetherspoon is taking such a positive stance on the matter. The Traveller Movement commends Wetherspoon for their efforts in raising awareness of this issue.\u201d In the wake of the discrimination claims in 2015, Wetherspoons said it was carrying out a review of its training and policies to make sure staff complied with legal requirements. Martin said the two cases were the only occasions on which the company had been accused of discrimination against Travellers since the chain was founded in 1979.",

      "bodyText": "More than 150 estate agency firms went insolvent last year and as many as 7,000 are at risk as high street operators face the triple whammy of online competition, a sagging property market and cuts to letting fees. A study by accountants Moore Stephens found that 153 estate agency firms went insolvent in the year to May 2018, a small increase on the 148 the year before. But it found that more than 7,000 estate agents \u201ccurrently show signs of financial distress\u201d. Last week, shares in Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent, Countrywide Properties, plunged 25% after it issued its fourth profit warning in eight months and called on shareholders to raise fresh funds to cut its debt. Countrywide, the company behind Hamptons, Bairstow Eves, Taylors and Gascoigne-Pees, has been hit hard by a downturn in the housing market in London and the south-east, a botched revamp of the business and growing competition from new online firms such as Purplebricks. Estate agents focused on the Brexit-hit London property market have been among the worst affected. Earlier this year Foxtons reported a 65% fall in profits. Moore Stephens said government plans to ban letting fees charged to tenants may narrow the profit margins of some estate agents even more, as fees from tenants currently contribute significantly to the bottom line. Estate agents rely on transaction activity rather than rising house prices to earn commission, and have been hit hard by the 20% fall in the number of property sales in the London area since 2014. The extra stamp duty surcharge of 3% of the value of a buy-to-let home introduced in April 2016 has also added to the woes of estate agents, with some buy-to-let investors choosing not to add to their portfolios. Chris Marsden, restructuring partner at Moore Stephens, said: \u201cInsolvencies of high street estate agents are increasing as online competitors continue to chip away at their sales. \u201cWith the ban on letting fees stated to come into force in 2019, estate agents will struggle to pass those fees on to landlords.\u201d \u201cSome areas in the UK are appear to have an excess capacity of estate agents, which could mean there is not enough business to spread around as property transactions stagnate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The boss of one of the world\u2019s biggest energy companies has said governments should abandon expensive \u201cmoonshot\u201d green technologies \u2013 such as the \u00a31.3bn Swansea tidal project, axed last week \u2013 in favour of wind and solar. Ignacio S Galan, chair of Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, which controls Scottish Power in the UK, said the decision on Swansea must see the end of support for what he described as unproven technologies that are a distraction and waste of resources. \u201cNow is not the time for expensive \u2018moonshot\u2019 projects that do little to make renewables more affordable, while possessing only limited potential for global growth,\u201d Galan said. \u201cIt is time to put a line in the sand. We should accept that some renewable technologies will never get to a level where they can compete with wind and solar.\u201d While investing small amounts to drive down new technology costs was acceptable, high spending on ideas unproven at scale was wasting time in the fight against climate change, he said. Wind and solar deserved government support because they had already come down drastically in cost, and would continue to do so, Galan said. Iberdrola is a major player in solar and onshore wind, but has been frustrated by the UK blocking onshore windfarms from competing for renewables subsidies. The firm is also building offshore windfarms in Britain. But a spokesperson for Tidal Lagoon Power, the company behind the proposed Swansea scheme, said tidal lagoons could prove cost competitive. \u201cHaving once bemoaned the incumbency of fossil fuels, it\u2019s disappointing that some in the renewables sector have adopted this bad habit,\u201d they said. New research has found that the UK government\u2019s stance of blocking support for onshore windfarms and solar, and only backing offshore windfarms, will be more expensive and result in higher carbon emissions. Analysts at Aurora Energy Research said that subsidising a mix of the three sources would be \u00a3210m-\u00a3330m cheaper than solely pursuing offshore windfarms. Lord Deben, chair of the government\u2019s statutory climate advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, criticised the exclusion of onshore windfarms. \u201cTo spend more because the government won\u2019t do the low-cost alternative seems to me unacceptable,\u201d he said.",
