      "bodyText": "The standoff between Greece and its creditors has escalated, with the embattled Athens government vowing it will not give in to demands for further cuts as data showed the country\u2019s economy unexpectedly contracting. As thousands of protesting farmers rallied in Athens over spiralling costs and unpopular reforms, the Hellenic statistical authority revealed that Greek GDP shrank by 0.4% in the last three months of 2016. After growth of 0.9% in the previous three-month period the fall was steep and unforeseen. On Monday the European commission announced that the eurozone\u2019s weakest member was on course to achieving a surplus on its budget of 2.3% after exceeding its 2016 fiscal targets \u201csignificantly\u201d. The setback came as prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 lefist-led coalition said it would not consent to additional austerity beyond the cuts the country had already agreed to administer under its third, EU-led bailout programme. Speaking on state TV, the digital policy minister Nikos Pappas, Tsipras\u2019 closest confidant, insisted that ongoing differences between the EU and International Monetary Fund over how to put the debt-stricken state back on the road to recovery were squarely to blame for the failure to conclude a compliance review at the heart of the standoff. The IMF has argued vigorously that extra measures worth 2% of GDP will have to be enforced with immediate effect if Greece is to achieve a high post-programme primary surplus of more than 1.5%. \u201cThe negotiations should have ended. Greece has done everything that it was asked to do,\u201d he said and added there would be \u201cno more measures\u201d. The future of the \u20ac86bn financial aid programme is contingent on Athens implementing agreed economic reforms. The IMF has repeatedly said it will not sign up to the programme unless the crisis-plagued country is given more generous debt relief in the form of a substantial write-down. With Greece facing a \u20ac7bn debt repayment to the European Central Bank in July, fears of a Greek default have once again hit markets with shares falling and interest rates on Greek debt rising. But Tsipras is also under pressure from back-benchers in his fragile two-party administration. After seven years of adopting grueling austerity in return for emergency bailout aid many are openly questioning the wisdom of applying yet more measures that have already put Greece in a permanent debt deflationary cycle. All eyes are now on a flying visit Europe\u2019s economics chief Pierre Moscovici will make to Athens on Wednesday. Government sources said they were hoping the EU commissioner would come with an \u201chonourable compromise\u201d acceptable to all so that stalled negotiations could resume with the return of auditors as soon as possible. But the eurozone chief, Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, warned it was unlikely a solution would be found before the next meeting of finance ministers representing countries in the currency bloc on 20 February \u2013 raising the spectre that Greece could be headed for a rerun of 2015 when it teetered towards euro exit. On Monday, Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, raised the stakes further saying Greece could not be singled out for special treatment. \u201cWe have been asked to help, but can only help at terms and conditions that are even-handed,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cIn other words we cannot cut a special sweet deal for a particular country because it is that county.\u201d Despite the delay, Greek officials have repeatedly voiced optimism that the review will soon be concluded.

      "bodyText": "The Turnbull government\u2019s approach to returning the budget to surplus is unrealistic, and the burden will be borne disproportionately by individuals paying a higher share of their income in tax, according to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. John Edwards, a Ceda director and a former Reserve Bank board member, in a new overview released on Wednesday, says the projected decline of the deficit between now and 2020-21 arises only because tax receipts are expected to increase over that period by 1.6% of gross domestic product. \u201cOver half of that increase will be contributed by rising personal income tax. Over the four-year period beginning 2016\u201317, personal income tax is projected to increase by over $40bn, or a little more than one-fifth,\u201d Edwards says in the new paper. \u201cThis is roughly four times faster than the projected rate of growth of employment over the period and more than twice as fast as the projected rate of growth of wages, implying that most individuals in 2019\u201320 will be paying a higher share of their incomes as tax than they do today.\u201d Edwards uses the new snapshot to renew previous calls by Ceda for the government to consider alternative approaches, like reducing concessions on superannuation and capital gains tax, and extending the indirect tax base. He says that policy switch would \u201ctake Australia to surplus earlier, more reliably and with less reliance on personal income tax increases than the government now projects\u201d. Edwards says if tax receipts in 2019-20 increased to 23.9% of GDP instead of the projection in the mid year economic forecast of 23.2% of GDP, the government would be in surplus in 2019\u201320. The latest economic forecast has the budget returning to balance in 2020-21. Edwards says despite warnings from groups like Ceda that the government needs to adjust its budget strategy, cumulative deficits and debt remain high, \u201cthe reliance on projected increases in personal income tax on work incomes remains, and the projected resolution of the Australian government deficit is even further off\u201d. Ceda\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Martin, warned that decisions by the incoming Trump administration and the fallout from Brexit were generating economic headwinds with profound implications for Australia. \u201cDomestically, the lack of concrete policies to deal with the federal budget deficit problem, coupled with the rise of populist parties with slogans but no answers, will play a critical part in determining whether the Australian economy returns another year of modest growth or whether some genuine reform stimulates a much-needed uptick in productivity, employment and growth,\u201d Martin said in a statement issued ahead of the launch of Ceda\u2019s economic and political overview for 2017. He said the outlook for economic growth looked more positive, which would hopefully result in a fall in the unemployment rate. On Tuesday, an annual survey of macroeconomic forecasts from Australian Business Economists suggested the economic contraction in the September quarter last year was likely to be a one-off, and the economy should keep growing for the rest of 2017. The new survey found that 17 members of the ABE\u2019s 21-member executive committee believed the Australian economy would keep growing through 2017. Martin said the growth outlook was more encouraging, but infrastructure spending remained a priority. \u201cWhile it is anticipated growth and new jobs are likely to come from resources, infrastructure and agriculture and exports of services and goods to Asia, there are no guarantees while the federal government is loath to use its fragile triple-A credit rating to borrow to support much-needed infrastructure throughout the nation,\u201d he said. Martin said the government\u2019s projected return to surplus \u201cdoes not appear realistic\u201d and the reliance on personal income tax increases to help reduce the budget deficit was an issue of concern.",

      "body": "<p><strong> </strong>The Turnbull government\u2019s approach to returning the budget to surplus is unrealistic, and the burden will be borne disproportionately by individuals paying a higher share of their income in tax, according to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia.</p> <p>John Edwards, a Ceda director and a former Reserve Bank board member, in a new overview released on Wednesday, says the projected decline of the deficit between now and 2020-21 arises only because tax receipts are expected to increase over that period by 1.6% of gross domestic product.</p> <p>\u201cOver half of that increase will be contributed by rising personal income tax. Over the four-year period beginning 2016\u201317, personal income tax is projected to increase by over $40bn, or a little more than one-fifth,\u201d Edwards says in the new paper.</p> <p>\u201cThis is roughly four times faster than the projected rate of growth of employment over the period and more than twice as fast as the projected rate of growth of wages, implying that most individuals in 2019\u201320 will be paying a higher share of their incomes as tax than they do today.\u201d</p> <p>Edwards uses the new snapshot to renew previous calls by Ceda for the government to consider alternative approaches, like reducing concessions on superannuation and capital gains tax, and extending the indirect tax base.</p> <p>He says that policy switch would \u201ctake Australia to surplus earlier, more reliably and with less reliance on personal income tax increases than the government now projects\u201d.</p> <p>Edwards says if tax receipts in 2019-20 increased to 23.9% of GDP instead of the projection in the mid year economic forecast of 23.2% of GDP, the government would be in surplus in 2019\u201320.</p> <p>The latest economic forecast has the budget returning to balance in 2020-21.</p> <p>Edwards says despite warnings from groups like Ceda that the government needs to adjust its budget strategy, cumulative deficits and debt remain high, \u201cthe reliance on projected increases in personal income tax on work incomes remains, and the projected resolution of the Australian government deficit is even further off\u201d.</p> <p>Ceda\u2019s chief executive, Stephen Martin, warned that decisions by the incoming Trump administration and the fallout from Brexit were generating economic headwinds with profound implications for Australia.</p> <p>\u201cDomestically, the lack of concrete policies to deal with the federal budget deficit problem, coupled with the rise of populist parties with slogans but no answers, will play a critical part in determining whether the Australian economy returns another year of modest growth or whether some genuine reform stimulates a much-needed uptick in productivity, employment and growth,\u201d Martin said in a statement issued ahead of the launch of Ceda\u2019s economic and political overview for 2017.</p> <p>He said the outlook for economic growth looked more positive, which would hopefully result in a fall in the unemployment rate.</p> <p>On Tuesday, an annual survey of macroeconomic forecasts from Australian Business Economists suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/07/australian-economy-shrinks-by-05-in-september-quarter\">the economic contraction in the September quarter</a> last year was likely to be a one-off, and the economy should keep growing for the rest of 2017.</p> <p>The new survey found that 17 members of the ABE\u2019s 21-member executive committee believed the Australian economy would keep growing through 2017.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/14/australias-economy-likely-to-keep-growing-in-2017-experts-say\">Australia's economy likely to keep growing in 2017, experts say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Martin said the growth outlook was more encouraging, but infrastructure spending remained a priority.</p> <p>\u201cWhile it is anticipated growth and new jobs are likely to come from resources, infrastructure and agriculture and exports of services and goods to Asia, there are no guarantees while the federal government is loath to use its fragile triple-A credit rating to borrow to support much-needed infrastructure throughout the nation,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>Martin said the government\u2019s projected return to surplus \u201cdoes not appear realistic\u201d and the reliance on personal income tax increases to help reduce the budget deficit was an issue of concern.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Janet Yellen says Fed on course to raise US rates, UK inflation jumps to 1.8% - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen opened the door to further US interest rate rises if the economy continued on track, telling US senators waiting too long to act would be \u201cunwise\u201d. The comments saw the dollar move higher, with analysts suggesting Yellen had been more hawkish than expected. Against a basket of currencies the US currency added 0.36%. But Yellen also warned that the economic outlook was uncertain, although she repeatedly refused to be drawn on what effect President Trump\u2019s proposed policies would have on the economy. Yellen maintained bank lending had grown despite the Dodd Frank regulations designed to avoid a new financial crisis, prompting Senator Elizabeth Warren to say Trump and his advisors were wrong to think of rolling them back. But not everyone agreed that banks were lending as freely as was claimed. On immigration, Yellen said slowing the pace of immigration would slow economic growth. Here is our full report on the Yellen hearing, leading on the disagreements over Dodd Frank: Earlier, UK inflation rose at its fastest pace for two-and-a-half years but Germany\u2019s economy grew more slowly than expected. And with that, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Senator Chris Van Hollen asks about wage gowth. Yellen: Somewhat faster wage growth would be consistent with our inflation objective. Ultimately real wage growth is limited by productivity growth which is why I\u2019ve lamented it [productivity growth] has been so slow. I would like congress to focus on policies which would increase productivity... She adds that there are a number of areas which impact productivity, including policies which promote education, innovation etc. And with that the hearing is over. Senator John Kennedy asks about slow growth, and what blame the Fed has. Yellen: We have put in place a monetary policy to get economy growing at its potential. She says this has boosted employment but productivity needs to improve. Kennedy changes tack: If community banks did nothing in financial crisis why are they subject to Dodd Frank. Yellen says they are not subject to exactly the same rules and large parts of Dodd Frank do not apply to them. We have done our best to tailor our regulations so they are appropriate according to the risk. Kennedy: Does it bother you no one responsible for the financial crisis went to jail? Yellen: I think those who were accountable should have had appropriate punishment. It is up to the Justice Department to impose criminal sanctions and in many cases I understand they thought they could not get convictions. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto asks about the benefits of immigration, and the contribution for the economy given President Trump\u2019s recent orders. What impact would [Trump\u2019s moves] have on our growth and competitiveness Yellen: Slowing the pace of immigration would probably slow growth. Masto: If the Mexican economy went into recession, what effect would that have on the US. Yellen: Our economies are closely tied, our developments here have a spillover flow to them and there could be flows in the opposite direction. Senator Dean Heller says he wasn\u2019t there earlier so did Yellen say there might be a rate rise in March. Yellen (who suddenly and coincidentally has a small outbreak of coughing) tries to pay it straight and says: I indicated that at our coming meetings we will try to evaluate whether economy is progressing in line with expectations and if it is it will probably be appropriate to raise interest rates further. A gradual rise in rates is likely to be appropriate. Heller: Is it the same answer for an interest rate rise at the June meeting? Yellen: The economic outlook is uncertain, but in December we said a few interest rate rises would be appropriate this year. Every meeting is live. Heller: what effect would fiscal stimulus have? Yellen repeats it is too soon to know what these measures are, and fiscal policy is only one of many things we have to consider. Heller: what is better, tax cuts or spending. Yellen: a decision for Congress. Heller: Do you support a border tax. Yellen also brushes this off as a matter for Congress. [Nice try Senator Heller.] Senator Brian Schatz asks about climate change. To what extent does Fed take this into account in assessing risks. Yellen: In monetary policy our forecasts do not go out so far that climate change would affect economy. If have a hurricane etc, that may have impact we take into account. Schatz: I\u2019d like to disagree. That\u2019s not the case any more. We\u2019re not talking about severe weather in 15 years, we\u2019re talking about what\u2019s happened in the last few years. It\u2019s having a material impact on the economy now. Yellen: Various economic fora are looking into effects of climate change on economy. We recognise that risk events such as severe weather could have effects on the financial system. We\u2019ve been trying to build resilience so financial companies can deal with risk events. Senator Thom Tillis: On bank lending, there is other research [from that quoted by Yellen earlier] showing a decrease in the amount of loans post-crisis. Is it possible that far fewer people are actually asking for loans. Yellen: I think that is true and a lot of small businesses say growth does not justify significant expansion plans. Tillis: Isn\u2019t it problematic to make us think only a small number are not getting loans. I think there is pent up demand. Yellen: Sometimes small businesses borrow against homes etc, so because there was a reduction in residential property values [there was less ability to borrow] Our objective is for banks to lend, safe and sound loans. Tillis: on one hand we say banks can lend to anyone, then say you can\u2019t lend outside these narrow parameters. [Can\u2019t say] anyone can borrow. The Dodd Frank bill expanded into [a huge amount of regulations]. Here\u2019s a good graphic from ING Bank on Yellen\u2019s comments: Senator Tim Scott talks about ways to mitigate regulatory burden for smaller banks. Yellen says this is important. Congress might want to except community banks from some of the provisions. Senator Elizabeth Warren brings up the Trump plan to row back on the Dodd-Frank regulations on banks. She says Trump said Dodd Frank was a \u201cdisaster\u2019 and banks were not lending, and wants Yellen\u2019s view. Yellen says lending has grown, It exceeds its 2008 peak, and the same is true of total loans held by banks. We have seen healthy growth in actual lending in the economy. Over half of small businesses in a survey said they did not need to borrow. Warren: So the data do not back up the President. Warren than asks about comments that banks have having to hoard capital. Does this prevent banks lending? Yellen says its not a requirement that they take the money and don\u2019t use it, the capital is used to make loans. Warren asks how US banks have done in comparison to foreign competitors since Dodd-Franks. Yellen says she believes our banks are more profitable, are capturing market share from European banks, are well capitalised and seen as safe and strong. Warren says if we are considering changing regulations, we need to start with facts and these show Trump and his advisors are wrong on every reason they\u2019ve given for tearing up Dodd Franks. We did this kind of [lack of] regulation before and it resulted in the worst financial crisis since the great depression. Senator Tom Cotton says wage growth has been largely stagnant over the last few years although there have been some signs of increase. Yellen says wage growth depends on productivity growth, which has been relatively depressed in recent years. We\u2019ve seen much higher wage growth for skilled workers, compared to less skilled. Wage growth has picked up somewhat [as the labour market gets tighter]. We have put in place conditions intended to lower unemployment rate.. and the labour market has in a general sense started to improve. As Yellen continues, Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, believes her comments on interest rates were stronger than expected: Yellen\u2019s tone to the newly elected Congress was definitely \u201cballsy\u201d, it suggest that she will maintain the Fed\u2019s independence, and will stand her ground when it comes to any risks that the Trump administration may (or may not) pose to financial and economic stability in the US. She was a touch more hawkish than expected, which, when combined with comments from non-voter Lacker who said that the case is building for a rate hike in March, boosted the dollar, weighed on equities and on bonds... Watch out for who Trump picks to fill the vacant spots on the Fed. Yellen called for diversity, but if Trump fills those spots with people akin to his own world view \u2013 low rates and lower dollar \u2013 then the path of Fed policy could change sharply going forward. Back with senator Shelby who asks about the trade imbalance and the long term effects. Yellen says the current account deficit on goods and services has increased, it leads to a build up in our endebtedness to foreigners so it is a long term concern. It is currently close to $500bn a year. Whether it is troubling depends on what the long term trends are. Toomey ends by calling for the Fed not to make any new regulations until the new members of the Fed are appointed. Senator Pat Toomey asks about the Fed\u2019s growth forecast. He says the new President committed to tax reform, rollback of regulation, an infrastructure spending bill and people believed that would give stronger economic growth, with equities rising. Yet the December Fed meeting had no change in their opinion for the prospects for economic growth. It looks like the Fed believes these things will either not happen or are not pro-growth. Yellen says we don\u2019t yet have clarity. Most of my colleagues decided not to speculate on the economic policy changes and their consequences. Some said they assumed there would be a mild fiscal stimulus, but most decided we wanted more clarity before incorporating them into our forecasts. Asked about consumer lending, Yellen says it is critical to monitor for abuses in consumer lending, and says she wishes the Fed had been more active previously. Senator Bob Menendez asks about the plans to repeal Obamacare and its effects on the economy. Yellen says we would have to look at the effect, a loss of access to health insurance could have an impact on household spending and on the economy. Access to healthcare has likely improved people\u2019s mobility, and losing this could have implications for job mobility. Senator Bob Corker asks about future policy changes (from the government) and their effect on the economy (referring to Trump\u2019s plans to boost infrastructure spending, tax reforms etc). Yellen says: We recognise there may be significant economic policy changes and they could affect outlook. We don\u2019t yet have enought clarity on what changes will be put in place to factor them in. We don\u2019t want to base current policy on speculation on what may come down the line. [Policy changes] could affect monetary policy but it depends on what they are and the timing. We will certainly pay attention to it. Some of the policiies being discussed may raise the deficit and have an effect on economic growth. But I would say fiscal sustainability has been a long standing problem. Reed asks about cyber security and how important it is for companies to have expertise. Yellen says cyber security is a major major risk that financial firms face. Boards are aware and appreciate the seriousness of the risk. But it is very important for boards to have appropriate expertise. Senator Jack Reed asks about Taylor\u2019s rule for setting interest rates and what effect that would have. Yellen says: Taylor\u2019s rule would call for a rate between 3.5 to 4%, higher than current Fed rate. I believe we would have a weaker economy if we had followed the dictates of that rule. Senator Richard Shelby asks about the three forthcoming openings at the Fed, and whether Yellen will see out her term which ends early next year. Yellen says firmly: I do intend to complete my term as chair. On the three forthcoming new members, Yellen says the role of the chair is to work constructively with all the governors. On removing rules and regulations - including Trump\u2019s executive order calling for removing two existing rules for every new one - Yellen says independent agencies are not bound by this. Yellen finishes her prepared remarks. Now the questions. Senator Sherrod Brown asks whether banks are not lending (something members of Trump\u2019s administration have suggested) Yellen says only 2% of small businesses said in a survey they could not get the lending they needed. Brown: So just because people in high places say it, doesn\u2019t make it so. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Yellen largely maintained the same tone seen in the central bank\u2019s January meeting, claiming that a rate hike would be appropriate if inflation and wage growth matches the its current expectations, while hinting that Donald Trump\u2019s fiscal policies could change the course of the Fed\u2019s 2017 journey. Differing views about an imminent US rate rise. Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief US economist says: But: Here is Yellen\u2019s opening statement in full. On interest rates, Yellen said: As I noted on previous occasions, waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise, potentially requiring the FOMC to eventually raise rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee\u2019s expectations. At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate. On the possible policy changes which could come from president Trump: That said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In her opening testimony to the senate, US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said a rate increase would be appropriate at one of its forthcoming meetings if employment and inflation evolved in line with expectations. She said waiting too long to remove monetary policy accommodation would be unwise, and could require rapid, disruptive rate rises which could push the US economy into recession. As it stands gradual increases in rates would probably be appropriate. The jobs market is continuing to strengthen, and inflation is moving up to the 2% target. On Trump\u2019s fiscal policy, she said changes could affect the economic outlook but it was too early to know how this would unfold. US markets have dipped slightly as investors await Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments to Congress, due to start shortly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 13 points or 0.07% lower while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.15%. Late last month, congressman Patrick McHenry wrote to Fed chair Janet Yellen calling on the central bank to stop negotiating agreements with other regulators. He said: \u201cThe Federal Reserve must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has had an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America\u2019s best interests.\u201d Now Reuters is reporting a reply from Yellen, saying such global negotiations benefit the US and the Fed has the authority and responsibility to consult with its foreign counterparts. Another topic for today\u2019s hearing, no doubt. Over in Greece... farmers are holding protests against the government\u2019s austerity-driven tax rises. The group have reached Syntagma Square, site of the Athens parliament, chanting \u201cpeople don\u2019t bow your heads. The only way forward is organisation and struggle.\u201d Lambros Papaconstantinou, a farmer from Karditsa, told the Guardian: \u201cWe are determined to go to the end because there is no other way. How can we survive when 70 percent of our earnings go on taxes, fuel costs, social contributions?\u201d And ahead of Yellen\u2019s testimony: Michael Flynn may have hit the headlines by resigning as President Trump\u2019s national security advisor, but markets are more likely to be focused on a testimony to the Senate later from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. The Fed has indicated it could raise US rates three times this year, so any hints from Yellen in this direction - and whether the first increase will come in March - will be keenly watched. With Trump previously criticising the Fed for its low interest rate policy, her views on the president\u2019s tax and spending plans could also form part of the questioning. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said: The last meeting of the US central bank saw monetary policy kept on hold, with little alteration made on the previous statement. With forward guidance implying that the rate-setting body believe there will be three rate hikes this year, the market is once more predicting a more dovish path. With an approximately 35% chance currently being given for a March hike, today\u2019s speech could provide an opportunity for Ms. Yellen to show that she is serious in making significant progress in the normalisation of monetary policy before her term expires next year. A failure to do so could see more pressure come on the US dollar going forward, with the hugely popular call before the turn of the year for a further appreciation in the buck in 2017 starting to look in need of a more hawkish Fed. Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said: Overall, the market is looking for three things: is the Fed still thinking about three rate hikes this year? Has anything occurred that could de-rail this expectation? Will Yellen give the markets a reality check by voicing some scepticism about potential fiscal change under President Trump? Here\u2019s Katie Allen\u2019s news story on this morning\u2019s inflation report: UK inflation climbed to 1.8% in January, driven by a jump in fuel prices, while the weak pound and rising oil price sent costs for firms soaring. The Office for National Statistics said inflation was at its highest level since June 2014 and followed a reading of 1.6% in December. But it was below a forecast for 1.9% in a Reuters poll of economists, as falling clothes prices offset some of the upward pressure on inflation from fuel and food. The more modest than expected inflation reading bolstered expectations that the Bank of England will be in no hurry to raise interest rates to keep price rises in check. Reflecting that view, the pound dipped. It had been above $1.25 against the dollar before the figures and fell to $1.2464 by late morning, down 0.5% on the day. However, economists say inflation will rise further this year, going through the Bank of England\u2019s target within months. Fuelling the rise is the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote, which makes imports to the UK more expensive, and also the rise in oil prices on the back of lower production. \u201cWe expect headline inflation to break through the 2% target as early as February and keep rising to around 3% by autumn this year,\u201d said Oliver White, economist at Fathom Consulting..... More here: Peter Dowd MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, says the solution to higher inflation includes curbs on utility firms and a higher minimum wage: \u201cToday\u2019s further rise in inflation to its highest level since June 2014 shows that after seven wasted years of Tory spending cuts and failure to invest, it\u2019s working people that are being squeezed. With shocking increases in the price of household utilities announced last week, it\u2019s time for this government to get tough on the profiteers. \u201cOnly Labour will take the firm action needed to end the Tories\u2019 rigged economy, by taking action to tackle gas and electricity price rises, bringing the railways back into public ownership to end the ticket price rip-off, and bringing in a \u00a310 per hour Real Living Wage.\u201d Rising inflationary pressures may drive more manufacturers into \u2018shrink-flation\u2019, where they discretely trim the size of their products but don\u2019t change the price. James Brown from pricing expert Simon-Kucher explains: We expect to see fewer or lighter promotions, and smaller or lighter products on the shelves over the coming months. The implication for shoppers is that we end up paying more for the same. Take Quality Street tins, for example, which have been getting steadily slimmer as the years go by: But the ONS won\u2019t be fooled. They have an army of trained price collectors, who scour the shops to check prices, and also keep tabs on whether we\u2019re getting less for our money. Katie Allen took a trip with one \u2018inflation food soldier\u2019 last week. Here\u2019s her report: James Wells of the the ONS points out that Britain isn\u2019t the only country facing higher prices. Germany\u2019s inflation rate jumped to 1.9% last month..... Both countries will have been hit by the jump in oil prices over the last year. But monetarists, such as Tim Goldsmith, blame central banks for creating too much money.... We\u2019ve also had some disappointing economic data from the eurozone this morning. The single currency bloc only grew by 0.4% in the last quarter of 2016, not the punchier 0.5% that was initially estimated last month. Eurostat, the statistics body, has revised down its figures following weaker-than-expected growth figures from Germany (0.4%) and Italy (0.2%) this morning. And in another blow...Greece is shrinking again. New figures show that its GDP shrank by 0.4% in October-December. The cost of living squeeze is already forcing some families to seek help handing their debts, warns the Money Advice Trust. Jane Tully, director of external affairs, fears that rising inflation will drag more people into difficulties: \u201cHousehold budgets are being chipped away by this new squeeze on personal finances \u2013 and many people who are only \u2018just about managing\u2019 risk falling into problem debt as a result. \u201cDemand for debt advice is already surging this year, and this demand is likely to continue to grow as the squeeze continues. Rising inflation and high levels of household borrowing mean that it has never been more important for government, advice agencies and lenders to work together to make sure people get the help they need. \u201cAnyone struggling to cope should seek free advice from a charity-run service like National Debtline as soon as possible.\u201d There are two main factors that drove Britain\u2019s inflation rate jumped from 1.6% to 1.8% last month -- fuel costs surged, and the long run of falling food prices is levelling out. The ONS says that: Transport: prices, overall, fell by 0.6% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a larger fall of 2.5% a year ago. Within transport, the largest upward effect came from motor fuels, with prices rising by 3.4% between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 2.6% a year earlier. Food and non-alcoholic beverages: Food prices were unchanged between December 2016 and January 2017, having fallen by 0.6% a year ago. Following a sustained period of deflation of food prices since mid-2014, during which the 12-month rate was often lower than negative 3.0%, the rate has increased for 4 consecutive months, reaching negative 0.4% in January 2017. This is the highest it has been since June 2014. But...this was partly countered by cheaper clothing costs, thanks to the post-Christmas sales. The ONS explains that: Clothing and footwear: the downward effect was due to prices for a wide range of items of clothing and footwear. Overall, prices fell by 4.2% between December 2016 and January 2017, compared with a smaller fall of 3.1% last year. Sales patterns may have contributed to this, as the proportion of items on sale increased by more between December 2016 and January 2017 than it did a year ago. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for readers worrying about inflation: \u201cThe Brex-effect is starting to bite into our wallets and put extra pressure on our household budgets. With the cost of fuel shooting up there\u2019s never been a better time to rethink your travel arrangements. Now might be the time to look at car sharing, cycling or at least clearing out your boot to make your driving more economical. \u201cThis news will hurt anyone with savings; if your account isn\u2019t paying you at least 1.8% your money will be losing buying power. Don\u2019t let your bank keep your hard earned cash without giving you a decent return; use savings to pay off expensive debts or get a high interest current account.\u201d How high could inflation go this year? Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, reckons it could spike to 3% - well over the Bank of England\u2019s target (and probably exceeding many people\u2019s pay rises). He says: \u201cThe trend is clearly towards higher inflation, however, and we should expect the rate of price increases to rise above the 2% Bank of England target in the next few months. By the end of this year, inflation is likely to be around 3pc and possibly even higher. Rising energy prices and the weakness of the pound are the main factors behind this expected increase. Britain isn\u2019t the only economy facing higher inflation, points out Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte. He says: \u201cRising inflation is not just a UK phenomenon and is not just currency-related. Prices are rising across the West, as higher fuel and other commodity prices feed through to consumers. In fact, German prices have risen faster than UK prices in the last year and last month Germany\u2019s inflation rate was higher than the UK\u2019s [at 1.9%].\u201d This \u2018reflation\u2019 trade is one reason that world stock markets are climbing, with Wall Street hitting record highs again last night. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is very concerned that inflation is going to take a big chunk out of workers\u2019 earnings - particularly public sector workers, whose pay rises are capped at 1%. \u201cThe last thing working people need is another pay squeeze. But prices are shooting up and real wage growth is stalling. \u201cNext month\u2019s Budget must set out a clear plan for preventing another living standards crisis \u2013 families still haven\u2019t recovered from the last one. \u201cThis should include ending the current pay restrictions on nurses, teachers and other public servants.\u201d Jeremy Cook of World First is in the Valentine\u2019s spirit: Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, fears that inflation will overtake wage rises this year - meaning real incomes will start falling again. He points to the surge in the cost of imported raw materials: Sterling has fallen around 12% on a trade-weighted basis since last June\u2019s referendum, and as a result producers are facing sharply higher input costs \u2013 up 20.5% on a year earlier. It\u2019s almost unthinkable that cost increases of this magnitude can be fully absorbed, leaving firms with little choice but to pass at least some of the burden onto consumers. By the end of the year price inflation looks set to outstrip wage growth, which will squeeze household budgets in the short term. Good grief! The prices paid by UK manufacturers for imported raw materials and fuel jumped by 20% in January, compared to a year earlier. That\u2019s largely due to the fall in sterling (down 13%), and and the higher cost of crude oil (up 82% year-on-year). Factories are now passing some of this cost onto their customers. Output prices rose by 3.5%, which is likely to push consumer price inflation up in the months ahead. This jump in inflation shows that Britain is now suffering the impact of the slump in the pound since the Brexit vote. So says Tom Stevenson, investment director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, who believes the cost of living will keep climbing. \u201cThe fall in the pound is really starting to stoke inflation as the rising cost of imports bites. A sharp rise in UK CPI now sees inflation within a whisker of the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Sterling weakness has continued to push fuel and food prices higher, resulting in today\u2019s CPI reading of 1.8%. \u201cWith Britain seemingly heading for a hard Brexit, it\u2019s likely we will see the pound continue to wobble over the next two years, resulting in higher inflation in the short term. Indeed, price rises are expected to reach 2.8% by the end of the year. \u201cWith inflation forecast to exceed the Bank of England\u2019s target this year, still slow wage growth and Mark Carney showing no intention of raising rates any time soon, millions of households will begin to feel the financial squeeze in their pockets. Rising prices and relatively stagnant incomes are a painful combination. Today\u2019s rise in inflation will leave many people worrying that their disposable income is shrinking, especially if their pay isn\u2019t rising at a similar rate. The Treasury admits that this is a worry, with a spokesperson saying that: \u201cEmployment has reached record levels and earnings have risen faster than inflation for more than 2 years. The government appreciates that families are concerned about the cost of living and that is why we are cutting taxes for millions of working people and have frozen fuel duty, saving an average driver \u00a3130 a year compared to previous plans.\u201d The pound has fallen by half a cent against the US dollar since the inflation figures came out, to $1.247. That\u2019s because City economists had expected an even sharper rise in inflation, to 1.9%. Britain\u2019s inflation rate is being driven up by the rising cost of motor fuels, says the Office for National Statistics. That\u2019s because the oil price has risen sharply over the last year, from $33 per barrel to around $55 today. Food prices also had an upward impact on the cost of living in January. But clothing and footwear prices fell by more than a year ago. Britain\u2019s CPI inflation rate is now at its highest level since June 2014: Breaking! Britain\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 1.8% in January, up from 1.6% in December. That\u2019s takes the Consumer Prices Index closer to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, and suggests that the weak pound is continuing to drive up the cost of living. More to follow! It\u2019s nearly time for the latest UK inflation figures, which will show how the cost of living increased in January. In the meantime, market research firm GfK has just reported that 34% of people expect future consumer price increases will happen \u201cmore rapidly\u201d than the past 12 months. This is more than three times as many as the 11% that thought this in January 2016. Joe Staton, Head of Market Dynamics at GfK, says: \u201cThe fall in the value of the Pound since the Brexit vote has fuelled speculation among both business leaders and consumers alike that we will see accelerated price inflation filter through to the High Street this year. Consumers have already been hit by higher food and energy prices because the weakness of sterling is raising prices and reducing consumer spending power. This has affected a range of typical purchases from Marmite to Majorca summer holidays. This chart, from economist Rupert Seggins, shows how the pound (in red) has weakened since last summer\u2019s referendum. Italy\u2019s growth figures are out...and, like Germany\u2019s, they\u2019re weaker than hoped. The Italian economy (rarely the most vigorous of beasts) expanded by a meagre 0.2% in the last thee months of 2016. Some economists had hoped Italy might hit the dizzy heights of 0.3% growth, which would still have been below the euro average. Back to today\u2019s growth figures...and the Netherland\u2019s economy has slowed. Dutch GDP rose by 0.5% in the last three months of 2016, a decent-enough number, but rather slower than the 0.8% growth recorded in July-September. There\u2019s drama in Tokyo this morning, where Toshiba has revealed it is taking a $6.3bn writedown on its troubled nuclear power division, and announced that its chairman is stepping down. Toshiba has also been forced to delay the publication of its latest earnings report, as it tries to assess the full damage following its mishandled purchase of a US construction firm. Here\u2019s the full story: Commerzbank analyst Joerg Kraemer argues that Germany\u2019s economy is still in good shape, even though growth missed forecasts in the last quarter. He says: \u201cThe fourth quarter was not as strong as most economists had expected, but sentiment surveys rose sharply in the past months and orders are also pointing upward,\u201d \u201cTherefore growth could slightly pick up in the first quarter of 2017.\u201d It\u2019s a historic day for Rolls-Royce, for the wrong reasons. The engine-maker has reported its biggest ever loss, a whopping \u00a34.6bn, this morning, due to sterling\u2019s weakness and the company\u2019s \u00a3671m fine for bribery. CEO Warren East argued that Rolls is making good progress with its cost-cutting programme. But the City isn\u2019t impressed, sending its shares down 3% in early trading.... In another blow to the eurozone, Finland\u2019s economy is shrinking again. Finnish GDP contracted by 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, new figures show, wiping out the 0.4% growth in July-September. Austerity, the demise of Nokia, and the sanctions imposed on Russia have all hurt Finland\u2019s economy; today\u2019s figures show its economy is only 0.2% larger than a year ago. Frederik Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet fears that Germany could drag the overall eurozone growth rate down, from the \u2018flash\u2019 estimate of 0.5% in Q4. Holger Zschaepitz of Welt points out that net trade had a negative impact on German growth (because imports grew faster than exports) Germany\u2019s economy didn\u2019t perform as well as hoped in the final three months of last year. New figures show that German GDP expanded by 0.4% in the October-December period, weaker than the 0.5% which economists had predicted. That means Europe\u2019s \u2018powerhouse economy\u2019 lagged behind the UK, which grew by 0.6% in the same period. In a double-whammy, German growth in the third quarter of 2016 has been revised down too, from +0.2% to just 0.1%. German\u2019s statistics office says that foreign trade held back growth in the last three months of the year, with imports growing much faster than exports. But growth was supported by government spending, and a small pick-up in consumer spending too. Reaction to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s lots on the agenda today. For starters, we\u2019re getting growth figures from Germany (out now) and Italy (9am GMT) for the last three months of 2016. That\u2019s followed by a new estimate for eurozone GDP at 10am. Then at 9.30am it\u2019s the latest UK inflation data, which is likely to show another jump in the cost of living. Economists expect that inflation rose by around 1.9% in January, up from 1.6% in December. On the corporate front, engine maker Rolls-Royce is reporting results for the first time since it took a \u00a3671m fine to settle bribery claims. Then this afternoon, America\u2019s top central banker Janet Yellen is testifying to Congress, from 3pm GMT. She can expect questions on the state of the US economy, president Trump\u2019s fiscal plans, and the prospect of interest rate rises soon. Some on Wall Street reckon the Fed won\u2019t manage its target of three hikes this year, so Yellen\u2019s comments could move the dollar. RBC Capital Markets say: Given the uncertainty of timing on the fiscal agenda and the relatively modest uptick in inflation thus far this year, we think it will be difficult for the committee to get enough members onboard for a hike in March (not to mention that the French election in late April/early May looms large as a potential catalyst for global volatility). But Yellen could certainly move the \u201cperception\u201d needle on this. There may be drama in Greece; hundreds of farmers are expected to protest against the government\u2019s austerity measure in Athens today.",

Incoming data suggest that labor market conditions continue to strengthen and inflation is moving up to 2 percent, consistent with the Committee\u2019s expectations.</p> <p>At our upcoming meetings, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with these expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the possible policy changes which could come from president Trump:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That said, the economic outlook is uncertain, and monetary policy is not on a preset course. FOMC participants will adjust their assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate in response to changes to the economic outlook and associated risks as informed by incoming data. Also, changes in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook. Of course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting U.S. fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory. In any event, it is important to remember that fiscal policy is only one of the many factors that can influence the economic outlook and the appropriate course of monetary policy. Overall, the FOMC\u2019s monetary policy decisions will be directed to the attainment of its congressionally mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37857dabfbf7db783ef6cbc838a9c9b6d3e0b13e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37857dabfbf7db783ef6cbc838a9c9b6d3e0b13e/0_0_1025_575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yellen testfies in Congress\" width=\"1000\" height=\"561\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yellen testfies in Congress</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C-Span</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T15:22:19.044Z\">at 3.22pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58a31bc0e4b012eeb30c9cf2\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T15:06:23.917Z\">3.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US rate increase appropriate if economy is in line with forecasts - Yellen</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In her opening testimony to the senate, US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said a rate increase would be appropriate at one of its forthcoming meetings if employment and inflation evolved in line with expectations.</p> <p>She said waiting too long to remove monetary policy accommodation would be unwise, and could require rapid, disruptive rate rises which could push the US economy into recession.</p> <p>As it stands gradual increases in rates would probably be appropriate.</p> <p>The jobs market is continuing to strengthen, and inflation is moving up to the 2% target.</p> <p>On Trump\u2019s fiscal policy, she said changes could affect the economic outlook but it was too early to know how this would unfold.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a31767e4b09b65848eb83a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T14:44:56.661Z\">2.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street edges lower ahead of Yellen testimony</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have dipped slightly as investors await Fed chair Janet Yellen\u2019s comments to Congress, due to start shortly.</p> <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is 13 points or 0.07% lower while the S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.13% and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.15%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a31185e4b0fcbf4e7d5b29\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T14:21:06.129Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Late last month, congressman Patrick McHenry wrote to Fed chair Janet Yellen calling on the central bank to stop negotiating agreements with other regulators.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe Federal Reserve must cease all attempts to negotiate binding standards burdening American business until President Trump has had an opportunity to nominate and appoint officials that prioritize America\u2019s best interests.\u201d</p> <p>Now Reuters is reporting a reply from Yellen, saying such global negotiations benefit the US and the Fed has the authority and responsibility to consult with its foreign counterparts.</p> <p>Another topic for today\u2019s hearing, no doubt.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58a30f3de4b09b65848eb81c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-02-14T14:11:21.360Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Over in Greece... farmers are holding protests against the government\u2019s austerity-driven tax rises.</strong></p> <p>The group have reached Syntagma Square, site of the Athens parliament, chanting \u201cpeople don\u2019t bow your heads.

With Trump previously criticising the Fed for its low interest rate policy, her views on the president\u2019s tax and spending plans could also form part of the questioning. David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The last meeting of the US central bank saw monetary policy kept on hold, with little alteration made on the previous statement. With forward guidance implying that the rate-setting body believe there will be three rate hikes this year, the market is once more predicting a more dovish path. With an approximately 35% chance currently being given for a March hike, today\u2019s speech could provide an opportunity for Ms. Yellen to show that she is serious in making significant progress in the normalisation of monetary policy before her term expires next year. A failure to do so could see more pressure come on the US dollar going forward, with the hugely popular call before the turn of the year for a further appreciation in the buck in 2017 starting to look in need of a more hawkish Fed. </p> </blockquote> <p>Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, the market is looking for three things: is the Fed still thinking about three rate hikes this year?

But it was below a forecast for 1.9% in a Reuters poll of economists, as falling clothes prices offset some of the upward pressure on inflation from fuel and food.</p> <p>The more modest than expected inflation reading bolstered expectations that the Bank of England will be in no hurry to raise interest rates to keep price rises in check.

      "bodyText": "British Airways cabin crew have announced four more days of strikes, to start on 22 February, as a dispute over pay continues. About 2,900 crew members in BA\u2019s mixed fleet belonging to the Unite union will stage industrial action for four days starting next Wednesday. The union says it aims to \u201cpile on the pressure\u201d on the airline, which it accuses of paying poverty wages to cabin crew. The strike is in addition to four days of strikes due to start on Friday. Since the start of the year there have been 11 days of strike action, including six days last week. But executives last week ruled out further negotiations. Basic pay in the mixed fleet, which all new recruits to BA join, starts at around \u00a312,000, though the airline says crew earn a minimum of \u00a321,000 after allowances and bonuses. Unite says cabin crew earn \u00a316,000 a year on average. Unite says BA has been forced to \u201cwet lease\u201d aircraft from other airlines to cover for the striking staff and estimates that this is costing the airline between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000 an hour. Unite regional officer Matt Smith said: \u201cOur estimates put the amount of money British Airways has spent on defending the dispute and poverty pay at \u00a31m. \u201cThis is money which the airline has taken a conscious decision to give to other airlines rather than addressing pay levels which are forcing hardworking mixed fleet cabin crew into financial hardship.\u201d He urged BA to attend arbitration talks with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas). BA said the action would not disrupt passengers\u2019 journeys. During this weekend\u2019s strike, all flights to and from London Gatwick and City airports would operate as normal, as would the vast majority of flights from Heathrow, a spokesman said. The airline would be \u201cmerging a very small number of flights\u201d \u2013 around 1% of flights planned, the spokesman said. \u201cWe will publish more details over the weekend in relation to further strikes called by Mixed Fleet Unite for 22-25 February, but as in previous strikes all customers will fly to their destinations,\u201d the spokesman said. During last week\u2019s strike BA cancelled 34 flights due to strike action, but the airline said all passengers had reached their destination. More than 9,000 cabin crew belonging to a different Unite branch had voted to accept the pay deal this week, according to a BA statement. Last week Willie Walsh, chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company, IAG, said: \u201cThe offer\u2019s on the table. There are no negotiations. The strikes have had no effect, the passengers are flying and flights are operating. So I\u2019d say this is completely futile action on the part of the union. The offer we\u2019ve made is a fair offer.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dueling senators turned the Federal Reserve chairwoman\u2019s first testimony before Congress since the election of Donald Trump into a row over Republican plans to defang Dodd-Frank, the financial regulation brought in after the Great Recession. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat emerging as Trump\u2019s leading critic, quizzed Janet Yellen on Trump\u2019s claims that Dodd-Frank was a \u201cdisaster\u201d and on his plans to dismantle it. Warren quoted Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cfriends of mine, who have nice businesses, can\u2019t borrow money\u201d. The senator asked Yellen whether it was true that banks were not lending as a result of the legislation, brought in to curb risky lending after the financial crisis. On Tuesday Warren also sent letters to the White House, Department of Labor and Financial Services Roundtable to ask what role, if any, banking industry lobbyists had played in the development and drafting of Trump\u2019s recent executive orders on financial regulation. Yellen said growth in lending was robust and that commercial and industrial loans were up 75% since 2010. \u201cWe have seen growth in active lending in the economy,\u201d said Yellen. Warren said Trump\u2019s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, who she said had spent a combined 42 years at Goldman Sachs, had both claimed that banks had been held back by the regulation. \u201cIn fact our banks have thrived since we passed Dodd-Frank,\u201d she said. Warren asked for a Wall Street Journal article on the record profits being recorded by Wall Street banks to be entered into the record of the day\u2019s hearing. Yellen agreed that the banks were profitable and in a better financial position than many of their foreign competitors. \u201cI don\u2019t have all the facts at my fingertips, I believe our banks are more profitable,\u201d she said. The Republican senator Thom Tillis said Dodd-Frank had undermined lending to small business. \u201cWe have completely destroyed the lower foundations of the banking ecosystem,\u201d he said. Yellen agreed that some regulations were holding back some lenders, particularly community banks. The Fed chair gave an upbeat assessment of the US economy and signaled the central bank could raise short-term interest rates at its next policy meeting in March. US stock markets, which have rallied to record highs since Trump\u2019s election, stalled as Yellen signaled a likely rate hike. The Fed chair said it was too early to say how Trump\u2019s plans to cut taxes and spur growth would affect the economy but warned that US debt was already on an \u201cunsustainable\u201d trajectory. Yellen said that if, as the Fed expects, the jobs market continues to improve and inflation continues to rise, an increase in the benchmark federal-funds rate would probably be appropriate \u201cat our upcoming meetings\u201d. Yellen told the Senate banking committee that \u201cwaiting too long would be unwise\u201d and could trigger a recession if the Fed was forced to raise rates rapidly, disrupting financial markets. The Fed chairwoman painted a largely positive picture of the US economy but warned that \u201cchanges in fiscal policy or other economic policies could potentially affect the economic outlook\u201d. \u201cOf course, it is too early to know what policy changes will be put in place or how their economic effects will unfold. While it is not my intention to opine on specific tax or spending proposals, I would point to the importance of improving the pace of longer-run economic growth and raising American living standards with policies aimed at improving productivity. I would also hope that fiscal policy changes will be consistent with putting US fiscal accounts on a sustainable trajectory,\u201d she said. The committee\u2019s questions displayed the split between Republicans and Democrats in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory. The Democratic senator Sherrod Brown asked Yellen about Trump\u2019s plans to cut regulation by imposing a new rule that for every new regulation introduced, two must be cut. \u201cDoes it make sense to remove two consumer protections for every new consumer protection?\u201d Other Democrats asked about the lack of diversity at the Fed and what the bank could do about the still disproportionately high rates of unemployment for African Americans and Native Americans. The Republican chairman, Mike Crapo, sought assurance that the Fed would not seek to marginalize a new Republican-appointed vice-chairman of supervision. Other Republicans asked about the likely impact on growth of Trump\u2019s policies and argued that lending for small businesses had fallen thanks to regulatory overreach. Yellen\u2019s prepared remarks came at the start of her two-day testimony, known as \u201cHumphrey-Hawkins\u201d for the 1978 law that first required it. She will appear before the House financial services committee on Wednesday.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A sharp rise in business rates for offices in the City of London is threatening to undermine the Square Mile\u2019s drive to remain a key financial centre in Europe after Brexit. The business rates bill for offices in the City will rise by \u00a31.4bn, or 33%, over the next five years. This means the 12,348 office addresses in the City will see their overall rates bill rise from \u00a3876m in this financial year to an average of \u00a31.16bn a year over the next five years, according to property agent CVS. The bill will be picked up by occupiers of the offices, and is a new blow to the City\u2019s banks, law firms and insurance companies as they weigh up their options after Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. Goldman Sachs, Nomura and law firm Linklaters all face tax rises, as does the Bank of England, which will pay \u00a321m in business rates over the next five years and faces an increase of more than \u00a31.5m a year on its Threadneedle Street headquarters. The disclosure of the bill for the City will increase the pressure on the government to make changes to the business rates system in the budget next month. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said the business rates increase facing thousands of businesses across the capital \u2013 including small high street shops, pubs and restaurants \u2013 is \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The overall increase in the business rates bill for London is expected to be \u00a39.4bn over the next years. In a letter to property representatives, seen by the Guardian, the mayor said he is working with the local authorities in London to push the government to devolve more responsibility for the tax to the capital. This could allow London to be \u201cdecoupled\u201d from national revaluation arrangements, he said, by valuing its own properties and setting its own tax. At present all properties in England are valued by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA). The business rates bill is then spread out across all properties, with the most valuable paying the highest tax. Business rates have already been devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The increase in business rates from April is the result of a new revaluation of the rental value of property in Britain. This is supposed to take place every five years but the previous revaluation was controversially delayed by the government for two years, making the change in bills from April more pronounced. London will be particularly affected because the rental value of property in prime areas has increased substantially since the financial crisis. Khan said in the letter: \u201cThe GLA is working with London councils and the leaders of the 33 local authorities in London to encourage the government to devolve more responsibility for the administration of business rates to the capital. \u201cThis would include devolving responsibility for the VOA to London government which would allow the capital to be decoupled from the national revaluation arrangements. Such devolved arrangements already operate successfully in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. \u201cThis reform would potentially allow us to avoid a repetition in five years\u2019 time of the very large increases in bills which have arisen in London as a result of the 2017 revaluation. It would also provide us with an opportunity to ensure that the VOA locally is adequately resourced to deal with the challenges of managing business rates in capital moving forward.\u201d Mark Rigby, the chief executive of CVS, backed the prospect of London taking more control of its business rates. \u201cWith \u00a39.38bn of business rates increases looming for London\u2019s 32 boroughs and the City over the next five years, and as we head down the path of fiscal devolution for the capital, a system which works better and more efficiently for businesses in London could not be more important,\u201d he said. \u201cI support the mayor on his forward-thinking approach that London should have more power over the valuation of it\u2019s commercial properties, and subsequently, with the right support for the Valuation Office Agency, this should lead to a swifter resolution of appeals for the capital\u2019s ratepayers and provide greater political, local accountability.\u201d The government is already pressing ahead with plans to allow parts of the country, including London, to retain 100% of their business rates by 2020. However, there are concerns this could leave some local authorities underfunded. Despite criticism of the business rates increases scheduled for April, the Department for Communities and Local Government, which oversees the system, has said it is fair because the revaluation reflects the state of the property market. Many businesses based in less affluent areas will see a cut in their rates bills as a result of the changes. A spokesman for the government said: \u201cOur financial services sector makes a crucial contribution to our economy and we\u2019re determined that it continues as the hub for both Europe and the rest of the world. \u201cThis revaluation improves the fairness of rate bills by making sure they more closely reflect the property market. That means nearly three quarters of businesses in England will see no change or even a fall, and for the minority who do face an increase \u2013 including those in the City \u2013 we have introduced a \u00a33.6bn transitional relief scheme.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unions are urging the government to take back control of its nuclear strategy after Toshiba\u2019s deepening financial crisis cast fresh doubt about its involvement in the planned Moorside power station in Cumbria. Justin Bowden, GMB\u2019s national secretary for energy, described the situation as a \u201cfiasco\u201d after Japan\u2019s Toshiba, the lead party behind Moorside, revealed a $6.3bn writedown in its US Westinghouse business and confirmed it was scaling back investment in new overseas nuclear projects. Toshiba prompted confusion among investors on Tuesday by saying it was not ready to publish third-quarter results as scheduled, only to announce the write-down in its US nuclear business and resignation of its chairman, Shigenori Shiga, hours later. The company\u2019s shares fell 8% in Tokyo. Bowden said the UK government had become too reliant on foreign companies for delivering its energy strategy. \u201cToshiba\u2019s chairman falling on his sword underlines the gravity of the company\u2019s situation but must not be allowed to jeopardise the future of Moorside and put the security of this country\u2019s energy supply in any more of a precarious situation than it already is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fiasco with Toshiba shows exactly why relying on foreign companies for our energy needs it just plain stupid.\u201d Toshiba has a 60% stake in NuGen, the consortium behind the planned Moorside plant. French firm Engie is its partner on the project. The Japanese company first flagged up its financial woes and a potential multibillion-dollar write down in December. A spokesman for Toshiba said the company remained \u201ccommitted\u201d to Moorside, but it was unclear how long it would remain involved in the project, or to what extent. The firm confirmed on Tuesday that it would reduce its role on the construction of new plants, instead focusing on lower risk involvement such as equipment supply and engineering. Commenting specifically on Moorside, the spokesman said: \u201cRegarding the NuGen project, while Toshiba is committed to invest in the project until the final investment decision, we will subsequently seek to sell our shares to new investor(s). This has been our position from the start. Toshiba will consider participating in the project without taking on any risk from carrying out actual construction work.\u201d Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, sought to reassure that the UK project would go ahead. \u201cI have spoken to Toshiba and NuGen today. I welcome the continued commitment of the NuGen consortium to the Moorside project,\u201d he said. \u201cThe UK government is committed to new nuclear as an important part of our energy mix, having commissioned the first new nuclear power station in a generation. The UK is one of the most attractive countries to invest in new nuclear and we continue to work closely with partners to see Moorside built.\u201d Toshiba said the chairman was resigning to take \u201cmanagement responsibility\u201d for the writedowns related to its US subsidiary, Westinghouse, and its purchase of US construction company CB&amp;I Stone and Webster last year from Chicago Bridge and Iron. Toshiba warned that the figures it eventually released, including the $6.3bn write-down of its Westinghouse nuclear business, had not yet been approved by its auditors and could still be subject to major revision. The company\u2019s fully audited results are now due to be published on 14 March. Toshiba\u2019s stock market value has halved to $8.6bn since the financial problems at Westinghouse first came to light in December and it said it would seek to raise cash by selling the US nuclear operation and its Nand flash-memory chips business. Kevin Coyne, national officer for energy at Unite union, said Toshiba\u2019s indecision and delays would pile \u201cfurther agony upon this Cumbrian community\u201d. \u201cThe government must get a grip of the funding of these projects. It is the duty of the government, not the private sector, to ensure that UK energy is safe secure and that means it must act to bring our new power stations on stream. Keeping our lights on cannot be left to the whimsy of market forces.\u201d A decision by Toshiba to scrap Moorside would be a major blow to the government\u2019s strategy for nuclear, one of five areas prioritised in the prime minister\u2019s industrial strategy. The project, near Sellafield, is a key part of the government\u2019s ambitions for a new generation of nuclear power stations to fill the UK\u2019s energy gap in the next decade as coal plants and ageing atomic plants close.",

The company\u2019s shares fell 8% in Tokyo.</p> <p>Bowden said the UK government had become too reliant on foreign companies for delivering its energy strategy.</p> <p>\u201cToshiba\u2019s chairman falling on his sword underlines the gravity of the company\u2019s situation but must not be allowed to jeopardise the future of Moorside and put the security of this country\u2019s energy supply in any more of a precarious situation than it already is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe fiasco with Toshiba shows exactly why relying on foreign companies for our energy needs it just plain stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Toshiba has a 60% stake in NuGen, the consortium behind the planned Moorside plant. French firm Engie is its partner on the project. The Japanese company<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/29/toshiba-shares-plummet-for-third-day-running\"> first flagged up its financial woes and a potential multibillion-dollar write down in December</a>.</p> <p>A spokesman for Toshiba said the company remained \u201ccommitted\u201d to Moorside, but it was unclear how long it would remain involved in the project, or to what extent.</p> <p>The firm confirmed on Tuesday that it would reduce its role on the construction of new plants, instead focusing on lower risk involvement such as equipment supply and engineering.</p> <p>Commenting specifically on Moorside, the spokesman said: \u201cRegarding the NuGen project, while Toshiba is committed to invest in the project until the final investment decision, we will subsequently seek to sell our shares to new investor(s). This has been our position from the start. Toshiba will consider participating in the project without taking on any risk from carrying out actual construction work.\u201d</p> <p>Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, sought to reassure that the UK project would go ahead. \u201cI have spoken to Toshiba and NuGen today. I welcome the continued commitment of the NuGen consortium to the Moorside project,\u201d he said.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe UK government is committed to new nuclear as an important part of our energy mix, having commissioned the first new nuclear power station in a generation. The UK is one of the most attractive countries to invest in new nuclear and we continue to work closely with partners to see Moorside built.\u201d </p> <p>Toshiba said the chairman was resigning to take \u201cmanagement responsibility\u201d for the writedowns related to its US subsidiary, Westinghouse, and its purchase of US construction company CB&amp;I Stone and Webster last year from Chicago Bridge and Iron. </p> <p>Toshiba warned that the figures it eventually released, including the $6.3bn write-down of its Westinghouse nuclear business, had not yet been approved by its auditors and could still be subject to major revision. The company\u2019s fully audited results are now due to be published on 14 March.</p> <p>Toshiba\u2019s stock market value has halved to $8.6bn since the financial problems at Westinghouse first came to light in December and it said it would seek to raise cash by selling the US nuclear operation and its Nand flash-memory chips business.</p> <p>Kevin Coyne, national officer for energy at Unite union, said Toshiba\u2019s indecision and delays would pile \u201cfurther agony upon this Cumbrian community\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe government must get a grip of the funding of these projects. It is the duty of the government, not the private sector, to ensure that UK energy is safe secure and that means it must act to bring our new power stations on stream. Keeping our lights on cannot be left to the whimsy of market forces.\u201d</p> <p>A decision by Toshiba to scrap Moorside would be a major blow to the government\u2019s strategy for nuclear, one of five areas prioritised in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/22/pm-launches-sector-deals-industrial-strategy-of-state-intervention\">the prime minister\u2019s industrial strategy</a>.<br></p> <p>The project, near Sellafield, is a key part of the government\u2019s ambitions for a new generation of nuclear power stations to fill the UK\u2019s energy gap in the next decade as coal plants and ageing atomic plants close. </p>",

      "bodyText": "It was nice while it lasted, but the days of ultra-low inflation are over \u2013 at least for the time being. The year ahead is going to be marked by rising prices and squeezed living standards, but the pickup in the cost of living needs to be put in perspective; January\u2019s increase was smaller than expected, and the result of prices falling less sharply than they did a year ago. Also, the UK was spoiled by a couple of years in which crashing oil prices flattered the inflation figures. Some bounceback was always likely in late 2017, and the upward trend has been exacerbated by the decision of the Opec cartel to cut production. Britain is not alone in seeing prices start to rise. Germany currently has slightly higher inflation (1.9%) than the UK (1.8%), suggesting that the upward move over the winter has more to do with commodity prices than the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote last June. That interpretation is supported by the Office for National Statistics data for core inflation, which strips out the impact of energy, food, tobacco and alcohol. This stood at 1.4% last June and is now at 1.6%. Over the same period headline inflation \u2013 which includes all the above items \u2013 has risen from 0.5% to 1.8%. There is some evidence that competition is helping to keep the lid on prices. Clothing and footwear retailers had a pretty tough January and reduced prices by more than they did in early 2016. Without those high street and online bargains, the annual inflation rate would have risen closer to the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. That said, it looks unlikely that retailers will be able to defer price rises for ever. The separate ONS figures for producer prices \u2013 which measures how much manufacturers are paying for their fuel and raw material on the one hand and the cost of goods as they leave factory gates on the other \u2013 show a pronounced rise in the second half of 2016 and early 2017. Input prices are up by more than 20% year on year \u2013 the sharpest rise since oil prices were rocketing in 2008 \u2013 while factory gate prices are going up by 3.5% a year \u2013 the fastest rate since 2012. Some of this pressure, clearly, is the result of higher global energy prices. The 16% drop against the dollar is also making imports more expensive and this will have more of a bearing on inflation as 2017 wears on. Three conclusions can be drawn from all this. The first is that inflation is going to carry on climbing and will probably overtake the current rate of earnings growth within the next few months. The second is that the Bank of England will not respond with an increase in interest rates unless there is evidence that the higher cost of living has set off a price-wage spiral. But unless wages do start to rise, 2017 is going to be quite a tough year for consumers. The balance of the economy is likely to shift towards manufacturing and exporting, helped by the weak pound. That explains the third conclusion. Growth may not be that much weaker in 2017 than it was in 2016, but that is not the way it is going to feel to households. German growth can help in Brexit talks Germany will be crucial in the Brexit negotiations that will commence once Theresa May triggers the article 50 process next month. The prime minister\u2019s confidence that a deal good for all parties can be negotiated depends to a large extent on Angela Merkel\u2019s willingness to put the interests of German industry above the desire to use a punitive settlement to deter any other country that might be tempted to follow Britain\u2019s lead. The latest German growth figures are likely to foster rather than discourage such optimism among ministers in London. It was not that the expansion of the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy in the fourth quarter of 2016 was slightly smaller than expected \u2013 0.4% rather than 0.5% \u2013 and weaker than the UK\u2019s 0.6%. Rather, it was the breakdown of the growth, which was strongly dependent on domestic demand, and in particular higher government spending on refugees. Net trade, traditionally the motor of the German economy, subtracted from growth on the quarter because imports rose more strongly than exports. In one respect, this is a helpful development since Germany has been running an excessively high current account surplus and needs to bring it down for the good of the rest of the eurozone and the global economy. But the economy\u2019s future prospects are inextricably linked with the country\u2019s big manufacturers and the medium-sized \u2013 Mittelstand \u2013 companies that sit beneath them. With Donald Trump making protectionist noises, German exporters can already imagine the US market becoming more difficult during the course of 2017. They probably won\u2019t welcome access to the UK being simultaneously jeopardised \u2013 a point May will no doubt be making to Merkel.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "General Motors is in talks to sell its European arm Opel, which includes the UK\u2019s Vauxhall, to the company behind Peugeot, after branding Brexit a \u201cspeed bump\u201d that was slowing efforts to turn the loss-making division around. GM and France\u2019s PSA Group, which also owns Citro\u00ebn, said they were discussing \u201cnumerous strategic initiatives ... including a potential acquisition of Opel\u201d. The admission prompted calls for GM to clarify the future of its Vauxhall plants in Luton and Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, which together employ around 4,500 staff. Justin Madders, MP for Ellesmere Port and Neston, said: \u201cWe need to stress, if there are to be new owners, that we have very efficient operations over here in the UK. \u201cThey\u2019ve proved themselves to be excellent in comparison to other European plants.\u201d He stressed that if PSA buys Opel, it should not forget that the UK is the second-largest car market in Europe, but warned that whoever owns Vauxhall would need to be protected in Brexit negotiations. \u201cWe want to get to a point where whatever deal is agreed is one that doesn\u2019t introduce any barriers of tariffs to the car industry.\u201d In a letter to staff, GM offered few details but said it would \u201cseek to ensure any transaction would serve the best interests of all our respective important stakeholders\u201d. It also urged staff not to let the possibility of a sale become a \u201cdistraction\u201d. GM, the world\u2019s third-largest carmaker and the biggest in the US, has suffered more than $15bn of losses at Opel since 2000. It nearly sold the division after going bankrupt in 2009 but reversed the decision in a bid to maintain a foothold in the potentially lucrative European market. It had hoped to break even by now, but posted an annual loss of $257m (\u00a3206m) for 2016 earlier this month. Chuck Stevens, GM\u2019s chief financial officer, warned last year that the company was \u201cprepared to take whatever action is necessary\u201d to get its European business back on track. GM described the UK referendum result as a \u201cspeed bump on our path to where we want to take the business\u201d and warned that it would write down the value of GM Europe by $400m because of the fall in the value of the pound. Talks over a sale are likely to reawaken concerns over the future of Opel\u2019s UK operations, just four years after its Ellesmere Port plant came perilously close to closing. GM kept the plant open only after Vince Cable, then business secretary, travelled to Detroit to agree a deal and reassure the firm about the government\u2019s commitment to the industry. But any change in the ownership of Opel could render the agreement worthless, particularly in the light of oversupply in the European car market. Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at AutoTrader in the US, said: \u201cI believe it\u2019s still the case that there\u2019s excess capacity in Europe so that\u2019s an issue that\u2019s been discussed for years. \u201cWhat happens to jobs, where will they be, those are questions to ask if this goes forward.\u201d She said the EU referendum result was likely to be a factor if GM pulls out of Europe altogether. \u201cGM, especially in light of Brexit, must look at its European operations and see the prospects are low [that] it will make a profit any time soon. So it\u2019s not surprising they\u2019re considering some moves.\u201d She said the talks could result in a strategic alliance similar to the tie-up between Renault and Nissan. But if the two firms opt for a sale, the combined might of the Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn and Opel brands would see PSA Group overtake Renault to become Europe\u2019s second-largest car firm behind Volkswagen. GM and PSA Group already cooperate on the production of minivans and SUVs but their partnership was diminished in 2013 when GM sold a 7% stake in the French firm for \u00a3250m. In a statement on the company\u2019s website, GM said: \u201cSince 2012, General Motors and PSA Group have been implementing an alliance covering, to date, three projects in Europe and generating substantial synergies for the two groups. \u201cWithin this framework, General Motors and PSA Group regularly examine additional expansion and cooperation possibilities, as well. \u201cPSA Group and General Motors confirm they are exploring numerous strategic initiatives aiming at improving profitability and operational efficiency, including a potential acquisition of Opel Vauxhall by PSA. \u201cThere can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has suffered the biggest loss in its history due to the cost of settling corruption charges and the impact of Brexit on the value of sterling. The engine-maker reported a \u00a34.6bn statutory pre-tax loss for 2016, one of the biggest corporate losses in British history. It included a \u00a34.4bn writedown on the value of financial hedges Rolls uses to protect itself against currency fluctuations and a \u00a3671m charge for the penalties the company has agreed to pay to settle bribery and corruption charges with the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), the US Department of Justice, and Brazilian authorities. The biggest loss in British history is the \u00a324bn recorded by Royal Bank of Scotland for 2008. Warren East, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, insisted the loss did not reflect the underlying health of the business. \u201cThis has no impact on what is really going on in the business and cash, it is just an accounting measure,\u201d he said of the biggest loss for the company since Henry Royce established an electrical and mechanical business in 1884. Accounting rules mean Rolls was forced to write down the value of its currency hedges \u2013 which are worth more than \u00a330bn \u2013 to reflect sterling\u2019s slump. The pound has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU last June. Rolls hedges billions of pounds of cash to protect itself against currency fluctuations because deals in the aerospace industry are conducted in dollars. East said he hoped the Brexit negotiations would result in \u201cas close as possible to the status quo\u201d. East and the Rolls management team backed the UK remaining in the EU in last June\u2019s referendum. \u201cOur main reason for being on the remain side was uncertainty. The very fact you are asking the question shows there is uncertainty,\u201d he added. The charge for settling the corruption allegations comes after Rolls agreed to pay \u00a3671m of penalties plus interest to the UK, US and Brazil. Sir Brian Leveson, who approved the so-called deferred prosecution in court, said the SFO\u2019s investigation into Rolls had revealed \u201cthe most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption\u201d and that some of the charges \u201cimplicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company\u201d. However, the judge praised the cooperation of the firm\u2019s existing management, which allowed Rolls to settle with the SFO rather than face a damaging trial. The penalties related to charges that Rolls bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013 to win contracts. Although Rolls will make the payments over five years \u2013 with \u00a3293m expected to be paid in the first year \u2013 it has recognised the full cost in the latest accounts. The SFO is continuing its investigation into individuals involved in the scandal and has said it will announce in the next few months whether or not it will bring charges. However, East, who has apologised for the \u201cunacceptable\u201d behaviour, said the settlement and the financial results allowed the company to draw a line under the scandal. \u201cWe are continuing to cooperate with the SFO with any inquiries they want to do, but as far as the SFO is concerned that is it \u2013 as far as the Department of Justice is concerned that is it,\u201d he said. The Rolls boss indicated he was hopeful that the damage to the company\u2019s reputation would not lead to it losing lucrative contracts. \u201cIf you think about it in abstract, that is a risk,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have interacted with our customer base and generally there is an understanding that we are a very different business today.\u201d Excluding the bribery penalties and the impact of currency fluctuations, Rolls reported that underlying revenues fell 2% in 2016 to \u00a313.8bn and that underlying pre-tax profits fell 49% to \u00a3813m. This performance was ahead of forecasts in the City. Nonetheless, Rolls said it would hold the final payment to shareholders at the same level as last year \u2013 7.1p per share \u2013 given the company\u2019s financial commitments and the investments it is making. Rolls cut its dividend last year for the first time in 24 years. On the back of holding the dividend and a strong run for the share price in recent weeks, shares fell by 2.7% to 720.50p. East said it has been an \u201cimportant year\u201d for Rolls and the management team has \u201caccelerated the transformation of the business\u201d. The Rolls boss has been trying to overhaul and modernise the company since taking control in 2015, inheriting a business that is struggling for the first time in a decade. Rolls, which makes engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbos among others, has been affected by lower-than expected demand for the wide-bodied airliners to which it supplies engines. It has also been hurt by cuts to defence spending and the decline in the oil price, which has lowered demand from the offshore oil and gas industry for its marine products. In response, East has focused on making Rolls more efficient and accelerating the pace at which it builds engines. He has cut hundreds of middle and senior managers and by the end of 2017 wants to have cut \u00a3200m of annual costs.

These tend to be in areas associated with older and more backward-looking technology. But you shouldn\u2019t read into this that 20% of our business is up for sale.\u201d Sandy Morris, analyst at Jefferies, said: \u201cThe question is whether a corner has been turned.

The pound has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU last June. Rolls hedges billions of pounds of cash to protect itself against currency fluctuations because deals in the aerospace industry are conducted in dollars.</p> <p>East said he hoped the Brexit negotiations would result in \u201cas close as possible to the status quo\u201d. East and the Rolls management team backed the UK remaining in the EU in last June\u2019s referendum. \u201cOur main reason for being on the remain side was uncertainty.

This performance was ahead of forecasts in the City.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Rolls said it would hold the final payment to shareholders at the same level as last year \u2013 7.1p per share \u2013 given the company\u2019s financial commitments and the investments it is making.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s shock economic contraction in the September quarter last year was likely a one-off, and the economy should keep growing for the rest of 2017, according to some of the country\u2019s most senior economists. It means this year Australia should pass the Netherlands and snatch the record for the world\u2019s longest run without a recession. The annual survey of macroeconomic forecasts from the Australian Business Economists (ABE), released on Tuesday, shows 17 members of the ABE\u2019s 21-member executive committee believe the economy will keep growing through 2017. It was a unanimous decision of those surveyed \u2013 four members could not take part because they work for government or the Reserve Bank. The Netherlands holds the record for 26.5 years of uninterrupted growth. If the ABE\u2019s executive committee is correct, Australia will pass that record at the end of the June quarter (with the June quarter figures released in September). The group\u2019s annual forecasting conference will be held at the Reserve Bank offices in Sydney on Wednesday, where they will discuss the forecasts. Justin Wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, will talk to the group about the state of US politics and policy under Donald Trump. The ABE\u2019s executive committee was asked about Trump in this year\u2019s annual survey. Most committee members said they expected Trump\u2019s policies to boost US economic growth in the short-term, but over the medium to long-term they were divided. Some members predict a \u201cboom-bust\u201d economic scenario, expressing concern about the inflationary impact of policies, the ageing population and low productivity. But other committee members expect a sustained boost to growth, with Trump\u2019s policies driving a lift in the potential rate of growth, boosting investment and spurring productivity. The election of Trump has encouraged Australia\u2019s business community to call loudly for business tax cuts. Since Trump plans to cut the US corporate rate to 15%, Australia should at least cut its rate from 30% to 25%, they say. Despite the likelihood that Australia will pass the Netherlands\u2019 growth record this year, the ABE executive committee thinks economic conditions will still be sluggish this year. They think underlying inflation will remain near 2% for the next two years. They expect wages growth to remain weak through 2017 and 2018. They think the unemployment rate will edge slightly lower by the end of 2017 to 5.6%, and then again to 5.5% by the end of 2018. And they expect the budget deficit to improve over 2017 and 2018, with a median forecast deficit of $36.1bn in 2016-17, and $26.6bn for 2017-18. When asked what the policy priorities of the Turnbull government should be in 2017, many committee members highlighted the importance of budget repair. However, a few said the government should not be concerned about losing its AAA sovereign credit rating. They also highlighted the need to prioritise tax reform \u2013 particularly company tax reform \u2013 the goods and services tax, tax concessions and infrastructure spending. Asked about whether higher iron ore prices would prevent the loss of the AAA rating, treasurer Scott Morrison told Sky Business the price had improved since the December mid-year update, which would help the budget if it was a sustained rise. Morrison also reserved the right to draw down on the Future Fund in 2020-21 to help achieve a budget surplus. He noted the ability to draw down from that date was part of the system set up by John Howard and Peter Costello, and under Labor changes those sums were counted in the budget.",

      "bodyText": "The rapid rise in insecure work in the UK is costing the government almost \u00a34bn a year in lost tax income and benefit payouts, according to new research into the gig economy by the Trades Union Congress. The UK\u2019s growing legions of low-paid, self-employed workers and those on zero-hours contracts earn significantly less than regular employees and therefore pay less tax and national insurance. Their relatively low earnings also make them more likely to need to rely on in-work benefits such as tax credits and housing benefit, the TUC said. Taking those factors together translated to a loss to the exchequer of more than \u00a375m a week \u2013 equivalent to more than a quarter of England\u2019s social care budget. \u201cThe huge rise in insecure work isn\u2019t just bad for workers. It\u2019s punching a massive hole in the public finances too,\u201d said TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cZero-hours contracts and low-paid self-employment are costing the economy billions every year in lost tax revenues. That\u2019s money that could be spent on stopping the crisis in our schools and hospitals and making sure every elderly person gets decent care.\u201d The analysis, conducted for the TUC by consultancy Landman Economics, used tax and benefit modelling to gauge the impact of the rise in insecure work since 2006. Official figures show the number of self-employed people in the UK has grown 26% over the last decade to 4.8 million at the last count, or 15% of all people in work. The TUC believes the number of self-employed workers who are low-paid has increased by 21% over the past decade. It classes the bottom 40% of earners within the self-employed as low-paid. Labour market experts attribute some of the rise in self-employment to technological changes that make it easier to start a business and work flexibly. But they also estimate a significant proportion is driven by people feeling they have no choice but to turn to self-employment as more secure work becomes harder to find. The TUC estimates one in 10 workers are now in precarious work and it warns the cost to the public finances from changing employment practices could rise further. O\u2019Grady said the onus was on firms using zero-hours contracts and bogus forms of self-employment, where workers should really be classified as employed, meaning they qualify for all the accompanying protections such as holiday pay and the national living wage. \u201cBosses who employ staff on shady contracts are cheating all of us. That\u2019s why we desperately need more decent jobs that pay a fair wage,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting more people into unions is key. Employees in unionised workplaces are twice as likely to be on better-paid, secure contracts.\u201d The TUC\u2019s estimates chime with warnings made by Matthew Taylor, Theresa May\u2019s adviser on the future of work, on the cost to the public purse from the gig economy. Taylor, appointed by the prime minister to review modern employment practices, said last year that self-employed workers and contractors were paying more than \u00a32,000 less a year on average in tax than employees doing equivalent jobs. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is committed to creating an economy that works for everyone and that is why Matthew Taylor is leading an independent review into whether employment practices need to change in order to keep pace with modern business models. \u201cWe recognise that the tax system also needs to adapt, and the government is considering ways to ensure it remains fair, simple and effective for everyone.\u201d",

Their relatively low earnings also make them more likely to need to rely on in-work benefits such as tax credits and housing benefit, the TUC said.</p> <p>Taking those factors together translated to a loss to the exchequer of more than \u00a375m a week \u2013 equivalent to more than a quarter of England\u2019s social care budget.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/30/zero-hours-workers-1000-worse-off-a-year-than-employees\">Zero-hours workers '\u00a31,000 worse off a year' than employees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe huge rise in insecure work isn\u2019t just bad for workers. It\u2019s punching a massive hole in the public finances too,\u201d said TUC general secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/frances-o-grady\">Frances O\u2019Grady</a>.<br></p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/zero-hours-contracts\">Zero-hours contracts</a> and low-paid self-employment are costing the economy billions every year in lost tax revenues. That\u2019s money that could be spent on stopping the crisis in our schools and hospitals and making sure every elderly person gets decent care.\u201d</p> <p>The analysis, conducted for the TUC by consultancy <a href=\"http://www.landman-economics.co.uk/\">Landman Economics</a>, used tax and benefit modelling to gauge the impact of the rise in insecure work since 2006.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/timeseries/mgrq/lms\">Official figures show the number of self-employed people in the UK has grown 26% over the last decade</a> to 4.8 million at the last count, or 15% of all people in work. The TUC believes the number of self-employed workers who are low-paid has increased by 21% over the past decade. It classes the bottom 40% of earners within the self-employed as low-paid.<br></p> <p>Labour market experts attribute some of the rise in self-employment to technological changes that make it easier to start a business and work flexibly. But they also estimate a significant proportion is driven by people feeling they have no choice but to turn to self-employment as more secure work becomes harder to find.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/aug/20/self-employment-uk-highest-level\">Self-employment in UK at highest level since records began</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The TUC estimates <a href=\"https://www.tuc.org.uk/economic-issues/labour-market/32-million-uk-workers-1-10-are-now-precarious-work\">one in 10 workers are now in precarious work</a> and it warns the cost to the public finances from changing employment practices could rise further. </p> <p>O\u2019Grady said the onus was on firms using zero-hours contracts and bogus forms of self-employment, where workers should really be classified as employed, meaning they qualify for all the accompanying protections such as holiday pay and the national living wage.</p> <p>\u201cBosses who employ staff on shady contracts are cheating all of us. That\u2019s why we desperately need more decent jobs that pay a fair wage,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cGetting more people into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/tradeunions\">unions</a> is key. Employees in unionised workplaces are twice as likely to be on better-paid, secure contracts.\u201d</p> <p>The TUC\u2019s estimates chime with warnings made by Matthew Taylor, Theresa May\u2019s adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/01/i-tell-theresa-may-working-lives-review-modern-employment-zero-hours-flexibility\">on the future of work</a>, on the cost to the public purse from the gig economy.</p> <p>Taylor, appointed by the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/01/theresa-may-hires-former-tony-blair-policy-boss-to-review-workers-rights\">to review modern employment practices</a>, said last year that self-employed workers and contractors were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/30/gig-economy-threatens-government-finances-says-may-adviser\">paying more than \u00a32,000 less a year on average in tax</a> than employees doing equivalent jobs.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is committed to creating an economy that works for everyone and that is why Matthew Taylor is leading an independent review into whether employment practices need to change in order to keep pace with modern business models.<br><br>\u201cWe recognise that the tax system also needs to adapt, and the government is considering ways to ensure it remains fair, simple and effective for everyone.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Champagne drinkers in Britain face higher prices in the next year as the impact of the Brexit vote on the pound takes its toll, the drinks industry has warned. A \u201ctriple whammy\u201d of Brexit, inflation and possible rising alcohol duty is forecast to push up the prices of champagne and prosecco in the UK by \u00a31 and 59p per bottle respectively, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association has warned. Duty on a bottle of still wine in the UK is \u00a32.08, meaning that 55% of the average-priced bottle goes on duty and VAT, while for sparkling wine drinkers duty is 28% higher than still wine. On Valentine\u2019s Day UK couples sharing a bottle of sparkling wine including champagne will pay \u00a32.67 in duty, compared with a couple in France who will spend slightly less than 6p. The UK is the biggest export market for French sparkling wine. Higher inflation, the impact of the pound\u2019s devaluation and the potential for duty increases could be devastating for the wine industry in the coming year, the WSTA says. It predicts that the cost of an average-priced bottle of champagne will go up by 5%, or \u00a31 per bottle, while a bottle of sparkling wine will go up by 9% \u2013 adding another 59p per bottle. An average-priced bottle of still wine sold in the UK could go up by 10%, equating to an additional 53p per bottle. \u201cWith Brexit costing 29p per bottle and rising inflation indicated by the Bank of England last week adding a further 17p, further duty rises could make it a triple whammy for consumers who are already paying a staggering amount of wine and spirit duty,\u201d said Miles Beale, chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. The WSTA is urging the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to make a 2% duty cut in his budget next month. In 2016 Brits bought more than 131m bottles of fizz from UK shops and supermarkets \u2013 up 13% on the previous year. Some of the country\u2019s biggest supermarkets, including Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Waitrose and Morrisons, triggered a price war by applying deep discounts.",
