      "bodyText": "Germany and France scrambled to avoid a major split over Greece on Monday evening as the eurozone delivered a damning verdict on Alexis Tsipras\u2019s landslide referendum victory on Sunday and Angela Merkel demanded that the Greek prime minister put down new proposals to break the deadlock. As concerns mount that Greek banks will run out of cash, and about the damage being inflicted on the country\u2019s economy, hopes for a breakthrough faded. EU leaders voiced despair and descended into recrimination over how to respond to Sunday\u2019s overwhelming rejection of eurozone austerity terms as the price for keeping Greece in the currency. Tsipras, meanwhile, moved to insure himself against purported eurozone plots to topple him and force regime change by engineering a national consensus of the country\u2019s five mainstream parties behind his negotiating strategy, focused on securing debt relief. Tsipras also sacrificed his controversial finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, in what was seen as a conciliatory signal towards Greece\u2019s creditors. In Paris, Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande tried to plot a common strategy after Greeks returned a resounding no to five years of eurozone-scripted austerity. The two leaders were trying to find a joint approach to the growing crisis ahead of an emergency eurozone summit on Tuesday to deal with the fallout. But Merkel said there was no current basis for negotiating with the Greek side and called on Tsipras to make the next move. As eurozone leaders prepared for today\u2019s emergency summit in Brussels, the heads of government were at odds. France, Italy and Spain are impatient for a deal while Germany, the European commission and northern Europe seem content to let Greece stew and allow the euphoria following Sunday\u2019s vote to give way to the sobering realities of bank closures, cash shortages and isolation. Greek banks are to remain closed until Thursday at the earliest, it was announced, with ATM withdrawals rationed to \u20ac60 daily. \u201cThe prospects of a happy resolution of this crisis are rapidly diminishing,\u201d said the British chancellor, George Osborne, after speaking to some of the key policymakers. \u201cIf there is no signal from these meetings that Greece and the eurozone are ready to get around the table again, we can expect the financial situation in Greece to deteriorate rapidly.\u201d The commission had nothing positive at all to say about Sunday\u2019s Greek referendum, while Germany\u2019s increasingly hardline social democratic leader, Sigmar Gabriel, warned that Greece was on the brink of insolvency. He accused Tsipras, the radical leftist prime minister who outmanoeuvred the rest of the eurozone with his plebiscite, of ruthlessly pursuing the Greek national interest at everyone else\u2019s expense. His message suggested a Grexit was now inevitable as he stressed the need for EU humanitarian programmes to forestall social implosion in Greece. Tsipras is expected to table new bailout proposals on Tuesday to eurozone leaders meeting in Brussels after he ditched the flamboyant Varoufakis. Over five months of negotiations, Varoufakis, a leftwing economist and neophyte politician, has rubbed his interlocutors up the wrong way, persistently arguing he is right and everyone else is wrong when it comes to dealing with the Greek debt crisis. The detail of Sunday\u2019s voting patterns left no doubt about the devastating verdict and the challenges it now presents to Europe\u2019s leaders. Around 80% of voters under the age of 34 voted no on Sunday. Germany\u2019s Gabriel said the Greeks had simply rejected the single currency rules, while Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, delivered a cri de coeur lamenting the desperate situation the eurozone and the EU now found themselves in. \u201cTwo political building sites need our work urgently, in European capitals and in Brussels,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we stand still, prisoners of rules, regulations, and bureaucracy, Europe is over. Reconstructing a different Europe will not be easy \u2026 The first one is Greece, a country in very difficult social and economic conditions. Meetings tomorrow will have to indicate a conclusive solution to this emergency.\u201d Merkel has taken a hard line with Greece since Tsipras announced his snap referendum 10 days ago, while the French have been much more accommodating towards Athens. A brief statement issued after the leaders had dined together on Monday evening showed little sign of the two main EU leaders bridging their differences. There were no signs either of movement from the eurozone towards the main demands from Athens \u2013 a new deal writing down the Greek debt mountain, as urged last week by the International Monetary Fund. German government sources said there would be no debt reduction measures offered and that it was up to Greece, which ended negotiations with its creditors 10 days ago and called the referendum, to make the next move. \u201cIn light of the decision by the Greek citizens, the conditions to start negotiations on a new aid programme are not met yet,\u201d said Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Valdis Dombrovskis, the most senior European commission official in charge of the euro, said the referendum result risked leaving everyone a loser. \u201cThe no result unfortunately widens the gulf between Greece and other eurozone countries \u2026 There is no easy way out of this crisis. Too much time and too many opportunities have been lost.\u201d A day of frantic politicking in Greece, and internationally, left few clues as to what happens next. Tsipras has persistently surprised and out-manoeuvred his opposite numbers, but without securing any net gains for a country in the throes of financial collapse. Greece\u2019s bank holiday and the rationing of ATM withdrawals to \u20ac60 a day was extended until at least Thursday. The country\u2019s banks are entirely dependent on the European Central Bank to keep standing and last night the ECB toughened it stance towards Greece\u2019s banks by demanding they put up more collateral in return for the emergency liquidity allowance which has been keeping them afloat. The ECB said its government council is \u201cclosely monitoring the situation in financial markets and the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area\u201d. Tsipras spent much of the day with other Greek party leaders, resulting in the five-party national consensus behind his negotiating strategy committed to debt restructuring. Tsipras\u2019s leftwing Syriza, and his rightwing nationalist coalition partner, Anel, were joined by centre-left Pasok, liberals To Potami, and centre-right New Democracy. Tsipras\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 proposals are likely to lean heavily on his recently tabled third bailout ideas, which call for \u20ac29bn in new loans over a two-year period under the eurozone\u2019s ESM permanent bailout fund, combined with a debt swap that would see the ESM buy up Greece\u2019s obligations to the European Central Bank and convert this into longer-term loans at cheaper rates. Greece would have to commit to many of the austerity measures that were roundly rejected by voters on Sunday. Gabriel, however, emphasised the problems of devising a new bailout under the ESM, whose rules are more exacting than those for the eurozone instrument used for the previous bailouts since 2010. The ESM rules say that a bailout can be considered for a eurozone country if its financial plight imperils the stability of the euro area as a whole. Many argue that this is not the case with Greece, that there is little risk of contagion and destabilisation of the broader currency area. But no one really knows.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cIf you think you are really good, you won\u2019t try to do any better.\u201d Ian Knight is explaining the philosophy behind his company\u2019s pursuit of productivity growth \u2013 something that has eluded so many British businesses in recent years. \u201cWe never quite get to where we want to be. The finish line is always moving.\u201d In a bright, clean factory in Walsall, Knight, a \u201cblack belt\u201d in the ultra-efficient production method six sigma, stands under a sign reading: \u201cEmbrace, enjoy and drive change.\u201d State of the art machinery measures, cuts, strips and crimps cables. All around, Knight\u2019s colleagues are assembling the complex control panels that PP Electrical Systems sells to other manufacturers, to be attached to their own products such as machine tools and food processing equipment. The approach has worked for PP Electrical Systems. It has survived the West Midlands region\u2019s protracted industrial decline, as well as the global financial crisis. Turnover is growing, as is the workforce, now up to 200, but Knight and his colleagues know that only by raising productivity ever further will the manufacturer stay competitive and thrive. Despite solid economic growth since the downturn, Britain has struggled to get more out of each hour worked \u2013 a problem that has become known as the \u2018productivity puzzle\u2019. It is something the chancellor, George Osborne, knows he must tackle if the economic recovery is to get on to a firmer footing and translate into improving living standards. So among the cuts, giveaways and pennies on or off a pint in Wednesday\u2019s budget, productivity will be a key focus. Osborne has his work cut out. The latest official figures last week may have shown productivity, measured as output per hour, picking up in the opening months of this year, but the remarkable absence of productivity growth in the seven years since 2007 has left output per hour about 15% below where it would have been if pre-crisis trends had continued. Experts are divided over the cause of these lost years. Theories include the fact companies kept themselves effectively overstaffed by retaining workers during the recession; that many have relied on bringing in cheap labour rather than making production more efficient; that investment in new machinery, training and innovation has suffered from tight access to loans. Whatever the true combination of factors at work, the UK\u2019s poor record has left it playing catch up with most other industrialised nations. UK productivity lags G7 At PP Electrical Services, the productivity gap has become obvious as it goes after new markets. The manufacturer wants to more than double turnover from \u00a318m to \u00a340m within five years and cracking Germany is key to that, says managing director Tony Hague. But even after revamping production processes and investing in automation and training, the company still has some way to go. \u201cIt\u2019s like we have won the Premier League and are thinking we are quite good and then going into the Champions League and facing Bayern Munich,\u201d Hague says. \u201cWe recognise the fact that to be competitive we need to raise our productivity by 15 to 20%.\u201d But he is optimistic. \u201cIt\u2019s about people, process and automation,\u201d says Hague. \u201cThere is nothing that we do here that is rocket science.\u201d What that means on the factory floor is workers schooled in a culture of \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d. Big TV screens and an \u201cappreciation station\u201d in the canteen celebrate those who have found ways to cut waste along the production line. Rather seek big leaps in productivity, workers at PP Electrical Systems target gains of 6% at a time and are awarded badges proclaiming \u201cRoute 6%, I\u2019m on it.\u201d Knight, whose black belt allows him to lead much of the company\u2019s in-house training, holds up an example of how staff suggestion sheets have helped: After waiting 40 minutes to ask a supervisor what tool to use, one worker recommended that assembly plans list the appropriate tools. Hague admits staff were apprehensive when the factory embarked on its productivity drive with the help of a big Japanese client 14 years ago. \u201cWhen we started standing over people with stopwatches and video recorders, they would say: \u2018What are you doing that for? You are trying to catch me out.\u2019 But if you go for a half hour walk to find a tool, that\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Hague says. \u201cWe had to explain to people it was about the process, not about them. We are not asking them to work harder. We are looking to make their job better. Once people see that and see the benefit to them, they become poacher turned gamekeeper.\u201d The challenge for the government is to use shrinking budgets to help more companies raise their productivity. Alison Phillips, who spent more than 20 years in manufacturing management and now advises companies for the government-backed Business Growth Service says productivity fixes do not have to be costly. \u201cIn all companies you can make changes,\u201d she says. One problem she often identifies is managing directors working on the factory floor rather than stepping back to think about how to raise efficiency and win new clients. \u201cIf you see an MD who is getting their hands dirty and making their own product, they are not running the business,\u201d Phillips says. Another manufacturer, Nigel Stevenson in Derby, is hoping for six-figure gains from relatively simple changes. His sign making company, NCS Fabrications, wants to straighten out an inefficient production line, the result of new machines having been added wherever space was available. \u201cParts are travelling a few hundred yards down and back up \u2026 which wastes time and also hurts the quality,\u201d says Stevenson. On annual turnover of about \u00a33.5m, the family-run company estimates it wastes about \u00a3250,000 and is getting help from the Business Growth Service to cut that. \u201cIf we get lean processes in place we could save \u00a3100,000,\u201d Stevenson says. Simple fixes are all well and good for the manufacturing sector. Indeed, recent research by manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF claimed the sector, at just 10% of the economy, was poised to deliver 40% of Britain\u2019s productivity gains over the next decade \u201cwith the right policies in place\u201d. But the vast majority of the UK economy is made up of the service sector, companies like banks, restaurants and retailers, with far less tangible and less uniform means of production. Improving their productivity is a key challenge for policymakers and businesses themselves. It can be done, says Sarah Windrum, whose company sells technology systems to traditional businesses. \u201cPeople get turned off by the word productivity,\u201d says Windrum, director of Warwickshire-based Emerald Business Communications. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about using technology to provide a better service.\u201d She cites the example of a skip hire company that now uses text messages to tell regular customers about waiting times. What about those companies not dealing in equipment or goods, but entirely reliant on people? Here too, productivity gains can be made, says Alistair Cox, chief executive at Hays recruitment company. He believes training and technology are crucial. \u201cProductivity is a very simple statistic in my business: Amount of fees a consultant books in a month,\u201d Cox says. As the downturn hit in 2008, Hays increased spending on training and on its technology systems so that they now trawl social networks, automating something previously done by recruiters. \u201cIt means freeing up more time for them to speak to people and being a consultant not an administrator,\u201d Cox says. But it does not mean replacing people with machines, he insists. \u201cWe have 10% more employees in the UK than a year ago and they are more productive.\u201d At PP Electrical Systems, Hague is also keen to emphasise that investments in raising productivity have enable the manufacturer to hire more people. \u201cI look at the West Midlands and I can see that what were factory sites are now housing estates and Tesco superstores. Without us investing in change we would have become the site of the next supermarket.\u201d Productivity black belts - what is six sigma? Developed by international telecoms company Motorola in the 1980s, six sigma is a collection of techniques for improving production processes. Companies use it to raise quality and efficiency by spotting and removing causes of defects, and here measuring is the key, whether it is measuring defects, waste or results. Continuous improvement is another cornerstone, meaning workers at all levels of a company constantly look for ways to help raise high-quality output, in other words \u2013 productivity. Businesses such as PP Electrical Systems that have embraced six sigma say it is as much about work culture as specific tools and processes. They use in-house experts with professional qualifications to champion the strategy. With reference to martial arts, those trained in the basics can call themselves yellow belts. Green belts are another notch up and black belts are the experts that lead a company\u2019s six sigma initiatives.",

His sign making company, NCS Fabrications, wants to straighten out an inefficient production line, the result of new machines having been added wherever space was available.</p> <p>\u201cParts are travelling a few hundred yards down and back up \u2026 which wastes time and also hurts the quality,\u201d says Stevenson.<br></p> <p>On annual turnover of about \u00a33.5m, the family-run company estimates it wastes about \u00a3250,000 and is getting help from the Business Growth Service to cut that. \u201cIf we get lean processes in place we could save \u00a3100,000,\u201d Stevenson says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Productivity\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1436201261116/GDP_per_hour.svg&quot;style=\u201dwidth:100%;\u201d&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> <figcaption>Policymakers are puzzling over the UK\u2019s lost years of productivity growth. If the pre-crisis trend for productivity growth had been maintained, output per hour worked would be around 15% higher, as this chart suggests. It shows constant price GDP per hour worked, actuals and projections. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simple fixes are all well and good for the manufacturing sector. Indeed, recent research by manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF claimed the sector, at just 10% of the economy, was <a href=\"http://www.eef.org.uk/about-eef/media-news-and-insights/media-releases/2015/jun/40-per-cent-of-future-productivity-gains-to-come-from-manufacturing-new-analysis-reveals\">poised to deliver 40% of Britain\u2019s productivity gains</a> over the next decade \u201cwith the right policies in place\u201d.</p> <p>But the vast majority of the UK economy is made up of the service sector, companies like banks, restaurants and retailers, with far less tangible and less uniform means of production. Improving their productivity is a key challenge for policymakers and businesses themselves.</p> <p>It can be done, says Sarah Windrum, whose company sells technology systems to traditional businesses. \u201cPeople get turned off by the word productivity,\u201d says Windrum, director of Warwickshire-based Emerald Business Communications. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about using technology to provide a better service.\u201d</p> <p>She cites the example of a skip hire company that now uses text messages to tell regular customers about waiting times.</p> <p>What about those companies not dealing in equipment or goods, but entirely reliant on people? Here too, productivity gains can be made, says Alistair Cox, chief executive at Hays recruitment company. He believes training and technology are crucial. \u201cProductivity is a very simple statistic in my business: Amount of fees a consultant books in a month,\u201d Cox says.</p> <p>As the downturn hit in 2008, Hays increased spending on training and on its technology systems so that they now trawl social networks, automating something previously done by recruiters. </p> <p>\u201cIt means freeing up more time for them to speak to people and being a consultant not an administrator,\u201d Cox says. But it does not mean replacing people with machines, he insists. \u201cWe have 10% more employees in the UK than a year ago and they are more productive.\u201d</p> <p>At PP Electrical Systems, Hague is also keen to emphasise that investments in raising productivity have enable the manufacturer to hire more people. \u201cI look at the West Midlands and I can see that what were factory sites are now housing estates and Tesco superstores. Without us investing in change we would have become the site of the next supermarket.\u201d</p> <h2>Productivity black belts - what is six sigma?</h2> <p>Developed by international telecoms company Motorola in the 1980s, six sigma is a collection of techniques for improving production processes.</p> <p>Companies use it to raise quality and efficiency by spotting and removing causes of defects, and here measuring is the key, whether it is measuring defects, waste or results. </p> <p>Continuous improvement is another cornerstone, meaning workers at all levels of a company constantly look for ways to help raise high-quality output, in other words \u2013 productivity. Businesses such as PP Electrical Systems that have embraced six sigma say it is as much about work culture as specific tools and processes. They use in-house experts with professional qualifications to champion the strategy. </p> <p>With reference to martial arts, those trained in the basics can call themselves yellow belts. Green belts are another notch up and black belts are the experts that lead a company\u2019s six sigma initiatives.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce\u2019s new chief executive, Warren East, has been forced to issue a profit warning on his second day in the job at the engine maker. The defence and aerospace company cut its guidance for annual profit by \u00a375m to between \u00a31.325bn and \u00a31.475bn and said next year\u2019s results would also be weaker than previously expected. The surprise statement on Monday came just weeks before its half-year results on 30 July and was the fourth time the company had issued a profit warning since early last year. The group said as recently as May that it was maintaining its full-year guidance. It scrapped a \u00a31bn share buyback plan halfway through the programme, blaming weaker cashflow, and the company\u2019s share price dropped 9%, later closing down 6% at 802.5p. \u201cThis isn\u2019t exactly how I would have chosen to spend my second day in the job,\u201d East said. \u201cThis news is disappointing for me and for our investors and our employees.\u201d East said profit this year would be reduced by lower customer orders at Rolls-Royce\u2019s marine division, which supplies the offshore oil industry. Sales have been hit by the continuing low oil price, he added. Next year, the civil aerospace business\u2019s profit will be reduced by \u00a3300m mainly because of lower orders and prices for its Trent 700 engines, which are being phased out. Less demand for business jet engines in emerging economies and a weaker market for maintenance of planes will also affect the division. East took over from John Rishton, who announced his retirement in April after a gruelling few years for Rolls-Royce, traditionally seen as one of Britain\u2019s strongest companies and manufacturers. Sales fell for the first time in a decade in 2014, with the company the subject of a Serious Fraud Office investigation into corruption allegations. East ran ARM Holdings, the semiconductor and software design company, for 12 years until 2013. He joined Rolls-Royce as a non-executive director last year. He said a review launched in February this year by Rolls-Royce\u2019s new finance director, David Smith, had shown up weaknesses in how the business compiles its forecasts. As a board member, East knew there were problems and when Smith presented him with the results on Friday a board meeting was called for Sunday. \u201cThat [review] circulated literally in the last week and over the weekend,\u201d East said, adding that the company, which was criticised in the past for poor communication, was reporting its problems earlier and more clearly than previously. The company has previously blamed government defence cuts, a weaker global economy and Russian sanctions, as well as low oil prices for reduced profit guidance. East and Smith said the company was now on a more sure footing. East said it was a coincidence that the profit warning was published when the results of the Greek referendum dominated the news. \u201cThe timing was driven by when this was solidified and, given the size of the numbers involved and the market expectations before we came out with this information, we just had to put it out to the market as soon as possible,\u201d he said. Rolls-Royce has announced 2,600 job cuts that will mostly affect workers at its base in Derby and in Bristol. It added to the jobs toll in May by announcing that a further 600 would go in its marine business, mostly based in Norway. The company said it was looking for further cost cuts in its marine business but East said efficiencies could be made without necessarily shedding workers. A \u00a3200m reduction in civil aerospace profit this year will be offset by accounting benefits before the full effect of lower orders and prices for Trent 700 engines impacts on the division\u2019s earnings next year. East said that the company\u2019s long-term prospects were good and that its order book was at record levels. Rolls-Royce secured its best-ever airline order in April when it agreed a \u00a36.1bn deal to supply 200 Trent 900 engines to Emirates airline. Sandy Morris, an analyst at stockbroker Jefferies, said despite the bad news the warning showed Smith and East were clearing up longstanding uncertainty about how Rolls-Royce reports its results. \u201c[The warning] generates a thumping downgrade in full-year 2016 but leaves us with profits that are less contentious and arguably higher quality in that they generate cash. In some respects, today\u2019s update makes more sense out of things,\u201d Morris said.",

      "bodyText": "Waiting at Berlin\u2019s Zoo station for an S-Bahn train to take her home from a night shift, Diana Well took a glance at the daily papers being sold on the platform. \u201cWhat now, chancellor?\u201d she said, reading out the headline in the tabloid Bild. \u201cYes, that\u2019s just what I\u2019d like to know,\u201d the 54-year-old said. \u201cI work hard, but I try to follow the news as best I can \u2013 Syria, the migrant crisis and Greece \u2013 and I can say while I\u2019m dumbfounded by a lot of what goes on in the world, the situation in Athens just makes me shake my head and has done over five long years.\u201d Looking at front-page photographs of Greeks celebrating their no vote victory against a backdrop of red-coloured fountains, Well asked: \u201cWhy would you celebrate the fact that you\u2019re closer to leaving the euro, unless you have of course been led to believe by your young and dashing prime minister that because of a magic cross in a box, you\u2019re now the controller of your own destiny? It reminds me of the emperor\u2019s new clothes.\u201d \u201cWas nun, Kanzlerin?\u201d as the headline read, is precisely what most Germans appeared to be asking, as Angela Merkel arrived at the chancellery in Berlin ton Monday morning looking tired and distinctly disheveled. While the electric storm that battered much of Germany on Sunday night after the hottest day of the year, might well have contributed to the chancellor\u2019s obvious lack of sleep, it is more likely to have been late-night brainstorming with colleagues in Berlin and Brussels over how to avoid a Grexit that was to blame. The Greek debt crisis \u2013 particularly the past seven days of it \u2013 has been called by some commentators the lowest point in Merkel\u2019s 10-year tenure, and one which could even see her swept out of office, just as signals were being sent that she would like to try for a fourth term in 2017. The German chancellor is coming under increasing pressure within her government to shift from her desire to reach a compromise deal with Athens \u2013 expressed by her oft-repeated phrase that has become akin to her mantra: \u2018Where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way\u2019 \u2013 to a more hardline approach that would envisage a eurozone without Greece. Merkel risks a growing band of rebellious CDU MPs if she does not alter her position, which largely stems from a fear of going down in history as the person who wrecked the European project. Certainly voices against further bailout packages for Greece are growing ever louder within her own conservative bloc and among her coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). The German government\u2019s line was palpably hardened on Monday, with Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert repeating the sentiments of many across the main political parties, when he said it was time for the Greeks to start coming up with answers themselves. \u201cGreece is a member of the euro. It is up to Greece and its government to act so that this can remain the case,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends now on what proposals the Greek government puts on the table.\u201d At the same time Seibert stressed that \u201cthe door is always open for further talks\u201d. The leftwing daily TAZ warned that while Europe\u2019s elite would consider the Greeks\u2019 collective no as a provocation, they should not rush into orchestrating a Grexit. The eurozone would instead be \u201cwell-advised to finally meet the Greeks halfway\u201d, it said. In the south of Germany, the M\u00fcnchner Merkur said that while the government of Alexis Tsipras had \u201cplaced everything on red in their game of Greek roulette, and won\u201d, the victory was pyrrhic. \u201cAs soon as the jubilance in Athens dies down and the government\u2019s propaganda lies have evaporated, the Greeks will realise they have taken a path \u2026 that will not lead to the promised socialist paradise, but back to the drachma,\u201d it said in its main editorial. The Dithmarscher Landeszeitung, from Germany\u2019s North Sea coast, said the Greek government had destroyed any goodwill towards them \u201cby insulting their partners in calling them terrorists and vampires\u201d. It added that Greece\u2019s only option now was to introduce a parallel currency or borrower\u2019s notes. Amid such anger the German government was left with its usual dilemma: whether to take the lead but then face, as it so often has in this crisis, accusations of heavy-handedness bordering on dictatorship; or to stand back and wait for a consensus to form, but then risk being chided for failing to take the initiative as Europe\u2019s largest economy. Merkel will hope that her suppertime meeting with the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in Paris on Monday will at least help to give the impression of a common stance. So far on Monday there has been no word from Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Germany\u2019s finance minister has been at odds with Merkel in recent weeks, after making it plain that he favoured at the very least a temporary exit of Greece from the eurozone, in contrast to her desire to keep on talking and in the event of a yes in Sunday\u2019s referendum, negotiating a third bailout. Last week his popularity ratings had reached an all-time high, with the majority of Germans welcoming his stance while Merkel\u2019s judgment has been increasingly called into question. Hans Michelbach, a representative of small- and medium-sized companies in the CSU, the sister party of Merkel\u2019s CDU, told German radio the Greek people \u201cdid not deserve to have been ... taken hostage by their own government\u201d. He predicted that the rest of Europe would soon be delivering humanitarian aid to Greece, but ruled out the idea of a debt write-off. But G\u00fcnter Verheugen, a member of the SPD and a former EU commissioner, said the European project threatened to fall apart if Berlin did not overcome its fear that to make concessions to Greece would mean other countries would be lining up to receive similar conditions. \u201cI think this is the reason that this row is so bitter and so deep,\u201d he told public radion Deutschlandfunk. \u201cBut it has in the meantime gone so far beyond that, that we really need to be recognising today that our Europe is threatening to fall apart. \u2026 and we cannot let that happen.\u201d The DAX lost about 2% of its value on Monday morning, falling by 10.854 points to 3371, far less than expected, as most German analysts were agreeing the risk of a Grexit had increased. In neighbouring Poland, a survey carried out for the rightwing daily Rzeczpospolita by polling institute Ibris suggested that almost 60% of Poles rejected continued financial support for Greece.",

While the electric storm that battered much of Germany on Sunday night after the hottest day of the year, might well have contributed to the chancellor\u2019s obvious lack of sleep, it is more likely to have been late-night brainstorming with colleagues in Berlin and Brussels over how to avoid a Grexit that was to blame.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/06/greek-referendum-optimism-fades-eurozone-yanis-varoufakis\">Greek referendum: optimism fades as eurozone says gulf has widened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Greek debt crisis \u2013 particularly the past seven days of it \u2013 has been called by some commentators the lowest point in Merkel\u2019s 10-year tenure, and one which could even see her swept out of office, just as signals were being sent that she would like to try for a fourth term in 2017. </p> <p>The German chancellor is coming under increasing pressure within her government to shift from her desire to reach a compromise deal with Athens \u2013 expressed by her oft-repeated phrase that has become akin to her mantra: \u2018Where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way\u2019 \u2013 to a more hardline approach that would envisage a eurozone without Greece. </p> <p>Merkel risks a growing band of rebellious CDU MPs if she does not alter her position, which largely stems from a fear of going down in history as the person who wrecked the European project. Certainly voices against further bailout packages for Greece are growing ever louder within her own conservative bloc and among her coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).</p> <p>The German government\u2019s line was palpably hardened on Monday, with Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert repeating the sentiments of many across the main political parties, when he said it was time for the Greeks to start coming up with answers themselves.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> <blockquote> <p>Greece is a member of the euro.

Germany\u2019s finance minister has been at odds with Merkel in recent weeks, after making it plain that he favoured at the very least a temporary exit of Greece from the eurozone, in contrast to her desire to keep on talking and in the event of a yes in Sunday\u2019s referendum, negotiating a third bailout. Last week his popularity ratings had reached an all-time high, with the majority of Germans welcoming his stance while Merkel\u2019s judgment has been increasingly called into question.</p> <p>Hans Michelbach, a representative of small- and medium-sized companies in the CSU, the sister party of Merkel\u2019s CDU, told German radio the Greek people \u201cdid not deserve to have been ... taken hostage by their own government\u201d. He predicted that the rest of Europe would soon be delivering humanitarian aid to Greece, but ruled out the idea of a debt write-off.</p> <p>But G\u00fcnter Verheugen, a member of the SPD and a former EU commissioner, said the European project threatened to fall apart if Berlin did not overcome its fear that to make concessions to Greece would mean other countries would be lining up to receive similar conditions.</p> <p>\u201cI think this is the reason that this row is so bitter and so deep,\u201d he told public radion Deutschlandfunk. \u201cBut it has in the meantime gone so far beyond that, that we really need to be recognising today that our Europe is threatening to fall apart. \u2026 and we cannot let that happen.\u201d</p> <p>The DAX lost about 2% of its value on Monday morning, falling by 10.854 points to 3371, far less than expected, as most German analysts were agreeing the risk of a Grexit had increased. </p> <p>In neighbouring Poland, a survey carried out for the rightwing daily Rzeczpospolita by polling institute Ibris suggested that almost 60% of Poles rejected continued financial support for Greece. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The arguments being used by the Greek government to secure debt relief can be traced back to a little-reported speech made to the students of Harvard University on 5 June 1947. It was there that George Marshall, the then US secretary of state, floated the idea of a European programme of economic reconstruction. The Americans saw that Europe was on the brink of economic collapse. Industrial capacity had been wiped out. Trade had ceased. People were going hungry and, in Marshall\u2019s view, at risk of turning to communism. Despite being the turning point for Europe\u2019s economies after the second world war, Marshall\u2019s speech was not considered as especially important at the time. The State Department did not bother to tell anybody in Europe about what he was about to say and the British embassy in Washington did not think it worth the cost to send a cable with an advance copy of the speech to London. But the speech was covered by the BBC\u2019s Washington correspondent and, by luck, his report was heard by the then UK foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, in a wireless set he kept by his bedside. Bevin seized on the opportunity provided by the Americans, who said the Europeans had to organise their own plan for disbursing the money. \u201cIt was like a life line to sinking men,\u201d he said later. \u201cIt seemed to bring hope where there was none.\u201d Lessons had been learned from the mistakes made after the first world war. Then, the victorious Allied powers had imposed a punitive peace on Germany, demanding heavy reparations that bred resentment. Marshall tried a different approach. Over four years, the US pumped $13bn into Europe (the equivalent of more than $150bn today) in the hope that it would rebuild economic capacity, enable countries to trade with each other, and rebuff the threat from Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union. It was not an entirely selfless act. The US at the time accounted for 50% of the world\u2019s output, and needed to find markets for its exports. The lack of demand in countries such as France, Italy and Germany in 1947 meant this was not possible. Britain was the single biggest beneficiary of Marshall aid, receiving more than a quarter of the total. Germany took $1.4bn (11% of the total), four times as much as Greece received. Hans Werner-Sinn, the president of the IFO thinktank in Munich, noted three years ago that Marshall aid accounted for 4% of German GDP at the time, while Greece had, even then, received economic assistance worth 200% of its national output. This, though, overlooks two points. The first is Greek resentment at the German occupation during the second world war. As Bevin\u2019s biographer Alan Bullock put it: \u201cGreece was a poor country at the best of times and her economy had been wrecked by the sequence of invasion, occupation, resistance, reprisals and civil war. Eight per cent of the population of seven million had been killed, 10 times the death rate for the UK during the war. The Germans stripped the country of livestock and everything else that could be moved; railways, roads, bridges, ports, had been destroyed.\u201d The second is that direct transfers of money were only part of the help Germany received through the Marshall plan. Far more important than the $1.4bn was the granting of debt relief at the London conference of 1953. Writing in the Economist magazine in 2012, Albrecht Ritschl, a professor of economic history at LSE, said: \u201cThe Marshall plan had an outer shell, the European recovery programme, and an inner core, the economic reconstruction of Europe on the basis of debt forgiveness to and trade integration with Germany. The effects of its implementation were huge. While western Europe in the 1950s struggled with debt/GDP ratios close to 200%, the new West German state enjoyed debt/GDP ratios of less than 20%. This and its forced re-entry into Europe\u2019s markets was Germany\u2019s true benefit from the Marshall plan.\u201d In the days to come, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, will be arguing that was good for Germany in 1953 would be good for Greece in 2015.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hopes of a truce between Athens and its creditors after the Greek referendum\u2019s resounding rejection of the terms of the bailout were fading fast, as European leaders said the gap between the two sides had widened. The surprise resignation of the Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis earlier on Monday had initially boosted hopes of a breakthrough, but the optimism proved shortlived. \u201cThe no result unfortunately widens the gulf between Greece and other eurozone countries,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, the most senior European official in charge of the euro. \u201cThere is no easy way out of this crisis. Too much time and too many opportunities have been lost.\u201d Dombrovskis said \u201cGreece is and remains part of Europe\u201d, but declined to say whether that included being in the euro. Greece had received \u20ac184bn (\u00a3130bn) in bailout funds since 2010, he said, adding that the no result made finding a solution more complicated. \u201cIn the euro area we have 19 democracies, not only one democracy,\u201d said Dombrovskis, a former prime minister of Latvia, one of the newest entrants to the currency union. The German chancellery warned that conditions for new talks with Greece had not been met. \u201cThe government takes notice of the clear no vote and respects it,\u201d Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said. \u201cHowever, in light of the decision by the Greek citizens, the conditions to start negotiations on a new aid programme are not met yet.\u201d Merkel will head to Paris for crisis talks with her counterpart Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in an effort to forge a common Franco-German response, setting the stage for an emergency summit of all 19 eurozone leaders on Tuesday. Time is fast running out for Greece, with its banks almost out of money. Daily withdrawals remain capped at \u20ac60, but some people can get no more than \u20ac50, ostensibly because \u20ac20 notes have run out. The Greek government promised that banks will reopen on Tuesday, but this looks increasingly unlikely, as the European Central Bank is expected to withhold further emergency funding when it meets later on Monday. According to Greek television, the country\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tispras, is taking a break from marathon meetings with party leaders to take a call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe treat with respect the voice raised during the plebiscite,\u201d Putin\u2019s spokesman said. Greece might be discussed on the sidelines of a Brics summit in Ufa, in the Russian federal republic of Bashkortostan , on Wednesday, bringing together leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The tough line from Berlin and Brussels underscores how a north-south divide is emerging in Europe over how to deal with the crisis. Governments, including Germany, Slovakia and Finland, want Greece to sign up to tough reforms in exchange for financial aid. But southern European countries have struck a more emollient tone. Italy\u2019s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has called for talks to resume. \u201cThere is no escape from the Greek labyrinth with a Europe that is weak and without growth.\u201d Spain\u2019s finance minister, Luis de Guindos, said everyone wants Greece to stay in the euro, although a no vote made the situation more complicated. Spain\u2019s governing People\u2019s party, which faces a challenge from the insurgent Podemos movement in elections later this year, is treading carefully, as it has used Greece\u2019s plight to justify its own austerity policies. The leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, welcomed the referendum result: \u201cThe citizens of Greece have said that austerity isn\u2019t the way to end the economic crisis.\u201d The EU establishment blames Greece\u2019s radical left government for deepening the economic crisis since it came to power in January, an argument that Dombrovskis reiterated. \u201cOnly eight months ago Greece was ready to turn the page,\u201d Dombrovksis said. \u201cRegrettably the current Greek government was not able to use this extension [on its bailout] to produce a credible strategy to come out of this crisis, regain financial stability and return to economic growth.\u201d This echoed the verdict of the International Monetary Fund, which slammed the Tsipras government for failing to reform the economy, in a policy paper that warned Greece would need debt relief and a new bailout worth \u20ac60bn. Denying reports that the European commission had tried to suppress this report, Dombrovskis sought to turn the focus back on Athens and its failure to stick to the terms of previous bailout programmes. He repeated earlier criticism that the vote was \u201cnot correct\u201d because Greeks had voted on a package that had already expired.",

      "bodyText": "New car sales rose to a record first-half high as buyers took advantage of finance deals and low interest rates to purchase the latest models. Registrations rose 7% to 1.38m in the first six months of the year, marking the 40th month in a row of rising sales, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said on Monday. The figure was 324 higher than the previous record in the first half of 2004. In June, sales rose 12.9% to 257,817 vehicles. Car sales rose even while the economy was in the doldrums and living standards fell as manufacturers offered deals that allowed buyers to lease cars and then trade them in. The SMMT said those deals combined with new, improved models had kept demand high. First-half sales of British-built cars were the strongest for five years, with one in six buyers opting for such vehicles. The UK-built Vauxhall Astra, Nissan Qashqai and Mini were among the overall top 10 sellers. Mike Hawes, SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see more consumers choosing British models. This is important for the wider economy with 799,000 people now employed across the UK automotive sector, including retail.\u201d Manufacturers including Honda and Jaguar Land Rover announced more than \u00a31bn of investment in the UK car industry in March after 2014 proved to be the sector\u2019s best year since the financial crisis. A larger range of models and a greater number of plug-in charge points helped push sales of such vehicles up 71% in June to 7,110. A \u00a35,000-a-car government grant to encourage sales of electric vehicles has almost reached its limit of 50,000, the SMMT said. There had also been a surge in demand for electric and hybrid vehicles. The top seller in the first half of 2015 was the perennially popular Ford Fiesta, followed by the Vauxhall Corsa and the Ford Focus. Hawes said he expected overall sales growth to be weaker in the second half of the year as the market slipped back closer to its normal rate. Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cJune\u2019s gain is all the more impressive as the gains are now coming from a high base. The car industry will be hoping that there is no major fallout from events in Greece that weighs down appreciably on business and consumer confidence and foster caution over buying big ticket items such as cars.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "What\u2019s next for the Greek banks? Greece\u2019s financial system is on the brink of meltdown: banks are reported to have only around \u20ac500m left in cash \u2013 equal to just \u20ac45 (\u00a332) per head of the 11 million-strong population. The big question is whether the European Central Bank will increase the flow of emergency aid to Greek banks. The ECB has already pumped \u20ac89bn into Greek banks, but paused this emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) before Sunday\u2019s referendum. Although the result is now clear, the ECB will be reluctant to act ahead of European leaders, who are meeting on Monday and Tuesday. Sources told Reuters that the ECB would not raise the \u20ac89bn cap at the telephone conference on Monday. The ECB is unlikely to pull support from Greece altogether. \u201cThe day the ECB cuts off ELA is de facto the day that Greece would leave the euro,\u201d say analysts at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. The ECB, fearful of straying into politics, will not make that momentous decision without the say-so of European leaders. Where does this leave the bailout negotiations? The dramatic resignation of Greece\u2019s flamboyant finance minister Yanis Varoufakis on Monday morning instantly boosted hopes of a deal. In his resignation statement, Varoufakis said the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras judged his \u201cabsence\u201d from Eurogroup meetings \u201cto be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement\u201d. The markets agreed, strengthening the euro against the dollar. Eurozone leaders had pushed for Varoufakis to go, but it is far from clear it will be any easier for them to strike a deal with his successor, widely expected to be Greece\u2019s chief negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos. European leaders are calling on Athens to make the first move. French finance minister Michel Sapin said it was up to the Greek government \u201cto make new proposals as quickly as possible\u201d. Finland\u2019s finance minister Alexander Stubb said talks could only restart when Greece cooperates and commits to implementing necessary reforms. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will head to Paris for talks on Monday evening with French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in an effort to forge a common line ahead of an emergency summit of all 19 eurozone leaders on Tuesday. So far, the two leaders have taken different approaches: Merkel closed the door to further talks before Sunday\u2019s referendum, but Hollande wanted a quick agreement. Technical talks are also under way in Brussels, while the heads of the European creditor organisations \u2013 the European commission, the ECB and the eurozone \u2013 are also discussing the situation. What are the markets doing? Stock markets across Europe have fallen, but are not plunging off a cliff. France\u2019s CAC 40 is down 1.5%, the German DAX 1.4%, while Italy\u2019s FTMIB has lost 2.65%. Outside the eurozone, the FTSE 100 is down by 0.5%. Across Asia, where investors are also nervous about a slowdown in the Chinese economy, it was a similar story. \u201cThe Greece no vote is a surprise,\u201d said Shoji Hirakawa at Okasan Securities in Tokyo. \u201cBut the key is that the direction is going toward more talks after this.\u201d The bond markets are more volatile, but price spikes were contained by the expectation that the ECB will continue to buy government bonds of vulnerable southern European countries. Spanish 10-year yields were up marginally at 2.3%, Italy\u2019s at 2.32% and Portugal at 3%. The muted reaction from markets may reflect investors\u2019 perception that a Grexit is more likely, but unlikely to have disastrous consequences for the eurozone. Is Greece more likely to leave the euro? The next 48 hours will test Tsipras\u2019s argument that a no vote would strengthen his hand with negotiators. The Economist Intelligence Unit puts the chances of a Grexit at 60%. \u201cThe referendum result raises the stakes for both sides. It makes it more difficult for Mr Tsipras to make big concessions in order to reach agreement with the country\u2019s creditors. It also makes it more difficult for German chancellor Angela Merkel and other eurozone leaders to make concessions to Greece because of the moral hazard arguments,\u201d says the EIU\u2019s Joan Hoey. What about the UK? In the UK, the chancellor, George Osborne, is holding crisis meetings with the prime minister, David Cameron, and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. The governor had already been attending meetings of Cobra \u2013 behind-the-scenes talks at the highest level of government \u2013 as the Greece crisis deepened last week and said that contingency plans for a potential Grexit are being put in place. The government could face further pressure to speed up the timetable to renegotiate the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, something likely to be very unwelcome to the rest of Europe. \u201cThe prime minister may get an early, and important, opportunity to put the case for fundamental reform of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU,\u201d said John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. \u201cBusinesses will want him to seize this opening.\u201d When is the next deadline? The clock is ticking down to 20 July when Greece must repay \u20ac3.5bn to the ECB. For many, this really is the final deadline. Missing this payment would have far more catastrophic consequences than last week\u2019s unprecedented default to the IMF. If Greece defaults to the ECB, the Frankfurt institution will most likely turn off all life support for the banks in Greece. Banks will collapse, Greece will be forced out of the euro and relations with the rest of Europe could become even worse.",

The ECB, fearful of straying into politics, will not make that momentous decision without the say-so of European leaders.</p> <h2><strong>Where does this leave the bailout negotiations?</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/06/greek-finance-minister-yanis-varoufakis-resigns-despite-referendum-no-vote\">dramatic resignation of Greece\u2019s flamboyant finance minister Yanis Varoufakis </a>on Monday morning instantly boosted hopes of a deal.<br></p> <p><a href=\"http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/07/06/minister-no-more/\">In his resignation statement</a>, Varoufakis said the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras judged his \u201cabsence\u201d from Eurogroup meetings \u201cto be potentially helpful to him in reaching an agreement\u201d. The markets agreed, strengthening the euro against the dollar.</p> <p>Eurozone leaders had pushed for Varoufakis to go, but it is far from clear it will be any easier for them to strike a deal with his successor, widely expected to be Greece\u2019s chief negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos.</p> <p>European leaders are calling on Athens to make the first move. French finance minister Michel Sapin said it was up to the Greek government \u201cto make new proposals as quickly as possible\u201d. Finland\u2019s finance minister Alexander Stubb said talks could only restart when Greece cooperates and commits to implementing necessary reforms.</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will head to Paris for talks on Monday evening with French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, in an effort to forge a common line ahead of an emergency summit of all 19 eurozone leaders on Tuesday. So far, the two leaders have taken different approaches: Merkel closed the door to further talks before Sunday\u2019s referendum, but Hollande wanted a quick agreement.</p> <p>Technical talks are also under way in Brussels, while the heads of the European creditor organisations \u2013 the European commission, the ECB and the eurozone \u2013 are also discussing the situation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"081b6d64e286967848707c8ccd3ec27ef4bc73c5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436176506290/16f30437-058b-47ab-a5a7-2bc86b4522a5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Korea Composite Stock Price Index in Seoul.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Korea Composite Stock Price Index in Seoul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ahn Young-joon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What are the markets doing?</h2> <p>Stock markets across Europe have fallen, but are not plunging off a cliff.

It makes it more difficult for Mr Tsipras to make big concessions in order to reach agreement with the country\u2019s creditors. It also makes it more difficult for German chancellor Angela Merkel and other eurozone leaders to make concessions to Greece because of the moral hazard arguments,\u201d says the EIU\u2019s Joan Hoey.</p> <h2><strong>What about the UK?</strong></h2> <p>In the UK, the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a>, is holding crisis meetings with the prime minister, David Cameron, and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. The governor had already been attending meetings of Cobra \u2013 behind-the-scenes talks at the highest level of government \u2013 as the Greece crisis deepened last week and said that contingency plans for a potential Grexit are being put in place.</p> <p>The government could face further pressure to speed up the timetable to renegotiate the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, something likely to be very unwelcome to the rest of Europe.</p> <p>\u201cThe prime minister may get an early, and important, opportunity to put the case for fundamental reform of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU,\u201d said John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. \u201cBusinesses will want him to seize this opening.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>When is the next deadline?</strong></h2> <p>The clock is ticking down to 20 July when Greece must repay \u20ac3.5bn to the ECB. For many, this really is the final deadline. Missing this payment would have far more catastrophic consequences than last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras\">unprecedented default to the IMF</a>. If Greece defaults to the ECB, the Frankfurt institution will most likely turn off all life support for the banks in Greece. Banks will collapse, Greece will be forced out of the euro and relations with the rest of Europe could become even worse.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Barnaby Joyce has accused state governments and mining companies of being \u201cfar too greedy\u201d on coal seam gas exploration and getting it wrong. The agricultural minister also suggested there should be no coal seam gas mining on any prime agricultural land, water aquifers should be protected and fair prices should be paid to the community and landowners. In a wide-ranging speech delivered at the National Press Club on Monday in which he argued the government\u2019s case for the agriculture white paper, Joyce described the \u201cavant garde\u201d approach of some animal rights groups as \u201cnihilism\u201d. He also defended the Coalition\u2019s changes to foreign investment rules which drop the review threshold to $15m, suggesting he had not seen any weakening of demand by foreign investors. The $1.2bn agriculture white paper, which was released on Saturday, announced a range of new measures, including $500m for water infrastructure and dams, extensions for farm concessional loans, an agricultural commissioner in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to oversee fair trading conditions for suppliers, primarily aimed at big supermarkets, and changes to the rules for farm management deposits (FMDs). At the same time, Joyce was caught up in a storm over his planned appearance on Q&amp;A on Monday night, after the prime minister\u2019s office forbade him from appearing on the show following the controversy over Zaky Mallah. Although it was raised in the preceding green paper, the white paper does not touch on coal seam gas exploration, which remains a political flashpoint in some areas between farmers, miners and state governments which have responsibility for land usage. The NSW National party lost one and almost two seats on the far north coast of NSW over the issue at the state election and has urged a CSG ban in the area. Joyce is under pressure in his own seat of New England, with the federal environment minister Greg Hunt yet to decide whether the Chinese state-owned mega-coalmine Shenhua can go ahead. Under the water trigger legislation \u2013 which the Coalition is seeking to remove \u2013 Hunt has to decide whether the water aquifer under prime agricultural land in the Liverpool Plains is at risk from the mine. The deadline for his decision is Thursday. \u201cThe mines got it wrong and the state governments got it wrong,\u201d said Joyce with regard to CSG. \u201cThey all got it wrong because they got too greedy, they got far too greedy. You must make sure a fair return goes back to the farmer. \u201cBecause they didn\u2019t walk up and do the business and were fair in the application of how they dealt with those farmers, the mining company lost the delivery of those sweet spots in the delivery of those minerals. They lost it. \u201cIf they dealt in a fair way then they\u2019d have their product online. There has to be a fair return to the lives of the people who it ultimately affects.\u201d The shadow agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said Labor (at the urging of Joyce\u2019s predecessor Tony Windsor) put in place rigorous approval processes, which allowed the federal government to examine resource project effects on flora, fauna and water. \u201cWe ensured that water problems were considered independent of states but the Coalition\u2019s policy is to send that approval back to states,\u201d Fitzgibbon said. Joyce said while it would be mad to shut down the coal seam gas industry, guidelines were necessary, including a ban on CSG on prime agricultural land, a responsibility not to destroy water aquifers and a responsibility to deliver a fair return to the community. \u201cDon\u2019t destroy aquifers, that\u2019s stating the bleeding obvious,\u201d he said. \u201cAquifers are a public asset. So many people in so many areas rely on them. They don\u2019t just rely on them in that area, they rely on them downstream and around and everywhere. \u201cDon\u2019t usurp the quiet enjoyment of people who were there first. You can\u2019t set up an industrial park next to someone\u2019s house. Or you shouldn\u2019t be able to. \u201cThere has to be a fair return to the community. If the community sees all this action going on around it, then it would expect its hospitals to be fixed and its schools to be refurbished and its roads to be sealed.\u201d Joyce also raised concerns with the methods of animal rights activists and the definition of free-range eggs. State and federal ministers are trying to determine a national standard for free-range eggs which fits with the consumer\u2019s understanding of free range. He said some \u201cavant garde\u201d animal activists\u2019 definition of \u201cethical\u201d was actually \u201cnihilism\u201d to some producers. \u201cTo those who actually live in the industry, it\u2019s nihilism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes them out of production. \u201cWe have discussions all the time about what is a free-range egg. You can\u2019t force a chook out of a shed. If a chook wants to stay in an air-conditioned shed it stays in an air-conditioned shed. They\u2019re not like kids, you can\u2019t force them out to play. We have branding issues.\u201d Joyce also defended the government\u2019s treatment of foreign investment, which was welcome \u201cwhere it is not contrary to Australia\u2019s national interest\u201d. The Coalition has reduced the Foreign Investment Review Board screening threshold in agricultural land to $15m, and is introducing a new $55m threshold for agribusiness, though it excludes certain countries where limits in trade agreements apply. \u201cBona fide investors are still lined up out the door,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I went to Beef Week, it was like a mosh pit and not one person was saying they were scared of the controls. They were absolutely wanting to invest but I have to be able to sell to the Australian people a sense that we have control of this. \u201cWhen I can\u2019t say to the Australian people we don\u2019t actually know who owns what, that\u2019s not a good starting point for any debate. And we\u2019ve got to show that first and foremost we are backing in the Australian people.\u201d Fitzgibbon said while the government was talking up free trade agreements and publicly encouraging foreign investment, it was changing the thresholds and increasing the fees for foreign investors. \u201cThe competition for global capital is intense,\u201d he said, \u201cand anything that represents a barrier makes us less competitive.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Emergency intervention by the Chinese government appeared to partially stabilise its plunging stock markets on Monday with early trading showing some positive results. Within the first ten minutes of trading, Shanghai\u2019s stock index had risen almost 8% although those gains dropped to 3.23% within an hour. It then went into negative territory before rebounding to close over 2% up. Beijing announced measures over the weekend to try to prevent more losses on the stock markets which have seen falls of 30% over the past three weeks, including 12% last week. China\u2019s stock markets had previously been among the top performing in the world and had hit a 7-year peak in the middle of June. The Shanghai stock market had surged more than 150% in 12 months. State media reported that over the weekend that the Chinese government, along with the securities regulator and financial institutions had launched a joint effort to prevent more losses. China\u2019s 21 biggest brokerages announced that they would buy at least 120bn yuan (\u00a312.3bn) of shares to help prevent a fresh market slump. New share offerings were also suspended on orders of the State Council. Twenty-eight Chinese companies which had obtained permission for initial public offerings announced on Sunday that they would postpone follow-up issues of shares. Meanwhile the People\u2019s Bank of China made a commitment to provide liquidity for state-back lender China Securities Finance Corp, a state owned company which provides margin loads to brokerages. Analysts seemed confident the actions would have an ongoing positive impact on China\u2019s stock markets. Shao Yu, chief economist with Orient Securities said the actions taken were clever. \u201cI think it will stabilise the market, of course there will be some fluctuation but more and more money put into the market, I think it will be helpful to keep the market steady,\u201d Shao said. However he added that he didn\u2019t expect the market to reach the heights it had previously. Previous efforts to keep share prices from falling, including interest-rate cuts and plans to investigate short sellers proved unsuccessful. The Shanghai stock market has lost \u00a31.8 trillion in market value over the past three weeks. China\u2019s stock market is made up of mostly individual investor rather than institutional investors. Almost 90 million people hold shares, and up to 1.4 million new investors a week open stock accounts. According to media estimates, the average loss of individual stock accounts has been around 420,000 yuan. The Greek no vote in the bailout referendum was expected to have some impact. \u201cIt will cause a lot of worry,\u201d said Shao. \u201cBut because we already had this kind of stress test, I think the authorities must prepare enough weapons for this kind of move.\u201d Meanwhile, a man was detained by police in Beijing for allegedly spreading a rumour that someone had committed suicide due to the stock market slump. The 29-year-old man, a project manager with a technology company, had posted the information along with video clips and screenshots, according to the state news agency Xinhua. His post quickly spread and provoked a lot of online debate, particularly among those who had invested on the stock market.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s the end of our coverage of Greek Referendum Day. But my colleague Helen Davidson is already up and running with a new liveblog, tracking how Asia\u2019s financial markets react to the No landslide. She already has the latest views from Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at insurance giant Allianz, so don\u2019t miss it: Thank you for reading and commenting, in such huge numbers. It\u2019s been great to have you with us. Goodnight. GW What a sensational day. Time for another recap. Greece has delivered a resounding No to its creditors, in a move that has stunned the eurozone tonight and may shake the financial markets. In the last few minutes, the last ballot papers were counted. And No campaign has exceeded all expectations by securing 61.31% of the vote [here\u2019s the official count]. As our interactive shows, every area of Greece has voted to reject the proposals of Greece\u2019s creditors and seek a better deal. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has declared that it\u2019s a historic day for Greece, which shows that democracy cannot be blackmailed. In a TV address, Tsipras has also vowed to begin negotiations with creditors to reach a sustainable deal to tackle Greece\u2019s debt crisis. \u201cYou made a very brave choice. \u201cThe mandate you gave me is not the mandate of a rupture with Europe, but a mandate to strengthen our negotiating position to seek a viable solution.\u201d Tsipras will meet with other political leaders at 8am BST on Monday morning, as thousands of jubilant No campaigners head to bed after celebrating the result in Athens, and beyond. Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone looks more perilous than ever, and the next 48 hours could be critical. On Monday, the European Central Bank will meet to discuss the emergency liquidity provided to Greek banks (which is currently capped, forcing capital controls to be imposed a week ago). German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande will meet in Paris on Monday night. In the UK, prime minister David Cameron will meet with Chancellor George Osborne and governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney to discuss the impact on Britain\u2019s financial stability. Then on Tuesday, eurozone leaders will debate the crisis at an emergency summit. Eurozone finance ministers will hold a Eurogroup meeting that afternoon. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijssebloem has already criticised the result of the referendum, warning: \u201cI take note of the outcome of the Greek referendum. This result is very regrettable for the future of Greece.\u201d But democratic senator Bernie Sanders has hailed the result as a decisive vote against austerity. A series of financial analysts have warned tonight that Greece is likely to exit the eurozone. As Barclays warned: \u201cWhile Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande are scheduled to meet tomorrow, we argue that EMU exit now is the most likely scenario\u2026.\u201d Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, though, has denied this is an option: And the world\u2019s stock markets are expected to suffer falls when trading begins. The FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares is tipped to drop by over 2%, and the euro has already lost around 1% against the US dollar, even before Asian trading gets fully underway. The last ballot paper has just been counted in Greece, and the No campaign have stormed to a dramatic victory. The final result is No: 61.31%, and Yes with 38.69% One for the history books: Police say about 100-150 anarchist protesters have started throwing firebombs at riot police and setting trash cans on fire in the central Athens neighborhood of Exarcheia, Associated Press reports: The Greek referendum has gripped Europe, and beyond today. This map shows how Google users worldwide have been searching for information. Here\u2019s the Guardian front page story on Sunday\u2019s referendum drama: It begins: Greece delivered a landslide no vote to the eurozone\u2019s terms for the country remaining in the single currency on Sunday night, unleashing a seismic political shift that could derail the European project. The verdict confronts the EU\u2019s leadership with one of its most severe crises of confidence and leaves Greece facing potential financial collapse and exit from the euro. In a polarising referendum called by the radical leftist government of Alexis Tsipras at only eight days notice, Greeks voted by more than 60% to 40% in support of the prime minister, spurning the extra austerity demanded mainly by Germany and the International Monetary Fund in return for an extension of bailout funds. Tsipras said that Greece \u201chas proved that democracy cannot be blackmailed; Greece has made a brave choice and one which will change the debate in Europe. Live Greek referendum: Alexis Tsipras hails victory for No campaign - live updatesWith most votes counted, Greece has given a resounding No to the proposals from its creditorsRead more \u201cI understand that votors have not given me a mandate against Europe, but a mandate for a sustainable future.\u201d He warned, though, that there would be \u201cno easy solutions\u201d. Five years of failed austerity policies in Greece and a total breakdown in trust between the leftwing Syriza alliance and the political leaders of its creditors climaxed in a national vote in which Greeks said no to the spending cuts and tax increases demanded by its lenders.... And here\u2019s the full story: More photos from Athens.... After a truly sensational day, the Athens capital is calming down as the clocks strike 2am.... The meeting of Greek political leaders is scheduled for 10am Monday in Athens, or 8am UK time. Monday\u2019s meeting of Greek party political leaders may be dominated by a call for finance minister Yanis Varoufakis to be removed from the country\u2019s negotiating team. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: The head of the centrist Potami party, Stavros Theodorakis, has signalled he will ask for the academic-cum-politician\u2019s immediate withdrawal from the team \u2013 citing irreconcilable differences with Greece\u2019s creditors. This is going to be a big ask. Tsipras is very close (some say enormously dependent) on his finance minister and has stood by him despite growing unease with Varoufakis\u2019 tactics in his own Syriza party. Both men have been enormously vindicated by tonight\u2019s result. The historic Greek referendum is the splash on almost all the UK front pages on Monday, and across Europe too: Only a final handful of votes are still to be counted in Greece. Around 96% of ballot papers have now been processed, with the No side bobbing around the 61.3% mark. If you\u2019re been watching the crisis closely, you\u2019ll already know that Greece submitted a request for a third bailout last week, and said it would accept some of its creditors demands (but not all) Newsnight\u2019s Duncan Weldon suggests this could be the basis for a deal: Our data editor, Alberto Nardelli, sums up the grim choice facing eurozone leaders at their emergency summit on Tuesday: Alexis Tsipras has told Greece\u2019s president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, that the country needs \u2018a strong national front\u2019 (no, not that sort!) to negotiate a way out of its debt crisis. At tonight\u2019s meeting, Tsipras told Pavlopoulos: \u201cWe must move forward immediately with negotiations.... a strong national front must be created to seek an immediate solution.\u201d (via Reuters) And Pavlopoulous told Tsipras that tonight\u2019s vote does not mean Greece wants to leave the eurozone, local reporters say: Tonight, we dance..... European Council president Donald Tusk has confirmed that eurozone leaders will meet on Tuesday night to discuss Greece. You can almost see Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup (euro finance ministers), shaking his head in dismay as he digests the news from Greece tonight. He has just issued a brief statement, in which he confirms that the Eurogroup will meet on Tuesday to prepare for the Eurozone leaders meeting on Tuesday (which Merkel and Hollande have already called) Dijsselbloem says: I take note of the outcome of the Greek referendum. This result is very regrettable for the future of Greece. For recovery of the Greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable. We will now wait for the initiatives of the Greek authorities. The Eurogroup will discuss the state of play on Tuesday 7 July. Greece is now in a race against time to reach a deal with creditors before its banking system collapses, say analysts at JP Morgan. And here\u2019s a handy chart from Barclays (as flagged earlier, they reckon Greece is now likely to leave the eurozone:) US senator Bernie Sanders has warmly welcomed the referendum result. \u201cI applaud the people of Greece for saying \u2018no\u2019 to more austerity for the the poor, the children, the sick and the elderly.\u201d \u201cIn a world of massive wealth and income inequality Europe must support Greece\u2019s efforts to build an economy which creates more jobs and income, not more unemployment and suffering.\u201d Sanders, who describes himself as a \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d, is running for the Democratic nomination to succeed Barack Obama as president... Unsurprisingly, the religious development organization Jubilee USA, has applauded tonight\u2019s referendum verdict. Eric LeCompte, executive director, says: \u201cGreeks watched a third of their population pushed under the poverty line because of austerity programs over the last 5 years. Today, Greeks voted for debt relief. And the solution, as IMF reported last week, is debt relief and a long break before repayments kick in: As LeCompte puts it: \u201cAusterity in exchange for financing doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s like treating an injured person with beatings. Unless we establish a global bankruptcy process for countries, we\u2019ll continue to see more situations like Greece around the world.\u201d No supporters have also celebrated in front of the White Tower in Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second city, tonight. An overwhelmingly youthful crowd thronged Syntagma Square beneath the Greek parliament tonight, writes Daniel Howden. Among the young revellers were Eleni Konstantinou and her husband Nikos Neoudakis. She has been supporting a family of three on her salary as a secondary school teacher and said the\u201dno\u201d vote was the proudest day of my life.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve fought for the left for so many years. Fought the corruption.\u201d As repeated chants of \u201cno\u201d rang through the square Konstantinou said she expected a better deal on the other side of the referendum landslide. \u201cI have total faith in Alexis Tsipras, he won\u2019t let us down.\u201d She said that the demonstrations around Europe in support of the \u201cno\u201d vote had been deeply moving. \u201cThat is solidarity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is Europe.\u201d A familiar scene in Greece tonight, as queues form at the cash machines: The CBI, which represents British businesses, has issued a statement on Greece: CBI Director-General John Cridland says: \u201cWhile the UK economy\u2019s direct exposure to Greece is minimal, we are not immune to wider Eurozone risks. We must now encourage all leaders, particularly those of the Troika, to act decisively to agree a deal, providing certainty for Greece and the wider Eurozone. \u201cEurope\u2019s policymakers should not hesitate to use every tool at their disposal to preserve growth and stability throughout the Eurozone.\u201d (they\u2019re not called the Troika any more, John! It\u2019s the \u2018Institutions\u2019) George Saravelos, analyst at Deutsche Bank, was quick out of the blocks with his views on the no vote. He says the Bank of Greece is currently holding a conference call with the Greek banks to establish how much cash they have left. The focus is on the European Central Bank and what it will do about the \u20ac89bn of emergency liquidity assistance it has been using to keep Greek banks afloat. \u201cOver the next few hours, both sides\u2019 willingness to re-start negotiations and under what conditions remains the most important next step. Beyond that, it is the increasing pressure on the Greek economy and people via a frozen banking system and capital controls that will drive the speed of developments. Decisions have to be taken soon on whether to return to the path of negotiations or consider the alternative of a Eurozone exit\u201d. He sees three immediate issues: \u201cFirst, the vote marks a big political victory for PM Tsipras. Today\u2019s vote will allow the PM to maintain the political initiative within Greece, re-enforcing his leadership within the party as well as the government. It will be perceived by the government as a strong backing around its tough negotiating strategy. Second, the poll masks a deeply divided electoral body. The win to the \u201cno\u201d vote was decisive. But opinion polls over the last few days have continued to show an overwhelming support for euro membership. How this can be reconciled with the \u201cno\u201d vote and rising economic costs remains to be seen in coming days. Either way, the referendum process itself and the outcome has increased polarization in Greece. Political tension both within parliament and in potential political demonstrations will be ongoing and unpredictable. Third, the referendum result now requires Europe to more formally adopt a position on Greece, particularly given the size of the \u201cno\u201d. The European message on whether rejection is equivalent to Eurozone exit has not been consistent, with both Merkel and Schauble in particular not adopting this interpretation. A more clear reaction from Eurozone members should now be expected.\u201d Barclays analysts have issued a research note, warning that Greece is likely to leave the euro. They write: \u201cWhile Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande are scheduled to meet tomorrow, we argue that EMU exit now is the most likely scenario\u2026.\u201d The Barclays team also expect the ECB to pull that much needed emergency liquidity funding before July 20. when Greece faces a major debt repayment.\u201d \u201cThe ECB Governing Council will meet on Monday to decide on ELA. We would expect ECB\u2019s GC to shut down ELA at the latest by 20 July. Assuming that all of the pledged collateral at the ECB is recorded at (close to) par on Greek banks\u2019 balance sheets and that current average haircut on collateral is 50%, then retention of the collateral by the Eurosystem would translate into a more than \u20ac30bn loss for the banks. This alone would wipe out shareholders\u2019 equity. The Greek central bank will eventually need to print its own currency in order to inject new liquidity and capital\u201d. The European Commission has issued a statement, saying it \u201ctakes note of and respects the result of the referendum in Greece\u201d. It also reveals that Jean-Claude Juncker is now speaking with all eurozone leaders, and other key figures in Europe. President Juncker is consulting tonight and tomorrow with the democratically elected leaders of the other 18 Eurozone members as well as with the Heads of the EU institutions. He will have a conference call among the \u201cEuro-Institutionals\u201d (with the President of the Euro Summit, the President of the Euro Group and the President of the European Central Bank) on Monday morning. He intends to address the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s team have tweeted the key points from his speech, in English: News coming in that Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, will meet with the country\u2019s head of state, president Prokopis Pavlopoulos in the next half hour, reports Helena Smith. He will ask the president to convene an emergency meeting of party leaders tomorrow Monday ahead of a EU summit meeting Greek insiders are confirming will take place Tuesday. Speculation is rife tonight that the leftist-led government may buttress the Greek negotiating team with members of the political opposition who creditors may find more palatable to deal with in the days ahead. \u201cBut the big question is, he will go [to Brussels] with what plan?\u201d asked Anna Diamantopoulos a former EU commissioner. \u201cNobody knows what plan he has.\u201d My colleague Helena Smith watched Alexis Tsipras speak, and reports: Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister greeted the result telling the nation in a televised address that that the Greek people had made a very \u201cbold choice\u201d. \u201cGreek people today gave an answer to [the question of] what Europe we want? And what we want is a Europe of solidarity,\u201d he said adding that he would relaunch negotiations with creditors immediately. \u201cI want to thank each and every one of you .... I want also to thank the thousands of European citizens who have shown practicably what solidarity means.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to the thousands who have demonstrated in support of Greece abroad. Tsipras added: \u201cWe all know that easy solutions don\u2019t exist but just solutions exist\u201d \u201cToday we are celebrating the victory of democracy, tomorrow the hard work begins,\u201d he said, revealing that he would ask the president of the republic to convene a meeting of the country\u2019s entire political leadership so that he could hear their views about how best to negotiate the country\u2019s way of the crisis. And here\u2019s some instant reaction: Negotiations between Athens and its creditors will start tomorrow, insists a serious-looking Tsipras. We are ready to continue negotiating with a reform plan, and the goal of restoring our banking system to normality quickly. Tsipras also declared that Greece will insist on debt restructuring being on the table at those talks. I have asked the Greek president to convene the party leaders meeting tomorrow for a briefing, but also hear their views, he adds. Today\u2019s vote does not mean Greece is heading out of the eurozone, says Tsipras. The Greek people did not answer a question on Europe, he insists - we must take that question \u2018off the table completely\u2019. (last week, several European leaders warned that a No vote would mean Greece was voting to leave the eurozone, although there has been some rowing back since) Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is addressing the nation now. Today, he says, Greece has proved that democracy cannot be blackmailed; Greeks have made a brave choice, and one which will change the debate in Europe. I understand that voters have not given me a mandate against Europe, but a mandate for a sustainable solution. And he warns that there are no easy solutions -- but a fair solution can be found, if both sides want it. Slovakia\u2019s finance minister has warned that Grexit is now a realistic scenario. Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande have spoken on the phone tonight, and agreed that a eurozone leaders\u2019 summit should be held on Tuesday. That\u2019s according to the German government spokesman, who said the chancellor and president also agreed that the referendum result should be respected (via Reuters) A quick recap: Greece has delivered a dramatic, unexpected and sensational rejection of the terms demanded by its creditors in return for aid, putting itself closer to leaving the euro. With more than three quarters of votes counted, around 62% of Greeks have voted No, or Oxi \u2013 stunning the eurozone, and opening up another chapter in this long crisis. Thousands of No supporters have hit the streets of Athens tonight to celebrate: Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has praised Greeks for the \u2018brave decision\u2019 to reject the bailout package proposed by lenders, calling it a \u201cbig yes for democratic Europe\u2019. And labour minister Panos Skourletis has said Greece now has a very strong card to use to negotiate a better deal. But the news has already been badly received in Germany. Vice-chancellor and social democratic leader, Sigmar Gabriel has warned it is hard to see how Greece can now negotiate a third bailout. German chancellor Angela Merkel is to meet with French president Francois Hollande tonight to discuss the situation. Antonis Samaras, the head of the New Democracy party who campaigned for a Yes vote, has fallen on his sword. But beyond the euphoria, Greece still faces a desperately difficult situation after a week of capital controls, which left its banks closed and running very short of cash. The Greek government is expected to meet tonight with its central bank, and the main commercial banks, to discuss the liquidity situation. The Bank of Greece is expected to ask the European Central Bank for more liquidity; analysts have already predicted this request will be rejected. One economist has predicted that there is a 75% chance that Greece will now leave the eurozone. Europe\u2019s financial markets are expected to fall sharply on Monday, with the FTSE 100 tipped to fall by around 2%. The euro has already fallen by 1% in early trading. It appears that the No campaign have crossed the line, and cannot now be caught. Antonis Samaras, the head of the opposition right-wing New Democracy party, has just resigned - bringing more cheer to the No campaigners. As Helena Smith reported earlier, Samaras was facing calls to resign once the scale of the Yes campaign\u2019s failure became clear. The vote counters are heading into the final stretch: European stock markets and the euro are both expected to suffer substantial falls following today\u2019s referendum: Over in Berlin, politicians are watching events unfold in Athens and wondering where the eurozone goes next. German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel told the Tagesspiegel newspaper that this no vote makes it hard to imagine talks on a new bailout programme with Greece. And he accused Alexis Tsipras of having \u201ctorn down the last bridges\u201d which could have led to a compromise: I\u2019ve taken the quotes from Reuters: \u201cWith the rejection of the rules of the euro zone ...negotiations about a programme worth billions are barely conceivable,.... Tsipras and his government are leading the Greek people on a path of bitter abandonment and hopelessness.\u201d Two thirds of the ballot papers have now been counted, and the No campaign is still holding firm with over 61% of votes. Reminder, you can track the count here. On the other side of the world, the financial markets are waking up to the news from Greece. The euro has promptly tumbled by 1%, falling from $1.111 to $1.099 against the US dollar. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has just giving a statement to the media in Athens. He says that the Greek people have given a clear message - no to more cuts, yes to real reforms. Starting tomorrow, we will call on partners to find common ground, Varoufakis says, adding: Today\u2019s no is a big yes to a democratic Europe, and it strengthens the protection that Greece offers its people. (that\u2019s via the BBC\u2019s translator) More and more people are pouring into Syntagma Square to celebrate. Greece\u2019s future in the eurozone hangs by a \u2018gossamer thread\u2019 tonight, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott. The ECB could snip that thread tomorrow, by cutting emergency liquidity. But Greece\u2019s lenders are more likely to play a long game... Here\u2019s a flavour of Larry\u2019s analysis: The temptation for the creditors could be to let the Greeks sweat a bit, to see if a couple of weeks of a cashless economy can do what the referendum could not: effect regime change. Tsipras would be under pressure to resign and call fresh elections if the economic news worsens, and that might result in the election of a government more amenable to the rest of Europe. But playing it long is risky. Greece might be forced out of the euro before Tsipras gets round to resigning, so desperate is its economic plight. What the creditors should do is to respect the result of the referendum, realise that they have to give Greece something in order to prevent the crisis escalating out of control, and recognise that debt relief must be an explicit part of a funding package that will see the eurozone\u2019s weakest member through the next couple of years. Put simply, they should try a bit less stick and a bit more carrot.... The No celebrations are getting underway in earnest in Athens: Greek television are reporting that Alexis Tsipras has spoken with several European leaders, starting with the French president Francois Hollande. There are also suggestions that ECB president Mario Draghi has also been contacted. Chants are ringing out across Syntagma Square as No campaigners celebrate their success. There is optimism that Greece can now, finally, achieve a decisive breakthrough with its creditors, reports Matina Stevis of the Wall Street Journal. This is the second time in five months that Alexis Tsipras has secured a stunning victory at the ballot box, on the promise of a better future and a break from the past. Despite the struggles since January, his supporters believe he can achieve it. The referendum results have also been hailed by the opposite end of the political spectrum; France\u2019s anti-immigrant, eurosceptic National Front. Their leader, Marine Le Pen, says: \u201cThis \u2018No\u2019 from the Greek people must pave the way for a healthy new approach,\u201d \u201cEuropean countries should take advantage of this event together around the negotiating table, take stock of the failure of the euro and austerity, and organise the dissolution of the single currency system, which is needed to get back to real growth, employment and debt reduction.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the quotes) The Green party has hailed tonight\u2019s referendum as a decisive vote against austerity: Caroline Lucas MP, who represents the British south coast constituency of Brighton Pavilion, says the eurozone must now accept that Greece needs debt relief: \u201cThe Greek people have made a decision which must now be respected. This referendum has seen EU states do their very best to undermine the democratic will of the Greek people but it\u2019s time to draw a line under the past and move onwards. \u201cHistory shows us that countries can escape crippling debt in a just way. In 1953, at London Conference, Greece was among the European nations signing a deal which allowed for the cancellation of German debt, to enable the country to grow again after the destruction of the Second World War. Europe needs to come together to offer the Greeks a deal which allows their country to be rebuilt.\u201d One important element of tonight\u2019s voting is that young people have voted in their droves in favour of no, by around 2 to 1. Greece\u2019s youth have suffered particularly badly from the last five years, with youth unemployment at record levels. But a majority of older voters backed the yes side, with their savings and pensions on the line. Half the ballot papers have now been counted, and no is still holding firm with 61% of votes. The heads of Germany\u2019s savings bank association has told Reuters that Greece should now leave the eurozone. And the head of the German exporters association told Reuters he can\u2019t see how Greece stays in the single currency now. Greece\u2019s labour minister, Panos Skourletis, has reacted to the results, and hailed the outcome as a very good thing for democracy. \u201cThe goverment can go now with a very strong card to continue negotiations [with creditors],\u201d he told reporters outside the prime minister\u2019s office. Greece\u2019s veteran commentator Pavlos Tzimas has just told SKAI TV that it is vital that an agreement is reached by 20 July, when Greece must meet a \u20ac3bn debt repayment to the European Central Bank. But it is practically impossible to have an agreement in less than two weeks as [whatever is agreed] would need to be ratified by parliaments. Kathleen Brooks, of Forex.com, also fears for Greece\u2019s banking sector. She writes: A win for the no camp also makes negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors substantially harder, and thus, it cannot be assumed that Greece will get any more money from the EU, ECB or IMF. \u00b7 This makes further defaults, including on some large sums owed to the ECB later this month, even more likely. \u00b7 Overall, those who thought the chances of Grexit were at 60% last week must now be revising them up to 80%. Brooks believes that the ECB could take the decision to cut emergency liquidity support this week, meaning the Greek financial system \u201ccould collapse in a matter of days\u201d. Without a functioning banking system, and with no decent alternative coming from the Syriza government, we expect Greece to fall into a deep recession for many years. Financial analysts are starting to react to the Greek referendum results. Wolf Piccoli, of Teneo Intelligence, reckons that there is now a 75% chance that Greece will eventually leave the eurozone. He believes the European Central Bank will not raise the cap on emergency liquidity, even though Greek banks are desperately short of cash. This will further raise doubts over whether all of Greece\u2019s big commercial banks will be able to survive the coming week; their remaining liquidity buffers are likely to last until Tuesday, at best. Within the ECB, there may even be a push to consider a further increase in the haircut on the collateral accepted in return for ELA access, although Monday may be too early for such a move given that the further course of negotiations is still unclear. Piccoli also predicts that Greece\u2019s creditors will maintain a hard line: Once Athens and its lenders resume talks, Tsipras is likely to point to the IMF\u2019s recent debt sustainability analysis [which has effectively once more made the case for debt relief] and tonight\u2019s no vote. But calls to respect the democratic will of the Greek people and offer a better deal will likely be answered by reference to the \u2013 in substance very different \u2013 democratic will in creditor countries. Instead, the lenders will likely argue that given the by now worsened economic situation, further efforts will be required to get the country back on track. This may translate into further cuts and/or additional revenue-raising measures to meet primary surplus targets. And there is even the possibility that Greece\u2019s president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, resigns to trigger early elections in an attempt to prevent Greece sliding out of the eurozone. Eurozone finance ministers are not planning on an emergency meeting tomorrow. One official has told Reuters: No way. [The ministers] would not know what to discuss. Supporters of the no campaign are starting to celebrate in Athens, with almost 40% of votes counted: No camp supporters are also gathering in Syntagma Square, site of the Greek parliament. More than 35% of the ballot papers have now been counted, and no is still firmly ahead with 61% of the votes. The landslide is still on course. Heads may soon be rolling in the opposition camp. Demands are growing for Antonis Samaras, the main opposition leader and former prime minister to step down as head of the centre-right New Democracy party following the apparent victory of the no vote, reports Helena Smith. The former finance minister Dora Bakoyannis has called Samaras demanding that he step down with immediate effect, several media outlets are reporting. There are signs that some traditional New Democracy party supporters deliberately voted no (when the party had urged Greeks to vote yes) out of protest against Samaras, who has refused to resign. Greece\u2019s interior ministry has released an official projection, showing that the no side is set to win by 61%. That is a landslide result for the government, which had urged people to reject the bailout proposals made by lenders. Investors simply didn\u2019t expect such a decisive win by the no side, so there could be dramatic moves in tomorrow\u2019s financial markets. Government bond trader Gus Baratta predicts a lively start to trading: In Athens, one of Greece\u2019s negotiators, Euclid Tsakalotos, is predicting that the government will be able to reach an agreement with creditors very quickly. Helena Smith is hearing that a mini-cabinet meeting may well be held later tonight \u2013 amid talk that a new negotiating team may be assembled by the leftist-led government. Asked why he believed the government could cut a deal with creditors so soon \u2013 when for the past five months talks have been deadlocked \u2013 Tsakalotos told STAR TV: The first thing is that the IMF report [released last week] proves that the debt [load] is not viable and secondly that there is a new popular mandate as it would seem from the apparent result of the referendum. The London stock market is expected to fall sharply tomorrow morning, as investors brace for further turbulence in the eurozone. Twenty percent of the votes have now been counted, and the no side is holding on to a solid lead \u2013 with more than 60%, against less than 40% for the yes side. Greece is on track to give a \u201cBig No\u201d: Our live results service shows that about 60% of the early votes counted have gone to the no side (ie, to reject the terms from Greece\u2019s creditors): You can track it all here: Live results: Greek referendum Breaking: almost 10% of votes have been counted so far, and no has a solid lead. Nikos Voutsis, Greece\u2019s interior minister and a close ally of Alexis Tsipras, has just spoken to the media. He says that participation rate is over 50%, meaning the referendum is legally valid (the threshold is 40%). Feedback from the public shows that the public are satisfied with the way the referendum was held. And Voutsis says that we should get a good official indication of the result by 9pm local time, or 7pm BST. Not long to wait.... Reuters is reporting that the Bank of Greece will ask the European Central Bank for more emergency liquidity assistance for its banks. Across Greece, people are settling down to await tonight\u2019s results. Our Southern Europe editor John Hooper has secured a plum spot in a cafe near the Athens parliament, and is tweeting away: In Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s northern second city, as the referendum neared its close, voters were still steadily streaming into a primary school polling station in the centre, reports Angelique Chrisafis. The mood was calm. Any cashpoint queues in the surrounding streets were no longer than three or four people. Some voters said their minds had been made up from the start, but others said they had struggled to decide how to vote and had felt the pressure of bank closures, capital controls and media campaigns about doomsday scenarios. Some said the bank controls had made them lean towards a yes vote to try to restore some kind of normality, others said bank controls had tipped them to vote no to express their anger. Penny Chorafa, 38, runs an architectural practice with her husband and has seen business plummet during the five years of the Greek debt crisis as construction projects stalled. She had made her mind up to vote no from the start. She said she absolutely wanted Greece to stay in Europe and the eurozone and to her, these were not the core issues of the vote. Instead, she believed voting no was about protesting against austerity and refusing a bad deal from Greece\u2019s creditors. I voted no to make a statement to the powers-that-be that citizens\u2019 lives have to be taken into account. It\u2019s time for all the European countries to do something about these economic lobbies that dominate. Chorafa said if the yes vote won, she would be so disappointed she would think about leaving Greece with her two small children and moving abroad. Antonis Vakalis, 45, who runs two private schools in the city, voted yes. He thought the referendum question was muddled, ridiculous and now out of date: But I voted yes to say I\u2019m for the euro and for the unity of European countries. He said his vote didn\u2019t mean that he was in favour of austerity. But amid all the confusion surrounding what the question and the referendum itself meant, he felt it was crucial to register his stance in favour of \u201cGreece\u2019s rightful place inside the European Union\u201d. First official polls are expected to be released by Greece\u2019s ministry of interior at 9.30pm time (7.30pm BST), Helena Smith reports. \u201cWhat we are seeing now are indications,\u201d she adds. And here\u2019s a reminder of the four opinion polls (not exit polls!) released by the Greek TV stations as the polls shut: Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis has warned that Athens needs to reach a deal fast: Without a deal, it\u2019s hard to see how the European Central Bank can pump more liquidity into the Greek banking sector to allow them to reopen.... Greece\u2019s finance minister has criticised the media over the way his comments to CNBC today have been reported: Getting a deal in 24 hours is going to be tricky, I\u2019d suggest, as the leaders of France and Germany are holding their own meeting in Paris tomorrow night.... The French government has confirmed that Angela Merkel will visit Paris tomorrow night to discuss the Greek referendum: Alexis Tsipras has arrived back at his residence in Athens, according to the Kathimerini newspaper: European leaders are scrambling to keep up with the latest drama in Greece. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, will travel to Paris on Monday afternoon to discuss the result of the Greek referendum with the French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a German government spokesman said on Sunday. Merkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said: The talks with the French president from 6.30pm, and over dinner, will be about a common assessment of the situation after the Greek referendum and the continuation of the close German-French cooperation on this subject. (via AFP) That\u2019s 5.30pm BST, or 7.30pm in Greece. Sources in Syriza are saying that top government officials, including state minister and chief negotiator Nikos Pappas, the Greek prime minister\u2019s closest political ally, have \u201cpacked their bags and are ready to return to Brussels\u201d to relaunch negotiations, Helena Smith reports. Helena has been hearing that ever more ATMs have run out of cash with banks unable to replenish them. One source said: The situation with banks is critical and must be addressed ASAP. These opinion polls give the governing radical left Syriza party cause for \u201crestrained optimism\u201d that OXI (no) is going to triumph if only marginally, says our correspondent Helena Smith in Athens. But, at the risk of banging on, we need to wait for official news from tonight\u2019s counts before we know for sure. Here\u2019s what government spokesman Nikos Filis told Greek television as the opinion polls were released: I think this is guidance for the government\u2026 to move forward quickly to seek a deal and normalise the banking system. (via Reuters) A spokesman for the Syriza party has told Reuters that these opinion polls suggest the government can now \u201cmove forward quickly\u201d and seal a deal with its creditors (as Yanis Varoufakis predicted earlier today). These opinion polls also show that Greece has been split almost down the middle by this referendum, points out journalist Nick Malkoutzis: And here\u2019s another of the opinion polls suggesting that Greece has voted no today. But please do remember that ballot papers are only now being counted -- we may have to wait a couple of hours for a firm indication. All six major Greek TV stations are predicting a victory for the No campaign, says Sky News. A flurry of opinion polls conducted by Greek TV stations are hitting the wires, and they are all putting the no side ahead of the Yes side: We need to be cautious - these are not full exit polls. But it\u2019s important to note that they are ALL suggesting that the people have voted to reject the bailout conditions demanded by Greece\u2019s creditors: We\u2019ll be tracking all tonight\u2019s results from Greece in this interactive: TAKE YOUR SEATS FOR DRAMA. Polling booths across Greece have just closed, as a referendum that could determine the country\u2019s place in the eurozone comes to an end. Local media report that voting was brisk, similar to January\u2019s turnout, as voters had their say in a contest that has electrified Greece, and beyond. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has told CNBC that Greece could reach a deal with its creditors within 24 hours, if Greeks vote No today. Straw polling has suggested that the No side may be ahead, but the full result may not be known for many hours. The mayor of Thessaloniki, Yannis Boutaris, has called for Greek politicians to unite and go to Brussels to sign an agreement that will keep the debt-stricken country afloat next week. He told reporters: \u201cThere is an atmosphere in the country of seriousness and atonement. Irrespective of the result, politicians must all go together to Brussels to make an agreement. It will be difficult but that is what has to happen.\u201d City traders and analysts are heading to their desks to watch the results unfold. Many expect a long night as the world\u2019s financial markets react to the drama. Swiss media are reporting that Greece is pushing on with an amnesty for undeclared assets, to boost revenue. And Germany\u2019s Spiegel newspaper has warned that Angela Merkel\u2019s chancellorship is also on the line..... We\u2019re about to hear a lot of noise from Greece, as phone polls conducted today are released. Important note - these are not full exit polls, according to local media. Anyone planning to vote fashionably late should consider leaving the house right now Our correspondent Helena Smith has learned that sources close to the EU commission in Brussels are estimating that the NO vote could be ahead by 8 -10 points. But Helena says we really don\u2019t know how reliable the figure is as we don\u2019t know what methodology was used to come up with this figure. She adds: Based, however, on anecdotal evidence a lot of middle class Greeks, who I spoke to today - and who would normally be firmly European and totally committed to their country\u2019s continued role in the heart of Europe - conveyed how they had simply given up hope. Younger middle class Greeks, with young children, said they were voting \u2018no\u2019 in the hope that at least that way their kids would have some kind of future. None of them seem to have been swayed by the fear factor: that of they voted \u2018no\u2019 the country would be kicked out of the euro. CNBC has now published its interview with Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis. When asked how confident he was ahead of the result, he said: I don\u2019t need to be confident, this is a beautiful democracy. We only have to wait a few hours for the verdict to come through. He was then asked how swiftly the Greek government could a deal with lenders, in the event of a \u201cno\u201d result: 24 hours. As we flagged earlier, finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has claimed that in the event of a NO vote, a deal can be reached with creditors \u201cwithin 24 hours.\u201d Is there something in this, our correspondent Helena Smith wonders? I have just conducted a two-hour straw poll asking 12 people, across all age groups, if they had voted today and, if so, which way they had gone? A lot were returning from polls stations in the vicinity of central Athens. Of the 12 , ten said they had voted OXI (No). The two who voted yes owned shops in the district of Plaka beneath the ancient Acropolis. If the government (as I expect is the case) has also been conducting secret exit polls, it might explain Varoufakis\u2019 remarks. Only one choice was being recommended at this polling station in Chalkida, Evia today, reports Daniel Howden. The Greek depression has hit the cement works and shipyards hard here, lending strong support to the ruling radical left coalition, Syriza. In the island of Evia, a popular retreat from the heat of Athens, there appears to be strong support for the No vote. Sporting a \u201cNo for dignity\u201d badge, Athina Vlahogiorgou says that those calling for yes vote were \u201cspitting in the face of the Greek people.\u201d A single parent with two children, she is among the large cadre of the long term unemployed. \u201cAfter the last five years, whoever wants to ignore what\u2019s been done to us has something wrong in their head.\u201d \u201cThis is not about the Drachma or the Euro. This is a class issue.\u201d Her son, who has just turned 21, has left for London where he works in the kitchen of a fast food restaurant. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t even find a job like that here. What do I have left to lose?\u201d We\u2019re in to the final hour of voting.... Following Angela Merkel\u2019s statement to the Bundestag last week that a third Greek debt relief package was likely but could only be hammered out after the referendum, Anja Maier writes an interesting analysis of the German chancellor\u2019s position in the left-wing Berlin newspaper TAZ. \u201cIs Merkel invulnerable?\u201d she asks, arguing: \u201cAt the moment, in the role of the unhysterical albeit worried leader, she appears to be undamaged by the crisis. You can sense that she is quite content with the idea of refusing to hold any more talks with Athens. Even in these hardcore days it is said that she is sleeping well at night. During the most critical moments of the Ukraine crisis she appeared to be much more worn out than she does now.\u201d To answer further the question as to how much the Greek crisis might have damaged Merkel, Maier turns to Lutz Meyer, the PR man who managed Merkel\u2019s 2013 election campaign. Why, he asks, should Merkel come out of this badly? In his view: \u201cThe Euro will remain, Europe will not collapse, and Germany will retain its reputation as the country that advocates tight household budgetary control.\u201d Neither can Merkel be blamed as the German politician who made the rather controversial decision to let Greece into the Eurozone in the first place. Maybe Greece should never have been allowed in, Meyer remarks: \u201cBut it was the government of (Gerhard) Schr\u00f6der who decided on that, not Frau Merkel.\u201d Whatever happens today, Greece faces plenty of political drama in the weeks ahead. Analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland have outlined the main consequences of today\u2019s vote: (ELA = emergency funding to Greek banks, which is currently capped at \u20ac89bn). According to respected Swiss paper, Neue Z\u00fcrcher am Sonntag Zeitung, Greece is planning a tax amnesty for all Greeks who own Swiss bank accounts. The country, writes the paper, is so desperate for money to fill its coffers that it has appealed to tax evaders to come forward and they will escape prosecution if they pay 21% on their undeclared income. The paper refers to \u201cwell informed circles\u201d. Estimates as to how much untaxed Greek money is lying in Swiss bank accounts vary widely, ranging says the NZZ, from between \u20ac2bn to \u20ac200bn. The amnesty could therefore prove to be a good move - if tax evaders react to the offer. Back in April, Yanis Varoufakis pledged to introduce legislation to encourage Greeks to reveal undeclared assets in Switzerland. Sky News\u2019s economics editor, Ed Conway, has treked to the Athens suburb of Holargos where Greece\u2019s central bank owns a printing press: That\u2019s where the drachma was printed, before Greece joined the euro, and in theory it could produce notes again. Although, as explained on Bloomberg, creating a new currency usually takes months. The events in Greece are dominating the thoughts of many bankers this weekend. Barclays has a team of foreign exchange experts arriving at 5pm. Its research, sales and trading staff have been monitoring the Greek referendum all weekend. The main Asian markets will all be trading by 2.30am London time so traders will getting ready to put through trades for clients. Analysts will need to be ready to give advice to clients on the implications of the referendum. More photos from Greece today, via our GuardianWitness assignment: The BBC\u2019s Robert Peston reports that the Greek government will hold talks with its central bank, and the country\u2019s major commercial banks, tonight to discuss the situation. Sky News\u2019s Emily Purser reports that the \u20ac60 per day cap on ATM withdrawals is now effectively down to \u20ac50, because \u20ac20 notes are in such short supply. The European Central Bank is due to meet on Monday to discuss Greece, a week after capping the emergency funding it provides to its banks (which is now clearly running out). There are just two hours to go until the polls close across Greece. We may then get polling data, indicating how Greeks have voted on this momentous day. However, it appears these will be \u2018phone polls\u2019, asking people how they voted - rather than surveys taken outside the polling stations. So we may have to wait a couple of hours until actual data come in. And if it\u2019s a tight race, the result won\u2019t come until after midnight in Greece (and probably the UK too) The Bild tabloid is reporting on how Europe\u2019s bankers are hunkering down for a long night. Deutsche Bank, for one, is planning a telephone conference for its top bankers at 10pm local time, in order to advise on the results of the referendum and what a \u2018yes\u2019 or a \u2018no\u2019 will mean for international creditors. Other big banks are reportedly taking similar action. G\u00e9rard Araud, France\u2019s ambassador to the United States, has tweeted that Paris will do everything it can to avoid Grexit: Germany\u2019s defence minister Ursula von der Leyen has delivered a swift rebuke to Yanis Varoufakis\u2019s claim yesterday that the Greeks had been terrorised by their creditors. She told the Passauer Neuen Presse: \u201cThe remark by Varoufakis is a mockery to everyone that suffers from (the effects) of terrorism.\u201d The mayor of Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s second city, believes that Alexis Tsipras and the leaders of the other main political parties should \u201chead to Brussels together\u201d on Monday - regardless of whether Greece votes Yes or No. Yiannis Boutaris, who was shortlisted for World Mayor 2014, said in a statement: \u201cWhatever the result of the referendum, the prime minister and the politicalleaders must understand that they must get together and go to Brussels to give asign of credibility,\u201d Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, continues to insist that Athens can reach an agreement with its lenders quickly, if the country votes no today. As well as ticking that ballot paper, Greeks have been able to express their preferences at the local cake shop: The No campaign have been using images of Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and his Dutch counterpart Jeroen Dijsselbloem, to encourage people to tick the OXI box. (Dijsselbloem has chaired the eurogroup meetings where Greece battled with its creditors so often, and with little success, this year) Germany\u2019s Spiegel newspaper has the inside line of how Angela Merkel reacted last weekend to the news that Alexis Tsipras had called today\u2019s referendum, It says an exasperated Merkel told the inner circle of her CDU party that his politics were \u201chard and ideological\u201d and that he was \u201cdriving his country to the wall, with open eyes\u201d. Spiegel says that the quotes have been confirmed by several participants of the meeting at the Konrad Adenauer House in Berlin, last Monday. It added she was flabbergasted that he could \u201cplay roulette with an entire country\u201d. Spiegel\u2019s front page cover has Merkel sitting on the rubble of a collapsed Greece, with the headline \u201cDie Trummerfrau\u201d - a reference to the \u2018rubble ladies\u2019 who cleared up bombed-out Berlin after the war, and the declaration: \u201cIf the Euro collapses, so too will Merkel\u2019s chancellorship\u201d. Remember, you can share your experiences of today\u2019s referendum through GuardianWitness, as this reader already has: Greek are continuing to vote in steady numbers; the Mega TV channel says turnout has already hit 35%, so safely on track to clear the 40% threshold to be legally valid. And the Athens News Agency says ballot boxes are being filled at a similar rate to January\u2019s general election, when 65% of the population voted. Here\u2019s some of the latest photos from this momentous day: 10 million Greeks are going to the polls to vote on a bailout package in a referendum that could decide whether Greece stays in the euro. Polls are due to close at 7pm Athens time (5pm London time) and the first exit poll is expected shortly after, but it could take until the early hours of Monday before the result is known. Opinion polls suggest the country is split down the middle. Analysts say the youth vote is crucial. After casting his vote, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras said: \u2018Today democracy conquers fear\u2019. He has been urging Greeks to vote \u2018Ochi\u2019 (\u2018No\u2019) The European Central Bank has signalled it stands ready to take additional measures if necessary. UK chancellor George Osborne has warned that Britain is not immune from European turmoil, but insisted that the government is prepared for whatever the outcome is. David Cameron will meet the Bank of England governor on Monday. In a stark warning, the head of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, said Greece will have to introduce another currency if the \u2018No\u2019 vote prevails. But he held out an olive branch, saying the EU would advance further emergency loans to keep vital public services running in Greece. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann has warned the German government that a Grexit would rip a big hole in Germany\u2019s finances, according to a report Greek voting stations close at 5pm BST with the first exit poll expected shortly after. If the knife-edge vote indicated by the most recent opinion polls hold true, it will be the early hours of Monday before the actual result is known. Four things the Greek referendum will not change \u2013 economists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: First, in Greece - Yes or No - it will take time to gain clarity on the situation. Second, much political damage has already been done in the euro area; and more could be done. Third (and perhaps first in order of importance), the euro area needs urgently to accelerate structural reform; both the national and European level. While our baseline scenario is that contagion from Greece will remain modest thanks to better tools, there is a negative risk scenario that could influence policy decisions further afield and notably slow Fed rate hikes. On our list of points that the referendum will not change, however, is (fourth) the efforts by Chinese authorities to stem the decline in its equity markets. New measures announced by the Chinese authorities (IPO suspension and a new stabilisation fund) will be put to the test next week, whatever the Greeks vote. The BBC is working hard to provide us with coverage on Greece: Much ado here over other remarks the European parliament\u2019s president Martin Schulz has also made today, says Helena Smith in Athens. Martin\u2019s Schulz\u2019s prediction that Greece will be forced to mint a new currency in the event of a \u2018no\u2019 vote has been causing waves. Several leading commentators have denounced it as shameful intervention in today\u2019s democratic process. \u201cDeplorable\u201d wrote Nikos Hatzinikolaou whose (usual) tact has helped make him Greece\u2019s most famous journalist. The leading Greek daily Ta Nea reports today that the European parliament president made the comments last Thursday but \u201cdespite that they were made public on Sunday.\u201d Daniel Howden reports from central Greece again. 40 year old mother of two, Aristea, sitting on the step of the Devernohoria village school waiting for the lunch break to end at the poll station, admits that she hasn\u2019t decided how she will vote. \u201cThis referendum should never have happened. As Greeks we\u2019ve reached the point where we need to get serious.\u201d She\u2019s worried for her job in a company that exports first aid equipment. But she\u2019s more concerned that her children will grow up in a country outside the EU. \u201cOur politicians are the worst of us. We don\u2019t have leaders.\u201d \u201cThis is our fault as Greeks and the Europeans fault as well. Everyone is to blame. We should never have got here.\u201d She said that she would vote regardless of her reservations: \u201cI have always voted. If you don\u2019t vote you\u2019re leaving it to someone else to decide.\u201d Some people suggest the initial turnout for the referendum is low, despite all the media hype. At least half a million Greeks are unable to cast their vote because they live abroad, unless they have travelled back to their home country (the place where they are registered to vote). A young Guardian reader voting for the first time says on GuardianWitness: I\u2019m 18, a first-time voter. Our voting station was quiet, but friends are texting me that in some other neighborhoods organised groups of Syriza youths are booing politicians and harassing voters. This is sad, in my circle of friends we are split in half, like the rest of Greece, but decided when it all started that we won\u2019t let it affect our friendships. Voting is such a scary thing! You have to face the fact that your decision can have a negative impact on your country.\u201d Here are six questions (and answers) about what happens next, after the dust from the referendum settles. What happens in the event of a yes, no or \u2018light no\u2019 vote? asks Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens. Former LibDem parliamentary candidate George Cunningham is in Greece. Interesting series of tweets from Greek polling stations. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann has warned that the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble faces a big hole, of several billion euros, in his budget planning if Greece leaves the euro. He issued the stark warning to the German government in a cabinet session last Wednesday, German newspaper Handelsblatt reports, citing a government source. The Bundesbank has made provisions of \u20ac14.4bn to deal with the fallout of the eurozone crisis, but this would probably not be be enough in a case of a Grexit, the paper said. Weidmann warned that the costs of a Grexit would hit Bundesbank profits, which flow into the German budget. Sch\u00e4uble has factored in a Bundesbank profit of \u20ac2.5bn a year. The European Central Bank holds \u20ac20bn of Greek securities, and the Bundesbank\u2019s share of the ECB\u2019s profits or losses made on them is about a quarter. But the costs of a Grexit would be much larger, as the ECB would have to make other write-offs. Daniel Howden has spoken to a \u2018Yes\u2019 voter. Yannis Raptodimos, 29, who lives in Dervenohoria, central Greece, and works in a local munitions factory, warns of catastrophe if the drachma is reintroduced. Those who have money in the bank will vote Yes. Those with loans have been told that if they vote No they won\u2019t have to repay them. This is not right. If you don\u2019t repay loans the banks will fold. With the Drachma we\u2019ll have catastrophe. Here are some more voices from Greece. European parliament president Martin Schulz has held out the prospect of more emergency loans from the EU to Greece to pay wages to civil servants and keep public services like transport, energy and the healthcare system running. In an interview with Germany\u2019s conservative newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag, he defended the EU\u2019s hardline approach against Athens, and expressed his hope that Greece would vote \u2018Yes\u2019 in Sunday\u2019s referendum. But he held out an olive branch, saying: We won\u2019t abandon the Greek people to their fate. John Hooper, the Guardian\u2019s southern Europe editor, writes: First came Donald Tusk, the representative of the EU\u2019s member governments, who said that a \u2018No\u2019 vote was \u201cnot ... about beingin the euro zone or not\u201d. Then we had Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble telling the Greeks that the outcome of the referendum would merely decide whether their country kept the euro or would be \u201ctemporarily without it\u201d. And now, today, we get a member of the ECB\u2019s executive board, Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 appearing to say that, no matter which way the vote goes, \u201cWe will find the necessary instruments\u201d. Odd. No? All three gentlemen must surely understand that these remarks favour a \u2018No\u2019 vote. A lot of people those of us in the Guardian team here have spoken to in recent days have been in an agony of indecision: dare they vote for rejection of the terms if, as the \u2018Yes\u2019 camp has argued, it will in effect mean voting for Grexit? These comments will comfort and encourage them to put a cross by the OXI (Ochi). Is this about regime change? Are Greece\u2019s creditors trying to engineer the downfall of their tormentor, Alexis Tsipras? It seems unlikely: a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote would surely see him out of office much more swiftly. Or are they trying instead to create the conditions for Grexit? And reassure the Greeks that they will make it as painless as they possibly can? Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, warned that Greece and its international creditors must work on a compromise to get the country out of its debt crisis, and not count only on support from the European Central Bank. Speaking at an economics conference in Aix-en-Provence in southern France, where ECB policymaker Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 vowed that the ECB would take more action if necessary, Macron said: Whatever the vote, we must start tomorrow to respond with political discussions to create a framework. It\u2019s not about taking refuge behind the ECB and others that have already done more than enough. Yanis Varoufakis, Greece\u2019s flamboyant finance minister, has confirmed that he will resign if the referendum results in a \u2018Yes\u2019 vote. But he also told Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper that there won\u2019t be a majority for a \u2018Yes\u2019 . Bild\u2019s lead story on Sunday: \u201cGreece is divided \u2013 it\u2019s painful\u201d. Greek journalist Liana Spyropoulou writes in the newspaper that the referendum has split families and friends. Commentators have warned that the vote is a \u201ccomplicated mess\u201d. Mike Bird writes on Business Insider: [The vote] asks Greeks to give a single vote on two official bailout deal documents that few will have read, and even fewer will have understood. It\u2019s not even clear that the deal being voted on is still on offer. Polls have been split pretty much straight down the middle. Nobody is sure who will win today. The opposition to the bailout deal, including the government, argue that a \u201cNo\u201d vote against the document will empower them in negotiations. Those in favour of the deal say the referendum is really a choice between the euro and Greece leaving the eurozone (a so-called Grexit). 10 million Greeks are going to the polls to vote on a cash-for-reforms deal with the country\u2019s creditors in Sunday\u2019s referendum. Polls are due to close at 7pm Athens time (5pm London time). Opinion polls suggest the country is split down the middle. Analysts say the youth vote is crucial. After casting his vote, Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras said: \u2018Today democracy conquers fear\u2019. He has been urging Greeks to vote \u2018Ochi\u2019 (\u2018No\u2019) The European Central Bank stands ready to take additional measures if necessary, said ECB policymaker Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 UK chancellor George Osborne has warned that Britain is not immune from European turmoil, but insisted that the government is prepared for whatever the outcome is. David Cameron will meet the Bank of England governor on Monday. In a stark warning, the head of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, said Greece will have to introduce another currency if the \u2018No\u2019 vote prevails. Postcards from the edge in Athens where toll roads have been declared free. Toll booth operators in cheerful blue polo shirts sit staring into the distance with nothing to do, waving the traffic through, reports Daniel Howden. Currency traders at several big investment banks are at their desks on Sunday, preparing for strong client demand following the Greek referendum, the Financial Times reports \u2013 \u00a3. After the weekend closure, the currency markets will start trading again in Asia on Monday morning, beginning in Australia and New Zealand at 10pm London time. HSBC said it was bringing in extra staff and JPMorgan was expected to do the same. Deutsche Bank also said staff would be covering the referendum. More in from out Athens correspondent Helena Smith who has been speaking to analysts. Analysts are saying this morning the ballot could ultimately be swung by the youth vote. \u201cA lot will depend on the participation of young voters today,\u201d political commentator Aristides Hatzis told the Guardian. \u201cPolls show that a huge majority, about 80 percent, of Greek youth would vote \u2018no.\u2019 How well the \u2018no\u2019 vote does will be based on this turn-out.\u201d The youth of crisis-torn Greece have been hit like no other sector of society. Joblessness levels among the under 25 age group currently exceed 55 %. Earlier today I spoke to Kosmas who turned 18 in March. \u201cI will be voting \u2018no\u2019 because we have to say \u2018no\u2019 to the rotten system,\u201d said the teenager, fiddling a large silver earring in his left ear. \u201cI have never known anything else. There must be something better out there.\u201d Syriza has openly hinted it is basing much of its hope on the \u2018no\u2019 vote with Zoe Konstantopoulou, the president of the parliament and a prominent member of the party\u2019s far left, recently cheering on the fact that, this time, young Greeks would be given the chance to vote. In general elections in January, the conservative-led government announced that for bureaucratic reasons it was too late to enroll first-time voters on the national register. And precisely because of this, the real talk of the town this morning is that the NO vote is going to win. \u201cAt this stage everyone I have talked to believes that there will be a \u2018no\u2019 vote,\u201d added Hatzis a professor of law and economics at Athens University. \u201c I very much hope to be proven wrong.\u201d The head of the European parliament, Martin Schulz, told German radio that Greece will have to introduce another currency if the \u2018No\u2019 vote prevails. He told Germany\u2019s Deutschlandfunk in an interview broadcast on Sunday and taped on Thursday: Is Greece still in the euro after this referendum? That is certainly the case, but if they say \u2018No\u2019 they will have to introduce another currency after the referendum because the euro is not available as a means of payment. The moment someone introduces a new currency, they exit the eurozone. Those are the elements that give me some hope that people will not vote \u2018No\u2019 today. Meanwhile, Germany\u2019s hardline finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, struck a more conciliatory tone towards Athens this weekend. Having previously insisted that a No vote on the cash-for-reforms deal would see Greece forced out of the euro, he told the Bild newspaper that the choice before Greeks was between holding on to the euro and being \u201ctemporarily without it\u201d. It was unclear what Sch\u00e4uble had in mind, but economists have mooted the notion of a period in which Greece might go back to its national currency, the drachma, while its economy recovered. The head of Germany\u2019s Ifo institute, Hans-Werner Sinn, also suggested a temporary Grexit on Friday. The European Central Bank stands ready to take additional measures if necessary, ECB executive board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 said this morning. Speaking at an economics conference in Aix-en-Provence in southern France, he said, according to Reuters: In the current circumstances of great uncertainty in Europe and the world, the ECB has been clear that if we need to do more we will do more. We will find the necessary instruments. Our will to act in this matter should not be doubted. \u201cToday democracy conquers fear,\u201d said Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras after casting his vote in Greece\u2019s historic referendum. Here are his comments in full, courtesy of Reuters. He said in Athens\u2019 working class district of Kypseli, where he is registered to vote: Many people can ignore the will of a government. But no one can ignore the will of a people. Today is a day of celebration, because democracy is a celebration, it is joy. And when democracy overcomes fear and extortion, then it becomes a redemption and a way out. The Greek people today send a very strong message. A message of dignity and determination. The message that they hold a choice in their hands. No one can ignore the will of a people to live. To live with determination and take their life in their own hands. I am certain that from tomorrow we will have broken a path for all the peoples in Europe. A path of return to the founding values of democracy and solidarity in Europe, sending a strong message of determination, not only to stay but also to live with dignity in Europe. To do well and work as equals among equals. Let us therefore make this act of strong will, this celebratory act of democracy, an act of determination for a better future for all of us, both in Greece and Europe. I am very optimistic.\u201d Polling stations in Greece are open until 7pm local time (5pm BST), but there are suggestions that they could stay open later if they run short of envelopes. Polling stations in Greece opened nearly five hours ago. George Osborne, the UK chancellor, has just been asked how he would vote in the Greek referendum on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show. He refused to say how he would vote, saying: \u201cWe should respect Greek democracy,\u201d noting that the country is the \u201chome of democracy\u201d. Osborne warned that the UK is not immune from European turmoil, but added that Britain was prepared for any eventuality. David Cameron, the UK prime minister, will meet with Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, on Monday to discuss the outcome of the Greek referendum and what it means for the rest of Europe. Whatever Greece decides, Britain is prepared. We have the plans in place whatever the outcome is. I don\u2019t think anyone should be in doubt that the outcome has an impact on the European economy, which is all the more reason to keep our house in order. We all want Greece to prosper\u2026but ultimately if you\u2019re in the single currency there are rules you have to abide by. Warning that potentially explosive moments lay ahead, the head of Greece\u2019s orthodox communist party, KKE, Dimitris Koutsombas also called for unity, reports Helena Smith. \u201cThe workers\u2019 class, with unity and alliance, must face whatever development, whether these lead to a new agreement, a guillotine essentially with tough measures or whether they lead to developments outside the euro, a double currency with our people being bankrupt.\u201d The KKE has also urged supporters to reject creditors proposed reforms saying acceptance would lead to further pauperisation of Greeks. Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith reports: By 10.30am the country\u2019s entire political leadership had cast ballots. Voting in the central Athens district of Kypseli, prime minister Alexis Tsipras called the referendum a \u201cday of celebration\u201d for the crisis-hit country. Addressing a crush of reporters, amid loud cries of NO from supporters, Tsipras lashed out at the war of propaganda that had been waged in the week since he called had called the vote. \u201cDemocracy has defeated fear. The determination of the people will beat the propaganda of fear,\u201d said the radical leftist who had openly campaigned for Greeks to vote no. \u201cThe people are sending a message. A government can be ignored but no one can ignore the desire of an entire people to take life in its hands. \u201c Earlier, Greece\u2019s head of state, president Prokopis Pavlopoulos emphasised the need for national unity. The referendum, the second to take place in more than 40 years, comes amid escalating signs of ethnic division and fears of civil strife. \u201cIrrespective of the result, we have to traverse what will be a difficult tomorrow with unity,\u201d Pavlopoulos told reporters. \u201cThat is what our forefathers did. That is what we are going to do. We will go forward, all together.\u201d Some 108,371 Greeks who have just turned 18 will vote for the first time, according to authorities. Of that number 55,206 are men and 53,165 women. Greek youth, very badly hit by unemployment, are expected in the main to vote no, pollsters say. Good morning. About 10 million Greeks are going to the polls on Sunday, to vote in a referendum that poses the biggest challenge to the euro since its adoption in 1999. We will bring you the latest news and developments throughout the day. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has urged Greeks to vote \u2018Ochi\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 on whether to accept the bailout package drawn up with creditors, in the hope of securing a better deal.",

The focus is on the European Central Bank and what it will do about the \u20ac89bn of emergency liquidity assistance it has been using to keep Greek banks afloat. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cOver the next few hours, both sides\u2019 willingness to re-start negotiations and under what conditions remains the most important next step.

Today\u2019s vote will allow the PM to maintain the political initiative within Greece, re-enforcing his leadership within the party as well as the government. It will be perceived by the government as a strong backing around its tough negotiating strategy.</p> <p><strong>Second</strong>, the poll masks a deeply divided electoral body. The win to the \u201cno\u201d vote was decisive. But opinion polls over the last few days have continued to show an overwhelming support for euro membership. How this can be reconciled with the \u201cno\u201d vote and rising economic costs remains to be seen in coming days. Either way, the referendum process itself and the outcome has increased polarization in Greece.

react to the Greek referendum results.</strong></p> <p><strong>Wolf Piccoli, </strong>of Teneo Intelligence, reckons that there is now a 75% chance that Greece will eventually leave the eurozone.</p> <p>He believes the European Central Bank will not raise the cap on emergency liquidity, even though Greek banks are desperately short of cash. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This will further raise doubts over whether all of Greece\u2019s big commercial banks will be able to survive the coming week; their remaining liquidity buffers are likely to last until Tuesday, at best. Within the ECB, there may even be a push to consider a further increase in the haircut on the collateral accepted in return for ELA access, although Monday may be too early for such a move given that the further course of negotiations is still unclear.</p> </blockquote> <p>Piccoli also predicts that Greece\u2019s creditors will maintain a hard line: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once Athens and its lenders resume talks, Tsipras is likely to point to the IMF\u2019s recent debt sustainability analysis [which has effectively once more made the case for debt relief] and tonight\u2019s no vote. But calls to respect the democratic will of the Greek people and offer a better deal will likely be answered by reference to the \u2013 in substance very different \u2013 democratic will in creditor countries.</p> <p>Instead, the lenders will likely argue that given the by now worsened economic situation, further efforts will be required to get the country back on track. This may translate into further cuts and/or additional revenue-raising measures to meet primary surplus targets.</p> </blockquote> <p>And there is even the possibility that Greece\u2019s president, <strong>Prokopis Pavlopoulos</strong>, resigns to trigger early elections in an attempt to prevent Greece sliding out of the eurozone.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-05T18:49:48.015Z\">at 7.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-559976e9e4b00bdd27707ddc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-05T18:31:01.272Z\">7.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eurozone finance ministers are not planning on an emergency meeting tomorrow.</strong></p> <p>One official has told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No way.

Third (and perhaps first in order of importance), the euro area needs urgently to accelerate structural reform; both the national and European level. </p> <p>While our baseline scenario is that contagion from Greece will remain modest thanks to better tools, there is a negative risk scenario that could influence policy decisions further afield and notably slow Fed rate hikes. </p> <p>On our list of points that the referendum will not change, however, is (fourth) the efforts by Chinese authorities to stem the decline in its equity markets. New measures announced by the Chinese authorities (IPO suspension and a new stabilisation fund) will be put to the test next week, whatever the Greeks vote.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-559920e7e4b032a39a3ba839\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-05T12:20:19.341Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The BBC is working hard to provide us with coverage on Greece:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCRosAtkins/statuses/617667277987676160\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is commitment. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCTimFranks\">@BBCTimFranks</a> hosting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Newshour?src=hash\">#Newshour</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcworldservice\">@bbcworldservice</a> under not one but two umbrellas. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/greece?src=hash\">#greece</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/v44KYHOHFk\">pic.twitter.com/v44KYHOHFk</a></p>&mdash; Ros Atkins (@BBCRosAtkins) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCRosAtkins/status/617667277987676160\">July 5, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-55991fb9e4b00bdd27707d2c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helenasmith\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-05T12:16:49.199Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Much ado here over other remarks the European parliament\u2019s president Martin Schulz has also made today, says Helena Smith in Athens.</p> <blockquote> <p>Martin\u2019s Schulz\u2019s prediction that Greece will be forced to mint a new currency in the event of a \u2018no\u2019 vote has been causing waves.

The head of Germany\u2019s Ifo institute, Hans-Werner Sinn, also suggested a temporary Grexit on Friday.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5598f815e4b032a39a3ba7ff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-05T09:32:10.300Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB policymaker: central bank prepared 'to do more'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Central Bank stands ready to take additional measures if necessary, ECB executive board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 said this morning.

Here are his comments in full, courtesy of Reuters. </p> <p>He said in Athens\u2019 working class district of Kypseli, where he is registered to vote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many people can ignore the will of a government. But no one can ignore the will of a people.</p> <p>Today is a day of celebration, because democracy is a celebration, it is joy. And when democracy overcomes fear and extortion, then it becomes a redemption and a way out. The Greek people today send a very strong message. A message of dignity and determination. The message that they hold a choice in their hands. No one can ignore the will of a people to live. To live with determination and take their life in their own hands.</p> <p>I am certain that from tomorrow we will have broken a path for all the peoples in Europe. A path of return to the founding values of democracy and solidarity in Europe, sending a strong message of determination, not only to stay but also to live with dignity in Europe. To do well and work as equals among equals. Let us therefore make this act of strong will, this celebratory act of democracy, an act of determination for a better future for all of us, both in Greece and Europe. I am very optimistic.\u201d</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidCharter/statuses/617598270425186305\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tsipras?src=hash\">#Tsipras</a> is mobbed by the media after voting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greferendum?src=hash\">#Greferendum</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/xJQdASnFt3\">pic.twitter.com/xJQdASnFt3</a></p>&mdash; David Charter (@DavidCharter) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidCharter/status/617598270425186305\">July 5, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-07-05T09:59:26.965Z\">at 10.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5598f2a2e4b00bdd27707ce1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-07-05T09:07:01.744Z\">10.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Polling stations in Greece are open until 7pm local time (5pm BST), but there are suggestions that they could stay open later if they run short of envelopes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DavidCharter/statuses/617613644856213504\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Oxi or Nai?
