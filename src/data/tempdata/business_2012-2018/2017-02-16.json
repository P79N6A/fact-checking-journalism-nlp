      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, after a lively session that saw MSCI\u2019s all-country index hit record highs this morning. But with Europe ending lower, and a mixed close on Wall Street, the rally may be taking a breather. I\u2019ll be back in the morning to see if world markets can hit fresh highs again. Goodnight! DING DING! The closing bell has rung on Wall Street, and the Dow Jones industrial average has hit a new closing high for the 6th day running. But it\u2019s only a small move - the Dow ended the day up 7 points, or a meagre 0.04% at 20,619 points. The broader S&amp;P 500 index, and the tech-focused Nasdaq both finished marginally lower, after five days of gains. Energy stocks ended the day in the red, with Chevon down 1.9% and Exxon down 1.1%. Caterpillar was another faller, down 0.85%. But Cisco Systems gained 2.4% and Coca Cola bubbled up by around 1.9%. With less than an hour\u2019s trading to go, the Dow is down a modest 13 points or 0.06%. Energy firms, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, and financial stocks such as Goldman Sachs have lost ground. But tech firms, including Cisco and Intel, are up. After a run of strong gains, the US dollar has dropped back today - suffering its biggest drop in two weeks. Currency traders are having second thoughts about the chances of an interest rate hike in March. The dollar bounced on Tuesday after Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated it would be a mistake to leave rates unchanged for too long - but that move is fading, with investors keen to hear more details of president Trump\u2019s tax and spending plans. Here\u2019s a couple of shots from the New York stock exchange, as traders watched the Dow Jones, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq hit new alltime highs. Traders are keeping a close eye on the famous Wall Street \u2018fear index after it a two-week high today. The CBOE volatility index, or VIX, is now at its highest level since the end of January, following an 11% surge yesterday. That\u2019s a sign that investors are somewhat jittery about the solidity of the market rally. The VIX is calculated from the cost of buying options on the S&amp;P 500 in a month\u2019s time, so shows if traders are trying to protect themselves from a crash. It\u2019s still quite low in historical terms, at around 12.05 right now. Shares have been driven high in recent weeks by Donald Trump\u2019s promise of a \u2018phenomenal\u2019 tax reform plan. However, we still don\u2019t have any details...and that is starting to worry some investors. Tracy Maeter, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Philadelphia, says: \u201cSome of these policies are game changers to certain sectors, and the market is being somewhat rational in terms of taking a bit of a breather before we have more facts as opposed to plans or intention. Trump is giving a press conference now, to announce his nomination for Labor secretary. It\u2019s Alexander Acosta, dean of Florida International University College of Law. He\u2019s taking the opportunity to lambast the media, but not to outline any stimulus measures. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, fears that the market boom will turn sour, eventually. He writes: For the time being, Wall Street is being supported by negative real interest rates and the prospect of tax cuts to come. That means stock market records will continue to be broken over the months ahead. Until the moment comes when traders get spooked by rising interest rates, burgeoning budget deficits, protectionism or a combination of all three. Wall Street is getting intoxicated on irrational exuberance. But remember: the wilder the party, the bigger the hangover. And here\u2019s a chart of the CAPE index, which measures share prices compared to company earnings - and is back at levels seen before serious crashes.... Hello again. European stock markets have ended the day slightly in the red, after helping to push global equities to record highs this morning. In London the FTSE 100 finished down 24 points, thanks to some big names going ex-dividend, and drops in mining companies. The pound strengthened a little during the day, breaking above $1.25 before dipping back. The US markets are bobbing around the break-even level, having hit new alltime highs at the start of trading after the strong manufacturing report from Philadelphia. Emerging markets did better, with China and India both up 0.5%, Russia gaining 0.3%. Speaking of Russia.... Joshua Mahony of IG reckons the unfolding firestorm over the Trump administration\u2019s contacts with Moscow have hurt share prices. He says: Growing concerns about contact between President Trump\u2019s team and Russia ahead of last November\u2019s election has tempered the rally in global stock markets today, with the FTSE dropping back a little. A drop in the US dollar is a sign that markets are growing increasingly worried over whether any notable link can be found between Russian intelligence agencies and the Trump campaign team. ABN Amro\u2019s chief investment officer Didier Duret, says markets are being driven higher by recent solid economic data: With the exception of politics, I have rarely seen such a network of positive signals. \u201cThere is a momentum, we don\u2019t know when it will stop, but at the moment it is strong. Investors are rather underinvested anyway and there is lots of cash so equities are the asset class of default in this environment.\u201d That\u2019s a good moment for a break, but I\u201dll be back later with the market close.... NEWSFLASH: The US stock market has hit fresh highs at the start of trading in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq have all moved higher, as the rally that has driven global markets to new heights continues. Today\u2019s strong housing data, jobs figures and manufacturing surveys are all helping to underpin optimism on Wall Street. However... the VIX \u2018fear index\u2019, which measures nervousness in the markets, is pushing towards its highest level in a month. It\u2019s still low in historic terms, though, as this chart shows: A reader has got in touch about this morning\u2019s reference to \u2018animal spirits driving the markets\u2019. It\u2019s a phrase popularised by John Maynard Keynes, who wrote about how optimism, rather than deep-rooted analysis, drives many of our decisions. As he put it: Most, probably, of our decisions to do something positive, the full consequences of which will be drawn out over many days to come, can only be taken as the result of animal spirits\u2014a spontaneous urge to action rather than inaction, and not as the outcome of a weighted average of quantitative benefits multiplied by quantitative probabilities. And bang on cue, here\u2019s someone else using the term today too... Although the surge in the Philadelphia Fed factory index to a 33-year high is impressive, it isn\u2019t enough to make the US economy great again on its own. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, explains why: We do expect to see an acceleration in manufacturing output and employment growth this year but, just as we didn\u2019t think that the downturn in 2015 and 2016 would plunge the wider economy into recession, we don\u2019t expect this revival to spill over into much faster GDP growth. Manufacturing is simply too small a part of the overall economy now. Boom! Factories in the Philadelphia area are growing at their fastest rate in three decades. That\u2019s according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which provides fresh evidence that America\u2019s economy is strengthening. The Philadelphia Fed business conditions index has surged to 43.3 in January, the strongest reading since the mid-1980s. Firms in the mid-Atlantic region reported a pick-up in new orders and shipments, indicating solid demand for their goods. The latest US unemployment data also looks pretty decent. Some 239,000 people filed new \u2018initial claims\u2019 to receive jobless benefit last week, up from 234,000, but less than expected. Any reading below 240,000 is rather impressive, points out financial research group Bespoke Investment. Just in: The number of permits being granted to build a house in America has hit a 14-month high. Permits for new construction jumped by 4.6% in January, to an annual rate of 1.29 million units - the highest number since November 2015. That may indicate optimism in the US construction sector. However....the number of actual new housing starts dipped in January, by 2.6%. That\u2019s still better than economist had expected, though. I\u2019m afraid Donald Trump\u2019s upbeat tweet about the stock market hitting its \u2018longest winning streak in decades\u2019 may be a bit of Fake News. Strictly speaking, the three main US stock market benchmarks have all hit record highs for five days in a row -- the first time this has happened in 25 years. But this isn\u2019t actually the longest winning streak on record, at all. Currently, the S&amp;P 500 is only on its best run in under four years. Marketwatch has the details: In terms of winning streaks, the S&amp;P has risen for seven consecutive trading days for its longest stretch of up days since September 2013, when it also rose for seven straight sessions. That\u2019s according to Dow Jones data. The Dow has gained for five straight days, its best stretch since December, and the Nasdaq has been up for seven sessions in a row, its best streak since its seven-session advance that ended Jan. 11. The European Central Bank has just broken the news drought by releasing the minutes of January\u2019s meeting. They show that policymakers were keen to remain \u2018patient\u2019 and not tighten monetary policy too fast. Here\u2019s the key section: The Governing Council was seen as well advised to remain patient and maintain a \u2018steady hand\u2019 to provide stability and predictability in an environment still characterised by a high level of uncertainty. The recent increases in energy prices had thus far not translated into indirect or second-round effects on broader inflation.\u201d But are they right? After all, inflation has just surged to 1.8%, from 1.1% in December.... Away from the markets...the president of General Motors has arrived in Westminster for talks with the UK government. On the agenda: GM\u2019s plan to sell its Vauxhall division, which employs 4,500 people in Britain, to France\u2019s PSA Group. ITV\u2019s Joel Hills snapped Dan Ammann arriving for talks with UK business secretary Greg Clark. The unions are very concerned that jobs could be threatened by the sale, and are pushing Clark to offer guarantees to protect staff. After all, it has already made some mysterious pledges to Nissan to encourage it to keep making cars in Sunderland. Look who wants to take the credit for the market rally..... Here\u2019s a chart showing how business activity and raw materials prices have both risen in recent months, hinting at stronger growth.... ...and another one showing how consumer prices are rising faster than expected too. Currency traders are taking a break from worrying about Brexit, says Jane Foley of Rabobank. But once Britain actually triggers Article 50, to begin the exit process from the EU, the pound may come under more pressure again. Foley says (via Reuters): Once the talks start properly the full complexity of the situation will become a lot more obvious.... Sterling will be up for a rocky ride at the very best.\u201d Much of the FTSE 100\u2019s weakness this morning is due to some major companies going \u2018ex-dividend\u2019 (meaning shareholders no longer quality for the next payout). Chris Beauchamp of IG explains: The FTSE 100 is trading modestly lower this morning, but most of these losses can be explained away by a number of big names going ex-dividend. BP, Shell, AstraZeneca and Imperial Brands are all trading without the benefit of the dividend, and with these heavyweights in the red it is going to be tough for the market to push higher. Given the steady rally we have seen over the past week or more, however, some weakness is to be welcomed, taking a little heat out of the market. For now, the bulls remain unconcerned. Having hit a one-month high yesterday, London\u2019s stock market is slightly spoiling today\u2019s narrative by dipping in early trading. Mining companies and oil producers are falling, pulling the FTSE 100 down by 30 points to 7272. That\u2019s partly due to the pound gaining against the US dollar; up half a cent to $1.25, cutting the value of revenues earned overseas in dollars. Other European markets are a little lower, after posting seven days of gains in a row - helping to drive global markets to record highs. Global stocks are now worryingly high, according to one well-respected measure that compares the price of shares with company earnings. The Cyclically Adjusted price/earnings ratio (CAPE), formulated by economist Robert Shiller, is now almost 29; close to its level before the Black Tuesday crash of 1929. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a crash is coming today - as FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed explains: Very few experts may disagree that valuations are overstretched, and that investors are willing to pay more premium on prospects of aggressive fiscal plans. We can even go further to discuss that bubbles are being formed, and Professor Robert Shiller\u2019s CAPE PE ratio supports this opinion as it approaches 29. However, bubbles may grow bigger, even much bigger before they burst, if animal spirits continue to drive the rally. CAPE\u2019s all-time record is actually 45 - a level hit in 2000 as the dot-com boom surged. That didn\u2019t end well..... Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, reckons that the rally has further to run -- despite concerns that valuations have risen too high. US equity indices posted fresh record highs on Wednesday, and the FTSE 100 is less than 50 points away from its record 7,354 level reached in mid-January. The lead indicators for the markets, including the Dow Jones Transportation Index and the Russell 2000 also scaled to fresh heights, suggesting that this rally is here to stay, even as some economists and analysts\u2019 rush to argue that markets are stretched, volumes are low and valuations are too high. But.... Donald Trump could potentially sent the markets spinning, she adds. The Russian Ruble was one of the worst performers yesterday, this came after President Trump tweeted that President Obama was too soft on Russia over its invasion of Crimea. What about the Trump/ Putin bromance that has been blossoming and driving the ruble higher? We doubt that it is over, and would imagine that relationship has a long way to run. But it\u2019s a keen reminder that President Trump, rather than valuation measures, are a bigger threat to the stock market rally. There should be some red faces in the City over this stock market rally. Many experts predicted that stocks would plunge if Donald Trump won the US election - instead, trillions has been wiped onto share values since November. Optimism over American economy is helping to drive markets to record levels, says the Financial Times. The FT argues that hopes for faster economic growth has \u201cgalvanised markets from the US to Europe\u201d. Wall Street has led the rally since Donald Trump captured the White House, hardening expectations that the US expansion will quicken just as the Japanese, Chinese and eurozone economies show signs of improvement. And that has driven the FTSE All-World index (another measure of global markets) over its previous peak in 2015: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. World stock markets have hit their highest ever levels, as the bullish optimism rippling through global trading floor around the globe refuses to abate. MSCI\u2019s World Index, which tracks shares in 46 markets, has climbed over its previous high (set in 2015) overnight, and hitting 444.29 points for the first time ever. The surge came as US stock markets hit fresh peaks last night. So what\u2019s driving it? 1) Optimism over the global economy. Recent economic data has shown little sign that global growth is cooling off, despite last year\u2019s Brexit shocks and upcoming elections in Europe. 2) Expectations of higher inflation. Prices are rising in America, Europe and the UK, with the US CPI hitting a four-year high yesterday. This is likely to lead to higher interest rates, with a US rate hike possible in March. So some traders will be selling bonds and shifting money into shares. 3) The Trump Trade. Investors are still betting that the US president will deliver on his pledges for a \u2018phenomenal\u2019 tax reform package, and infrastructure spending - despite Donald Trump\u2019s various missteps since taking office. Financial stocks have been surging since Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the White House in November. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, has the details: Whatever political problems President Trump maybe having on the staffing front with resignations and the like financial markets remain largely ambivalent, choosing to focus on last week\u2019s promise to deliver something \u201cphenomenal\u201d in a couple of weeks\u2019 time, as US markets hit new record highs for the fifth day in a row, driven by banks and financials. Both Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan shares have hit record levels, with the financial sector up 22% since the 8th November, while here in the UK the FTSE250 has also managed to post record highs five days in succession, as UK stocks appear to be becoming a haven from political concerns in Europe. Optimism about the global outlook is improving as economic data continues to improve and inflations starts to take hold, and last night\u2019s positive US finish is set to wash through into another positive open this morning. Also coming up today... There\u2019s not much in the economic calendar, apart from: 12.30pm GMT: The European Central Bank publishes an account of its last monetary policy meeting 1.30pm GMT: New US housing starts and building permits data 1.30pm GMT: The weekly US jobless claims figures",

      "bodyText": "Argos is being forced to pay \u00a32.4m in wages to more than 37,000 current and former shopworkers, and has been fined nearly \u00a31.5m after a HMRC investigation. The catalogue and online retailer, which was bought by Sainsbury\u2019s last year, wrote to staff on Thursday after it was found to have been paying less than the legal minimum wage to workers, because it was asking them to attend staff briefings and carry out security checks outside the working hours for which they were paid. However, Argos will only pay the tax authority \u00a3800,000 because it has been awarded a discount on the fine for agreeing to pay up within 14 days. The underpayments of about \u00a364 per person date back to 2014 and were first uncovered last year ahead of Argos\u2019s takeover by Sainsbury\u2019s. The supermarket said it had changed processes as quickly as possible last December after being made aware of the issue, and would be repaying staff at the end of this month. The underpayment affects 12,000 current employees and more than 25,000 former staff. The number of workers underpaid by Argos is well in excess of those shortchanged by Debenhams, which on Wednesday became the most prolific offender to be \u201cnamed and shamed\u201d by the government under a system that came into force in 2013. The department store chain was fined \u00a363,000 and forced to pay back nearly \u00a3135,000 to 12,000 workers. The company said it had underpaid staff by an average of \u00a310 each in 2015 because of a \u201ctechnical error in its payroll calculations\u201d. Argos\u2019s underpayment is also well ahead of the \u00a31m awarded in back pay to Sports Direct workers after a HMRC investigation last year. About 200 people directly employed by Mike Ashley\u2019s retail group and about 3,000 staff hired through temporary employment agencies were found to have been paid less than the minimum wage over four years. Argos is expected to be named and shamed by the government later this year. In a letter to staff, John Rogers, who became the chief executive of Argos after it was acquired by Sainsbury\u2019s last September, said the issue had been uncovered by HMRC as part of a \u201croutine visit\u201d and he had been informed after the deal was completed. \u201cUnexpected things do come up as we get to grips with the business,\u201d he said. \u201cSainsbury\u2019s prides itself on being a trusted brand where people love to work and I was therefore very disappointed to hear this, and launched an immediate investigation.\u201d Rogers said Sainsbury\u2019s was planning to raise wages for the lowest-paid Argos staff aged over 25 from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.66 an hour, and extend a discount on Sainsbury\u2019s shopping to them. The \u201cnational living wage\u201d, the legal minimum for over 25s, will rise from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.50 in April. The underpayment at Argos emerged after the government named and shamed a record 360 companies for failing to pay either the national minimum wage or national living wage earlier this week. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \u201cEvery worker in the UK is entitled to at least the national minimum or living wage. That is why we named and shamed more than 350 employers who failed to pay the legal minimum this week, sending the clear message to employers that minimum wage abuses will not go unpunished.\u201d Dave Gill, a national officer for shop workers\u2019 union Usdaw, said: \u201cWe have been in talks with the company to get this situation resolved as a matter of urgency. Our members in Argos are clearly disappointed to have been underpaid and we are seeking safeguards to ensure that this cannot occur again.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "All three main measures of the health in the stock market are at record levels. Donald Trump is bragging about the boost he has given to share prices. Bourses around the world are taking their lead from Wall Street and heading higher. What does that mean? It means the stock market is going to crash because sooner or later optimism breeds recklessness and boom will turn to bust. All that\u2019s in question is how big the bubble will get before it bursts and when that moment will come. Let\u2019s be clear, that moment is still a way off. Markets are in that part of the cycle where every piece of news is a reason to buy equities. Rising inflation? A sign that the global economy is picking up speed, which is good for corporate profits. Hints from the Federal Reserve that it is contemplating another increase in US interest rates? An expression of confidence by America\u2019s central bank in the health of the world\u2019s biggest economy. Wall Street is also salivating at the prospect of nice fat tax cuts from Trump. The White House will announce details of its plans shortly but they are certain to involve a hefty cut in corporation tax. Another reason to pile into the stock market. The other indication of a bubble mentality is that all bad news is ignored or downplayed. So, investors seem blissfully unconcerned that Trump might trigger a new global trade war or by his chaotic foreign policy. The risks of a victory for the far right in the imminent Dutch and French elections are being brushed under the carpet. Keynes provided the best explanation for this kind of herd behaviour, noting that markets can remain irrational longer than investors can stay solvent. A fund manager might think stocks are already richly valued but if everybody else is buying then the temptation is to swallow any doubts and do likewise. Traditionally, one of the best yardsticks for whether shares are over-valued or under-valued has been the cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio constructed by the economist Robert Shiller. This ratio is currently at about 29 and has only twice been higher: in 1929 ahead of the Wall Street Crash, and in the last frantic months of the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. Already, reasons are being put forward for why Shiller\u2019s metrics are not applicable to today\u2019s market conditions. Whenever the words \u201cit\u2019s different this time\u201d are uttered it is a sure sign of trouble ahead. For the time being, Wall Street is being supported by negative real interest rates and the prospect of tax cuts to come. That means stock market records will continue to be broken over the months ahead. Until the moment comes when traders get spooked by rising interest rates, burgeoning budget deficits, protectionism or a combination of all three. Wall Street is getting intoxicated on irrational exuberance. But remember: the wilder the party, the bigger the hangover. Business rates trumps Brexit worries Forget Brexit. For Britain\u2019s army of small companies, the burning issue of the moment is not the triggering of the article 50 divorce negotiations with the EU but the imminent shake-up of business rates. The poll conducted by the Federation of Small Businesses suggests that the Treasury\u2019s claim that the first revaluation in seven years will be revenue-neutral has fallen on deaf ears. Three-quarters of respondents said business rates were the single biggest issue affecting them, a long way ahead of economic uncertainty. The Treasury is coming up against two of the iron laws of taxation. Any changes create losers as well as winners. And the losers tend to be a lot more vociferous than the winners. The current changes are proving particularly controversial. Business rates are an annual tax on commercial properties based on their rental value and the latest uprating is based on changes in property prices since 2008. That has led to glaring anomalies. A small independent bookshop in London will be facing a whopping increase in business rates, while Amazon\u2019s out of town distribution warehouses are set for a tax cut. The government has made much of the progress it has made in cutting corporation tax but business rates are far more important for most companies, particularly the smaller ones. Unless ministers want to see even more charity shops in high streets they should make good on pledges to provide transitional relief. Even better would be a reduction in business rates paid for by a penny on corporation tax.",

Markets are in that part of the cycle where every piece of news is a reason to buy equities. Rising inflation? A sign that the global economy is picking up speed, which is good for corporate profits. Hints from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve </a>that it is contemplating another increase in US interest rates? An expression of confidence by America\u2019s central bank in the health of the world\u2019s biggest economy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/feb/16/world-stock-markets-record-highs-ftse-trump-inflation-business-live\">World stock markets hit record highs \u2013 business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wall Street is also salivating at the prospect of nice fat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/24/federal-debt-deficit-trump-budget\">tax cuts from Trump</a>. The White House will announce details of its plans shortly but they are certain to involve a hefty cut in corporation tax. Another reason to pile into the stock market.</p> <p>The other indication of a bubble mentality is that all bad news is ignored or downplayed. So, investors seem blissfully unconcerned that Trump might trigger a new global trade war or by his chaotic foreign policy. The risks of a victory for the far right in the imminent Dutch and French elections are being brushed under the carpet.</p> <p>Keynes provided the best explanation for this kind of herd behaviour, noting that markets can remain irrational longer than investors can stay solvent. A fund manager might think stocks are already richly valued but if everybody else is buying then the temptation is to swallow any doubts and do likewise.</p> <p>Traditionally, one of the best yardsticks for whether shares are over-valued or under-valued has been the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclically_adjusted_price-to-earnings_ratio\">cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio</a> constructed by the economist Robert Shiller. This ratio is currently at about 29 and has only twice been higher: in 1929 ahead of the Wall Street Crash, and in the last frantic months of the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2017-02-16T16:18:35/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Price to earnings ratio graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2017-02-16T16:18:35/embed.html\">Price to earnings ratio graph</a> </figure>  <p>Already, reasons are being put forward for why Shiller\u2019s metrics are not applicable to today\u2019s market conditions. Whenever the words \u201cit\u2019s different this time\u201d are uttered it is a sure sign of trouble ahead.</p> <p>For the time being, Wall Street is being supported by negative real interest rates and the prospect of tax cuts to come. That means stock market records will continue to be broken over the months ahead. </p> <p>Until the moment comes when traders get spooked by rising interest rates, burgeoning budget deficits, protectionism or a combination of all three. Wall Street is getting intoxicated on irrational exuberance. But remember: the wilder the party, the bigger the hangover.</p> <h2>Business rates trumps Brexit worries</h2> <p>Forget <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>. For Britain\u2019s army of small companies, the burning issue of the moment is not the triggering of the article 50 divorce negotiations with the EU but the imminent shake-up of business rates.</p> <p>The poll conducted by the Federation of Small Businesses suggests that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/16/treasury-hits-back-at-scaremongering-over-business-rate-changes\">Treasury\u2019s claim </a>that the first revaluation in seven years will be revenue-neutral has fallen on deaf ears. Three-quarters of respondents said business rates were the single biggest issue affecting them, a long way ahead of economic uncertainty.</p> <p>The Treasury is coming up against two of the iron laws of taxation. Any changes create losers as well as winners. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/25/cash-strapped-hospitals-ask-for-a-15bn-rebate\">And the losers tend to be a lot more vociferous than the winners.</a></p> <p>The current changes are proving particularly controversial. Business rates are an annual tax on commercial properties based on their rental value and the latest uprating is based on changes in property prices since 2008.</p> <p>That has led to glaring anomalies. A small independent bookshop in London will be facing a whopping increase in business rates, while Amazon\u2019s out of town distribution warehouses are set for a tax cut. <br></p> <p>The government has made much of the progress it has made in cutting corporation tax but business rates are far more important for most companies, particularly the smaller ones. Unless ministers want to see even more charity shops in high streets they should make good on pledges to provide transitional relief. Even better would be a reduction in business rates paid for by a penny on corporation tax.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK business secretary has said he has been reassured about the future of General Motors\u2019 Vauxhall production operations in Britain, following a meeting with the US carmaker\u2019s chairman. Greg Clark sought an urgent meeting with senior GM management after the US car company announced earlier this week it was in talks to sell its European Opel business, including the Vauxhall operations in the UK, to France\u2019s PSA Group, which owns Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn. The Vauxhall plants in Luton in Bedfordshire and Ellesmere Port in Cheshire employ 4,500 staff. Thousands more jobs rely on its UK supply chain. Clark met GM president Dan Ammann and Len McCluskey, general secretary of trade union Unite, in London on Thursday. Speaking after the meeting, Clark said he had been reassured by the company\u2019s intention to build on the success of its Vauxhall assets. On Thursday evening he was reported to be travelling to Paris for meetings with the French industry minister, Christophe Sirugue, and PSA Group board members. \u201cThere is some way to go in discussions between GM and PSA but I was reassured by GM\u2019s intention, communicated to me, to build on the success of these operations rather than rationalise them,\u201d Clark said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to be in close contact with GM and PSA in the days and weeks ahead.\u201d However, GM issued a more circumspect statement. \u201cWhile we have no definitive news to report at this time, we can affirm that our objective in exploring opportunities with PSA Group is to build on the success of Opel Vauxhall and to put the business and the operations in the strongest possible position for the future,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe look forward to engaging with our stakeholders as part of these ongoing discussions.\u201d McCluskey called on the government to ensure that the interests of British workers are looked after in talks between the two companies and ministers in Paris and Berlin. \u201cMy immediate priority now is to understand where Peugeot is now in this process, which is why I am contacting the CEO of the company, Carlos Tavares, to request urgent talks. \u201cUnite is committed to talking to all the concerned parties in the UK, Germany and France to ensure that the case for the UK workers is pressed at the highest levels. \u201cBut I also say this; our government should demand that whenever the carmakers are meeting with the French and German governments, then the UK government must be at the same table.\u201d Ammann headed to London after he and GM\u2019s chief executive, Mary Barra, flew to Germany on Wednesday for talks at Opel\u2019s headquarters in R\u00fcsselsheim am Main, near Frankfurt. He will also hold talks with Vauxhall executives in London before returning to the US. Opel employs about 35,600 people across Europe, including 18,250 in Germany. Berlin has vowed to intervene to protect German jobs if the deal goes ahead. In a letter to Vauxhall staff sent on Tuesday, Barra wrote: \u201cOur companies are currently exploring numerous strategic initiatives aimed at improving the profitability and operational efficiency of GM and PSA Groupe, including a potential acquisition of Opel Vauxhall by PSA Groupe. Such discussions are ongoing. \u201cWhile there can be no assurance of any agreement, any possible transaction would enable PSA Groupe and Opel Vauxhall to leverage their complementary strengths, enhancing their competitive positions for the future in a rapidly changing European market. GM and PSA Groupe would each be able to capitalise fully on their respective strategic priorities. We would seek to ensure any transaction would serve the best interests of all our respective important stakeholders.\u201d Barra urged workers not to let the talks become a \u201cdistraction to the important work you are doing\u201d. Howard Wheeldon, a veteran analyst in the City, said: \u201cVauxhall Cars can survive as an assembler of cars in the UK provided that its management, workers and trade unions come together and find an alternative plan.\u201d He said Ellesmere Port could well lose out under PSA ownership and suggested that management and others could look into buying out the plant from GM. Credit ratings agency Moody\u2019s said the deal would make strategic sense for PSA because it \u201ccould release substantial synergies and improve PSA\u2019s market position in Europe where the company continuously lost market share since 2010\u201d. Lead analyst Falk Frey said: \u201cWhile we caution that the acquisition would increase further PSA\u2019s reliance on the European market to more than two thirds of group sales from 61% in 2016, diversification within Europe would increase as Opel is strong in markets where PSA is not, ie Germany and the UK.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Southern rail users face more strikes as drivers reject Aslef-backed deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Southern rail drivers have rejected a deal negotiated between the Aslef union and their employer, reigniting a long-running dispute that has frequently stranded hundreds of thousands of commuters. The drivers voted by 54% to 46% against an agreement that offered limited assurances on rostering a second, safety-trained crew member in return for accepting Southern\u2019s government-led plans for more driver-only operation. More strikes are likely to follow once the union\u2019s executive has decided on the next course of action. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said: \u201cWe understand and support the decision arrived at democratically by our members and will now work to deliver a resolution in line with their expectations.\u201d The proposed deal was agreed by Aslef negotiators and Southern on 2 February after two weeks of talks brokered by the TUC, and was heralded as signalling the end of a dispute that had contributed to making Southern, run by Govia Thameslink Railway, the worst-performing train operator in Britain. Many drivers were angered when the terms of the deal were revealed in the following days, including concessions on a key principle that a train can run in certain circumstances with only a driver on board. But drivers had lost significant pay both through a series of strikes and an overtime ban from early December that had closed branch lines and severely disrupted services, and Aslef believed most would accept the deal its leadership had recommended. Nick Brown, the chief operating officer of Govia Thameslink Railway, said: \u201cNaturally we\u2019re saddened and hugely disappointed, as will be our passengers, with today\u2019s decision by drivers, particularly as the agreement carried the full support and recommendation of the Aslef leadership. \u201cWe now need to understand the issues which led to this outcome and we\u2019ll be seeking to meet with the union as soon as possible to see how we can agree a way forward.\u201d A Department for Transport spokesman described the outcome as disappointing. \u201cThe union leadership must now return to talks and work with their members on a deal they can back,\u201d he said. Opposition politicians demanded the government step in and take control of the service. Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green party and MP for Brighton Pavilion, said ministers had \u201cutterly failed to get a grip on the rail crisis\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that the drivers have rejected this proposed deal, as the offer didn\u2019t include maintaining the presence of a guard on every train, which is key to safety. It\u2019s now time for the government to step in and bring this line into public hands. Southern are running our service into the ground.\u201d The Liberal Democrat transport spokeswoman, Jenny Randerson, said: \u201cThe government must stop dithering and act rapidly to take direct control of this failed rail franchise.\u201d The RMT union, which has been at the forefront of the dispute with Southern since last April, representing the conductors who were downgraded to onboard supervisors, was not involved in the talks at the TUC and denounced the agreement as a \u201chistoric betrayal\u201d. Talks between Southern and the RMT at Acas this week foundered on the first day, and the union has called another 24-hour strike for 22 February. Southern says it expects to run about three-quarters of its usual timetable during the strike. The row over the roles and responsibilities of train crew is likely to be replicated across other parts of Britain\u2019s railways. A ballot for strikes on the Northern network began on Thursday over what the RMT described as a \u201cfailure to give assurances on guards\u201d, with new trains expected from 2018 that could be operated by drivers alone. Merseyrail plans to operate trains without guards from 2020, although it has promised to redeploy staff. The government is encouraging bidders for future franchises, including South West, to come up with plans to phase out guards, with new trains designed to be operated by drivers alone.",

It\u2019s now time for the government to step in and bring this line into public hands. Southern are running our service into the ground.\u201d</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat transport spokeswoman, Jenny Randerson, said: \u201cThe government must stop dithering and act rapidly to take direct control of this failed rail franchise.\u201d</p> <p>The RMT union, which has been at the forefront of the dispute with Southern since last April, representing the conductors who were downgraded to onboard supervisors, was not involved in the talks at the TUC and denounced the agreement as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/04/rmt-attacks-aslef-deal-in-southern-rail-dispute\">\u201chistoric betrayal\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Talks between Southern and the RMT at Acas this week foundered on the first day, and the union has called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/15/southern-rail-workers-new-strike-date-talks-collapse\">another 24-hour strike</a> for 22 February. Southern says it expects to run about three-quarters of its usual timetable during the strike.</p> <p>The row over the roles and responsibilities of train crew is likely to be replicated across other parts of Britain\u2019s railways. A ballot for strikes on the Northern network began on Thursday over what the RMT described as a \u201cfailure to give assurances on guards\u201d, with new trains expected from 2018 that could be operated by drivers alone. </p> <p>Merseyrail plans to operate trains without guards from 2020, although it has promised to redeploy staff. The government is encouraging bidders for future franchises, including South West, to come up with plans to phase out guards, with new trains designed to be operated by drivers alone.</p>",

The Competition and Markets Authority said it would assess whether the Heineken deal could reduce competition and choice for customers. If the CMA finds this to be the case, it will launch an in-depth merger investigation, which could last up to 24 weeks, unless the two firms address any competition concerns. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association, which has been critical of the planned takeover, hailed the news. Its chief executive, Paul Waterson, said: \u201cHeineken is a global brewer, with very different priorities to their customers, who often rely on hard-earned local relationships to make their businesses work.

We look forward to receiving the findings of the investigation.\u201d Heineken entered the UK pub market in 2008 when it took over brewing company Scottish and Newcastle. It is the world\u2019s second biggest brewer behind the Budweiser maker Anheuser-Busch InBev, which took over SABMiller in a \u00a379bn deal last year. Heineken\u2019s beer and cider brands include Amstel, Foster\u2019s, Birra Moretti, Kronenbourg 1664, Sagres, Bulmers and Strongbow. Heineken runs 1,049 pubs in the UK in its Star Bars and Pubs estate. If the Punch deal goes through, Heineken will be Britain\u2019s third largest pub group, after Greene King and Enterprise Inns. The Dutch company said the CMA\u2019s announcement was an \u201cimportant and fully expected stage\u201d in the acquisition process and that the company would fully cooperate with the watchdog. Punch said it \u201ccontinues to expect the transaction to complete as anticipated\u201d. Heineken faces a backlash from UK pub landlords, who fear they may be forced to stock their pubs with Heineken-owned brands, reducing choice for customers. Heineken normally aims to ensure that its own products make up 85% of what is sold in its pubs, although it has not said whether this would apply to Punch pubs. Heineken has dismissed publicans\u2019 fears, saying they will still have a say over which beers they sell, and pledged to work with independent brewers.

    "webTitle": "How Donald Trump became Deutsche Bank's biggest headache", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The language was scathing, the tone sarcastic. \u201c[Donald] Trump proclaims himself the archetypal businessman, a deal-maker without peer,\u201d the memo said. It mentioned Trump\u2019s boast that he was worth \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d. And it listed his interests in \u201cnumerous extraordinary properties\u201d across the world, from New York to Panama, not to mention his latest golf course in Scotland. Another document noted: \u201cTrump is no stranger to overdue debt.\u201d The angry memos were written by lawyers acting on behalf of Deutsche Bank, Germany\u2019s biggest lender, which was suing the billionaire. It was November 2008. Three-and-a-half years earlier the bank had loaned Trump the cash to build one of his grandest projects yet: a hotel and mega-tower in Chicago. Trump had given his personal guarantee he would repay the $640m. As per agreement, he was now due to hand over a large chunk, $40m. There was only one problem: the future 45th president of the United States was refusing to pay up. Deutsche initiated legal action. Trump responded with a blistering, scarcely credible writ of his own, a 10-count complaint in New York\u2019s supreme court, in the county of Queens. In it, Trump adopted a highly unusual defence, known as \u201cforce majeure\u201d. He claimed that the 2008 economic crisis was a \u201conce-in-a-century credit tsunami\u201d, an act of God that was equivalent to an earthquake. Since it couldn\u2019t have been anticipated, and it wasn\u2019t his fault, he wasn\u2019t obliged to pay Deutsche anything. It wouldn\u2019t get the $40m or the outstanding $330m, his writ said. He went further. Trump claimed Deutsche Bank had actually helped cause the crunch. Therefore it owed him. Trump demanded $3bn from Deutsche in compensation. Its New York property division first loaned money to him in 1998 at a time when the bank was attempting to expand its commercial real estate portfolio. By that stage, other major banks were becoming cautious about Trump, in part, the Wall Street Journal has said, because of frustration with his business practices. A decade later, Deutsche was to find out for itself quite how capricious and unpredictable he could be. In the 2008 suit the bank\u2019s unhappy lawyers quote from Trump\u2019s book Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and in Life. On his struggle with banks in the 1990s, Trump writes: \u201cI figured it was the banks\u2019 problem, not mine. What the hell did I care? I actually told one bank, \u2018I told you you shouldn\u2019t have loaned me that money\u2019.\u201d At the same moment Trump was suing Deutsche he was telling the Scotsman newspaper he was a very rich individual, with a \u201cbillion in cash\u201d. He was willing to spend it on his latest project: a golf course and hotel near Balmedie in Aberdeenshire. Controversially approved by then first minister Alex Salmond and the Scottish government, it would be the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d, Trump said. It was what happened next that strikes many in the banking world as unusual \u2013 bizarre, even. In 2005 Trump had borrowed money from Deutsche\u2019s commercial real estate division. In 2010 the parties settled their legal differences. But rather than walking away, the bank\u2019s private wealth division then resumed lending to Trump, the troublesome four-times bankrupt client who had defaulted on a major loan. Why? It\u2019s unclear what assurances Trump offered. He had given his word before, only to break it. Deutsche has refused to discuss its lending arrangements to the first family. Its clients also include Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, her husband, Jared Kushner, and Kushner\u2019s mother, Seryl Stadtmauer. Kushner is a senior White House adviser. Just before the US election Deutsche refinanced $370m he owes against commercial property in Manhattan belonging to Kushner\u2019s company. Sources inside Deutsche say the investment banking side of the business is entirely separate from the private bank that handles the Trumps. Personal relationships also play an important role in private banking. Even so, banking experts have told the Guardian it is unusual for a private bank to take on such loans, and unbelievable that a bank would continue to deal with a man who had refused to pay his debt, and then countersued using force majeure. One former Deutsche employee, based in New York, said: \u201cReal estate refused to deal with him [Trump]. Only the private bank is willing to accept personal guarantees.\u201d In the years since then, Deutsche Bank has been hit by scandal after scandal. It was fined more than $630m for failing to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering \u2013 and has paid $7.2bn to settle a decade-old bond mis-selling scandal. No wonder, then, that the bank that likes to say yes to Donald Trump thought it best to have a proper review of its arrangements with him following his unexpected win in the US presidential election. Deutsche has carried out a close internal examination into its lending to the president. The aim: to see if there were suspicious and potentially embarrassing connections to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. The review began last year, when Trump became a politically exposed person (PEP). In recent weeks Deutsche has fielded numerous calls from the media on a possible financial trail to Moscow. The examination failed to find any evidence of this, according to a person familiar with the matter. Deutsche\u2019s links to Russia have been under the spotlight since a money laundering scheme was exposed last summer by the New Yorker magazine. The \u201cmirror trades\u201d scandal saw Deutsche brokers in Moscow buy stocks in roubles on behalf of a Russian company. Simultaneously another firm, registered offshore, would sell the same amount of stock in dollars, pounds or euros. The scam allowed the bank\u2019s Russian clients to turn money in roubles, much of it dubious, into dollars abroad. The scheme\u2019s alleged mastermind was Tim Wiswell, an American trader subsequently fired by Deutsche. According to an FCA report Wiswell, who was head of the Russian equities desk in Moscow, received about $3.8m in bribes via his girlfriend. These were paid into offshore accounts in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands. Deutsche has not identified the Russian customers who used the scheme. Wiswell\u2019s lawyer, Ekaterina Dukhina, refused to comment. Under its former CEO, Josef Ackermann, Deutsche Bank developed close connections with the Russian state. In 2006 Deutsche\u2019s Moscow branch hired Andrei Kostyn, the son of Andrey Kostyn, the head of VTB, Russia\u2019s state bank. Kostyn Jr generated much of the bank\u2019s Moscow profits until his death in 2011 in a snowmobile crash. Deutsche carried out an internal investigation into the \u201cmirror trades\u201d scandal codenamed Project Square. The bank scaled down its Moscow activities and transferred some clients to VTB. To what extent \u2013 if any \u2013 was Deutsche\u2019s Moscow operation compromised? Did the clients have Kremlin connections? We don\u2019t know. Meanwhile, Democrats are piling on the pressure. Joe Crowley, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s web of global financial entanglements are of serious concern. When a foreign-owned bank that is under investigation by the Department of Justice holds hundreds of millions in personally-guaranteed debt for the president, that is problematic for ethical, diplomatic, and judicial reasons. This is why we must know more about all of Donald Trump\u2019s business ties.\u201d Crowley also said he wanted the president to release his elusive tax returns. Deutsche has not explained why it continued to bankroll Trump and his real estate deals. Even before the 2008 legal dispute, Trump\u2019s chequered business record was infamous. Other financial houses in New York refused to give him credit, following a string of failed ventures including an airline and a casino empire in Atlantic City. Bloomberg reported that Deutsche was now trying to restructure Trump\u2019s $300m debt, which is guaranteed by four of his properties. The difficulty is obvious: conflict of interest. The president owes the bank money. At the same time the Trump administration and its Department of Justice is investigating Deutsche over its Russian money laundering scheme. Trump remains the bank\u2019s most high-profile client. He is also, increasingly, its biggest PR headache. Additional reporting by David Pegg",

Three-and-a-half years earlier the bank had loaned Trump the cash to build one of his grandest projects yet: a hotel and mega-tower in Chicago. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/16/deutsche-bank-examined-trump-account-for-russia-links\">Deutsche Bank examined Trump's account for Russia links</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump had given his personal guarantee he would repay the $640m. As per agreement, he was now due to hand over a large chunk, $40m. </p> <p>There was only one problem: the future 45th president of the United States was refusing to pay up. Deutsche initiated legal action. Trump responded with a blistering, scarcely credible writ of his own, a 10-count complaint in New York\u2019s supreme court, in the county of Queens. </p> <p>In it, Trump adopted a highly unusual defence, known as \u201cforce majeure\u201d. He claimed that the 2008 economic crisis was a \u201conce-in-a-century credit tsunami\u201d, an act of God that was equivalent to an earthquake.</p> <p>Since it couldn\u2019t have been anticipated, and it wasn\u2019t his fault, he wasn\u2019t obliged to pay Deutsche anything. It wouldn\u2019t get the $40m or the outstanding $330m, his writ said. <br></p> <p>He went further. Trump claimed Deutsche Bank had actually helped cause the crunch. Therefore it owed <em>him</em>. Trump demanded $3bn from Deutsche in compensation.</p> <p>Its New York property division first loaned money to him in 1998 at a time when the bank was attempting to expand its commercial real estate portfolio. By that stage, other major banks were becoming cautious about Trump, in part, the Wall Street Journal has said, because of frustration with his business practices.</p> <p>A decade later, Deutsche was to find out for itself quite how capricious and unpredictable he could be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/12/not-draining-swamp-trump-money-mens-best-friend\">Instead of draining the swamp, Trump has become Wall Street\u2019s best buddy | Will Hutton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the 2008 suit the bank\u2019s unhappy lawyers quote from Trump\u2019s book Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and in Life<em>.</em> On his struggle with banks in the 1990s, Trump writes: \u201cI figured it was the banks\u2019 problem, not mine.

He was willing to spend it on his latest project: a golf course and hotel near Balmedie in Aberdeenshire. Controversially approved by then first minister Alex Salmond and the Scottish government, it would be the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest golf course\u201d, Trump said.</p> <p>It was what happened next that strikes many in the banking world as unusual \u2013 bizarre, even. In 2005 Trump had borrowed money from Deutsche\u2019s commercial real estate division. In 2010 the parties settled their legal differences.</p> <p>But rather than walking away, the bank\u2019s private wealth division then resumed lending to Trump, the troublesome four-times bankrupt client who had defaulted on a major loan.</p> <p>Why?

It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/31/deutsche-bank-fined-630m-over-russia-money-laundering-claims\">fined more than $630m for failing to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering</a> \u2013 and has paid $7.2bn to settle a decade-old bond mis-selling scandal.</p> <p>No wonder, then, that the bank that likes to say yes to Donald Trump thought it best to have a proper review of its arrangements with him following his unexpected win in the US presidential election.</p> <p>Deutsche has carried out a close internal examination into its lending to the president. The aim: to see if there were suspicious and potentially embarrassing connections to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. </p> <p>The review began last year, when Trump became a politically exposed person (PEP). In recent weeks Deutsche has fielded numerous calls from the media on a possible financial trail to Moscow.</p> <p>The examination failed to find any evidence of this, according to a person familiar with the matter. Deutsche\u2019s links to Russia have been under the spotlight since a money laundering scheme was <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/deutsche-banks-10-billion-scandal\">exposed last summer by the New Yorker magazine</a>. </p> <p>The \u201cmirror trades\u201d scandal saw Deutsche brokers in Moscow buy stocks in roubles on behalf of a Russian company. Simultaneously another firm, registered offshore, would sell the same amount of stock in dollars, pounds or euros. The scam allowed the bank\u2019s Russian clients to turn money in roubles, much of it dubious, into dollars abroad.</p> <p>The scheme\u2019s alleged mastermind was Tim Wiswell, an American trader subsequently fired by Deutsche. According to an FCA report Wiswell, who was head of the Russian equities desk in Moscow, received about $3.8m in bribes via his girlfriend. These were paid into offshore accounts in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands.</p> <p>Deutsche has not identified the Russian customers who used the scheme. Wiswell\u2019s lawyer, Ekaterina Dukhina, refused to comment.<br><br>Under its former CEO, Josef Ackermann, Deutsche Bank developed close connections with the Russian state. In 2006 Deutsche\u2019s Moscow branch hired Andrei Kostyn, the son of Andrey Kostyn, the head of VTB, Russia\u2019s state bank. Kostyn Jr generated much of the bank\u2019s Moscow profits until his death in 2011 in a snowmobile crash. Deutsche carried out an internal investigation into the \u201cmirror trades\u201d scandal codenamed Project Square. The bank scaled down its Moscow activities and transferred some clients to VTB.</p> <p>To what extent \u2013 if any \u2013 was Deutsche\u2019s Moscow operation compromised? Did the clients have Kremlin connections? We don\u2019t know.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, Democrats are piling on the pressure.</p> <p>Joe Crowley, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s web of global financial entanglements are of serious concern. When a foreign-owned bank that is under investigation by the Department of Justice holds hundreds of millions in personally-guaranteed debt for the president, that is problematic for ethical, diplomatic, and judicial reasons. This is why we must know more about all of Donald Trump\u2019s business ties.\u201d</p> <p>Crowley also said he wanted the president to release his elusive tax returns.</p> <p>Deutsche has not explained why it continued to bankroll Trump and his real estate deals. Even before the 2008 legal dispute, Trump\u2019s chequered business record was infamous. Other financial houses in New York refused to give him credit, following a string of failed ventures including an airline and a casino empire in Atlantic City.<br></p> <p>Bloomberg reported that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-22/deutsche-bank-s-reworking-a-big-trump-loan-as-inauguration-nears\">Deutsche was now trying to restructure Trump\u2019s $300m debt, which is guaranteed by four of his properties. </a>The difficulty is obvious: conflict of interest. The president owes the bank money. At the same time the Trump administration and its Department of Justice is investigating Deutsche over its Russian money laundering scheme. <br></p> <p>Trump remains the bank\u2019s most high-profile client. He is also, increasingly, its biggest PR headache.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by David Pegg</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Britons are spending less on booze, smoking and drugs and more on eating out and hotels according to the latest snapshot of family spending. Weekly spending on alcohol, tobacco and narcotics fell below \u00a312 for the first time since comparable records began in 2001-02, partly reflecting the decline in the number of people who smoke. Spending in this category has fallen by a third over the last decade according to the Office for National Statistics. On the other hand, households spent more than \u00a345 a week on restaurants and hotels for the first time in five years in the year ending March 2016, fuelled by rising disposable income and high rates of employment. Average total spending \u2013 adjusted for inflation \u2013 was unchanged from a year earlier at about \u00a3529 a week, possibly reflecting weaker consumer confidence over the period, according to the ONS. Low income families continued to spend a higher proportion of their spending on food and energy compared with people on higher incomes. Weekly spending was highest in London, at \u00a3652.40, while at the the other end of the scale, spending in the north-east was more than \u00a3200 lower, at \u00a3423.50. The ONS reported that the discrepancy was down to housing costs. Toby Clark, director of research for Europe at Mintel, the market-research company, said the figures reflected a combination of people being more health conscious and shunning \u201cstuff\u201d in favour of experiences. \u201cThere is a limit to the amount of stuff people can accumulate. People are spending money on experiences \u2013 holidays, seeing new exotic places, going to music festivals, eating out \u2013 rather than accumulating more things.\u201d The ONS asked 5,000 households to keep a diary of spending over a two-week period, offering an insight into the latest spending habits. Jacob Kenedy, the chef and restaurateur behind London Bocca di Lupo, Vico, and Gelupo in central London, said eating out was becoming a way of life in Britain. \u201cWe have one of the best restaurant scenes in London and that is helping to drive our cuisine nationally. Eating out is becoming part of life, it\u2019s not just for special occasions. If we are able to invest more of our income into living well \u2013 whether that be living more healthily or enjoying life more \u2013 then it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d A breakdown of what people spend showed that the UK was a nation hooked on sugar, with the average household spending more every week on cakes and biscuits than it does on bread. Whole milk is out of favour, with households spending 40p a week on the full fat version compared with \u00a31.40 on low fat milk. Technology has vastly changed what people spend money on over the past 20 years. The proportion of households that owned a mobile phone has jumped from 16% in 1997 to 95% in the year ending March 2016. \u201cTo put this into context, 95% of UK households also have central heating, suggesting that communication devices such as mobile phones are now viewed as a necessity,\u201d according to the ONS. In a further sign of changing technology, nothing was spent on answering machines or fax machines according to households\u2019 spending diaries. The ONS stressed, however, that UK households still spend money on more traditional pastimes, including 70p a week on the cinema and \u00a34.60 on pets. Jo Bulman, ONS statistician, said: \u201cWhile overall household spending didn\u2019t change much in real terms since the previous year, we did see some interesting shifts in the types of things people are spending their money on.\u201d The report showed that households have still not fully recovered from the blow dealt by the financial crisis, with family spending still below 2007 levels. Spending habits change according to income levels, with the lowest income households having less to spend on non-essential items such as eating out. The Equality Trust said that the richest 10% spend more on wine every week, at \u00a39, than the poorest 10% spend on their water bills, at \u00a37.30. Wanda Wyporska, executive director at the trust, said there were often misconceptions about how lower income families spend their money, and that many people were working, budgeting and making difficult choices about which necessities to go without. \u201cThere\u2019s a gargantuan gap in spending between the richest and poorest households because there is such huge inequality in our society. We often hear the poor criticised for being wasteful, that\u2019s a hard argument to make when the richest are spending more on their pets than the poorest are on clothing their families. \u201cWe know millions more are in danger of falling into debt and poverty. It\u2019s about time the government addressed the urgent need to reduce inequality and poverty, and support those who are clearly in dire need.\u201d Overall, transport was the single biggest weekly cost for households, averaging at \u00a372.70 or 14% of total spending. It was closely followed by housing \u2013 excluding mortgage interest payments and council tax but including rent \u2013 fuel and power at \u00a372.50 a week. Among renters, the average weekly spend on rent was \u00a392, rising to \u00a3167.10 in London. The average weekly mortgage payment was \u00a3147.60 Average weekly family spending in the year ending March 2016 Transport: \u00a372.70 Housing*, fuel and power: \u00a372.50 Recreation and culture: \u00a368 Food and non-alcoholic drinks: 56.80 Restaurants and hotels: \u00a345.10 Miscellaneous goods and services: \u00a339.70 Household goods and services: \u00a335.50 Clothing and footwear: \u00a323.50 Communication: \u00a316 Alcoholic drinks, tobacco and narcotics: \u00a311.40 Health: \u00a37.20 Education: \u00a37 Other items: \u00a373.60 *Excluding mortgage interest payments and council tax but includes rent.",

      "bodyText": "Company bosses have been warned that excessive pay deals damage the reputation of big businesses and put them in the firing line for a showdown with shareholders and a raft of new regulations. In a series of submissions to the government\u2019s consultation on corporate reform, shareholders and lobby groups spell out the risks to big business of failing to keep a lid on executive pay which has risen by one-third since 2010. Stephen Martin, the new director general of the Institute of Directors, said executive pay is a risk to the reputation of business and that this year\u2019s AGM season \u2013 when shareholders are able to vote on executive pay \u2013 is a big test for the boards of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies. \u201cIf boards don\u2019t get out in front of shareholder and public anger, they will only push politicians closer to regulating,\u201d said Martin. Peter Cheese, who runs the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), said: \u201cCurrent levels of executive pay undermine both trust and sustainability.\u201d While Stefan Stern, head of the High Pay Centre, warned that the gap between chief executive pay and that of the workforce would keep widening unless there was radical reform. Bosses of of FTSE 100 companies are currently paid around 147 times the average wage of employees. \u201cIf CEO pay continues to increase at the same rate as it has done for the last 20 years, over the next two decades we could be seeing average CEO-to-average pay ratios of over 400:1 and certainly over 300:1, which is the level of pay ratio that is frequently seen in large US corporates,\u201d said Stern, who is calling for companies to be required to publish their pay ratios. There have already been shareholder rebellions over pay this year, including at Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and John Player cigarettes which had to abandon a pay rise for its chief executive Alison Cooper. Travel company Thomas Cook also cut the pay for its boss Peter Fankhauser after a protest vote at its AGM. The IoD doubts the viability of putting workers on boards \u2013 initially raised by Theresa May as part of her pledges to reform corporate Britain \u2013 but calls for reforms to executive pay deals. About 37% of its members who responded to a survey thought that forcing companies to appoint an employee representative to the board would would diminish the quality of corporate governance. Long-term incentive plans used by companies to award shares to directors on the basis of three-year performance, should be overhauled and pay deals spread out over 10 years, the IoD\u2019s new director Martin said. \u201cSimplifying executive pay schemes, which are often unnecessarily complex, and extending payouts over longer periods would both help to restore confidence that remuneration is truly linked to performance,\u201d he added. How private firms are run has also been in the spotlight following the collapse of BHS. The green paper asked if private firms should be subjected to some rules faced by companies listed on the stock market. The IoD said that while the governance of private companies is a \u201cmystery\u201d, adhering to the corporate governance code would be too onerous. Instead it suggests a code for private firms which are less prescriptive than the one for listed corporations. The Financial Reporting Council, which polices the corporate governance codes for listed companies, is asking for new powers to rein in boardroom bosses. It is is currently only able to fine and ban individuals who are members of professional bodies but does not have powers to sanction boardroom directors who are not and wants to to be able to do so. The council also intends to undertake a \u201cfundamental review\u201d of the corporate governance code. It will publish a consultation in the summer.",

The Guardian has been made aware of NHBC, the regulator of new homes, issuing gagging orders or so-called non-disclosure agreement that not only restrict the homeowner from contacting the media about the problems with their property but also talking to neighbours in the development. The gagging orders raise further questions about NHBC, which provides warranties for most new-build properties. Critics of the organisation claim it is failing to protect consumers amid a wave of complaints about the quality of new-build properties. An industry source who advises new home buyers in the south of England said one family they were working with had received an offer from NHBC to buy back their troublesome new home and pay their removal costs as long as they did not disclose the agreement. The source said of other clients: \u201cPeople tell me they have problems [with their new home] but then they go quiet.\u201d The NHBC warranty \u2013 which is called Buildmark \u2013 is a form of insurance to compensate home buyers or fix faults in the new property if there are problems within the first 10 years. Paula Higgins, chief executive of the Homeowners Alliance, said: \u201cGagging orders are unfair. NHBC are acting as if they have something to hide. As guardians of quality of new homes in Britain they should operate openly and transparently rather than resorting to desperate measures. \u201cSilencing those who have a reason to complain will make it more likely to push down standards in the industry rather than pushing them up.\u201d An NHBC spokesperson said it included a confidentiality clause in a \u201csmall number of rare circumstances\u201d, but declined to disclose the number. They said: \u201cBuildmark is an insurance product. Claims made are settled either by NHBC arranging for repairs to be carried out, or paying the homeowner the cost of doing so. \u201cWhen we make a payment, we ask the homeowner to sign a letter to acknowledge that the payment settles their claim. These letters do not include confidentially or non-disclosure clauses. \u201cOnly in a small number of rare circumstances will we include a confidentiality clause on settling a claim. In line with standard practice in the insurance industry, and to protect commercial confidentiality, this would be in specific cases that are subject to a formal legal agreement or when NHBC has agreed to meet the costs of a claim over and above the Buildmark policy requirements.\u201d",

David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, insisted that the vast majority of business will see no change or a fall in their rates, while a quarter will see their bills rise. His robust defence of the revaluation is likely to dampen speculation that the move could be reversed in Philip Hammond\u2019s budget next month. The government is facing mounting calls for a rethink after warnings from some shops and other businesses, particularly in London, about the crippling effect of the revaluation which comes into force in April. New rates will be set by the Valuation Office Agency in the coming weeks, and rates are set to rise unusually sharply in areas where property prices have increased sharply. The increase in business rates from April is the result of a new revaluation of the rental value of property in Britain. This is supposed to take place every five years but the previous revaluation was controversially delayed by the government for two years, making the change in bills from April more pronounced. London will be particularly affected because the rental value of property in prime areas has increased substantially since the financial crisis. But Gauke said: \u201cFar from the picture painted by scaremongering ratings agents, nearly three quarters of businesses will actually see no change, or even a fall, in their business rates bills. \u201cThe fact is that the generous reliefs we are introducing mean that 600,000 small businesses are paying no business rates at all \u2013 something we\u2019re making permanent so they never pay these bills again. \u201cWhether on a town\u2019s high street or in a rural community, we\u2019ve also introduced \u00a33.6bn in support for companies affected by the business rates revaluation \u2013 a process that is making the system accurate and fair for everyone.\u201d Thousands of firms are expecting changes to their tax bills as a result of the revaluation, although the government says transitional arrangements will be in place to help businesses cope with their new rates. On Wednesday, the Institute of Directors (IoD) urged Hammond to tackle anomalies in the tax system that see high street shops pay higher rates on small premises than online giants do for vast warehouses. It said the chancellor should use next month\u2019s budget to set up a New Economy Tax Commission to make the system fit for the modern age of internet shopping and the \u201cplatform economy\u201d. With many small shops and pubs bracing themselves for sharp rises in their tax bills due to business rate revaluations this year, the IoD called for further relief for businesses based in properties worth up to \u00a3100,000.",

      "bodyText": "Waitrose, Iceland and Marks &amp; Spencer have bagged the top slots in a supermarket survey based on customers\u2019 levels of satisfaction when shopping in store and online. The upmarket grocer topped the \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d table in the annual poll by consumer group Which? for the third year in a row, narrowly beating M&amp;S. Iceland\u2019s home delivery service came top for the second successive year after receiving the highest, five-star customer score. Which? said Waitrose\u2019s high levels of customer service had won over shoppers. It was the only chain to get five stars for staff availability and helpfulness, boosted by parent company the John Lewis Partnership\u2019s bonus scheme whereby all employees share in the profits. Waitrose and M&amp;S won plaudits from shoppers for their store appearance and quality of own-label and fresh products. M&amp;S\u2019s \u201cDine In\u201d offers \u2013 a meal for two for \u00a310 including a bottle of wine \u2013 also scored highly. Which? asked more than 7,000 shoppers to rate stores where they had shopped in the previous six months based on factors including appearance, length of queues, ease of finding products and overall quality of fresh foods. For the online ranking, shoppers were asked about relevance of substitutions for products, value for money and delivery service. The consumer group also asked more than 4,700 people about their experience of using convenience stores, with M&amp;S Simply Food stores coming top and stalwarts Budgens, Nisa and Spar at the bottom. \u201cWith concerns over rising prices, the competition among supermarkets is fiercer than ever,\u201d said Richard Headland, Which? magazine editor. \u201cWhile value for money remains a top priority, in-store appearance and the availability of quality and fresh products can also go a long way to satisfying shoppers\u2019 needs.\u201d In the online category, Iceland came top for the second consecutive year, with customers happy with its no substitution policy, convenient delivery slots and friendly drivers. That came despite having just a 2.2% share of the UK supermarket business (according to recent Kantar figures), yet with 17.5% of the frozen food market, second only to Tesco. In store, Iceland attracts a middling rating of 69%, losing points with customers for the quality of its fresh products and store tidiness and appearance. But its own-label products were praised, with a clear thumbs-up for its new luxury lines, which include sourdough bread, lobster and sea bass. Iceland\u2019s joint managing director, Nick Canning, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have our online offering recognised as industry leading in this highly respected Which? survey. It feels like people are finally opening up their eyes to the quality we deliver, and we have much more innovation planned for the year ahead.\u201d Ocado, the internet-only grocery delivery company, took second spot ahead of other online competitors including Morrisons, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose. German discounters Aldi and Lidl (in store only) shared third place and are the only two supermarkets in the survey to be awarded top marks for value for money. Of the other large supermarkets, Asda came last below Tesco (eighth) and Sainsbury\u2019s (seventh), which were ranked lower due to the unavailability of many popular products, difficulty finding items and lack of value for money. Asda came bottom of the in-store table and joint last in the online rankings. The grocer is seen as generally good value but with only average food quality. \u201cWe know that we need to do a better job for our customers and our colleagues are working hard to make a real difference\u201d said an Asda spokesperson.
