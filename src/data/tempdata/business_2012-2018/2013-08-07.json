    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The ground floor of an empty life insurance office in Croydon seems an unlikely setting for the first of what could be a new chain of food stores, but it is here that easyJet billionaire Stelios Haji-Ioannou is planning to test his latest venture \u2013 a super-cheap grocery outlet to be branded easyFoodstore. Haji-Ioannou has bought the freehold to the old MetLife office block opposite East Croydon station. It will house various existing easy-branded ventures: the top floors will be an easyHotel, the middle floors will offer short-term office space and perhaps a gym. But the ground floor is reserved for the first branch of his ultra-budget grocery store, to open this autumn. If it succeeds, the entrepreneur could turn it into a national chain. The aim is to sell basic grocery items, such as tinnned and dried food and washing powder, at rock-bottom prices: lower even than the so-called hard discounters Aldi and Lidl that have thrived in hard-times Britain. News of the venture leaked out earlier than Haji-Ioannou wanted and so, he said, he can only give a broad outline of what the business will be like. There will be 50 to 100 items on the shelves, with no fresh or frozen food apart from, possibly, bread and eggs. He is not going into partnership with a big retailer and he does not claim any great innovation. He will source non-branded goods from wholesalers. \"There is no business plan. I don't know what the shop will look like. If you ask me to rank the risks, the biggest is that nobody turns up. It's a freehold property so I can afford to experiment for a year or longer,\" he said on the phone from Monaco. Haji-Ioannou said the idea came from two sources: his Food from the Heart project in Cyprus and the growth of food banks in the UK. Food from the Heart hands out cheese and salami sandwiches to Cyprus's needy people at lunchtime. The pilot site in Limassol has given out more than 7,800 snacks in a month. Haji-Ioannou plans to extend it to more sites on the bailed-out island. \"In simple terms, I realised that food is the most fundamental need for a person. In difficult economic times, people's priorities change and they might be willing to do something that secures for them the lowest possible weekly food bill.\" EasyFoodstore will be a kind of non-convenience store. It will open, he says, maybe six hours a day, five days a week, to keep costs and prices down. \"Food from the Heart is open two hours a day, five days a week but that hasn't made it unpopular. Are people saying 'I'm not coming back because I've had enough halloumi'? We haven't had any evidence that is how they think.\" But easyFoodstore will not be a charitable venture. The billionaire thinks he can make money while providing cheaper food. \"There is a place and a time for philanthropy and there is only so much money you can give away. If you are going to make it more scalable than that you have to find a commercial formula.\" Croydon is not one of London's poorest boroughs but it has pockets of extreme poverty and its town centre has boarded-up shops, a branch of pawnbroker Albermarle &amp; Bond and other signs of austerity UK. Less than a mile from Haji-Ioannou's building, on an industrial estate, is Croydon's own food bank, in the Praise Baptist church. Grace Saah, the church's administrator, said: \"You don't have to go far in Croydon to see what is going on. There is a lot of homelessness, people begging for money and you see a lot of single-parent families. With changes in benefits, many people are suffering.\" At a busy lunchtime session, people pick up food donated by the public, sometimes just for themselves and sometimes for their family. Will easyFoodstore fill a gap in the market for people struggling in Croydon? \"Yes and no,\" said Saah. \"Those that come to us don't have a great deal but there are people who slip through the net because of pride and things like that, and they will take whatever they can.\" Adam Phillips is 18 and has filled his backpack with cereal, frankfurters, tinned fruit and other staples from the food bank. He is there because his benefit has been cut off temporarily. When he has money, he shops at Asda, Poundland and 99p stores. Phillips said the idea of EasyFoodstore sounded \"good \u2013 because I'm always looking for cheaper places to go\". But he pointed out that the supermarkets have their budget ranges. \"How cheap is he going to sell it?\" Bill Grimsey, a veteran retailer, thinks Stelios will struggle: \"Stelios's formula when he went into the airline business worked extremely well because none of the big boys had anything to compare with it or the competency to do it. But that competency exists at Aldi, Lidl and in a specialised form at Iceland. Where do you get the buying strength from to get prices down? The barriers are huge and I don't think he's going to make it.\" Haji-Ioannou argues his ability to buy property gives him a key advantage. He already holds the cheaply bought freehold of the Croydon building so the shop does not need to be that profitable to give him a healthy return. \"One of the reasons I'm interested in retail is because it's the only sector in the UK that is depressed. Retail shops are empty and there must be bargains in retail property.\" Chris Mould, chief executive of the Trussell Trust, which sets up and backs food banks nationally, argues that basic food could be cheaper in Britain. He cites Uswitch figures from 2011 that showed the UK was the most expensive country in Europe for a basket of staples. \"What that tells us is that there is room for something to happen. We want to see the industry in general do everything it can to provide nutritionally balanced food at lower prices.\" For Haji-Ioannou, easyFoodstore is a hunch that may or may not pay off \u2013 another in a line of ventures he has tried since making his fortune with easyJet. \"Luckily I have enough resources so I can do a simple experiment like this. If we don't make a lot of money, but we help people put food on the table, that is fine.\"",

    "webTitle": "Interest rates to remain low until well after 2015 election, says Carney", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The new governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has signalled that Britain's ultra-low interest rates would remain unchanged until well after the 2015 general election as he stressed that only a big fall in unemployment would bring an end to the cheap money of the past four years. In a move welcomed by George Osborne as likely to support the UK recovery from its deepest recession in recent history, Carney said he would wait until the jobless rate lowered to 7% before considering whether to push up the cost of borrowing. The governor said the Bank would only think again about its pro-growth stance if there was a threat of higher inflation or asset bubbles, but the City said the chances of the government's election plans being disrupted by a tightening of monetary policy were remote. Carney said there was \"understandable relief\" that the economy had started to grow again and that the Bank's monetary policy committee wanted to reassure households and businesses that there would be no early increase in interest rates from their record low of 0.5%, or any unwinding of the \u00a3375bn stimulus provided by the quantitative easing programme. \"There are clear signs that economic activity has strengthened this year,\" Carney said. \"But there should be little satisfaction. Much is at stake as we seek to secure this recovery and return inflation to target.\" The unemployment rate \u2013 currently 7.8% \u2013 was the biggest sign that the UK still needs help, Carney said. \"Until the margin of slack within the economy has narrowed significantly, it will be appropriate to maintain the current exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy.\" He added that to hit the 7% threshold for unemployment, the economy would need to create 750,000 new jobs. The Bank thinks this is unlikely before 2016. Osborne is confident that the aggressive action by the Bank will offset the impact of his austerity measures and ensure that the economy is growing steadily by the time of the election in the spring of 2015. Weak growth in wages and below-inflation increases in benefits are seen as threats to consumer spending this year. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, welcomed the so-called \"forward guidance\" from the Bank but said Osborne also needed to act to support the economy. \"By recognising the importance of policy action to support jobs and growth, at last we are seeing the governor show the leadership we have failed to see over the last three years and are still not seeing from the chancellor. Mark Carney is right to warn that the recovery is weak. It is the slowest on record and families are facing a growing cost of living crisis. \"But the new governor is not a miracle worker and monetary policy cannot do the job alone. As we and the International Monetary Fund have consistently said George Osborne must finally act to support the economy and also help families feeling the squeeze.\" Carney insisted that the Bank had not abandoned its commitment to low inflation and said there were three circumstances in which it would re-think its pledge to keep policy loose. These were a forecast that the annual increase in the cost of living would be more than 2.5% 18-24 months in the future; signs that the public was beginning to take higher inflation for granted; and a risk of rapidly rising asset prices that could not be tackled other than by raising the cost of borrowing. Carney said that the Bank's guidance would cease to apply if any of these \"knockout clauses\" were triggered, and this helped the pound to weather an initial sell-off and end the day a cent higher against the US dollar at $1.55. Before the announcement, dealers felt a rate rise was unlikely until late 2015 but some now believe an earlier tightening of policy is possible. The FTSE 100 Index closed at its lowest level in a month, dropping 93 points to 6511. The industry welcomed the Bank's decision. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: \"Today's announcement shows that the Bank understands a real recovery is something that benefits ordinary people, and not just an upward blip in economists' outlooks.\" John Allan, national chairman, Federation of Small Businesses, hailed \"a profound shift in monetary policy\" and added: \"We welcome this bold and imaginative thinking to secure the recovery. In the longer term, we hope it will give investors and firms looking to grow confidence to bring forward work which will in turn help increase employment.\" Peter Spencer, economic adviser to the Ernst &amp; Young ITEM club, said: \"The hype surrounding Mark Carney did not go in vain as he managed to deliver on high expectations of shaking up the UK's monetary policy approach. The economy is in recovery rather than remission and this guidance gives the Bank the flexibility to reduce the risk of relapse.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A consortium backed by the Church of England to bid for 315 Royal Bank of Scotland branches has lined up the ex-United Utilities boss Philip Green to front its bid. Green is to replace John Tiner, the former Financial Services Authority chief executive who stepped down as chairman in the wake of the controversy caused by the parliamentary commission on banking standards investigation into HBOS. Green is to chair the bid vehicle \u2013 one of three that have submitted bids for the RBS branches this week \u2013 working alongside former Lloyds Banking Group banker John Maltby who has been lined up as chief executive. The vehicle is backed by Corsair Capital \u2013 the private equity group fronted in the UK by former trade minister and banker Lord Davies, Centerbridge, another private equity company, Standard Life investments, a Rothschild investment fund and the Church Commissioners, who manage \u00a35.5bn of investments to support the Church of England. The other two bidders are a consortium fronted by former Tesco finance director Andrew Higginson and one led by former HSBC banker Alan Hughes and backed by private equity firms AnaCap and Blackstone. RBS could reject all the offers and proceed with a stock market flotation. The bidders are expected to revive the Williams &amp; Glyn's brand that disappeared from high streets in 1986 and is being recreated by RBS to facilitate the sale, which was demanded by the European commission as a condition for approving the \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds pumped into RBS during the banking crisis. Green, who was only briefly a non-executive director of Lloyds Banking Group, said he had agreed to chair the vehicle because there was a \"real market opportunity. There are a lot of people working in the industry \u2026 who are weary of saying to people, almost ashamed to say, that they are bankers. We want to reverse that and \u2026 [want them to be able to] walk into a pub and talk to their mates and say we work for Williams &amp; Glyn's, we're proud of it,\" said Green. The bid is expected to be bound by pay policies followed by the church, led by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury. The church has said it will vote down pay proposals granting bosses more than 100% of their salary in bonuses. Welby sat on the parliamentary commission on banking standards and has called for the introduction of regional banks. Maltby said the consortium would turn Williams &amp; Glyn's into a local community bank with transparent pricing and a business model based on making profits on the difference between interest rates charged for loans and paid on savings. He said the consortium agreed with the church's view on pay. \"We will be successful in attracting some great talent,\" he added. A Church Commissioners spokesperson said: \"Our ethical investment advisory group policy, which the consortium has signed up to, is about executive directors and we would expect the tone to be set from the top. But clearly these are early days and the details will be worked out if the bid is successful.\" The value of the bid is not clear but it is likely to be around \u00a3600m, which would be ploughed into the branches ahead of a stock market flotation, which may not be possible before 2015. RBS had originally hoped to sell the branches to Santander but that deal fell through in October 2012 and the 81% taxpayer-owned bank will now require approval from Brussels for an extension of its November 2013 deadline for the disposal. At last week's results, the outgoing RBS finance director Bruce van Saun said a fully operational bank was unlikely to be ready until 2015. He said RBS had been looking for investors for the branches ahead of the separation and before a stock market flotation. Van Saun said: \"We will, kind of, see cards up, maybe some time next week, where we consider whether that makes sense for us to do that or not.\" At a time when the government is keen to encourage competition on the high street, especially for small business lending, Maltby said: \"We've got all the benefits of being a challenger bank with all the room to grow and all the agility to do that. It's not about having to compete on the best-buy tables all the time. We'll be competitive but it will be about helping customers do what they want to.\"",

Meanwhile, net sales rose 8% to 467.51bn rupees. Analysts had been expecting on average a net profit of 22.34bn rupees, according to data from Thomson Reuters.",

      "bodyText": "He knew it would be a tough job when he took it on last year, but Francis Egan, chief executive of fracking firm Cuadrilla Resources, could not have imagined the role would bring with it death threats and reporters turning up at his house trying to \"frack\" his garden. Environmentalists have been campaigning against fracking for years, but Egan's attempt to drill in the pretty West Sussex village of Balcombe has turned hydraulic fracturing (to give it is proper name) into a highly emotive subject that has galvanised opinions across the political and environmental spectrum and threatens to align some of the highest ranking members of the Tory party with a new generation of eco-warriors. Egan, 52, would like those debates to be about how fracking \u2013 pumping high pressure water and chemicals into deep wells to break up shale rock, releasing gas \u2013 will help secure the UK's energy future, increase the tax take and bring down gas bills. But an explosion of publicity against Cuadrilla's drilling in Balcombe \u2013 fanned by naked protesters, the \"frack off\" slogan and the arrest of Natalie Hynde \u2013 daughter of the Pretenders' Chrissie \u2013 has left the nation more concerned than ever about the risk of environmental damage and earthquakes. (Cuadrilla's test fracking was thought to cause a 2.3-magnitude earthquake near Blackpool.) Last week someone took the fight to the extreme by sending Egan an anonymous death threat, warning he would be sent pipe bombs unless the company stopped its activities. \"Fracking kills, and so do we,\" the email read. Writing in the Mail on Sunday last weekend, in an apparent attempt to address middle England directly, Egan was at pains to defend the Balcombe drilling. They are not fracking on the site, he said, but drilling a 6in diameter well looking for oil. There are 50 such wells in Sussex alone already, he said. \"If we don't find oil,\" he wrote, \"our work at Balcombe will come to an end.\" If Cuadrilla does find oil, one option is fracking. He addressed the \"scare stories\" about hydraulic fracturing. Drinking water might be polluted? \"No, it won't,\" he wrote. \"Not one confirmed case has come to light where fracking has contaminated an aquifer.\" That gas flaring can cause cancer? \"No, it doesn't,\" he said. What about fracking industrialising the countryside? \"No, it won't.\" Chancellor George Osborne is a fan of fracking and believes it would be a \"real tragedy\" if Britain let this potential \"energy revolution\" slip through its fingers. \"It would mean we would have much higher energy costs than other countries, it would mean jobs would go to other countries and we would lose out.\" Egan has explained: \"Developing our own huge shale gas resources, on the other hand, could generate billions in tax revenue and tens of thousands of jobs.\" Conservative backbenchers and more than a few cabinet ministers, however, may be concerned that they could lose their seats if widespread fracking gets the go-ahead. Research by Greenpeace shows 35 Tory MPs in the south have constituencies in areas that could be licensed for fracking. The public's fracking fears - largely inspired by horror stories from the US where the controversial technique accounts for more than a fifth of domestic gas production - even extend to worries that Cuadrilla might use the wells for toxic waste. \"We've heard everything,\" Egan said last year. \"From suggestions that Blackpool will sink beneath the waves to the idea that we will use the wells for nuclear waste.\" Egan, who in a previous job was once stranded in the desert between Tripoli and Benghazi, was recruited by Cuadrilla's chairman and significant financial backer, Lord Browne, last summer. His first task was to repair the company's public image, which had been more than a little shaken by the Blackpool earthquake, allegations that Cuadrilla staff trespassed into back gardens to survey for gas and a series of bruising public meetings. Less than a month after taking over, Egan was summoned to meet Charles Hendry, then the energy minister. Hendry told Egan and his team, including his predecessor Mark Miller (who is still with the company) and Lord Browne: \"Fracking has now turned into a very controversial issue. The issue of seismic tremors has contributed to this, but the situation has got worse because of recent reports of badly managed community meetings, reports of trespass on people's land. \"These incidents only served to strengthen what was now becoming a national campaign [against fracking],\" Asked how he would improve the public perception of the company, Egan, echoing Tony Blair's famous 1997 election pledge, replied: \"Communication, communication, communication.\" The residents of Balcombe \u2013 who voted 82% against the drilling despite Egan promising them \u00a3100,000 for every well fracked if it goes ahead \u2013 say he isn't talking enough, and certainly isn't listening to their concerns. Egan says the company has held several public meetings, and campaigner Louisa Delphy conceded that Egan did sit down and listen to her concerns for an hour at a recent drop-in session. Ken Cronin, a friend of Egan and chief executive of UK Onshore Operators Group (UKOOG), which represents the shale gas industry, says Egan \"tries his hardest to be cheerful\" while doing a \"very tough job, that I don't think everyone would want to do\". Egan, whose blood runs black and sticky after three decades in the oil industry at Marathon Oil and BHP Billiton, declined to speak to the Guardian for this article. His so-called crisis-PR representatives at Bell Pottinger, the corporate spinners famous for defending Trafigura over its dumping of toxic oil waste in the Ivory Coast, said he didn't have time and \"could really do with a holiday\". Campaigners say if they do get the chance to meet Egan, his Bell Pottinger minders \u2013 some of whom operate from behind a Cuadrilla, rather than Bell Pottinger email address \u2013 are always in attendance. Craig Bennett, director of policy and campaigns for Friends of the Earth, says Egan \"seems like a perfectly pleasant person to go and have a drink with\". But he adds: \"That's probably the image he wants to put across to us \u2026 There's always someone from Bell Pottinger with him.\" Bennett says the size of the backlash in Balcombe has \"absolutely shocked\" Egan. \"He's a man with a long history in the oil and gas industry. I've met a heck of a lot of people in oil and gas, they are so embedded in it they find it hard to understand why other people would have any problem with oil and gas. \"They talk about mitigating the impact on the environment, and have absolute faith they will be able to do it. He can make all the assurances he likes about mitigating the local impact, but the opposition will continue to grow.\" Egan is at pains not to lock horns with Bennett's organisation: \"It's hard to say you are opposed to Friends of the Earth,\" he said in another interview with the Daily Mail. \"I mean, even the name makes that hard. Who isn't a friend of the Earth?\" But Bennett says it was clear from the moment he met Egan that he's never going to give up. Neither are the campaigners or the people of Balcombe. \"There is going to be a fight,\" vows Bennett. The Bell Pottinger gatekeepers say Egan is making every attempt to calm nerves. \"Francis has regularly communicated with the local communities in both Lancashire and in Balcombe,\" they say. \"He has written them letters informing them what is happening as well as attending information days held for the local communities. Additionally Cuadrilla has a community line to assist in answering questions from the public. Francis is a good communicator.\" Except, apparently, when the tabloids turn up. Last week a Sunday People reporter arrived at Egan's Cheshire home in a digger and hard hat to cheekily ask to frack his garden (which is in an area of high shale concentration). Egan didn't answer the door, leaving Bell Pottinger to fire off an email instead: \"You appear to have pulled up outside Mr Egan's house with a digger,\" they wrote. \"We were wondering what exactly you are proposing to do.\" CV",

Interest rates are going to stay low for a very long time</h2> <p>Current predictions say the Bank will only consider raising rates in 2016, but it could be 2017 or 2018 before the economy is considered strong enough to cope with higher rates. It will not consider raising rates until unemployment declines to 7% (from 7.8%), and its own forecast puts unemployment above 7% in 2016.</p> <h2>2. The current economic recovery is fragile </h2> <p>The UK might have seen a 0.9% jump in GDP in the first six months of the year, but the Bank of England is concerned that growth remains weak. The level of GDP is below where it was in 2008 and well below where it would be if the crash hadn't happened. High unemployment shows there is slack in the economy that can be deployed without causing inflation.</p> <h2>3. Fears of a house price bubble are misplaced</h2> <p>Governor Mark Carney argued that the level of transactions are well below the peak (about a third lower) and house prices are still below the highest point in 2008, so a bubble is a long way off. And anyway, he said, the central bank now monitors the big lenders for dodgy or risky practices, so a repeat of the crazy lending in the first half of the last decade is unlikely.</p> <h2>4. Inflation is not a worry</h2> <p>This is not something the Bank of England has explicitly declared in its quarterly inflation report. It says monetary policy committee is still watching for any signs of inflation. However, there is little pressure from rising wages and it blames the current 2.9% rate (well above the 2% target) on the rising cost of train fares and regulated monopoly suppliers such as those related to water rates and gas prices.</p> <h2>5. More quantitative easing could be on the way</h2> <p>During the press conference held to announce the BoE's new forward guidance for interest rates, Carney made it clear the MPC plans to \"maintain the current highly stimulative stance of monetary policy\" and could even extend it. The Bank is unlikely to cut rates further, but could boost QE. It has pumped \u00a3375bn into the financial system to promote lending to little avail (it might have been even worse without it, said Carney's predecessor Lord King). Some analysts argue it should rise to \u00a3425bn.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Vodafone has set out its plans for the future of mobile internet, following in BT's footsteps by using top-flight football to lure customers to the 4G network it will launch at the end of August. In a sign that the worlds of telecoms and media are converging at a rapid rate, Vodafone is to become the latest phone company to use premium entertainment as a selling point after signing deals with Sky and online music library Spotify. Vodafone's hope is that instead of staring into space while queuing at the post office or riding on the bus, the eyes of its 4G customers will be firmly fixed on their smartphone screens, watching live football or downloading music from a selection of 20m tracks. \"Finally 4G has a purpose,\" said Guy Laurence, chief executive of Vodafone UK. \"It's all about entertainment.\" Vodafone's superfast network will go live on 29 August, the same date as rival O2, but 10 months after market leader EE. The debut will cover just London at first, then roll out to a further 12 cities before Christmas. The service will cost customers \u00a35 a month more on average than Vodafone's 3G packages, and allow smartphones to download data at six times the speed of the typical 3G service. Vodafone's superfast deals start at \u00a326 a month without a handset, for unlimited calls and texts and 2GB of data, or \u00a334 a month with a 4G-ready device plus unlimited calls and texts but just 500MB of data. While Sky is using broadband to lure customers to its pay-TV service, and BT is creating free sports channels to attract broadband customers, Vodafone is to give subscribers who sign up to its 4G service a choice of Sky Sports Mobile TV or Spotify's premium service free for the first six or 12 months, depending on the package. But the efforts of Vodafone and O2 to catch up with EE have been described as \"disappointing\". Vodafone, the UK's third biggest network, will expand its 4G service to Birmingham, Bradford, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield before the end of the year, but it will take until the end of 2015 to reach 98% of the population with a reliable indoor signal. O2, the number two competitor, will expand at a similar rate, partly because both brands are saving costs by sharing the masts in their 4G grid. EE, which owns the Orange and T-Mobile brands, launched its superfast network in 11 city centres at the end of last October, without having to wait for the government to free up additional spectrum. The 4G airwaves auction, at which Vodafone spent \u00a3802m acquiring more bandwidth, ended in February, and the firm was originally expected to bring its service to market in April or May. Kester Mann, an analyst at CCS Insight, said: \"The lack of urgency to launch reflects a low defection of customers to EE for which the majority of 4G sign-ups have been from its existing base. \"However, the slow pace of roll-out is disappointing for an operator that has always prided itself on the coverage and quality of its network.\" The 3G airwaves auction in 2000 was intended to bring mobile internet to the UK, but networks were slow to build the infrastructure needed to make smartphones work, and it was not until the arrival of Apple's iPhone in 2007 that the pace of investment picked up. Even today, only 77% of UK premises get a 3G signal from all four operators, while the geographic area covered by 3G from all four operators is just 20%. Laurence said: \"We need to build the cities out. That takes time. There's no shortage of engineers on the road. \"This whole period of mobile development is not going to be won or lost in one day.\" Vodafone's customers will have access to its new sports and music content from 12 August, ahead of its 4G network debut but in time for the first Barclays premier league fixtures on Saturday 17 August. Customers who choose the sports package will have live coverage of more than 100 Premier League games, the UEFA Champions League, the last Test in the current Ashes cricket series, as well as major golf, rugby and tennis contests. EE, which has used free films to market its 4G service, has already achieved a significant lead and expects to have well over a million customers by Christmas. Three, whose service will go live in the final three months of 2013, has promised its customers will have access to the higher speeds made possible by its 4G masts without having to pay extra. A Three spokesman said: \"We will offer 4G at no extra charge. When we switch on our 4G network well over a million of our customers will already have a 4G device, so they will get automatic and hassle-free access in 4G areas without the need to change plans or sim cards.\" Ernest Doku, telecoms expert at price comparison site uSwitch.com, said: \"At a time where many have been unconvinced by the virtue of superfast internet on their mobile, the pull of having access to millions of songs or all the goals in the palm of your hand as part of your monthly tariff might just be too good to pass up.\"",

      "body": "<p>Analysts react to the announcement by Bank of England governor Mark Carney that the bank will keep interest rates at a record low until unemployment falls to 7%.</p> <h2>James Knightley, UK ecnomist at ING</h2> <p>The Bank of England has chosen to implement forward guidance and have opted to go down the route selected by the Federal Reserve in linking interest rate rises to the unemployment rate ... Market reaction does seem somewhat cautious given the strong run of data and the fact that inflation is already at 2.9% and is likely to trend lower only fairly slowly. We also note that the unemployment rate can drop fairly quickly, as we have seen in the US. Indeed, the UK unemployment rate dropped from 7.8% to below 7% between December 1996 and September 1997 and did the same between February 1989 and December 1989.

      "bodyText": "Analysts react to the announcement by Bank of England governor Mark Carney that the bank will keep interest rates at a record low until unemployment falls to 7%. James Knightley, UK ecnomist at ING The Bank of England has chosen to implement forward guidance and have opted to go down the route selected by the Federal Reserve in linking interest rate rises to the unemployment rate ... Market reaction does seem somewhat cautious given the strong run of data and the fact that inflation is already at 2.9% and is likely to trend lower only fairly slowly. We also note that the unemployment rate can drop fairly quickly, as we have seen in the US. Indeed, the UK unemployment rate dropped from 7.8% to below 7% between December 1996 and September 1997 and did the same between February 1989 and December 1989. Therefore, like the economy in general, moves in the unemployment rate can gain momentum pretty quickly. Alternatively, there is also the risk that the stronger growth environment creates more jobs and this encourages more people who had withdrawn from the workforce to re-enter it. As the participation rate rises then this will make declines in the unemployment rate slower to materialise.

One of Spain's biggest white elephants, the airport at Ciudad Real in La Mancha, is up for auction: starting price \u20ac100m (\u00a386m), a steal, bearing in mind that it cost \u20ac1bn to build. The airport, 100 miles south of Madrid, is in mint condition as it has barely been used and boasts a runway long enough to land an Airbus 380, the world's largest airliner. The catch is paying off the outstanding \u20ac529m debt. Creditors include a variety of savings banks (\u20ac233m) Air Nostrum (\u20ac2.6m) and Air Berlin (\u20ac1.8m).

His first task as India\u2019s new central bank governor will be to avert the country\u2019s looming currency crisis.</p> <p>The Indian rupee is in free fall. It touched a record low against the dollar on Aug. 6...So how will Rajan avert a disaster? His stance is pro-growth, says a person who attended a meeting between him and private-sector economists four days before the RBI launched its growth-busting emergency measures. But in order to lower domestic interest rates at a time when US real rates are rising, Rajan will either need to introduce capital controls \u2013 as Malaysia did in 1998 \u2013 or win the confidence of global investors in India\u2019s growth revival plan. Rajan has strong credentials, and a winsome personality.

If timing is everything in politics, then the timing of Antonis Samaras\u2019 White House sit-down with president Barack Obama on Thursday could not be more prescient.</p> <p>Four years into Europe\u2019s worst economic crisis since the second world war, Greece, the nation where it all began, remains the front line state: the one EU member where it could all get better or all get worse. The US administration is not unsympathetic. From the outset, leading democrats have opposed the politics of austerity, with Obama at times almost pleading with Berlin to abandon its harsh fiscal policies in favour of development and growth. Obama, who has also defended the New Deal social welfare policies of the 1930s, is the only leader Samaras has not yet met in private.&#xa0;</p> <p>With the economy expected to be the focus of tomorrow\u2019s talks, the Greek prime minister who like the US president also attended Harvard, will almost certainly play on those sentiments.</p> <p>Now that Athens has succeeded in securing its place in the Eurozone - a place that was far from secure when the newly-installed leader met Angela Merkel for the first time this time last year - the Greek government, more than ever, is in need of allies to promote the one remedy that will get the debt-crippled country out of its austerity-induced economic death spiral \u2013 growth. That more than anything will mean persuading Berlin, the provider of most of the rescue funds Greece has received to date, to change tack.</p> <p>Samaras\u2019 aides are hoping that after Germany\u2019s September elections the EU powerhouse will soften its stance not least on the potentially explosive issue of an official sector debt restructuring \u2013 now seen, even by the IMF, as the only way of making Athens\u2019 monumental debt load sustainable. But the Greek government also knows it is in no position to raise the issue itself \u2013 a haircut, after all, would cost German tax payers in excess of \u20ac30 bn. Instead, much depends internationally on acknowledgement of the giant steps Greece has made in fiscal consolidation and this is where Washington comes in. A kind word from Obama could help immensely, say aides, in not only raising the off-limits subject, but giving succor to the government in what will surely be a very difficult winter and fall.</p> <p>Much more than just a photo-opportunity, Samaras is hoping his talks with Obama will send a message of optimism as much to Greeks as to the international creditors keeping the country\u2019s economy afloat.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52025c43e4b0c55edad46eaf\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-07T14:40:04.144Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Did Carney stoke Canada's housing boom?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Forward guidance might be causing hearts to beat faster in London, but in Canada it is old news.</p> <p>The BBC has a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23579905\">helpful piece</a> on Mark Carney\u2019s record at the Bank of Canada, where he launched a policy of forward guidance - or&#xa0;\u201cconditional commitment\u201d.</p> <p>Back in 2009, with western economies pitifully weakened after the financial crisis, Carney made a \u201csimple statement\u201d to Canadians to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.25% until the second quarter of 2010.</p> <p>Economic growth duly picked up, but critics say the low rates stoked a mortgage boom.</p> <p>As David Madani of Capital Economics told the BBC</p> <blockquote> <p>Low interest rates in Canada have definitely prolonged the boom, but households have also been part of the problem because they have been prepared to throw money at housing over the past few years.<br>I think when you look back at Mark Carney's record in 5 or 10 years' time, I think it will actually look quite ordinary.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>So what will be the judgement on Mr Carney at the end of his term in 2018? </em><em>We are not waiting 5 years to come to rough conclusions and you can vote in the Guardian's poll - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/poll/2013/aug/07/mark-carney-bank-of-england-poll\"><strong>has Mark Carney lived up to expectations?</strong></a></em></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52025575e4b01c89fee25839\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-07T14:11:01.667Z\">3.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Bets on Carney to break forward guidance</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And now the bookies' verdict on the Bank of England's forward guidance policy.

The Bank, though, considers this to be a risk worth running. It has plenty of experience of recessions caused by over-heating and knows how to deal with them. But the slump of 2007-09 was different. None of the normal policy tools were effective with a downturn caused by global financial systems failure. That\u2019s why exceptional measures were deemed necessary.

Today's announcement will be a further test to his power and abilities - quite how far he can go?</p> <p>Whatever is announced today,&#xa0;this is a man on a mission to create growth&#xa0;- highly useful for the Tories ahead of the 2015 election.

      "bodyText": "In the end it was Mark Carney's day. The new governor of the Bank of England announced that interest rates will stay at record lows until unemployment falls to 7% - an unprecedented bit of forward planning that divided economists. The TUC said the new governor's outlook was \"a much needed dose of realism after yesterday's 'Boom Britain' headlines\" (12.32) but the free-market thinktank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, branded it \"the most dangerous development in UK monetary policy since the late 1980s\" (2.04) The Guardian's economics correspondent Phillip Inman, sums up five things what we learned. The biggest news from the Eurozone was a big acceleration in German factory output data, while Portugal's unemployment fell slightly. So that is all for today. Thank you for following, for your comments, and have a good evening. A little piece of Spain's property boom - the airport at Ciudad Real in La Mancha - is up for auction. The starting price is \u20ac100m (\u00a386m), a steal, bearing in mind that it cost the Spanish taxpayer \u20ac1bn to build. Stephen Burgen, reporting from Barcelona, writes that \"the airport is one of the most egregious examples of the excesses of Spain's building boom\". The administrators of the airport say that its proponents \"never carried out an investment analysis\" nor did they produce a realistic business model and \"produced a financial plan that was not based on any studies of the market or of demand that would justify the anticipated traffic.\" Ciudad Real has a population of just 75,000 and many Spaniards would have trouble finding it on a map. Here is Stephen's article: Yours for \u20ac100m: Spanish airport, mint condition, one careless owner Stocks on Wall St opened lower for the third day in the row, as investors continue to fret about the US Federal Reserve winding down its stimulus programme. The S+P fell 0.5% to 1,688 points, the Dow Jones was also down 0.5% to 15,438. The dollar fell against the pound, which was buoyed up by the promise of low interest rates. This slip was little surprise to most investors, coming one day after a senior Fed official threw more cold water on the markets, when he said the Fed would scale back its massive bond-buying programme. Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, said: We are quite likely to reduce the flow of purchases rate starting later this year - I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly which month that will be - and it's likely to wind down over time in a couple or few stages. The Fed holds its next policy meeting in mid September. As it is central bank day, here is a look at the new boss of India's central bank, Raghuram Rajan, who takes over in September. As the Guardian reported yesterday, Rajan will take over at the Reserve Bank of India amid fears that the much-debated phasing out of America's stimulus package will push up the value of the dollar and trigger a currency crisis in emerging markets. Andy Mukherjee at Reuters Breaking Views writes that Rajan must show he is as good at managing financial crises as he is at predicting them. When he was chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Rajan was a prescient critic of a finance-fuelled credit boom, warning of \u201chidden tail risks\u201d as early as 2005. His first task as India\u2019s new central bank governor will be to avert the country\u2019s looming currency crisis. The Indian rupee is in free fall. It touched a record low against the dollar on Aug. 6...So how will Rajan avert a disaster? His stance is pro-growth, says a person who attended a meeting between him and private-sector economists four days before the RBI launched its growth-busting emergency measures. But in order to lower domestic interest rates at a time when US real rates are rising, Rajan will either need to introduce capital controls \u2013 as Malaysia did in 1998 \u2013 or win the confidence of global investors in India\u2019s growth revival plan. Rajan has strong credentials, and a winsome personality. What he doesn\u2019t have is time. Perhaps Mark Carney's task at the Bank of England is not so complicated after all... The Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has begun a much-anticipated visit to the United States, where he is meeting leading businessmen in the hope of luring investment today and holds crucial talks with US president Barack Obama tomorrow. Helena Smith, the Guardian's Athens correspondent, explains why the trip is so important: It\u2019s been nigh on nine years since a Greek prime minister held official talks with a US president in Washington. If timing is everything in politics, then the timing of Antonis Samaras\u2019 White House sit-down with president Barack Obama on Thursday could not be more prescient. Four years into Europe\u2019s worst economic crisis since the second world war, Greece, the nation where it all began, remains the front line state: the one EU member where it could all get better or all get worse. The US administration is not unsympathetic. From the outset, leading democrats have opposed the politics of austerity, with Obama at times almost pleading with Berlin to abandon its harsh fiscal policies in favour of development and growth. Obama, who has also defended the New Deal social welfare policies of the 1930s, is the only leader Samaras has not yet met in private. With the economy expected to be the focus of tomorrow\u2019s talks, the Greek prime minister who like the US president also attended Harvard, will almost certainly play on those sentiments. Now that Athens has succeeded in securing its place in the Eurozone - a place that was far from secure when the newly-installed leader met Angela Merkel for the first time this time last year - the Greek government, more than ever, is in need of allies to promote the one remedy that will get the debt-crippled country out of its austerity-induced economic death spiral \u2013 growth. That more than anything will mean persuading Berlin, the provider of most of the rescue funds Greece has received to date, to change tack. Samaras\u2019 aides are hoping that after Germany\u2019s September elections the EU powerhouse will soften its stance not least on the potentially explosive issue of an official sector debt restructuring \u2013 now seen, even by the IMF, as the only way of making Athens\u2019 monumental debt load sustainable. But the Greek government also knows it is in no position to raise the issue itself \u2013 a haircut, after all, would cost German tax payers in excess of \u20ac30 bn. Instead, much depends internationally on acknowledgement of the giant steps Greece has made in fiscal consolidation and this is where Washington comes in. A kind word from Obama could help immensely, say aides, in not only raising the off-limits subject, but giving succor to the government in what will surely be a very difficult winter and fall. Much more than just a photo-opportunity, Samaras is hoping his talks with Obama will send a message of optimism as much to Greeks as to the international creditors keeping the country\u2019s economy afloat. Forward guidance might be causing hearts to beat faster in London, but in Canada it is old news. The BBC has a helpful piece on Mark Carney\u2019s record at the Bank of Canada, where he launched a policy of forward guidance - or \u201cconditional commitment\u201d. Back in 2009, with western economies pitifully weakened after the financial crisis, Carney made a \u201csimple statement\u201d to Canadians to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.25% until the second quarter of 2010. Economic growth duly picked up, but critics say the low rates stoked a mortgage boom. As David Madani of Capital Economics told the BBC Low interest rates in Canada have definitely prolonged the boom, but households have also been part of the problem because they have been prepared to throw money at housing over the past few years. I think when you look back at Mark Carney's record in 5 or 10 years' time, I think it will actually look quite ordinary. So what will be the judgement on Mr Carney at the end of his term in 2018? We are not waiting 5 years to come to rough conclusions and you can vote in the Guardian's poll - has Mark Carney lived up to expectations? And now the bookies' verdict on the Bank of England's forward guidance policy. Ladbrokes reckons Mark Carney is odds on to break his shiny new policy before he finishes his term in 2018. Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes says: The forward guidance policy looks odds-on to be broken at some point in Carney's tenure. We're not sure about offering huge odds about it never happening either. And anyone who fancies George Osborne as the next governor of the Bank of England can get odds 66/1. Good news for Angela Merkel ahead of September's elections. German industrial output has risen at its fastest pace for two years. Industrial orders rebounded up 2.4% in June, following a dip in May, comfortably beating economists' expectations. The Ministry of Economics said some of the rebound was down to technical reasons - those pesky bank holidays that disrupt economic data. But economists sound pretty pleased. ING analyst Carsten Brzeski: \"It looks as if the German economy is again walking on two feet: solid private consumption and strengthening industrial activity.\" Hot off the wires: Portugal's new treasury secretary Joaquim Pais Jorge has resigned after just a few weeks in the job over a controversy linked to his previous job at Citgroup I took this difficult decision because I would never allow controversies surrounding my professional life, which I have never hidden, to be used as a political weapon against the government. Via Reuters This comes after news that Portugal's unemployment rate has dropped to 16.4% between April to June, down from a record 17.7% at the start of the year. So just a bit less terrible. Unemployment is now at its lowest point in two years. But it looks like some of the new jobs are seasonal, with the biggest fall in unemployment recorded in the Algarve. The Institute of Directors are also not in the Carney fan club. Here is Graeme Leach, the IOD's chief economist. Forward guidance doesn't really take us forward, and we are very concerned at the use of monetary policy to chase unemployment. We're still looking at an economy which will struggle to reach trend growth, let alone exceed it. Strong words from the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market think tank, which has described forward guidance as \"the most dangerous development in UK monetary policy since the late 1980s\". Here is the IEA's Philip Booth: Monetary policy should be designed to ensure that we have stable prices. The level of unemployment is mainly determined by a range of factors such a labour market regulation, the benefits system, tax rates and so on. To try to use monetary policy to reduce unemployment when inflation is already above target is playing with fire and could lead us down the road that we followed in the 1970s. This move also calls into question the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee and the Bank of England's ability to fulfil its statutory duties A quick riposte from former MPC member Danny Blanchflower. If the IEA think it's a bad idea, then it must be good. Hi, Jennifer Rankin taking over from Graeme Wearden, who is starting his well-deserved holiday. This morning's decision by the Bank of England to tie interest rates to unemployment was a momentous one. Here is the verdict from the Guardian's economics editor Larry Elliott. The Bank of England has never had interest rates this low in its 319-year history and is on course to keep them pegged at 0.5% for longer than it look the Allies to win the Second World War, longer than the French Revolution between the storming of the Bastille and the topping of Robespierre and longer than it took the Beatles to record everything from Love Me Do to Abbey Road. Quite a period, in other words, and evidence of just how fragile Threadneedle Street thinks the economy remains following the deepest recession and the slowest recovery in recorded history. Britain\u2019s predilection for booms and busts in the past 40 years means that a good old-fashioned housing bubble, with its attendant balance of payments deficits, cannot be ruled out. The Bank, though, considers this to be a risk worth running. It has plenty of experience of recessions caused by over-heating and knows how to deal with them. But the slump of 2007-09 was different. None of the normal policy tools were effective with a downturn caused by global financial systems failure. That\u2019s why exceptional measures were deemed necessary. And are still deemed necessary, whatever the side effects may prove to be. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has thrown his support behind Mark Carney, welcoming the 'leadership' shown by the new governor today. Balls also used the new unemployment target as a stick to poke chancellor George Osborne: Balls said: By recognising the importance of policy action to support jobs and growth, at last we are seeing the Governor show the leadership we have failed to see over the last three years and are still not seeing from the Chancellor. Mark Carney is right to warn that the recovery is weak. It is the slowest on record and families are facing a growing cost of living crisis. But the new Governor is not a miracle worker and monetary policy cannot do the job alone. As we and the IMF have consistently said George Osborne must finally act to support the economy and also help families feeling the squeeze. Balls also warned cautioned that the Bank will have to show \"careful vigilance\" to avoid inflation now taking off. And on that note, I'm handing over the live blog to my colleague Jennifer Rankin. My personal forward guidance is that the ferry from Portsmouth to Caen leaves tonight, and I'd better be on it..... Cheers all. GW Shares have fallen in London since the Bank of England announced its new forward guidance, with the FTSE 100 down 52 points, or 0.8%, at 6,551. Traders say that Mark Carney's gloomy comments about the state of the economy are to blame. The governor warned that Britain is not yet at escape velocity, and pointedly said this was the weakest recovery in over a hundred years. As Logic Investments director Khilan Shah put it: The forward guidance is not great. Sky's Ed Conway tweets two other important sections from today's report: Today's forward guidance policy from the Bank of England (online here) includes this chart showing how it expects the unemployment rate to fall in the coming years (assuming rates remain at 0 .5%): As a fan chart, it shows the likely path of joblessness -- the darker the colour, the higher the chances of the forecast being right. Mortgage brokers are already predicting that interest rates on five year fixed rate loans will now start heading down, our Money editor Patrick Collinson flags up. He explains: Jonathan Harris of mortgage broker Anderson Harris said: \u201cWe expect fixed-rate mortgages to fall even further on the back of this announcement. They may already be at historic lows but if lenders are to convince borrowers to opt for a fix when interest rates are highly unlikely to rise, then pricing needs to be attractive.\u201d As financial journalist James Andrews tweeted, two year fixed rates now look \u201cpointless\u201d as they are usually priced above \u2018tracker\u2019 rates that follow the Bank of England base rate: Patrick adds that estate agents are also jumping for joy at Carney\u2019s announcement. Marsh and Parsons, which has more than a dozen offices across the wealthier parts of London, says Carney has \u201cgiven the UK\u2019s housing market a significant boost.\u201d But for savers, the gloom continues. Funding for Lending has already depressed cash Isa rates, and today\u2019s announcement means that savers will be hard-pressed to find returns anywhere much above 2% for some time to come. The early reaction to the Bank of England's new policy is decidedly mixed. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady has welcomed the focus on unemployment, saying: Today's announcement shows that the bank understands a real recovery is something that benefits ordinary people, and not just an upward blip in economists' outlooks. The new governor's outlook also provides a much needed dose of realism after yesterday's 'Boom Britain' headlines But Mark Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons it's a 'big mistake' UK ILO [International Labour Organisation] labour data may be better \"qualitatively\" than many other official statistical series, but as the MPC has discussed in hushed tones (due to the political and social sensitivity) in previous minutes, it is difficult to assess how many of the longer-term unemployed are in fact largely unemployable... We're collecting all the analyst reaction to today's news, here: Bank of England inflation report: what the economists say Here's our news story about the Bank of England announcing that it will link interest rates to the UK's jobless targets: Bank of England links interest rates to jobless target The Bank of England has tied a rise in interest rates to a drop in the unemployment rate to 7%. The dramatic announcement means the economy will need to generate around another 750,000 jobs before the central bank considers hiking rates from their current all-time low of 0.5%. This, combined with rising wages, would represent \"real improvements in the lives of people across the nation\" said new Bank governor Mark Carney. Unveiling a new strategy of forward guidance, Carney said a further boost to quantitative easing was also possible while unemployment remained above the 7% threshold. Full story here. Are you impressed by Mark Carney's first big announcement, or are you alarmed by today's developments? Vote here: Has Mark Carney lived up to expectations? Our economics correspondent, Phillip Inman, suggests that Mark Carney might have favoured an even lower unemployment target: Louise Cooper of CooperCity isn't impressed that the Bank has identified a medium-term inflation rate of 2.5% as one of its 'knockout' factors that could force it to drop the unemployment target. Given the official inflation target is 2%, is the Bank going soft on the cost of living? (note. As explained at 11.13am Carney did deny that the inflation target had been raised when challenged about it). Stephen Evans, a former staffer at the Treasury, backs Mark Carney's view that the UK economy is still relatively weak: David Smith of the Sunday Times sums the press conference up: The press conference -- one of the most interesting we've seen at the Bank of England for some time -- is now over. Reaction, analysis, details ,etc etc, to follow... One more interesting reply from Mark Carney. Asked by Faisal Islam of Channel 4 whether today's announcement is \"clarification\" or \"further loosening\" , Carney is adamant that it's \"clarification\". This is about reassuring businesses and individuals about the future path of interest rates under current monetary policy -- making the current stimulus measures \"more effective'. Hugh Pym of the BBC asks Carney why the Bank of England needs to announce new guidance today, when the economy is recovering. Carney minces no words, saying: This is the weakest economy on record, and those records go back more than one hundred years. There is significant slack.... and [the danger is that] the understandable feeling builds up that the Bank will start to pull back on the monetary stimulus packages [that have helped create the recovery]. The MPC is saying is that we need to make further progress....before we start to pull back, he adds. Ed Conway of Sky News asks for clarity about Mark Carney's suggestion that the Bank was not ruling out further asset purchases (quantitative easing) if needed. If that happens, are gilts (government debt), the right thing to buy? Carney declines to comment on that today, and points out that he'd only have one voice among nine if, and when, the Monetary Policy Committee considered the issue. Another question -- how serious is the situation in the eurozone crisis? Carney says that \"there has been important progress, and there remains important work to do\" to create a stable monetary union and get the eurozone economy back to growth. The pound fell sharply at 10.30am, but rallied during today's press conference as the markets digested Carney's words. (via Michael Hewson of CMC Markets). To be clear, there are three caveats, or \"Knockouts\", that the Bank has agreed in return for pledging to leave monetary policy unchanged until the unemployment rate falls to 7%. \u2022 if inflation in 18 to 24 months time threatens to be more than 0.5 above target, \u2022 if inflationary pressures are building over medium term, \u2022 and if there is risk to financial stability that can't be contained using other tools. From the press conference, our economics editor Larry Elliott reports that this is a \"very big change\" to monetary policy from the Bank of Engand. He reports: BoE has set a 7% unemployment threshold for raising interest rates. That means at the current rate of improvement interest rates will not rise this side of general election in 2015. QE will also not be reversed until the 7% threshold is reached. Larry added that the new governor gave \"a deadpan opening statement\". None of Sir Mervyn King's sporting metaphors. Perhaps Carney felt that ice hockey analogies would be wasted on the London press pack If you're just joining us, the Bank of England's historic press conference is being streamed here. And our coverage starts at 10.30am Phil Aldrick of the Daily Telegraph asks whether the Bank is risking a dangerous, \"unbalanced\" recovery. He also seeks details about how the Financial Policy Committee could 'knock out' the new unemployment target if it has concerns about financial stability. Carney replies: In a global economy that remains relatively weak, and with our largest trading partner moving sideways, the path to sustainable recovery is to increase productivity. So, the FPC could raise a red flag if it thinks conditions are taking the wrong turn. Deputy governor Charlie Bean elaborates -- The UK economy needs to be rebalanced, but this isn't the ideal environment for it. Firms need help and certainty if they're going to increase business investment, he adds. Question: Has the Bank of England effectively raised its inflation target, from 2% to 2.5%, by saying that it could abandon the aim of a 7% unemployment rate if inflation is heading above 2.5% on a 18 to 24-month horizon? Carney denies it. The MPC is still committed to a 2% rate. And with CPI at 2.9% last month, it has work to do. Claire Jones of the Financial Times asks whether the MPC was unanimous in choosing a 7% unemployment rate as the new measure of the UK's financial health. Carney refuses to reveal the answer. As with all MPC decisions, you'll have to wait for the minutes to find out, he smiles.... Hugo Duncan of the Daily Mail asks if the UK banking sector is strong enough to take advantage of the ultra-low monetary policy being promised today. Carney replies that \"considerable progress\" has beem made improving the resilisnce of the banking sector -- many building societies and \"nearly all banks\" meet the new risk measurement, called the 'leverage ratio' (Barclays is the laggard, and announced a rights issue to raise capital last week). Carney is positive about prospects, saying: The ability to provide lending to the real economy has improved. Jennifer Ryan of Bloomberg News asks the Governor why the Bank has raised its growth forecasts today -- it now expects GDP to rise by 0.6% in the third quarter of this year, rising to 2.6 per year in two years. Carney cites \"a variety of hard and soft data\", including from the Bank's agents around the country, back up the view that the economy is recovering. Ben Chu of the Independent asks if the UK has reached 'escape velocity' - one of Carney's big themes. No, Carney replies. Sam Fleming of the Times asks how much faith the public can have in the new forecasts, Carney says there are 'specific sensitivities' in the Bank's new thinking (see 10.42am) to underpin the accuracy of its assessment. Not everyone will agree, though, he admits: People will have different views. That's entirely reasonable. Today's plan, though, is an opportunity to \"coalesce\" views around the conditions under which monetary policy should be tightened. And if the recovery faltered, or a member of the Monetary Policy Committee felt that additional stimulus was needed, she or he could argue for it, Carney adds. What keeps you up at night, governor, asks Guy Falconbridge of Reuters, who helpfully suggests the UK Help To Buy scheme. Carney replies that his biggest fear is that: As the recovery gathers pace, there is an unwarranted expectation about the pace of the withdrawal monetary policy stimulus. Thus the need for forward guidance. Carney also gently refutes concerns over Help to Buy -- a new plan to help people buy homes. He says: \u2022 Mortgate applications below historical averages - below 60,000 per month, and the Bank would expect an increase \u2022 High loan-to-value morttages are only 40% of the market - not 70% at the height of the boom \u2022 Valuations are still 'quite a way off' historic highs. Bill Keegan of the Observer gets the second question - to what extent is fiscal policy helping to get unemployment down to the 7% threshold set today? Mark Carney says that the Bank seeks stable inflation at the 2% target -- but it is determined to give \"due consideration\" to output and unemployment do to that. Carney insists that unemployment is not a \"target\": It's the best summary indicator of the condiations in the economy at which the MPC would begin to withdraw the exceptional monetary stimulus that is in place. Over to questions... and our economics editor Larry Elliott gets the first one. What proof is there that UK unemployment and inflation are linked? In other words, what basis is the Bank working on when it says that the unemployment target could be abandoned if inflation is heading over the 2.5% rate in the medium term? The key question, Carney says, is now much slack there is in the UK economy today. The MPC believes there is a margin of slack, a margin of productivity, that can be recovered as the economy recovers, he says. Here's a link to inflation report: Here's a link to forward guidance: A fall in unemployment, from 7.8% to 7%, would mean another 750,000 new jobs for the nation, Carney adds. Carney also says that the Bank of England could still launch more quantitative easing if needed, and it does not expect to unwind QE until the unemployment rate hits the 7% threshhold. Effectlvely, the Bank of England is suggesting that interest rates will remain at 0.5% for a year longer than the markets had expected. Crucially, this pledge to keep rates at record lows until the unemployment rate falls to 7% isn't set in stone. It could be set aside if the Bank feels that, on a medium-term timescale, the CPI measure of inflation will be above 2.5%. Currently, it's goal is to keep inflation near 2%. The MPC will also use inflation expectations as a guide. Governor Mark Carney is explaining the new policy now. He says that Britain is recoving from an unprecedented financial crisis, and that the unemployment rate is the biggest sign that the UK still needs help. Reminder - you can watch the Bank of England press conference here. Here's the details of the Bank's new policy on interest rates, from Reuters: The Bank of England plans to keep interest rates at a record low until unemployment falls to 7% - something unlikely for another three years - in a major new departure for British monetary policy. Barely a month after Canadian Mark Carney took over from the long-serving Mervyn King as BoE governor, the central bank said on Wednesday that it would keep interest rates at 0.5 percent unless inflation threatened to get out of control or there was a danger to financial stability . \"Until the margin of slack within the economy has narrowed significantly, it will be appropriate to maintain the current exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy,\" the BoE said. BoE policymakers said they stood ready to buy more government bonds if additional stimulus was needed and would not reverse existing purchases while unemployment was too high. The BoE said that growth was likely to be \"weak by historical standards\", even though economic recovery was \"taking hold\" and inflation was forecast to stay above its 2 percent target until the second half of 2015 based on market rate expectations. \"Attempting to return inflation to the target too quickly risks prolonging the period over which the nation's resources are underutilised,\" the central bank said. BREAKING: The Bank of England has tied future interest rates to unemployment levels. They will stay low until the jobless rate hits 7%. It's 7.8% today. You can always rely on the Financial Times for accuracy... Any moment now..... The Bank of England is live-streaming today's quarterly inflation report press conference on its website, ahead of the 10.30am start. It's a good service, as it also includes key pages from the report itself. Click here to see it (perhaps a new browser tab....) There's currently a 'lock-in' for newswire reporters at the Bank, so the details of the report should emerge at 10.30am sharp, when Mark Carney will also start speaking.. Jonathan Pryor of Investec Corporate Treasury reminds us that the Bank of England will also announce new GDP forecasts this morning, and probably predict stronger growth: He writes: Away from the Bank of England\u2019s announcements today, growth projections will be eagerly awaited. We saw a rise in Q2 GDP, which climbed 0.6% and this was followed by the Bank of England suggesting we could well see an increase in growth through Q3. As such, many are expecting to see a rise in the GDP forecast for both the remainder of 2013 and 2014. If this prediction is correct then the adage of \u2018you can\u2019t take with both hands\u2019 will come into play as a firmer GDP number will no doubt suggest inflationary pressure. Three months ago, at the last quarterly inflation report, the Bank raised its GDP forecast for 2013 to more than 1% growth, from 0.9%. That does look conservative, as Britain has already posted 0.3% growth in Q1, and 0.6% in Q2. I mentioned in the opening post that governor Carney had made a 'sure-footed' start to his time at the Bank of England. Well, Louise Cooper, analyst at CooperCity, agrees, but points out that the hard work starts now. Taking the tube to work on your first day, unveiling Jane Austen as the (worthy) face of the next ten pound note, and persuading the doves at the Bank of England to stop squawking about more quantitative easing is the easy bit of Governing, she writes: Trained as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs, it should be no surprise that Carney is a smooth operator. From his first day when he arrived at Threadneedle Street by public transport rather than the chauffeured car, he has demonstrated his skills. He announced that Jane Austen is to be the female face on a Bank of England ten pound note. And he has turned a split MPC into agreement on QE. Today's announcement will be a further test to his power and abilities - quite how far he can go? Whatever is announced today, this is a man on a mission to create growth - highly useful for the Tories ahead of the 2015 election. Under Carney it is clear that GDP is more important than fighting inflation. His arrival is clearly good for the indebted and offers yet more pain for savers. Recent upbeat economic news makes setting forward guidance harder, she adds. Carney, of course, is getting a handsome salary and housing allowance to make the right calls. As Andrew Clark pointed out in The Times yesterday: We\u2019re about to find out whether the man from Alberta is worth the hype, the political capital and the big house in West Hampstead. The Times: Dilemma to test Mark Carney\u2019s worth (\u00a3) The pound has fallen against the US dollar this morning, shedding almost half a cent to $1.5301. It's broadly flat against the euro, though, at \u20ac1.152. The big mover overnight is the Japanese yen, up almost one percent to 96.9 yen against the dollar - a six-week high. That sparked a rout on Japan's stock market. The Nikkei tumbled 4% on fears that the country's huge stimulus package - which relies on a weak yen - was losing momentum. In the reader comments, Halo572 is struck by Carney's ability to grab the limelight: Poor Uncle Lord Sir Mervyn, off standing by the sea shouting at it to not come in and disobey him, another nail in his tenure's coffin as the greatest economic showman on Earth shows him how it really should have been done. And wishfulfilment is also critical: Economics lecturer Stephen Kinsella tweets that we might be getting a little carried away.... City analysts are also intruiged about the prospect of forward guidance from the Bank of England. Kit Juckes of Societe Generale cautions about not getting carried away: BOE Governor Mark Carney\u2019s success with forward guidance in Canada is part of his CV, but \u2018reaching over the heads of markets\u2019 and telling the people of the UK that rates will stay low for a long time, won\u2019t have so much effect. Rate expectations are already low. As for markets, the biggest effect may be on inflation expectations. Jane Foley of Rabobank reckons that Carney will not nail the Bank's trousers to an explicit target, such as the unemployment rate: Our expectation is that forward guidance used by the Bank will be simple and not tied to the performance of a particular economic variable. Speculation that the MPC could commit to maintain accommodative policy settings until a certain economic threshold has been reached appears to be based on the Federal Reserve\u2019s current focus on the unemployment rate. However, the Fed has had a mandate to target employment for years, the BoE has not. Barclays economist Simon Hayes agrees that the Bank may not ignite many monetary firecrackers today: This [guidance] may not constitute the 'shock and awe' monetary activism that came to be expected from Governor Carney when he was first appointed, but the improved economic circumstances have reduced the need for emergency support. Robert Wood of Berenberg Bank says the goal is to keep borrowing costs stable while the UK economy picks up speed: The recovery could quickly lose steam if mortgage rates rise, so the BoE\u2019s job now is to use guidance to ensure that the stimulus is not withdrawn prematurely. And economist Shaun Richards writes that Carney shouldn't overestimate his own abilities: The fundamental problem with moving towards a type of command economy approach which forward guidance represents is the implication that the future is in some way known. I have written before of the way that this mimics in some respects the themes of the God Emperor of Dune but forgets that Leto II was prescient and could see at least some of the future. If there is one lesson that the credit crunch has taught us it is that central bankers are by no means prescient. Otherwise how did we get here? The UK media are awash with speculation about today's Quarterly Inflation report, and the first chance to see Mark Carney at a UK press conference. The Financial Times points out that some senior members of the Bank aren't as keen on the idea of pledging low interest rates as Carney himself: It is Mark Carney\u2019s big idea to lift the UK economy out of the doldrums and into what he has termed \u201cescape velocity\u201d. Others interpret this as a self-sustaining recovery. However, while Mr Carney\u2019s a fan of guidance, the rest of the MPC might take some convincing. Four of the current membership, including deputy governor Charlie Bean and chief economist Spencer Dale, have spoken out against forward guidance in the past. FT: Forward guidance, BoE style: five questions Reuters reminds us that Carney was an early pioneer of forward guidance: As central bank chief in his native Canada in 2009, he took what was then the unusual step of committing to putting interest rates on ice for more than a year during the worst of the crisis. The task looks a lot more complicated in London. Reuters: Carney's Bank of England set to join forward guidance club Sky News agrees that this is the most significant changes to the way the Bank conducts monetary policy since it was granted independence in 1997. Economists say the bank may pledge to leave rates unchanged until the unemployment rate drops beneath a certain threshold. Allan Monks of JP Morgan said he expected that level to be 7%, but added that the main message will be \"that rates are unlikely to rise for the next two years or more - despite the better signs on growth\". Sky: Bank Of England To Unveil Monetary Policy Shift The BBC reports that the financial markets could be cheered by today's guidance: Adrian Lowcock, at the stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said that markets could jump higher if the Bank's announcement on Wednesday \"hits the right notes\". \"We could see UK shares rally and the FTSE may very well reach an all-time high,\" he said. BBC: Bank of England set to unveil 'forward guidance' While in the Telegraph, Allister Heath takes a contrary view - arguing that the Bank of England should be tightening monetary policy, not promising to keep it ultra-loose: Upping rates by a quarter or even half a per cent, for starters, would send shockwaves around the world. It would reinforce the Bank\u2019s commitment to controlling inflation and that it believes that the worst of the crisis is behind us. It would boost confidence in the recovery, confirm that the process of normalisation has begun and act as a warning to still over-leveraged firms and families that this is the last chance for them to get their act together. Telegraph: Mark Carney is about to make his first mistake - not raising interest rates Good morning. Mark Carney has made a pretty sure-footed start since replacing Sir Mervyn King as Bank of England governor five weeks ago. Today, the central banker from Canada faces his first big test \u2013 ushering Britain into a new world of Forward Guidance. For the first time in its history, the Bank will lay out how long it will leave UK interest rates at their current record low levels. Economists believe the BoE could pledge not to touch borrowing costs until unemployment had fallen to a certain level, or until the UK has racked up more growth. Or perhaps for a fixed period of time. The move gives Carney and crew an extra weapon in their monetary policy armory \u2013 and with rates down at 0.5% and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing already deployed (to buy UK government debt), they could use it. As Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics explains: Guidance could play an important role in the coming months if it keeps rate expectations anchored as the recovery picks up pace. The details will come at Carney's first press conference, for the Bank's Quarterly Inflation Report, in which UK growth forecasts are likely to be raised... ...And that makes today's task rather trickier that it appeared back in March when chancellor George Osborne invited the BoE to consider forward guidance. Then, Britain feared a triple-dip recession. Now, it knows that the double-dip never happened. The economy is still smaller than in 2008, but we've seen plenty of encouraging private sector data in recent days \u2013 including the best month for service sector activity since 2006, and a jump in industrial output. With some newspapers (not this one) even claiming that Britain is \"booming\", should the Bank really be promising to keep the party going? However, with real wages falling and living standards squeezed, Carney can certainly argue that the UK economy needs all the help it can get. The quarterly inflation report is released at 10.30am BST, immediately followed by a press conference inside the Bank where a flock of Britain's economics journalists will quiz Carney about his plans. I'll track all the action in the liveblog -- along with other events across the financial markets, the world economy, and the eurozone. It's an otherwise quiet day, though, so Carney gets the limelight.",

      "body": "<p>The UK economy will need to generate around 750,000 more jobs before the Bank of England considers lifting interest rates from their current all-time low of 0.5%, the central bank's new governor, Mark Carney, has announced.</p> <p>Unveiling a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx\" title=\"\">new strategy of forward guidance</a>, Carney said a further boost to quantitative easing was also possible while unemployment remained above the 7% threshold.</p> <p>On the current trend for unemployment, which stands at 7.8%, it is likely to take three years for the bank to reach its target, comforting businesses and homebuyers who can continue to borrow at low rates until at least 2016.</p> <p>Carney said this, combined with rising wages, would represent \"real improvements in the lives of people across the nation\".</p> <p>The governor said Britain had suffered an unprecedented financial crisis but that \"a renewed recovery\" was under way.

      "bodyText": "The UK economy will need to generate around 750,000 more jobs before the Bank of England considers lifting interest rates from their current all-time low of 0.5%, the central bank's new governor, Mark Carney, has announced. Unveiling a new strategy of forward guidance, Carney said a further boost to quantitative easing was also possible while unemployment remained above the 7% threshold. On the current trend for unemployment, which stands at 7.8%, it is likely to take three years for the bank to reach its target, comforting businesses and homebuyers who can continue to borrow at low rates until at least 2016. Carney said this, combined with rising wages, would represent \"real improvements in the lives of people across the nation\". The governor said Britain had suffered an unprecedented financial crisis but that \"a renewed recovery\" was under way. The Bank raised its growth forecasts, predicting economic growth would reach an annual rate of at least 2% by the end of 2013 \u2013 a year sooner than previously predicted. \"There are clear signs that economic activity has strengthened this year,\" Carney said. \"But there should be little satisfaction. Much is at stake as we seek to secure this recovery and return inflation to target.\" The unemployment rate was the biggest sign that the UK still needs help, Carney said. \"Until the margin of slack within the economy has narrowed significantly, it will be appropriate to maintain the current exceptionally stimulative stance of monetary policy.\" Concerns that the current recovery, which has seen GDP rise 0.9% in the first six months of the year, could increase inflation beyond the bank's 2% target were dismissed by Carney, although he said inflation remained a primary concern. Inflation was unlikely to rise above 3% this year \u2013 lower than previous fears of a peak of around 3.5%. Carney said the unemployment target could be abandoned should the bank's internal analysis show GDP growth was the cause of a rise in prices of more than 2.5% in two years' time. The Bank said: \"While job growth has been a relative positive in recent years, unemployment is still high. \"There are one million more people unemployed today than before the financial crisis; and many who have jobs would like to work more than they currently can. The weakness in activity has also been accompanied by exceptionally weak productivity. It is for these reasons that the MPC [monetary policy committee] judges there to be a significant margin of slack in the economy, even though the extent of that slack, particularly the scope for a productivity rebound, is very uncertain\". The US Federal Reserve, which has continued to expand its stimulus package despite a strong recovery, has tied a rise in interest rates to an unemployment rate of 6.5%, which analysts expect will be reached by the summer of 2015. Like Carney, Fed boss Ben Bernanke has said reaching the target will only trigger a debate about raising rates, not an immediate hike. There is a lively debate among economists over the amount of slack in the economy. The MPC, which Carney chairs, has appeared split in recent months over the need for further stimulus for the economy and the likely benefit of providing forward guidance. The Bank's chief economist Spencer Dale, and Carney's right-hand man Charlie Bean, a deputy governor, had made speeches outlining the possible problems of locking the Bank's decision-making to specific economic data. It seems that Carney has persuaded the committee to side with economists who say that unemployment is a sure sign that the economy remains weak and can generate extra supply without causing inflation. Threadneedle Street has picked 7% as the \"natural rate\" of unemployment. A lower level of unemployment may begin to generate labour shortages in some areas and drive up wages and inflation. Critics of the central bank argue that the recession following the banking crash destroyed a slice of the UK's productive capacity and that the extra demand created by low interest rates would be met by producers not with extra supply, but with higher prices. There are also concerns that a commitment to keep interest rates low will trigger a house price boom, leading to an unsustainable bubble. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank's move means rates were unlikely to rise until 2016 or even later. \"[The MPC] does not intend to raise interest rates until unemployment falls below 7%. Admittedly this is not too far below the current unemployment rate of 7.8%,\" she said. \"But the MPC sees scope for a period of strong GDP growth driven by a rebound in productivity growth.

      "bodyText": "Gina Rinehart's attempt to force a journalist to reveal his sources was dismissed only on the basis of Western Australia's shield laws. All the other arguments from the newspaper's lawyers were rejected. Rinehart subpoenaed the Walkley award-winning journalist Steve Pennells and the newspaper company he worked for to hand over all notes, recordings and communication in relation to her company Hancock Prospecting, her son, John Hancock, and the billion-dollar trust which is at the centre of a legal battle between Rinehart and two of her children. Pennells and West Australian Newspapers (WAN) refused to do so, sparking a legal battle which ended on Tuesday in the first real test of WA's shield laws. WAN tried to have the subpoena dismissed on several grounds including that it was oppressive, breached confidentiality, the scope was too large and it was an abuse of process but all arguments failed, the WA supreme court justice Janine Pritchard ruled. She also dismissed an attempt by WAN to reject the subpoenas on the grounds of the \"newspaper rule\" which submits that it is in the public interest to maintain confidentiality agreements between journalists and their sources. But Pritchard found that WA's shield laws \u2013 which were introduced last year \u2013 were the only grounds needed to reject the subpoena, and in relation to those laws the application was oppressive and an abuse of process. \"I have reached the conclusion that if Mr Pennells, or an officer of WAN, were called to give identifying evidence of the same kind as is contained in the documents sought, then on the basis of the information presently available, it is very unlikely that they could be compelled to do so,\" Pritchard said in her judgment. \"To require the production of documents containing the same identifying information under a subpoena would negate the very protection that the parliament has sought to create ... \"The result in this case does not mean that a subpoena for the production of documents held by a journalist or his or her employer could never be enforced.\" The shield laws are split into two parts, the first relating to a variety of occupations and their right to protect information given to them confidentiality \u2013 such as accountants and sex counsellors. The second part relates to journalists and whether they can be compelled to give evidence on the identity of their informants. The laws did not refer directly to subpoenas. Rinehart's lawyers tried to prevent the judgment being made public but that application was dismissed by Pritchard. The Fairfax journalist Adele Ferguson, who wrote an unauthorised biography of Rinehart, is still facing a court battle over a subpoena served on her by Rinehart demanding access to her source material for the book and other articles. Ferguson's case remains at the directions stage and, after the judgment in the Pennells case, she said shield laws similar to those in WA should be in place across Australia. \"I think it is a great win for journalism and press freedom,\" she said. \"The judgment was strong and made it clear that sources should be protected and journalistic ethics respected. \"But shield laws need to be stronger, as we can't leave it up to the courts to make a judgment on a case-by-case basis.\" Pennells was in the court for the delivery on the judgment on Tuesday and called it \"incredible\". \"It's better than I ever dreamed of,\" he told Guardian Australia. \"It effectively enshrines in law the sacred practices of journalism such as protection of sources and the public's right to know.\" Rinehart's lawyers will argue next month for the case against WAN to be reopened.",

      "bodyText": "Fortescue Metals expressed its disappointment at the high court's unanimous decision to dismiss its challenge to the mining tax, describing the levy as \"unfair, discriminatory and complex\". Fortescue's chief executive, Nev Power, said the company, whose case was supported by the Western Australian and Queensland governments, considered the minerals resource rent tax \"an unreasonable intrusion into an area of state responsibility\". The federal government welcomed the court's decision, saying it demonstrated that the constitutional basis for the tax was sound. But the future of the tax, which came into effect in July 2012, remains uncertain; the Coalition has pledged to abolish it. \"The good news is that if you vote for the Coalition the mining tax will be scrapped,\" the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, said after the decision. Under the tax, companies pay 22.5% on profits above $75m from iron ore and coal production, though they can deduct state royalties first. In a statement to the stock exchange, Fortescue Metals, which is owned by Andrew Forrest, thanked Abbott and the Coalition for standing by the mining industry with their promise to repeal the tax. \"Fortescue expects to pay $1.5bn in company tax and royalties this financial year, rising to $2bn in years ahead,\" Mr Power said. The court ordered Fortescue to pay costs. The company had argued that the mining tax was an unconstitutional interference by the commonwealth into states' functions and diminished their capacity to manage their resources. It also said it breached a provision of the constitution that prohibits the commonwealth from discriminating between the states, owing to the different tax systems in different states. A professor of law at the University of Melbourne, Michael Crommelin, said company and the states were concentrating their main argument on the view that the commonwealth could not use its powers in way that inhibited the states' essential functions. \"Queensland and Western Australia really concentrated on this point,\" Crommelin said. \"They felt they had their best chance. They argued states had always managed their resources and these resources belonged to the states.\" He said the six judges had found that that there was no formal discrimination by the commonwealth between the states in law. The tax famously only raised $126m in its first six months, compared with a forecast $2bn, a result that former treasurer Wayne Swan put down to falling commodity prices.
