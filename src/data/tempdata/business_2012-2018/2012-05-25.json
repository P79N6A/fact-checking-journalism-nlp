    "webTitle": "It's payback time: don't expect sympathy \u2013 Lagarde to Greeks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has ratcheted up the pressure on crisis-hit Greece after its managing director, Christine Lagarde, said she has more sympathy for children deprived of decent schooling in sub-Saharan Africa than for many of those facing poverty in Athens. In an uncompromising interview with the Guardian, Lagarde insists it is payback time for Greece and makes it clear that the IMF has no intention of softening the terms of the country's austerity package. Using some of the bluntest language of the two-and-a-half-year debt crisis, she says Greek parents have to take responsibility if their children are being affected by spending cuts. \"Parents have to pay their tax,\" she says. Greece, which has seen its economy shrink by a fifth since the recession began, has been told to cut wages, pensions and public spending in return for financial help from the IMF, the European Union and the European Central Bank. Asked whether she is able to block out of her mind the mothers unable to get access to midwives or patients unable to obtain life-saving drugs, Lagarde replies: \"I think more of the little kids from a school in a little village in Niger who get teaching two hours a day, sharing one chair for three of them, and who are very keen to get an education. I have them in my mind all the time. Because I think they need even more help than the people in Athens.\" Lagarde, predicting that the debt crisis has yet to run its course, adds: \"Do you know what? As far as Athens is concerned, I also think about all those people who are trying to escape tax all the time. All these people in Greece who are trying to escape tax.\" She says she thinks \"equally\" about Greeks deprived of public services and Greek citizens not paying their tax. \"I think they should also help themselves collectively.\" Asked how, she replies: \"By all paying their tax.\" Asked if she is essentially saying to the Greeks and others in Europe that they have had a nice time and it is now payback time, she responds: \"That's right.\" The intervention by Lagarde comes after the caretaker Greek government met to discuss a sharp fall in tax revenues \u2013 down by a third in a year. Under the terms of the country's bailout, Athens has agreed to improve Greece's poor record for tax collection in order to reduce its budget deficit, and Lagarde's remarks are evidence of a growing impatience in the international community. Reports surfaced in Germany and France of preparations being made to cope with Greece's possible departure from the single currency after its election on 17 June. Belgium's deputy prime minister, Didier Reynders, said it would be a \"serious professional error\" if central banks and companies did not prepare for an exit. The euro came under fresh attack on the foreign exchanges, dropping below \u20ac1.25 at one point on Friday, as the Spanish government was in talks to pump up to \u20ac19bn of rescue finance into Bankia, one of the country's biggest banks, and the Catalan regional government sought financial help from Madrid to deal with its debts. Signs emerged of a widening gulf between Germany and France over whether common eurobonds should be issued to help those countries, such as Greece and Spain, with high interest rates on their debt. Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, poured cold water on the idea \u2013 which is strongly backed by the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2013 and also said financial aid to Greece should be cut off if it failed to keep to the bailout deal. J\u00fcrgen Fitschen, joint head of Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche, described Greece as \"a failed state \u2026 a corrupt state\". Separately, however, there were reports suggesting that the chancellor, Angela Merkel, was dusting down the economic modernisation plan used to revive East Germany after the fall of communism in the belief that similar measures could be applied to Greece and other struggling eurozone countries. Today's Der Spiegel magazine says Merkel will present a six-point plan based on the East German blueprint as a growth strategy. It includes measures such as privatisation, looser employment law and lower tax rates. Opinion polls are pointing to a close race between parties backing and opposing the terms of Greece's \u20ac130bn bailout, but neither Germany nor the IMF has demonstrated any willingness to water down Greece's austerity programme. In her interview Lagarde says Greece is not getting softer treatment than a poor country in the developing world, and that the IMF does not find it harder to impose strong conditions on a rich nation. \"No, it's not harder. No. Because it's the mission of the fund, and it's my job to say the truth, whoever it is across the table. And I tell you something: it's sometimes harder to tell the government of low-income countries, where people live on $3,000, $4,000 or $5,000 per capita per year, to actually strengthen the budget and reduce the deficit. Because I know what it means in terms of welfare programmes and support for the poor. It has much bigger ramifications.\"",

      "bodyText": "Of all Spain's troubled banks, Bankia has the biggest exposure to failed property developments. At the last count it had \u20ac37bn (\u00a329bn) in loans to housebuilders, with a backlog of interest payments on almost three in 10. To make matters worse, the bank has \u20ac9.1bn of repossessed property sitting on its books. Fears that Spain cannot cope without an EU bailout are fuelled by figures showing Bankia's toxic real estate assets, including loans in and about to fall into arrears to housebuilders and repossessed property, totalled \u20ac32bn at the end of 2011. If it were an Irish bank, there is little doubt it would already be wholly nationalised and its worst performing loans split into a separate pool of toxic debt. But Bankia, like most of its banking rivals on the Iberian peninsula, has suffered while politicians have disguised the extent of their losses. The main shield for beleaguered Spanish banks is an opaque property market. Officially prices are 20% down from their peak \u2013 but the government bases its figures on valuations by the banks, which hold hundreds of thousands of repossessed properties on their books. Analysts have long argued that it is not in the banks' interests to depress the values of their own properties to match sale prices, which is the usual measure of a home's value. But there is no equivalent of the Halifax, Nationwide or even Land Registry monthly publications of sales data to provide a counterweight. A study last month by Pompeu Fabra University, commissioned by the Tecnocasa property group, found that house prices have fallen 41% since the peak. Similar studies have drawn the same conclusion. Meanwhile, official figures remain artificially high and protect the banks and building societies, known as cajas, from accepting they have an even bigger problem. The Irish government took the opposite view in 2010 when it became obvious a property building boom had wrecked the finances of its main banks. In September of that year, the Fianna F\u00e1il-led government nationalised Allied Irish, its second-largest bank and the fourth to be taken into public ownership. Toxic assets were separated into a National Asset Management Agency (Nama), which paid \u20ac32bn for a sprawling property and loans empire built up by the banks not only in Ireland, but across Europe and the US. Only this week the Irish Comptroller and Auditor General said in its second special report on Nama that it overpaid for the assets, which it argues are worth 75% of the original price. But the government took the view that the only way to restore confidence was to \"kitchen sink\" the bank's debts and guarantee to repay bondholders in full. Bondholders had provided loans to the banks, which were in turn loaned to developers. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan argues that the economy is moving again because international investors can see that the situation, while difficult, is transparent. But though exports are growing, the economy remains in recession and house prices have continued to fall. The most recent figures from the Central Statistics Office show prices were down 16.4% across the country in the year to April. The only ray of sunshine was a small rise in Dublin for the second month in a row, something that last happened in February 2007. The number of problem mortgages in Ireland has also jumped as falling house prices combine with stubbornly high unemployment to make the situation worse. More than one-in-seven Irish home loans are not being fully repaid in April and a total of 116,288 mortgages were either in arrears or had been restructured, up 8% compared with the start of the year. The lesson for the Spanish is that coming clean about Bankia's debts is the first step, but not the end of the story.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Leading index rises more than 80 points on week despite eurozone crisis continuing to unsettle investors", 
      "body": "<p>As leading shares recorded a weekly rise for the first time in a month despite the continuing eurozone crisis, City analysts were queuing up to give <strong>Aviva</strong> advice on how to improve its flagging business.</p> <p>The insurer parted company with chief executive Andrew Moss in early May after a shareholder rebellion over pay, and the City believes whoever takes over should make some radical moves, including floating some of its overseas businesses or asking shareholders for cash to boost the balance sheet. Analyst Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas said Aviva should package its Asian and European business, including Poland, together and split them off in a flotation which could be worth \u00a32bn. Hughes, who moved his recommendation on Aviva from underperform to outperform with a 331p price target, said:</p> <blockquote> [A flotation] of the combined businesses would give investors that value growth the opportunity to buy into the asset while allowing Aviva to repair capital buffers with limited impact on cash flows. While we still believe that consensus earnings forecasts are too optimistic and that the dividend will be cut, we also believe the stock is currently too cheap. The share is an attractive purchase going into [its 5 July] investor day, as market expectations appear to be very limited. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Canaccord Genuity issued a buy note on the business although it cut its price target from 410p to 320p. Analyst Ben Cohen suggested a 2 for 5 rights issue at 150p a share as one way of strengthening its capital base, as well as an exit from its US business and the sale of its remaining stake in Dutch subsidiary Delta Lloyd.</p> <p>Aviva edged up 0.4p to 268.4p but another insurer, motor specialist <strong>Admiral</strong>, was the leading riser up 32p at \u00a311.16. It benefited from figures showing a fall in whiplash claims in the UK the year to March following three years of increase. Exane analyst Hughes, who obtained the data, said:</p> <blockquote> Government action on referral fees paid to lawyers is due to come into force in April next year, so the decline in the year to March 2012 is a surprise. We expect this could be a result of increasing action from insurers in whiplash black spots to investigate fraudulent claims. </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished just 1.48 points higher at 5351.53.

      "bodyText": "As leading shares recorded a weekly rise for the first time in a month despite the continuing eurozone crisis, City analysts were queuing up to give Aviva advice on how to improve its flagging business. The insurer parted company with chief executive Andrew Moss in early May after a shareholder rebellion over pay, and the City believes whoever takes over should make some radical moves, including floating some of its overseas businesses or asking shareholders for cash to boost the balance sheet. Analyst Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas said Aviva should package its Asian and European business, including Poland, together and split them off in a flotation which could be worth \u00a32bn. Hughes, who moved his recommendation on Aviva from underperform to outperform with a 331p price target, said: [A flotation] of the combined businesses would give investors that value growth the opportunity to buy into the asset while allowing Aviva to repair capital buffers with limited impact on cash flows. While we still believe that consensus earnings forecasts are too optimistic and that the dividend will be cut, we also believe the stock is currently too cheap. The share is an attractive purchase going into [its 5 July] investor day, as market expectations appear to be very limited. Meanwhile Canaccord Genuity issued a buy note on the business although it cut its price target from 410p to 320p. Analyst Ben Cohen suggested a 2 for 5 rights issue at 150p a share as one way of strengthening its capital base, as well as an exit from its US business and the sale of its remaining stake in Dutch subsidiary Delta Lloyd. Aviva edged up 0.4p to 268.4p but another insurer, motor specialist Admiral, was the leading riser up 32p at \u00a311.16. It benefited from figures showing a fall in whiplash claims in the UK the year to March following three years of increase. Exane analyst Hughes, who obtained the data, said: Government action on referral fees paid to lawyers is due to come into force in April next year, so the decline in the year to March 2012 is a surprise. We expect this could be a result of increasing action from insurers in whiplash black spots to investigate fraudulent claims. Overall the FTSE 100 finished just 1.48 points higher at 5351.53. During the course of another uncertain week, the leading index managed to gain just over 80 points despite a number of negative developments.

We would IPO the growth businesses including Poland for \u00a32bn.  In our opinion the group should IPO the Asian and Eastern European operations which we believe generate little in the way of cash flow and capital. An IPO of the combined businesses would give investors that value growth the opportunity to buy into the asset while allowing Aviva to repair capital buffers with limited impact on cash flows. This can be used to reduce leverage, improving the rating agency metrics and increasing our stock valuation.
