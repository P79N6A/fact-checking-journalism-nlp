    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BHS believes it has secured the backing of major landlords for a vital vote this week that will determine the future of the 88-year-old department store chain. The retailer needs 75% of creditors to vote in favour of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) at a meeting on Wednesday or it will collapse into administration. However, even if the CVA is approved, BHS has warned that it needs extra funding to trade beyond 25 March and it is trying to raise \u00a3100m. The funding requirement highlights the challenge facing BHS, which employs 10,000 people and has 164 shops. However, Darren Topp, the BHS chief executive, said he is \u201cconfident but not complacent\u201d that creditors will back the CVA, a form of insolvency procedure. The CVA involves landlords agreeing to significant cuts to the rent on more than half of BHS\u2019s shops, with as many as 40 closing within weeks. However, one major landlord said BHS\u2019s proposal was \u201cnot stupid\u201d and he expected most landlords would support it. He said that a clause which gives landlords 180 days to decide if they want to take back premises where they have agreed to take a rental cut of 50% or 75% had provided reassurance. \u201cHow can you object to that?\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get the market rent but you are free to find your own solution and are getting some rent in the meantime.\u201d But another major landlord with fewer stores affected by the CVA said it had not decided on how it would vote. It told the Guardian: \u201cUsually with a CVA there is a sense of underlying problems, and when they have gone through before it has not staved off the inevitable.\u201d Ed Jenkins, head of UK retail at Standard Life Investments, another landlord, said: \u201cWe are in communication with BHS and their advisers KPMG on the status of the BHS store at Thistles shopping centre, Stirling. We are working to deliver the best long-term solution for both the centre and Stirling\u2019s overall retail offering.\u201d Hermes has already said it would vote against the proposals. Chris Taylor, head of private markets at Hermes, said: \u201cAs a responsible property investor focused on sustainable, long-term returns, we believe CVAs should be approached with caution. They have the potential to create unfair competition on the high street by prejudicing some retailers at the expense of others and compromising the position of landlords.\u201d BHS\u2019s biggest creditors \u2013 the Pension Protection Fund \u2013 could abstain from the vote. The PPF is set to take control of BHS\u2019s pension fund and its deficit of \u00a3571m, but is considering standing aside in the CVA vote to allow landlords to decide. Landlords are the only group of creditors that are being asked to make concessions in the CVA. A small number of votes have already been posted ahead of the meeting, and the majority are understood to back the CVA. Topp said: \u201cWe will be grateful if they do [approve it]. We believe we have a compelling story and a compelling turnaround. I think they [the creditors] do buy into it.\u201d BHS is also hoping to make an announcement this week about new funding. The CVA document reveals that it is trying to raise \u00a3100m. This includes a \u00a360m loan, likely to come from the restructuring firm Gordon Brothers, which will be secured against stock and debtors. However, BHS also wants to raise \u00a330m from property, either by selling sites, sub-letting them or raising loans against them. Its flagship shop on Oxford Street in London and a site in Milton Keynes are thought to be part of a deal. The final tranche of the \u00a3100m would come from the release of up to \u00a310m tied up with letters of credit and deposits held by suppliers. This cash was handed to BHS\u2019s suppliers after they had their credit insurance cut last year. Insurers who cover the possibility of a retailer going bust withdrew cover for BHS\u2019s suppliers, leaving them with no financial protection if the retailer collapsed before bills were paid. BHS said this had a \u201csubstantial negative impact\u201d on its financial resources. BHS is owned by Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known financiers, lawyers and accountants who bought the department store chain from Sir Philip Green for \u00a31 last year. Retail Acquisitions is led by Dominic Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt twice. The Guardian revealed earlier this month that Retail Acquisitions took a loan of \u00a38.4m out of BHS in the days following the takeover in March 2015. More than a third of the loan went to four directors of Retail Acquisitions, including Chappell. The retailer said the loan was for \u201cprofessional fees\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Soft drink makers are considering taking legal action against the government over its controversial sugar tax as George Osborne\u2019s budget shows further signs of unwinding. Suing the government is one option that companies are considering as they await more details on the tax, which will come into force in 2018 and cost \u00a31bn to implement, almost double the amount that it is expected to raise. The cost of the sugar tax has been revealed in documents published by the Office for Budget Responsibility alongside the budget. The extra cost will come from a predicted rise in accrued interest that the government will have to pay on debt that is linked to the rate of inflation. The new tax will add 24p a litre to soft drinks with the highest sugar content, a cost that could be passed on to shoppers through higher prices, meaning inflation would rise. The chancellor has predicted the tax will raise \u00a3520m in its first year, far less than the cost of introducing the levy. Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: \u201cThis just reaffirms our view that this tax is ill-considered. The evidence does not suggest it will be effective and taxpayers will be left paying a heavy price for it.\u201d The announcement of the sugar tax led to sharp falls in the share prices of major drinks companies, such as Britvic, the maker of Robinson, and AG Barr, the maker of Irn-Bru. The leading companies are now considering how to respond to the tax, with legal action against the government one option. The soft drink makers could sue the government through European courts on the basis that other types of food and drink \u2013 such as fruit juice and milkshakes \u2013 are not included. Similar taxes in Scandinavia have been successfully challenged. Partington added: \u201cAt this stage all options are on the table. We need clarification about how this tax is going to work, exactly what\u2019s excluded and what\u2019s not. Nothing can be ruled out at this stage.\u201d Coca-Cola also refused to rule out legal action. A Coca-Cola Great Britain spokesperson said: \u201cWe need to know more about the levy and how the government plans to implement it. Once this is clear to us, we\u2019ll decide on what steps to take as a business and how best to continue the work we have done to help people consume less sugar and calories from our drinks.\u201d However, the government defended the tax, claiming the chancellor was putting the next generation first, and that the soft drink makers had two years to cut the sugar content in their products. A HM Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cHe introduced a new levy on the soft drinks industry to pay for a doubling of dedicated sport funding for every primary school in the country, a huge expansion of breakfast clubs to ensure that every child gets the best start to the day, and new funding for a longer school day. \u201cThe chancellor also made clear that this was a policy aimed at driving meaningful change. The new levy will not be introduced until 2018, giving companies plenty of time to change product mix and reduce sugar content.\u201d",

The new levy will not be introduced until 2018, giving companies plenty of time to change product mix and reduce sugar content.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Farmers have called on retailers to do more to support the British lamb industry, with only one major supermarket chain selling entirely UK-grown lamb for Easter. A classic roast leg of lamb remains a popular family dish over the Easter holiday. However, despite industry efforts to reduce the amount of chilled and frozen lamb imported from New Zealand, only the German discount chain Aldi will sell entirely British-grown fresh lamb on a significant scale this Easter. Tesco, Lidl, Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s, Marks &amp; Spencer, the Co-op and Morrisons are all selling New Zealand lamb this Easter, typically topped up by small supplies of early season British lamb which is more expensive. The higher production costs associated with rearing lambs \u201cout of season\u201d, in indoor conditions in the winter months, mean it attracts a premium price. This is particularly relevant this year because Easter takes place earlier than in recent years. Tom Fullick, the National Farmers\u2019 Union\u2019s livestock adviser, said all retailers should make clear to farmers when they wanted to source from the UK, so they could plan their production cycle all year round if necessary. \u201cWe welcome this move by Aldi and we hope it will encourage other retailers to follow suit,\u201d he said. \u201cOur peak lambing season is March to May, but we can produce lambs earlier provided we get sufficient notice. If the supermarkets want it, we can produce it, but it\u2019s a lengthy planning cycle, and a consistent frustration for farmers is that labelling on sourcing is not clear enough for consumers.\u201d The UK is the world\u2019s third largest lamb exporter \u2013 after Australia and New Zealand \u2013 with just over a third of the market. According to retail analysts Mintec the peak for lamb consumption in the UK is typically in the month which Easter falls, with an average of almost 8,000 tonnes eaten. \u201cLamb is a dish for all year round,\u201d Fullick added. \u201cLamb gave turkey a run for its money in the run-up to the Christmas period and it actually outperformed turkey in value sales.\u201d Aldi\u2019s fresh whole leg of British Lamb will retail at just \u00a33.79 a kg, undercutting many competitors\u2019 half price Easter promotions on New Zealand imports. The German discounter \u2013 the UK\u2019s sixth largest supermarket \u2013 said its competitors relied solely or significantly upon imports from New Zealand for their Easter whole leg promotions, taking advantage of lower buying prices and greater availability. Tony Baines, joint managing director of corporate buying, said: \u201cAt Aldi, we pride ourselves on offering customers the best of British all year round. Our British Easter lamb proposition underpins our long term commitment to British farming and reinforces the fact that we will not be beaten on price.\u201d Kantar data revealed that Aldi has a 5.1% volume share of lamb across UK retailers, with sales growing at 36.5% over the quarter to the end of February. The Co-op is offering shoppers special offers on lamb for Easter, but all the cuts have been shipped in from New Zealand. Fresh legs of lamb are currently half price \u2013 now \u00a36.24 a kg \u2013 which will continue through Easter. A Co-op spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have been working hard with our farmers and suppliers and are really pleased that this year we are able to significantly increase the length of our British lamb season. We only replace British lamb with New Zealand during late winter/early Spring when British lamb is out of season.\u201d Morrisons is stocking 24 British lines of lamb and one imported line, for supply top-up reasons. But its Easter offer \u2013 \u00a34 a kg \u2013 is a leg of lamb from New Zealand, while its British lamb leg is only available from the meat counter and at \u00a310 a kg is not part of the offer. Lidl said it is committed to sourcing all its fresh listed lamb from British farmers from July until the end of the year, while it sells Scotch lamb all year round in Scotland. The Easter \u201cspecials\u201d it is currently promoting include a New Zealand lamb carvery leg (costing \u00a33.79 a kg but with no mention of New Zealand in current press adverts), a Deluxe West Country spatchcock lamb leg and a Deluxe prime Scotch rack of lamb. A spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are currently selling both British and New Zealand lamb in our UK stores, and are proud to report that we are experiencing the strongest year-on-year growth in fresh lamb sales within the UK retail sector, as reported by Kantar World Panel. We feel that this can only be a positive contribution to the British lamb industry and we will continue to support and champion British lamb farmers as much as we can.\u201d At Marks &amp; Spencer, New Zealand lamb will be sold alongside new season British lamb which will be going on sale from Wednesday, produced by a small number of selected farms in Lincolnshire, Derbyshire, Gloucestershire and Yorkshire and available only in selected stores. Anna Playfair-Hanney, agricultural expert at M&amp;S said: \u201cNew season British lamb is a lovely family tradition for Easter and we\u2019re delighted we\u2019re able to offer customers the first of the season just in time for Easter. Through our long-standing relationship with our famers, we are able to source our speciality range of UK lamb from some of the best suppliers in the country.\u201d Waitrose will be selling New Zealand lamb in pre-packs in its chiller section, while on its service meat counter it will stock British lamb from Dorset and the West Country, and Welsh lamb in Wales and Scotland. The UK\u2019s largest retailer Tesco, a major importer of New Zealand lamb, is working closely with UK farmers to increase its offering said it will next month launch a trial to develop a cost of production model for lamb, along of the lines of that in the dairy industry. A spokeswoman said: \u201cWhat we are looking at with this trial is not the short-term fix, but how we, farmers and processors can work together to help make sure we have a truly sustainable lamb industry in the future.\u201d \u2022 This article, and the subheading, was amended on 22 March 2016.

      "bodyText": "Britain faces a cocktail of economic risks. Such has been George Osborne\u2019s persistent message since the start of 2016. He talked about the slowdown in China. He fretted about the turmoil in financial markets. He warned that growth was still weak in the eurozone. What probably never crossed the chancellor\u2019s mind was that speculation over his own future might be part of the mix. There is no getting away from the fact that the budget and its aftermath have been a political and personal disaster for Osborne. Even while he was speaking, it was clear that the package would quickly fall to pieces. The budget could only make the sums add up through blatant accounting tricks. It announced tax cuts at the same time as it cut estimates for Britain\u2019s long-term growth potential. Even worse, it provided tax breaks for the better off at the same time as it targeted the disabled. The idea appears to have been to kick the can down the road until after the EU referendum on 23 June in the hope that the economic outlook will improve. Hence the pre-announced climbdown on reform of pension tax relief and the sop to the motoring lobby in the form of yet another freeze on excise duties for petrol and diesel. Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s resignation, followed by his equally dramatic appearance on the Andrew Marr Show, has left the idea of a three-month holding operation dead in the water. Osborne has been forced to retreat on the disability benefit cuts, he has been accused by Duncan Smith of a \u201cdeeply unfair\u201d budget, his accounting devices are seen as a bit rum even by his own fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), and there is now talk of him being moved to the Foreign Office in a post-referendum reshuffle. This is not simply a reprise of the pasty tax furore in the omnishambles budget of 2012 \u2013 it is far more serious. One reason is that IDS\u2019s main charge is correct. Osborne has made a fetish out of running a budget surplus by 2019-20, something for which there is no obvious economic rationale. He is seeking to do this whilst simultaneously reducing corporation tax, freezing excise duties on fuel, offering tax breaks to North Sea operators, and meeting Conservative manifesto pledges to increase the income tax personal allowance and the threshold at which people starting paying income tax at 40%. This is supposed to be achieved by a fresh onslaught against tax avoidance, an intensification of the squeeze on the running costs of Whitehall departments, and by taking the axe to the welfare bill. Because large chunks of public spending \u2013 the NHS, schools and overseas aid \u2013 are protected by a ring fence, that has left other government departments facing real inflation-adjusted cumulative cuts in their budgets between 2010-20 of a third or more. The cuts to the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and other unprotected departments would need to be even bigger were it not for the planned \u00a312bn reductions in welfare spending. But payments to pensioners account for around half the welfare bill and these too are ringfenced. Osborne\u2019s planned cuts amount to around 10% of the non-protected welfare bill and this cannot be done simply by removing benefits from those deemed by the chancellor to be feckless and workshy. It has not been possible for the Treasury to make the savings without targeting money spent helping the disabled. Osborne has now been ensnared by the political trap he imagined he was setting for others. He set himself the target of running a budget surplus because he thought it would entrench Labour\u2019s reputation as the party of deficit deniers, and he imposed a tough welfare cap to show that he supported the \u201cstrivers\u201d while the opposition supported \u201cshirkers\u201d. Pensioners were exempted from any cuts because they are more likely to vote Conservative than any other demographic group. Shares in Osborne peaked at the time of last summer\u2019s post-election budget but have been falling ever since. There was a brief period between early 2013 and 2015 when the economy appeared to be shaking off its post-Great Recession blues. Growth picked up, consumers had more money in their pockets and investment started to revive. Over the last few months it has become clear that this was a false dawn. Earnings growth remains stuck at around 2% and living standards are only rising because inflation is so weak. Growth is concentrated in the services sector, leaving the economy unbalanced. Most worryingly of all, Britain\u2019s productivity record remains wretched, which is why the OBR has cut its estimate of the economy\u2019s long-term growth potential. Osborne is not, of course, the first chancellor to find that solving Britain\u2019s structural weaknesses is a lot harder than it looks. Up until the budget, he could comfort himself in the knowledge that the economy was growing, per capita incomes were rising and that opinion polls suggested that voters were not clamouring for a change of government. Today the chancellor is a diminished figure. He has been damaged by the back-tracking on tax credits, pensions and now disability benefits. He continues to miss all his targets for deficit reduction. He has political plans to dish his opponents but no economic strategy worthy of the name. His fiscal jiggery-pokery has been fully exposed. Osborne\u2019s weakness presents a big problem for David Cameron. The prime minister knows that winning the referendum is not going to be easy. His pitch to voters is that Brexit is a leap into the economic unknown that is simply not worth the risk. Even the most passionate Brexit supporters admit that there would be short-term costs from leaving the EU. The pound would fall, shares would take a hammering, investment plans would be mothballed. What the \u201cleavers\u201d say, though, is that these are outweighed by the long-term advantages, and that making a decision on what might happen in the first two years after a leave vote would be like predicting the result of a football match after only 15 minutes had been played. The chancellor will play a pivotal role in the campaign. It is important for Cameron that Osborne is seen as believable. If the chancellor is not seen as credible on deficit reduction or the economy, then the danger is that he won\u2019t be seen as credible on the dangers of leaving the EU, either. Labour agrees with IDS about the unfairness of the budget. Indeed, that was precisely the point Jeremy Corbyn made when responding to Osborne last Wednesday. Given that the Conservative party is poised for its biggest schism since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, Cameron will need the support of the opposition leader and the votes of Labour supporters if he is to win the referendum. It is not obvious how Osborne\u2019s ideological and botched budget will help to secure them.",

This is not simply a reprise of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/28/george-osborne-u-turns-pasties-caravans\">pasty tax furore</a> in the omnishambles budget of 2012 \u2013 it is far more serious.</p> <p>One reason is that IDS\u2019s main charge is correct. Osborne has made a fetish out of running a budget surplus by 2019-20, something for which there is no obvious economic rationale. He is seeking to do this whilst simultaneously reducing corporation tax, freezing excise duties on fuel, offering tax breaks to North Sea operators, and meeting Conservative manifesto pledges to increase the income tax personal allowance and the threshold at which people starting paying income tax at 40%.</p> <p>This is supposed to be achieved by a fresh onslaught against tax avoidance, an intensification of the squeeze on the running costs of Whitehall departments, and by taking the axe to the welfare bill.</p> <p>Because large chunks of public spending \u2013 the NHS, schools and overseas aid \u2013 are protected by a ring fence, that has left other government departments facing real inflation-adjusted cumulative cuts in their budgets between 2010-20 of a third or more.</p> <p>The cuts to the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and other unprotected departments would need to be even bigger were it not for the planned \u00a312bn reductions in welfare spending. But payments to pensioners account for around half the welfare bill and these too are ringfenced. Osborne\u2019s planned cuts amount to around 10% of the non-protected welfare bill and this cannot be done simply by removing benefits from those deemed by the chancellor to be feckless and workshy. It has not been possible for the Treasury to make the savings without targeting money spent helping the disabled.</p> <p>Osborne has now been ensnared by the political trap he imagined he was setting for others. He set himself the target of running a budget surplus because he thought it would entrench Labour\u2019s reputation as the party of deficit deniers, and he imposed a tough welfare cap to show that he supported the \u201cstrivers\u201d while the opposition supported \u201cshirkers\u201d. Pensioners were exempted from any cuts because they are more likely to vote Conservative than any other demographic group.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/17/george-osborne-political-economic-climate-british-people-dont-love-conservatives\">If I were George Osborne I\u2019d be starting to sweat about Tory unpopularity | Martin Kettle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shares in Osborne peaked at the time of last summer\u2019s post-election budget but have been falling ever since. There was a brief period between early 2013 and 2015 when the economy appeared to be shaking off its post-Great Recession blues. Growth picked up, consumers had more money in their pockets and investment started to revive.</p> <p>Over the last few months it has become clear that this was a false dawn. Earnings growth remains stuck at around 2% and living standards are only rising because inflation is so weak. Growth is concentrated in the services sector, leaving the economy unbalanced. Most worryingly of all, Britain\u2019s productivity record remains wretched, which is why the OBR has cut its estimate of the economy\u2019s long-term growth potential.</p> <p>Osborne is not, of course, the first chancellor to find that solving Britain\u2019s structural weaknesses is a lot harder than it looks. Up until the budget, he could comfort himself in the knowledge that the economy was growing, per capita incomes were rising and that opinion polls suggested that voters were not clamouring for a change of government.</p> <p>Today the chancellor is a diminished figure. He has been damaged by the back-tracking on tax credits, pensions and now disability benefits. He continues to miss all his targets for deficit reduction. He has political plans to dish his opponents but no economic strategy worthy of the name. His fiscal jiggery-pokery has been fully exposed.</p> <p>Osborne\u2019s weakness presents a big problem for David Cameron. The prime minister knows that winning the referendum is not going to be easy. His pitch to voters is that Brexit is a leap into the economic unknown that is simply not worth the risk. <br></p> <p>Even the most passionate Brexit supporters admit that there would be short-term costs from leaving the EU. The pound would fall, shares would take a hammering, investment plans would be mothballed. What the \u201cleavers\u201d say, though, is that these are outweighed by the long-term advantages, and that making a decision on what might happen in the first two years after a leave vote would be like predicting the result of a football match after only 15 minutes had been played.</p> <p>The chancellor will play a pivotal role in the campaign. It is important for Cameron that Osborne is seen as believable. If the chancellor is not seen as credible on deficit reduction or the economy, then the danger is that he won\u2019t be seen as credible on the dangers of leaving the EU, either.</p> <p>Labour agrees with IDS about the unfairness of the budget. Indeed, that was precisely the point Jeremy Corbyn made when responding to Osborne last Wednesday. <br></p> <p>Given that the Conservative party is poised for its biggest schism since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, Cameron will need the support of the opposition leader and the votes of Labour supporters if he is to win the referendum. It is not obvious how Osborne\u2019s ideological and botched budget will help to secure them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Right inside the main door at Euclid Manor, there is a pile of shoes. Their owners are scattered throughout the 6,200 sq ft house in Oakland, California. There is music coming out of the kitchen where Sarah Cabell and Kailey-Jean Clark, two of the home\u2019s permanent residents, are preparing dinner for about 25 people, consisting of their roommates and friends. At the first sight, Euclid Manor doesn\u2019t look much different than any other home shared by friends. Yet, after looking closer, there are small details that stand out. On a door across from the entrance hangs a sign that reads: \u201cResidents only\u201d. The entrance itself has two small signs with instructions reminding everyone to lock up when they are coming and going. The reason: Euclid Manor is a communal living \u2013 or co-living \u2013 house. With wages stagnant and rents soaring, young people in New York, San Francisco and other hot (read expensive) cities are increasingly moving in with roommates. The number of 18- to 35-year-olds living with roommates has doubled since 1980. Young people have always needed housemates, especially when times are tough. But this time it\u2019s different. A new generation of co-living companies are trying to make shared housing a billion-dollar business. Euclid Manor is part of Open Door, a co-living company founded by Jay Standish, 31, and Ben Provan, 32. The pair run three co-living homes: the 5,600 sq ft Canopy, home to 12 housemates, the 6,200 sq ft Farmhouse, home to 16 people, and Euclid Manor, where they moved in back in July. Euclid Manor is currently home to eight permanent residents, which will eventually rise to 10. The houses self-manage, with Provan and Standish stepping in for conflict resolution if needed. Ideally, the houses should be \u201cself-running, self-sufficient organisms\u201d with different members of the house taking on different tasks and roles. \u201cBeing in a community is like being in a relationship, it does take work and it takes good communications and you have to be proactive,\u201d says Standish. \u201cThere are many benefits with having that lifestyle. And, who would want to live their life alone?\u201d In Brooklyn, at two co-living homes run by Common, another co-living company, the menial tasks of living with others, such as buying the toilet paper, buying furniture or cleaning the communal spaces once a week, are all handled by the company. Brad Hargreaves, 29, got the idea for Common while running General Assembly, a global education company. Students and instructors at GA lived with roommates in expensive cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, but their homes were not designed with roommates in mind. Co-living companies like Common, Open Door and Pure House are looking to change that. \u201cThe biggest misunderstanding of co-living is people think it\u2019s this totally new crazy and radical thing. It\u2019s not. People have been living with roommates for a really long time. That\u2019s how so many people in cities live,\u201d says Hargreaves. \u201cReally what we are doing is just taking this way of living and making it better, designing an experience for what people are already doing.\u201d Also trying to break into co-living is WeWork, the staggeringly valued property manager. The landlord to a new generation of tech startups (and the Guardian\u2019s New York office) is hoping to justify its $16bn valuation by making it big in co-living with WeLive. Their model \u2013 call it dorm 2.0 \u2013 is to rent space from a landlord, convert it to cookie-cutter bedrooms that come with access to shared common space \u2013 to foster a feeling of community \u2013 and rent them out to members on a month-to-month basis. An investor presentation leaked online last year estimated that by 2018 WeLive would pull in $636m and earlier this year, Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork, confirmed to the Guardian that he expects WeLive to have as many as 34,000 members. WeWork would not comment for this story except to say it is \u201cin the early stages of beta-testing a new, community-driven living concept in New York City\u201d and is listening to the feedback from its community. The first co-living space, where about 80 WeWork employees and members are living in 45 apartments, is located at 110 Wall Street and is expected to house 600 people on 20 floors. For some, those kind of numbers and cookie-cutter room design bring to mind adult dorms, but those who have experienced communal living dislike that label. The word dorm has \u201ca negative connotation once you are over the age of 20,\u201d says Ash, 28, who lives at Common\u2019s second building in Brooklyn. The house he lives in \u2013 with 10 bedrooms, starting at $1,500 a month \u2013 is far from a dorm, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like moving into a building where you know people are friendly already. You used to move into an apartment building and it was this awkward period where you had to walk around and knock on doors and meet people and make friends that way,\u201d he says. \u201cThis takes out that aspect of it. It doesn\u2019t take out any of the privacy or of having the apartment, it just takes away the awkwardness of meeting people in the big city.\u201d The co-living homes are not party houses or packed with the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and coders, who hang around the house all day with their computers. Ash used to work in oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico until the price of oil went down and he was laid off. He now works in fiber optics. \u201cLooking at our membership, at least 80% of them have full-time jobs in [New York] city,\u201d says Hargreaves. \u201cThese are generally not people working from home.\u201d Common\u2019s next project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, consists of four five-story buildings connected to create a 20,000 sq ft space with 51 bedrooms. Most of the apartments will consist of four bedrooms, two bathrooms and one kitchen-living area. The members will also have access to communal space in the basement and the rooftop. The space is set to open later this spring with bedrooms starting at $1,800 a month for a 12-month commitment. Tiered pricing will be available for six-, three- and one-month stays. Whether the sense of community and friendliness can be replicated in that large a space remains to be seen. With the insatiable demand for housing in areas like New York and San Francisco, scaling up \u2013 going bigger \u2013 can be tempting. \u201cWe have seen huge demand,\u201d says Hargreaves, pointing out that Common had received \u201cover 2,000 applications for our first 30 spots at this point\u201d. Yet, he warns, co-living companies that grow too fast do so at their own peril. For example, the now-defunct Campus \u2013 one of the first co-living startups that, according to Hargreaves, was \u201ca lot more aggressive with their expansion\u201d. Campus shuttered its 30 co-living houses in August 2015 leaving about 150 people in New York and San Francisco having to find a new home. In a message posted on the company website, Tom Currier, Campus founder, wrote that he was \u201cunable to make Campus into an economically viable business\u201d. With the help of investors and developers who are hoping to break into the \u201croommate\u201d market, some of the co-living companies are attempting to perfect their business model and scale it. Common raised $7.35m last summer for its expansion. At Euclid Manor, Open Door founders are also working with investors. \u201cEssentially, we have spent two years perfecting the model and improving our track record,\u201d says Standish. \u201cWe understand all the details of how co-living works on the ground. We can consult with the developers and help them reality-check the building because we know how it works.\u201d In the future, the Open Door founders would like to partner with developers on new ground-up projects \u2013 similarly to the way that Common has on its 51-bedroom location in Williamsburg. \u201cIt\u2019s about being able to fully customize the program and layout of the building for co-living,\u201d explains Provan. \u201cUsing the existing mansions, you are kind of working with an imperfect product and layout and after the fact changing it to co-living.\u201d Before Euclid Manor was a co-living space, it was a bed and breakfast. Each room has its own feel and reflects the personality of its occupant. According to Provan, the more companies do co-living the better, since each space and attendant services might appeal to a different group of people. Co-living is so hot now, interest rates are so low, rents are so high \u2013 all the factors seem to be in the new landlords\u2019 favor but will all the competition and hype build a new housing bubble? \u201cI\u2019m not worried [about competition],\u201d says Hargreaves. \u201cAnything that brings more housing on to the market in an incredibly housing crunched city is a positive thing. The only way that we might harm each other as competitors is if we both brought so much inventory on to the market that we were forced to lower our prices in order to compete. And you know if [Common] and WeWork going at it has such an effect that it lowers the cost of living in New York City, wouldn\u2019t that be a thing? Wouldn\u2019t that be awesome?\u201d he adds, smiling.",

The number of 18- to 35-year-olds living with roommates has doubled since 1980. Young people have always needed housemates, especially when times are tough. But this time it\u2019s different. A new generation of co-living companies are trying to make shared housing a billion-dollar business. </p> <p>Euclid Manor is part of <a href=\"http://opendoor.io/\">Open Door</a>, a co-living company founded by Jay Standish, 31, and Ben Provan, 32. The pair run three co-living homes: the 5,600 sq ft <a href=\"http://opendoor.io/portfolio/the-canopy/\">Canopy</a>, home to 12 housemates, the 6,200 sq ft <a href=\"http://opendoor.io/portfolio/the-farmhouse/\">Farmhouse</a>, home to 16 people, and <a href=\"http://opendoor.io/euclid-manor/\">Euclid Manor</a>, where they moved in back in July.

Students and instructors at GA lived with roommates in expensive cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, but their homes were not designed with roommates in mind.<em> </em></p> <p>Co-living companies like Common, Open Door and <a href=\"http://purehouse.org/#welcome-home\">Pure House</a> are looking to change that. </p> <p>\u201cThe biggest misunderstanding of co-living is people think it\u2019s this totally new crazy and radical thing. It\u2019s not. People have been living with roommates for a really long time. That\u2019s how so many people in cities live,\u201d says Hargreaves. \u201cReally what we are doing is just taking this way of living and making it better, designing an experience for what people are already doing.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9653c7ee8f9b8638ef1da6f90b8b4491974aa63b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9653c7ee8f9b8638ef1da6f90b8b4491974aa63b/0_510_3683_2209/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Co-Founders Ben Provan, left, and Jay Standish, right, greet guests as they arrive for dinner at Euclid Manor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Co-Founders Ben Provan, left, and Jay Standish, right, greet guests as they arrive for dinner at Euclid Manor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also trying to break into co-living is WeWork, the staggeringly valued property manager. The landlord to a new generation of tech startups (and the Guardian\u2019s New York office) is hoping to justify its $16bn valuation by making it big in co-living with WeLive. Their model \u2013 call it dorm 2.0 \u2013 is to rent space from a landlord, convert it to cookie-cutter bedrooms that come with access to shared common space \u2013 to foster a feeling of community \u2013 and rent them out to members on a month-to-month basis.</p> <p>An investor presentation leaked online last year estimated that by 2018 WeLive would pull in $636m and earlier this year, Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2016/jan/11/wework-transforming-office-life-and-home-life-carole-cadwalladr\">confirmed to the Guardian</a> that he expects WeLive to have as many as 34,000 members.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e01383f2810d9aa472c87a1710b871e8a3780a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e01383f2810d9aa472c87a1710b871e8a3780a2/0_114_1116_669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photo of a WeLive bedroom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photo of a WeLive bedroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of WeWork</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>WeWork would not comment for this story except to say it is \u201cin the early stages of beta-testing a new, community-driven living concept in New York City\u201d and is listening to the feedback from its community. The first co-living space, where about 80 WeWork employees and members are living in 45 apartments, is located at 110 Wall Street and is expected to house 600 people on 20 floors.</p> <p>For some, those kind of numbers and cookie-cutter room design bring to mind adult dorms, but those who have experienced communal living dislike that label. </p> <p>The word dorm has \u201ca negative connotation once you are over the age of 20,\u201d says Ash, 28, who lives at Common\u2019s second building in Brooklyn. The house he lives in \u2013 with 10 bedrooms, starting at $1,500 a month \u2013 is far from a dorm, he says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like moving into a building where you know people are friendly already. You used to move into an apartment building and it was this awkward period where you had to walk around and knock on doors and meet people and make friends that way,\u201d he says. \u201cThis takes out that aspect of it. It doesn\u2019t take out any of the privacy or of having the apartment, it just takes away the awkwardness of meeting people in the big city.\u201d</p> <p>The co-living homes are not party houses or packed with the Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and coders, who hang around the house all day with their computers. Ash used to work in oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico until the price of oil went down and he was laid off. He now works in fiber optics. </p> <p>\u201cLooking at our membership, at least 80% of them have full-time jobs in [New York] city,\u201d says Hargreaves. \u201cThese are generally not people working from home.\u201d</p> <p>Common\u2019s next project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, consists of four five-story buildings connected to create a 20,000 sq ft space with 51 bedrooms. Most of the apartments will consist of four bedrooms, two bathrooms and one kitchen-living area. The members will also have access to communal space in the basement and the rooftop. The space is set to open later this spring with bedrooms starting at $1,800 a month for a 12-month commitment. Tiered pricing will be available for six-, three- and one-month stays. </p> <p>Whether the sense of community and friendliness can be replicated in that large a space remains to be seen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52f0519451c5fc9e308fe42f66be0e7d89da1189\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52f0519451c5fc9e308fe42f66be0e7d89da1189/0_47_1024_615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A bedroom at Common building in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A bedroom at Common building in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Common</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With the insatiable demand for housing in areas like New York and San Francisco, scaling up \u2013 going bigger \u2013 can be tempting.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen huge demand,\u201d says Hargreaves, pointing out that Common had received \u201cover 2,000 applications for our first 30 spots at this point\u201d.</p> <p>Yet, he warns, co-living companies that grow too fast do so at their own peril. For example, the now-defunct Campus \u2013 one of the first co-living startups that, according to Hargreaves, was \u201ca lot more aggressive with their expansion\u201d.</p> <p>Campus shuttered its 30 co-living houses in August 2015 leaving about 150 people in New York and San Francisco having to find a new home.</p> <p>In a message posted on the company website, Tom Currier, Campus founder, wrote that he was \u201cunable to make Campus into an economically viable business\u201d.</p> <p>With the help of investors and developers who are hoping to break into the \u201croommate\u201d market, some of the co-living companies are attempting to perfect their business model and scale it. Common raised $7.35m last summer for its expansion. At Euclid Manor, Open Door founders are also working with investors. </p> <p>\u201cEssentially, we have spent two years perfecting the model and improving our track record,\u201d says Standish. \u201cWe understand all the details of how co-living works on the ground. We can consult with the developers and help them reality-check the building because we know how it works.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e749efea33cb59ec90645a39704e0ed8ba7ab14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e749efea33cb59ec90645a39704e0ed8ba7ab14/0_0_4744_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Euclid Manor is a 6,200 sq ft co-living house with eight roommates in Oakland, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Euclid Manor is a 6,200 sq ft co-living house with eight permanent roommates in Oakland, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Josh Edelson for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the future, the Open Door founders would like to partner with developers on new ground-up projects \u2013 similarly to the way that Common has on its 51-bedroom location in Williamsburg. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about being able to fully customize the program and layout of the building for co-living,\u201d explains Provan. \u201cUsing the existing mansions, you are kind of working with an imperfect product and layout and after the fact changing it to co-living.\u201d</p> <p>Before Euclid Manor was a co-living space, it was a bed and breakfast. Each room has its own feel and reflects the personality of its occupant. </p> <p>According to Provan, the more companies do co-living the better, since each space and attendant services might appeal to a different group of people. </p> <p>Co-living is so hot now, interest rates are so low, rents are so high \u2013 all the factors seem to be in the new landlords\u2019 favor but will all the competition and hype build a new housing bubble? </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried [about competition],\u201d says Hargreaves.</p> <p> \u201cAnything that brings more housing on to the market in an incredibly housing crunched city is a positive thing. The only way that we might harm each other as competitors is if we both brought so much inventory on to the market that we were forced to lower our prices in order to compete. And you know if [Common] and WeWork going at it has such an effect that it lowers the cost of living in New York City, wouldn\u2019t that be a thing? Wouldn\u2019t that be awesome?\u201d he adds, smiling. </p> <p> </p>",

      "bodyText": "With the temperatures warming up, Next will be feeling more heat than usual when it unveils annual results on Thursday. The weather has caused the occasional blip but Next has had a remarkable record in the past five years, overtaking Marks &amp; Spencer as Britain\u2019s leading clothes retailer as sales and profits rose. The share price more than tripled in that time and Next\u2019s boss, Simon Wolfson, was feted as a supreme retailer. But Next unnerved investors in early January with disappointing pre-Christmas sales that it blamed largely on the warmest December on record. Lord Wolfson also mentioned increased competition online and poor product availability at the Next Directory catalogue business. Tony Shiret, the veteran retail analyst, distilled concerns last week in a 26-page note that argued Next\u2019s problems were more deep-rooted than they seemed. Shiret has argued for two years that the directory relies too much on customers who buy on credit and he now thinks the most profitable of those customers are spending less. The full effects won\u2019t be felt for some time and Wolfson is clever enough to find ways to arrest the decline, but \u201cwe are just at the start of the pressure on Next\u2019s UK Directory business\u201d, Shiret concluded. That\u2019s just one analyst\u2019s view: but it raises questions for Wolfson on results day. George and Boris face a tour around Europe An email headed \u201cmeetings of the Treasury committee\u201d is always worth clicking, and so it proved on Friday. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie and his gang are to question George Osborne and Boris Johnson this week on \u201cthe economic and financial costs and benefits of UK\u2019s EU membership\u201d. There\u2019s been a great deal of heat but not much light so far in the referendum campaign, with all sorts of flaky claims made about the consequences of staying in and leaving. So putting these two on the spot to extract their version of the facts is a good thing in itself. But the sessions \u2013 Wednesday for Johnson, Thursday for Osborne \u2013 are much more than that. Each will in effect be pitching for the Tory leadership and, after the disastrous budget and climbdown on disability benefit cuts, Osborne will be trying to cling to his job. Don\u2019t be surprised if some members depart from the EU script and seek to exert political pressure on the chancellor. Osborne\u2019s problems take some of the pressure off Johnson, who might have been the star. But MPs need to get behind the London mayor\u2019s largely unfunny routine and ask hard questions about his late conversion to leaving the EU. Bonjour, M de Rivaz.

Why haven\u2019t you signed it and when will you? \u25a0 When did your finance director resign, is it true that he left because of Hinkley Point and how does the fog surrounding his departure fit with your promise of a new era of transparency for nuclear power? \u25a0 Why should we expect you to build Hinkley Point on time and to budget when you have overrun by years on smaller projects in France and Finland? \u25a0 Who is getting the best deal, EDF or UK consumers on the hook to pay you more than double the current cost of wholesale electricity? \u25a0 Who is making the decisions, EDF or the French government in concert with the UK? \u25a0 If you knew what you know now, would you ever have agreed to build Hinkley Point?",

The weather has caused the occasional blip but Next has had a remarkable record in the past five years, overtaking Marks &amp; Spencer as Britain\u2019s leading clothes retailer as sales and profits rose. The share price more than tripled in that time and Next\u2019s boss, Simon Wolfson, was feted as a supreme retailer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/07/next-investors-critical-over-dividend-disclosure\">Investors in Next critical over dividend disclosure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Next unnerved investors in early January <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/05/next-reports-disappointing-christmas-after-mild-autumn\" title=\"\">with disappointing pre-Christmas sales</a> that it blamed largely on the warmest December on record. Lord Wolfson also mentioned increased competition online and poor product availability at the Next Directory catalogue business.</p> <p>Tony Shiret, the veteran retail analyst, distilled concerns last week in a 26-page note that argued Next\u2019s problems were more deep-rooted than they seemed. Shiret has argued for two years that the directory relies too much on customers who buy on credit and he now thinks the most profitable of those customers are spending less. The full effects won\u2019t be felt for some time and Wolfson is clever enough to find ways to arrest the decline, but \u201cwe are just at the start of the pressure on Next\u2019s UK Directory business\u201d, Shiret concluded. That\u2019s just one analyst\u2019s view: but it raises questions for Wolfson on results day.</p> <h2>George and Boris face a tour around Europe</h2> <p>An email headed \u201cmeetings of the Treasury committee\u201d is always worth clicking, and so it proved on Friday. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie and his gang are to question George Osborne and Boris Johnson this week on \u201cthe economic and financial costs and benefits of UK\u2019s EU membership\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s been a great deal of heat but not much light so far in the referendum campaign, with all sorts of flaky claims made about the consequences of staying in and leaving. So putting these two on the spot to extract their version of the facts is a good thing in itself.</p> <p>But the sessions \u2013 Wednesday for Johnson, Thursday for Osborne \u2013 are much more than that. Each will in effect be pitching for the Tory leadership and, after the disastrous budget and climbdown on disability benefit cuts, Osborne will be trying to cling to his job. Don\u2019t be surprised if some members depart from the EU script and seek to exert political pressure on the chancellor. Osborne\u2019s problems take some of the pressure off Johnson, who might have been the star. But MPs need to get behind the London mayor\u2019s largely unfunny routine and ask hard questions about his late conversion to leaving the EU.</p> <h2>Bonjour, M de Rivaz.

      "bodyText": "It would be interesting to know if George Osborne, while preparing last week\u2019s budget, had time to see the first instalment of Norma Percy\u2019s television series on the Obama White House. If so he might have been reminded of something historically interesting, namely a matter about which the chancellor, who fancies himself as a historian, has not been straight with the public. More or less from his arrival in the Oval Office in 2009, Barack Obama\u2019s first year was dominated by the financial crisis. And, curious though it may seem to the many who have swallowed Osborne\u2019s propaganda, the banking crisis in the US, rather like the banking crisis in the rest of the developed world, was not caused by Labour. But not only did the wily Osborne propagate the myth that the crisis in Britain was solely the result of a Labour spending programme (of which even he himself had approved), he also made the categorical error of comparing Britain\u2019s economic problems at the time with those of Greece. While the Treasury traditionally favours cutting public spending, I doubt that even the Treasury, while backing Osborne\u2019s austerity programme, bought its master\u2019s analogy with Greece. Osborne made a political choice, and it is impossible to assess his subsequent record properly without bearing this in mind. This applies as much to last week\u2019s budget as to all the previous ones, starting with the austerity budget of July 2010, when he introduced a series of tax increases and public spending cuts which stopped the post-2009 recovery in its tracks. The chancellor always presents his budgets as part of his \u201clong-term plan\u201d, though most observers know that his real long-term plan is to succeed David Cameron. Until recently Osborne\u2019s reputation was riding high, with many political commentators comparing his tactics to those of Gordon Brown, whose every move he is supposed to have learned from. Most have suggested that this budget was more of a short-term plan, to smooth the path to the EU referendum. One tactic was to offer tax cuts to the many Tories and businesspeople who are Eurosceptics. But tax cuts for the relatively well off, and harsh treatment of the less fortunate, have been at the core of Osborne\u2019s longer-term austerity strategy. In proposals for harsher treatment of the disabled in a budget concentrating tax concessions principally on the upper echelons of taxpayers, we saw the epitome of Osborne\u2019s social strategy. But this blatant insensitivity appears to have proved too much for his own backbenchers \u2013 and now even for Iain Duncan Smith. Meanwhile, in being widely castigated for his failure to achieve his targets for a \u201cwelfare cap\u201d and reining back borrowing and the size of the national debt, Osborne is being hoist by his own petard. At which point it is important to remember that two prominent modern institutions seldom out of the political and economic news are themselves a reaction to the traditional tendency for chancellors to play fast and loose. Thus the setting up of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, introduced by Gordon Brown, also reflected an Establishment desire to stop chancellors from announcing what were regarded as purely political cuts in interest rates. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was aimed at preventing them \u201cleaning on\u201d the official forecasters. It is important to remember the OBR is not responsible for the budget, but it is responsible for setting the framework. The big news last week was how, within months of the autumn statement, the \u00a327bn of fiscal freedom announced by the OBR had been recalculated as a \u00a356bn \u201cblack hole\u201d. Now the chancellor has made great play with \u201cthe cocktail of risks\u201d sighted in the world economy since November, but as the OBR states in its Economic and Fiscal Outlook: \u201cThe most significant forecast change we have made since November has been to revise down productivity growth. This is the amount of output the economy can produce sustainably per hour worked and is a key driver of its potential size.\u201d On top of the constraints imposed on chancellors by the MPC and the OBR, Osborne, in his passion for shrinking the size of the state while cutting taxes for the better off, created his own constraint with debt and deficit targets. I am reminded of the monetarist early 1980s, when the then governor of the Bank of England, Gordon Richardson, told me that, with his monetary rules, the then chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe had \u201ccreated a rod for his own back\u201d. Osborne should have learnt from Brown\u2019s experience that \u201crules\u201d, golden or otherwise, can, like Macbeth\u2019s \u201cbloody instructions\u201d, return to plague the inventor. The Institute of Fiscal Studies is scathing about his juggling with the figures. The chancellor ought to have paid more attention to the trade deficit. Both the Treasury Red Book and the OBR report contain worrying passages about our trading performance and the balance of overseas payments. The world trade picture is so disturbing that even the IMF and OECD have urged combined G20 action on the fiscal front as quantitative easing reaches its limits \u2013 illustrated, to my personal cost, at Cheltenham last week when the horse Quantitative Easing put up a brave show but was unplaced. Osborne\u2019s austerity strategy was an expensive mistake and almost certainly contributed to the deterioration in the economy\u2019s productivity. William Hill say that bets on Osborne to succeed Cameron have been conspicuously rare since Wednesday\u2019s budget. As Gordon Brown joked: \u201cThere are two kinds of chancellor. Those whose careers end in failure and those who get out in time.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London\u2019s economy may be famously buoyant, but the Square Mile that has fuelled its prosperity is signally failing to create jobs for the capital\u2019s young people. A report to be published this week warns of problems ahead if the City does not act soon to help create opportunities for London\u2019s young unemployed. The study, from the City of London Corporation, the municipal governing body, states that nearly one in five young Londoners is now unemployed. Even though the capital generates almost a quarter of the UK\u2019s wealth, it has England\u2019s third highest rate of unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds. The findings echo those in a report in December, published by the New Policy Institute, which revealed that unemployment in London is two-and-a-half times higher for 16- to 24-year-olds than for those aged 25-64. The corporation\u2019s report is expected to claim that a continued failure to harness the economic dynamism of the capital and create jobs will lead to further exclusion and disadvantage among the young. Backed by senior figures from City businesses, voluntary groups and local authorities, the report will challenge businesses across the capital to do more to prevent young people \u201cfalling through the net\u201d, and will claim that they face a growing skills gap in the years ahead unless the \u201cdisconnect\u201d between their needs and the training given to the young jobless is bridged. The lord mayor of London, Jeffrey Mountevans, has recently called for businesses to provide more mentoring, work-experience schemes and apprenticeships. But the report will make clear that there are significant barriers facing unemployed young people hoping to get on to such schemes. Figures provided by the Sutton Trust show that it costs \u00a3926 a month for someone to undertake an unpaid internship \u2013 putting the positions out of reach of many families. A spokesman for the corporation said: \u201cWe have a responsibility to create a more fair, inclusive and sustainable society. We also want businesses where responsibility is central to all their decisions, all their activities and all their workers at all levels.\u201d The City\u2019s leading financial firms are regularly attacked for paying their executives massive bonuses while failing to invest in junior staff. Earlier this year Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused City bankers of treating ordinary workers like a \u201ccash cow\u201d. Clare McNeil, associate director of work, families and security at the Institute for Public Policy Research, said 18% of young Londoners were unable to find work, compared with a national average of 15%, in part because London has a more competitive jobs market. But she also said the capital was lagging when it came to providing workplace schemes. \u201cIn terms of apprenticeships, the capital performs quite poorly,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cThere is a lower participation in apprenticeships by employers than elsewhere in the UK. And while nearly half of internships are based in London, research points to the fact that it does tend to be those who are better connected who get them.\u201d A failure to find jobs for the younger generation will store up a host of socioeconomic problems, she suggested. \u201cThe longer it takes you to get a foothold in the labour market, the more of an impact it has on your future earnings,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cPeople in their 20s and 30s are not able to catch up with older generations in terms of their earnings potential, so there\u2019s an economic impact. But there\u2019s a wider social impact, too. Younger people will become more disengaged, and that has all sorts of societal implications. Many people have made the link between the London riots and high levels of youth unemployment.\u201d",

Even though the capital generates almost a quarter of the UK\u2019s wealth, it has England\u2019s third highest rate of unemployment among 16- to 24-year-olds.</p> <p>The findings echo those in a report in December, published by the New Policy Institute, which revealed that unemployment in London is two-and-a-half times higher for 16- to 24-year-olds than for those aged 25-64.</p> <p>The corporation\u2019s report is expected to claim that a continued failure to harness the economic dynamism of the capital and create jobs will lead to further exclusion and disadvantage among the young.</p> <p>Backed by senior figures from City businesses, voluntary groups and local authorities, the report will challenge businesses across the capital to do more to prevent young people \u201cfalling through the net\u201d, and will claim that they face a growing skills gap in the years ahead unless the \u201cdisconnect\u201d between their needs and the training given to the young jobless is bridged.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.gresham.ac.uk/professors-and-speakers/the-rt-hon-the-lord-mayor-of-the-city-of-london-the-lord-mountevans\" title=\"\">lord mayor of London, Jeffrey Mountevans</a>, has recently called for businesses to provide more mentoring, work-experience schemes and apprenticeships. But the report will make clear that there are significant barriers facing unemployed young people hoping to get on to such schemes.</p> <p>Figures provided by the Sutton Trust show that it costs \u00a3926 a month for someone to undertake an unpaid internship \u2013 putting the positions out of reach of many families.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Younger people will become more disengaged. Many people have made the link between the London riots and unemployment</p> <footer> <cite>Clare McNeil, IPPR</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A spokesman for the corporation said: \u201cWe have a responsibility to create a more fair, inclusive and sustainable society. We also want businesses where responsibility is central to all their decisions, all their activities and all their workers at all levels.\u201d</p> <p>The City\u2019s leading financial firms are regularly attacked for paying their executives massive bonuses while failing to invest in junior staff. Earlier this year Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused City bankers of treating ordinary workers like a \u201ccash cow\u201d.</p> <p>Clare McNeil, associate director of work, families and security at the <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org\" title=\"\">Institute for Public Policy Research</a>, said 18% of young Londoners were unable to find work, compared with a national average of 15%, in part because London has a more competitive jobs market.</p> <p>But she also said the capital was lagging when it came to providing workplace schemes. \u201cIn terms of apprenticeships, the capital performs quite poorly,\u201d McNeil said. \u201cThere is a lower participation in apprenticeships by employers than elsewhere in the UK. And while nearly half of internships are based in London, research points to the fact that it does tend to be those who are better connected who get them.\u201d</p> <p>A failure to find jobs for the younger generation will store up a host of socioeconomic problems, she suggested. \u201cThe longer it takes you to get a foothold in the labour market, the more of an impact it has on your future earnings,\u201d McNeil said.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in their 20s and 30s are not able to catch up with older generations in terms of their earnings potential, so there\u2019s an economic impact. But there\u2019s a wider social impact, too. Younger people will become more disengaged, and that has all sorts of societal implications. Many people have made the link between the London riots and high levels of youth unemployment.\u201d</p>",
