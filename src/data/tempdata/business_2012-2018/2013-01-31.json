      "bodyText": "That's it for another day of our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. A quick re-cap of today's main talking points: Allegations of bribery and corruption rocked Spain's ruling People's Party Prosecutors in Italy have launched an investigation into lender Monte Paschi's past over allegations of irregularities, while the Bank of Italy will be investigated into whether it turned a blind eye during Mario Draghi's time running the central bank. US jobless figures come in higher than expected Cyprus' banks are downgraded Tomorrow, all eyes will be on the US again, when the non-farm job figures are released. These are private sector jobs and should give a better indication as to whether America is on its way to recovery. Eurozone unemployment figures for December are released, along with January inflation rates And manufacturing PMI figures for Italy, France, Germany, Norway and Switzerland are expected Thanks for all your contributions and debate. See you tomorrow. Our business correspondent in New York, Dominic Rushe, has written on the latest jobless figures out of the US, with 38,000 extra Americans out of work, bringing the total to 368,000. He said: The rise was higher than the 365,000 figure forecast by economists, but the jobs market still appears to be slowly recovering. Claims above 400,000 signal a deteriorating jobs market. The latest weekly figures come ahead of Friday's monthly non-farm figures, which give a far more comprehensive picture of the US jobs market. You can read the full article here Maybe not revelation of the day, but certainly interesting... And with the close of today's markets, it marks the end of Spain's ban on short-selling stocks and bonds which had been in place since July. From tomorrow, bets against Spain's future will be taken once again. FTSE 100 down 21 at 6302 DAX down 20 at 7791 CAC down 19 at 3747 IBEX down 203 at 8369 FTSE MIB up 149 at 17439 Fitch ratings agency has downgraded the Bank of Cyprus, Cyprus Popular bank and Hellenic bank from BB- to B following a downgrading of the country's sovereign rating last week. Earlier this month Moody's slashed its rating on Cyprus by three notches to Caa3 \u2013 just three above outright default \u2013 with a negative outlook, and warned that the country's debt burden will rise sharply. Details for a refinancing programme by the Cyprus government has still not been agreed and clearly the agencies are losing patience. Back to Spain. After dismissing the revelations of alleged tax dodging, bribery and corruption, Spain's ruling party will hold crisis talks shortly. Jose Miguel Sardo tweets: Meanwhile, over in Rome, prosecutors have started an investigation into suspected market manipulation related to the Monte dei Paschi di Siena bank, after a consumer rights association appealed to investigators. The bank is accused of having overpaid for a \u20ac9bn purchase of rival Antonveneta in 2007, stretching its finances to the limits, and of having made risky derivatives trades in 2006-2009 aimed at massaging its accounts. Prosecutors are investigating whether bribes were paid at the time the bank bought Antonveneta. They also suspect fraud was involved in the derivatives deals which could cost the bank \u20ac720m. The Bank of Italy, which ECB boss Mario Draghi ran until 2011, is also under fire for not summoning the bank's management until late 2011, despite knowing about the problems in 2009. Our correspondent in Madrid, Giles Tremlett sums up the revelations spewing out of Spain today. He writes Today's revelations in El Pa\u00eds newspaper of a double-accounting system that allegedly ran until recently in Spain's ruling People's party (PP) raises the awful spectre that those who are now busy hiking taxes and cutting spending are tax cheats. While the documents published by El Pa\u00eds refer to the period between 1997 and 2008, and the party has reportedly since cleaned up its act, they suggest that a cash-in-hand payment system saw money moving beyond the reach of tax authorities. And while it has not been proved that the individuals named in the alleged accounts, including the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, the party general secretary, Mar\u00eda Dolores de Cospedal, and the former IMF boss Rodrigo Rato, really did receive the money (or fail to pay taxes on it if they did), the PP is already so deep in corruption scandals that ordinary Spaniards may have trouble believing the party's denials. Rato and Cospedal have both insisted they did not receive the money noted down in the accounts, while Cospedal issued a denial in Rajoy's name. Crusading former magistrate Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, who was disbarred last year precisely because he wrongly ordered the secret recording in prison of conversations between lawyers and remand prisoners accused of PP-related corruption, may be celebrating today. The PP's protestations of innocence are spoiled by the fact that one of the men alleged to have run the double-accounting, its former treasurer Luis B\u00e1rcenas, was recently found to have a \u20ac20m secret bank account in Switzerland. B\u00e1rcenas has admitted that, during a tax amnesty approved by the PP government last year, he declared \u20ac11m that had previously been hidden. He is already under investigation by the courts. B\u00e1rcenas is known to have taken away boxes full of documents from the PP headquarters \u2013 provoking concern that he might blackmail the party - but sources tell me he did not provide the accounts books to El Pais. The party claims it is the victim of dirty tricks and conspiracies, but it also used that excuse when it, at first, tried to support B\u00e1rcenas. It has since cut the former treasurer adrift. Cospedal also claims this has no impact on Rajoy's ability to run the country. Time will be the judge of that. Banks across Europe have started paying back the European Central Bank some of the \u20ac1 trillion borrowed last year to save themselves from ruin. The longer term refinancing operations (LTROs) were taken up mainly, but not exclusively, by Spanish and Italian banks who were struggling to raise funds. The ECB said 278 banks started repaying the cash since the first opportunity, which was yesterday. In the UK, Barclays, HSBC and Lloyds all borrowed funds, with the latter expected to repay the full amount of \u20ac13.5bn by end of February. Santandar, Commerzbank, BNP Paribas, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and UniCredit, among others, also took the LTROs. Over to Greece, where transport workers and doctors went on strike today to protest against the austerity measures imposed by the stricken country's international lenders. ekathimerini reports: Public transport in Athens was disrupted as bus, trolleybus and railway workers went on strike while ships and ferries stayed docked at ports after seamen began a 48-hour stoppage. Doctors and medical workers went on strike to protest 'dangerous' austerity measures that they said had left the nation's health system short of supplies and staff. Greece's main public sector union ADEDY also called a walkout in solidarity with the striking healthcare workers. 'They are closing down hospitals and cutting down on medical equipment and medicines in the hospitals,' ADEDY's secretary general Ilias Iliopoulos said. 'There is a big shortage in doctors and other medical staff \u2026 We are asking the government to stop the collapse of the public health service.' While over in Germany, inflation eased to 1.7% in the year to Janaury, falling back below the European Central Bank's target for price stability. Christian Schulz of Berenberg bank blames the strong euro: The strong euro may already be impacting inflation via lower import prices. The euro has risen 12% against the dollar since its July 2012 low, 31% against the yen and 10% against sterling. He said the strength of the euro was a sign of confidence, but it could cause inflation to fall even further this year, missing the ECB's forecast of 1.6% for 2013. He does not expect the ECB to lower interest rates, but said it could start making noises about easing monetary policy, in an attempt to weaken the euro. While the ECB remains unlikely to lower interest rates or engage in other monetary easing given the signs of economic recovery, it may try and sound more dovish to ease the upward pressure on the euro. Meanwhile the jobless figures from the US are slightly worse than expected. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 38,000 to 368,000 in the week ending 26 January, compared with expectations of 350,000. Ryan Wang at HSBC in New York said: It looks like the underlying trend in claims is just stable at around 360,000, which is where we were for much of 2012. Today\u2019s increase in claims I think is evidence that the low readings from early January were distorted. The positive US income figures have, however, been affected by various one-off factors. After yesterday's unpleasant surprise over US GDP, there was happier news today, with a shock 2.6% jump in personal incomes in December. That is the biggest jump in eight years and well above expectations for a 0.8% gain. It will fuel hopes that consumer spending will drive momentum in the largest economy in the world. Cospedal's crucial point was that the documents, which El Pa\u00eds has published excerpts from, are false. She said: I won't comment on the content of the documents published today, because I'm here to deny their veracity. She said these accusations were part of a conspiracy to harm Spain's ruling party, the PP. We do feel under attack, but I have no idea who may want to damage us. Our correspondent in Madrid, Giles Tremlett reports: Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy's People's party (PP) has today claimed that documents allegedly showing secret payments to Rajoy and other senior party leaders are not valid and say they will take legal action against anyone who repeats the allegations. That currently means almost all Spanish media, which are giving the documents published by El Pa\u00eds extensive coverage \u2013 with live links to the press conference by party secretary general, Mar\u00eda Dolores Cospedal, that ended a few minutes ago. Senior PP officials are making some kind of sworn declarations to the party's current treasurer today, though it is not clear what these declarations say. Cospedal says that the scandal does not damage Rajoy's ability to govern Spain as the country struggles to emerge from a bruising double-dip recession that saw the economy shrink by 0.7% in the last quarter alone and as the unemployment rate climbs above 26%. And they're off. The secretary general of the People's party, Mar\u00eda Dolores de Cospedal, is holding the press conference. She starts off by repeating the firm denials issued earlier in the day. Over in Madrid, Spain's ruling party is about to kick off its press conference, where it will answer accusations in the El Pa\u00eds newspaper that it maintained secret accounts and made undeclared payments to members. For Spanish speakers, it is likely to be showing on RTVE.es. Our correspondent Giles Tremlett is there and will be updating the blog on all the key points. Those EU budget discussions are set to start again at the next European council, on 7-8 February. And already the leaders are talking about vetoes. Open Europe reports: The next European council summit \u2013 entirely devoted to negotiations over the 2014-2020 EU budget \u2013 is only one week away, and the sequence of veto threats may have just begun all over again. Guess who fired the starting gun (clue: not David Cameron)? It was Italy's outgoing prime minister, Mario Monti. He told a conference in Brussels yesterday: 'There would be no coherence between what everyone is saying about the need for growth and the adoption of an inadequate [long-term EU] budget \u2026 The orgy of cuts that certain countries want to apply is inconsistent. Therefore, I\u2019m not sure that it would be irresponsible for a country to disagree with a budget proposal which is inadequate.' That is, a veto threat, Monti-style. It remains to be seen if council president Herman van Rompuy's new-found optimism (see 10.53am) can withstand another bruising round of budget talks. In the meantime, Italian PM Mario Monti has dashed from Brussels to Berlin in a matter of moments and is now giving a press conference alongside the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Monti said Italy has been contributing disproportionately to the EU budget compared to its wealth, and that rebate mechanisms need to be reviewed. He's also hoping for the next budget to look at growth and not just austerity. It's essential that the next long-term EU budget is devoted to boosting growth, jobs and social cohesion in Europe. Thanks to Open Europe's Vincenzo Scarpetta (@LondonerVince) for the updates. It seems we'll be waiting that bit longer for an explanation from Spain's ruling party over allegations of secret payments (see below). If you thought German retail sales looked bad (see 7.48am), you may want to look away now. Greek retail sales slumped 16.6% in the year to November, according to ELSTAT. That follows a 17.1% decline in October. It's hard to talk about a recovery with these kind of figures being bandied around. On a lighter note, it seems president of the European council, Herman van Rompuy, is feeling upbeat following his meeting with Italian PM Mario Monti. Rompuy, who is a big fan of the haiku, just published something that Google translates roughly as... The bending trees / Leaves rustle and slide / Winter blows away That appears significantly more cheery than his offering in November last year, after the EU summit collapsed without a deal (or much progress) on the European Union budget. He wrote at the time: The night has fallen/The bare branches can be seen/Even more lonely Here's Rompuy with Monti earlier today. Sticking with Spain, Santander said profits fell last year driven by rising defaults in its home market. Santander posted profits of \u20ac2.2bn in 2012, down by almost 60% on the previous year. The bank blamed the decline on rising defaults in Spain and Brazil, and writedowns on Spanish property deals that have gone sour. The largest lender in the eurozone did, however, say it had now taken the worst of Spain's property crash. Chairman Emilio Bot\u00edn said: In 2013, once we have finished special provisioning, we will see strong growth in results, supported by recurring income and cost control. El Pa\u00eds has been careful to say that the alleged slush fund is not necessarily illegal. Until recently, Spanish political parties were allowed to receive anonymous donations. If the party leaders then declared the income to the taxman, the payments could still pass as legal. But, as Reuters notes, The allegations raise serious ethical questions about party operations, especially because many of them occurred during Spain's building boom, in which politicians granted large numbers of development contracts. More from Spain, ahead of the ruling PP's press conference at 11.30am, where it will answer accusations about secret payments. As reported earlier, the People's Party has denied reports in the Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds that it maintained a secret accounting system, or made undeclared payments to the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy. The newspaper today published excerpts from handwritten accounts it claims were maintained by PP treasurers over almost two decades, showing donations from companies and regular payments of thousands of euros to Rajoy and other party leaders. But the PP denies any knowledge of the documents \u2026 The People's party has no knowledge of the handwritten notes that were published and of their content, and it cannot be recognised, in any case, as this political party's books. At the risk of sounding flippant, Italy's Monte dei Paschi scandal has to be one of the more colourful banking scandals. For a start, it deals with the world's oldest bank, established in 1472 to lend to \"the poor or miserable or needy\". Now it seems the secret document at the heart of the scandal lay for months in a concealed safe in a 14th-century Tuscan palace. Silvia Aloisi and Stefano Bernabei of Reuters report: Chief executive Fabrizio Viola said he learned about the safe's contents only last October, a full 10 months after he had been called in to sort out Italy's third biggest bank. The 2009 document revealing derivatives deals that have run up huge losses for Banca Monte dei Paschi (BMPS.MI) came to light in the office of Viola's predecessor at the bank's headquarters in Siena. 'The document was in a safe, moreover in an office that was no longer mine,' said Viola. 'I don't think that the person who put it there had been trying to hide it. But there is no doubt that the document had not been used in the bank's accounting.' The document found at the 540-year-old bank's head offices \u2013 which are appropriately in a restored ancient fortress \u2013 was a contract mandating Japanese bank Nomura to carry out deals on behalf of Monte dei Paschi. Quick look at the markets, which have been knocked by the shock decline in US GDP, out yesterday. Spain has been particularly hard hit, as markets show concern about any political instability that could arise from today's accusations about secret payments. UK FTSE 100: down 0.5%, or 32 points, at 6291 France CAC 40: down 0.7% Germany DAX: down 0.4% Italy FTSE MIB: down 0.8% Spain IBEX: down 1.7% (with apparently only one company in positive territory) Spain's ruling People's party \u2013 which has been accused of making secret payments to members including the current prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, (see 8.36am and following) \u2013 has organised a press conference at 12.30pm in Madrid (11.30am GMT), to react to the accusations in the El Pais story. We'll be following that and other developments from the eurozone live. Here's Thomas Gitzel of VP Bank on the better-than-expected German jobless figures. The improvement in mood is ubiquitous. Analysts and companies are becoming more optimistic about the future development of the economy. But not all signs point to growth. Companies do not yet completely share the effusive optimism on the financial markets. A return to a significant increase in the number of new jobs should not be expected because the order situation has not improved yet. There's better news out of Europe's largest economy. It appears the German jobless rate has come down to 6.8%, compared with expectations it would remain at December's level of 6.9%. January saw a (seasonally adjusted) 16,000 decline in the number of unemployed, while economists thought there would be an increase of 8,000. This will be a relief after gloomy retail sales figures out this morning (see 7.48am). The jobless figures are arguably more significant than the volatile retail sales data, and show up the stark contrasts between different European member states. For one, German youth unemployment remained unchanged at 8%. In Spain 60% of young people are out of work. The unadjusted jobless total rose above the 3m mark for the first time since March last year, but the German labour office said seasonal factors were behind that increase. El Pa\u00eds appears to have got its hands on secret accounts of Spain's ruling Partido Popular (People's party) from 1990-2009. The paper reports that current prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, received \u20ac25,200 a year in undeclared income from 1997 until 2008. British blogger Matthew Bennett, who is based in Spain, says it appears the PP was caught on the hop by the story. The party has since issued a denial, saying the PP has no secret accounts. Over to Madrid, where the scandal engulfing Spain's ruling party is deepening. The Spanish daily El Pa\u00eds reports this morning that the country's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, took \u20ac250,000 from secret party funds. More on that shortly but, as Russian Market notes, with the current crisis in Spain any whiff of a scandal will hit politicians particularly hard. Sticking with the UK, data out overnight showed consumer confidence rose in Janaury, as people grew a little less pessimistic about the year ahead and more willing to splash out on big purchases. Research group GfK said consumer confidence rose to -26 in January, from -29 in December. It beat expectations of a rise to -28 and is up from the trough of -33 in December 2011. Households thought now was the least bad time to make a major purchase since December 2010. Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank said: The British consumer is getting closer to moving out of intensive care, but the patient remains very weak and the road to recovery will be long. With inflation running increasingly ahead of wage growth again, it will be a little while yet before consumption drives growth. We continue to expect improvements in the availability and cost of bank credit to encourage a very gradual improvement in consumption in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, Britain's big four high street banks could be forced to pay millions of pounds in compensation to small businesses after the Financial Services Authority found they mis-sold complex insurance products in more than 90% of cases. My colleague Phillip Inman reports: The Financial Services Authority said the banks will conduct a review of small business accounts to determine the extent of the mis-selling that dates back to 2001. As many as 40,000 so-called interest rate swaps could have been mis-sold to small businesses in the latest scandal to hit the banking industry. The regulator has already forced banks to pay more than \u00a310bn in compensation and admin costs following the mis-selling of payment protection insurance and is conducting an inquiry into the full extent of the Libor interest rate setting crisis. This early investigation only looked at 173 test cases, but the implications of its findings suggest further pain lies in store for the banks. Back to Germany, where Deutsche bank posted a surprise net loss of \u20ac2.2bn for the fourth quarter. Germany's biggest bank was hit by hefty litigation and restructuring charges as the bank slims down, in light of the changing investment banking environment. Deutsche is being investigated for alleged manipulation of benchmark interest rates. Today it announced \u20ac1bn in litigation charges in the fourth quarter, which it said reflected \"adverse court rulings and developments in regulatory investigations\". Co-chief executives Juergen Fitschen and Anshu Jain said: We embarked upon the path of deliberate but sometimes uncomfortable change in order to deliver long term, sustainable success for the bank. Simultaneously, we set the bank on course for fundamental cultural change. This journey will take years, not months. Last week Germany's second-biggest lender, Commerzbank said it was planning to cut as many as 6,000 jobs, or more than 10% of its workforce. Better news from the UK, where house prices jumped 0.5% in Janaury according to Nationwide. That follows two months where prices remained unchanged and means that average prices now stand at \u00a3162,245. Prices are flat compared with a year ago, but lenders and estate agents predict the market will slowly improve this year and say government efforts to boost lending are having an effect. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: There have been tentative signs of a pick-up in activity in recent months. The funding for lending scheme has achieved some success in bringing down mortgage rates, with some signs of a pick-up in lending activity. Hopefully, the momentum will continue to build in the months ahead, though much will depend on whether the wider economic environment improves. The more important data out of Germany today will be the unemployment figures at 8.55am. Analysts are expecting the jobless rate to stick at 6.9%, with just 8,000 more unemployed in January. We shall see. And the EU foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels with plenty to discuss. France and Britain will be pushing the region to lift an embargo on weapons for Syria in order to help the opposition; while the group will also talk about the situation in Mali. Germany retail sales (December): 7am UK Nationwide house prices: 7am Van Rompuy meets Monti in Brussels: 7.30am France producer prices (December): 7.45am France consumer spending (December): 7.45am ECB's Constancio speaks in Brussels: 8.30am EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels: 8.30am Germany unemployment (January): 8.55am Italy PPI (December): 9am Germany CPI (January): 1pm US weekly jobless claims: 1.30pm ECB's Praet speaks in Brussels: 2.45pm Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. Just in, we've had some very disappointing economic data out of Germany. Retail sales dropped by their largest amount in more than three years in December, denting hopes that consumer demand will help drive Europe's biggest economy this year as exports weaken. The Federal Statistics Office said retail sales dropped 1.7% in December, compared with expectations of a 0.1% decline. Over the year, they fell by a massive 4.7%, compared with expectations of a much smaller 1.5% decline. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Given that we saw the German economy contract in Q4 it really wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise to see a fall in retail sales, however the extent of the fall off was, with a fall of 4.7% year on year, well beyond expectations of a 1.5% drop. We'll have more on that as it comes in, as well as further developments in the eurozone and around.",

B\u00e1rcenas has admitted that, during a tax amnesty approved by the PP government last year, he declared \u20ac11m that had previously been hidden.

      "bodyText": "Spain's biggest bank, Banco Santander, made debt provisions of more than \u20ac18bn (\u00a315.4bn) last year as the property downturn intensified and the number of toxic loans increased. The bank saw its profits collapse by almost 60% on the previous year to \u20ac2.1bn as a result of the rise in bad loans. Considered one of the leading survivors of the financial crash, Santander has suffered a sharp decline as Spain's economy has slumped. It avoided lending to many low income mortgage buyers in the housing bonanza before 2008, but has found itself involved in a string of property developments that have subsequently turned sour. Revenues from divisions in Latin America, Brazil and the UK have shored up profits. In the last three months of 2012 Spanish GDP contracted by 4% and is expected to slump again this year as government cuts and a combination of high unemployment and declining wages undermine consumer and business spending. The bank said its non-performing loan ratio last year rose 0.65 percentage points to 4.5%. For Spain, it was up 1.25 percentage points to 6.7%. The UK division revealed a 2% drop in pre-tax profits to \u00a31.23bn in 2012. On an after-tax basis, profits at the UK arm rose 4% to \u00a3939m. Head of UK banking Steve Pateman said Santander had also been forced to make larger provisions over possible problems with a complicated insurance product. He said the bank had uncovered numerous former Alliance &amp; Leicester small business customers that were potentially mis-sold interest rate swaps, in the latest scandal to hit the sector. Amid concerns that all the major banks mis-sold similar products, he said the bank was reviewing a number of cases where complex financial products were sold by Alliance &amp; Leicester before the former building society's takeover by Santander at the height of the credit crunch in 2008. It has identified less than 500 potential swap mis-selling cases and has set aside \u00a3232m to cover costs such as compensation for mis-selling of interest rate swaps, on top of \u00a3751m put by in 2011 for the payment protection insurance scandal.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's big four high street banks could be forced to pay millions of pounds in compensation to small businesses, after the main City regulator found they mis-sold complex insurance products in more than 90% of cases. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) said the banks would conduct a review of small business accounts to determine the extent of the mis-selling, which dates back to 2001. As many as 40,000 so-called interest rate swaps could have been mis-sold to small businesses in the latest scandal to hit the banking industry. But the regulator backed away from demands from small business groups that banks be found be considered guilty unless they can prove their innocence, following a precedent set by the mortgage endowment and payment protection insurance scandals. The regulator has already forced banks to pay more than \u00a310bn in compensation and admin costs following the mis-selling of payment protection insurance, and is conducting an inquiry into the full extent of the Libor interest rate setting crisis. MPs and peers on the Banking Standards Commission attacked banks on Wednesday for maintaining sky-high bonus payments to senior staff, despite the succession of mis-selling scandals that have cost customers billions of pounds and undermined the industry's reputation. The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, welcomed the ruling, which he said underlined the need to reform the industry. \"The degree to which swap mis-selling to SMEs was found to have occurred underlines the need for a cultural change in the banks,\" he said. Business secretary Vince Cable said the scandal was an example of \"the little guy paying for the big banks' wrongdoing\". \"Malpractices like this have no place in Britain's business environment, which we are committed to making one of the best and fairest in the world,\" he said. \"The immediate priority is to ensure small businesses are not driven out of business by banks pursuing liabilities for swaps that they mis-sold.\" Small business lobby groups warned that businesses would be made bankrupt unless the regulator insisted on a speedy resolution. John Walker, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said sky-high insurance payments also needed to be suspended and a more open assessment of compensation payments after banks were given the job of determining what constitutes a consequential loss. \"What is clear is that firms will need expert support when they enter the scheme to ensure they receive the redress they deserve,\" he said. The FSA said it found that, in the 173 test cases examined in the study, more than 90% of sales did not comply with at least one or more regulatory requirements. Three of Britain's biggest banks \u2013 Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 have already set aside about \u00a3630m to cover the cost of potential mis-selling claims, and the upcoming round of annual results will reveal the latest provisions in the industry. Lloyds has yet to make a statement on potential costs. Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks, Co-operative Bank, and Santander will hear in the next couple of weeks whether they must also conduct reviews. The FSA said a significant proportion of the cases would result in compensation being due to the customer. The products were marketed as low-cost protection against rising interest rates, often as a condition of a business loan, but left firms facing huge bills if rates fell. Firms also faced hefty penalties to get out of the deals, which many said they were not told about. Banks have been working with the FSA to begin the compensation process and have launched pilot reviews of some 200 alleged cases to assess if mis-selling took place and potential compensation. Martin Wheatley, chief executive designate of the Financial Conduct Authority, which will take over from the FSA later this year, said: \"This marks significant progress in our review of these products. We believe that our work will ensure a fair and reasonable outcome for small and unsophisticated businesses. \"Small businesses will now see the result of the review as the banks look at their individual cases. Where redress is due, businesses will be put back into the position they should have been without the mis-sale. But it is important to remember that this review is firmly focused on the particular circumstances of each sale. These will determine whether there were failings in the sales process and, if so, whether redress is due.\"",

    "webTitle": "Household income is measure of economic recovery, LSE panel says", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Politicians should track progress in repairing Britain's recession-scarred economy by measuring how the average household is faring instead of focusing on GDP alone, according to a report by a panel of heavyweight economists. The London School of Economics Growth Commission, in findings published on Thursday, calls for statistics on median household income to be published regularly alongside quarterly GDP figures, and to be used as a measure of whether government policies are working. The high-level panel \u2013 including Nobel prizewinner Chris Pissarides, ex-BP boss John Browne, the three former Bank of England rate-setters Richard Lambert, Rachel Lomax and Tim Besley, as well as the LSE's John Van Reenen, director of its centre for economic performance \u2013 offers a series of prescriptions for tackling the long-term failings of the UK economy. They argue that tracking median household income in the runup to the financial crisis would have revealed that the benefits of growth were being swallowed up by a small segment of society. \"Increasing inequality is not an inevitable byproduct of growth, especially if policies are pursued that make growth more inclusive,\" the report says. In what they bill as a \"manifesto for growth\", the authors argue that in three areas \u2013 human capital, infrastructure, and long-term investment \u2013 the UK risks falling behind its international rivals. They call for a boost to education, through the creation of a \"flexible ecology\" of school types, and longer probation periods and better rewards for the best-performing teachers, to improve the chances of children from low-income families. The authors would also like to see a \"new institutional architecture\" for major planning projects, to prevent politicians delaying decisions for decades and ensure the economy's long-term needs are met on the basis of the best expert advice. \"Nowhere is the problem of UK infrastructure better illustrated than by airport capacity in the south-east, where generations of politicians have prevaricated to a point where there is serious risk to London's position as a major hub.\" Under the regime advocated by the economists, there would be a national-level infrastructure strategy board, to give independent expert advice; an infrastructure planning commission to draw up and approve plans for specific projects; and a new infrastructure bank to provide a mix of public and private finance. Channelling long-term investment to promising small businesses is another major shortcoming of the UK economy, according to the report, which calls for the government to boost competition in banking, and encourage alternative sources of finance, including by removing the tax advantages of debt-fuelled takeovers. The latest official figures, published by the Bank of England on Thursday, show that net lending to businesses continued to decline last month. The panel is also highly critical of the prime minister's decision to promise a referendum on Britain's EU membership, saying: \"Calls to leave the EU through a referendum are not only misguided: they create the very uncertainty that will damage investment and productivity right now. It is analogous to the needless self-inflicted wounds that the US is causing in its debates over the debt ceiling and fiscal cliff.\" Presenting the report, Tim Besley said that while the coalition was focused on short-term deficit reduction, commitment to a series of longer-term reforms could help to \"crowd in\" private sector investment and deliver a growth dividend. \"We lack a heart of government to drive this through,\" he said. \"There's very little at the centre.\" However, business secretary Vince Cable insisted: \"The government is implementing an industrial strategy in partnership with business to tackle the very issues the LSE's Growth Commission report identifies.\"",
