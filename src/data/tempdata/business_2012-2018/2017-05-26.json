      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office has further delayed its decision on whether to bring any criminal charges against Barclays and former executives at the bank over a 2008 fundraising. A decision is now expected in mid-June, despite the SFO setting an end-of-May deadline earlier in the year \u2013 itself a delay from an end of March deadline. The latest setback means that Barclays and a group of former senior bankers will not know the outcome of the five-year investigation until after the general election on 8 June. The probe into the circumstances around an emergency fundraising from a unit of Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund was announced in August 2012. The decision into one of the most high-profile investigations conducted by the SFO comes at a sensitive time. The Conservative party manifesto outlined plans to roll the SFO into the National Crime Agency, in an attempt to \u201cimproving intelligence sharing and bolstering the investigation of serious fraud, money laundering and financial crime\u201d. The investigation, according to disclosures by Barclays, focuses on commercial arrangements between the bank and Qatar Holding \u2013 an investment vehicle for the Gulf state \u2013 which bought shares in Barclays during two fundraisings at the height of the financial crisis. In June 2008 Barclays raised a total of \u00a34.5bn then a further \u00a37.3bn in October from a number of investors including Qatar Holding. In documents accompanying the June fund aisings Barclays disclosed an \u201cadvisory services\u201d arrangement with Qatar but did not put a value on the deal. It did not disclose the arrangement in the October documentation or value them. The bank has since said the fees amounted to \u00a3332m payable over five years. Barclays first revealed investigations into Qatari arrangements in July 2012 and admitted in September 2013 that the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, wanted to fine it \u00a350m for \u201creckless behaviour\u201d during the cash calls. That finding was stayed while the SFO investigated, although the City regulator has since reopened its inquiry following the disclosure of new documents by the bank. The bank had also admitted to the US justice department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating. Barclays did not comment on Friday on the further delay but in its annual report published in February it said it continued to contest the City regulator\u2019s findings and that it \u201ccontinues to respond to requests for further information in that investigation, which is at an advanced stage\u201d. The investigation has reportedly involved 44 individuals being questioned by the SFO, including the bank\u2019s former finance director Chris Lucas and chief executive John Varley. At one point there had been expectations that Barclays would be offered a deferred prosecution agreement \u2013 a form of settlement \u2013 although this no longer appears to be on the cards. Earlier this year, Rolls-Royce paid \u00a3671m to settle its case with the SFO while Tesco paid a fine of \u00a3129m as part of a DPA over an accounting scandal. The fundraisings also prompted other legal cases. The bank has described a \u00a3721m claim from financier Amanda Staveley as \u201cfundamentally misconceived\u201d. Her claim against the bank is for her firm PCP Capital Partners, for fees she argues should have been received for being involved in the financings. Also, a former Barclays banker, Richard Boath, is claiming he was unfairly dismissed after the SFO shared a 900-page transcript of interviews relating to the criminal investigation with the bank. The events of 2008 have prompted a number of other court cases. Royal Bank of Scotland is attempting to settle claims from shareholders that they were misled during the time of a \u00a312bn cash call in April 2008. A high court judge has adjourned the case \u2013 which was due to start last Monday and would require former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin to give evidence - until 7 June to allow settlement attempts. Later in the year, Lloyds Banking Group faces accusations from shareholders that they were not told that HBOS was dependent on emergency funding from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England at the time of its takeover by Lloyds in 2008.",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Britain\u2019s biggest companies reached record levels on Friday as a slump in the pound boosted the value of firms with overseas earnings. The FTSE 100 jumped 63 points to close the day at 7,547, closely followed by the FTSE 250, seen as a better barometer of the health of UK business, which also reached an all-time closing high, rising 57 points to 20,024. The strong performance of the stock market followed a fall in the pound, which racked up its worst falls since early February after an opinion poll showed prime minister Theresa May\u2019s lead down to just 5 percentage points over the Labour opposition less than two weeks before the election. Sterling sank against the euro and by a full percentage point against the dollar to below \u00a31.28, its lowest in a month and more than two cents below last week\u2019s six-month highs. Many of the UK\u2019s biggest companies earn the majority of their earnings in dollars and have enjoyed a strong surge in earnings since the Brexit vote, which triggered a near 25% fall in the pound before settling at around 15% in recent months. Rolls-Royce was among many firms with the majority of their earnings from overseas to gain from the higher value of the dollar. GlaxoSmithKline was also boosted by an upgrade of the pharmaceuticals group by analysts from \u201chold\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d, rising 25.5p to \u00a316.43. The pound also suffered after an upgrade in US GDP growth, which increased to 1.2% against an earlier estimate of just 0.7%, strengthened the dollar. Strong signals that the eurozone continues to gain momentum added to the euro\u2019s strength. A survey of German business leaders found they expect exports to grow further despite reaching record highs. Surveys of British businesses have added to optimistic forecasts after the UK\u2019s GDP growth in the first quarter was downgraded to 0.2% from 0.3%. A survey by the CBI of services firms earlier this week found that optimism increased markedly on the previous month and investment intentions were upbeat. But analysts said the catalyst for sterling\u2019s fall was a YouGov poll in The Times giving Labour 38% of the vote, three points up on last week, and the Conservatives down one point at 43%, possibly handing May only a slim majority in parliament. It was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday and marks Labour\u2019s best standing in the polls since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in September 2015. The assumption that the Tories would win handsomely, apparently strengthening May\u2019s hand in talks on leaving the European Union, has driven the pound higher since she called an election for 8 June. The running logic of financial markets was that a big victory would let May face down hardline Brexiters in her party to make compromises needed for a smoother departure. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \u201cWith the pound already under pressure due to weaker than expected economic data, this surprise poll has acted as an additional catalyst in pushing the pound to a two-month low against the euro and its lowest level this month against the US dollar. \u201cHaving started the campaign on a \u2018strong and stable\u2019 footing, recent policy mis-steps by Mrs May have seen the election campaign take on the look of an \u2018ugly contest\u2019 of mediocre candidates, and that appears to be being reflected in the recent performance of the pound.\u201d Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester, said: \u201cSterling is likely to continue to be under pressure now until the election is out of the way, if polling continues to indicate its a tighter race. \u201cFor the market the worst outcome is if we have further uncertainty with the chances of a hung parliament.\u201d Adam Cole, head of G10 strategy with RBC in London, said: \u201cYouGov says the swing in the latest poll is probably due to Conservative manifesto commitments, some of which have changed subsequently. \u201cThere will likely be a large number of opinion polls over the weekend, so this picture could change either way in the next few days.\u201d YouGov said May\u2019s personal rating improved from -8 on Monday, the night of her U-turn on the controversial social care \u201cdementia tax\u201d proposal, to +1 in the following days, while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal rating slipped from -11 \u2013 his best position in the campaign \u2013 to -16.",

      "bodyText": "A late PS: Here\u2019s Phillip Inman on today\u2019s market action: Breaking! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit a fresh all-time closing high. The blue-chip index surged to new levels, racking up its fifth week of gains, as the slump in the value of the pound pushed shares higher in London. The FTSE 100 ended up 29 points higher at 7547, a gain of 0.4%. The FTSE 250, which tracks smaller companies, also hit a fresh record high of 20024 points. But there\u2019s no jubilation in the City, as traders watch the pound nurse its losses after its rough day in weeks. Sterling has tumbled by one and a half cents to $1.278, a one-month low, following YouGov\u2019s latest poll suggesting that Jeremy Corbyn has narrowed the gap on Theresa May to just five points. The pound is also wallowing at a two-month low against the euro, at \u20ac1.145. City traders are now rethinking the prospects of Theresa May securing a big majority in next month\u2019s election. There\u2019s even talk about a possible hung parliament, that might make the Brexit process even messier. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Markets says this has hurt the pound: The pound has been looking toppy as election odds narrowed since the release of the manifestos. The latest polls from YouGov showed the Tories with only a five-point lead over Labour. A five point gap looks to have been the breaking point. Polls are indicating a real chance of another hung parliament in the UK Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, adds: The precipitate fall in the pound is undoubtedly helping, with the currency taking a rather dramatic tumble below $1.28 as the script for the general election is torn up. And here\u2019s the moment that the script hit the floor.... The pound also suffered from an upgrade to America\u2019s growth figures, which boosted the US dollar. That was a sharp contrast with Britain\u2019s GDP figures yesterday, which showed growth was even weaker than first thought (at just 0.2%). Capital Economics say: Our view that the pound\u2019s recent rally can continue as the economy remains resilient and Brexit worries gradually ease has been dealt something of a double blow by the downward revision to Q1\u2019s UK GDP figures and the YouGov poll for The Times showing a dramatic narrowing in the Conservatives\u2019 lead over Labour to just 5 points. A warning that neither of the main parties are being honest about their manifesto commitments also dampened the mood in the City. That\u2019s a good moment to stop this blog. Best wishes for the bank holiday weekend, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW It\u2019s turning into a rout! The pound has now fallen below $1.28 for the first time in a month, and has lost around 1.5 cents since the YouGov poll came out. Here\u2019s another depressing chart from the WEF\u2019s report into pensions: Whoever wins next month\u2019s election, many younger Britons face working into the 70s thanks to the pensions crisis. That\u2019s according to the World Economic Forum today, which warns that rising longevity will drive pension deficits to staggering large levels without big changes. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The retirement age in Britain and other leading developed countries will need to rise to 70 by the middle of the century to head off the biggest pension crisis in history, according to the World Economic Forum. The body that runs the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos said deficits in the world\u2019s six largest pension systems would more than quadruple to $224tn by 2050 unless people worked longer and saved more. With people born today having a life expectancy of more than 100, the WEF said the cost of providing security in retirement for a rapidly ageing population was the financial equivalent of climate change. It warned the huge and spiralling cost would imperil the incomes of future generations and set the industrial world up for the biggest pension crisis in history. The WEF said it had examined the world\u2019s six biggest pension saving systems \u2013 the US, the UK, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia \u2013 and found that all were coming under strain from an expected global increase in the numbers over-65s rising from 600 million to 2.1 billion in 2050. \u201cThe anticipated increase in longevity and resulting ageing populations is the financial equivalent of climate change,\u201d said Michael Drexler, head of financial and infrastructure systems at the WEF. \u201cWe must address it now or accept that its adverse consequences will haunt future generations, putting an impossible strain on our children and grandchildren.\u201d More here: Newsflash: American consumer confidence was a little weaker than expected this month, but still pretty high. The University of Michigan\u2019s monthly healthcheck of consumer morale has come in at 97.1 for May, down from the preliminary reading of 97.7. That up on April\u2019s 97.0, and close to its highest levels since the US election last November. The survey\u2019s chief economist, Richard Curtin, says: \u201cConsumer sentiment has continued to move along the high plateau established following Trump\u2019s election.\u201d As the pound drops further, the FTSE 100 hits fresh record highs. The blue-chip index is now up 30 points at 7552, a gain of 0.4%. The final trading day of the week is underway in New York. Shares have dipped a little, as investors get ready for the long weekend (markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day). The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 23 points, or 0.1%, to 21,060. Richard de Meo, managing director of Foenix Partners, reckons the Federal Reserve is now very likely to raise American interest rates next month: Upward revisions to 1.2% for first quarter growth have confirmed the world\u2019s largest economy to be in rude health, strengthening the case for a Fed rate hike on June 14th. [Fed chair Janet] Yellen will find the 0.60% quarterly uptick in consumer spending to be particularly pleasing ahead of what is being enthusiastically priced in by fixed income markets \u2013 the implied probability of policy action was above 80% at the last count. Unless Donald Trump repeats his NATO tactics and shoulders his way into the headlines and barring any shock disappointments in the data calendar, no market event appears capable of preventing a mid-June US interest rate hike. James Knightley of iNG isn\u2019t too impressed with America\u2019s growth in the first quarter of the year, even though it\u2019s been revised up to 1.2% (annualised) He points out that it still lags behind other developed countries (not Britain, alas): US 1Q 2017 GDP growth has been revised up to 1.2% annualised from the 0.7% figure initially reported. There were slight improvements in all of the key components, but it is still a very disappointing outcome, mainly caused by a clear slowdown in consumer spending and a run down in inventories. The US dollar has rallied after America\u2019s first-quarter growth was revised up. And that\u2019s bad news for the pound, which has now spiralled to a one-month low of $1.2811, down more than a cent today. Breaking! America\u2019s growth rate in the first three months of this year has been revised up. US GDP increased at an \u2018annualised rate\u2019 of 1.2% in January-March, the Commerce Department says, up from an initial estimate of 0.7%. That\u2019s equivalent to a quarterly growth rate of 0.3%, the same as France, and faster than Britain after yesterday\u2019s downgrade to 0.2%. It\u2019s still the weakest expansion since the first three months of 2016. Economists, though, think growth is probably rebounding quite sharply in the current quarter. The Commerce Department has revised up its estimate for consumer spending, from +0.3% to +0.6%. Business investment was also strong, rising by 11.4%. Insurance group Legal &amp; General has given Ireland a boost in its bid to attract City jobs after Brexit. L&amp;G has picked Dublin as the new European hub for its investment management arm. And while it may not create many new jobs, the Irish government will be cheered that its efforts to woo major financial firms is paying off. Earlier this month, JP Morgan bought an office block in Dublin, seemingly in preparation for Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. The Irish Independent has more details: The move remains subject to regulatory approval, he said, stressing that the relocation would \u201chave no foreseeable impact on operations and staff in other LGIM locations\u201d. The total number of new jobs may be fewer than 50, but the move represents a significant win for the Government given L&amp;G\u2019s status as a household name within the industry. The investment manager is Europe\u2019s largest with more than \u20ac1 trillion in assets. It is known to be seeking a full EU base for after Brexit. Ouch! The pound just hit a three-week low of $1.2843 against the US dollar, as election nerves intensify. Chris Saint, senior analyst at HL Currency Service, says the decline in the Conservative\u2019s Party\u2019s leader over Labour is causing \u201cheavy losses\u201d. This adds an extra strand to political risks currently weighing on the pound, with markets previously taking it almost for granted that a larger parliamentary majority would hand Mrs May a stronger negotiating position in upcoming Brexit talks. Several of Britain\u2019s largest banks are the worst-performing stocks on the FTSE 100 so far today. Royal Bank of Scotland has shed 2.5%, with Barclays and Lloyds close behind. It\u2019s part of a wider selloff; bank shares across Europe have dropped, amid new worries about two Italian banks. Reuters has the details: Traders cited worries over the political situation in Italy and concerns surrounding ailing regional banks Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, even though the county\u2019s economy minister sought to reassure investors on Thursday that they will not be hit in any rescue of the two banks. Sterling is likely to remain volatile until the general election is concluded, suggests Paresh Davdraof of RationalFX. With the pound sliding below $1.29 against the dollar and at a two-month low against the euro, uncertainty over the outcome of the election is beginning to trouble the markets. In April when the election was called, a Conservative victory appeared all but secured, providing the government with a strong mandate to move forward with Brexit plans for negotiations, while also providing analysts more certainty as divorce proceedings with the EU got underway. Now, the very real possibility of a Labour victory with two weeks before polling day, however unlikely, raises the prospect of further disruption for analysts and a return to volatility in the pound as a new government determines the Brexit process. Whilst the pound has been able to remain steady in face of the week\u2019s tragic events and disappointing data, it is clear that the election is the most powerful driver behind the UK\u2019s currency. The next two weeks could see more volatility for sterling as polling figures in the run up to the election become more frequent. Analysts will be looking for any definitive signs that the Conservatives can win the election before the pound can consistently return to the levels seen recently.\u201d But, Chris Beauchamp of IG suspects that the pound might claw back some of today\u2019s losses, once traders have digested the latest polling data. Cable has spent the week trying vainly to break $1.30, but the most recent YouGov poll has empowered the bears. Such a polling bounce for Labour was also eminently predictable (a similar occurrence took place for the Conservatives in the 1997 election, and we know how that turned out), so we should see some cable buying as the session goes on. [Explainer: \u2018Cable\u2019 is City slang for the pound-dollar exchange rate, dating back to the days when traders in London and New York used a cable on the Atlantic Sea bed to track it. Some bright sparks occasionally call it \u2018Betty\u2019 instead (rhyming slang from WW2 pin-up Betty Grable...)] The pound\u2019s weakness is good news for European tourists planning a trip to this Sceptred Isle this summer. One euro now buys 87.1p on the foreign exchanges, up from just 83.1p in mid-April. The other side of the coin is that Brits face paying more to holiday in Europe this summer. Bloomberg have created a neat graphic, highlighting how the pound is sensitive to next month\u2019s election victory. A big Conservative victory is likely to drive sterling up, but a narrow win (or even a hung parliament) would spark a selloff. So YouGov\u2019s poll could potentially put sterling \u201cin the trouble zone\u201d, says Neil Jones, head of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank. \u201cSterling correlates well with anything that shows a Tory majority and vice versa, so if you\u2019ve got this situation where the majority closes right down, it may come to a critical level where it may not have a sufficient number of seats in the house. The market doesn\u2019t like that.\u201d More here. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says there is \u201cincreased nervousness\u201d in the City over the Brexit negotiations, which should begin shortly after the election. None of the parties appears to have either a coherent plan for a post Brexit Britain, or any vision of a coherent leadership. While mid-campaign polling wobbles are nothing new, take the rogue Scottish referendum poll in 2014, neither of the main parties appears to have manifestoes which appear to add up with the Institute of Fiscal Studies criticising both. We also have a fresh record high on the FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized UK-focused companies. The FTSE 250 has romped over the 20,000 point mark for the first time ever this morning, extending its recent rally. Restaurant Group (owner of Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s) has jumped 9% after reporting better sales figures than the City feared (like-for-like takings only fell by 1.8%) The Tory\u2019s shrinking poll lead is raising concerns that no party might win an overall majority in June\u2019s election, says Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester. Rochester explains: \u201cSterling is likely to continue to be under pressure now until the election is out of the way, if polling continues to indicate it\u2019s a tighter race.\u201d \u201cFor the market the worst outcome is if we have further uncertainty with the chances of a hung parliament.\u201d That uncertainty is keeping the pound pinned at a two-month low against the euro: Here\u2019s more details of the YouGocv poll that has sent the pound dropping: In other election news, an influential economic thinktank has warned that neither of the two major parties are being totally honest with the public over the state of the UK economy. After analysing the election manifestos, the Institute of Fiscal Studies has given both Labour and the Conservatives a poor score. As IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson puts it: \u201cThe shame of the two big parties\u2019 manifestos is that neither sets out an honest set of choices.\u201d The Conservatives are simply offering the public \u201cthe cuts already promised\u201d, says the IFS: \u201cCompared with Labour, they are offering a relatively smaller state and consequently lower taxes. With that offer come unacknowledged risks to the quality of public services, and tough choices over spending.\u201d But the IFS are also critical of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s economic plans; saying they would inevitably lead to higher taxes. \u201cFor Labour we can have pretty much everything - free higher education, free childcare, more spending on pay, health, infrastructure. \u201cAnd the pretence is that can all be funded by faceless corporations and \u2018the rich\u2019. Our Politics liveblog has more details: Newsflash! The FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time high. The blue-chip index has just nudged 7534 for the first time ever, thanks to the weak pound. Ironically, the drop in sterling is helping Britain\u2019s stock market outperform the rest of Europe. Most European markets are in the red, dragged down by energy companies (who have fallen following the drop in the oil price). But the FTSE 100 has gained a handful of points, thanks to multinational firms who benefit from a weak pound. The Conservative\u2019s shrinking election lead is the main story in the City this morning, reports Connor Campbell of SpreadEx: The most notable move came from sterling, which plunged half a percent against both the dollar, taking cable to a near 2 week low, and the euro, where the pound now sits at its worst price in around 2 months. The reason for this fall? Well, the latest election poll, conducted by YouGov for The Times, has seen the Tories\u2019 lead slashed to just 5 points, with Labour continuing to mount a post-manifesto release comeback. Any growth managed by sterling since April has largely been predicated on the assumption that the Conservatives would secure a landslide victory. That this presently doesn\u2019t seem to be the case has helped further erode confidence in the currency\u2019s current position. Sterling has also hit a two-month low against the euro, down 0.4% to \u20ac1.148. Guardian Business has launched a daily email.

For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A bout of general election jitters have sent sterling down to a two-week low this morning. The pound has lost almost a cent against the US dollar, after an opinion poll suggested that Conservative Party\u2019s lead over Labour has narrowed to just five points. The latest survey, from YouGov, has knocked the pound down by over half a cent against the US dollar to $1.2858, a two week low, and the biggest one-day fall since early May. The poll is shaking the City\u2019s confidence that Theresa May will win a large majority, possibly a landslide, on June 8th. That fuels concerns that Brexit could be even messier than feared, if May doesn\u2019t have the substantial \u2018mandate\u2019 she is demanding. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at foreign exchange firm OANDA, says the poll could be signalling a shock Labour victory: Sterling fell again overnight after a poll showed the gap between Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party has narrowed again. The lead \u2013 which only a few weeks ago stood at around 20 points \u2013 has fallen dramatically to just five according to this YouGov poll. With this kind of momentum and almost two weeks to go until the vote, not only is this not going to be the breeze that May anticipated when she called the snap election last month, it could yet turn into a humiliating defeat for the Conservative leader and her party. However, Royal Bank of Canada don\u2019t think the situation is quite that bad for the Tories. We note that the YouGov polls have tended to show a smaller Conservative lead than most of the other polls in recent weeks and also that YouGov says the swing in the latest poll is probably due to Conservative manifesto commitments, some of which have changed subsequently. Campaigning for the June 8 general election recommences today and there will likely be a large number of opinion polls over the weekend, so this picture could change either way in the next few days. Our Politics Live blog will be tracking all the action from the campaign trail, here: Also coming up Disappointment continues to ripple through the oil markets, after Opec and non-Opec members agreed to cut production for another nine months. Crude prices are down this morning, after tumbling around 4% yesterday, seemingly on disappointment that a more radical deal wasn\u2019t agreed.

In April when the election was called, a Conservative victory appeared all but secured, providing the government with a strong mandate to move forward with Brexit plans for negotiations, while also providing analysts more certainty as divorce proceedings with the EU got underway. Now, the very real possibility of a Labour victory with two weeks before polling day, however unlikely, raises the prospect of further disruption for analysts and a return to volatility in the pound as a new government determines the Brexit process.</p> <p>Whilst the pound has been able to remain steady in face of the week\u2019s tragic events and disappointing data, it is clear that the election is the most powerful driver behind the UK\u2019s currency.

      "bodyText": "A plague on both your houses. That, put simply, is the considered view of the Institute for Fiscal Studies on the tax and spending pledges made by the Conservative and Labour parties in their election manifestos. There was, the IFS noted, a real choice for voters on 8 June, marking quite a change from recent elections. But it was a choice between the undeliverable on the part of the Tories and the unworkable from Labour. Even by the IFS\u2019s exacting standards, it was a withering assessment. Theresa May\u2019s pitch to the public is more of the same. More austerity, more welfare cuts and a balanced budget by the middle of the next decade \u2013 10 years later than originally planned. If the idea behind providing few costed pledges in the Conservative manifesto was designed to provide the IFS with less to attack, the strategy didn\u2019t work. The thinktank says May\u2019s spending plans will put real pressure on public services, and in particular extend to 12 years what is comfortably the most severe squeeze on the NHS since it was founded in 1948. At a time when demographic and technological change is pushing up the cost of providing healthcare, the IFS says the average increase in the NHS budget between 2010 \u2013 when David Cameron became prime minister \u2013 and 2022-23 will be 1.4% a year on average, and just 1.2% a year from 2016-17 onwards. Hence the IFS\u2019s concern that the Conservative plans are not deliverable. Labour is planning to be more generous, but not by much. Over the past 60 years, the NHS budget has increased in real (inflation-adjusted) terms by 4.1% a year. Labour\u2019s proposed increase would be half that. The IFS gives the prime minister half a cheer for making an attempt to get to grip with the cost of an ageing population. But it notes that the scrapping of the triple lock on the state pension and the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance would make a trivial difference to spending. As for social care, the IFS\u2019s deputy director, Carl Emmerson, said that they seemed to be in \u201ca state of flux\u201d following this week\u2019s U-turn on capping costs. A state of flux is IFS-speak for complete shambles. Labour lost its hard-won economic credibility by virtue of being in power during the global financial crisis and has struggled to get it back. The latest attempt involves an increase of almost \u00a350bn a year in day-to-day government spending paid for by equivalent increases in tax. Infrastructure spending would rise by \u00a3250bn over the next 10 years funded by higher borrowing. The IFS doesn\u2019t have that much of a problem with borrowing for public investment when interest rates are historically low, noting that it could boost growth in the short- and the long-term if used wisely. The same, though, can\u2019t be said of the plans for day-to-day spending, where the thinktank is clear that the plan for paying for an expansion in state activity \u201cwould not work\u201d. Labour\u2019s tax proposals would raise at most \u00a340bn a year, the IFS said, and probably less than that. The thinktank says the party\u2019s \u00a349bn tax calculation involves factual mistakes, optimistic assumptions and unspecified tax increases. The plans would see the size of the state increase to a level not seen in 30 years, the IFS said. This, in itself, would not be an issue, since it would bring Britain into line with many other advanced economies. The issue is how to pay for it. \u201cIf [Labour] want the advantages of a bigger state they should be willing to candidly set out the consequences \u2013 higher taxation affecting broad segments of the population.\u201d Indeed, this is the gripe the IFS has with both parties. The Tories would shrink the state; Labour would expand it. If the opinion polls are to be believed, Labour\u2019s \u201csoak the rich\u201d approach has gone down rather better than \u201cmore of the same\u201d from the Conservatives. But neither, according to the IFS, is being entirely straight with the public about how their quite different visions would be realised.",

      "bodyText": "If you are regularly left staring at the spinning \u201cwheel of doom\u201d rather than your chosen iPlayer programme, now is the time to upgrade your broadband package to a faster fibre service, following the outbreak of a price war among the major providers. This week telecoms firm TalkTalk fired the latest salvo by cutting the cost of its \u201cup to 38Mbps\u201d faster fibre service to just \u00a325 a month (including the landline), meaning fibre now costs the same, or less, than many people are paying for their basic package. Until relatively recently most households were content with a basic/cheapest service which is advertised as up to 17Mbps, but rarely delivers more than 6Mbps \u2013 assuming you live in an urban area close to a street cabinet. However, fast-changing TV viewing habits \u2013 notably the increased use of Netflix and Amazon services, and catch-up TV \u2013 are forcing more households to consider faster connections. To get TalkTalk\u2019s \u00a325-a-month deal you need to sign a two-year contract. It is waiving the \u00a360 set-up fee and, unlike its rivals, promising no price rises during the contract term. While there are no free evening and weekend telephone calls included, you can add unlimited landline calls for \u00a37.50 a month. Plus.net (part of BT), Vodafone and the lesser-known Origin also offer fibre for \u00a325, although with the first two there are small set-up fees, and no price guarantee. Sky has a fibre deal that at \u00a320 a month looks cheaper, however users are limited to 25GB of data downloads each month, rather defeating the \u201cupgrading\u201d exercise. The prices, which must now include the landline cost to meet new price advertising rules, will look attractive to anyone who hasn\u2019t switched supplier recently \u2013 particularly those with BT who pay \u00a329.99 a month for its basic broadband/landline deal as a new customer, and a crazy \u00a340.99 a month if out of contract. BT\u2019s unlimited Infinity 1 fibre is \u00a335 a month on a 12-month contract. It comes with a free speed upgrade \u2013 to 76Mbps rather than the advertised 52Mbps. Be warned: there is a nasty \u00a360 upfront fee. Sky\u2019s unlimited up-to-38Mbps fibre deal is \u00a330 a month for 18 months with a \u00a349 set up fee, although you can probably haggle this away. Virgin Media offers by far the highest speeds by virtue of its cable network, but is pricier. Its up to 200Mbps phone and broadband package is \u00a337 a month for nine months then \u00a345 for the rest of the 12-month contract \u2013 plus \u00a320 activation. There is one major thing to consider before you sign up to fibre, says Dan Howdle, broadband expert at comparison website Cable.co.uk, and that is whether moving up to fibre will actually deliver. \u201cFor many it will be an upgrade in speed, but not all homes will benefit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt all comes down to how far your home is from the cabinet in the street. To gain a genuine speed increase you need to be within 900m. If your house is 1.8km away you\u2019ll see no discernible improvement and may as well stick with the cheaper basic service.\u201d He says the best way to check your likely speed is to use the application provided by Ofcom \u2013 checker.ofcom.org.uk. Your chosen supplier will also give you a likely speed. He adds that these predicted speeds are estimates only, and while correct in the majority of cases are still prone to error in areas where specific problems exist. Meanwhile, he predicts that many customers will be nervous about moving to cheapest provider TalkTalk given its well-publicised data breach problems over the past few years. \u201cYou\u2019d hope they now have the system in place to stop it happening again. On the plus side, it\u2019s the only big provider promising no price rises for the contract term, which, given the way the others have hiked prices recently, will be attractive.\u201d Fast forward The best thing about super-fast broadband is that, once installed, you don\u2019t have to think about it \u2013 it just works, writes Jim Griffin. And with so much of modern life increasingly geared around connectivity, I want to be sure my broadband is fast and reliable. But on moving house three years ago, having opted for Sky\u2019s bog-standard broadband, I was constantly thinking about internet speeds, or lack thereof. Our package promised something like 10Mbps, but in reality mustered 3Mbps. Web pages took an age to load, YouTube videos or clips on newspaper websites stuttered \u2013 it wasn\u2019t even fast enough to run the Super8Pool game on my phone (trivial you might think, but I was a pool ace!). Sky attempted to improve things, but said it was as fast as it could be. We finally jumped ship to Virgin, which was offering 50Mbps for \u00a342 (including TV) \u2013 and we regularly achieve that speed. Broadband is now something that just happens, no problem: surfing the web, streaming Netflix, watching videos. And my pool career is back on track.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When the Serious Fraud Office announced two weeks ago it was investigating suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering at Petrofac, shares in the oil services firm fell 14%. It was a sharp reaction to serious news, but it didn\u2019t suggest outright panic in the ranks of investors. One could understand why. Petrofac, a former member of the FTSE 100 index in the days of higher oil prices, is still a very big business. It has 13,500 employees, recorded revenues last year of $7.9bn (\u00a36bn) and has an order-book of contracts worth $14.3bn. Shareholders will also have reflected that SFO investigations tend to take ages and, even when the company admits criminal activity (which Petrofac doesn\u2019t), the process can conclude these days with a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, and the payment of a financial penalty that can be chunky but not life-threatening. That semi-reassuring view of potential risks has been undermined by Petrofac\u2019s latest announcement. In its effort to display cooperation with the SFO, the board has suspended chief operating officer Marwan Chedid \u2013 but the prosecuting agency still seems unhappy. The SFO does not deem Petrofac to have cooperated with it \u201cas that term is used in relevant SFO and sentencing guidelines\u201d. The language is important: it could mean that the option of a DPA will not be offered; should events run that way. To complete investors\u2019 misery, Petrofac reported that the findings of its internal investigation \u2013 which concluded there was no evidence of payment of bribes \u2013 had not been accepted by the SFO. Cue a further 30% plunge in the share price. It has now halved in a fortnight. Aside from the direct uncertainty around the SFO\u2019s investigation, Petrofac\u2019s day-to-day operations will be hampered by Chedid\u2019s absence. He is righthand man to Ayman Asfari, Petrofac\u2019s chief executive, 18% shareholder and driving force since the 1990s. And, to put it mildly, replenishing the order-book will not be made any easier by the shadow of the SFO inquiry. Could the board have handled the crisis differently? In theory, it could also have suspended Asfari, who, like Chedid, was arrested, questioned under caution by the SFO and released without charge a fortnight ago. Two senior suspensions might have satisfied the SFO\u2019s definition of full cooperation during an investigation. But one can see why the board rejected that option. Asfari, with his network of contacts in the Middle East plus a role as a UK trade ambassador, is the public face of Petrofac and the man who makes the company tick. The danger of corporate meltdown would have felt real. Removing Asfari from all matters related to the SFO investigation was probably the best pragmatic fudge. Yet, if the length of SFO investigations initially sounded helpful for Petrofac\u2019s ability to operate normally, the logic has been turned on its head. Chedid is suspended until further notice and Asfari must try to bring in more contracts in near-impossible circumstances. This is a deep crisis and the correct share price is anybody\u2019s guess.

Give it time, seems to be the tune from Vienna, but it is sounding fainter. When Opec embarked on this strategy last November, it surely expected better results.

      "body": "<p>When the Serious Fraud Office announced two weeks ago it was investigating suspected bribery, corruption and money laundering at Petrofac, shares in the oil services firm fell 14%. It was a sharp reaction to serious news, but it didn\u2019t suggest outright panic in the ranks of investors.</p> <p>One could understand why. Petrofac, a former member of the FTSE 100 index in the days of higher oil prices, is still a very big business. It has 13,500 employees, recorded revenues last year of $7.9bn (\u00a36bn) and has an order-book of contracts worth $14.3bn.</p> <p>Shareholders will also have reflected that SFO investigations tend to take ages and, even when the company admits criminal activity (which Petrofac doesn\u2019t), the process can conclude these days with a deferred prosecution agreement, or DPA, and the payment of a financial penalty that can be chunky but not life-threatening. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/25/opec-meeting-oil-price-saudi-arabia-production\">Oil price slides as Opec production cuts fail to impress markets</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That semi-reassuring view of potential risks has been undermined by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/25/petrofac-suspends-coo-sfo-investigation-oil-services\">Petrofac\u2019s latest announcement</a>. In its effort to display cooperation with the SFO, the board has suspended chief operating officer Marwan Chedid \u2013 but the prosecuting agency still seems unhappy. The SFO does not deem Petrofac to have cooperated with it \u201cas that term is used in relevant SFO and sentencing guidelines\u201d. The language is important: it could mean that the option of a DPA will not be offered; should events run that way.</p> <p>To complete investors\u2019 misery, Petrofac reported that the findings of its internal investigation \u2013 which concluded there was no evidence of payment of bribes \u2013 had not been accepted by the SFO. Cue a further 30% plunge in the share price. It has now halved in a fortnight.</p> <p>Aside from the direct uncertainty around the SFO\u2019s investigation, Petrofac\u2019s day-to-day operations will be hampered by Chedid\u2019s absence. He is righthand man to Ayman Asfari, Petrofac\u2019s chief executive, 18% shareholder and driving force since the 1990s. And, to put it mildly, replenishing the order-book will not be made any easier by the shadow of the SFO inquiry.</p> <p>Could the board have handled the crisis differently? In theory, it could also have suspended Asfari, who, like Chedid, was arrested, questioned under caution by the SFO and released without charge a fortnight ago.

      "bodyText": "Neither of the two main parties \u201chas set out an honest set of choices\u201d to the public over their tax and spending plans, the Institute of Fiscal Studies has said. In a critical assessment of the Conservative and Labour party manifestos, the thinktank said both parties presented a misleading picture of the impact their polices would have over the course of the next parliament. It warned that neither addressed the long-term challenges facing the UK. The Tory focus on cutting immigration risked a \u00a36bn hit to the exchequer and the plans for continued austerity could prove impossible to deliver without causing serious damage to services, the IFS said. Labour\u2019s proposals would raise spending to its highest level since the mid-1980s and tax levels to record levels in peacetime, the thinktank said. But the party\u2019s plans for tax hikes aimed at top earners and businesses may \u201cnot raise anything like\u201d the \u00a348.6bn claimed and its proposals could turn out to be economically damaging, it added. The warning came as all the main parties resumed campaigning following a pause after the Manchester attack. Labour has closed the gap in opinion polls since its manifesto launch, which included a boost in spending on the NHS, schools and the abolition of university tuition fees. Theresa May promised to increase spending on long-term care, though her plan to make those who suffer long-term illnesses pay the most proved to be unpopular and was quickly dropped in favour of an unspecified spending cap. The thinktank\u2019s deputy director, Carl Emmerson, accused Labour of \u201cpretending that everything can be paid for\u201d under plans to raise taxes on the richest, many of whom will avoid paying higher rates of tax. \u201cThe shame of the two big parties\u2019 manifestos is that neither sets out an honest set of choices. Neither addresses the long-term challenges we face. For Labour, we can have pretty much everything \u2013 free higher education, free childcare, more spending on pay, health, infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the pretence is that can all be funded by faceless corporations and \u2018the rich\u2019. The case [for higher taxes] needs to be made with honesty about what it would mean for tax payments, not pretending that everything can be paid for by \u2018someone else\u2019.\u201d Turning to the Tory plans, he criticised the Tories for proposing five more years of austerity that were unlikely to be \u201cdeliverable\u201d. Emmerson said a Tory government would be forced to either pull back on spending cuts or increase taxes to prevent further cuts in the NHS and schools from hitting services. \u201cThe Conservatives simply offer the cuts already promised. Additional funding pledges for the NHS and schools are just confirming that spending would rise in a way broadly consistent with the March budget,\u201d he said. \u201cCompared with Labour, they are offering a relatively smaller state and consequently lower taxes. With that offer come unacknowledged risks to the quality of public services.\u201d Emmerson dismissed Theresa May\u2019s plans to reduce benefits to the elderly by means testing the winter fuel payment and scrapping the pensions triple-lock as offering \u201cwholly trivial\u201d savings. And he said the manifesto U-turn over a cap on care costs would result in \u201cpresumably increasing public spending overall\u201d. The Tory commitment to get net migration down to the tens of thousands risked harming the economy, particularly when coupled with the ageing British population, Emmerson said. \u201cTheir continued focus on reducing immigration would, if effective, cause considerable economic damage as well as creating an additional problem for the public finances\u201d. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Labour\u2019s manifesto already took into account attempts by the richest individuals and corporations to avoid new higher rates of tax. \u201cWe believe the IFS has underestimated the revenue raising effectiveness of some of the tax changes we would make, but we recognise the potential for uncertainty which is why we have allowed headroom in our plans,\u201d he said. McDonnell said the IFS agreed that Labour would achieve a budget surplus in the last year of the parliament of around \u00a320bn. And while this sum was smaller than the Tory target, he said it was more likely to be achieved. \u201cThe IFS confirms that Labour are on target to meet our manifesto commitments in regards to our fiscal credibility rule, to balance the budget on day to day spending in the coming parliament and have debt falling as a share of GDP as we have committed,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThe IFS assessment of the Conservatives is clear: their plans would damage our economy and public services with five more years of damaging austerity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Bike and car parts retailer Halfords has reported a surge in demand for electric bikes. Sales of e-bikes soared 130% over the year at Halfords, helping to increase its total cycle sales by more than 5%. They start at just under \u00a3500, with a top-of-the-range model \u2013 which promises a top speed without pedalling of 15mph \u2013 costing \u00a32,299. Its chief executive, Jill McDonald, said: \u201cSales are hitting a tipping point as people understand what e-bikes are.\u201d She said they made cycling accessible to many older people and Halfords has tripled the number of outlets where the battery-assisted bikes are available. It has also trained all its staff to sell them and has increased its range. E-bikes now make up 4% of the chain\u2019s total bike sales. However, the retailer\u2019s underlying profits still fell 7.5% to \u00a375.4m, largely down to fall in the pound\u2019s value since the Brexit vote, which increased the cost of buying goods from overseas. McDonald said cutting better deals with suppliers and improving efficiency as well as raising some prices had only partly offset the impact of sterling\u2019s fall against the dollar. Nearly all bikes are bought in dollars. McDonald said prices for premium bikes sold at independent retailers had risen by as much as 15%, while most mainstream operators had increased prices by 4% to 5%. She insisted Halfords\u2019 prices had risen less than that. McDonald, who is leaving Halfords in October to become head of non-food including clothing at Marks &amp; Spencer, said the cycle market still had good growth prospects: \u201cPeople want to get fit and healthier and cycling is an affordable low impact way to get fitter,\u201d she said.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK economy slowed even more sharply than first thought in the opening months of this year as rising prices in the wake of the Brexit vote took their toll on consumer spending. The Office for National Statistics said GDP grew just 0.2% in the first quarter of 2017, a marked change of pace from the 0.7% growth in the final three months of 2016. Statisticians had previously estimated the economy grew 0.3% in the first quarter. There was no growth at all in the first quarter in GDP per head, which adjusts for the size of the population and is generally seen as a better guide to prosperity than mere GDP. The figures provide the latest evidence that the early resilience to the EU referendum result last June is now wearing off as higher inflation puts consumers under pressure. Prices have been picking up pace since the Brexit vote because it sent the pound sharply lower and has raised the cost of imports to the UK. That higher inflation has hit household budgets and dented the key driver of UK growth, consumer spending. The ONS highlighted that pattern in its updated estimate of GDP growth on Thursday. \u201cUK GDP growth slowed to 0.2% in quarter one of 2017 as consumer-facing industries such as retail and accommodation fell and household spending slowed. This was partly due to rising prices,\u201d it said in the data release. \u201cConstruction and manufacturing also showed little growth, while business services and finance continued to grow strongly.\u201d Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, noted that first-quarter growth was below what the Bank of England and most City economists had been expecting. \u201cThe outcome was in line with our forecast, but below the consensus expectation for 0.3% quarter-on-quarter and the BoE \u2013 in the fullness of time \u2013 expects the growth rate to be 0.4%,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is disappointing and like driving down the motorway at 20mph instead of 70mph.\u201d The Bank said earlier this month that it expected GDP growth would edge up marginally to 1.9% for 2017 as a whole from growth of 1.8% in 2016. But it warned that living standards would fall this year because inflation would be higher than pay growth. Kallum Pickering, economist at the bank Berenberg was among those commentators predicting growth would pick up again after the first-quarter lull. \u201cShould we be concerned? No, the dip is probably temporary,\u201d he said. \u201cWith both soft and hard data improving in the second quarter, the quarterly growth rate is likely to rebound to 0.4%.\u201d Ian Stewart, chief economist at the consultancy Deloitte was also optimistic the economy could continue expanding despite the pressure on household incomes. \u201cHigh inflation is hitting consumers, but a weak pound and a recovering global economy are helping businesses. UK growth is likely to tilt away from the consumer towards exports, manufacturing and investment this year. This should keep the UK economy growing at a similar rate to last year,\u201d he said. Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said that given the discrepancy between the weak first quarter GDP data and upbeat surveys, there was \u201ca good chance that the figure is revised back up in time\u201d. She also noted quarterly 0.6% rise in business investment, \u201csuggesting that Brexit uncertainty has not significantly weighed on firms\u2019 spending plans\u201d. Gregory added: \u201cWe have not altered our view that the economy will remain fundamentally resilient in the coming quarters.\u201d Separate figures on housebuilding provided some reassurance on the outlook. The Department for Communities and Local Government said 43,170 new houses were started in England between January and March, up 3% on the previous quarter and up 21% on a year earlier. The number of completed houses rose to 39,520, about 9% higher than the previous quarter and 21% higher than a year ago. Andy Frankish at the Mortgage Advice Bureau said: \u201cThe latest figures do indicate a marginal increase and we can see the signs of recovery starting in 2013, demonstrating the impact of the introduction of help to buy, which could suggest an element of cautious optimism that the industry has perhaps \u2018turned the corner\u2019 following the trough of 2009. \u201cBut if we are to reach the 200,000-plus new-build homes needed each year in England, there is still more momentum required.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The retirement age in Britain and other leading developed countries will need to rise to 70 by the middle of the century to head off the biggest pension crisis in history, according to the World Economic Forum. The body that runs the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos said deficits in the world\u2019s six largest pension systems would more than quadruple to $224tn by 2050 unless people worked longer and saved more. With people born today having a life expectancy of more than 100, the WEF said the cost of providing security in retirement for a rapidly ageing population was the financial equivalent of climate change. It warned the huge and spiralling cost would imperil the incomes of future generations and set the industrial world up for the biggest pension crisis in history. The WEF said it had examined the world\u2019s six biggest pension saving systems \u2013 the US, the UK, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia \u2013 and found that all were coming under strain from an expected global increase in the numbers over-65s rising from 600 million to 2.1 billion in 2050. \u201cThe anticipated increase in longevity and resulting ageing populations is the financial equivalent of climate change,\u201d said Michael Drexler, head of financial and infrastructure systems at the WEF. \u201cWe must address it now or accept that its adverse consequences will haunt future generations, putting an impossible strain on our children and grandchildren.\u201d Adding in China and India, which have the world\u2019s largest populations, the combined savings gap for the eight countries reached $400tn by 2050, a sum five times the size of the current global economy. The report based its estimates of the pension savings gap on the amount of money needed to provide every person with a retirement income equal of 70% of their pre-retirement income. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a target of 70% of pre-retirement income roughly equates to an unchanged standard of living because once people retire they save less and pay less tax. The WEF said the funding gap would continue to grow at a rate higher than the expected economic growth rate, often 4% to 5% a year, driven in part by the effects of an ageing population: a growing population of retirees who are expected to live longer in retirement. Although Britain\u2019s retirement age is due to rise to 67 between 2026 and 2028, the WEF said further increases would be needed to forestall a predicted increase in the pension savings\u2019 gap from a current $8tn to $33tn by 2050. Half the children born in 2007 could expect to live until they were 103, putting a strain on the pension system. The pension savings\u2019 gap in the US is forecast to rise almost fivefold from $28bn to $137bn by the middle of the century. The report praised the UK for its decision to ensure that 8% of earnings will automatically be saved in a pension for each individual after 2019, noting that auto-enrolment had already boosted saving by 22- to 29-year-olds and low income workers by $2.5bn a year. \u201cThe retirement savings challenge is at crisis point and the time to act is now,\u201d said Jacques Goulet, president of health and wealth at Mercer, a financial services firm that helped the WEF produce the report. \u201cThere is no one \u2018silver bullet\u2019 solution to solve the retirement gap. Individuals need to increase their personal savings and financial literacy, while the private sector and governments should provide programmes to support them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s structural reforms will not be enough to arrest its rising debt and another credit rating downgrade for the country is possible unless it gets its ballooning borrowing in check, two officials at Moody\u2019s ratings agency have said. Doubling down on comments earlier this week that China\u2019s financial strength will be eroded because of huge corporate and household debt, Moody\u2019s said the country\u2019s \u201cvast reform agenda\u201d would not be enough to prevent borrowing from weighing on economic growth. China may no longer get an A1 rating if there were signs that debt was growing at a pace that exceeded Moody\u2019s expectations, Li Xiujun, vice president of credit strategy and standards at the ratings agency, said in a webcast with his colleague Marie Diron. \u201cIf in the future China\u2019s structural reforms can prevent its leverage from rising more effectively without increasing risks in the banking and shadow banking sector, then it will have a positive impact on China\u2019s rating,\u201d Li said. But Li added: \u201cIf there are signs that China\u2019s debt will keep rising and the rate of growth is beyond our expectations, leading to serious capital misallocation, then it will continue to weigh on economic growth in the medium term and impact the sovereign rating negatively. \u201cChina may no longer suit the requirement of A1 rating.\u201d The authorities were furious with the agency\u2019s decision to downgrade its sovereign rating one notch to A1 from Aa3 and the latest comments are likely to cause continued irritation in Beijing. Although any impact on sovereign borrowing costs will be slight, China dislikes criticism of its economic policy. The finance ministry denied that growth would suffer while a front-pade editorial in the People\u2019s Daily called Moody\u2019s \u201csloppy\u201d and said the agency decision was based on inappropriate methodology, exaggerating difficulties facing the economy and underestimating the government\u2019s reform efforts. Government-led stimulus has been a major driver of China\u2019s economic growth over recent years, but has also been accompanied by runaway credit growth that has created a mountain of debt \u2013 now standing at nearly 300% of gross domestic product (GDP). \u201cThe financial and policy capacity that the Chinese government has to implement such measures and to mitigate some of the default risks is a very important element in supporting the rating at A1, which is the fifth highest rating in our tier, and our view that the outlook of that rating level is stable,\u201d said Diron, who is associate managing director of Moody\u2019s sovereign risk group. China has vowed to lower its debt level by rolling out measures such as debt-to-equity swaps, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) mixed-ownership reforms, reduction of excess capacity, and more recently regulatory tightening in the shadow banking sector. But authorities are also keen to meet official economic growth targets, and moves so far have been cautious, especially heading into a political leadership reshuffle later this year. While Moody\u2019s expects China\u2019s growth to slow to around 5% in coming years, from 6.7% last year, the economy would remain robust, and the likelihood of a hard landing was slim, Diron said.",
