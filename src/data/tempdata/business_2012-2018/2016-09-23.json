      "bodyText": "A warning about the impact of the Brexit vote on financial services jobs has been issued by the head of the London Stock Exchange. Xavier Rolet said at least 100,000 positions could be lost if the City loses its ability to process euro-denominated transactions. Rolet \u2013 who has also insisted he does not think London will be stripped of its role in the (\u00a3440bn-a-day clearing business \u2013 said on Friday that jobs would be lost across the UK and not just in the capital\u2019s financial district. \u201cWe estimate, conservatively, that at a very minimum 100,000 jobs, in risk management, compliance, middle office, back-office support functions \u2013 by the way not just in London, up and down the country \u2013 are implicated in supporting this business and clearly could be at risk,\u201d the Frenchman told Bloomberg Television on Friday. \u201cBut the point is that there are very, very few financial centres around the world that could accommodate such a global business,\u201d said Rolet, who has agreed a \u00a320bn merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse. The role London plays in handling trades through clearing houses such as London Clearing House, in which the LSE has a stake, has proved contentious even before the result of the 23 June referendum. Last year, an EU court in Luxembourg ruled that the European Central Bank lacked the powers to dictate clearing of euro-denominated trades. Rolet told Bloomberg it was possible that business could move. \u201cIs it possible that the whole thing could move? \u201cOf course it is \u2026 the London Stock Exchange Group via the London Clearing House operates a very successful clearing business and is currently licensed to operate in for example, in what I believe could be frankly the only logical alternative to London, if that came to pass, and that is the New York market. \u201cThe physical possibility of moving, as well as the economic consequences, are rather complex. \u201cThe notion of separating, for example, the clearing of euro-denominated interest-rate swaps from US dollar-denominated interest-rate swaps, just doesn\u2019t make any economic sense and probably cannot be achieved, even from a regulatory or legal standpoint.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It has moody black and white images and a poetic voiceover with a social message. The words \u201cwe are blind\u201d accompany images of a crowd walking past a woman sitting in a doorway. Few would guess, when the images are screened in an interval of Sunday\u2019s X Factor, that they are an advert for NatWest bank. The campaign is part of an effort by the bank\u2019s owner, Royal Bank of Scotland, to distance itself from the empire-building ethos of Fred Goodwin, who plastered the RBS logo on Formula One cars and across Edinburgh airport. The aim now is to run two separate banking brands: NatWest in England and Wales and \u201cthe Royal Bank\u201d for its high street business in Scotland. David Wheldon, chief marketing officer of RBS, said the 73% taxpayer-owned bank had decided not to ditch entirely the RBS name, which will be retained for the group\u2019s name on the stock market and parent company. Another idea to turn RBS into lower case rbs was considered and thrown out. \u201cWe are stepping back from this notion we are building a global brand,\u201d said Wheldon, who refused to disclose how much the new campaign had cost. Adverts for Scottish audience \u2013 with the slogan \u201cThe Royal Bank for Scotland\u201d \u2013 will be aired during Saturday\u2019s X Factor. The focus is on \u201cthe Royal Bank\u201d, the way Wheldon said customers in Scotland referred to their bank, rather than RBS, a name which is likely to be linked to the financial crash for decades to come. \u201cThe reputation that is really damaged is the RBS reputation,\u201d said Wheldon. \u201cFor loyal customers, the reputation of \u2018the Royal Bank\u2019 is not as damaged.\u201d After a \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, a string of fines and allegations about its treatment of small business customers, the bank is now attempting to put its \u201clegacy issues\u201d behind it. The ad campaigns are being launched as Ross McEwan begins his fourth year as chief executive amid the ongoing uncertainty of a fine for mis-selling mortgage bonds in the US. Last week, fears that Deutsche Bank could be facing a $14bn penalty dented RBS\u2019s share price, which was 363p when McEwan took the helm but is 182p now. A further hit to its reputation is expected from the publication of the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s investigation into its treatment of small business customers. McEwan must also spin off 300 branches \u2013 imposed by the EU as a penalty for its bailout \u2013 which will eventually mean there will be no RBS branches in England and Wales and no NatWest branches in Scotland. Already delayed, the spin-off risks turning into a farce after Santander last week pulled out of talks to buy the branches. It also means that RBS branches in England and Wales will stay for the time being. The plan to rebrand them Williams &amp; Glyn on the high street has been put aside. RBS also has to set out how it will ringfence its high street bank from its investment banking operations; rumour has it that the bank is close to finalising a plan. Once it is done, it might make it easier to split up RBS, but, Wheldon said: \u201cWe are one bank and we want to stay one bank and a bank of brands.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Viagogo is the brainchild of American tech guru Eric Baker, 43, who also co-founded ticketing website StubHub before selling it to eBay for $310m in a deal believed to have made him more than $30m. Viagogo has grown rapidly, exploiting huge demand for live events by providing a marketplace for people to resell tickets \u2013 often at a hefty mark-up \u2013 and taking a commission. A fundraising effort in 2009 valued the company at $300m but it is believed to have grown significantly since. However, since it moved from the UK to Switzerland in 2012 its financial accounts are private. Its investors include tennis power couple Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi, Bernard Arnault, chief executive of luxury brand LVMH, and financier Jacob Rothschild. It also secured investment from brothers Saul and Robin Klein, the latter of whom is on the board of Tech City UK, an initiative set up by former British prime minister David Cameron. While Viagogo advertises some tickets at face value or below, it has also become notorious for wildly inflated prices for the hottest events. Two tickets for this December\u2019s El Clasico, the grudge football match between Real Madrid and Barcelona, are currently listed for \u00a3196,155.94. If tickets sell at that price then Viagogo\u2019s \u201cbooking fee\u201dwould top \u00a340,000. It would also take a commission from the seller, typically about 15% of the ticket price. The website says this fee is \u201cwhat allows us to provide you with our great service\u201d. Social media sites, however, are littered with angry customers complaining that they had been refused entry or had difficulty getting their money back. Viagogo may advertise tickets with a huge price tag, but it prefers to keep a low profile about its own operations. While the firm is now technically based in Geneva, much of Viagogo\u2019s business is administered from an office in Cannon Street in London, where dozens of staff field calls from customers. When the Guardian visited the office, Viagogo\u2019s name did not appear on the foyer information board listing the building\u2019s tenants.

Viagogo, an online marketplace that allows people to resell tickets, lists hundreds of tickets for next year\u2019s ICC Champions Trophy. But the event is not yet on public sale and consumer protection laws prohibit companies from advertising products they do not have. \u201cThe ICC Champions Trophy 2017 ballot is open until 30 September and therefore no tickets have been allocated yet,\u201d said a spokesman for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). \u201cThis means that any tickets currently being advertised on secondary ticketing sites do not exist and cannot be guaranteed. \u201cThe ECB are monitoring this situation with the ICC and are taking the appropriate legal measures against these sites. We strongly recommend that cricket fans around the world buy their tickets only via the official ballot at icc-cricket.com/tickets.\u201d The threat of legal action against Viagogo, which has a large office in London but is technically based in Switzerland, comes amid efforts by the music and sports industries to crack down on ticket resale sites and the touts who profit from them. Mike Andrews, who leads the eCrime team at National Trading Standards, confirmed that advertising tickets before they were available, with no information about seat numbers or face value, breached consumer rights law. \u201cWe increasingly see unofficial ticket vendors offering tickets to major events before they have actually gone on sale, which can be tempting for fans who want to guarantee their place at a sports tournament or other major event,\u201d he said. \u201cThese tickets are usually sold without basic information such as seat number or face value, which is prohibited under new laws passed last year and we strongly advise fans to avoid purchasing tickets from unofficial sellers.\u201d Viagogo and rivals such as StubHub and GetMeIn are also understood to be facing the prospect of a full-blown investigation by regulators. \u201cEnforcement agencies are looking closely at this issue and there is a possibility of enforcement action in due course,\u201d said a senior regulatory source. Viagogo has also come under fire for advertising tickets whose terms and conditions explicitly forbid their resale, meaning fans risk being refused entry. The Geneva-based website recently listed tickets to the Radio 1Xtra show in Liverpool, featuring artists such as Stormzy and Sean Paul. \u201cTickets for 1Xtra Live \u2026 are individually barcoded and anyone trying to get in with a resold or transferred ticket not purchased legitimately via 1Xtra may be refused entry or ejected from the venue,\u201d said 1Xtra. Secondary ticketing, the name for tickets that are resold as opposed to \u201cprimary\u201d tickets released at face value, has attracted increasing scrutiny of late. Bands such as Pixies and Mumford and Sons have condemned the industry, while fans were left outraged by touts using the sites to advertise tickets to the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play for up to \u00a38,000. However, a government-backed review of the industry by Prof Michael Waterson, which recommended several measures to curb touting, has met with no response from ministers. Waterson said at a recent music industry event that he feared the issue had been \u201cpushed into the long grass\u201d. The Competition and Markets Authority is expected to release a report into the industry next month, which could task a body such as Trading Standards with launching a dedicated investigation. Trading Standards has so far struggled to address ticketing because its budget for policing rogue traders has been slashed. The secondary ticketing industry is worth an estimated \u00a31bn a year, based on transaction details from the four biggest sites. Reg Walker, of anti-touting consultancy Iridium, said: \u201cWhat is the point of passing consumer protection laws if there\u2019s nobody to enforce it? I would like to see HMRC, Trading Standards and police launch a full investigation into Viagogo and its activities. \u201cWhy is nobody protecting the consumer? Why are the authorities running scared of these big companies?\u201d FanFair Alliance, an organisation set up to combat touting for music events, urged swift action against Viagogo and its rivals. \u201cWe urgently need government action and proper enforcement of the law.

      "bodyText": "Before we close up for the day, here is a summary of the main events: Surprise news from Sports Direct, which has appointed Mike Ashley chief executive following the resignation of Dave Forsey There were mixed reactions to the news, with shares in the retailer rising but some commentators raising eyebrows at Ashley\u2019s appointment Jim O\u2019Neill resigned as Treasury minister - the first ministerial resignation since Theresa May became PM European and US markets are down, as the boost fades from the Fed\u2019s decision on Wednesday to hold rates Weaker than expected flash PMIs suggest growth slowed in the eurozone at the end of the second quarter French GDP was revised down, to show negative growth of -0.1% in the second quarter That\u2019s all for this week. Thank you for joining us, and for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back on Monday, have a great weekend. AM Growth in America\u2019s manufacturing sector slowed in September according to Markit\u2019s flash PMI. The index slipped to 51.4 from 52 in August, where anything above 50 signals expansion. Tim Moore, Senior Economist at IHS Markit: Despite the growth setback in September, manufacturers appear reasonably upbeat about their longer-term prospects. Reflecting this, job creation rebounded since August and input buying continued to expand at a notably faster pace than seen during the first half of the year. At the same time, overall cost inflation remained marginal and this provided some headroom to stimulate client spending through price discounting. The pound hit a five-week low against the dollar, falling more than 1% to $1.2938. It is currently down 0.9% at $1.2951. US markets are down in early trading: Dow Jones: -0.1% at 18,374 S&amp;P 500: -0.2% at 2,172 Nasdaq: -0.2% at 5,328 As Wall Street opens, here is the latest from European markets: FTSE 100: -0.1% at 6,908 Germany\u2019s DAX: -0.4% at 10,634 France\u2019s CAC: -0.5% at 4,486 Spain\u2019s IBEX: -1.5% at 8,801 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: -1.2% at 16,438 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: -0.8% at 345 We have the first inkling that the sharp drop in the pound following the June Brexit vote is encouraging more overseas visitors. Some 3.8 million people visited Britain from other countries in July, the highest monthly total on record and 2% more than a year earlier according to the Office for National Statistics. Visitors spent 2% more this July compared with a year earlier, at \u00a31.79bn on a seasonally adjusted basis. The pound\u2019s sharp fall makes British goods and services cheaper for people visiting from other countries. Meanwhile the figures also revealed British holidaymakers\u2019 cut their spending overseas in July. Read our full story: George Osborne has praised Jim O\u2019Neill, the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs who resigned today as a Treasury minister. O\u2019Neill was part of the Treasury team when Osborne was chancellor. Wall Street is expected to open slightly lower following a three day rally. But US shares are likely to end the week higher, after the Fed\u2019s decision to leave interest rates on hold boosted investor sentiment and drove shares higher on Thursday. The Labour Party has responded to Mike Ashley\u2019s appointment as chief executive of Sports Direct, the retailer he founded. Jon Trickett MP, the shadow business secretary, is sceptical: Swapping the deck chairs around is not the solution - it\u2019s the underlying culture at Sports Direct that needs to be challenged and changed. Whether Mike Ashley - who has presided over Sports Direct\u2019s objectionable working practices for years - is the right man to bring about the change needed is questionable. He will need to end the bullying culture at the company, get rid of zero-hours contracts, stop their over-reliance on agency workers and address the high levels of workplace injuries. Oxford Economics is back on \u201crecession watch\u201d and say the chances of the UK economy sliding into another one are 25%, unchanged from last week. Given his agreement with George Osborne about the importance of the northern powerhouse, it will be interesting to see whether he pops up at the former chancellor\u2019s new thinktank - the Northern Powerhouse Partnership. This is what Jim O\u2019Neill told Theresa May in his resignation letter: Dear Prime Minister, I have decided to resign as a minister in the government. This morning I returned from New York where I had the pleasure of witnessing the UN high level agreement on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) which is essentially the end goal of the Review that I was asked to lead ion the spring of 2014. This part of my role in government has come to its natural end, although of course, I was asked initially to lead the Review, independent of government. Leading this Review has been one of the most stimulating roles I have ever undertaken and I am grateful to all those involved, especially my Review team, and all those across government that allowed the UK to take such a global leadership position in this key threat to the world. It goes without saying that our success is symbolic of the way that the UK can be influential in a post Brexit world. I joined the government with the AMR Review already well developed in terms of our ideas and influence, but entered office believing its goals would be enhanced by being a Minister. I primarily joined however for the specific purpose of helping deliver the Northern Powerhouse and to help boost our economic ties with key growing economies around the world, especially China and India and other rapidly emerging economies. The case for both to be at the heart of British economic policy is even stronger following the referendum, and I am pleased that, despite speculation to the contrary, both appear to be commanding your personal attention. I am leaving knowing that I can play some role supporting these critical initiatives as a non-governmental person. I look forward to moving to the cross benches of the Lords, and wish you every success with the exciting challenges and opportunities ahead, and thank you for allowing me the privilege to serve in government. Yours sincerely, Jim O\u2019Neill Ed Cox, director of the thinktank, IPPR North, says it\u2019s a shame O\u2019Neill has quit the Treasury, but suggests the North will power on regardless... It is a great shame that Jim O\u2019Neill is standing down from this important role as he has been an important champion within government for the Northern Powerhouse. The Prime Minister has been very clear in her support for the Northern Powerhouse and IPPR North has always argued that the Northern Powerhouse is not so much a government programme as the sum total of economic activity that makes up our \u00a3300bn economy. Ministers will come and go, but it is the businesses, innovators and investors in the North that will ultimately unlock our economic potential. More reaction from political journalists to the news that Jim O\u2019Neill has quit as a Treasury minister. He is thought to be unhappy with Theresa May\u2019s stance on a number of issues, including grammar schools, the northern powerhouse, and China. Jim O\u2019Neill, the former Goldman Sachs chief economist who coined the phrase \u201cBrics\u201d, has resigned from the Treasury. He was appointed in May 2015 as part of George Osborne\u2019s Treasury team, and was a key proponent of the Northern Powerhouse. He was also made a Conservative life peer. O\u2019Neill grew up in Gatley, on the southern outskirts of Manchester, and is probably best known for coming up with the phrase \u201cBrics\u201d to describe the rapid economic rise of Brazil, Russia, India and China, in 2001. The FT\u2019s Jim Pickard says O\u2019Neill has resigned for a number of reasons, including Theresa May\u2019s desire to expand grammar schools. The Green Party has waded into the Sports Direct debate, calling on Mike Ashley to resign as chief executive. Jonathan Bartley, co-leader of the party: \u201ct is a huge concern that Mike Ashley, a man who apparently allowed Sports Direct to treat its workers so badly, is now considered the right person to take over as chief executive. As someone who has admitted to taking his eye off the ball, there will be little confidence from those who work for Sports Direct in his ability to address the mess that the company is in. He should consider his position and whether he should step aside in favour of someone more capable and with a proven track record of standing up for employee interests. Investors appear to disagree, with shares in Sports Direct up almost 5% in current trading. Thee pound has dipped below $1.30, currently down 0.6% at $1.2996. It is also down 0.7% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1591. The Co-operative Group\u2019s pre-tax profit more than halved in the first half of 2016 to \u00a317m, but it insisted its three-year turnaround plan was on track. Profits were held back by its investment in a large-scale rebranding of its grocery stores and funeral homes as it attempts to move on from darker times when the banking arm almost collapsed in 2013/14. Profits were also reduced pay rises for frontline staff and price cuts at its supermarkets. The group has also written down the value of its investment in the Co-operative Bank by \u00a345m. It now owns just 20% of the bank, after parts of the division were sold off in response to a \u00a31.5bn black hole. The pain of the past - exacerbated considerably the drugs scandal that engulfed the former chairman of the banking division, Paul Flowers - has triggered a rebrand. The Co-op Group has looked back to its roots to move forward, scrapping its lime-green shop frontages and replacing them with the group\u2019s blue cloverleaf-like design, first introduced in 1968. Stephen Brown, European economist at Capital Economics, says the weak eurozone PMI suggests the economy is too weak to push inflation higher. (Headline consumer inflation is just 0.2% in the single currency bloc.) This will put further pressure on the European Central Bank to pump more stimulus into the economy, he says September\u2019s fall in the eurozone composite PMI to a 20-month low implies that the already sluggish pace of expansion in the currency union lost further momentum at the end of the quarter. Overall, today\u2019s PMIs suggest that growth slowed at the end of Q3 and that economic conditions remain too weak to push core inflation back up towards the ECB\u2019s target. As such, pressure on the ECB to take further policy action will continue to mount. We expect it to announce an extension of its asset purchase programme in December, if not before. And finally for the flash PMIs, this morning the eurozone-wide survey suggested growth edged lower in September. The composite index edged down to a 20-month low of 52.6 from 52.9 in August. The manufacturing sector was stronger than services in the single currency bloc. Rob Dobson, senior economist at IHS Markit said: The eurozone economy ended the third quarter on a disappointing note, with its rate of expansion easing to a 20-month low in September. While the underlying picture remains one of sluggish growth of close to 0.3% over the quarter as a whole, it also remains clear that the economic upturn is still fragile and failing to achieve any real traction. Job creation is wavering as a result, with employment rising at the slowest pace since April. Slower growth in the German power house and elsewhere in the currency union suggest the upturn will remain uneven by country heading into the final quarter. Shares in Sports Direct are up 7% or 20 at 308p, making it the FTSE 250\u2019s biggest riser. No word as yet from investor groups that have pressured the retailer to hold an independent inquiry to working practices and corporate governance. (Sports Direct agreed to that earlier this week.) David Schneider\u2019s take on this morning\u2019s management changes at Sports Direct: Over in Germany, there are signs that the private sector is losing momentum... A combination of manufacturing and services PMIs for Germany showed output grew at the slowest rate in 16 months in September, held back by the services sector. The flash composite index fell to 52.7 from 53.3, disappointing economists\u2019 expectations. The services sector grew at the slowest rate in more than three years, edging close to stagnation. The manufacturing sector fared better, growing at the fastest rate in three months in September. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at IHS Markit said: The upturn in Germany\u2019s private sector economy is losing further momentum, with latest survey data pointing to the slowest expansion in output for nearly one-and-a-half years. A big concern is the divergent trends within the economy, with service provides struggling to eke out any meaningful growth. Today\u2019s survey data are a clear indication that German economic growth has slowed in the third quarter. While further GDP growth is expected, it is highly unlikely that the 0.7% rate seen at the beginning of the year will be repeated. Growth might have been revised down for the second quarter, but the latest snapshot from the French economy suggests the private sector was in better-than-expected shape in September. Markit\u2019s flash French services PMI increased to 54.1, from 52.3 in August, where anything above 50 indicates expansion. It was a 15-month high, and better than the 52 predicted by economists. The French manufacturing sector shrank again in September, but not as much as August. The flash indicator picked up to 49.5 from 48.3. Combined, the two surveys indicated the private sector was in decent shape at the end of the third quarter. The composite index increased to a 15-month high of 53.3 in September, from 51.9 in August. This will boost hopes that the wider economy fared better in the third quarter than the second. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at IHS Markit said: French private sector output growth strengthened at the end of the third quarter, reaching its joint- fastest pace in over five years. That was thanks to an improved performance from the dominant service sector, offsetting manufacturing stagnation. The data raise hopes of a firmer GDP print for the third quarter after growth ground to a halt in Q2. Bad news for France, as growth for the second quarter is revised down to -0.1%, piling further pressure on President Francois Hollande ahead of the French election next spring. The French statistics office, INSEE, had previously estimated zero growth between April and June, following 0.7% growth in the first quarter of the year. It is the first time Europe\u2019s second largest economy contracted since the first quarter of 2013, and the slowdown was driven by a sharp drop in inventories. Household spending dropped 0.1%, while trade contributed 0.6%. It\u2019s red across the board this morning, with all major European indices down. The feel-good factor from the Fed\u2019s decision on Wednesday to hold rates is fading. The FTSE is off 21 points or 0.3% at 6,890. Joshua Raymond, market analyst at XTB.com, says he\u2019s surprised by the resignation of Dave Forsey, who has quit as Sports Direct\u2019s chief executive. He seemed to have come through the crisis over the firms working conditions with a vigour to rectify the problems despite huge pressure from the media and large shareholders. So it\u2019s a bit of a surprise, especially given the AGM has only just passed and that would have been the ideal moment to announce this. Raymond adds that Ashley\u2019s appointment as CEO tightens his grip on the retailer. The fact Mike Ashley immediately assumes the CEO role will keep a laser focused attention on the firm\u2019s ability to recover from the crisis. This point is even more pertinent given much of the concern focused on Ashley\u2019s power grip on all aspects of the retailer, a grip which has just become even stronger. Ashely is now founder, main shareholder, and chief executive. Shares in Sports Direct are up 0.7% in early trading, at 289p. Stepping away from Sports Direct for a moment, European markets are set for a subdued open according to IG: Karen Byers, Sports Direct\u2019s UK retail boss, has been promoted to the role of global head of operations in what will be a major role given the way the story has unfolded at the retailer. As head of UK retail she presumably had a lot to do with the Shirebrook warehouse... Ashley has described in the past her key role in the management team. He told the Times : Karen Byers runs Sports Direct. She runs the retail, all the money comes out the retail, [the warehouse workers and store managers] are her army. She is the person who sets the rules. Not me. She is not on the board because we won\u2019t waste her time. We always say, whatever happens, keep [her] going and we will all be all right. We will go through a dip now for a few years and [she] will bring us out the other side. Not Dave [Forsey], not Mike Ashley and not Sean Nevitt [head of buying]. Sean Nevitt becomes global head of commercial, both with immediate effect. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, gives this early take on the changes announced at Sports Direct this morning: The big news today is that the embattled CEO Dave Forsey has resigned with immediate effect. In these circumstances, the usual debate is whether he jumped or was pushed, but, even though he was Mike Ashley\u2019s right-hand man, it looks like he has simply done the honourable thing, given the recent criticisms of him in the Sports Direct working practices report and the likely outcome of the corporate governance review. Slightly bizarrely, the beleaguered Mike Ashley himself, who didn\u2019t do much to defend Dave when he appeared before the Select Committee of MPs, says in the statement that \u201cI feel like I have lost my right arm, but I do hope to have the opportunity to work with Dave again in the future\u201d. Mike Ashley was previously executive deputy chairman of Sports Direct, and he takes on the role of chief executive as the company attempts to restore its battered reputation. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how this one goes down in the City. Earlier this week, Sports Direct bowed to shareholder pressure by agreeing to an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance. It has been under pressure since a Guardian investigation found that warehouse staff at its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, were effectively being paid below the national minimum wage because of lengthy security checks. It exposed a climate of fear at the warehouse, with MPs later comparing it to a Victorian workhouse. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Big news this morning from the retail world. Mike Ashley, the embattled founder of Sports Direct, has been appointed chief executive of the retailer with immediate effect. His previous role at the company was It comes at a time when the company is under intense pressure over corporate governance and the way it treats its workers. The retailer has caved in to calls from MPs and shareholder groups to hold an independent inquiry into working practices, which were highlighted following a Guardian investigation. Ashley replaces his good pal and long-standing business partner, Dave Forsey, who resigned on Thursday according to the retailer in a statement this morning. Here is what they both had to say: Mike Ashley I feel like I have lost my right arm, but I do hope to have the opportunity to work with Dave again in the future. Dave Forsey I have given my entire working life to the company and in return the company has given me amazing opportunities and experiences. I wish everyone at Sports Direct well in the future.

      "bodyText": "Spending by UK visitors picked up in July, while British holidaymakers\u2019 cut their spending overseas, according to the first official figures on travel trends since the Brexit vote depressed the pound and made foreign holidays more expensive. The Office for National Statistics said foreign visitors, including tourists and those on business trips, spent 2% more this July than a year ago at \u00a31.79bn on a seasonally adjusted basis. UK visitors going overseas spent \u00a33.55bn, down 1% on a year earlier. The rise in spending by overseas visitors in July followed four months of falls and came as the sharp drop in the pound against the euro, dollar and other currencies boosted visitor spending power. Other reports have suggested British department stores enjoyed a boost to sales of watches and jewellery over the summer as foreign tourists exploited the pound\u2019s post-referendum slump to go on luxury shopping sprees. The weaker pound, which fell to a 31-year low against the dollar of $1.2796 after the Brexit vote, brings mixed fortunes for Britons. It makes their foreign holidays and imported goods more expensive but boosts the competitiveness of UK exporters by making goods cheaper overseas. The pound had stabilised in recent weeks, albeit well below levels recorded before the EU referendum. But on Friday it was under pressure again and dropped below $1.30. This was blamed on worries that Brexit talks could begin within months, following comments by Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. Johnson said on Thursday that the UK government was likely to trigger Article 50 and begin the process of the country\u2019s formal departure from the EU early next year. The ONS has cautioned against reading too much into any one month\u2019s figures. In this latest release on tourism, it made no mention of the referendum\u2019s effects. The figures put the number of visits to the UK by overseas residents in July 2016 at 3.07m, a 1% rise from July 2015, using seasonally adjusted figures. UK residents made 5.79m visits abroad, also a 1% rise compared with July 2015. Many of the early economic indicators on the UK since the referendum have come in above economists\u2019 gloomy forecasts, with signs that consumer spending has held up well and the housing market has remained steady. Earlier this week the ONS said a check on the data released so far suggested that there had not been a huge shock to the economy.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group\u2019s pre-tax profit more than halved to \u00a317m in the first six months of 2016 due to restructuring costs and price cuts, but the company insisted that its three-year turnaround plan was on track. Pre-tax profit at the UK\u2019s largest co-operative business in the six months to 2 July was down 53% from \u00a336m in the same period last year. Profits were reduced by the cost of a facelift of its business, management restructure, pay rises for shop workers and price cuts at its supermarkets. The latter cost the Co-op \u00a330m in the first half. As part of a \u00a31.3bn investment to regain customers\u2019 trust following a series of scandals in 2013 and 2014, the 172-year-old group has rebranded its stores, replacing the green facades with the mutual\u2019s traditional blue cloverleaf-like design. The Co-op said it had also written down the value of its investment in the Co-operative Bank by \u00a345m to \u00a3140m. The group is halfway through a three-year turnaround programme, after its bank came close to collapse in 2013, threatening the existence of the entire group. This was caused by losses from bad debts on commercial property opening up a \u00a31.5bn hole in its finances. Bondholders took control of the bank at the time, turning the Co-op Group into a minority shareholder. Its financial woes were compounded by revelations that the bank\u2019s former chairman, Paul Flowers, took class A drugs. This led to thousands of customers leaving the scandal-hit firm. A month ago, the Co-op bank revealed a first-half loss of \u00a3177m, down from \u00a3204m, but warned that the economic fallout from the Brexit vote was a threat to its recovery plans. The bank said the uncertain economic backdrop was depleting its capital reserves \u2013 a key cushion against financial instability. The Co-op group\u2019s half-year results showed overall revenues increased 2.2% to \u00a34.7bn in the 26 weeks to 2 July, with customer transactions up 3.3%. Like-for-like food sales rose 3.1%, marking three consecutive years of growth. The grocer has been forced to slash prices to match rivals, and also relaunched its own-brand products. This appears to have paid off: it said its convenient stores grew faster than the market, with sales up 4.3%. But the business took a hit from higher staff wage bills. It has awarded an 8.5% pay rise to 60,000 shop-floor workers and their supervisors over the next two years. More than 5 million Co-op customers start receiving their new membership cards on Friday, which will give them 5% cashback every time they buy a Co-op-branded product or service. An additional 1% will go to charity. Members spending \u00a320 a week on own-brand groceries will earn \u00a352 in rewards and give \u00a310.40 to charities a year. Zoe Mills, analyst at consultancy Verdict Retail, said: \u201cThe Co-op has a lot to be happy about, as despite the tricky food market, it has increased like-for-like sales, notably at its convenience stores, a relative success given the hardship that other grocers have faced. \u201cLooking ahead, Co-op still faces stiff competition from the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury\u2019s for convenience market share. However, with these grocers also occupied with turning around their bigger stores, Co-op\u2019s smaller store format, and convenience-led strategy, means it has less worries in this regard.\u201d As well as groceries, the Co-op sells pre-paid funeral plans, which have seen strong growth. But due to a falling death rate, profits at its funeral parlours fell to \u00a342m from \u00a347m. Richard Pennycook, the chief executive, said: \u201cWe are only halfway through the Rebuild [programme] and much remains to be done, whether it is investing in our digital capability or campaigning on key issues. We remain firmly on track with our plans and are encouraged that the work we are doing is attracting more and more people back to the Co-op.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The founder of Sports Direct, Mike Ashley, is taking over as chief executive of the troubled sports retailer, after the resignation of Dave Forsey. The surprise move for Ashley to take a more hands-on role came after he admitted in a rare TV interview this week that he had taken his \u201ceye off the ball\u201d, before adding: \u201cI\u2019m going to fix it and I will.\u201d Forsey\u2019s departure comes after months of mounting criticism of Sports Direct\u2019s working practices and corporate governance by shareholders, unions and politicians, following a Guardian investigation that exposed a climate of fear at its warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire. MPs later likened it to a Victorian workhouse. Ashley, a majority owner of Sports Direct, which he founded in 1982, said of the departure of his long-serving righthand man, Forsey: \u201cI feel like I have lost my right arm, but I do hope to have the opportunity to work with Dave again in the future.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s share price, which has taken a battering over the past 12 months during which time the company fell out of the FTSE 100, were up nearly 5% on Friday morning following the announcement of Forsey\u2019s departure, to about 300p. Twelve months ago they were changing hands at 748p. Forsey started working for Ashley as a teenager three decades ago. In June, after months of criticism of the company, Forsey gave up a share award worth \u00a33.7m he was due to receive next year. He has been paid a salary of \u00a3150,000 but no annual bonus. \u201cI have given my entire working life to the company and in return the company has given me amazing opportunities and experiences,\u201d Forsey said in a statement. \u201cI wish everyone at Sports Direct well in the future.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s chairman, Keith Hellawell, who has also been under fire, thanked Forsey for his \u201csignificant contribution over the last 32 years and during a period of significant growth and change at the company\u201d. The company also announced that Karen Byers, its head of retail, had been promoted to global head of operations and Sean Nevitt, head of buying, had been elevated to global head of commercial. Byers, a multimillionaire, has been described as a tough \u201cworkaholic\u201d and as \u201cthe person who sets the rules\u201d. She has had a crucial role in the Sports Direct growth story since joining the firm 24 years ago as a shop manager. She caught Ashley\u2019s eye when she sold him a pair of jeans in a store he was buying. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: \u201cPoor old Dave Forsey may have fallen on his sword, but he did act as a human shield to Mike Ashley and it is not clear how somebody who admitted to MPs a few months ago that the Sports Direct business was getting too big for him will get on with now being the real CEO.\u201d This week, Sports Direct bowed to shareholder pressure by agreeing to an independent review of its working practices and corporate governance. Ashley said he had not known about the poor treatment of employees but claimed there was little wrong at Sports Direct, telling BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that problems at the company\u2019s warehouse were caused by \u201cthe odd rotten apple\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is odd, isolated instances. It\u2019s the odd rotten apple in the barrel and then you say: \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to go and find the rotten apple in the barrel\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m now coming in to work very closely with HR, the warehouse and the [employment] agencies.\u201d The sportswear tycoon announced plans earlier in September to put an employee on the company\u2019s board to show its willingness to listen to staff, after its reputation was battered by the Guardian\u2019s revelations and a campaign by the Unite union. Joshua Raymond, a market analyst at XTB.com, was surprised that Forsey\u2019s departure had not been announced at Sports Direct\u2019s recent annual general meeting. \u201cHe seemed to have come through the crisis over the firm\u2019s working conditions with a vigour to rectify the problems despite huge pressure from the media and large shareholders. \u201cNevertheless whilst the change would have long been mooted by shareholders, the fact Mike Ashley immediately assumes the CEO role will keep a laser focused attention on the firm\u2019s ability to recover from the crisis. This point is even more pertinent given much of the concern focused on Ashley\u2019s power grip on all aspects of the retailer, a grip which has just become even stronger.\u201d The company has also come under growing pressure from large City investors to make changes. More than half of independent shareholders (57%) failed to support Hellawell at the AGM, but Ashley insisted he was staying in the chairman role for at least another year to help him fix the problems. The law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain (RPC), which has long worked with Ashley and Sports Direct, carried out a preliminary review published this month and had been tasked with a further investigation. However, after shareholders called for an independent review at the retailer\u2019s annual meeting, the company said it would ask someone else to conduct it. RPC\u2019s report, published the day before the AGM, criticised the company and prompted Ashley to apologise to staff for practices that were \u201cpotentially oppressive\u201d at its warehouse. Paul Lee, head of corporate governance at Aberdeen Asset Management, said Ashley\u2019s move into the top job should be only temporary while the retailer finds a new boss from outsiode the organidsation: \u201cMy perception and my hope is that Ashley taking over is an interim measure while they go out and seek a new, strong candidate to take on the CEO role. We voted against Dave Forsey because we were very clear that the management team as it stood wasn\u2019t capable of running the business. Ashley himself has said so. \u201cThere may be an internal candidate but we think an external appointment is needed. Ashley is the heart of the business and we should be ensuring he is surrounded by the right team to build on the success they have had over the last several years, someone who is capable of managing a company of Sports Direct\u2019s size and scale.\u201d Producing in-depth, thoughtful, well-reported journalism is difficult and expensive - but supporting us isn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "BP is proposing to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight using plans that fall a long way short of industry best practice and would not be allowed in some other regions, according to an expert in oil spill disasters. Andrew Hopkins, emeritus professor at the Australian National University, has researched BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Writing in the Conversation he said it was \u201cby no means obvious\u201d that BP had reduced risks of a spill in the Bight to as low as reasonably practicable, which is the requirement under Australian law. BP has proposed to drill for oil inside a commonwealth marine reserve in the Great Australian Bight. Its first two environmental plans were rejected, after the regulator found they did not meet its requirements. Its third plan is expected to be resolved next week. Hopkins compared the limited information BP had made available about its plans to drill in the Bight with what would be required to drill in other regions, and with practices committed to in other regions. In Hopkins view BP\u2019s plans probably would not be acceptable if it was planning to drill for oil in the Arctic. If BP\u2019s well in the Bight blew out, as the one in the Gulf of Mexico did, the company would first try to cap it. But, if that failed, it would drill a \u201crelief well\u201d, which would intersect with the one spilling oil. It would then be filled with concrete to block the spill. BP\u2019s oil spill modelling says its \u201crealistic and achievable time to drill a relief well is 149 days\u201d. Earlier estimates from the company suggested it would take 157 days. But new US regulations for drilling in the Arctic require a relief well to be drilled and completed within 45 days. To achieve that, the company must have access to a nearby rig. BP has not said it will have its own rig nearby in the Bight. Instead, it would borrow one from another company. But it is unclear where such a rig would come from, since there are no other rigs in the Bight. Hopkins told the Guardian it also wasn\u2019t clear how quickly another company could release a rig for this purpose. \u201cThe Gulf of Mexico blowout was stopped in 87 days, during which time it inflicted damage worth at least $40bn. Who knows what the toll would have been if it had lasted almost twice as long?\u201d Before drilling a relief well, BP would try to cap the blowout using a a \u201ccapping stack\u201d, a new piece of equipment designed after the Gulf of Mexico disaster. BP has previously said it would rely on shipping a stack from Singapore to the Bight, which would take 32 days. Including shipping time, it said capping would take 35 days \u2013 an estimate government officials have said was \u201coptimistic\u201d. Five capping stacks are available for rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and are expected to be on site within 48 hours. In the Arctic, a capping stack must be at the site within 24 hours. \u201cIf the Arctic justifies this level of protection, why not the Bight?\u201d Hopkins said. A recent exercise in the Gulf of Mexico showed that a nearby capping stack could be used to cap a spill in just 15 days, he said. \u201cIn this respect BP\u2019s estimate of the time it would take to cap a blowout is a long way short of industry best practice.\u201d Hopkins said that even BP\u2019s plans to use subsea oil dispersants would not necessarily be deployed before oil reached a shoreline. BP has said subsea dispersal would begin within 10 days \u201cwhere that is possible\u201d but oil could reach the coast within 9.2 days. \u201cIts published oil spill response plan gives no guarantee that an oil spill in the Bight would not reach the shoreline and damage the environment,\u201d Hopkins said. A spokeswoman for BP said: \u201cIn the very unlikely event that there was a well incident, we would take action immediately, starting from within seconds. There are lots of parallel activities that we would mobilise, such as starting dispersant injection or surface recovery, at the same time as capping the well. \u201cWe believe that the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema) is a technically credible, strong and independent regulator overseeing a world-class regulatory system. The \u2018objectives-based system\u2019 used by Nopsema requires companies including BP to identify and appropriately manage risk; this system ensures each activity is assessed based on its circumstances, instead of the one-size-fits-all approach taken in some other countries.\u201d",
