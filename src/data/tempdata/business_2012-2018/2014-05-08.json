    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi has dropped his broadest hint yet of imminent moves to head off deflation when he said policy makers at the bank were \"comfortable\" about action in early June. Upward pressure on the euro eased and yields on government bonds fell after the ECB president expressed concern that weak growth and the possible knock-on effects from the Ukraine could derail the eurozone's fragile recovery. Although Draghi announced no change in policy following the meeting of the ECB's general council in Brussels, he signalled that a move could come once his in-house economists produce updated forecasts for inflation in the first few days of next month. \"I would say that the governing council is comfortable with acting next time but before we want to see the staff projections that will come out in early June,\" Draghi told a press conference. \"There is consensus about being dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation. So there is a consensus with not being resigned to expecting this,\" he said. \"We have a consensus about action, but after seeing the staff projections in early June.\" Inflation across the 18-nation eurozone currently stands at 0.7% but the financial markets expect it to fall closer to zero when the flash estimates of the May cost of living are published on June 3. The ECB council meets two days later and while some analysts said Draghi had left himself some room for manoeuvre, most believe action from the ECB to counter deflationary pressures is all but inevitable. \"The recovery is proceeding but it is proceeding at a slow pace, and it still remains fairly modest, and there are some downward risks now,\" Draghi said. \"The risks have to do with the possible weakening of global demand, have to do with geopolitical risks that are of serious significance, and have to do with \u2026 the exchange rate.\" On the foreign exchanges, the euro moved close to $1.40 when the ECB said it was taking no immediate action. But it later dropped by more than a cent after Draghi's remarks at his press conference. The prospect of cuts in interest rates, possibly backed by the start of a eurozone quantitative easing programme also bore down on bond yields. In Germany, the interest rate on the 10-year bund dropped to 1.45%, close to last week's 11-year low. City economists expressed doubts about whether ECB action would be enough to see off the threat from deflation. Dario Perkins, of Lombard Street Research, said the ECB seemed likely to offer a token rate cut in June, but remained some distance from more aggressive easing. \"The ECB is hoping continued economic recovery will ease deflation fears, meaning QE isn't required. But the threat of deflation remains significant, even for some 'core' countries. With the ECB reluctant to properly insure against this prospect, a negative growth surprise is needed before we could see euro-area QE.\" Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist, at Capital Economics, said: \"The ECB signalled very strongly at today's press conference that policy will be loosened next month. A small cut in the main refinancing rate seems like the least that the Bank could do and is unlikely to be particularly effective. Bolder policy action, perhaps including asset purchases, should not be far off.\"",

      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered has pledged to rethink how it pays its bosses after the bank suffered a damaging shareholder rebellion at its annual general meeting. At the meeting in London 41% of shareholder votes opposed the pay policy for the next three years \u2013 a revolt that came close to legally forcing the bank to scrap its pay plans. The bank also faced hostile questions from individual shareholders unhappy about pay and other issues after a gruelling 2013 for the bank. Based in London but operating in emerging markets, Standard Chartered suffered its first fall in annual profits for more than a decade last year. Its reputation as the star of Britain's battered banking sector was dealt a heavy blow when it was forced to pay \u00a3415m in fines over violations of US sanctions against Iran. Chairman Sir John Peace told the meeting in advance of the vote that the bank had been in talks with investors and would continue discussions to make changes. He said new rules on executive pay, including the European Union's bonus cap, had made devising the policy difficult. Though the bank technically won the vote, big investors expect companies to take note of large votes against pay and other governance issues. After the vote was announced, a spokesman for the bank said: \"Although we are pleased that all the votes on Standard Chartered's executive remuneration have been passed, we are clearly concerned that a significant minority of shareholders voted against the bank's new remuneration policy. \"We acknowledge their views, will reflect on them, and continue our dialogue with our shareholders and the governance bodies in order to address them properly.\" Large investor advisory groups had called for votes against the pay policy because bonuses were heavily linked to targets that could be hit in a single year. Investors and regulators want banks to pay top managers over a longer time to discourage short-term risky behaviour. Peace said the board had a difficult balancing act because it also had to comply with the EU rule limiting bonuses to 100% of salary, or 200% with shareholder approval. Mike Porter, a small shareholder, criticised the lack of performance targets and said executive directors had earned large sums while shareholders had suffered in the last few years. \"I do not see how shareholders have performed well when directors have had much more substantial pay rises. I think it is quite wrong.\" Peace replied: \"We certainly have not approached remuneration on the basis of enriching the bank or individuals. We have found this year's remuneration process very complex.\" Another shareholder complained about rising bad debts and a \"flaccid\" dividend which he said indicated the board's lack of confidence. Peace said he was sorry if the shareholder was unhappy about the dividend but that the board was confident about the bank's long-term prospects in growth markets. \"I tell institutional shareholders it is the best bank in the world,\" Peace said. In a trading update, the bank said market conditions were difficult and that income and profit fell in the first quarter of the year. Company pay is in the spotlight at this year's annual meeting season \u2013 the first since business secretary Vince Cable required companies to give shareholders the binding vote on future pay policy as well as an advisory vote on the report for last year. Household goods maker Reckitt Benckiser and online grocer Ocado both suffered revolts at their AGMs on Wednesday.",

The private-equity owned group said it expects its initial public offering of shares to be priced at between 185p and 245p each, implying a maximum market capitalisation of \u00a32.5bn. Saga, which has grown from its origins as a travel company in the seaside town of Folkestone to a major insurance player, said last week that it planned to raise \u00a3550m by floating a quarter of the business, using the proceeds to pay down debt. The float could also mean big payouts for 6,000 staff at Saga and its sister company the AA, who own about 13% of the business. Anyone wanting to invest can apply for shares on the company's website before the deadline of 20 May, with the shares due to being trading from May 29. The minimum investment is \u00a31,000. The overwhelming response to the Royal Mail float, where shares earmarked for small private investors were oversubscribed seven times, suggests there could be a rush to buy Saga stock. The company has said it will give priority to staff and customers, who will also get a free share for every 20 they buy in the float and hold for a year. \"Today's announcement reflects the strong level of investor interest shown in acquiring Saga shares, which we believe underlines the potential that exists in the company,\" said chairman Andrew Goodsell, who led the \u00a31.3bn buyout of Saga nearly a decade ago. Saga has canvassed its 2.5 million customers and found 700,000 would be interested in buying shares in the company. Charterhouse Capital Partners, CVC and Permira, which have owned Saga's parent firm since 2007, will sell stakes in the IPO.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Centrica, the owner of British Gas, was forced to issue its third profit warning in five months on Thursday, after admitting it had lost an average of 2,200 customers a day since the start of the year. The announcement sets the scene for a stormy annual meeting on Monday, when shareholders could combine with fuel poverty campaigners to express concerns about the group's strategy. Centrica's share price fell 2% as it predicted that 2014 earnings would miss expectations. That decline, together with the expected departure of chief executive Sam Laidlaw, prompted one City analyst to describe the business as \"rudderless\". The UK's largest energy supplier vowed to do all it could to hold gas and electricity prices at current levels for the rest of this year \u2013 a response to its rival SSE, which has promised to hold its prices until 2016. It also said it planned to sell off \u00a3500m worth of UK power plants, almost half of its generating capacity, and \u00a3100m of assets in Canada. It intends to plough some of the money into upgrading old power stations, but analysts think it likely also to use cash to buy back its shares. Laidlaw said these actions taken across the group would leave the business well placed for the long term, scaling back profit expectations by 10%. \"While earnings are anticipated to fall in 2014, we expect an improvement in 2015, assuming more normal weather conditions and reflecting the prospects for underlying growth in Direct Energy, UK gas storage, British Gas Services and British Gas Business,\" he added. Centrica said there had been a 25% reduction in gas use during the first four months of the year and 10% in electricity use, because of a warm winter. However, the firm also admitted in an interim management statement, brought forward from the annual meeting, that it had lost 180,000 supply customers since 1 January and an additional 100,000 from the services side, which provides boiler maintenance. Centrica claims that small, independent energy companies are winning customers because they do not have the social and environmental obligations imposed on the big six utilities. It has been at the forefront of grim warnings that the lights will go out unless politicians stop meddling in the market place and there are better opportunities to invest in new plant. It was particularly angered at Labour saying it would freeze power prices and force companies to split their power generating and supply businesses, if elected in 2015. Centrica on Thursday said it would try to hold prices this year while selling off Langage, Killingholme and Humber gas-fired power stations, which have a combined capacity of 2.7GW. Nick Luff, the finance director who plans to leave this summer, said this would not undermine the country's energy security because the group expected the facilities to be bought by independent companies. Laidlaw has also said he plans to leave Centrica but, in an analyst call on Thursday, declined again to give a time scale, saying he would only comment when something concrete was decided. There are now rumblings in the City that such top-level management uncertainty at a difficult time is beginning to create problems. One analyst from Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in an equity research note: \"The [chief executive officer's] vague comment on rampant press speculation concerning his departure is \u2026 potentially leaving a complicated vessel rudderless in increasingly stormy waters.\" But other analysts at Deutsche Bank took comfort from the fact that Centrica reaffirmed a commitment to real dividend growth. JP Morgan argued that the pressure on earnings was already well-known and added that : \"the message on (holding prices in) retail should be helpful politically.\" The situation facing Centrica, SEE and other large utilities has become more fraught since Ofgem and the Competition and Markets Authority expressed deep concern about past profit levels and the continuing domination of both power and supply markets by the vertically integrated companies. A full investigation is expected to be announced by the CMA next month.",

We've got the AGM next week and I look forward to us having a good debate and moving forward.\" Reid and fellow independent co-operatives have a crucial role in determining whether Myners' reforms are voted through next Saturday because they own 22% of the group, with representatives of the Co-op Group's 8 million members controlling the rest. Myners said it was \"astonishing\" that Reid was still on the group's board after sitting on the Co-op Bank's audit committee for three years while a \u00a31.5bn hole built up in its finances. Losses at the bank, now only 30% owned by the group, are viewed by Myners as an indictment of how its parent was run. Reid said: \"I'm not the only one that has been on the board in that time. There are all sorts of implications of what Paul is saying. Why he would target me I don't know.\" Reid is chief executive of the Midcounties co-operative, Britain's biggest customer-owned retailer outside the sprawling Co-op Group. The voting power of the independent co-operatives gives Reid and four other chief executives seats on the group board, which also includes a public sector worker, a nurse and a retired publisher. Under Myners' proposals, a board comprised of Reid, his fellow independent society bosses and 15 member representatives would be replaced by a board of businessmen, with a separate membership council to oversee the new boardroom and ensure co-operative values are maintained. Reid has defended the cooperative business model against Myners' attacks, with the former City minister saying that chaotic governance allowed billions of pounds to be wasted and left the group \u00a31.4bn in debt. Reid has said he is open to change and has denied threatening to block Myners' proposals in advance of their publication. \"It's a tragic way to handle what should have been quite a positive thing for the whole of the movement. I don't know why Paul has chosen to make this adversarial whereas the nature of the [co-operative] beast is to want to discuss things, be collaborative and debate.\" Myners was called in to report on the group's governance as an independent director in December. Since then, Euan Sutherland quit as chief executive in March after 10 months in the job. Sutherland branded the group \"ungovernable\" when details of his \u00a33.6m annual pay deal were leaked to the Observer. After rushing out his preliminary findings in the wake of Sutherland's departure, Myners, the former chairman of Guardian Media Group, published his full report on Wednesday. He attacked the group's \"labyrinthine\" structure and said directors were \"in denial\" about what they had let happen to the 170-year-old business, which spans grocery stores, funeral parlours and pharmacies. Myners' attacks on the board have prompted warnings that he had alienated representatives who will vote on his plan at the group's AGM in Manchester on 17 May. Many co-operative activists view his proposals as an attempt to overturn the group's traditions and turn it into a centralised Plc-style operation.",

      "bodyText": "Barclays is cutting 19,000 jobs in a radical overhaul of its business, including a dramatic scaling back of its investment bank that the chief executive said would avoid a rerun of last year's rows over bonuses. Antony Jenkins said there would be no repeat of his decision to increase bonuses by 10% when profits had fallen sharply, as he set out his strategy to partly unravel the work of his predecessor Bob Diamond who had aimed to run a major investment bank. \"What I did last year was a one time initiative ... I do not expect to repeat that\", said Jenkins, who had faced criticism for defending the bonus rises as necessary to avoid a \"death spiral\" of top bankers leaving. Jenkins would not say how many fewer staff would receive \u00a31m \u2013 after 481 received more than that last year \u2013 as a result of the scaling back of the investment banking arm. Until recently known as Barclays Capital, the arm was built up by Diamond before he quit following the 2012 Libor rigging scandal. More than half of the 19,000 job cuts will fall in the UK and Jenkins said the coming months would be \"challenging for colleagues\" as the jobs were shed and a separate division \u2013 dubbed a \"bad bank\" \u2013 created to hold unwanted parts of the investment bank and operations in continental Europe together worth \u00a3115bn. The shares were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100 jumping almost 8% despite concerns from analysts that the bank would lose revenue as a result of the cuts in its investment banking division, traditionally the group's powerhouse that generates more than 50% of the profits. The investment bank is to lose 7,000 jobs from a workforce of about 24,000 as it shifts away from its traditional area of expertise in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and move towards advising customers and equities. The 19,000 jobs going over the next three years include 12,000 cuts announced in February that were earmarked for this year. This year's total is now being raised to 14,000 as 2,000 jobs will go in the investment bank. That leaves 5,000 investment bankers facing redundancy by 2016. At least 4,000 of the 19,000 jobs have already gone. Jenkins described the newly merged retail and corporate bank as the new \"powerhouse\" for Barclays, to shift the focus from the investment bank. Higher bonuses had been paid last year to those Barclays wanted to keep, Jenkins said, referring to a \"bench\" of top staff to run the shrunken investment bank. \"The bench is protected \u2026 It is secure, it's deep and talented.\" A number of investment bankers have left, including the American Skip McGee who joined when Barclays bought the Wall Street operations of Lehman Brothers after it went bankrupt in 2008. Jenkins said this was \"generational change\". Regulatory demands that the bank hold more capital and a structural change in the FICC operations, were cited by Barclays for the changes to the investment bank. Jenkins said he intended to reduce the proportion of the bank's assets used for investment banking from 50% to 30% by 2016. While much of the focus was on the investment bank, unions expressed concerned about the impact on the high street bank, where there are expectations that Barclays will close more branches as technological advances reduce the need for staff. \"The bank needs to recognise their tireless work to put customers first while jobs have been lost, and give reassurances over their futures,\" said Dominic Hook, a Unite national officer. The \"bad bank\", which will include the high street operations in continental Europe which employ almost 6,000, was described by Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, as \"presentational nonsense\". Sandy Chen, an analyst at Cenkos, said he was concerned about the \"uncertainties involved with the next two to three years of hacking back the brambles\u2026 and the income-generating capacity of the severely pruned investment bank that will emerge\". Jenkins \u2013 who has set himself the target of making Barclays the \"go to\" bank \u2013 said the cuts would cost another \u00a3800m on top of the existing \u00a32.7bn already announced to turn around the group. Jenkins said the whole global banking arena was changing because of regulatory moves and he was embarking on a \"bold simplification of Barclays\". \"We will be a focused international bank, operating only in areas where we have capability, scale and competitive advantage,\" he said. With the last British bank with ambitions to be a global investment bank stepping back, chancellor George Osborne told the BBC the job cuts were \"regrettable\". \"Part of our long-term economic plan is having British banks that aren't bailed out by the taxpayer, but instead support the British economy, lend to small businesses, and lend to families,\" Osborne said.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Lord Sainsbury calls for government to stop Pfizer buying AstraZeneca", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Former science minister Lord Sainsbury has launched a blistering attack on Pfizer's \u00a363bn takeover move on AstraZeneca, calling on the government to block its attempt to \"dismember\" a strategically important British company. Amid expectation that the US pharmaceutical firm is preparing to come back with an improved offer which could value AstraZeneca at \u00a367bn, Sainsbury warned David Cameron he would be politically damaged if he simply stood by and let the takeover go ahead. \"I am not in favour of the takeover of excellent and strategically important British companies by failing foreign companies whose actions are fuelled by tax avoidance, and who want to asset-strip the intellectual property of the British company and then dismember it,\" said Sainsbury, writing in the Guardian. Pfizer's Scottish boss Ian Read has indicated that a deal with Britain's second biggest drugs firm would allow it to save on American corporate taxes, and that AstraZeneca would be broken up and its assets put into Pfizer's three divisions, one or more of which could be sold off. \"This would involve the closure of many of [AstraZeneca's] operations, a substantial reduction of its R&amp;D [research and development], and would be a devastating blow to the UK presence in the pharmaceutical industry,\" warned Sainsbury, a scion of the supermarket dynasty and chancellor of Cambridge university. His intervention came a day after Astra's former boss Sir David Barnes branded Pfizer a \"praying mantis\" that \"sucks the lifeblood out of their prey\". Michael Arthur, provost of University College London and a member of the UK's Medical Research Council,and professor David Nutt, the government's former drug advisor who now runs neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, also voiced their concerns over the impact of a Pfizer takeover on UK science research. The American company has pledged to keep at least 20% of the combined company's R&amp;D workforce in the UK for at least five years but the prime minister demanded more security on UK jobs, investment and science this week, with deputy prime minister Nick Clegg yesterday insisting the government was \"focused\" on getting \"binding\" commitments from the US firm. However the American drugmaker is unlikely to give any further assurances until AstraZeneca opens its books. But Sainsbury attacked government attempts to secure further pledges as a \"total waste of time\" given Pfizer's record of breaking promises in past takeovers. Any commitment that was not legally binding was a \"waste of paper\" he said, adding that Pfizer boss Ian Read had made clear he would not sign any legal document. The billionaire and philanthropist added: \"If he [the prime minister] lets AstraZeneca fall into the hands of Pfizer, many people will not forgive him \u2013 and will use the ballot box to make their feelings known.\" AstraZeneca employs 6,700 staff in the UK with an R&amp;D budget in the country of \u00a32.8bn . The UK workforce is part of 51,000 worldwide and Sweden's minister for enterprise, Annie Loof, has also expressed worries about job cuts in Sweden, where AstraZeneca employs 5,900. She has written to both companies to express her concerns. But AstraZeneca shares rose more than 2% on Thursday \u2013 having fallen earlier in the week as opposition from some politicians and the scientific community mounted against the deal. The shares are still below the \u00a350-a-share proposal in cash and shares from Pfizer last Friday. However, the value of that approach \u2013 which was immediately rejected by Britain's second-largest drugmaker \u2013 has since slipped, to about \u00a348, because Pfizer's share price has dropped following poor results on Monday. Pfizer has until 26 May to table a firm offer or walk away for six months under UK takeover rules. Read, who earlier this week reported sharply falling sales at Pfizer, has been summoned to appear in front of two parliamentary committees next Tuesday and Wednesday. His AstraZeneca counterpart Pascal Soriot wiill also answer the MPs' questions, immediately after Read. Soriot and his management team have embarked on a roadshow to get feedback from investors. They have already won the backing of the firm's fourth-largest shareholder, Investor AB which is controlled by the Swedish Wallenberg family and holds a 4.1% stake, as well as Aberdeen Asset Management with 2.4%. Veteran healthcare investor Neil Woodford has also expressed his trust in AstraZeneca. Some shareholders, however, want AstraZeneca to engage with Pfizer. The Anglo-Swedish company fought back by highlighting the potential of its drug pipeline this week, which is expected to boost sales by three quarters over the next decade. It advanced the most promising of its new immuno-oncology drugs, MEDI4736 for lung cancer, to late-stage clinical trials on Thursday. David Sainsbury p34",

Michael Arthur, provost of University College London and a member of the UK's Medical Research Council,and professor David Nutt, the government's former drug advisor who now runs neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College, also voiced their concerns over the impact of a Pfizer takeover on UK science research.</p> <p>The American company has pledged to keep at least 20% of the combined company's R&amp;D workforce in the UK for at least five years but the prime minister demanded more security on UK jobs, investment and science this week, with deputy prime minister Nick Clegg yesterday insisting the government was \"focused\" on getting \"binding\" commitments from the US firm. However the American drugmaker is unlikely to give any further assurances until AstraZeneca opens its books.</p> <p>But Sainsbury attacked government attempts to secure further pledges as a \"total waste of time\" given Pfizer's record of breaking promises in past takeovers. Any commitment that was not legally binding was a \"waste of paper\" he said, adding that Pfizer boss Ian Read had made clear he would not sign any legal document.</p> <p>The billionaire and philanthropist added:</p> <p>\"If he [the prime minister] lets AstraZeneca fall into the hands of Pfizer, many people will not forgive him \u2013 and will use the ballot box to make their feelings known.\"</p> <p>AstraZeneca employs 6,700 staff in the UK with an R&amp;D budget in the country of \u00a32.8bn .</p> <p>The UK workforce is part of 51,000 worldwide and Sweden's minister for enterprise, Annie Loof, has also expressed worries about job cuts in Sweden, where AstraZeneca employs 5,900. She has written to both companies to express her concerns.</p> <p>But AstraZeneca shares rose more than 2% on Thursday \u2013 having fallen earlier in the week as opposition from some politicians and the scientific community mounted against the deal. The shares are still below the \u00a350-a-share proposal in cash and shares from Pfizer last Friday. However, the value of that approach \u2013 which was immediately rejected by Britain's second-largest drugmaker \u2013 has since slipped, to about \u00a348, because Pfizer's share price has dropped following poor results on Monday. Pfizer has until 26 May to table a firm offer or walk away for six months under UK takeover rules.</p> <p>Read, who earlier this week reported sharply falling sales at Pfizer, has been summoned to appear in front of two parliamentary committees next Tuesday and Wednesday. His AstraZeneca counterpart Pascal Soriot wiill also answer the MPs' questions, immediately after Read.</p> <p>Soriot and his management team have embarked on a roadshow to get feedback from investors. They have already won the backing of the firm's fourth-largest shareholder, Investor AB which is controlled by the Swedish Wallenberg family and holds a 4.1% stake, as well as Aberdeen Asset Management with 2.4%. Veteran healthcare investor Neil Woodford has also expressed his trust in AstraZeneca. Some shareholders, however, want AstraZeneca to engage with Pfizer.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/06/astrazeneca-large-shareholder-pfizer-takeover-public-interest\" title=\"\">The Anglo-Swedish company fought back by highlighting the potential of its drug pipeline</a> this week, which is expected to boost sales by three quarters over the next decade.

      "bodyText": "The former BP boss Tony Hayward has returned to the top ranks of the corporate world following his appointment as full-time chairman of Glencore Xstrata, the FTSE 100 commodity trading and mining group. Hayward, who left the oil firm in disgrace following the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, had served as acting chairman of Glencore over the past year, after the City veteran Sir John Bond was ousted from the board last May. However, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum has urged investors to vote against Hayward's appointment because of Glencore's exclusively male board. Peter Grauer, who chairs Glencore's nomination committee, said: \"Over the last 12 months, Tony has provided exemplary leadership of the board and proved himself to be the outstanding candidate to take on the role permanently. We continue to look forward to harnessing his in-depth knowledge of the resources industry and of listed company governance to underpin the mandate given to him as chairman to lead the board in helping to deliver long-term, sustainable returns for shareholders.\" The appointment marks an extraordinary rehabilitation for Hayward, who was forced out of BP in July 2010 after the Gulf of Mexico disaster \u2013 the biggest marine oil spill in history. He was vilified across America after he said \"I want my life back\" in the aftermath of the explosion that killed 11 people and devastated the livelihoods of many others. Hayward, who had spent his entire career at BP, was quick to move on and helped launch an investment vehicle called Vallares to tap into Kurdistan's oil riches. Together with his business partner Nat Rothschild he bought Turkish-based oil firm Genel Energy and merged it with Vallares. There are questions about whether he will retain his role as chief executive of Genel, with media reports suggesting he could leave within a year. Hayward began his comeback in the FTSE 100 world by joining Glencore's board as an independent director in April 2011 ahead of the company's flotation. As permanent chairman, he could help broker deals in the oil sector. Investec analyst Marc Elliott said: \"Oil seems to be a growing arm of the Glencore business and if they want to push and expand a bit more Tony's expertise can certainly help with that.\"",

With some positive company updates and signs of the tensions easing in Ukraine, investors were in fairly upbeat mood. The Pan-European FTSEEurofirst 300 closed more than 1% ahead, close to a six year high.

Having climbed to a two and a half year high of $1.3992 against the dollar, it is now at $1.3864 as investors bet that Draghi would back up his words by either cutting rates or unveiling some other stimulus measures in June.</p> <p><i>On that note it's time to close up for the evening.

One might even suggest that there as an ostensible drift back to the old days of Trichet style communication today with the phrase \"the governing council is comfortable with acting next time but before we want to see the staff projections that will come out in early June\", which looks like \"strong vigilance\" and \"we are never pre-committed\", though the contingency on the staff forecasts is rather more heavily emphasized in this instance.</p> <p>On the other hand, it is now nigh on impossible for the ECB not to act in June, having stated that \"there is consensus about being dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation. So there is a consensus with not being resigned to expecting this ... We have a consensus about action, but after seeing the staff projections in early June.\" The slip in the euro versus the dollar certainly reflects this.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, the markets could expect to see 10-15 bps cut in the ECB's headline refinancing rate (to 0.1%-0.15%), and in the deposit rate it pays on banks deposits (to between -0.1% and -0.15%).

Numbers are improving week in week out and we\u2019re seeing signs of improved competitiveness in the periphery. But let\u2019s not forget there are still deep rooted underlying problems. Inflation remains disturbingly low and there are mumblings that economic recovery could falter if euro strength is sustained. What\u2019s more, the general state of the emerging markets has meant a slowdown in these economies has kept a lid on global trade and continued to put downward pressure on tradable goods prices. Ukraine remains a lurking concern. If these issues become worse, Draghi may find himself with little choice but to step in and to bring Europe back to health. Further rate reductions may be the first step but the most likely remedy would be buying of assets through quantitative easing-European style.</p> <p>So far Draghi has done a sound job of talking the talk, and often talking is almost as good as doing it. But investors are starting to look for actual movement - \u2018Will he, won\u2019t he\u2019 has kept many on their toes for several months already. In part because Europe is seen to be recovering in spite of these underlying issues. So far, Draghi hasn\u2019t needed to make a move. However, his positioning in Europe creates an air of uncertainty, adding to the clouds of unease already hovering over many part of the globe. Murky markets in the UK, US and Asia have meant many investors are fairly muted in their risk. By the end of the year we expect the clouds to have cleared for Europe, and quite possibly the UK too, but until then all eyes will be on Draghi\u2019s next move, followed by the China, and then the BOJ. Waiting for policy makers is the new investment normal in a post financial crisis world.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-536b757be4b0ece0827b0cd5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-08T12:16:01.595Z\">1.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CharltonEmma/statuses/464372802708324352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ECB&amp;src=hash\">#ECB</a> doing nothing gives the euro a little push higher -- will Draghi talk it back down? <a href=\"http://t.co/ZgP1G7nPa0\">pic.twitter.com/ZgP1G7nPa0</a></p>&mdash; Emma Charlton (@CharltonEmma) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CharltonEmma/statuses/464372802708324352\">May 8, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-536b7052e4b0e79669593193\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2014-05-08T11:57:45.104Z\">12.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-98a38b02-7131-4ecc-91f1-d82b3c668dd8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399550222504/28b43d1d-7fcd-4bbd-b9d1-23f527d0c4c9-460x279.png\" alt=\"Euro against the US dollar, May 08 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Euro against the US dollar, May 08 2014 Photograph: /Bloomberg</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><b>The Euro has hit a two-month high of $1.3690 against the US dollar</b>, following the ECB's decision not to change interest rates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/YanniKouts/statuses/464372568171237376\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Phew...

      "bodyText": "European markets have closed sharply higher following ECB president Mario Draghi suggested the central bank was ready to act in June to tackle the lowly inflation rate, writes Nick Fletcher. With some positive company updates and signs of the tensions easing in Ukraine, investors were in fairly upbeat mood. The Pan-European FTSEEurofirst 300 closed more than 1% ahead, close to a six year high. Elsewhere the closing scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 42.81 points or 0.63% higher at 6839.25 \u2022 Germany's Dax rose 0.9% to 9607.40 \u2022 France's Cac closed 1.37% to 4507.24 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB jumped 2.3% to 21,729.64 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended 1.7% higher at 10,591.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 94 points or 0.57%. Draghi's comments certainly succeeded in taking the froth out of the euro. Having climbed to a two and a half year high of $1.3992 against the dollar, it is now at $1.3864 as investors bet that Draghi would back up his words by either cutting rates or unveiling some other stimulus measures in June. On that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back again tomorrow. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons it's impossible for the European Central Bank to do NOTHING next month, after today's comments from Mario Draghi. Ostwald says: It has to be observed that Draghi &amp; Co's continued ability to tease markets with the promise of further policy easing measures, but not actually delivering, is impressive, but looks to have run its course. One might even suggest that there as an ostensible drift back to the old days of Trichet style communication today with the phrase \"the governing council is comfortable with acting next time but before we want to see the staff projections that will come out in early June\", which looks like \"strong vigilance\" and \"we are never pre-committed\", though the contingency on the staff forecasts is rather more heavily emphasized in this instance. On the other hand, it is now nigh on impossible for the ECB not to act in June, having stated that \"there is consensus about being dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation. So there is a consensus with not being resigned to expecting this ... We have a consensus about action, but after seeing the staff projections in early June.\" The slip in the euro versus the dollar certainly reflects this. So, the markets could expect to see 10-15 bps cut in the ECB's headline refinancing rate (to 0.1%-0.15%), and in the deposit rate it pays on banks deposits (to between -0.1% and -0.15%). The marginal lending rate, charged when banks borrow from the ECB, could fall by 25 basis points to 0.5%. Danae Kyriakopoulou of the Centre for Economics and Business Research says: So far, the ECB has been very generous with dovish promises to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d and take action when needed. All eyes will be on the updated economic outlook and decision next month to see whether these will eventually be translated into action. What did we learn from today's ECB press conference? \u2022 There's no-one quite like Mario Draghi for getting a market reaction without actually doing anything. The European Central Bank chief is in a class of his own for casually producing a rabbit from his hat - today's surprise was that the ECB is \"comfortable\" about taking action next month, having left rates unchanged today. As Draghi put it: I would say that the governing council is comfortable with acting next time but before we want to see the staff projections that will come out in early June... There is consensus about being dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation. So there is a consensus with not being resigned to expecting this ... We have a consensus about action, but after seeing the staff projections in early June. That was enough to wipe 1.5 cents off the euro - from the brink of $1.40 to just $1.385 at pixel time, on anticipation of an interest rate cut in June. \u2022 The Ukraine crisis is a big worry for central bankers. Draghi was clear -- the euro's strength is, in part, due to money flowing into the euro area because of fears over the Russian economy. Geopolitical risks would have more impact on the euro area than on other parts of the world. This includes the situation in Ukraine and the economic situation in Russia. \u2022 Europe remains fragile. The recent rally in peripheral bonds may show that the risk of default has receded, but it does not mean the recovery is secure. Draghi said: The recovery is proceeding but it is proceeding at a slow pace, and it still remains fairly modest, and there are some downward risks now. The risks have to do with the possible weakening of global demand, have to do with geopolitical risks that are of serious significance, and have to do with the exchange rate. \u2022 Draghi understands why people are sceptical about Europe, but he doesn't support them. He said he welcomed the debate, but insisted that Europe shouldn't \"renationalise\" its economies -- the answer is to move forwards with closer integration, not backwards. Will the voters agree at this month's elections? \u2022 The ECB has had quite enough of being told what to do. As Draghi put it: \"Over the last few day we received plenty of advice from political figures, from institutions on almost everything ... so we are certainly thankful for this advice... but you know by the treaty we are independent so people should be aware that if this might be seen as a threat to our independence it could cause long-term damage to our credibility.\" \"Certainly thankful\", indeed. Reminded me of Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho congratulating the referee on a \"fantastic\" performance after a recent defeat. He's now fighting a misconduct charge. Europe's stock markets have hit their highest level in almost six years, according to Reuters: EUROPE'S FTSEUROFIRST 300 HITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE JUNE 2008 AT 1,359.07 PTS - RTRS Jack Ewing of the New York Times sums it up: The press conference ended with Draghi repeating that Europe must push forwards, not go back. \"Our crisis would not have been so severe if we had more integration, not less integration\", Draghi insists. The future does not lie with \"the renationalisation of our economies\". And that was the end of the press conference - seven minutes early! What did Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup (euro area finance ministers) tell the ECB at the meeting? Draghi says that Dijsselbloem gave a presentation on the euro area that was rich and detailed, and \"to some extent positive\". Countries who have been in economic reform programmes have either left them (Ireland, soon to be followed by Portugal) or have made progress in them. It is encouraging that, after efforts that were so painful, for so long, are now producing some positive outcomes, Draghi adds. Juergen Baertz of Associated Press seeks more information about the ECB's fears over the Ukraine crisis - what effect is it having on the euro? Draghi says that it's a big issue for politicians, central bankers and policy makers - many national central banks who are most exposed to Ukraine and Russia have their own working groups on potential consequences. And the ECB chief agrees that the Ukraine crisis has been pushing the euro up. We have been observing for several months that M3 money supply* is being driven by money from outside...and that has the effect of keeping the euro strong * - the broadest measure of the money supply in an economy Draghi reminds the press pack of the mistake that led to the eurozone debt crisis -- the original fiscal rules were broken by Germany, France, Italy, which weakened those rules. Other countries then ran up debt levels that were unsustainable once market lost confidence in the euro area. Mario Draghi suggests that some Russian money could flow into the Cyprus banking sector due to the Ukraine crisis - if so, that would be a sign of renewed confidence in the island. The next question is on the rise of euroscepticism in Europe, ahead of the European elections later this month: Draghi replies that the debate taking place at this time is welcome - it's important that we he have a discussion about the benefits and costs about living in a monetary union. After all, this is a democracy, he adds. We, at least I, would not want to go back to the crisis of the 70, the 80s, or even the early 90s. And some of the causes of the crisis are because we didn't have enough integration in the past -- the answer is to move forwards, not back. But Draghi also acknowledges the anger and disappointment in parts of the euro area - saying that it's not good enough if people aren't benefitting from growth and jobs. Was the decision unanimous, or did some council members want action today? There was no decision, replies Draghi, coyly- this was a preliminary discussion ahead of June's meeting, remember? Next question - how worried is the ECB that the Ukraine crisis will send the euro higher. Draghi says that if geopolitical tensions deepen, the eurozone will be more badly hit than the rest of the world, due to close ties with Russia. This chart shows how the euro fell sharply as Draghi said the ECB was comfortable with acting next month: The press pack demand more details - what is the ECB governing council comfortable with doing in June, exactly? Draghi replies that there is a consensus on the governing council with being dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation. And there is there is a consensus that they council should not be resigned to a prolonged period of low inflation, and simply accepting it as \" fact of nature\". Is the ECB gearing up for action in June, asks Brian Blackstone of the WSJ. Draghi gives a lengthy answer, saying that he'd describe today's discussion as \"a preview\" of the discussion we are going to have next time. While the recovery is firming up, the governing council is not resigned to inflation remaining at such low levels, he says. Draghi also reiterates that the geopolitical risks facing the eurozone are influencing the exchange rate. Recent weak inflation has been down to food and energy prices - the ECB needs to decide what else is pushing inflation down. The euro's strength is one factor - another is weak domestic demand, and unemployment levels. And then he drops the bombshell: The governing council is comfortable with acting next time, but it wants to see the new economic forecasts drawn up by the ECB staff first [they arrive in early June]. And the euro is tumbling back down..... Next question - is the ECB worried about exchange rates, and the strength of the euro? Draghi says that the ECB doesn't have a target for the euro, but obviously it's a very important issue. A high exchange rate, and low inflation, is a cause for serious concern. What does Draghi think about politicians offering advice about what the ECB should do? Draghi reiterates that ECB is independent, and its credibility could be hurt if people lose faith in it. He said the Bank was \"thankful\" for recent advice - with a touch of sarcasm. Claire Jones of the Financial Times goes first -- asking when a \"prolonged period of inflation\" becomes a \"too prolonged period of inflation\". Draghi explains that the key issue is whether medium-terms inflation expectations have become \"de-anchored\" (rather than people having faith that inflation will rise back to target). The statement ended with Draghi's familiar warning that eurozone country's must not falter in their reform programmes. Onto questions! Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole reckons that Draghi's comments about credit conditions means the ECB is not close to launching QE. Credit conditions have stabilising in recent months, says Mario Draghi -- easing a little for households, but unchanged for firms. Small businesses in some eurozone countries have reported that credit availability has improved recently, but banks are still reporting that conditions are tight in a historical basis. So, limited progress here. It's essential that the \"fragmentation\" in the eurozone banking sector is reduced, Draghi insists, to avoid hampering the recovery. The euro's climbing against the US dollar.... now at $1.3982. On unemployment, Draghi there are signs that the eurozone jobless rate is stabilising but remains high. (It was recorded at 11.8% last month, sharply higher than in the UK or the US). So far, so familiar.... Draghi cites \"Geopolitical risks\" (Ukraine, for starters), and tensions in the developing markets as key causes of downside risk to the euro area. Draghi says inflation remains low in the euro areas, with a high degree of spare capacity. Draghi says the ECB would act swiftly with new monetary stimulus if needed. And he strongly reiterates the ECB's 'forward guidance' -- that interest rates will remain at their present, or lower, levels for a considerable time. Draghi also points out that the ECB will get new economic forecasts in June. And we're off - Draghi says today's meeting was also attended by Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup. The latest data shows that the European economy is recovering moderately, in line with the ECB's forecasts. But it also shows a prolonged period of low inflation, followed by only a gradual rise in prices, Draghi says. The ECB press conference is starting in Brussels. Can Draghi talk the euro down, or might the single currency drive higher?.... It is being streamed live here, and also on Bloomberg TV. With eurozone monetary policy unchanged, the financial markets are - once again - looking to Mario Draghi for guidance on the ECB's thinking when the press conference starts in five minutes.... But can Draghi simply jawbone the markets again, without actually doing anything? Nancy Curtin, CIO at Close Brothers Asset Management says investors are starting to look for action. Without a shadow of a doubt Europe\u2019s fragile economic recovery is gaining ground. Numbers are improving week in week out and we\u2019re seeing signs of improved competitiveness in the periphery. But let\u2019s not forget there are still deep rooted underlying problems. Inflation remains disturbingly low and there are mumblings that economic recovery could falter if euro strength is sustained. What\u2019s more, the general state of the emerging markets has meant a slowdown in these economies has kept a lid on global trade and continued to put downward pressure on tradable goods prices. Ukraine remains a lurking concern. If these issues become worse, Draghi may find himself with little choice but to step in and to bring Europe back to health. Further rate reductions may be the first step but the most likely remedy would be buying of assets through quantitative easing-European style. So far Draghi has done a sound job of talking the talk, and often talking is almost as good as doing it. But investors are starting to look for actual movement - \u2018Will he, won\u2019t he\u2019 has kept many on their toes for several months already. In part because Europe is seen to be recovering in spite of these underlying issues. So far, Draghi hasn\u2019t needed to make a move. However, his positioning in Europe creates an air of uncertainty, adding to the clouds of unease already hovering over many part of the globe. Murky markets in the UK, US and Asia have meant many investors are fairly muted in their risk. By the end of the year we expect the clouds to have cleared for Europe, and quite possibly the UK too, but until then all eyes will be on Draghi\u2019s next move, followed by the China, and then the BOJ. Waiting for policy makers is the new investment normal in a post financial crisis world. The Euro has hit a two-month high of $1.3690 against the US dollar, following the ECB's decision not to change interest rates. And here's the official statement from the European Central Bank, confirming it left interest rates unchanged across the eurozone today. 8 May 2014 - Monetary policy decisions At today\u2019s meeting, which was held in Brussels, the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.25%, 0.75% and 0.00% respectively. Here we go! The ECB has voted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at the record low of 0.25%. Also no change to its other key rates -- at which it lends to or borrows from banks. One down, one to go..... The European Central Bank will release its own monetary policy decision very soon, at 12.45pm BST, ahead of the press conference 45 minutes later. The ECB governing council is in Brussels this month, rather than Frankfurt. Rob Wood of Berenberg Bank has an alternative view -- he thinks Britain's record low borrowing costs are\" increasingly unnecessary and difficult to justify\". He explains: One reason to keep rates on hold for longer would be if wage growth does not pick-up through this year. But wages are already improving, particularly outside the finance and business services sectors. Berenberg expect the first quarter-point rate rise in the first three months of 2015, with a 35% chance that it comes between October and December this year. And hawks on the Monetary Policy Committee could call for rate rises this summer, he added: We look for at least one of the rate setters to break ranks and vote for a hike after the August Inflation Report. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), wants the Bank of England to strengthen its forward guidance, to calm calls for a rate rise everytime some decent economic data is announced: Businesses need clarity that encourages them to increase investment, and at the moment the MPC is delivering this. However its efforts are hampered by repeated calls for interest rate rises whenever a piece of positive news is published. Such a move would be premature. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says there are plenty of reasons for the Bank of England to be considering a rate hike. He thinks rates will remain unchanged until the second quarter of next year, though. With the UK economy seemingly starting off the second quarter strongly following GDP growth of 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter, the unemployment rate falling markedly to 6.9% in three months to February and annual house price inflation moving above 10.0% on the Nationwide\u2019s measure in April, there is growing pressure on the Bank of England to seriously consider hiking interest rates. More reaction to the Bank of England's decision to leave interest rates unchanged, once again... Tell me about it... There's also no statement from the Bank of England. No surprise there either. As Jeremy Cook of World First points out, the BoE face the media next week when it publishes its quarterly inflation report. The Bank of England has just announced that it has left UK interest rates at their current record low of 0.5%. There's also no change in its quantitative easing programme, which remains at \u00a3375bn That's the 62nd month in a row that the BoE has left rates unchanged, dating back to March 2009. Sujatha Krishnan-Barman, financial services analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, warns that the coming months will be tricky for Barclays (especially for staff who are laid off). The bank will still need to reserve capital for the loans in the bad bank, which will constrain lending capacity The large job cuts will make for a painful 12-18 months at Barclays, as the bank seeks to shift its focus from investment banking to retail operations in Britain and in emerging markets.\" Barclays isn't the only company pinning its hopes on a shiny turnaround plan. Supermarket chain Morrisons has been defending its own strategy after reporting a 7% tumble in like-for-like sales in the last 13 weeks. CEO Dalton Philips insists that the company's new \"I'm cheaper\" strategy of price cuts will pay off, in a tough trading environment for most supermarkets. But analysts are far from impressed by today's results. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb described the sales decline was \"dreadful\". After a shaky start, Morrison's share are now up 2.8% today, but have shed almost a quarter of their value so far this year. Brenda Kelly of IG says Morrisons continues to serve up \"cold hard gruel to its shareholders\" Shareholders must be hoping that the firm has deliberately front-loaded all the bad news, but executing such a major turnaround in the full glare of analyst scrutiny is going to be a far harder task than many realise. More here: Morrisons' sales slump by more than 7% Reminder - the Bank of England will announce its latest monetary policy decision in 45 minutes time. It's expected to leave interest rates unchanged, in line with its forward guidance that there is still too much slack in the UK economy: Back to the Barclays conference call with analysts - and Antony Jenkins says that the 7,000 investment bank job cuts will be split between front and back office. Front-office staff will take the hit first, while infrastructure roles will be eliminated more slowly as Barclays develops simpler systems to handle its trading. In the FT (\u00a3), Martin Arnold explains why Barclays is shunting its European banking operations into its new bad bank: The unit is expected to include Barclays\u2019 retail banking businesses in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, which it has been attempting to sell for several years. Losses from its 572 branches in continental Europe widened from \u00a3277m to \u00a3964m last year. Robert Lyddon, General Secretary of international banking network IBOS, says Barclays is now entrenching into its domestic arena and regarding \"overseas business as innately speculative\": This is the apogee of the \u2018home markets\u2019 strategy, pressed on the UK banks by the government and regulators, and designed to deprive UK businesses of access to normal banking services outside the UK. On bonuses, Jenkins says that variable pay will closely track performance across the group in future. On investment banking - and Jenkins says Barclays is determined to cut it down to size. Today, our investment bank consumes too much capital, does not generate enough of a return for shareholders, and is too large (as a proportion of the overall company), says Jenkins. Investment banking is an \"unacceptable drag on Group returns\", he adds. Barclays' presentation to the City is online here, as a pdf. Antony Jenkins insists he can slash the size of the investment bank and still build on its \"leading position\" in the UK and America. 08-May-2014 10:24 - BARCLAYS CEO SAYS AIMS TO BE A GLOBALLY RELEVANT INVESTMENT BANK, BASED ON STRONG US AND UK BASES 08-May-2014 10:25 - BARCLAYS CEO SAYS WILL \"MEANINGFULLY REDUCE\" THE NUMBER OF ITS INVESTMENT BANK CLIENTS There's some head-scratching going on, as the analyst call continues.... If Gapper of the FT is struggling, what hope for the rest of us? And here's a graphic showing how the 14,000 Barclays job cuts planned this year breaks down - half are in 'front office roles', 40% in operations and IT, and 10% in 'central functions'. It doesn't include the extra 5,000 investment banking jobs being eliminated in 2015 and 2016 - which takes the total headcount reduction to 19,000. Africa is an important, exciting part of the world to operate a bank in, Jenkins says. Barclays is planning to be in the top three banks for revenue in South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Botswana and Zambia by 2017, as it aims to serve a growing middle class. Jenkins says that Barclays UK retail banking arm is in a strong position, with15 million retail customers and 800,000 small businesses. It should benefit from the economic recovery in the UK and connected international markets. Jenkins plans to streamline management and eliminate duplication in the supply chain. Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins is now presenting his plan to City analysts. He's explaining that his new strategy will have a 'profound' impact in the way the bank runs. His plan is to focus on areas where Barclays has a competitive advantage, sell or run down areas where it doesn't, and be more rigorous on costs. Here's a graphic from the presentation: Jenkins also says that Barclays investment banking arm has been \"too exposed\" to volatility in the fixed-income (bonds), currencies and commodities business, and the Group has been too exposed to volatility in the Bank. European stock markets are all up this morning, partly driven by relief that Russia beat a \"tactical retreat\" over Ukraine yesterday, by calling for an independence referendum in the East of the country to be postponed. Dovish comments by Fed chair Janet Yellen yesterday is also pushing shares up --- America's central bank chief said interest rates will remain at their record lows for some considerable time yet. In London, the FTSE 100 is up 0.5% or 33 points at 6829. It is being led by Barclays (+6.5%), and BT (+3.5%) -- which reported its first jump in consumer revenues in a decade. Ishaq Siddiqi of ETX Capital explains the mini-rally: Traders were worried that the Fed may suddenly tighten policies and the lack of clarity in forward guidance didn\u2019t help. Yellen\u2019s remarks yesterday however, will go some way in soothing worries about unexpected rate hikes. Adding further support to market sentiment, Russia\u2019s president Putin called on separatists in Ukraine to delay a planned referendum and said his troops had been withdrawn from Ukraine\u2019s border. This move is widely being seen as risk-positive in markets as it shows Russia attempting to de-escalate the crisis. There are now growing hopes that Russia continues down this path and that this latest move isn\u2019t just a one-off. Over in the insurance world, Prudential has reported a 35% drop in individual annuity sales to \u00a336m in the first quarter, which it said reflected the downturn in the market through last year as policyholders increasingly chose to defer retirement. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The Pru said the implications of the big pension shake-up in the March budget \u2013 which means those reaching retirement age no longer have to buy an annuity \u2013 are still uncertain. The insurer said: \"Alongside other market participants, we anticipate a disruption to sales, which could be significant, in the individual annuities market.\" Prudential reported 29% growth in new business profit in the first quarter, with Asia up 20%, the US 67% ahead and the UK 90% higher, thanks to three big bulk annuity deals. Its fund management arm saw net inflows of \u00a31.4bn. Here's Jill Treanor's full news story on Barclay's job cuts and transformation plan: Barclays is axing 19,000 jobs in a radical overhaul of its business, including a dramatic scaling back of its troublesome investment banking operations, where almost one in three jobs are to go. More than half of the 19,000 job cuts will fall in the UK. Facing pressure to bolster the bank's profits, Barclays' chief executive, Antony Jenkins, said: \"This is a bold simplification of Barclays. We will be a focused international bank, operating only in areas where we have capability, scale and competitive advantage.\" The cutbacks will see the headcount reduced to 120,000 by 2016 although Jenkins has previously indicated the number could eventually fall to 100,000 as technology replaces people. More here: Barclays to cut 19,000 jobs as it scales back investment bank business Barclays shares are pushing higher...now up 5.3% today. Four years ago,Tony Hayward was public enemy number one in America, as thousands of gallons of oil gushed into the Gulf of Mexico each day, as the Deepwater Horizon disaster played out. Hayward's response to the crisis, in which 13 people died, cost him his job at BP (he was heavily criticised for saying that he wanted his life back). But today, his rehabilitation in the City is complete - he's been appointed chairman of mining giant Glencore Xstrata. Former BP boss Tony Hayward named Glencore Xstrata chairman In other news this morning, Halifax has reported a surprise dip in house prices in April, which may dampen talk that the market is getting out of control. Halifax said that prices fell by 0.2% month-on-month in April, but were still 8.5% higher than a year ago. Economists had expected to see prices rise by 0.9%. The data may show that the UK's new \"Mortgage Market Review (MMR) rules\", which force applicants to give more details of their spending, are curtailing the market. Stephen Noakes, mortgages director at Halifax, said that demand remains pretty strong, with limited supply helping to drive up prices: \"Housing demand continues to be supported by an economic recovery that is gathering pace, rising consumer confidence, low interest rates and wage growth finally beginning to outgrow consumer prices. \"However, with supply of properties being slow to respond to market conditions, stronger demand in the past year has resulted in upward pressure on house prices.\" The news comes as three former chancellors - Lord Lamont, Lord Lawson and Alistair Darling - all went public with their concerns over the governments' Help to Buy mortgage subsidy scheme, to the FT (more details on Conservative Home). There's rarely too much sympathy for investment bankers, especially since the financial crisis broke out. But the unions point out that thousands of less well-paid staff have suffered in recent years. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, says: \"These have been extraordinarily turbulent times for ordinary Barclays workers who have worked hard to keep the bank on track against a backdrop of continued uncertainty and redundancies. The bank needs to recognise their tireless work to put customers first while jobs have been lost and give reassurances over their futures.\" One for football fans -- or followers of Arsenal, anyway -- from City analyst Ian Gordon of Investec. Barclays may soon resemble the Emirates Stadium with 20 minutes left to play \u2013 there will be over 20,000 empty seats. Gordon has no time for Jenkins' new \"bad bank\" - saying that shoving non-core assets into this vehicle is merely an act of presentation. But he also advises clients to stock up on Barclays shares: What does excite us is the emboldened commitment to deliver underlying costs of \u00a316.3bn by 2015 (vs \u00a318.5bn in 2013) against reasonable revenue give-ups. Buy. Antony Jenkins just popped up on Bloomberg TV to outline his plan. He explained that Barclays is freeing up capital, meaning higher returns for shareholders. He denied that Barclays is in a death spiral, following the swathe of investment bankers (including its top US banker, Skip McGee, last week). Instead, he claimed the Bank is experiencing a 'generational shift'. Earlier this month, Jenkins faced the wrath of small and large investors alike - after Barclays raised its investment banking bonus pool despite profits slumping by 30%. A situation where bonuses are up, and profits are down, will not be repeated at Barclays, Jenkins pledged. Sounds like Barclays is determined to pull out of European retail banking. Speaking on CNBC, Jenkins said he could decide to sell or float parts of its European retail banking operations, which are all being put into a \"bad bank\". He said: \"A sale or an IPO would be a potential option for the assets we have in there,\" William Wright, former editor of Financial News, flags up that around half the risk-weighted assets (RWA) which Barclays is shovelling into its new bad bank were already earmarked for the axe: The City likes the sound of Jenkins' plan -- shares in Barclays jumped 3.5% at the start of trading to 251.7p, a gain of 8.7p. Fund manager Colin McLean, of SVM Asset Management, has warned that executing Jenkins' plan will not be easy. Speaking on Radio 4's Today Programme, McLean explained that much depends on Barclays' ability to maintain profits and revenues while pulling away from 'non-core' divisions, and shrinking its investment banking operation. Some instant reaction to the plan More than half of the 19,000 job cuts will fall within the UK, our City editor Jill Treanor flags up. In February, Jenkins signalled that 12,000 jobs were going, with 7,000 in the UK -- around 4,000 of those roles have already been cut (between the retail and investment banking arms). Antony Jenkins, who became CEO in 2012, says today's changes will deliver \"a bold simplification of Barclays.\" We will be a focused international bank, operating only in areas where we have capability, scale and competitive advantage. In the future, Barclays will be leaner, stronger, much better balanced and well positioned to deliver lower volatility, higher returns, and growth. My goal is unchanged: to create a Barclays that does business in the right way, with the right values, and delivers the returns that our shareholders deserve. However, the way in which we will achieve this is different. Today we are setting out how we will reach that goal and create the 'Go-To' bank for our customers and clients, our colleagues and our shareholders.\" The Barclays turnaround plan is designed to simplify the bank, and leave it with four key divisions: Personal and Corporate Banking -- a combination of its leading UK Retail, Corporate and Wealth businesses Its credit card division, Barclaycard Banking service in Africa Investment Bank. which will deliver \"Banking, Equities, Credit and certain Macro products to our clients in a more capital efficient way\" Sweeping changes at Barclays have just been announced, as CEO Antony Jenkins finally unveils his heavily anticipated vision for the Bank. Under the plan, 19,000 jobs will be cut over the next three years - in a bid to cut costs and drive profitability. That's up from the 12,000 announced in February -- with an extra 7,000 investment bankers being let go by the end of 2016. 2,000 of the investment banking jobs will be cut this year - taking the total headcount reduction to 14,000. A further 5,000 will leave in the next two years, Jenkins is determined to shrink the Investment Bank until it is no more than 30% of the Group total by 2016, compared to just over 50% now. The legacy of his predecessor, Bob Diamond, is being unpicked.... Barclays is also creating a new 'bad bank' to house various non-core assets. As it put it: Barclays today also announces the creation of Barclays Non-Core. This unit groups together those assets which do not fit the strategic objectives or returns criteria underlying the Strategy Review. That will include \u00a390bn of investment bank assets and Barclays entire European retail banking assets, worth \u00a316bn. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Busy day ahead, with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank both holding their monthly monetary policy meetings. We're not expecting any major changes, but Mario Draghi's press conference (from 1.30pm) will be as unmissable as ever. In the corporate world -- Barclays is announcing its long-awaited strategic plan, with thousands of investment bankers being let go. Morrisons, BT and Centrica are all reporting results too. And in the financial markets, shares are expected to rise after Russian president Vladimir Putin pulled a Ukrainian u-turn yesterday, and called for pro-Russia separatists in the east of the countrry to pause their referedum.

      "bodyText": "BT's \u00a32bn bet on sports broadcasting has lifted annual revenues at its consumer division for the first time in a decade, with a 4% increase to just over \u00a34bn, as it took the lion's share of new broadband subscribers. The launch of two live sports channels, broadcast from the former Olympic park in Stratford last summer, improved the brand, according to Gavin Patterson, the chief executive, who masterminded the push into football in his previous role as boss of the group's retail arm. \"There has been more of a buzz around BT, which opens us up to a wider group of customers,\" he said. A television offering boosted by Premier League and Champions League football helped BT secure 170,000 net new broadband subscribers in the most recent quarter \u2013 subscribers get the sports channels free. This was a 79% share of all new broadband homes on the BT network, which is also used by other operators including Sky and TalkTalk, and it beat Sky's 70,000 net new subscribers in the same period. Virgin broadband is on a separate network. BT now has 1 million paying television customers, according to its full-year results on Thursday, adding 46,000 in the quarter, thanks to the demand for Premier League football. But the total number of homes watching its sports channels is 5m if those getting the service via Sky and Virgin Media set-top boxes are included. Patterson played down expectations that BT is planning to snatch the lion's share of Premier League rights from Sky when the auction for the next three-year deal begins later this year, saying his options remained open. Having already secured the next Champions League, BT will have 350 live games a season from 2015. \"Come next Premier League auction, we've got more choice in terms of our strategy,\" he said. \"If we don't decide to increase the number of games we go for, we've still got a very strong schedule based around Europe.\" The telecoms group beat forecasts to report overall revenues flat on last year at \u00a318.3bn, and announced a 15% dividend increase with more over the next two years. BT shares rose nearly 3% to 388p. But television signings have slowed, from a peak of 70,000 in September, just after the launch of BT Sport. The company has insisted its investment in football was all about stopping the slow bleed of phone and broadband customers to Sky and other operators. Since the launch of BT Sport last summer, its share of all new broadband signings is now typically higher than 75%, compared with 50% before. It also said it had completed its project to extend superfast fibre-optic cables to street cabinets serving two-thirds of the UK, 21 months ahead of schedule. BT's network now passes 19m premises, and work has started on all 44 local authority contracts to build a publicly funded rural network that will extend fibre to more than 90% of the country. BT said some 630,000 homes had now been connected under the Broadband Delivery UK scheme. Communications minister Ed Vaizey said: \"The UK now has the widest fibre availability of the top five European economies as well as the highest takeup rate. Commercial operators like BT, with support from government, are delivering one of the fastest rollouts of fibre in the world and these figures demonstrate that the government's aim to provide access to superfast speeds to 95% of the UK by 2017 is well on track.\" Demand for superfast fibre-optic broadband is running at an all-time high, with a new customer connected to BT's network every 20 seconds. Over the past quarter, 347,000 were plugged in, and there are now 2.7 million, with 2.1 million buying the service from the company itself and the rest from operators such as Sky and TalkTalk. \"Fibre broadband is the future and BT has invested billions of pounds to ensure as many people as possible can benefit,\" said Patterson. \"The early achievement of this milestone marks the culmination of several years of hard work by our engineers and planners.\" Overall profit at the group was ahead of expectations, with adjusted profit before tax 9% higher at \u00a3901m for the quarter. Patterson said revenues would be flat during the coming financial year, but would grow in the year ending March 2016. He increased the full-year dividend by 15% to 10.9p, with a final dividend 15% higher at 7.5p. BT expects to increase its dividend by between 10% and 15% for each of the next two years.",

      "bodyText": "Morrisons has reported a 7.1% slump in sales in the past three months, but its chief executive claimed the turnaround strategy was on track as a new price cutting campaign started. Dalton Philips said he was confident that the \"I'm cheaper\" price cuts, which permanently lowered prices by an average of 17% on 1,200 products a week ago, will draw in customers. The struggling supermarket chain, which bills itself as a value-led grocer with a focus on fresh food, even projected the image of a giant baguette on to the Angel of the North in Gateshead as part of its campaign. Total sales excluding fuel fell 4.2% in the 13 weeks to 4 May, while like-for-like sales tumbled 7.1%. This was a bigger fall than analysts had expected and compares with a decline of 5.6% over Christmas and a 2.8% drop last year. The company said its big cost savings programme was on track and did not change its \u00a3325m to \u00a3375m profit guidance for 2014. Philips set out plans in March to save \u00a31bn over the next three years. Morrisons has been changing the layout of its stores, has invested in IT and has opened 11 local convenience stores during the quarter \u2013 with a target to have up to 200 open by the end of the year. The independent retail analyst Nick Bubb described the sales figures as \"dreadful\". He said: \"Price deflation will make the sales figures worse not better in the short run, before sales volumes pick up. Fortunately, the big cost savings programme is on track. \"Management will be under pressure to explain the thinking behind the new 'I'm cheaper' price campaign, given the scepticism expressed by Sainsbury's yesterday on how real their price cuts are.\" The outgoing Sainsbury's boss, Justin King, dismissed the \u00a3300m of price cuts announced by Morrisons as a \"skirmish\".

NSW acting assistant police commissioner Mark Walton said at a press conference on Wednesday that police had officially begun inquiries into the incident in which two of Australia\u2019s most powerful men fought in the street. Billionaire Packer, and Gyngell, the head of the Nine Network, came to blows on Sunday, reportedly over a misunderstanding about a Nine camera truck which Packer believed was camped out to catch the arrival of his rumoured partner, supermodel Miranda Kerr. News Corp reportedly bought photographs of the fight for more than $200,000 on Monday, publishing them online behind heavy watermarks before plastering various snapshots across the nation\u2019s front pages the following day. The watermarked images were quickly ridiculed \u2013 including by some News Corp publications. \"The early material was so difficult to see what was going on because of the branding of it,\" Walton told media on Wednesday. \"I certainly wasn't expecting the police to rush out there.\" A spokesman for NSW police told Guardian Australia Walton was not joking. The watermarks \u201cgenuinely made it very hard to see through what was going on in the background\u201d, he said. The spokesman could not confirm whether police had earlier requested unmarked copies of the photographs from News Corp. The police investigation \u2013 which was launched despite no complaint filed by either Packer or Gyngell \u2013 will determine whether the fight amounted to assault or affray. Walton acknowledged police were slow to begin an investigation, but said they had now made contact with legal representatives of both Packer and Gyngell requesting an interview with the pair. \u201cWe have had contact through a legal adviser indicating if they wish to indicate anything to us, come and see us, they're welcome to do so,\" he said. \"There's no compulsion for anyone to be interviewed in these circumstances.\" A lack of police action in the days immediately following the incident attracted some criticism that Packer and Gyngell appeared to be escaping consequences at a time when government and law enforcement are focusing so heavily on violence in Sydney. Walton said the profiles of the two men had \u201cno relevance to the determination in this matter\u201d.

And while that is high, the average taxable income of the top 1% was a rather more sizeable $588,893.</p> <p>The discussion of the deficit levy, however, has varied across the past week from it kicking in at the second highest tax-rate threshold of $80,000 to the recent reports it will begin at $150,000.</p> <p>Are any of these \u201caverage Australians\u201d?</p> <p>This is where is gets confusing and also allows for a bit of trickiness.</p> <p>Take for example<a href=\"http://www.ipa.org.au/publications/2258/abbott-government-should-not-punish-aspirational-australians-ipa\"> the Institute of Public Affairs</a>, which issued a media release decrying the deficit levy, stating, \u201cSomeone earning $80,000 a year is well off, but they\u2019re not rich. Teachers and nurses can earn well in excess of $80,000 per annum.\u201d</p> <p>The problem with this is that \u201crich\u201d and \u201cwell off\u201d are subjective terms. So let\u2019s put some figures into the equation.</p> <p>The average full-time annual earnings is $75,000, which suggests $80,000 is not that far above it. But of course not everyone works full-time (and the amount is also different for women \u2013 average full-time earnings for women is about $67,000). The average total earnings, which cover all employees, is about $58,000.</p> <p>So that\u2019s a fair drop.</p> <p>But \u201caverage\u201d is misleading, because it is skewed by higher incomes. If you have five people earning $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 and $130,000, then the average is $54,000, but only one person in the group earns that amount.</p> <p>When we most often talk of \u201caverage\u201d (or Shorten\u2019s \u201cordinary\u201d) Australians, we\u2019re actually more likely to be thinking \u201cmedian\u201d \u2013 ie middle income, the point where half of the people earn more and half earn less.</p> <p>And in 2011-12, the median taxable income was not $75,000, nor $58,000, but just $49,600. Which means that someone on $80,000 is 60% above the median income.</p> <p>Earning $80,000 puts you in the top 20% of all income earners, $100,000 gets you into the top 12%, $150,000 into the top 5% and $180,000 has you in the top 3%. And yes, the wealthy pay most of the tax. The top 20%, for example, pay about 61% of all tax, but they also earn about 45% of all income:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" data-alt=\"graph three\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/3WPP9/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"600\"></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Interestingly, our view of \u201cwell-off\u201d would not have changed due to the changes to 2nd highest tax bracket changes. The ratio of that threshold to the median taxable income has stayed pretty constant since 2002. The top tax threshold, however, has zoomed away from the median income:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" data-alt=\"graph four\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/jM0SG/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2003-04 the top tax threshold was only 1.8 times the median taxable income. If we had the same ratio now, the top tax threshold would kick in at $99,000 \u2013 if being \u201crich\u201d is to be part of the top tax bracket, then you need a lot more money to be rich than you used to.</p> <p>But it is worth remembering median income changes according to your family situation.</p> <p>The median income for a family of four is not the same as for a single person. Clearly it costs more to feed and house four people than one. The ABS takes this into account when it works out the \u201cequivalised household income\u201d. Its latest data for 2011-12 projected that the median income for a single person after tax had been paid and benefits received was $41,080. But for a family of four (two adults and two kids) the median household income would be $86,000.</p> <p>Now if that household had only one earner then she or he would individually be in the top 20% of incomes, but his/her whole household would be smack bang in middle Australia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" data-alt=\"graph five\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/zHbVJ/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That is why family tax benefit parts A and B exist, even for families whose household taxable income is more than $100,000, and why \u201cmiddle-class\u201d welfare is perhaps more accurate than its deriders suggest. It\u2019s also why changes to the family tax benefit which may affect households earning more than $100,000 will be much more likely to hit \u201cordinary Australians\u201d than will a deficit levy for those earning $80,000, let alone anyone on $150,000.</p> <p>And even more crucially, the prime minister, Tony Abbott, is promising the deficit levy will be temporary. The cuts to family assistance, however, will permanent. If Shorten was really worried about ordinary Australians, family tax benefit is where he should focus his attack.</p>",

When we most often talk of \u201caverage\u201d (or Shorten\u2019s \u201cordinary\u201d) Australians, we\u2019re actually more likely to be thinking \u201cmedian\u201d \u2013 ie middle income, the point where half of the people earn more and half earn less. And in 2011-12, the median taxable income was not $75,000, nor $58,000, but just $49,600. Which means that someone on $80,000 is 60% above the median income. Earning $80,000 puts you in the top 20% of all income earners, $100,000 gets you into the top 12%, $150,000 into the top 5% and $180,000 has you in the top 3%. And yes, the wealthy pay most of the tax. The top 20%, for example, pay about 61% of all tax, but they also earn about 45% of all income: Interestingly, our view of \u201cwell-off\u201d would not have changed due to the changes to 2nd highest tax bracket changes. The ratio of that threshold to the median taxable income has stayed pretty constant since 2002. The top tax threshold, however, has zoomed away from the median income: In 2003-04 the top tax threshold was only 1.8 times the median taxable income. If we had the same ratio now, the top tax threshold would kick in at $99,000 \u2013 if being \u201crich\u201d is to be part of the top tax bracket, then you need a lot more money to be rich than you used to. But it is worth remembering median income changes according to your family situation. The median income for a family of four is not the same as for a single person. Clearly it costs more to feed and house four people than one. The ABS takes this into account when it works out the \u201cequivalised household income\u201d. Its latest data for 2011-12 projected that the median income for a single person after tax had been paid and benefits received was $41,080. But for a family of four (two adults and two kids) the median household income would be $86,000. Now if that household had only one earner then she or he would individually be in the top 20% of incomes, but his/her whole household would be smack bang in middle Australia. That is why family tax benefit parts A and B exist, even for families whose household taxable income is more than $100,000, and why \u201cmiddle-class\u201d welfare is perhaps more accurate than its deriders suggest. It\u2019s also why changes to the family tax benefit which may affect households earning more than $100,000 will be much more likely to hit \u201cordinary Australians\u201d than will a deficit levy for those earning $80,000, let alone anyone on $150,000. And even more crucially, the prime minister, Tony Abbott, is promising the deficit levy will be temporary. The cuts to family assistance, however, will permanent. If Shorten was really worried about ordinary Australians, family tax benefit is where he should focus his attack.",
