    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has issued a blunt warning to potential home-owners that they must be able to pay their mortgages when interest rates go up and not rely on being bailed out of any future difficulties by rising house prices. In an interview with the Guardian, Mark Carney said on Friday that Threadneedle Street's decision to rein in mortgage lending was designed to head off a boom-bust in the property market at an early stage and avoid drastic policy action in the event of a bubble. \"Think about the mortgage you are taking on, the debts you are taking on,\" Carney said when asked what his message was to those aspiring to get on the housing ladder. \"You are taking at least a 25-year mortgage, maybe a 30-year mortgage. \"Are you going to be able to service that mortgage five years from now, 10 years from now, if interest rates are higher? Or are you counting, even subconsciously, on the price of your house keeping going up and if something happens an ability to sell it quickly and not facing the consequences of not being able to pay?\" Carney was speaking as the latest data from Nationwide building society showed annual house price inflation at 6.5% \u2013 its highest since July 2010. The governor expressed concern about the lack of new homes being built as the Bank's own figures demonstrated that demand for property was strong. Mortgage approvals are running at levels not seen since Northern Rock was nationalised in February 2008. In a wide-ranging interview that included bankers' pay, City scandals, the Co-op bank rescue plan and his plans for the Bank of England, Carney said: \u2022 Reform of the conduct of the financial sector is overdue. \u2022 The Bank is increasing its scrutiny of bank executives following the scandal at the Co-op involving the Rev Paul Flowers. \u2022 The Bank of England is anxious for the private-sector restructuring of the Co-op to go ahead but would step in with its own rescue if bondholders rejected the deal. \u2022 He opposes the cap imposed by Brussels on bankers' bonuses, due to come into force next month. \u2022 He wants more women in senior positions at the Bank of England to address the gender imbalance at the top. The newly appointed Canadian governor of the Bank justified the decision by the Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) to end Funding for Lending for home loans a year earlier than planned. The scheme has been regarded as crucial in reviving the housing market since it was introduced in August 2012. It offers lenders cheap money in return for loans to customers, but from the new year it will be limited to business lending \u2013 still falling according to fresh figures from the Bank. \"The right way to do policy \u2013 to protect against the boom and bust cycles \u2013 is to act early in a graduated, proportionate way and that reduces the probability of having to act in a bigger way later.\" He added: \"I'm less concerned about the housing market, given the steps the FPC has taken.\" He said that Britain was building half as many homes a year as Canada despite having a population twice as large, and added: \"It is widely acknowledged that there is a very large supply-side issue here. \"I fully recognise that Canada is the second-biggest country in the world. It's easy to build housing as it's easy to find places [to build]. But it does give you a sense of the issues around the constraints on supply and the movements in prices you see as well. They all reinforce that sense that there is a supply issue. And there's nothing the Bank of England can do to change that.\" The governor expressed a reluctance to use interest rates as a way of cooling down the housing market because it would affect all parts of an economy only just recovering from recession. \"You could use [interest rates] to address financial stability but it is a very blunt tool. It hits all aspects of the economy from the south to the north from across manufacturing. It affects exporters. It has a range of impacts \u2013 SMEs [small and medium-sized firms] as much as people borrowing for detached homes in Knightsbridge.\" House prices are forecast to climb a further 10% next year and the Bank of England has embarked on a range of measures to try to temper the appetite for home loans. Affordability tests being introduced next year will require mortgage lenders to assess a borrowers' ability to repay a loan and lenders will be watched to ensure they do not relax lending criteria too much. \"What we don't want to see is a marked deterioration in underwriting standards that often happens, whether it's here or abroad, when a housing cycle really gathers momentum. It's one of the things that feeds momentum, so we want to see prudence from lenders,\" Carney said. The governor said the Bank had enough powers to prevent a housing bubble as the FPC can recommend to the regulators that lenders take a tougher stance on the size of a mortgage compared to the value of the house \u2013 the so-called loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. He said that if the Bank did in the future recommend any caps on LTVs, he expected lenders to heed the warning. \"We have to make the case to act, convince people of the case, but it is not insubstantial if the FPC stands up and recommends that there should be a cap on loan to values just as a hypothetical example,\" Carney said.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Governor faces some familiar problems: a bank on the ropes, City pay, and how to prevent a recovery in the housing market derailing the economy", 
      "body": "<p>In his five months as governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney has shaken things up. He has won plaudits for putting Jane Austen on banknotes, appointed a woman to be chief operating officer in the male bastion of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, started conducting media interviews to explain his actions \u2013 and this week took the first steps to rein in the housing market.</p> <p>He is also dispensing with the tradition, used by his predecessors, of being addressed formally as Mr Governor. \"Call me Mark,\" he says.</p> <p>But some things are not for changing. A pink-coated waiter still greets visitors and guides them through the rabbit warren of a building, centred on a secret courtyard, to the governor's private parlours. The waiters remain, as do some of the problems that would have been familiar to his predecessors: a bank on the ropes, City pay, and how to prevent a recovery in the housing market derailing the economy.</p> <p>Carney does not want to talk about his private life but says it is a privilege to have his \u00a3800,000-a-year job. His five-year tenure began in July just as the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall at the Co-operative Bank was revealed. The first deadline for a crucial restructuring passed on Friday night. It should leave the once mutually-owned bank 70% controlled by outside shareholders, including a group of aggressive hedge funds.</p> <p>The governor stresses the importance of this rescue going ahead, adding that the Bank is waiting in the wings if it should collapse. \"We are very focused on how that restructuring proceeds. I'd underscore that it is very much in the interests of all bondholders of the Co-op, particularly individual bondholders who might not think it's necessarily in their interests \u2026 to think very hard about their choices. Because the alternative to this restructuring would be resolution [winding down] for the group.\"</p> <p>He says an investigation at the Bank of England is under way by its regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and it will decide shortly whether a full-blown inquiry into individuals' actions is needed. Meanwhile, much stricter interviews are now being conducted to ensure that a bank could not appoint someone like the Rev Paul Flowers, disgraced former Co-operative chairman, to head a financial institution.</p> <p>\"There has been a change in the approval process \u2026 for people in these senior positions, chairman, board members and chief executive offices of the firms. There is much more discipline around the structure.\"</p> <p>The financial crisis and its aftermath have unearthed widespread wrongdoing in the City, from the fixing of Libor to laundering of drug money and the mis-selling of protection payment insurance. The latest allegations centre on whether the Royal Bank of Scotland deliberately forced viable businesses to the brink to enable the bailed-out bank to make a profit on buying up their properties. RBS denies the claims, which Carney has said are \"deeply troubling and extremely serious\".</p> <p>Asked whether any part of the City could now be considered clean, Carney doesn't exactly provide an answer, saying only: \"What's happening is heightened scrutiny on a wide range of conduct issues, which is right. It is overdue. And so more is coming to light.\"</p> <p>The governor says there are three pillars for a successful City: resilience, integrity and innovation. While stressing the importance of the financial sector to the UK economy, he adds: \"There are issues that have to be addressed and they are being addressed.

      "bodyText": "In his five months as governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney has shaken things up. He has won plaudits for putting Jane Austen on banknotes, appointed a woman to be chief operating officer in the male bastion of the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, started conducting media interviews to explain his actions \u2013 and this week took the first steps to rein in the housing market. He is also dispensing with the tradition, used by his predecessors, of being addressed formally as Mr Governor. \"Call me Mark,\" he says. But some things are not for changing. A pink-coated waiter still greets visitors and guides them through the rabbit warren of a building, centred on a secret courtyard, to the governor's private parlours. The waiters remain, as do some of the problems that would have been familiar to his predecessors: a bank on the ropes, City pay, and how to prevent a recovery in the housing market derailing the economy. Carney does not want to talk about his private life but says it is a privilege to have his \u00a3800,000-a-year job. His five-year tenure began in July just as the \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall at the Co-operative Bank was revealed. The first deadline for a crucial restructuring passed on Friday night. It should leave the once mutually-owned bank 70% controlled by outside shareholders, including a group of aggressive hedge funds. The governor stresses the importance of this rescue going ahead, adding that the Bank is waiting in the wings if it should collapse. \"We are very focused on how that restructuring proceeds. I'd underscore that it is very much in the interests of all bondholders of the Co-op, particularly individual bondholders who might not think it's necessarily in their interests \u2026 to think very hard about their choices. Because the alternative to this restructuring would be resolution [winding down] for the group.\" He says an investigation at the Bank of England is under way by its regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and it will decide shortly whether a full-blown inquiry into individuals' actions is needed. Meanwhile, much stricter interviews are now being conducted to ensure that a bank could not appoint someone like the Rev Paul Flowers, disgraced former Co-operative chairman, to head a financial institution. \"There has been a change in the approval process \u2026 for people in these senior positions, chairman, board members and chief executive offices of the firms. There is much more discipline around the structure.\" The financial crisis and its aftermath have unearthed widespread wrongdoing in the City, from the fixing of Libor to laundering of drug money and the mis-selling of protection payment insurance. The latest allegations centre on whether the Royal Bank of Scotland deliberately forced viable businesses to the brink to enable the bailed-out bank to make a profit on buying up their properties. RBS denies the claims, which Carney has said are \"deeply troubling and extremely serious\". Asked whether any part of the City could now be considered clean, Carney doesn't exactly provide an answer, saying only: \"What's happening is heightened scrutiny on a wide range of conduct issues, which is right. It is overdue. And so more is coming to light.\" The governor says there are three pillars for a successful City: resilience, integrity and innovation. While stressing the importance of the financial sector to the UK economy, he adds: \"There are issues that have to be addressed and they are being addressed. At the same time there are fundamental strengths in the British financial system and they are being reinforced. \"There are strengths in the City. There are sound organisations in terms of balance sheets, values and the way that they operate. Those organisations are very innovative, they are part of what makes the UK financial system a global good and a national asset, something that helps keep an open global system that is a benefit to the UK.\" On the thorny issue of whether bankers are paid too much, Carney is also reluctant to be drawn. But he is adamant that the EU cap on bonuses \u2013 which comes into force on 1 January \u2013 is the wrong way to deal with putting a lid on pay. Carney is worried that restricting bonuses to 100% of salary (or 200% with the explicit backing of shareholders) could \"tilt the structure\" of pay deals in favour of short-termism. The Bank is fully behind attempts by UK regulators to force top bankers to spread their bonuses across at least three years and claw back pay if losses occur. Even so, he accepts that changing pay structures is no substitute for changing the culture. \"You can't design the perfect compensation structure to deliver integrity.\"",

      "bodyText": "Labour has called for BT to cut line rental charges, which will rise to more than \u00a3190 a year from January, as the party reveals its eight-point plan to protect consumers against the \"great phone ripoff\". The shadow communications minister, Helen Goodman, published the plan on Friday to cut broadband, landline and mobile phone costs for households. The coalition is expected to make a similar announcement next month, as the parties turn their firepower on energy companies and telecoms firms in the search for votes. Following the success of Ed Miliband's stance on gas and electricity bills, which the Labour leader wants to freeze for 20 months after the 2015 general election, the government is looking to address the cost of living in next week's autumn statement and has already met with telecoms companies to extract concessions. BT is increasing prices across the board in January, with monthly line rental due to rise by 50 pence from \u00a315.45 to \u00a315.95. Labour says that with householders paying \u00a3130 for the installation of a new residential line, the first month's landline charge means they will face a \u00a3145.45 bill before even making a phone call. \"The government must act to reduce BT's charges now,\" said Goodman. \"Having a mobile or a fixed line should not be a luxury item \u2013 most people need them in their everyday life. It's time the government took action to protect consumers against the great phone ripoff.\" Labour is also calling for: \u2022 The option to receive paper bills without a financial penalty. The four mobile operators charge between \u00a315 and \u00a318 per year for paper bills, which Labour says hits vulnerable customers hardest. \u2022 Free caller identification to prevent nuisance calls. BT charges \u00a31.75 a month to display the caller's number. Goodman says the service should be free to protect vulnerable and elderly people from pushy sellers such as payday loan companies. \u2022 Outlawing of mid-contract price rises, which have been imposed by mobile operators on customers who thought they had signed up to fixed charges. Ofcom is banning these rises for all contracts signed from January 2014, but Labour says the rules should apply to all existing contracts retrospectively. \u2022 Free mobile calls to 0800 numbers. Some operators charge 21p a minute, while 0800 calls from landlines cost nothing. \u2022 A cap on the amount a customer has to pay for bills run up before reporting a phone lost or stolen. Labour wants a maximum similar to the \u00a350 liability on stolen credit cards. \u2022 Easier switching between mobile networks, and between combined phone, TV and broadband suppliers. Landline charges are an outdated concept, according to Goodman. Almost two thirds of households would get rid of their landline if it wasn't required for broadband access, relying on mobiles and on internet call applications like Skype instead, a study by ISP Review has found. Paper bills are a big issue with customers. \"Without paper statements, customers become more likely to miss payments and less likely to have a handle on their finances,\" said Goodman. The Guardian revealed energy companies have been overbilling customers by at least \u00a3650m per year. Over 40% of those with paper bills noticed the overcharging, but only 29% with online bills spotted the errors. BT pointed out that it offered basic line rental, with a small call allowance but no broadband, to those on low incomes for \u00a34.95 a month. A spokesman said: \"These figures are wrong as the vast majority of people don't need to pay for a new phone line. There are strong measures in place to ensure vulnerable people get cheaper prices and so we are surprised to face such criticism.\"",

    "webTitle": "Tesco boss faces chorus of scepticism on profit margins", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Tesco fightback is now 22 months old, if one takes the starting date as the day in January 2012 that Philip Clarke, then the newish chief executive, delivered a thumping profit warning and confessed that the UK business had been \"running hot for too long.\" It was a polite way of saying that Sir Terry Leahy, his predecessor, had taken his eye off the ball as he pursued expensive foreign adventures, notably in the US and China. The remedy was to invest \u00a31bn in the UK stores to generate \"a step change\" in performance. Investors are still waiting. If the City analysts are right (which is the way to bet), next Wednesday's trading numbers will be horrible. Like-for-like sales in the UK could be down 1.5% in the latest quarter. It will be hard for Clarke to repeat his half-year boast that Tesco's UK performance has strengthened. The group is losing market share and Aldi, Lidl and Waitrose are the current winners. But a longer-standing Clarke boast obsesses the City. He has claimed he can reinvigorate Tesco in the UK while maintaining profit margins at 5.2%. How? The supermarket game comes with high fixed costs, and traditional wisdom says a fall in same-store sales implies a greater fall in profits. How can Clarke hope to defy the maths and maintain margins? Theories abound. Is Tesco actually taking chunks out of costs? Surely not, since Clarke has been adding staff, trying to shorten queues, and smartening stores. Is it squeezing suppliers? That's broker Cantor Fitzgerald's explanation. Or is it pushing up prices and hoping that higher-spending customers stay loyal if they are thrown enough coupons? Or is the official line \u2013 that the trick can be achieved by replacing sales of low-margin TVs with high-margin Finest food products \u2013 correct? Whatever the truth, Clarke faces a chorus of scepticism that he can hold the line on profit margins. JP Morgan thinks weak trading will deliver only 5.1% this year, followed by 4.6% next, and offers a sharp diagnosis: \"We believe that UK industry margins are too high relative to other European markets.\" If Aldi and Lidl did not exist, argues JP Morgan, there wouldn't be a problem. But the continental invaders are now a force: \"As the discounters keep re-engineering their product quality and price, we believe that the core own label of the big players is no longer competitive. We expect Asda to break ranks and force industry margins down.\" If that's a plausible plotline, should Tesco abandon its 5.2% target and take the lead in cutting prices? The strategy could be pitched to investors as a necessary short-term measure to get more customers through the doors to experience the apparent wonders of the new Giraffe cafes, Harris + Hoole coffee shops and tidier aisles. Clarke is probably not ready to alter course, since chief executives tend not to be panicked by a single weak quarter. But he is no longer a new boss and Tesco's overseas operations, where sales trends are even worse, provide no shelter. He's got a big call to make. Now that he has correctly diagnosed the error of Leahy's later years, it will not look clever if he tries to defend a target that is too hot to handle. One of these days, this column will take a vow of silence on Royal Mail's underpriced privatisation. But not quite yet, because the research notes from the previously gagged analysts (those from banks working on the sale) point to a theme that was barely mentioned at the time of flotation and has been largely ignored during the business select committee's disappointing postmortem. Those analysts, almost uniformly, think Royal Mail's dividends could become a thing of wonder. They may not put it like that, but look at Goldman Sachs' forecast for the dividend payout: \u00a3200m this year, which Royal Mail has already announced; then \u00a3282m; then \u00a3352m; then \u00a3414m in the 2016-17 financial year. That's a compound growth rate of 27.5% for three years. Very few FTSE 100 companies, as Royal Mail soon will be, can match those hopes. Then consider how Goldman's analyst thinks the dividend can be cranked up so rapidly. He does not expect fancy balance-sheet games, like taking on a tower of debt. Instead, it's down to cash generation. Goldman thinks Royal Mail, with \u00a3723m of net debt at last count, can be transformed to a position of net cash of \u00a3207m in March 2017, even after paying those dividends. Nothing is guaranteed, of course, and Royal Mail is a stock that comes with well-advertised risks. But, come on, at the float price of 330p, the starting dividend yield was 6%, which was attractive in itself. If there is also a sporting chance of the dividend doubling by 2017, the shares were chronically underpriced. Goldman's 50-page report sets a \"12-month price target\" for the shares of 610p. The MPs, if they want to get to the bottom of the affair, should ask whether ministers really appreciated Royal Mail's dividend potential under its new, far more generous, regulatory regime. Were they blinded by an obsession with the risk of a strike? For the record, here's Goldman's view of the effect on its forecasts of any strike: \"Given the potential for variable and wage cost savings, a minor impact.\" Was Royal Bank of Scotland merely incompetent in its lending to small businesses? Or has it also been tipping companies into insolvency and then buying their assets at knockdown prices? The former allegation was the gist of Sir Andrew Large's verdict on RBS, as contained in a report commissioned by the bank itself. RBS did not have processes and systems to meet its own lending targets. It overcorrected for previous reckless lending. This is serious stuff, undoubtedly, but should not be of direct interest to the Financial Conduct Authority, since commercial lending is not a regulated activity. The right response is the one RBS has taken: overhaul the machinery of lending. But the second allegation is explosive. Lawrence Tomlinson, an adviser to the department for business, alleges that viable businesses have been deliberately wrecked to make a profit for RBS. That plainly requires a full investigation and the FCA was right to insist that it, and not RBS, appoint the investigator. And, if RBS is guilty of disgraceful and possibly fraudulent behaviour, the regulator should hit the bank with everything it's got. Outsiders can only keep an open mind at this stage. But one can understand why RBS' board is mighty miffed, to put it mildly, not to have been given a chance to respond to Tomlinson before he published. Investing is easy with hindsight, but here's a bet you might wish you had made on 1 January: put an equal sum into each of the 11 companies in the FTSE 350 index who had women chief executives. Your portfolio would include two fallers: Imperial Tobacco (Alison Cooper), down 2%, and Anglo American (Cynthia Carroll, now departed), 28% lower. But they would more than outweighed by gainers like BTG (Louise Makin), up 67%, and easyJet (Carolyn McCall), 86% higher. Overall, the women-only portfolio would have returned 28%, which is rather better than 12% for FTSE 100 index, the 22% by the FTSE 250 and the 14% by the FTSE 350 itself. Statistically meaningless? Absolutely. The performance period is too brief, performance versus rivals matters more, and 11 companies is too few. But the fact that there are only 11 is perhaps the real problem.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. And the week. Here's a reminder of the main points: The eurozone's club of AAA nations shrank to three today after S&amp;P stripped the Netherlands of its top credit rating. S&amp;P downgraded the Dutch to AA+, citing weak growth prospects and high households indebtedness. Finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said he was disappointed by the downgrade, but took it seriously, and suggested structural economic reforms would help stimulate growth. S&amp;P had better news for Cyprus, which was upgraded, and Spain, whose outlook was raised to stable. Here's the analyst reaction. Eurozone youth unemployment hit a new record high of 24.4% last month. It hit 57.4% in Spain. Data from Eurostat also showed that the headline rate dropped for the first time in three years. And inflation also rose, to 0.9%, easing fears the disinflation was setting in. In Greece, there is confusion tonight over whether the Troika has cancelled its next visit to Athens. Finance minister Yannis Stournaras tells us that it may be postponed.... And campaigners keen to clean up the City were alarmed to see that the number of EU-based bankers earning at least \u20ac1m rose 11% last year, with three quarters based in the UK. Have good weekends, all. See you next week. GW Europe's stock markets have closed after a lacklustre day. The FTSE 100 dropping 3 points to 6650, which means it lost 80 points, or 1.1%, in November. As Fast FT reports, this is the third monthly decline this year for the FTSE - which has lagged the other European indices. Over in Athens our correspondent Helena Smith has just spoken to the Greek finance minister himself and can confirm that the upcoming inspection tour by the Troika has not been cancelled - at least officially (see 1.45pm for the rumours). Helena writes: Just caught the Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras in a meeting but ever obliging he agreed to speak for all of a minute and confirm that from the Greek government's perspective, at least, the Troika's visit has not been cancelled. \"We are discussing it with them,\" he told me. \"It's definitely not been cancelled, maybe there will be a postponement for a couple of days but it definitely has not been cancelled,\" Stournaras insisted. Behind the scenes there is much speculation that the threat of a no-show is yet another negotiating ploy to pile the pressure on Greece and finally get it to implement some of its long overdue \"prior actions.\" Inspectors have been alarmed to see that many public sector employees moved into a \"mobility scheme\" as part of efforts to trim the boated public sector have still not seen their salaries reduced to 75 percent of their original paychecks apparently because of resistance from the government's junior socialist partner Pasok, Other prior actions include the closure of Greece's loss-making defence industry and privatisation of the water Board EYDAP. If mission heads do not return it will be the third time in the space of a single review that they have left Athens empty handed. \"We want to avoid that at all costs,\" said another Greek official accepting that tensions between the two were unusually high. \"Right now I can confirm that we are preparing a file to send to our lenders outlining all our positions on all the outstanding issues. They will have it tonight. Don't forget, this is a negotiation.\" The pound has hit its highest level since August 2011. Sterling traded at $1.6383 against the US dollar (the 'Cable' trade), a whisker above the highest level of 2013, set at the start of January. It has been rising in recent days, on predictions that the strenth of the UK economy will prompt the Bank of England to tighten policy earlier that is officially suggesting. Political analyst Alberto Nardelli flags up some opinion poll data from Italy today, showing that public support for Silvio Berlusconi actually rose this week. It's a sign that Berlusconi's political influence could be undimmed by his expulsion from the Senate this week.... He does now lack parliamentary immunity, though, as was shown this morning when an Italian court accused the former prime minister of bribing witnesses to give false testimony in a trial linked to the case in which he has been convicted for paying for sex with a minor. Berlusconi's lawyers, Niccolo Ghedini and Piero Longo, who were also accused of inducing false testimony in the case. They have strongly denied the charges as \"totally disconnected from reality and from the facts\". Black Friday has also turned nasty in Britain, where ASDA (part of WalMart) has introduced the concept today. As my colleague Sarah Butler reports: Shoppers took to the social media site Twitter to describe early morning queues and fights. A woman in Merseyside was reportedly taken to hospital in the morning after being assaulted in a queue outside an Asda store. A man was arrested in Bristol after another fracas. More here, including a dramatic picture of the arrest: Fights break out at Asda as shoppers descend on Black Friday deals Black Friday isn't just about rampant American consumerism. Well, not quite. It's also an opportunity for US workers to protest about their conditions. Thousands of demonstrations are expected at WalMart stores across the country, as the OUR Walmart group pushes the retail giant to commit to paying higher wages to its staff. There are also reports of shoppers trading blows as they battle to grab the best bargains. My US colleagues are tracking all the action here: Black Friday events and protests \u2013 live Over on Wall Street, traders have staggered back to their desks after yesterday's Thanksgiving gorge-a-thon, and found the appetite for a little trading. The Dow Jones index is up 50 points in early trading at 16,147, adding 0.3% to Wednesday's record close. Microsoft is the biggest riser, up 1.2% this morning as American shoppers battle to get their hands on the latest electronics kit in the Black Friday sales. And this year, some UK shops are taking part too. A well-placed Greek finance ministry official who is in daily contact with Yannis Stournaras, the technocrat national economy minister, said there was still \"a possibility\" that international inspectors representing the country's \"troika\" of lenders would visit Greece next week. From Athens, Helena Smith writes: \"I don't care what Reuters is saying\" he said, referring to the agency's report that the visit had been postponed putting a wrench in negotiations being completed before the next euro group meeting on December 9th. \"We never had a concrete date for the visit even when the media was saying the [EU/ECB and IMF] representatives would be back on Monday. \"And we still don't have a date. There is still most definitely a possibility that they will return,\" he said. Regular readers will recall that Stournaras, and pirme minister Antonis Samaras, have both said in recent days that they want negotiations wrapped up by the end of the year before Greece assumes the rotating EU presidency in January. Here's the full story from Reuters: EU and IMF lenders backing Greece have called off a planned visit to Athens next week, a move that may delay the payment of further loans to the country, officials told Reuters on Friday. The visit by the \"troika\"of the the European Central Bank, International Monetary Fund and European Commission was cancelled because Greece has failed to carry out certain reforms promised in its aid programme, the officials said. The inspectors had been due to assess Greece's progress ahead of a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Dec. 9. Asked if the cancelled visit meant it might not be possible to approve the next tranche of aid to Greece, one official responded by email: \"Correct\". A spokesman for the European Commission said discussions with Athens would continue. \"We have not yet taken a decision on precisely when the mission will return,\" he said. Reuters is reporting that officials from Greece's troika of lenders have cancelled plans to return to Athens next week to discuss its bailout programme. RTRS - EU-IMF INSPECTORS HAVE CALLED OFF VISIT TO GREECE PLANNED FOR NEXT WEEK DUE TO ATHENS' FAILURE TO MEET COMMITMENTS - OFFICIALS We're looking into it..... It would mean there's no chance of getting Greece's next aid payment agreed at the upcoming meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Monday 9th December. Bankers continue to cream off too much money for their own senior staff rather than serving the economy, campaigners for a financial transaction tax are claiming. They're alarmed by today's news that the number of bankers earning \u20ac1m or more in Europe jumped by 11% in 2012. Simon Chouffot, spokesperson for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: \"It's outrageous that five scandal-ridden years after causing the biggest crash in a generation bankers are still receiving such bloated rewards. \"These pay packets are more than 32 times the average salary in the UK. If the banks can afford to dole out such excessive sums they can also afford to contribute more for the damage they have caused to society. \"The fact that they are already trying to wriggle out of the incoming bonus cap shows more fundamental change is needed to bring financial sector excess back under control.\" The number of bankers based in the EU who earn at least \u20ac1m per year rose by 11% in 2012. And three quarters of them worked in Britain. A report from the European Banking Authority this morning showed that 3,529 bankers were paid at least \u20ac1m in 2012, with 2,714 based in the UK -- most, presumably, in the City of London and Canary Wharf. The average pay of those 2,714 UK bankers was almost \u20ac2m last year, which critics are likely see as a sign that banking remuneration remains too high. It's a 35% increase on last year (Sky News has more details) Bonuses dwarfed basic pay last year. In the UK, bankers earning at least \u20ac1m received a total of \u20ac1.12bn in fixed pay, and shared another \u20ac4.169bn in variable remuneration. That means bonuses made up 79% of total pay, or were 390% as much as basic pay. That shows that the EU bonus cap -- at 100% of basic salary, or 200% if shareholders agree -- would have a big effect on City pay packets. But would take-home pay fall, or basic pay simply rise? Here's how the UK figures broke down (showing that most top earners were investment bankers, although many asset management and retail bankers did pretty damn well too) The figures are being gathered as part of Brussels' attempt to ensure that bank pay is designed to ensure \"sound and effective management\", and to encourage \"prudent long-term risk taking in the EU banking sector\". The figures underline how much of the EU's financial sector contained in Britain. In German, just 212 bankers received over \u20ac1m, followed by France (177), Italy (109) and Spain (100). Both Greece and Slovakia reported just one seven-figure banker each. The full report is here (pdf). The drop in the overall eurozone jobless rate, and the rise in inflation, suggests the European economy is healing, says Reuters. Here's how it rounds up the news: The first fall in euro zone unemployment in almost three years coupled with rising prices gave fresh momentum to an economic recovery, but a growing rift between the bloc's haves and have-nots continued to widen. The improvement is a welcome sign that the euro zone's rebound is picking up steam, more than five years after a financial crisis erupted that forced five countries from Cyprus to Spain to seek emergency aid from their neighbours. The jobless rate in October fell to 12.%, the first fall since February 2011, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Friday. That was slightly better than the 12.2% that economists forecast but it belies a wide disparity across the 17 countries using the currency. While just 5% of Austrians are unemployed, 27% of Greeks and Spaniards are without a job. In total, 19 million people are out of work. Consumer prices in the euro zone rose by 0.9% in November, higher than the 0.8% forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The annual inflation rate was also up from the 0.7% level in October, a sharp drop from September that surprised policymakers and raised concerns about the threat of deflation.Energy prices fell in November, but the rising pace of food inflation pulled up the overall reading. Still, there are wide divergences across the bloc, with Greece, Cyprus and Ireland suffering deflation in October. Incidentally, the record youth unemployment rate doesn't take into account young people who are economically inactive. It's a measure of those under 25 who are looking for work, compared to the total youth labour force. The raw fact is that 3.577m people aged 15-24 in the eurozone were looking for work in October, 15,000 more than a year ago, out of a youth labour force of over 14 million. Eurostat has more information. The youth unemployment rate in the eurozone has climbed to a new record high. The news takes the shine off the the first drop in the overall eurozone jobless rate for almost three years announced this morning (see earlier post). Eurostat reported that the unemployment rate for those under 25 in the euroarea rose to 24.4% in October, the highest level it has ever reported (the press office confirm). It was 24.3% in September 2013, and 23.7% a year ago. Rates are particularly high in the Southern European countries that have been hit hardest in the eurozone crisis. Spain's youth unemployment rate climbed to 57.4% in October, up from 56.8% in September. Italy's youth unemployment rate rose to 41.2%, from 40.5% the previous month. In Portugal, it rose to 36.5% from 36.2%. New data for Greece wasn't released - but in August its youth unemployment rate was 58%. The picture is hardly better in the wider European Union, where the youth unemployment rate was measured at 23.7% in October. Reuters flags up that this is the first fall in the headline rate of eurozone unemployment since February 2011. This graph shows how unemployment in the eurozone rose to record levels through the crisis and recession, before the small drop in the jobless rate to 12.1% in October. The eurozone unemployment rate has fallen, offering the hope that the region's long jobless crisis could finally be easing. But the rates of youth unemployment remain painfully high, as Europe's lost generation struggle to find work. The unemployment rate in the euro area fell to 12.1%in October, Eurostat reported, down from 12.2% in September. During the month, the number of people unemployed fell by 61,000 in the euro area, to 19.298 million. For the wider EU, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 10.9%. The youth unemployment rate in the European Union was recorded at 23.7% -- a year ago it was 23.3%. Eurostat also rounded up the stark difference in national unemployment rates: Among the Member States, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Austria (4.8%), Germany (5.2%) and Luxembourg (5.9%), and the highest in Greece (27.3% in August 2013) and Spain (26.7%). Compared with a year ago, the unemployment rate increased in half of the Member States and fell in half. And the Netherlands, hit by a downgrade this morning, saw one of the biggest annual rises. Eurostat again: The highest increases were registered in Cyprus (13.2% to 17.0%), Greece (25.5% to 27.3% between August 2012 and August 2013) and the Netherlands (5.5% to 7.0%). The largest decreases were observed in Latvia (14.0% to 11.9% between the third quarters of 2012 and 2013), Ireland (14.5% to 12.6%) and Lithuania (13.0% to 11.1%). More to follow. JUST IN: Inflation in the euro area rose in November. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 0.9% annually this month, an increase on October's 0.7%, which will calm some fears that the region is sliding into deflation. It's still some way from the ECB's target of just below 2%, though. In it's 'flash' estimate (online here) , Eurostat said that across the eurozone in November: Food, alcohol &amp; tobacco prices are up by 1.6% over the last 12 months Energy costs are down by 1.1% Non-energy industrial goods are up by 0.3% Services are up by 1.5%. In the UK, mortgage approval levels have hit their highest level since the financial crisis began. Mortgage approvals rose to 67,701 in October, from 66,891 the previous month. That rather vindicates that Bank of England's decision yesterday to stop letting banks use its Funding for Lending scheme for household loans. Although we're still not close to pre-crisis levels of mortgage approvals: Netherlands finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has said he's disappointed by the loss of the country's AAA rating, and takes S&amp;P's decision \"seriously\". Speaking to CNBC, Dijsselbloem said the Dutch labour market, housing market, and pensions system are \"the main factors holding back our economic recovery\". He pledged to make structural reforms to ensure the recovery \"picks up in strength\". Asked for his ''emotional response\" to the downgrade, Dijsselbloem replied: I don't have an emotional response. I take these ratings seriously because the market takes them seriously. It just confirms the need for us to push forward some of these reforms so that we can get bigger and better growth figures. He added that Fitch and Moody's recently affirmed the Netherlands AAA status, \"and now S&amp;P has downgraded us to AA+\". I'm disappointed by that fact, but I take it seriously because these are serious agencies which are take seriously by the markets. The interview is online here. The president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, has welcomed S&amp;P's decision to upgrade his country's credit rating. He tweets that the upgrade is the result of the \"consistent and decisive policy\" that his government has followed since accepting a \u20ac10bn bailout programme that included tough capital controls - restricting how much money people can take out of the bank. Anastasiades added that the upgrade should held rebuild confidence in Cyprus's economy, and pledged to maintain disciplined and prudent policies to tackle the challenges ahead. The upgrade, from CCC+ to B-, means Cyprus is now four notches away from 'default', but still the sixth-worse junk rating (handy table here) There was a time when a eurozone credit rating downgrade would shake the markets. Not today, though -- stock markets are calm across Europe. The FTSEurofirst 300, which includes the biggest stocks across the region, is flat after hitting a five-year closing high last night. Even the Amsterdam market is calm (up 0.04%) Investors do have good news to digest too -- the upgrade of Cyprus (suggesting less danger of a default), and the raising of Spain's outlook to stable: One of the Netherlands' many problems right now is negative equity after it suffered a nasty housing crash (there's a good feature on the BBC) By last summer, one in four houses were worth less than the mortgages taken out to pay for them. This has left the banks nursing bad loans and prevented people moving house; hurting the economy and slowing its exit from recession. Consumer spending is also sliding -- with retail sales slumping by 6.1% year-on-year in September. A bit more reaction to the Netherlands being downgraded one notch to AA+ (see opening post for the details): S&amp;P's decision to raise Spain's outlook from negative to stable is an encouraging sign, say City analysts: As a member of the eurozone's Northern core, the loss of the AAA rating must sting the Netherlands - (even though they clung on about two years longer than France managed). That core, though, looks rather less healthy than it once did. As Deutsche Bank put it in August: The Netherlands is more akin to a 'peripheral', with dramatically rising unemployment, spiking business failures and economic confidence detaching from the AAA peer group and moving to crisis country levels. (that's via CNBC) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. The Netherlands has lost its AAA credit rating, whittling down the number of eurozone members with a top-notch credit rating to just three, in the latest reminder that the economic problems in the region are not over. S&amp;P downgraded the Dutch credit rating early this morning by one notch to AA+, saying that the country's weak growth prospects were incompatible with the prized triple-A rating But it also upgraded Cyprus, and raised Spain's outlook in recognition of progress made by Madrid. S&amp;P warned that the Dutch economy will have shrank by 1.2% this year (it just clawed its way out of recession), and only sees growth of 0.5% in 2014. We do not anticipate that real economic output will surpass 2008 levels before 2017, and believe that the strong contribution of net exports to growth has not been enough to offset a weak domestic economy The downgrade reflects our opinion that The Netherlands\u2019 growth prospects are now weaker than we had previously anticipated, and the real GDP per capita trend growth rate is persistently lower than that of peers. While credit rating agencies remain discredited in some quarters following their failure to spot the financial crisis bubbling away, the downgrade will still be a blow to the Netherlands' government. It is pushing austerity measures through in the face of weak consumer spending and a house price crash. It means Germany, Luxembourg and Finland are the only countries left with a AAA rating with the 'Big Three agencies. Moody's and Fitch still rate the Netherlands as AAA, but with a negative outlook. S&amp;P upgraded Cyprus, though, from CCC+ to B-. It said that the risk of default has eased since the country slumped into an IMF-led bailout this spring. It said: The stable outlook reflects our view of the implementation risks that remain as the end of the three-year European Commission, International Monetary Fund, and European Central Bank program approaches, balanced against the upside potential we see coming from Cyprus' economy. S&amp;P also has cheerier news for Spain -- it raised its outlook from negative to stable, removing the threat of a downgrade. The agency cited the gradual return of growth to Spain, adding: Other credit metrics are stabilizing, in our view, due to budgetary and structural reforms, coupled with supportive eurozone policies. The effectiveness of those eurozone policies will become clearer through the day, as new unemployment and inflation data is released at 10am GMT. Reaction to follow, along with other developments through the day.",

    "webTitle": "Housing boom lures German builders to leave 'boring Bavaria' for London", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "In an office block in Nuremberg, southern Germany, Bavarian builders and tradespeople are being lectured on the \"vital importance\" of tea breaks to British brickies, the difficulty of interpreting British understatement and how to cope with \"crazy\" UK health and safety laws. This is one of a series of conferences across the country designed to persuade German builders, carpenters, window makers, plumbers and electricians to move to Britain to exploit its \"phenomenal housing boom\". Ewald Gilbert Denzler, export manager for Bayern Handwerk International (the trade association of 853,000 Bavarians), said he decided to hold the conference after reading about the huge shortage of homes in Britain and the Help to Buy and Green Deal schemes introduced by the government to boost construction of energy-efficient housing. \"There is something quite big going on in the UK \u2026 and German builders with their training and expertise are well placed to exploit the opportunity,\" Denzler said, as he headed a series of talks designed to introduce Bavarian builders to the British building industry, including a lecture on \"tea time\" and other cultural differences. Denzler said the movement of highly skilled German workers to Britain was almost a reversal of the 1980s exodus made famous by Jimmy Nail in the TV series Auf Wiedersehen Pet. \"In the past there was a good number of UK companies on construction sites in Germany. Now it is the other way round,\" he said. Denzler said enquiries from tradesmen wanting to move into the British market had more than doubled compared with five years ago, but there are no official records of the number of German building workers or companies that have moved to Britain. He said trade organisations in northern Germany had reported even greater interest in moving to the UK owing to their closer proximity: \"Down here in Bavaria it's a much longer journey \u2026 10 hours by car, and Ryanair don't let you carry tools.\" German building firms are particularly attracted by the Green Deal initiative, which the UK government describes as \"the most ambitious home improvement programme since the second world war\". The scheme allows households to pay for energy efficiency improvements with no upfront cost. Rainer Wolf, chief executive of Handwerkskammer f\u00fcr Mittelfranken, the chamber of commerce for skilled crafts in Middle Franconia (Nuremberg and the surrounding area), said: \"We are one step ahead of the UK on the road to green energy. Germany plans to make all buildings carbon neutral by 2050. We have more experience, and exporting our energy efficiency experience is going to become big business for Germany. \"Great Britain is a big future market for our companies,\" he added. Most of the firms at the Nuremberg conference are \"Mittlestand\" (small- and medium-sized enterprises) firms focusing on energy efficient construction. Joachim Russ is sales manager of Haga, a 400-employee facades and windows company based in Nuremberg. He said: \"We have a lot of competition in Germany for energy efficient construction; there is less competition in the UK and we could make a lot of money.\" Russ added that Britain had a \"very long way to go\" to catch up with German window technology. There, \"triple glazing is the most common and no one would think about having single glazing like so many British homes\". Windows are close to the heart of many in southern Germany, where daytime winter temperatures hit 3C at best and often fall into double-digit negatives. When asked what defined Germany for her, Chancellor Angela Merkel replied: \"Airtight windows. No other country can build such airtight and beautiful windows.\" Roman Zubiks, a technical draftsman at window company Schindler Roding, has already worked on a project in London's St James's Park. He said he wanted his company to employ a permanent team in London because \"it's much more fun than Bavaria\" and will save money spent on hiring local contractors. Margit Kachler, head of exports for the underfloor heating company IVT, said she was \"really excited\" about the energy efficiency subsidies on offer, which could be \"really good for us\". But she's not keen to head a UK outpost as \"London is far too expensive\". Markus Seifermann, a German architect working in London who lectured the group on the differences between working in Germany and the UK, said Britain was attractive because \"obviously at the moment there is a big opportunity\". And, he added: \"The atmosphere is a lot more friendly and more relaxed\". Seifermann, whose company UberRaum was commissioned to refurbish the German embassy in Belgrave Square, said one of the biggest challenges for Germans in Britain was understanding British understatement. \"Brits say there is 'a little bit of an issue' here, which the Germans may take literally when it's actually a big problem.\" The initiative to encourage Germany's craftsmen, who study for at least five years to gain master craftsman certification, is supported by Rudolf Adam, acting German ambassador to London, who has privately complained of the difficulty of finding highly skilled tradespeople in London. \"More co-operation between British and German craftsmen is welcome. Building closer ties between young skilled workers would be of benefit to both our countries,\" he said. Adam is also understood to be keen to encourage British tradespeople to study for German master craftsman qualifications. The German Confederation of Skilled Crafts has previously trained Chinese workers in the latest automotive electronics and is considering similar schemes with Britain and other European Union countries. \"We had a project with China, where Chinese students were trained at university and in the workplace for a year and then went back to China,\" Wolf said. \"That was like a guarantee to never be unemployed and get very well paid for the rest of your life in China because you've got this German degree.\" Wolf said Britons could sign up for a similar scheme \u2013 but they would have to learn German first.",

But she's not keen to head a UK outpost as \"London is far too expensive\".</p> <p>Markus Seifermann, a German architect working in London who lectured the group on the differences between working in Germany and the UK, said Britain was attractive because \"obviously at the moment there is a big opportunity\". And, he added: \"The atmosphere is a lot more friendly and more relaxed\".</p> <p>Seifermann, whose company UberRaum was commissioned to refurbish the German embassy in Belgrave Square, said one of the biggest challenges for Germans in Britain was understanding British understatement. \"Brits say there is 'a little bit of an issue' here, which the Germans may take literally when it's actually a big problem.\"</p> <p>The initiative to encourage Germany's craftsmen, who study for at least five years to gain master craftsman certification, is supported by Rudolf Adam, acting German ambassador to London, who has privately complained of the difficulty of finding highly skilled tradespeople in London. \"More co-operation between British and German craftsmen is welcome. Building closer ties between young skilled workers would be of benefit to both our countries,\" he said.</p> <p>Adam is also understood to be keen to encourage British tradespeople to study for German master craftsman qualifications. The German Confederation of Skilled Crafts has previously trained Chinese workers in the latest automotive electronics and is considering similar schemes with Britain and other European Union countries.</p> <p>\"We had a project with China, where Chinese students were trained at university and in the workplace for a year and then went back to China,\" Wolf said. \"That was like a guarantee to never be unemployed and get very well paid for the rest of your life in China because you've got this German degree.\"</p> <p>Wolf said Britons could sign up for a similar scheme \u2013 but they would have to learn German first.</p>",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Eurozone youth unemployment reaches record high of 24.4%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The crisis facing the younger generation across the Eurozone worsened last month as youth unemployment hit a new record high of 24.4% with under-25s in Spain, Italy and Portugal finding it harder to get jobs. The grim news on on employment came as the Netherlands was stripped of its prized AAA credit rating despite the country's recent exit from a year-long recession. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's said on Friday that weakening growth prospects showed the country would struggle to improve its financial stability and generate new jobs. It said: \"The downgrade reflects our opinion that the Netherlands' growth prospects are now weaker than we had previously anticipated, and the real GDP per capita trend growth rate is persistently lower than that of peers.\" It cited weakening consumer demand, high levels of personal debt and falling house prices for keeping consumer spending and tax receipts low in the next few years. One in four Dutch homebuyers is in negative equity as a result of falling property values. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, said S&amp;P's downgrade to AA+ was disappointing when the economy had returned to growth. S&amp;P's action leaves only three members of the eurozone with a top rating from all three agencies \u2013 Germany, Luxembourg and Finland. The Eurozone jobless data showed Spain's youth unemployment rate has now increased to 57.4%, only marginally below Greece's August high of 58% - which remains the highest rate of youth unemployment for any country in the eurozone's history. Italy's youth unemployment rate rose to 41.2%, from 40.5% the previous month. In Portugal, it rose to 36.5% from 36.2%. The startling figures from southern Europe contrast with rates in the north where Germany has a 7.8% youth unemployment rate and the Netherlands an 11.6% rate. Italy's credit rating is perilously close to entering junk status and Rome is lobbying hard in Brussels for more time to cut the country's annual deficit. The coalition government headed by Enrico Letta said on Friday it would call a fresh confidence vote in parliament, despite winning a vote earlier in the week, to confirm his government's majority after the withdrawal of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party from the ruling coalition. Letta said the vote would be held after his centre-left Democratic party elects a new leader on 8 December, and would be based on a new agenda for 2014 which would be discussed with coalition partners. \"The confidence vote will allow us to pass from defence into attack,\" said Letta, whose government is backed by the Democratic party, a centrist group Civic Choice and a centre-right group that broke away from Forza Italia. Considering the chaos in Italian politics and the credit rating downgrades affecting some of the EU's traditional paymasters, France and the Netherlands in particular, there are still many analysts who fear for the eurozone's growth prospects over the next decade. Youth unemployment also remains a scar that shows little sign of healing. While the adult unemployment rate fell across the eurozone from 12.2 to 12.1%, 3.6m under-25s are now unemployed, an increase of 15,000 on the previous month.",

One in four Dutch homebuyers is in negative equity as a result of falling property values.</p> <p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, said S&amp;P's downgrade to AA+ was disappointing when the economy had returned to growth.</p> <p>S&amp;P's action leaves only three members of the eurozone with a top rating from all three agencies \u2013 Germany, Luxembourg and Finland.</p> <p>The Eurozone jobless data showed Spain's youth unemployment rate has now increased to 57.4%, only marginally below Greece's August high of 58% - which remains the highest rate of youth unemployment for any country in the eurozone's history. Italy's youth unemployment rate rose to 41.2%, from 40.5% the previous month. In Portugal, it rose to 36.5% from 36.2%.</p> <p>The startling figures from southern Europe contrast with rates in the north where Germany has a 7.8% youth unemployment rate and the Netherlands an 11.6% rate.</p> <p>Italy's credit rating is perilously close to entering junk status and Rome is lobbying hard in Brussels for more time to cut the country's annual deficit. The coalition government headed by Enrico Letta said on Friday it would call a fresh confidence vote in parliament, despite winning a vote earlier in the week, to confirm his government's majority after the withdrawal of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party from the ruling coalition.</p> <p>Letta said the vote would be held after his centre-left Democratic party elects a new leader on 8 December, and would be based on a new agenda for 2014 which would be discussed with coalition partners.</p> <p>\"The confidence vote will allow us to pass from defence into attack,\" said Letta, whose government is backed by the Democratic party, a centrist group Civic Choice and a centre-right group that broke away from Forza Italia.</p> <p>Considering the chaos in Italian politics and the credit rating downgrades affecting some of the EU's traditional paymasters, France and the Netherlands in particular, there are still many analysts who fear for the eurozone's growth prospects over the next decade.</p> <p>Youth unemployment also remains a scar that shows little sign of healing. While the adult unemployment rate fell across the eurozone from 12.2 to 12.1%, 3.6m under-25s are now unemployed, an increase of 15,000 on the previous month.</p>",

Wright told MPs he understood why people were \"angry and frustrated\" about rising energy bills, but said the regulator was doing everything it could within its statutory powers. \"Consumers have a perception that the market is not working well and that's something that we agree with. We think the retail market is not working as well as it should do.\" He rejected the idea he was supportive of the rises, or energy company profits in a week when an Ofgem report showed that profits per customer rose 77% to \u00a353 from \u00a335. Wright had been director of Ofgem's markets division since 2008, before stepping up as acting chief executive in June. He spent more than decade in the City in energy analyst roles at UBS and Merrill Lynch, and worked in the industry during privatisation in the 1990s. Wright replaced Alistair Buchanan, who announced he was standing down last December after 10 years at the helm of the regulator. Buchanan has since gone on to a lucrative role at consultancy firm KPMG's power and utilities arm. The Ofgem chief executive role has been advertised: a spokesman said the recruitment process was ongoing without specifying when the vacancy would be filled.",
