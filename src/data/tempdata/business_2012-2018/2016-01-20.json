      "bodyText": "Fears that the global economy could be heading for a repeat of the 2008 financial crash have sent shockwaves through financial markets \u2013 prompting a rush to safe havens by investors. Oil prices fell to a fresh 12-year low on Wednesday and metal prices tumbled in response to warnings that China\u2019s slowdown could derail the global recovery at a time when central banks, which came to the rescue in the credit crunch, have only limited firepower. As world and business leaders gathered for the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the FTSE 100 was gripped by panic selling, especially of mining and oil companies that have been hit hard by the global slowdown in manufacturing and trade. Earlier this week, China recorded the slowest rate of economic growth for 25 years. The index dropped more than 200 points to finish the day down more than 20% from its peak of 7,122, reached in April last year. Such a 20% decline marks the beginning of a bear market. In New York, shares on the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 249 points down (1.56%), recovering from a 550-point-drop earlier in the day, while Brent crude dropped to $27.78 a barrel \u2013 down by about 70% from its summer 2014 level of $115 a barrel. Stock markets in Russia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia also dived as concerns mounted that countries already badly hit by the fall in oil prices could be forced to dip further into reserves to prevent an economic crisis. Global equities have had their worst start to a year on record. William White, a former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers\u2019 club, who now chairs the OECD\u2019s review committee warned that central bankers had \u201cused up all their ammunition\u201d. \u201cThe situation is worse than it was in 2007. Our macroeconomic ammunition to fight downturns is essentially all used up. Debts have continued to build up over the past eight years and they have reached such levels in every part of the world that they have become a potent cause for mischief,\u201d he said on the eve of the event. The BIS was one of the few organisations to warn during 2006 and 2007 about the unstable levels of bank lending that eventually led to the Lehman Brothers crash. Concerns that the global recovery could be derailed began last summer when a devaluation of the Chinese currency caused a meltdown on the Shanghai stock exchange. A series of economic downgrades to the Chinese and US economies since then, coupled with a rise in US interest rates, have fuelled investors\u2019 misgivings about optimistic forecasts for a recovery in economic fortunes. Adding to the concerns of a sharp downgrade in global growth this year, a survey for the consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers before the Davos meeting revealed that two-thirds of chief executives saw more threats facing their businesses than three years ago. And the head of the Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, turned the screw by warning that the world was stuck in an era of low growth. Last week, an investment analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland advised clients to \u201csell everything\u201d except the safest high grade bonds after warning of a \u201ccataclysmic\u201d year and the strong likelihood of a stock market crash. His comments came after the British chancellor, George Osborne, warned in a new year speech of a \u201ccocktail of threats\u201d to the UK\u2019s prospects from an increasingly uncertain world economy. Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist at consultancy IHS, blamed the Chinese authorities for triggering the global panic. \u201cThe big event that I think has captured everyone\u2019s attention is the developments in China and in particular the fact that growth is slowing,\u201d he said. The Chinese policymakers had fumbled, he said. \u201cThey have made some mistakes. And they have added to the uncertainty and the volatility by their behaviour.\u201d Others blamed the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, for raising interest rates in December to 0.5% when growth was already faltering, increasing borrowing costs to US businesses and encouraging an influx of funds, especially from China. However, Nouriel Roubini, who was even more vocal than the BIS in warning of the 2008 crash, said that the threat of a crash was overplayed: \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d But 2016 was going to be a bumpy year until central banks responded with extra stimulus, he warned, saying: \u201cThe big thing that should happen is [that] China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms.\u201d Pierre Moscovici, the European economics commissioner, said central banks retained some firepower to prevent another crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that the financial crisis is coming back. We don\u2019t feel that we are facing the risk of a breakdown in world growth, but there are downsides that we need to address,\u201d he said. Maurice Obstfeld, the chief economist at the IMF, said he was concerned that central banks were held back by concerns that an extra stimulus would cause more inflation in a couple of years. \u201cCentral banks should be more relaxed about overshooting their inflation targets and more concerned about deflationary pressures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in an environment where there is growing concern that inflation expectations are not firmly anchored. So there should be much more concern about deflation.\u201d Among the biggest losers on the FTSE 100 were international mining groups, whose business has been particularly hit by the slowdown in China as demand for industrial basics such as iron ore and copper has fallen rapidly. The biggest loser was miner and commodities trading group Glencore, whose shares tumbled nearly 10% to 71p. Less than two years ago, they were changing hands at 375p. Anglo American, the iron ore, copper and diamond miner, lost more than 7%, falling to 221p. Less than four years ago, they were valued at more than \u00a334.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s drama: And that\u2019s all for tonight. Back tomorrow. GW Phew! Today\u2019s stock market rout is over, with Wall Street posting chunky losses - but not as bad as it looked earlier. The Dow Jones closed 245 points, or 1.5%, in the red - bad, but better than the 500+ slump that had Davos attendees gasping earlier today. As if today wasn\u2019t dramatic enough - Deutsche Bank has issued a profit warning: In another significant move, Joe Biden has used his trip to Davos to urge executives to fight for the right of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Reuters has got the story: The issue is on the official agenda for the first time at the World Economic Forum, where political leaders from countries that discriminate against gay people, such as Nigeria and Russia, schmooze business leaders and billionaire investors. Biden told U.S. executives including Nathan Blecharczyk, co-founder of apartment-sharing firm Airbnb, Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca Cola Company, and Anthony Scaramucci, founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital, to push for change. \u201cYou can change the terms of debate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou actually put governments on notice.\u201d He said he and President Barack Obama privately raise the issue of repression of the LGBT community when they meet political leaders. \u201cI have had some run-ins with at least four heads of state already on this,\u201d said Biden More here: Biden urges U.S. business in Davos to lean on anti-gay states Joe Biden is giving quite a progressive speech tonight at Davos. He\u2019s telling the heads of the world\u2019s biggest businesses that they need to ensure basic protection for workers are the world economy embraces the 4th industrial revolution. Joe Biden also cited one of the statistics of the week - the continued concentration of wealth among the very richest. Joe Biden, the vice-president of the United States, has given the final keynote speech of the day. He started by joking with Christine Lagarde in the audience, saying that he might need some money. Not for a bailout deal (things aren\u2019t that bad today!), but for his own purposes: Whenever I see you, Christine, you say \u201cI know, Greece. I know, Ukraine\u201d. But this time I need a personal loan. But then he turns to the issue of the 4th industrial revolution. It is creating new jobs, and even creating new industries. But will it actually transform the global economy? And will it be for better, or worse? Those who think we must get used to the new normal of slower growth are mistaken, Biden says. Technology is improving productivity, and it can create employment - he cites ride-sharing companies are taking on more staff. And \u201castounding\u201d breakthroughs in science will save lives. But there are dangers, and we must be pro-active. Biden says: How will the warehouse worker who used to ship your order, or the salesman who used to take it, make a living when they are no longer needed? And he goes on to warn that the old relationship between work and wages has been broken, and employees aren\u2019t getting a fair deal: \u201cThe Dow Jones industrial average is down over 500 points\u201d, whispers one Davos attendee. And they\u2019re right. The Dow has shed 536 points, or 3.3%, right now to leave it at 15,475 points. Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, just whisked through the Davos conference room with a hall entourage. He wasn\u2019t taking press questions, alas, but did share a quick, friendly handshake with Finland\u2019s finance minister, Alex Stubb. I guess relations are warmer than last year, during the months of debt negotiations. Tsipras is meeting with several top officials during his visit, including Christine Lagarde of the IMF. He\u2019s hoping to make persuade them that Athens is making progress, and should be given some leeway on austerity and debt relief. But there is concern that the IMF will take a tough line on pension reform, threatening to reignite the debt crisis again.... US oil prices crashed below $27 for the first time since 2003 after the International Energy Agency warned on Tuesday that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Venezuela requested an emergency Opec meeting to discuss steps to shore up oil prices, but other delegates dismissed the idea. New York light crude tumbled 5.5% to $26.89 a barrel on Wednesday, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost 4.2% to $27.56. Plunging oil prices piled further pressure on global stock markets. London\u2019s leading index, the FTSE 100, slid 203.22 points, or 3.5%, to 5673.58. Germany\u2019s Dax tumbled 272.57 points, or 2.8%, to 9391.64 and France\u2019s CAC lost 147.31 points, or 3.5%, to 4124.95. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has plunged more than 400 points to 15,62.42, a 2.6% drop. The Nasdaq shed 115 points to 4361.53, also a 2.6% fall. Back to Davos, and the Pope has sent a message to politicians and business leaders attending WEF - don\u2019t forget the poorest in society. Pope Francis warned that \u201csoulless machines\u201d should not be allowed to muscle humans out of work, saying: \u201cTo all of you I appeal once more: \u2018Do not forget the poor!\u2019 He continued: Weeping for other people\u2019s pain does not only mean sharing in their sufferings, but also and above all realising that our own actions are a cause of injustice and inequality. Once we realise this, we become more fully human, since responsibility for our brothers and sisters is an essential part of our common humanity. Do not be afraid to open your minds and hearts to the poor. In this way, you will give free rein to your economic and technical talents, and discover the happiness of a full life, which consumerism of itself cannot provide.\u201d Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, has summed up the action on financial markets: FTSE bears have been enjoying themselves today, as the index touches levels not seen since late 2012. The UK market has not been alone, as Europe and now the US join in with the panic of January 2016. Bond yields are heading lower too as investors shun risky assets and stash their money in any safe place going. The main driver of the falls continues to be oil, which has pushed onwards to fresh lows, taking oil stocks with it. A fresh downgrade to IMF growth forecasts underlines what stock markets are telling investors \u2013 that things are looking gloomy across the board.\u201d While we were quizzing Ken Rogoff, Adam Posen, et al, Iranian officials have been taking a pop at Saudi Arabia. Foreign minister Javad Zarif argued that the Saudi\u2019s are to blame for the crisis in the Middle East. The Telegraph has the details. Zarif claimed that: \u201cSaudi Arabia has tried to keep the old staus quo in our region because they don\u2019t think change is in their interest. They unnecessarily panicked and created a lot of mess in our region. And Mohammad Agha Nahavandian, the chief of staff to Iranian prime minister Rouhani, has apparently said Iran will \u2018certainly\u2019 raise oil exports to the levels before sanctions were imposed (they were lifted last week, of course). That\u2019s likely to further inflame tensions within Opec, and keep pressure on the oil price. The sell-off in global market is gathering pace. The Dow Jones is now down more than 400 points, or 2.6%, at 15,593.72. The FTSE 100 index in London has tumbled nearly 230 points, or 3.9%, to 5649.55. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 335 points, or 3.5%, falling to 9329.09, while France\u2019s CAC is down nearly 180 points to 4087.42, a 4.2% fall. Spot US crude oil futures have dropped below $27 a barrel, the lowest since September 2003, following a warning from the world\u2019s energy watchdog that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Adam Posen, the Peterson Institute director who used to set UK interest rates, has also discussed the crisis with us. He\u2019s not desperately alarmed: \u201cI don\u2019t think we are on the edge of another financial crisis. I don\u2019t even think we are on the edge of another crash. The idea that things are as over-valued as they were last time is false.\u201d Posen said governments should be taking advantage of low interest rates to improve public infrastructure, called on China to boost the economy by creating a social safety net and said central banks should avoid making mistakes. \u201cAt the margin I am not sure the Federal Reserve did the right thing by raising rates last month but I am not sure it was a big mistake. But if the Bank of England or the ECB raised rates, that would be a big mistake.\u201d We\u2019ve now grabbed some time with Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and now economics professor at Harvard, to discuss the market turmoil, and the global economy. Rogoff reckons the problems were concentrated in emerging markets. Asked whether the world was on the edge of another crisis, Rogoff said: \u201cIt feels to me that there is a panic in the markets that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into the real economy.\u201d Rogoff said that emerging markets would suffer in 2016, but that the US and Europe were \u201csolid\u201d. He added: \u201cIf China goes from 7% growth to minus 2% growth then everybody will be in recession. If it goes to 3-4% growth it will probably not be enough to cause a recession in the developed world. But it is definitely a very precarious situation for emerging markets.\u201d Rogoff said it would help if Chinese policy makers won back the credibility they had lost by their \u201cfoolish\u201d attempts trying to control the stock market and the exchange rate. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to control the weather. They should let the exchange rate and the stock market find their own level. This is the third leg of the debt super-cycle. First is was the US, then it was Europe, now it is China.\u201d Bob Diamond\u2019s concerns about liquidity (see earlier post) have also been echoed by a top IMF official earlier today: Speaking on a panel, deputy director Min Zhu said: \u201cThe key issue is that liquidity could drop dramatically, and that scares everyone.\u201d \u201cIf everybody is moving together we don\u2019t have any liquidity at all. We have to be ready to act very fast.\u201d Hat-tip to AEP... Canada\u2019s new prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has urged Davos attendees to invest more in his country, in one of his first appearances on the international stage since winning power. Trudeau jokes that while Davos is lovely, business leaders should really check out Whistler (the Canadian ski resort). And on the big issue of WEF, the rise of the robots, Trudeau warns that technology needs to serve the cause of human progress, and growth only succeeds if everyone benefits from it. He also argues that Canada can ride out the oil price slump: We\u2019ve also collared Dennis Nally, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, to talk about the turmoil in the markets. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we are heading for another crash but unquestionably the environment is clearly having an effect on markets, on everything that is going on here and on the attitudes that exist here in Davos. Confidence levels are down, the volatility we are seeing, There are more threats today than ever. How bad could it get? Who knows. Some people are speculating oil could reach $10 a barrel. I don\u2019t think any of us know. All of this uncertainty has a direct impact on confidence levels\u201d. What should be done? \u201cThere needs to be more dialogue about how [bring] to stability back into the system. I believe there is a disconnect between government, regulators and business\u201d. Bob Diamond, the banker who was forced out of Barclays during the Libor rigging crisis, says there\u2019s no comparison between the situation today and in 2008. Diamond, who has now founded a banking operation called Altas Mara which is expanding across Africa, says: \u201cIt Is a correction, a heathy correction. A lot of people are trying to compare it to 2008, but during the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 we probably had the deepest economic correction I have seen. I don\u2019t see us going into that position. The US economy is still strong, Europe is doing surprising well - the easier monetary policy led by governor [of the European Central Bank Mario] Draghi has sown some positives. There is a correction in China.. If china slows down to 6 or 7% (growth) is that a success? That\u2019s fine\u201d He also suggests that new regulations brought in since 2008 aren\u2019t helping to calm the markets: \u201cA lot of people are taking about where is the liquidity, where are the buyers? Basel three, Volcker rule, ring fenced banks, buffer upon buffer of capital. Are we surprised there is less liquidity from the banks?\u201d Here\u2019s one jot of good news, Nouriel Roubini, Davos\u2019s own doctor doom and the economist who predicted the last crash doesn\u2019t think it is going to be that bad this time. \u201cIt is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.\u201d But 2016 is going to be a bumpy year until central banks respond, Roubini warns. \u201dThe big thing that should happen is China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms\u201d. Roubini is also concerned about the impact of smarter technology: To no one\u2019s great surprise, the US markets have followed the rest of the world and moved sharply lower in early trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 271 points or 1.7% while the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 1% and Nasdaq has lost 1.5%. Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems, said: I think we\u2019re witnessing a collision of events which has provoked an immediate sense of crisis. Whether it\u2019s commodities, China, oil prices, terrorism, geopolitical turbulence, all have landed particularly in the month of January and there is an immediate impact which is reflected in the stock market. At the moment what is being discounted are some of the positives that come out of low oil prices in economic terms. It is only being looked at in the lens of bad news. It is too early to say whether this is a crisis of lasting proportion but I think we should certainly continue to focus on addressing the challenges that are there for all. China may have slowed down but it\u2019s not stopped. Europe is fragile but is focused on improvement and with the UK\u2019s engagement in encouraging a more competitive Europe. America still has the fundamentals of an entrepreneurial spirit, self sufficiency in energy. When you look to the positive, while things are far from perfect, we are not at the point of absolute crisis. Back in Davos and Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT, was asked if we were on the brink of another crisis. He replied: On the balance of probabilities no, but it is very finely balanced. It is an unstable environment. In terms of doing business, I\u2019ve just been at a lunch and most of the CEOs there say most of the underlying businesses are pretty good. If there is contagion in financial markets into the business markets that is going to affect confidence and that\u2019s when we could see a slow down. How bad? We\u2019ve got to be used to a period of time when the world is just more volatile and we have to be able to live and manage through those sort of conditions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away. There could be quite significant swings but the underlying number when it\u2019s evened out will be fine. What can be done? We need the financial markets to settle down and hope that confidence remains strong and that it doesn\u2019t affect people\u2019s underlying desire to do business. What is really going in China is a big [concern], elections and referendum around the world is an issue and the state of things in the Middle East which have a knock on effect. The US inflation figures suggest there may only be one Federal Reserve rate rise this year, says Rob Carnell of ING Bank: US CPI for December fell 0.1% month on month versus a consensus 0.0% month on month expectation. Energy prices were down 2.4% month on month, and food prices also fell for a second consecutive month. But it is the weakness in the service sector inflation component that probably caught the consensus out the most. At only +0.1% month on month, this was down on the trend 0.2-0.3% growth in service sector prices over recent months, and may reflect a slightly weaker growth profile in residential rents, though it has to be said that the weakness in services was not confined to rentals, and was reflected also in areas such as recreation and education. Goods (commodities prices) were as ever, very weak (down 0.1% month on month excluding food and energy, down 2.1% year on year). At this stage, with the market looking for no further Fed rate hikes until the second half of 2016, and only one rate hike in total this year, it is our own forecasts with two further rate hikes, one in June, and another in the fourth quarter of 2016, that look more in need of amendment than the market view. The Fed dot diagram suggestion for four further hikes this year looks utterly out of touch with reality, if anyone was still paying any attention to this. In the US, the consumer price index fell 0.1% month on month in December after being unchanged the previous month. Analysts had been expected the index to also remain flat in December, but the falling oil price helped push it lower. But the year on year figure rose 0.7%, following a 0.5% gain in November. The core CPI, which strips out energy and food costs, rose 0.1% month on month after rising 0.2% for the previous three months, and 2.1% year on year. Meanwhile US housing starts fell 2.5% in December, adding to worries about the strength of the US economy. Goldman Sachs has reported a drop in profits for the fourth straight quarter, hit by a $5bn settlement related to sales of mortgage bonds during the financial crisis. The bank\u2019s fourth quarter earnings fell 71.8% to $574m, with its results also affected by the plunge in oil prices, the slowdown in the Chinese economy and US rate rises. The slump in oil prices has sent the rouble to a new record low. The Russian currency fell to 80.92 to the dollar before recovering to 80.85, still down 2.8% on the day. The fall comes amid fears that the commodity-dependent Russian economy could be further hit by the continuing slide in crude prices. London\u2019s leading index has fallen into bear market territory, defined as 20% below its recent peak. The FTSE 100 has fallen to 5688, down more than 3% as the oil price continues to slide amid concerns about oversupply and lack of demand. Worries about the outlook for China have rattled global markets, not helped by gloomy comments from the World Economic Forum in Davos. The leading index has now fallen more than 20% from its intra-day peak of 7122, reached in April last year. Meanwhile Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.9% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 3.4%. Brent crude is currently 2.7% lower at $27.98 a barrel. Just grabbed a word with Philip J. Jennings, general secretary of UNI Global Union, about the turmoil in the markets. Are we heading into a crash? Yes, we are heading for a crash, I\u2019m worried about it. Emerging markets were meant to pull us through this crisis. but China is slowing, and the impact will ripple out across the developing economy. And the jobs situation across the global economy will not improve How bad could it get? We are worried abut the economic climate - how deep the crash will be. Those RBS analysts [who said to sell everything] may be right - \u201ccataclysm\u201d could be the right word to use. What should be done? We need leadership. The G20 needs to fulfil the promise they made at the last financial crisis, to not just save the banking sector but to also put the economy back on track. The private sector need to understand that lack of investment isn\u2019t helping, and we need to push wages higher. The G20 needs to put demand back in the economy. Some customers at Italy\u2019s Monte dei Paschi bank have started withdrawing their savings, according to its chief executive. The bank is struggling with its bad loans and has seen its stock market value have this year. Reuters reports: Chief executive Fabrizio Viola did not say how much money savers had withdrawn, or when the outflow began, though he said the fall in deposits was \u201climited\u201d and that the bank could cope with it as he sought to reassure customers and investors. Italian bank shares have lost 20% so far this year as investors, already rattled about global economic growth, have sold out of a sector with low profitability and about 200 billion euros ($218 billion) of loans that are unlikely to be repaid. Monte Paschi - Italy\u2019s third-biggest bank - has lost the most ground as it is perceived to be the most vulnerable; it has the highest level of bad loans as a proportion of assets and was the worst performer in a health check of eurozone lenders in 2014. The Tuscan-based bank\u2019s stock, which had plunged 15% on Monday and 14.4% on Tuesday, was suspended from trading several times after falling 18.2% on Wednesday. The plunge helped dragged down all other Italian banking stocks, with Carige shedding 12.7% and Banco Popolare falling more than 6%. Viola said the plunge in Monte Paschi shares was not a reflection of the bank\u2019s fundamentals, which he said had improved in the last quarter of 2015. \u201cOf course clients turning to our local branches are worried about what they read,\u201d Viola said in a statement. \u201cAt present the size of the funding lost due to clients who decided to move part of their savings elsewhere is limited and anyway below levels seen during the previous crisis the bank faced in February 2013 which was overcome brilliantly.\u201d The 2013 crisis he was referring to was when the world\u2019s oldest bank, already badly weakened by the euro zone debt crisis, was hit by a scandal about loss-making derivatives trades... \u201cOver the past few days many have been wondering about the pace at which people closed their accounts and sold bank bonds,\u201d said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a bank run but there are definitely outflows,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, there are reports of Italian government meetings to discuss the problems in the country\u2019s banking sector: Here\u2019s some words of comfort amid the gloom. European economics commissioner Pierre Moscovici does not believe there will be a repeat of the financial crisis, nor does he think the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook will be changed in the next EC forecasts. And he says central banks still have actions they can take to tackle any further slowdown, even if interest rates are at record lows and plenty of stimulus measures have already been taken. Reuters reports from an interview with Moscovici: Central banks still have more firepower they can use to counter a slowdown in global growth, which does not change the outlook for recovery in the eurozone, European Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said on Wednesday. In an interview with Reuters Television at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Moscovici said he did not believe there would be any return to an international financial crisis, despite turmoil in world markets during the first few weeks of 2016 triggered by China\u2019s slowdown and low oil prices. Asked whether the world\u2019s main central banks had run out of ammunition to revive the global economy after years of record low interest rates and quantitative easing, he said: \u201cThey have got guns and they can act.\u201d Moscovici said he did not expect any major change in the euro zone\u2019s growth outlook when the European Commission issues an updated forecast in early February, despite the sharp slowdown in China and tumbling stock and commodity markets. The EU executive last forecast in November that the euro zone would grow by 1.8 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2017 after an estimated 1.6 percent last year. \u201cAs I see it today I see no change, no major change in our forecast... for Europe. But of course we\u2019ve got to take into account those downside risks. We don\u2019t need to change our policy stance but to reinforce it,\u201d he said. On global market turbulence and falling commodity prices, Moscovici said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel that the financial crisis is coming back. We don\u2019t feel that we are facing the risk of a breakdown in world growth, but there are downsides that we need to address. The IMF has also weighed in on migration, saying it can be positive. A new report predicts a short-term boot to GDP in countries who take refugees in, and long-term benefits if migrants are integrated well. IMF chief Christine Lagarde has also tried to crush worries that migrants will drive wages down: More on capital flows. The amount of money flowing out of emerging markets, especially China, was much worse than expected last year, according to a report from the Institute of International Finance. In October the finance industry group forecast net outflows from emerging markets of $540bn. Now it says the figure was $735bn, with $676bn from China, as investors pulled out of emerging markets and Chinese companies hurried to pay off overseas loans as the country\u2019s currency depreciated. The institute said: Net capital outflows from emerging markets in 2015 were even larger than we previously thought. We now estimate total net capital outflows (including unrecorded flows captured by net errors and omissions) at $735 billion, up from outflows of $111 billion in 2014. The bulk of these outflows relate to China, driven in part by repayment of corporate foreign currency liabilities in the face of concerns about a weakening currency. We estimate total capital outflows from China amounted to $676 billion in 2015\u2014including $216 billion in unrecorded outflows in errors and omissions. Other emerging markets also experienced net capital outflows, as non-resident inflows slumped on broader concerns about emerging market growth performance and corporate indebtedness. For 2016, we expect continued net capital outflows albeit at a somewhat more moderate pace. The impact of the Fed\u2019s shift to a tightening cycle may be limited as long as it is gradual, but flows to emerging markets will continue to face headwinds from growth and debt concerns. HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver spoke to reporters after he had finished talking about climate change. Asked about the financial market turmoil, he said that part of the movement was \u201cself fulfilling\u201d as investors liquidated positions to make margin calls on positions. \u201cYou always get an overshoot in times of significant sell offs\u201d. He also warned there could be more sell-offs. \u201cI think we will see further adjustments before we hit equilibrium. We\u2019ll see a little more sell offs before we see equilibrium but we\u2019re closer equilibrium than we were a couple of weeks ago, we\u2019re towards the end of this sort of sell off\u201d. He indicated that growth in China was strong and that yesterday\u2019s figures were 30% of the entire Chinese economy in 2005. The bank is currently deciding whether to keep its headquarters in the UK. Gullliver said an update would be made by the time of the results of February 22. Nariman Behravesh, chief economist of IHS, has some interesting thoughts on China, where he thinks policy makers in Beijing will respond to pressure on the yuan by quietly bringing back capital controls. \u201cThere has been a massive amount of capital flight - around $1 trillion since last summer\u201d Behravesh said. \u201cThat puts huge downward pressure on the exchange rate. The question is what happens next.\u201d \u201cThe first thing that policy makers could do is to let the currency go. That would result in a devaluation of 15-20%. That would have horrible consequences. It could trigger a global currency war and a global recession.\u201d The second thing they could do is keep using foreign currency reserves, but there are limits to that.\u201d Finally, either explicitly or implicitly, they could bring back capital controls\u201d. Behravesh said the third approach would run counter to the reform agenda of China\u2019s leaders, who have expressed a desire for greater financial liberalisation. \u201cBut there are no good options. The least bad option would be capital controls.\u201d Behravesh said there were already signs that China was making it harder for people to take money out of the country. He said the credibility of the Chinese leadership had been undermined by their handling of the financial turbulence since last summer. \u201cThe scary thing has been the ineptitude of Chinese policy makers, who panicked when the stock market fell last August and panicked again at the beginning of this year. They want reform but they don\u2019t really trust markets.\u201d Joachim Gauck, the president of Germany, is addressing the Davos Congress Hall now. He begins by touching on the migration crisis, which is a growing domestic issue in Germany after chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s liberal refugee policy. Almost 60 million are trying to escape war and conflict, and it is presenting the European Union with its biggest ever test, he says. Migration isn\u2019t a new problem, it\u2019s been around for decades as people try to escape from peril, find a better life. He then quotes JK Galbraith, who said that migration was the oldest action against poverty. A look at the list of American Nobel laureates and Oscar price winners shows just how much a country can benefit from migrants\u2019 creativity, Gauck says. Migration, and integration, must be thought of in tandem, he says. But it is our \u201chumanitarian responsibility\u201d to take in people who are fleeing the refugee crisis. He also explains that Germany feels a moral obligation to help, having \u2018fallen so low\u2019 in the past (a reference to the second world war). This may not calm the rebellion within her own party, from those who believe Germany needs to cut the number of migrants entering the country: Update: Gauck goes on to warn that limits may need to be set. Associated Press has a good take: The president of Germany says that limiting the number of refugees entering Europe is necessary and \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d if the continent is to continue to provide help to those in need. While stressing the \u201chumanitarian responsibility\u201d of taking in victims of persecution, Joachim Gauck told a conference in Davos, Switzerland, that Germany and European countries must limit the numbers of people who want to come in to avoid being overwhelmed. My colleague Jill Treanor has spoken to HSBC\u2019s CEO Stuart Gulliver - he has admitted that the bank may not have a decision on whether it is moving its bank out of the UK by next month\u2019s financial results. Al Gore, former US vice-president, says last month\u2019s Paris agreement showed that the world is prepared to do what\u2019s needed to tackle climate change. 195 nations said yes, we will change. The direction of travel has been established....and that message has been received by the World Economic Forum. In Paris, countries committed to keeping global warming down to 1.5 degrees celsius. But there is also disappointment that even more wasn\u2019t achieved. Christiana Figueres, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, says the Paris talks did not end with an agreement on the carbon price because of the lack of unanimity. \u201cThe Paris agreement had to be unanimous, if there was one country that didn\u2019t agree with the carbon price in 2015 had that been rammed down the throat we would not have had a Paris agreement.\u201d A fixed carbon price would encourage investment in solar and other alternative energy sources, she explains. The stock market sell off is getting worse. The FTSE 100 is now down 170 points or 2.8% at 5706 - only around 20 points off a bear market (20% off its peak). Germany\u2019s Dax is down more than 3% and France\u2019s Cac has fallen 3.3%. The US is unlikely to be much help. Ahead of results from Goldman Sachs and the latest US inflation figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are showing a 329 point decline. Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman of advertising giant WPP, has added his voice to those warning that the world faces slowing growth. The new normal is a low-growth world. Inflation is under too much control, we could do with a bit more of it. That scenario will continue. The system couldn\u2019t sustain pre-Lehman growth rates because it blew up in September 2008. Ken Rogoff, former IMF chief economist and Harvard professor, blamed China for the recent market turbulence. It wasnt due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s \u2018microscopic increase\u2019 in interest rates. He also sees trouble ahead in the developing world: For the next year there is going to be a lot of risk in China and the emerging markets, but not such elevated risks for Europe and the US. Climate change is a big theme at Davos, especially after Leonardo DiCaprio attacked the greed of the energy industry last night. Stuart Gulliver, boss of HBSC, has told one panel that the bank sets tougher lending criteria for coal-fired power stations in emerging markets than those in developed economies. He is also optimistic, he said, about funding alternative energy despite the low oil price. \u201c The public wants to do this,\u201d he said, when asked about funding alternative energy and while the cost of financing for such companies currently high he expected it to fall. He also had a warning about suddenly withdrawing all financing for fossil fuels. There would be \u201cunintended consequences\u201d he said as these companies were major employers and paid tax used by governments to pay for health care etc. Gulliver admitted that HSBC\u2019s annual meeting faced protesters from activists trying to end any investment in fossil fuels. Christiana Figueres, UN expert on climate, insisted she was not one of the activities calling for all carbon fuels to be left in the ground. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former Nigerian finance minister, has backed the ebola agreement between Gavi and Merck announced today. There was a \u201cshared terror\u201d in Africa last year, she says, during the ebola outbreak in which more than 11,000 people died. Amira Yahyaoui, the Tunisian journalist who is co-chairing this year\u2019s meeting, says the rise of smarter machines (the 4th industrial revolution), should spur humans to understand what makes them human. Speaking on a panel, she says humans are no longer in a monopoly on planet Earth. We are in competition with things that might be better than we are. We are the ones destroying the planet, we are the ones killing humans. So this 4th industrial revolution should maybe be a revolution of values. Yahyaoui also challenged WEF for not achieving gender parity at the forum (although there are three male and three female co-chairs this year, including General Motors boss Mary Barra and International Trade Union chief Sharan Burrow). Eighteen percent of this forum are women, 18 is nothing. I come from a country supposed to be very anti-woman and we are more than 33% women in parliament and we have parity in every election. [WEF has made some efforts on this issue, and offers an extra place to businesses who send at least one female delegate] She\u2019s also concerned that the percentage of people under 30 here is \u201cway less than 18%\u201d. Every generation has been driven by youth, and this one will be too, Yahyaoui continues. Unfortunately, older people love progress, but they hate change, and revolutions are all about change, she concludes. It\u2019s not by improving the candle that we created electricity, and it\u2019s time to create electricity. Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University, said: All regions except London experienced a fall in the unemployment rate, suggesting that the recovery is now well and truly being felt nationwide. The construction industry has continued to play a leading part in the recovery - the number of jobs in this sector has increased by some 77000. Administrative and business support functions have also seen considerable growth - of 50000 jobs - over the latest period. The role played by construction is accentuated further by the continuing high rates of pay increase in that sector. Compared with a year earlier, pay in this sector in November amounted to some 5.6% higher. Taking the economy overall, pay growth remains comparatively muted, at 2.0% - though with negligible price inflation, workers are now experiencing noticeable increases in their real wages. So long as productivity gains can be restored, there is no reason to believe that the increase we are now seeing in pay levels should become inflationary. We should not therefore be expecting an interest rate hike any time soon. And here\u2019s chancellor George Osborne on the day\u2019s data: On the jobs data, James Knightley at ING Bank said: The UK labour data looks pretty decent with employment growth in the three months to November rising 267,000 and the unemployment rate falling to 5.1%, both are better than the 235,000 and 5.2% consensus predictions. However, wage growth did slow close to expectations (ex bonus the three month average is now 1.9% year on year although the single month reading did rise to 2.1% from 1.6%). Consequently, it is an encouraging report that should keep consumer confidence and spending running at healthy levels. However, with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney suggesting there is little appetite for a rate hike any time soon and with the prospect of a Brexit vote set to weigh on activity it looks as though November remains the earliest possible opportunity for a rate rise. Still, sterling has come off its lows following the figures. After hitting a seven year low of $1.4125 it has recovered to $1.4162. Here\u2019s are the average earnings: The government\u2019s plans to cut back the public sector show through in the jobs data. For September 2015, 17.1% of people in employment worked in the public sector, the lowest proportion since comparable records began in 1999. Here\u2019s the Reuters take on the UK data: Wage growth in Britain in the three months to November was its slowest since February, official data showed on Wednesday, the latest sign the Bank of England will take its time before raising interest rates. The slowing in wage growth came even as Britain\u2019s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 5.1 percent, its lowest since early 2006, from 5.2 percent in the three months to October. The BoE is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it considers when to raise interest rates at a time when inflation has hovered near zero for months and weakness in the global economy is hurting British output. The unemployment rate of 5.1% was below forecasts of a 5.2% figure. Total weekly earnings rose 2%, compared to expectations of 2.1%. This is also the weakest growth since February. On the wages front, average weekly earnings excluding bonuses rose 1.9% in the three months to November, compared to expectations of a 1.8% rise. This was the weakest growth since February last year. The November figure was 2.1% year on year. For September to November 2015, 74% of people aged from 16 to 64 were in work, the highest employment rate since comparable records began in 1971, according to the Office for National Statistics. The UK December claimant count has fallen 4,300 compared to expectations of a 2,500 rise. The jobless numbers fell 99,000 to 1.675m in the three months to November, meaning the unemployment rate is 5.1%, its lowest since the three months to January 2006. Employment rose by 267,000, the third biggest increase on record. With crude still tumbling - Brent is now down 2.8% at $27.88 a barrel - Shell has spelled out the damage the slump in oil prices is doing to its business. Our energy editor Terry Macalister reports: Shell has warned that its fourth-quarter profits may be 50% lower than last time with full year write-offs as high as $7bn (\u00a35bn), underlining the damage being wreaked on the industry by low crude prices. In the first preliminary results to be reported this year by any of the large oil companies, Shell said it expected earnings to come in at between $1.6bn and $1.9bn and full-year numbers as low as $10.4bn. Further losses will be taken in the last three months of the year, bringing the total amount of writedowns on the sale of assets and other one-off losses to as high as $7bn. The dismal figures ramp up the pressure on Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, who is trying to justify the \u00a335bn takeover of rival BG which must be agreed by more than 50% of Shell shareholders next week. The full story is here: Gavi, the vaccine group, is announcing a new deal with drugs company Merck to get access to its ebola vaccine. Under the scheme, Merck will make 300,000 doses of the vaccine available in the next few months, for clinical trials and in case there is another outbreak. The vaccine not been fully licenced yet, but testing last year found it was 100% effective in providing protection against ebola. Seth Berkley, the head of Gavi, says there was initially a \u201ccomplete market failure\u201d with ebola, as there was no commercial demand for a vaccine. But the outbreak in 2015, in which more than 11,000 people died, has helped force a rethink. Merck\u2019s product, called VSV-ZEBOV live attenuated Ebola Zaire vaccine, is the most promising available, Berkley says. The suffering caused by the Ebola crisis was a wake-up call to many in the global health industry,\u201d Berkley told an audience at Davos. This agreement means we will be \u201cahead of the curve\u201d next time. The deal will also help Merck to get the vaccine win approval from the World Health Organisation, he added. Gavi is providing $5m to help Merck submit the drug for licensing by the end of 2017. Julie Gerberding, vice-president for public health at Merck, says her company is committed to getting their ebole vaccine fully licenced. She says: The scale and speed of the firestorm in Africa reminded us that mother nature is the best terrorist. It showed that we need to prepare in advance, and also respond quickly when a crisis occurs. And when we have a licenced ebola vaccine, we will make it available at the lowest possible not-for-profit price, Gerberding pledges. Anand Mahindra, director of Indian company Mahinda and Mahindra, is one of the speakers on a panel about the transformation of tomorrow. \u201cI was scared\u201d he said when having dinner in New York and the young girls sitting next to him didn\u2019t talk to each other for 15 minutes while they used their phones. His daughter told him that they would be posting imagines on instagram. \u201cIt was some kind of ghost world,\u201d he said. Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook is sitting alongside him, making the point that tomorrow won\u2019t be transformed while men keep ruling the world. \u201cMen still run the world and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going that well\u201d. She conducted a poll of audience - how many women had been told they were too aggressive at work and asked if they should be working. Hands went up. She talked about Facebook\u2019s civil courage initiative to try to end hate on he social network. \u201cThere is no place for hate and intolerance on our platform,\u201d she said. Facebook\u2019s CEO, Sheryl Sandburg, is discussing the future of technology now: In the wake of falls on Asian markets, investors in Europe are seeing heavy losses at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is down 110 points or 1.8% 5766, its lowest level since November 2012 and less than 100 points off a bear market (down 20% from its all time high last April). Germany\u2019s Dax is down 2.3% while France\u2019s Cac has fallen 2.4% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is down 2.6%. The head of Swiss banking giant UBS, Axel Weber, has added to the angst in Davos by warning that we are stuck in an era of low growth. He pointed out that the International Monetary Fund has consistently been downgrading its short-term growth forecasts, as hopes for a strong recovery have consistently been dashed. Weber says: \u201cLast year the forecast of the IMF for that year was 2% lower than the forecast three years out. It\u2019s just a sign of the fact we are and have moved to a lower growth environment, where the rebound of growth rates we\u2019ve seen in the past we are unlikely to see again soon. We are coming out of biggest global crisis in many decades and it will take time to heal\u201d. Weber also argues that something fundamental has changed - this isn\u2019t just a cyclical phenomenon. And that has left central bankers struggling: As he put it: One of the reasons why growth cannot be reignited is the central banks also have a difficulty to reignite inflation rates. Most of the central banks tell you (their target) is to have inflation rate of around 2%, quantitative easing and massively expanding the balance sheet does not lead to an uptick of inflation close to target at least on the time horizon of one to two years out\u201d. \u201cWe are seeing a low growth, low interest rate environment with low interest rates. We will have to get used to the lower growth environment and low interest rate environment\u201d. Tuesday\u2019s market rally has proved shortlived, with Asian markets down sharply and Europe forecast to follow suit. After rising on talk of growing Chinese demand for oil and hopes of more central bank stimulus to boost the world\u2019s second largest economy, crude is falling back once more. That appears to be a belated reaction to the International Energy Agency saying the market could \u201cdrown in oversupply.\u201d Brent crude is now down nearly 2% at $28.19 a barrel, while WTI is down 3.3% at $27.52. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the respite from recent negative sentiment has gained little traction: The inability of US markets to hold onto most of its gains was the first clue as oil prices slipped back off their highs once again. Furthermore it is this inability to sustain rebounds for any length of time that continues to gnaw away at investor sentiment in the short term, and keep the pressure on the downside. Here\u2019s our story on the falling Asian markets, with Japan now technically in a bear market: Business leaders in Davos are rather gloomier this year, according to a new report from PricewaterhouseCoopers last night. Terrorism, oil, and China, mean bosses are more worried than at any time in the last 5 years: Good morning from Davos, Switzerland, where the 2016 Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. There\u2019s a bit of snow in the air this morning, and more than a bit of anxiety as global leaders, business chiefs, campaigners, celebrities and the media converge on the small ski resort. This year\u2019s WEF is racked with fears. For example: Will robots devour millions of jobs? How bad is the Chinese economy really? When will the rout in the stock markets end, and does it herald a wave of defaults? Is oil going to hit $20 per barrel, or even $10, and what will that means for petr-exporters? Can the turmoil in the Middle East be tamed? Will Europe sink under the pressure of the refugee crisis? Delegates have a lot on their plates this year, whether they\u2019re mingling in the congress centre or holding top-level meetings behind closed doors. There\u2019s a lot happening today, but here\u2019s a few key events we\u2019ll try to cover: 9am Davos time (8am GMT): Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg and Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella debate the 4th industrial revolution 9.30am: Vaccine group GAVI and Merck announce an ebola vaccine deal 10.30: A session on preventing future shocks in the financial markets, 11.20am: German president Joachim Gauck discusses the migration crisis 3.20pm: Canada\u2019s new PM Justin Trudeau 3.45pm: A session on the refugee crisis, including Queen Rania of Jordan, Peter Maurer of the Red Cross, and Hamdi Ulukaya of Chobani 5.45pm: US vice-president Joe Biden discusses geopolitical security. The full programme is online here. We also get the latest UK unemployment report this morning (9.30am GMT) and US inflation data this afternoon. And while all that\u2019s going on, the stock markets are expected to suffer another bad day. There\u2019s already been a heavy selloff in Asia, and we\u2019re expecting the FTSE 100 to tumble at the open. Here\u2019s the opening calls: UK FTSE: 5767 -110 points German DAX: 9438 -221 French CAC: 4176 -96 Spanish IBEX: 8401 -154 Angus Nicholson of IG says that concerns over China\u2019s slowing economy are building. The somewhat mystifying 3%+ rally in Mainland equities yesterday has proved short-lived and this is likely to punish commodities on European and US exchanges. Some more of the Chinese GDP data has filtered out today and concerns about Chinese economic growth seeing a very weak Q1 in 2016 are growing. So it could be a dramatic day....",

      "bodyText": "This time last month stock markets were starting an end-of-year rally, cheerfully regarding the US Federal Reserve\u2019s small increase in interest rates as evidence of the underlying strength of the global economy. Now, says William White, former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, the situation is as bad as in 2007, the onset of the banking crash. The FTSE 100 has lost 9% of its value since the turn of the year. The yield on 10-year US Treasuries \u2013 a harder gauge of risk-aversion \u2013 has fallen to just 2%, even as inflation appears in the US. What has happened to turn financial markets on a sixpence? On the face of it, not much. The price of oil has fallen further, but aren\u2019t low oil prices meant to lubricate spending and investment, at least in the countries that import the stuff? Growth in China in 2015 slowed to 6.9%, the weakest for a quarter of a century, but nobody thought the old pace could be sustained. And, anyway, isn\u2019t it good news that China has stopped building motorways to nowhere and is directing its economy towards consumption? The extra ingredient may be one they were fretting about in Davos on Wednesday \u2013 liquidity. The supposed titans were not referring to their next champagne refill, but to the idea that financial markets aren\u2019t as deep and free-flowing as they used to be. Blame the post-crisis regulations that restrict what banks and insurers can hold as core capital, and how much backing they need to make two-way markets in assets. Or blame investors for throwing silly sums into emerging markets to escape ultra-low interest rates in the west. The outcome may be the same: markets can swing violently when everybody rushes for the same exit. Min Zhu, deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, put it this way: \u201cThe key issue is that liquidity could drop dramatically, and that scares everyone. If everybody is moving together we don\u2019t have any liquidity at all. We have to be ready to act very fast.\u201d It\u2019s far from clear what such action would be. But one assumes a first port of call would be a postponement of further rises in US interest rates. If the panic intensifies, it may come to that. But the moral would be alarming. It would mean that the global economy has merely been pumped up by years of easy credit, and is still so fragile that it can\u2019t handle a minuscule adjustment in US interest rates that the Fed signalled for two years in advance. That would be a proper reason to worry. Unfortunately, it looks increasingly like the true position. Can you be sure of Shell? Still, at least someone is cheerful. He is Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Shell, who says he is \u201cpleased\u201d with the company\u2019s performance in 2015, despite warning of a slide of 50% in profits in the final quarter. Van Beurden is getting ready to toast the \u00a333bn takeover of BG Group. \u201cThe completion of the BG transaction, which we are expecting in a matter of weeks, will mark the start of a new chapter in Shell, to rejuvenate the company, and improve shareholder returns,\u201d he says. If you share his optimism, and think the spectacular decline in the oil price must reverse sooner rather than later, there\u2019s rarely been a better time to buy a slice of Shell. At \u00a312.77 \u2013 half the level in mid-2014 \u2013 the shares now offer an astonishing dividend yield of 10%. Yes, this the same Shell that famously hasn\u2019t cut its dividend in decades. What\u2019s more, Shell keeps telling us it is committed to its current dividend for the next two years, and did so again on Wednesday. It said dividends for 2015 will be $1.88 a share for 2015 \u2013 currently equivalent to \u00a31.32 \u2013 and at least the same again for 2016, assuming the BG deal gets the nod from shareholders next week. Is it really plausible, though, that Shell can maintain such a payout? The company can hack at its capital spending budgets \u2013 on Wednesday it confirmed investment for the combined Shell/BG group will be $33bn this year, a reduction of 45% from peak levels in 2013 \u2013 but there are limits to how far oil companies can cut spending without damaging their ability to produce. With BG on board, the dividend bill will be $15bn a year, surely an unaffordable luxury if the oil price does not rebound to, say, $60 within 18 months or so. That leaves some time to wait and see, but it\u2019s not only van Beurden\u2019s future that is riding on the dividend. Shell, even before adding BG, accounts for 10% of the dividends paid by UK-listed companies. A few UK pension funds will require rejuvenation if the oil price doesn\u2019t rebound. HSBC\u2019s HQ hiccup Oh dear, HSBC still can\u2019t decide when it will make a decision about where it wants to locate its headquarters \u2013 in London, Hong Kong, or somewhere else. White smoke had been promised from the boardroom by the end of last year; then a delay was signalled in November. Now, says chief executive Stuart Gulliver, next month\u2019s full-year figures will include \u201can update,\u201d which is not necessarily the same as a decision. What is HSBC waiting for? Evidence that Chinese financial regulators know how to run a stock market? You may be waiting a while.",

Inflation remains low at just 0.2%, allowing living standards to continue rising, on average. But analysts said the trend for weakening wage growth reinforced their view that the Bank of England will delay increasing interest rates until later in the year, or in 2017. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, on Tuesday ruled out any early rise, saying UK growth was still too weak and pointing to recent turmoil in the global financial markets. Ruth Miller, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cToday\u2019s UK labour market figures showed a further slowdown in wage growth, suggesting that an interest rate hike is still some way off.\u201d John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said the Bank of England committee that sets interest rates needed to go back to the drawing board to explain how a rise in employment can be coupled with a fall in wage growth. He said: \u201cWe need to rethink what we mean by a \u2018tight labour market\u2019. Unemployment may now have to fall to a very low rate, perhaps below 4%, before we see strong upward pressure on pay.\u201d Average weekly wages remain \u00a327 below their 2007 peak of \u00a3490, the Resolution Foundation said, emphasising the inability to translate a strong demand for workers into a boost in take-home pay. George Osborne welcomed an influx of women and young people to the workforce over the past year. \u201cEmployment is at its highest rate in our history; there are more women in work than ever before and 130,000 fewer young people unemployed than this time last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, full-time employees make up the majority of the increase in employment over the past year and wages are growing even before our new \u2018national living wage\u2019 takes effect in April. But the chancellor added: \u201cAs I have said, there is a dangerous cocktail of new risks this year in the global economy, so it\u2019s more important than ever we must stick to our plan to fix the public finances and move Britain back into the black.\u201d The jobless total dropped to 1.68 million, 99,000 fewer than for June to August 2015 and 239,000 fewer than for a year earlier. Employment growth accelerated, with the 267,000 quarterly rise in the three months to November up from a 207,000 increase in October. The Office for National Statistics said: \u201cThe employment rate has been generally increasing since early 2012 and, for the latest time period, September to November 2015, it reached a record high of 74.0%.\u201d The ONS prefers to measure wages using a rolling three-month figure to offset volatile pay awards, but it also publishes month-on-month wages figure that rose to 2.1% from 1.6% in the previous month, excluding bonuses. Adjusted for inflation, regular pay increased by 1.9% and total pay increased by 2.1% Taking a longer view, the ONS said average total pay for employees increased from \u00a3311 a week in January 2000 to \u00a3494 a week in November 2015; an increase of 58.7%. Over the same period, prices have increased by 39.3%. A rise in the number of people gaining full-time employment was coupled with a jump in the number of self-employed to a new record of 4.6 million. David Kern, the chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK was blessed with a \u201dvibrant and dynamic labour market\u201d but warned of continuing problems for young people in gaining a job. \u201cWhile the youth unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the 2008 downturn, it is still much higher than the national average,\u201d he said. The youth jobless rate remained almost two and a half times the average unemployment rate after nudging down to 13.7% from 13.8% in October.",

John Griffith-Jones said it \u201cwasn\u2019t ideal\u201d that the chancellor revealed on radio that Tracey McDermott, the acting chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, would not be taking the job full-time. Griffith-Jones\u2019s admission came as he fielded concerns from MPs that the organisation he chairs is lacking in independence, is too weak and is low in morale. Referring to Osborne\u2019s comments in early January, he said: \u201cI was in the dentist\u2019s chair at the time. I never got out so quickly.\u201d Griffith-Jones was speaking to members of the Treasury select committee, who wanted to know why the FCA, whose former chief executive, Martin Wheatley, was not given a new contract last year by the chancellor, had recently dropped a review into banking culture. When asked by the committee chair, Andrew Tyrie, whether the FCA had been put under pressure to do anything that would compromise its independence over the decision to jettison its culture review, Griffith-Jones said: \u201cNo. I did not feel a sense of pressure at all.\u201d Members of the committee quizzed the FCA chairman as to why the decision to discontinue the review into banking culture had not been communicated by the regulator with a full statement. Instead, it was allowed to leak out after the FCA had already informed a number of people about its decision. Towards the end of the session, Griffith-Jones said it might have made sense to have announced the decision formally. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t explained these sort of decisions in a lot of detail before,\u201d he said. The committee heard how the FCA had relayed its decision to banks involved in the culture review in December. The story emerged on New Year\u2019s Eve. Griffith-Jones said the decision did not reflect an organisation that was going soft on banks. \u201cThere are many ways to skin a cat,\u201d he said. Both he and McDermott insisted that the FCA felt there were better ways of making an impression on banking culture than continuing with its review. McDermott said: \u201cThe reaction to the decision [to ditch the review] is based on the concern that there has been a change of direction. That\u2019s not what it is.\u201d She added: \u201cEvery decision that I have taken has been taken on merit. We need close liaision with the Treasury, as we did the other days on the cap on exit charges.\u201d But the acting chief executive found it difficult to disguise her irritation about the way her own decision not to stand for the top job full-time had been released by the chancellor. \u201cIt rather threw the day\u2019s plans,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t anticipated having to address the staff. It would have been preferable to announce it once they all knew.\u201d Griffith-Jones added: \u201cThe substantive point is that we get a strong successor. We were in a tight spot in the summer and now we need a full-time replacement. We need support and confidence to do our job.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE I think we\u2019re witnessing a collision of events which has provoked an immediate sense of crisis. Whether it\u2019s commodities, China, oil prices, terrorism, geopolitical turbulence \u2013 all have landed particularly in the month of January, and there is an immediate impact which is reflected in the stock market. At the moment what is being discounted are some of the positives that come out of low oil prices in economic terms. It is only being looked at in the lens of bad news. It is too early to say whether this is a crisis of lasting proportion but I think we should certainly continue to focus on addressing the challenges that are there for all. China may have slowed down but it\u2019s not stopped. Europe is fragile but is focused on improvement and with the UK\u2019s engagement in encouraging a more competitive Europe. America still has the fundamentals of an entrepreneurial spirit, self-sufficiency in energy. When you look to the positive, while things are far from perfect, we are not at the point of absolute crisis. Philip Jennings, general secretary of the UNI global union Yes, we are heading for a crash, I\u2019m worried about it. Emerging markets were meant to pull us through this crisis. but China is slowing, and the impact will ripple out across the developing economy. And the jobs situation across the global economy will not improve. We are worried abut the economic climate - how deep the crash will be. Those RBS analysts [who advised clients to sell everything] may be right - \u201ccataclysm\u201d could be the right word to use. We need leadership. The G20 needs to fulfil the promise they made at the last financial crisis, to not just save the banking sector but to also put the economy back on track. The private sector need to understand that lack of investment isn\u2019t helping, and we need to push wages higher. The G20 needs to put demand back in the economy. Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF I don\u2019t think the markets are melting down. The market is in the process of adjusting. When markets adjust, there is always uncertainty and volatility, but is it not a meltdown. The key issue is that liquidity could drop dramatically, and that scares everyone. If everybody is moving together we don\u2019t have any liquidity at all. We have to be ready to act very fast. We still have global growth of 3.4%, but the political risk today is the key risk, which implies we are facing a lot of uncertainties and a lot of shocks. It is hard to predict how things link to each other. That\u2019s the key risk, really. Nouriel Roubini, economist It is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time. The big thing that should happen is China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms. Ken Rogoff, Harvard professor It feels to me that there is a panic in the markets that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into the real economy. If China goes from 7% growth to minus 2% growth then everybody will be in recession. If it goes to 3-4% growth, it will probably not be enough to cause a recession in the developed world. But it is definitely a very precarious situation for emerging markets. Chinese policymakers should let the exchange rate and the stock market find their own level. This is the third leg of the debt supercycle. First is was the US, then it was Europe, now it is China. Adam Posen, former Bank of England policymaker, now at the Peterson Institute I don\u2019t think we are on the edge of another financial crisis. I don\u2019t even think we are on the edge of another crash. The idea that things are as overvalued as they were last time is false. Governments should be taking advantage of low interest rates to improve public infrastructure, and China should boost its economy by creating a social safety net. At the margin, I am not sure the Federal Reserve did the right thing by raising rates last month but I am not sure it was a big mistake. But if the Bank of England or the ECB raised rates, that would be a big mistake. Dennis Nally, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers I don\u2019t know whether we are heading for another crash but the environment is clearly having an effect on markets and on the attitudes that exist here in Davos. Confidence levels are down: the volatility we are seeing, there are more threats today than ever. Some people are speculating oil could reach $10 a barrel. I don\u2019t think any of us know. All of this uncertainty has a direct impact on confidence levels. There needs to be more dialogue about how to [bring] stability back into the system. I believe there is a disconnect between government, regulators and business. Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT On the balance of probabilities, no [it\u2019s not another crash] \u2013 but it is very finely balanced. It is an unstable environment. In terms of doing business, I\u2019ve just been at a lunch and most of the CEOs there say most of the underlying businesses are pretty good. If there is contagion in financial markets into the business markets that is going to affect confidence, and that\u2019s when we could see a slowdown. We\u2019ve got to get used to a period of time when the world is just more volatile and we have to be able to live and manage through those sort of conditions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away. We need the financial markets to settle down and hope that confidence remains strong and that it doesn\u2019t affect people\u2019s underlying desire to do business. What is really going in China is a big [concern], elections and referendum around the world is an issue and the state of things in the Middle East, which have a knock-on effect. Bob Diamond, former chief executive of Barclays It is a correction \u2013 a healthy correction. A lot of people are trying to compare it to 2008, but during the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 we probably had the deepest economic correction I have seen. I don\u2019t see us going into that position. The US economy is still strong, Europe is doing surprising well - the easier monetary policy led by governor [of the European Central Bank Mario] Draghi has shown some positives. There is a correction in China. If China slows down to 6 or 7% [growth] is that a success? That\u2019s fine. Stuart Gulliver, chief executive, HSBC You always get an overshoot in times of significant selloffs. I think we will see further adjustments before we hit equilibrium. But we\u2019re closer to equilibrium than we were a couple of weeks ago. We\u2019re towards the end of this sort of selloff.",

      "body": "<h2>Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE</h2> <p>I think we\u2019re witnessing a collision of events which has provoked an immediate sense of crisis. Whether it\u2019s commodities, China, oil prices, terrorism, geopolitical turbulence \u2013 all have landed particularly in the month of January, and there is an immediate impact which is reflected in the stock market. At the moment what is being discounted are some of the positives that come out of low oil prices in economic terms. It is only being looked at in the lens of bad news. </p> <p>It is too early to say whether this is a crisis of lasting proportion but I think we should certainly continue to focus on addressing the challenges that are there for all. China may have slowed down but it\u2019s not stopped. Europe is fragile but is focused on improvement and with the UK\u2019s engagement in encouraging a more competitive Europe. America still has the fundamentals of an entrepreneurial spirit, self-sufficiency in energy.</p> <p>When you look to the positive, while things are far from perfect, we are not at the point of absolute crisis.</p> <h2>Philip Jennings, general secretary of the UNI global union<br></h2> <p>Yes, we are heading for a crash, I\u2019m worried about it.</p> <p>Emerging markets were meant to pull us through this crisis. but China is slowing, and the impact will ripple out across the developing economy. And the jobs situation across the global economy will not improve.</p> <p>We are worried abut the economic climate - how deep the crash will be. Those RBS analysts [who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/12/sell-everything-ahead-of-stock-market-crash-say-rbs-economists\">advised clients to sell everything</a>] may be right - \u201ccataclysm\u201d could be the right word to use.</p> <p>We need leadership. The G20 needs to fulfil the promise they made at the last financial crisis, to not just save the banking sector but to also put the economy back on track.</p> <p>The private sector need to understand that lack of investment isn\u2019t helping, and we need to push wages higher. The G20 needs to put demand back in the economy.</p> <h2><br></h2> <h2>Min Zhu, deputy managing director of the IMF</h2> <p>I don\u2019t think the markets are melting down. The market is in the process of adjusting. When markets adjust, there is always uncertainty and volatility, but is it not a meltdown.</p> <p>The key issue is that liquidity could drop dramatically, and that scares everyone. If everybody is moving together we don\u2019t have any liquidity at all. We have to be ready to act very fast.</p> <p>We still have global growth of 3.4%, but the political risk today is the key risk, which implies we are facing a lot of uncertainties and a lot of shocks. It is hard to predict how things link to each other. That\u2019s the key risk, really.</p> <h2>Nouriel Roubini, economist</h2> <p>It is not going to be like 2008-09. There is not the excessive leverage in the financial system that there was last time.</p> <p>The big thing that should happen is China should stop kicking the can down the road and get on with some serious structural reforms.</p> <h2>Ken Rogoff, Harvard professor</h2> <p>It feels to me that there is a panic in the markets that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into the real economy.</p> <p>If China goes from 7% growth to minus 2% growth then everybody will be in recession. If it goes to 3-4% growth, it will probably not be enough to cause a recession in the developed world. But it is definitely a very precarious situation for emerging markets.</p> <p>Chinese policymakers should let the exchange rate and the stock market find their own level. This is the third leg of the debt supercycle. First is was the US, then it was Europe, now it is China.</p> <h2>Adam Posen, former Bank of England policymaker, now at the Peterson Institute</h2> <p>I don\u2019t think we are on the edge of another financial crisis. I don\u2019t even think we are on the edge of another crash. The idea that things are as overvalued as they were last time is false.</p> <p>Governments should be taking advantage of low interest rates to improve public infrastructure, and China should boost its economy by creating a social safety net.</p> <p>At the margin, I am not sure the Federal Reserve did the right thing by raising rates last month but I am not sure it was a big mistake. But if the Bank of England or the ECB raised rates, that would be a big mistake.</p> <h2>Dennis Nally, chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers</h2> <p>I don\u2019t know whether we are heading for another crash but the environment is clearly having an effect on markets and on the attitudes that exist here in Davos.</p> <p>Confidence levels are down: the volatility we are seeing, there are more threats today than ever. Some people are speculating oil could reach $10 a barrel. I don\u2019t think any of us know. All of this uncertainty has a direct impact on confidence levels.</p> <p>There needs to be more dialogue about how to [bring] stability back into the system. I believe there is a disconnect between government, regulators and business.</p> <h2>Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT</h2> <p>On the balance of probabilities, no [it\u2019s not another crash] \u2013 but it is very finely balanced.</p> <p>It is an unstable environment.

      "bodyText": "Another day, another financial spasm. In London, New York, Shanghai and Frankfurt the story was the same: shares dumped and the oil price crashing to its lowest level since 2003 on fears that China is heading into a recession that will drag the rest of the world economy down with it. Despite the fresh sell-off in financial markets on Wednesday, this is far from a done deal. For the doomsday scenario to materialise, China would need to have a hard landing, rather than simply a bumpy one, the rest of the world would have to be ripe for its own crisis, and there would need to be a transmission mechanism for delivering a problem centred on east Asia to the rest of the global economy. For the time being, the theory that the events of the past three weeks herald another 2008-style crisis is just that: a hypothesis. But make no mistake, if the conditions for a recession are right, it would move around the world like a pandemic. That, after all, is the essence of globalisation. Economies are far more integrated than they were half a century ago, when capital controls, trade barriers and extensive public ownership shielded national economies. Today, changes in political philosophy and technology mean there are far fewer impediments to the free movement of goods \u2013 and virtually none at all to the free movement of money. So, when one country runs into problems there is always the risk of contagion. That was true of Thailand in 1997, when the collapse of its currency, the baht, quickly had a domino effect across south-east Asia. It was true also of what appeared to be a local difficulty in a much bigger economy. Ben Bernanke, then chairman of the US Federal Reserve, was dismissive in 2006 of the notion that problems with sub-prime mortgages posed a threat to the American, let alone the global, economy. How wrong he was. Britain\u2019s direct exposure to China is relatively modest. It is not in the top five overseas markets for UK companies, and only 4% of UK goods and services go there. If China\u2019s economy hits the wall, some jobs would be at risk but it would not be nearly as serious as a recession in the United States or the eurozone. The US has more at stake, but even so exports to China account for only 1% of GDP. Britain\u2019s banks are, however, a different story. UK banks \u2013 HSBC and Standard Chartered in particular \u2013 have lent lots of money to China to the extent that they have more at risk than any other country, should the loans turn sour. China has a mountain of bad debts. So how would the crisis manifest itself? One way, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at analysts IHS, would be if China stopped trying to support its currency, the yuan. The result, he says, would be a devaluation of 15-20% that would make China\u2019s exports cheaper but those of every other country more expensive. This would be the opening salvo in a full-blown currency war. Other countries would retaliate and the US would impose trade sanctions on Chinese goods. Deflationary pressure would intensify as Asian countries dumped their excess production on the rest of the world. The UK steel industry has already had a taste of this. China is producing more steel than it needs for its own economic growth and is selling it at cut-price rates. British producers have found it impossible to compete. That, though, would only be the start of the mayhem. Many countries in the emerging world have borrowed heavily in dollars. China itself has $1tn of dollar-denominated debt. If the yuan and other emerging market currencies are devalued, then the value of these dollar debts will rise, putting severe strain on all the affected economies and unbearable strain on the most vulnerable. Zhu Min, deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, sketched out in Davos on Wednesday what would happen next. Quite simply, every investor would stampede for the exit at the same time. Liquidity in the global economy would dry up, he said, noting: \u201cThat scares everybody.\u201d It certainly does. Around the concrete bunker hosting the World Economic Forum, the masters of the universe were quietly checking the latest from the financial markets on their smartphones and tablets. A few eyebrows were raised when the Dow\u2019s fall reached 500 points. Chief executives of multinational corporations should not, of course, need to be reminded of global interconnectedness. If they did, Nobel prize-winning scientists were on hand in Davos for a tutorial on chaos theory. One of its ideas is that seemingly tiny events can have big impacts, so that a beating of a butterfly\u2019s wing could lead to a hurricane on the other side of the world. China is a very big butterfly.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One edition of the Guardian, with its coverage of job losses in the steel industry (Time for tariffs on Chinese steel?, 19 January), the need to prevent millions more fleeing to Europe (The Geneva refugee convention can\u2019t cope with this crisis. Time for a rethink) and the super rich buying politicians to prevent adequate controls on the use of foreign tax havens (We\u2019ve been conned by the rich predators of Davos), all points to one thing: the destructiveness of open borders. Yet virtually all political parties, business groupings and, to their shame, trade unions and NGOs, either rejoice in, or fail to adequately challenge, these trends. In addition, the status quo\u2019s constant prioritisation of competitiveness and exports fails to grasp that China is a destructive export-dumping machine determined to build up its domestic economy. Hardly the likely saviour of an ever-slowing global economy. A fairer \u201clook to the local\u201d approach is exactly what Europe needs to introduce. To do so it will need to rewrite its already crumbling open-market rulebook, the treaty of Rome. This should be replaced by a \u201ctreaty of Home\u201d, emphasising the re-establishment of appropriate border controls to help the continent\u2019s regional, national and local economies to flourish. Only this would allow the likes of the steel industry to be saved, to curb the ability of the rich to use tax-dodging havens and prevent the extreme right capitalising on the European public\u2019s growing resistance to uncontrolled migration from inside and outside the EU. Colin Hines Twickenham \u2022 The government will try to convince us that the crisis in steel is the fault of the Chinese; that the steel industry in the rest of Europe is in the same predicament and that the government is doing all it can to help. Although it is true that the current crisis is fuelled in part by the \u201cdumping\u201d of excess production by the Chinese, the broader long-term picture is that the steel industry has been undermined by Tory governments for many years. Anyone seeking the truth should look at historic worldwide steel production figures. In the 1970s only three countries produced more steel than the UK. By 2014 we had dropped to 18th place in the world. Many of those overtaking us are emerging economies, as may be expected, but France, Spain and Turkey have also done so. Most importantly, of 20 European countries which make significant amounts of steel, only three have reduced production levels since the 70s and none have cut back more than the UK. And when did this all begin in earnest? In 1980, shortly after Margaret Thatcher came to power. Since then, the UK steel industry has faced many crises and closures. That long-term decline does not apply elsewhere in Europe, because many other governments have supported their major industries, rather than their bankers. Mike Mosley Norwich \u2022 It appears, from listening to business ministers, that there is no way to save the steel industry because of EU laws. David Cameron has been all over Europe to negotiate staying in the EU. Has he mentioned the plight of the steel industry, which affects other European countries too? I don\u2019t hear it as one of his reforms, nor Eurosceptics making it a reason why we should exit. Cameron is only interested in easy wins. Changing EU law is difficult. Have we asked countries like Germany how they are managing the crisis? What if China flooded the financial services industry? This government is quick to fund new jobs, but slow to protect old jobs in manufacturing industries. So much for the economic competency that gave them a majority. All they seem to have done is kept house prices high, replaced public debt with private in order to claim growth and overseen an unbalanced economy. Graham Ullathorne Chesterfield, Derbyshire \u2022 As a long-standing Labour member I feel frustrated at the party\u2019s lack of response to the steel crisis (Report, 19 January). In Labour\u2019s heartlands of Yorkshire and Wales, thousands of jobs are being lost and towns will be economically decimated. There is demand for steel but it needs intervention, which Labour should be busting a gut to facilitate. Instead, there\u2019s endless navel-gazing and talk about issues like Trident and Europe, which are largely hypothetical.

      "body": "<p>One edition of the Guardian, with its coverage of job losses in the steel industry (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jan/18/only-stiff-tariffs-on-chinese-steel-will-reinforce-uk-producers\" title=\"\">Time for tariffs on Chinese steel?</a>, 19 January), the need to prevent millions more fleeing to Europe (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/18/geneva-refugee-convention-crisis-demand-eu\" title=\"\">The Geneva refugee convention can\u2019t cope with this crisis. Time for a rethink</a>) and the super rich buying politicians to prevent adequate controls on the use of foreign tax havens (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/19/davos-super-rich-wealth-inequality\" title=\"\">We\u2019ve been conned by the rich predators of Davos</a>), all points to one thing: the destructiveness of open borders. Yet virtually all political parties, business groupings and, to their shame, trade unions and NGOs, either rejoice in, or fail to adequately challenge, these trends. In addition, the status quo\u2019s constant prioritisation of competitiveness and exports fails to grasp that China is a destructive export-dumping machine determined to build up its domestic economy. Hardly the likely saviour of an ever-slowing global economy.</p> <p>A fairer \u201clook to the local\u201d approach is exactly what Europe needs to introduce. To do so it will need to rewrite its already crumbling open-market rulebook, the treaty of Rome. This should be replaced by a \u201ctreaty of Home\u201d, emphasising the re-establishment of appropriate border controls to help the continent\u2019s regional, national and local economies to flourish. Only this would allow the likes of the steel industry to be saved, to curb the ability of the rich to use tax-dodging havens and prevent the extreme right capitalising on the European public\u2019s growing resistance to uncontrolled migration from inside and outside the EU.<br><strong>Colin Hines</strong><br><em>Twickenham</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government will try to convince us that the crisis in steel is the fault of the Chinese; that the steel industry in the rest of Europe is in the same predicament and that the government is doing all it can to help. Although it is true that the current crisis is fuelled in part by the \u201cdumping\u201d of excess production by the Chinese, the broader long-term picture is that the steel industry has been undermined by Tory governments for many years.</p> <p>Anyone seeking the truth should look at historic worldwide steel production figures. In the 1970s only three countries produced more steel than the UK. By 2014 we had dropped to 18th place in the world. Many of those overtaking us are emerging economies, as may be expected, but France, Spain and Turkey have also done so. Most importantly, of 20 European countries which make significant amounts of steel, only three have reduced production levels since the 70s and none have cut back more than the UK. And when did this all begin in earnest? In 1980, shortly after Margaret Thatcher came to power. Since then, the UK steel industry has faced many crises and closures. That long-term decline does not apply elsewhere in Europe, because many other governments have supported their major industries, rather than their bankers.<br><strong>Mike Mosley</strong><br><em>Norwich</em></p> <p>\u2022 It appears, from listening to business ministers, that there is no way to save the steel industry because of EU laws. David Cameron has been all over Europe to negotiate staying in the EU. Has he mentioned the plight of the steel industry, which affects other European countries too? I don\u2019t hear it as one of his reforms, nor Eurosceptics making it a reason why we should exit. Cameron is only interested in easy wins. Changing EU law is difficult. Have we asked countries like Germany how they are managing the crisis? What if China flooded the financial services industry? This government is quick to fund new jobs, but slow to protect old jobs in manufacturing industries. So much for the economic competency that gave them a majority. All they seem to have done is kept house prices high, replaced public debt with private in order to claim growth and overseen an unbalanced economy.<br><strong>Graham Ullathorne</strong><br><em>Chesterfield, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a long-standing Labour member I feel frustrated at the party\u2019s lack of response to the steel crisis (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/tata-job-cuts-union-calls-for-government-action\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 19 January). In Labour\u2019s heartlands of Yorkshire and Wales, thousands of jobs are being lost and towns will be economically decimated. There is demand for steel but it needs intervention, which Labour should be busting a gut to facilitate. Instead, there\u2019s endless navel-gazing and talk about issues like Trident and Europe, which are largely hypothetical. Labour has the influence to pull together unions, workers, owners and MPs and come up with creative solutions. Creation of worker-owned steelworks or large cooperatives would incentivise regional businesses to invest and order regionally based steel. Presumably for the Labour leadership, this is not \u201cgreen\u201d manufacturing, in which case get in there and suggest alternatives. Either way, get active and at least visibly speak out in the media.</p> <p>The constant mud-slinging between left and right is tiresome and needs to be replaced with real solutions on the ground so that people can see Labour is working to improve the lives of ordinary working people.

      "bodyText": "Asda is considering cutting more than 1,000 store jobs under plans to close hundreds of staff canteens and shopfloor services such as photo processing units. Managers are understood to have met with union representatives on Wednesday to discuss 4,000 other job moves or changes in stores. The cuts come after Asda revealed plans to axe about 200 jobs at its head office in Leeds earlier this week. Sources said Asda has also given a further 800 or more staff in Leeds and at the headquarters of its George clothing brand in Leicester until Friday to decide if they want to move into new roles as the whole business is streamlined. In the latest round of cutbacks, Asda is considering scrapping canteens which operate in 350 of its 620 stores and eliminating the morning perk of free tea and toast that is handed out to staff in a further 230 outlets. Vending machines in stores may also be under threat, but Asda said it would provide hot drinks machines, fridges and microwaves so that staff can prepare their own food if it goes ahead with closing canteens. The company is also looking at closing or selling off photo-developing services, cutting pharmacy opening hours and reducing customer services, including fresh pizza making and George clothing advice, in an attempt to reduce staff numbers. However, some staff are expected to be redeployed to provide better service in the stores\u2019 core departments, such as fresh groceries. Asda said its intention was to prioritise redeployment over redundancy. An Asda spokesperson said: \u201c2015 was a tough year for UK supermarkets and Asda is no exception. The structure of UK grocery retailing has permanently changed to reflect the way that customers shop today. We know our customers better than anyone else and we need to make sure that our offer meets their changing needs. \u201cWe have entered into a [45-day] consultation with our store colleagues on proposals which we believe will enable us to react more quickly by becoming a leaner and more agile business. These proposals are designed to make our stores easier to shop in and be more effective in delivering the low prices, quality and good value which customers tell us they want.\u201d Asda is battling against the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl which have undermined its position as the UK\u2019s cheapest supermarket. Andy Clarke, its chief executive, has said he wants to halve the price gap with the German chains to 5% over the next two years under his Project Renewal scheme. The Walmart-owned chain has yet to reveal how it performed over Christmas, but data from Kantar Worldpanel last week suggested sales slumped 3.5% in the 12 weeks to 3 January, reducing the grocer\u2019s share of the market by 0.6 percentage points to 16.2%. Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons all performed better than expected, while discounters Aldi and Lidl achieved double-digit sales increases. The latest staff cutbacks come only about 18 months after Asda cut 1,360 middle management jobs in stores, redeploying staff into fast-growing online shopping jobs, part of its attempt to take out \u00a31bn in costs within five years. The proposal to cut staff canteens follows the retailer reducing staff catering facilities across 200 branches less than two years ago. About 350 of the supermarket\u2019s stores currently serve hot breakfasts in staff canteens, while free tea and toast is available in a further 230 supermarkets and Asda Living stores. Asda said it would make fridges and microwaves available for store staff to bring in and prepare their own food and provide hot drink vending machines if it went ahead with closing staff canteens. A spokesperson said: \u201cTo deliver the low prices, quality and good value which customers tell us they want it is necessary to look at the way we operate our business and we are reviewing the viability of providing canteens in our stores. This is not a final decision, we are currently in consultation with our colleagues.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets suffered further heavy losses and crude oil prices continued their unrelenting slide, as world leaders and business chiefs gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Financial markets have had a terrible start to the year, following a bad 2015, and London\u2019s leading index has followed several other major stock markets into bear market territory. The general market rout turned ugly on Wednesday. The FTSE 100 index fell to levels last seen in November 2012, entering the bear market. It ended the day 203 points, or 3.5%, lower at 5673.58, after touching a three-year low of 5639.88. A bear market is defined as a drop of 20% or more from a recent high. London\u2019s leading index has now fallen more than 20% from its record highs in April last year. Worries about China\u2019s economic slowdown and the rest of the global economy along with the plunging price of oil are the main drivers. China\u2019s economy grew by 6.9% last year, its slowest rate in a quarter of a century, data showed on Tuesday. The oil crash sent the Dow Jones nearly 540 points lower, a 3.4% drop, to 15,480.28, pushing it close to bear market territory. US stocks began the year with their worst performance since 2008. The Nasdaq index of US technology stocks was also deep in the red, falling 160 points, or 3.6%, to 4316.16 on Wednesday. Japan\u2019s stock market has joined other bear markets, with the Nikkei closing down 3.7% on Wednesday, leaving it more than 20% below last year\u2019s peak. The Shanghai Composite index entered a bear market last Friday when it recorded its lowest close since December 2014, losing more than 20% from its recent high on 22 December. The other main Chinese stock market, the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index, has been in bear territory for the past six months. In Europe, the French CAC is also in a bear market. It closed down 147.31 points to 4124.95, a 3.5% drop. Another bear, the German Dax, ended the day more than 270 points lower at 9391.64, a 2.8% fall. US oil prices crashed below $27 (\u00a319) for the first time since 2003 after a warning from the world\u2019s top energy watchdog that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d. Venezuela requested an emergency Opec meeting to discuss steps to shore up oil prices, but other delegates dismissed the idea. New York light crude tumbled 5.5% to $26.89 a barrel on Wednesday, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, lost 4.2% to $27.56. A global oil glut has driven prices sharply lower over the past 18 months. Global demand for crude has slumped in the wake of China\u2019s economic slowdown while supply remains high. More Iranian oil is coming in to the market after sanctions were lifted at the weekend, while the Opec oil cartel has been resisting calls to cut output. Oil companies have been badly hit as a result \u2013 Shell warned of a 50% fall in fourth-quarter profits on Wednesday. The slowdown in China \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest consumer of metals \u2013 has prompted a slump in commodities such as iron ore. The world\u2019s biggest mining company, BHP Billiton, forecasts no recovery in iron ore or coal prices over the next few years but hopes for a rebound in copper and oil prices \u201cover the medium term\u201d, it said on Wednesday. The sell-off in Chinese stock markets since last summer, fuelled by fears over the health of China\u2019s economy, has driven copper prices close to six and a half-year lows. The three-month copper contract on the London Metal Exchange lost 1.1% to $4,360 a tonne on Wednesday. Prices remain near their weakest level since May 2009 \u2013 $4,318 \u2013 hit on Friday.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Goldman Sachs\u2019 profit slumped for the third straight quarter as a $5bn settlement of crisis-era legal claims ate into earnings and trading woes impacted profits during a tumultuous three months. Despite the settlement, Goldman Sachs beat analysts\u2019 expectations on Wednesday when it reported that its 2015 net revenue was $33.82bn. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.27bn, down from $7.69bn a year ago. It was, however, more than the $7.07bn that the analysts expected. Analysts also expected the bank to report earnings of about $3.53 a share. Goldman, the last of the big US banks to release fourth quarter earnings, reported a 71.8% fall in net income applicable to common shareholders to $574m, or $1.27 a share, from $2.03bn, or $4.38 a share, a year earlier. Last week, Goldman Sachs said it will pay $5.06bn to resolve civil claims related to the firm\u2019s securitization, underwriting and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007. The bank expected the agreement to reduce fourth quarter earnings by about $1.5bn after tax. The settlement reduced earnings by $3.41 a share. Adjusted earnings were $4.68 a share. Goldman Sachs also announced that it ranked first worldwide in completed mergers and acquisitions for the year. In 2015, it advised on completed transactions valued at more than $1tn. \u201cWe are pleased that our diversified business mix allowed us to deliver solid results in a year characterized by uneven global economic activity,\u201d CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement. \u201cLooking ahead, we believe our strong global client franchise leaves us well positioned to generate superior returns over the long term.\u201d Blankfein\u2019s statement echoed what he had said in October when the bank saw its third quarter revenues fall to $6.86bn from $8.39bn a year ago. At the time, he blamed global market fears for \u201clower levels of activity and declining asset prices\u201d. Goldman, like other banks, had a tough year as oil prices plummeted, concerns about China\u2019s economy intensified, and nervousness about the timing and pace of US interest rate increases weighed on credit markets. The new year has also started on a grim note, with oil prices falling to their lowest level in 13 years and stock prices dropping sharply around the world. Goldman\u2019s revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities (FICC) was $1.12bn, the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2008 during the depths of the financial crisis, during which the firm recorded losses from investments and trading credit products. Bond trading by US banks has been declining since 2009, mainly due to new rules that discourage banks from taking unnecessary risks. To increase its revenue, Goldman has turned to debt financing such as loans and bond underwriting for additional profit, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Reuters contributed to this report.",

It was, however, more than the $7.07bn that the analysts expected.</p> <p>Analysts also expected the bank to report earnings of about $3.53 a share. </p> <p>Goldman, the last of the big US banks to release fourth quarter earnings, reported a 71.8% fall in net income applicable to common shareholders to $574m, or $1.27 a share, from $2.03bn, or $4.38 a share, a year earlier.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/14/goldman-sachs-mortgage-backed-securities-settlement-wall-street\">Goldman Sachs reaches $5bn settlement over mortgage-backed securities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/goldmansachs\">Goldman Sachs</a> said it will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/14/goldman-sachs-mortgage-backed-securities-settlement-wall-street\">pay $5.06bn</a> to resolve civil claims related to the firm\u2019s securitization, underwriting and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007. The bank expected the agreement to reduce fourth quarter earnings by about $1.5bn after tax.</p> <p>The settlement reduced earnings by $3.41 a share. Adjusted earnings were $4.68 a share. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs also announced that it ranked first worldwide in completed mergers and acquisitions for the year. In 2015, it advised on completed transactions valued at more than $1tn.</p> <p>\u201cWe are pleased that our diversified business mix allowed us to deliver solid results in a year characterized by uneven global economic activity,\u201d CEO Lloyd Blankfein <a href=\"http://www.goldmansachs.com/media-relations/press-releases/current/pdfs/2015-q4-results.pdf\">said in a statement</a>. \u201cLooking ahead, we believe our strong global client franchise leaves us well positioned to generate superior returns over the long term.\u201d</p> <p>Blankfein\u2019s statement echoed what he had said in October when the bank saw its third quarter revenues fall to $6.86bn from $8.39bn a year ago. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/15/goldman-sachs-earnings-fall-short-third-quarter\">At the time</a>, he blamed global market fears for \u201clower levels of activity and declining asset prices\u201d. </p> <p>Goldman, like other banks, had a tough year as oil prices plummeted, concerns about China\u2019s economy intensified, and nervousness about the timing and pace of US interest rate increases weighed on credit markets.</p> <p>The new year has also started on a grim note, with oil prices falling to their lowest level in 13 years and stock prices dropping sharply around the world.</p> <p>Goldman\u2019s revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities (FICC) was $1.12bn, the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2008 during the depths of the financial crisis, during which the firm recorded losses from investments and trading credit products.</p> <p>Bond trading by US banks has been declining since 2009, mainly due to new rules that discourage banks from taking unnecessary risks.</p> <p>To increase its revenue, Goldman has turned to debt financing such as loans and bond underwriting for additional profit, the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-turns-to-loans-bond-underwriting-1453199400\">Wall Street Journal</a> reported on Tuesday. </p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report.</em><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "WH Smith\u2019s profits are growing faster than expected after the craze for adult colouring books helped increase sales at the chain\u2019s high street stores over Christmas for the first time in more than 12 years. The company\u2019s shares rose 6% to \u00a316.84 and were the top gainers in the FTSE 350 list of leading companies as it revealed sales at high street stores open a year or more rose 2% in the five weeks to 16 January. Strong sales of stationery, greetings cards and books helped lift sales across the group, including at established shops at hospitals, airports and at other travel hubs, as they rose 2% for the 20 weeks to 16 January. Over the 20-week period, sales rose 5% at established shops at airports and other travel centres, while high street sales were flat. Stephen Clarke, WH Smith\u2019s chief executive, expected profits for the year to be \u201cslightly ahead of plan\u201d as a result of the stronger than expected sales performance. He said sales of what the company calls colour therapy books had been \u201cphenomenal\u201d over Christmas. WH Smith first drew attention to strong sales of the books in October, and Clarke said the festive figures suggested the craze remained in full swing. WH Smith had shrugged off the overall decline in high street shoppers because its customers had spent more per visit, he said, with deals on colouring pens a particular success. Christmas card sales also rose as the group\u2019s Funky Pigeon online and high street business increased trade by 25%. The books market as a whole saw its first year of growth last year since 2007. Clarke said keen readers were now mixing physical books with ebooks. \u201cThe overall physical books market is much more stable,\u201d Clarke said. The biggest seller over the period was the Ladybird for Grown Ups series including The Ladybird Book of the Hipster and How it Works: The Husband. David Walliams\u2019 Grandpa\u2019s Great Escape was another strong title, although Clarke said there was no blockbuster to match Lynda Bellingham\u2019s autobiography in 2014. Both WH Smith\u2019s divisions performed better than expected, and the high street operation\u2019s sales increase over Christmas was the main surprise. The number of shoppers on Britain\u2019s streets and at shopping centres fell, making Christmas trading tough for other retailers such as Poundland and Argos. Clarke said: \u201cI think the consumer is in a better mood than in recent years, but I\u2019d be cautious with that. High street footfall is still down and the categories we are in are still challenging.\u201d He said WH Smith would continue its strategy of building profits as depending on reliable sales growth at established stores was \u201cbonkers\u201d. The figures were a fillip for the retailer after it was criticised for failing to pass on VAT savings at airports to customers. The government has launched a review of tax rules at airports and Clarke said WH Smith was playing an active role in the process. The company pledged to change prices at its hospital branches after being criticised for charging higher prices. The group has also been hounded by the @WHS_Carpet Twitter feed, where people post pictures including images of worn flooring and falling shelves in shops. WH Smith had its best sales since 2002 in the financial year that ended in August, resulting in Clarke receiving a 56% pay rise to \u00a33.97m as a long-term share award paid him \u00a32.6m. He could face shareholder unrest over his pay at next week\u2019s annual meeting. Pirc, the corporate governance adviser, said Clarke\u2019s pay was \u201chighly excessive\u201d and recommended shareholders vote against the company\u2019s remuneration report and policy.",

    "webTitle": "Nestl\u00e9 loses high court battle to trademark shape of KitKat", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nestl\u00e9 has failed in its attempt to trademark the shape of KitKat in the UK, opening the door for rivals to launch copycat products. The high court ruling on Wednesday was the culmination of a long-running legal battle between Nestl\u00e9 and Cadbury that has involved hearings in Britain and courts elsewhere in Europe. Nestl\u00e9 said it would appeal against the decision. It first tried to trademark the shape of the four-fingered chocolate bar in 2010, but its attempts were opposed by Cadbury. The confectioners have been battling over trademarks since Nestl\u00e9 blocked Cadbury\u2019s attempts to trademark the shade of purple used in the packaging of Dairy Milk. The European court of justice previously ruled that the shape of the KitKat was not distinctive enough to merit a trademark and that such a designation would not comply with European law. Mr Justice Arnold had referred the case to the European courts for clarification after beginning the high court hearing in 2014. In his written ruling, the judge said Nestl\u00e9 had not promoted the chocolate bar\u2019s shape as one of its selling points and had distributed it in an opaque wrapping that did not reveal its design. \u201cIn these circumstances it seems likely that consumers rely only on the word mark KitKat and the other word and the pictorial marks used in relation to the goods in order to identify the trade origin of the products. They associate the shape with KitKat (and therefore with Nestl\u00e9), but no more than that,\u201d he said. \u201cTherefore, if it is necessary to show that consumers have come to rely on the shape mark in order to distinguish the trade source of the goods at issue, the claim of acquired distinctiveness fails.\u201d The first KitKat-type bar was sold in Britain by Rowntree &amp; Co in 1935, when it was called Chocolate Crisp, and the shape has changed little since then. Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree in 1998. A lookalike called Kvikk Lunsj, translated as \u201cquick lunch\u201d, launched in Norway in 1937 and is available in some UK shops. After the ruling, a Nestl\u00e9 spokesman said: \u201cKitKat is much loved and the iconic shape of the four-finger bar, which has been used in the UK for more than 80 years, is well known by consumers. \u201cWe believe the shape deserves to be protected as a trademark in the UK and are disappointed that the court did not agree on this occasion. We are taking the necessary steps to appeal this judgment.\u201d Sharon Daboul, a trademark attorney at law firm EIP, said the high court ruling was a \u201ccommon-sense decision\u201d.

The confectioners have been battling over trademarks since Nestl\u00e9 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/04/cadbury-dairy-milk-purple-trademark-blocked\">blocked Cadbury\u2019s attempts</a> to trademark the shade of purple used in the packaging of Dairy Milk.</p> <p>The European court of justice previously ruled that the shape of the KitKat was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/16/kit-kat-unprotected-european-court-rejects-trademark-case\">not distinctive enough to merit a trademark</a> and that such a designation would not comply with European law.</p> <p>Mr Justice Arnold had referred the case to the European courts for clarification after beginning the high court hearing in 2014. In his written ruling, the judge said Nestl\u00e9 had not promoted the chocolate bar\u2019s shape as one of its selling points and had distributed it in an opaque wrapping that did not reveal its design.</p> <p>\u201cIn these circumstances it seems likely that consumers rely only on the word mark KitKat and the other word and the pictorial marks used in relation to the goods in order to identify the trade origin of the products. They associate the shape with KitKat (and therefore with Nestl\u00e9), but no more than that,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTherefore, if it is necessary to show that consumers have come to rely on the shape mark in order to distinguish the trade source of the goods at issue, the claim of acquired distinctiveness fails.\u201d</p> <p>The first KitKat-type bar was sold in Britain by Rowntree &amp; Co in 1935, when it was called Chocolate Crisp, and the shape has changed little since then. Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree in 1998.</p> <p>A lookalike called Kvikk Lunsj, translated as \u201cquick lunch\u201d, launched in Norway in 1937 and is available in some UK shops.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/oct/01/cadbury-dairy-milk-rounded-chunks-chocolate-sweeter\">Cadbury Dairy Milk: why rounded chunks of chocolate taste sweeter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After the ruling, a Nestl\u00e9 spokesman said: \u201cKitKat is much loved and the iconic shape of the four-finger bar, which has been used in the UK for more than 80 years, is well known by consumers.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe the shape deserves to be protected as a trademark in the UK and are disappointed that the court did not agree on this occasion.

The warning, announced during a post-Christmas trading update, is the second time the pub chain disappointed shareholders in a little over two months. Wetherspoon said in November that annual profit was likely to fall because of increased wages. Sales at pubs and bars open a year or more rose 3.3% and total sales increased 6.3% in the 12 weeks to 17 January, it said in the update. Sales growth picked up during the period, but the group\u2019s profit margin shrank after it increased minimum hourly pay 8% in August. Wetherspoon said it expected its operating margin for the six months ending on 24 January to narrow by 1.1 percentage point to 6.3%. Tim Martin, its chairman and founder, said: \u201cAs indicated in our November trading update, increased labour costs will be an important factor in the outcome for this financial year. Our current view is profits for this year are likely to be towards the lower end of analysts\u2019 expectations.\u201d Wetherspoon shares fell more than 10% in early trading on Wednesday and were down 7% to 627p by late morning. It was the biggest faller in the FTSE 250 index of medium-sized companies. Martin said Wetherspoon bumped up wages in August because it needed to compete with restaurants and retailers to attract good staff. He said he did not regret the move and that reduced profit guidance was based on \u201ccrunching through the numbers\u201d in more detail. \u201cIf you look after your staff if definitely works and we\u2019ve proved that over the years. No one has said to me in the company that they wished we hadn\u2019t put pay up. We\u2019ve had quite good sales and our staff are happy. A few shareholders may not be as happy as the staff but that\u2019s something we will have to work on,\u201d he said. Wetherspoon has defied the decline of the pub industry in Britain by charging low prices, serving food and coffee and extending opening hours, but analysts at Numis said the company had little room for manoeuvre on prices or staff costs. The analysts cut their pre-tax profit forecast for the year ending in July by 4% to \u00a372.5m. Profit last year was \u00a377.8m. Wetherspoon said it would probably open fewer pubs than planned this year. It had targeted 15 new pubs but now expected the number to be between 10 and 15. Martin said this was \u201cthe way the cookie crumbles\u201d on planning and licence applications rather than a decision in light of trading figures.",

      "bodyText": "How do you define a bear market? Broadly speaking, it\u2019s a stock market in which the price of equities falls over a sustained period, creating a background of negative sentiment. With investors anticipating further losses they sell stocks, which makes the market fall further. Some people use a more specific definition, which is when the market falls 20% below its peak over the course of at least two months. The most recent example came between October 2007 and March 2009, when many stock markets ended up mired in bear territory amid the global financial crisis. Which markets are in bear territory? The FTSE 100 dipped into a bear market on Wednesday afternoon. Britain\u2019s blue-chip index peaked at 7103 in April last year and has been falling ever since. At about 3.30pm it moved below 5,682, making it teatime for the bears. The FTSE isn\u2019t be alone. Japan\u2019s Nikkei went into bear market territory overnight, joining others including Shanghai, Germany\u2019s DAX, the French Cac 40, Russia\u2019s Micex and the Russell 2000 of small mutual funds. What about a bull market? It might be a while before we see one of these, but essentially bulls are the opposite of bears in that they take a \u201cbullish\u201d, or optimistic, view of the market. This generally follows a trough after a period of pessimism that is suddenly turned on its head. Unlike a bear market, there seems to be no consensus as to how far stocks must rise to be a bull market.",

Some people use a more specific definition, which is when the market falls 20% below its peak over the course of at least two months.</p> <p>The most recent example came between October 2007 and March 2009, when many stock markets ended up mired in bear territory amid the global financial crisis.<br></p> <h2><strong>Which markets are in bear territory?</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/20/ftse-100-heads-closer-to-bear-market-amid-sharp-global-falls\">FTSE 100 dipped into a bear market on Wednesday afternoon</a>. Britain\u2019s blue-chip index peaked at 7103 in April last year and has been falling ever since. At about 3.30pm it moved below 5,682, making it teatime for the bears.<br></p> <p>The FTSE isn\u2019t be alone. <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/asia-markets-steeply-red-nikkei-bear-market-n500101\">Japan\u2019s Nikkei went into bear market territory</a> overnight, joining others including Shanghai, Germany\u2019s DAX, the French Cac 40, Russia\u2019s Micex and the Russell 2000 of small mutual funds.<br></p> <h2><strong>What about a bull market?</strong></h2> <p>It might be a while before we see one of these, but essentially bulls are the opposite of bears in that they take a \u201cbullish\u201d, or optimistic, view of the market. </p> <p>This generally follows a trough after a period of pessimism that is suddenly turned on its head. Unlike a bear market, there seems to be no consensus as to how far stocks must rise to be a bull market.<br></p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The recent influx of refugees into Europe is likely to raise economic growth slightly in the short term \u2013 mainly in Austria, Germany and Sweden \u2013 and could deliver a bigger long-term economic boost to the EU if refugees are well integrated into the job market, according to the International Monetary Fund. The Washington-based organisation described the surge in refugees from Syria and other conflict zones as a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d with important ramifications across the Middle East, Europe and beyond. The number of asylum seekers arriving at EU borders is unparalleled in recent times \u2013 in the first 10 months of last year, 995,000 first-time asylum applications were submitted to EU countries, more than twice the number over the same period in 2014, the 50-page report said. The fund said this is likely to result in a \u201cmodest increase in GDP growth\u201d in the short term, due to higher state spending on housing and benefits for asylum seekers, as well as a boost to the job market from the newcomers. Austria, Germany and Sweden, which have been taking in most of the refugees and have low unemployment rates, will see the biggest economic impact. GDP in the EU as a whole could be lifted by 0.05%, 0.09% and 0.13% in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively. The IMF estimates the largest impact in Austria, with GDP rising by 0.5% by 2017, followed by Sweden (0.4%) and Germany (0.3%). In the long run, the economic impact could be larger, but will depend on the integration of refugees into the labour market. Assuming this is successful, by 2020 the level of GDP could be 0.25% higher for the EU as a whole, and between 0.5% and 1% higher in Germany, Austria and Sweden, the IMF estimates. \u201cRapid labour market integration is key to reducing the net fiscal cost associated with the current inflow of asylum seekers. Indeed, the sooner the refugees gain employment, the more they will help the public finances by paying income tax and social security contributions,\u201d the report said. The authors said government spending on the refugee crisis should be taken into account when looking at fiscal targets, for example, Greece. Confounding widespread fears, the IMF said most immigration studies showed that the effect of new arrivals on domestic workers is usually small, possibly because they are in different segments of the job market or because of a rise in investment in response to a sudden surge in workers. Enrica Detragiache, one of the report\u2019s lead authors, said: \u201cBy and large the negative effects tend to be short-lived and temporary.\u201d She also said the analysis had not found a \u201ctipping point where we say the inflows [of refugees] are so large that the economies cannot accommodate them any more.\u201d Germany\u2019s open-door refugee policy recorded 1.1 million refugees arriving last year, by far the highest number in the EU. Alexander Dobrindt, its transport minister, said this week that Germany must close its borders if the number of new arrivals does not drop soon. The IMF called on EU governments to help refugees into the job market by easing restrictions on taking up work during the asylum application. Other suggestions include wage subsidies to private employers and temporary exceptions to minimum or entry-level wages, as well as startup funds for immigrant entrepreneurs. Reducing restrictions on refugees\u2019 mobility would allow them to move to where there is a high demand for workers, the IMF said. It raised the possibility that the most recent wave of asylum seekers are better educated than those in the past, with 21% of Syrians who arrived in Germany in 2013-14 having post-secondary education, close to the German average (23%). When asked about whether the recent arrivals will be able to fill skill gaps in Germany, Detragiache cautioned: \u201cIt would be naive to think that the refugees at the moment have those particular skills. The challenge is to provide the type of training that is required and that will take some time.\u201d The IMF noted that the Swedish introduction programme, which includes language training, employment preparation and basic knowledge of Swedish society, has helped refugees achieve high rates of employment, although it is a lengthy process. Germany has a higher share of foreign-born population than the UK or the US after previous immigration waves in the 1960s and 1990s, the report noted. While the gap narrows over time, in the long run the unemployment rate remains 3 percentage points higher among immigrants.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Leonardo DiCaprio has launched a ferocious attack on the greed of the world\u2019s energy industry at the World Economic Forum in Davos. DiCaprio used an awards ceremony to demand more action on climate change, decrying those who deny it is a problem. And he insisted fossil fuels must be kept in the ground \u2013 backing a campaign launched by the Guardian last year. After picking up a crystal award for his work on environmentalism, the actor explained he had seen the devastation caused by climate change firsthand, from melting glaciers in the Arctic to farmers whose crops had been washed away. DiCaprio is tipped for Oscar success this year for his role in the bleak and gritty drama The Revenant. And he gave energy bosses a similar savaging. In front of world leaders, business chiefs and campaigners, DiCaprio said: We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries to determine the future of humanity. Those entities with a financial interest in preserving this destructive system have denied, and even covered up the evidence of our changing climate. Enough is enough. You know better. The world knows better. History will place the blame for this devastation squarely at their feet.\u201d The solution to limiting global warming, he added, is to leave oil, gas and coal reserves alone: Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. Twenty years ago, we described this problem as an addiction. Today, we possess the means to end this reliance.\u201d DiCaprio also announced that his foundation was making $15m of fresh grants to support environmental protection.

And he gave energy bosses a similar savaging.</p> <p>In front of world leaders, business chiefs and campaigners, DiCaprio said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries to determine the future of humanity.

The world knows better. History will place the blame for this devastation squarely at their feet.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>The solution to limiting global warming, he added, is to leave oil, gas and coal reserves alone:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. Twenty years ago, we described this problem as an addiction. Today, we possess the means to end this reliance.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>DiCaprio also announced that his foundation was making $15m of fresh grants to support environmental protection.

      "bodyText": "Shell has warned that profits in the fourth quarter may be 50% lower than a year earlier, with write-offs for 2015 as high as $7bn (\u00a35bn). Underlining the damage being inflicted on the industry by low crude prices, it said on Wednesday it expected earnings to come in at between $1.6bn and $1.9bn and full-year numbers as low as $10.4bn. Shell is first of the large oil companies to report preliminary results for 2015. Shares in the company dived a further 7%, to \u00a312.71, ramping up the pressure on its chief executive, Ben van Beurden, who is trying to justify a \u00a335bn takeover of rival BG that must be agreed by more than 50% of Shell shareholders next week. Van Beurden insisted he was pleased with his company\u2019s operating performance in 2015 and the momentum to reduce costs and improve competitiveness. He also expressed confidence that shareholders would back the BG deal, saying: \u201cBold, strategic moves shape our industry. The completion of the BG transaction, which we are expecting in a matter of weeks, will mark the start of a new chapter in Shell, to rejuvenate the company, and improve shareholder returns.\u201d The merger was originally proposed when global crude prices were at $55 a barrel. They have since fallen below $28, driven down this week by expectations of even more oil coming into the market after nuclear sanctions were dropped by the west against Iran. As oil prices hit a 12-year low on Wednesday, Shell downgraded the value of its North Sea reserves and said it would take other one-off losses which could be as high as $7bn for the full financial year. In a separate announcement, BG said it would be reporting 2015 earnings of $2.3bn, a significant bounce back after losses in the previous year. \u201cOur excellent operational performance in 2015 is expected to deliver results in line with, or ahead of, our guidance for the year,\u201d said its chief executive, Helge Lund, who will leave if the deal with Shell goes through. Oil analysts at the investment bank Barclays Capital said the strong figures from BG should swing Shell investors behind the merger: \u201cThe most positive feature from the update this morning was from BG with full-year production above the upper end of guidance and net cash flow 11% ahead of our estimate. \u201cThis goes some way to help justify the timing of Shell\u2019s proposed acquisition of BG and should in our view help firm up the likelihood of shareholders voting in favour of the deal next week.\u201d Shell, which reports its formal quarterly financial figures on 4 February, has been cutting jobs and spending over the past two years since Van Beurden arrived but has been running to catch up as global oil prices have plunged from highs of $115 in the summer of 2014. Earlier this week the company ditched plans to jointly develop a gasfield in Abu Dhabi, which some analysts said could have been worth up to $10bn. It has already backed away from other high-cost schemes, including its controversial drilling in the Alaskan Arctic. The International Energy Agency, which advises countries on energy policy, warned on Tuesday that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d and predicted the global glut would continue for at least most of the year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Asia Pacific stock markets have been pummelled as investors took fright at a continued slide in oil prices and mounting bearish sentiment about the global economy. After the International Energy Agency warned that the oil market could \u201cdrown in oversupply\u201d, US crude prices plunged below $28 a barrel on Wednesday to hit its lowest point since 2003. The more widely traded London benchmark Brent crude, which dipped below $28 briefly on Monday, lost 24c to $28.52 a barrel. Equity markets in Asia reacted by surrendering gains from the previous session amid bleak predictions from delegates gathering for the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland. European markets were set to fall sharply when trading opened later on Wednesday with the FTSE100 in London set to fall more than 100 points, according to futures trading. \u201cThe wheels look like they are coming off in the Asian session today. The stabilisation we saw yesterday now appears to have only been a pause,\u201d said Angus Nicholson of online trading firm IG, adding that the outlook in Chinese markets was \u201ckilling sentiment\u201d. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sank 2.1% to reach depths not seen since late 2011. Japan\u2019s Nikkei closed down 3.7%, leaving it more than 20% below last year\u2019s peak and into the technical definition of a bear market. The pain was felt widely. Stocks in Australia closed down 1.3% with the Asia-focused bank, ANZ, down 4.5% and the country\u2019s huge resources and energy sectors also being punished. In South Korea, the Kospi index was off 2.34%. Chinese mainland markets fared only a little better amid mounting talk that more stimulus may be on the way, possibly before the lunar new year holidays in early February. The CSI300 index of leading shares was down 1.4% and the Shanghai Composite was off 1%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index, however, endured a much worse day, shedding 3.75%. The index has lost more than one-third of its value since April 2015. The China government-backed China Securities Journal reported that Beijing had the policy space for further easing to support the economy, including raising deficit spending to around 3% of annual economic output. China\u2019s central bank revealed late on Tuesday that it would inject more than 600bn yuan ($91.22bn) into the banking system to help ease a liquidity squeeze expected before the long new year celebrations. However, such a move was usual before the holidays and stopped well short of an actual cut in bank reserve ratios. Chinese has cut interest rates six times since November 2014 as part of a range of measures designed to bolster flagging growth. Wall Street saw its early gains erased by the slump in US crude. The Dow ended Tuesday up 0.17%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose a single point and the Nasdaq eased 0.26%. The falls in Asia come as business leaders and policymakers gather in Davos , where two-thirds of chief executives saw more threats to their businesses than three years ago according to a PwC survey. On the eve of the meeting, William White, chairman of the OECD\u2019s review committee and former chief economist of the Bank for International Settlements, said that the problems building in the global financial system were now \u201cworse than it was in 2007\u201d and warned that central bankers had \u201cused up all their ammunition\u201d. \u201cDebts have continued to build up over the last eight years and they have reached such levels in every part of the world that they have become a potent cause for mischief,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph in London. \u201cIt will become obvious in the next recession that many of these debts will never be serviced or repaid, and this will be uncomfortable for a lot of people who think they own assets that are worth something.\u201d Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets, noted that polls of investors showed investors were more bearish on Wall Street than at any time since mid-1987. \u201cPerhaps characterising the recent bout of negativity as being \u2018pervasive\u2019 is an understatement,\u201d he wrote in a note.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Christopher Pyne has written a \u201cletter of support\u201d for a Belgian automotive entrepreneur who is trying to buy GM Holden\u2019s South Australia plant and confirmed the project would be eligible for the government\u2019s car-making subsidy scheme. The acquisition would mean the Adelaide suburb of Elizabeth continue producing Commodores, saving more than 1,000 jobs and the future of the Australian-made car. The businessman, Guido Dumarey, of Punch International, says there was an immediate change in attitude towards the project after Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister, with the South Australian Pyne as his industry minister. Pyne said on Wednesday the government would provide ongoing car-industry subsidies to save the Elizabeth plant, continuing the backtracking from the Abbott government\u2019s initial determination to end industry payments, potentially providing a major \u201cgood news\u201d announcement in South Australia in an election year but eating into already-booked budget savings. The plant is scheduled to close late next year after the Abbott government\u2019s end to \u201cindustry welfare\u201d saw all three remaining car-makers announce they were quitting Australia. The bid by Dumarey, of Punch International, would require unspecified continued government funding from the $800m Automotive Transformation Scheme, much of which has been booked in the budget as a saving even though the fund is legislated to run until 2021. Dumarey has indicated he would invest at least $150m in the project and would like to reach an agreement with GM by mid-year. \u201cThe scheme is legislated to continue until 2021 and right now I am working with Punch Corporation, a guy called Guido Dumarey, who is talking to GM in Detroit about how he might be able to take over the operations in Elizabeth, and if that comes to fruition which would be terrific but it\u2019s in the very early stages ... they would expect to create at least 30,000 units a year and if they do that they will be able to access the ATS. So the scheme is not closing ... if there is another car manufacturer accessing it it will continue,\u201d he told local radio 5AA. A spokesman for GM Holden said the deal would be \u201cevaluated on its merits\u201d. Dumarey has had talks with GM on the sidelines of the Detroit Motor Show, currently underway, armed with the letter of support from Pyne. Punch International already has an automotive transmission plant in Strasbourg, France, which was also a former GM plant and had been slated for closure when Dumarey took it over. Its workforce has since increased. He said the five years it took him to buy the Strasbourg plant from GM had taught him that it was absolutely essential to get government onside to successfully prosecute deals like this. Dumarey has visited Australia several times, most recently in the days before Christmas, when he met Pyne, Labor industry spokesman senator Kim Carr and South Australian independent senator Nick Xenophon. He is due to visit again within weeks. Carr and Xenophon have been working for months behind the scenes to try to help the bid and save the manufacturing jobs. Xenophon said Pyne had been \u201creceptive and helpful\u201d to the project and while the \u201cshape and structure\u201d of the deal needed to be examined, it was \u201cin the national interest..and absolutely worth the cost of continued ATS subsidies\u201d. Carr said he believed GM was taking the bid seriously, but it would definitely require subsidies from the existing government scheme. \u201cIt is my understanding GM is giving this matter careful consideration. The business case will have to stack up and there is no doubt the company will require access to the ATS, which is legislated to run to 2021,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is a project of enormous potential for Australia and for the jobs of thousands of Australia. It reinforces my view that with the right government policies we can attract new investment to Australian car manufacturing.\u201d He said he would do everything he could to work with the government to help the project succeed. In a video interview late last year published by Motoring.com.au, Dumarey said the change of prime ministership in Australia had meant a change in attitude from the Australian government towards his bid. \u201cI think there is a complete new wave in the last month after the change of prime minister, the politics from Mr Abbott is different from the politics of today,\u201d he said, adding he was asking Australians to \u201cjudge me on the result and give me a fair go, that\u2019s it\u201d. Dumarey has been looking at the Elizabeth plant since 2014 and had several meetings with the Abbott government about the plan \u2013 which he has dubbed Project Erich \u2013 but it is understood they showed little interest. He believes he can develop premium rear and all-wheel drive cars and using the Commodore\u2019s Zeta architecture, as well as continue producing the Commodore utility, for the domestic and overseas markets. The government originally planned to save $800m from the ATS as the car industry prepared to close and the Coalition declared the \u201cage of industry entitlement\u2019 to be over. But last year year it partially reversed that decision, budgeting to spend $105m to continue assistance to components makers, while diverting the rest back into Treasury coffers. At that time the government reversed a decision to repeal the ATS legislation. Continuing ATS payments for cars made by Punch in South Australia would force it to reverse some of the budget savings. Abbott\u2019s unpopularity, the looming end of car manufacturing and uncertainty over the future submarines project were causing huge problems for the South Australian Liberals. Under Abbott polling suggested they faced the loss of three seats, Pyne\u2019s seat of Sturt, Mayo, held by Jamie Briggs who resigned from the ministry earlier this month over inappropriate behaviour on an overseas trip and Hindmarsh, held by Matt Williams. The Coalition was deeply concerned about the impact of independent Nick Xenophon\u2019s decision to stand candidates in lower house seats. Although the polling in the state has improved significantly under Malcolm Turnbull, leaked texts published by the Australian revealed that even after the change in prime ministership Pyne was asking a high-profile local radio announcer to convince Xenophon not to run a candidate against him in Sturt. Xenophon has now announced a candidate.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The crisis engulfing British steelmakers has deepened, after Sheffield Forgemasters unveiled plans to cut up to 100 jobs. The proposal prompted fresh criticism of the government\u2019s response to the steel industry\u2019s decline, just a day after Tata Steel announced plans to cut 1,050 jobs. In a statement, the company said it would consult on \u201cup to 100 redundancies across all its divisions\u201d. Founded in 1805, Sheffield Forgemasters has nearly 800 staff. Chairman Tony Pedder said: \u201cThe storm clouds which seem to gather periodically over the steel and steel-related sectors are once again evident.\u201d Sheffield Forgemasters, a private company which makes parts for the submarines carrying the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear weapons, has also reported its first ever loss, of \u00a39.4m, for the 18 months to the end of 2014. The fresh blow to British steelmaking, which has shed 5,000 jobs since last summer, comes with the industry battling an array of problems. These include high energy prices, the strong pound and alleged \u201cdumping\u201d of cheap steel in the EU by firms from China, where demand has slumped amid an economic slowdown. But industry figures said the government had not done enough to help shore up steelmaking against the difficult conditions facing the industry. \u201cThese significant job losses for the company highlight that there isn\u2019t an area of steel that is off limits to the mix of extreme pressures the sector is facing.\u201d said Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel. He said it was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d that a new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point will not be mandated to use British steel. \u201cGovernment cannot afford to let up on ensuring that all major procurement projects, from nuclear sites to tidal barrages and airports, all use British steel,\u201d he said. He also criticised the government for failing to prevent China from allegedly dumping large amounts of steel in the EU because of a slump in demand in the cooling Chinese economy. \u201cGovernment is wrong to say there is nothing that they can do about price of steel \u2013 a major cause of problem is Chinese dumping,\u201d said Stace. \u201cA concerted effort by government working in Brussels and Beijing can even now have a critical and positive impact.\u201d Sheffield Forgemasters chief executive Dr Graham Honeyman also appeared to blame the government for not doing enough. \u201cUnder normal trading conditions, we believe we can compete with our global competitors,\u201d said Honeyman. \u201cBut when the circumstances we face are so adverse, despite being a fiercely independent company, we have felt compelled, along with others in our sector, to have to canvass action from government to look at ways they might take urgent measures to regularise the competitive and market environment for UK manufacturers.\u201d He said that while the government had taken steps to reduce energy costs for steelmakers \u201cmore remains to be done\u201d. \u201cIt is unfortunate that we have had to announce redundancy plans, but these are to preserve the majority of jobs here in Sheffield and are very much viewed as a short-term necessity. \u201cWe anticipate retirements and voluntary redundancies will make up part of the process with an emphasis on relocation within the company where applicable.\u201d",

Founded in 1805, Sheffield Forgemasters has nearly 800 staff.</p> <p>Chairman Tony Pedder said: \u201cThe storm clouds which seem to gather periodically over the steel and steel-related sectors are once again evident.\u201d</p> <p>Sheffield Forgemasters, a private company which makes parts for the submarines carrying the UK\u2019s Trident nuclear weapons, has also reported its first ever loss, of \u00a39.4m, for the 18 months to the end of 2014.</p> <p>The fresh blow to British steelmaking, which has shed 5,000 jobs since last summer, comes with the industry battling an array of problems.<br></p> <p>These include high energy prices, the strong pound and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2016/jan/18/only-stiff-tariffs-on-chinese-steel-will-reinforce-uk-producers\">alleged \u201cdumping\u201d of cheap steel</a> in the EU by firms from China, where demand has slumped amid an economic slowdown.</p> <p>But industry figures said the government had not done enough to help shore up steelmaking against the difficult conditions facing the industry.</p> <p>\u201cThese significant job losses for the company highlight that there isn\u2019t an area of steel that is off limits to the mix of extreme pressures the sector is facing.\u201d said Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f069cdc5fb39125779b7441b92eb3ba5e181e792\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f069cdc5fb39125779b7441b92eb3ba5e181e792/0_194_3000_1803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sun rises behind the Tata steelworks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sun rises behind the Tata steelworks in Port Talbot, Wales.
