      "bodyText": "The board of Standard Chartered last night issued a statement backing its chief executive and chairman ahead of a board meeting in Singapore on Tuesday that comes in the wake of last week\u2019s profits warning and a new investigation by US regulators. The statement endorsing Peter Sands and Sir John Peace came after another difficult week for the emerging markets focused bank, which has now endured a 30% share in its fall price since the start of the year. The warning over profits on Tuesday was quickly followed by reports that US regulators \u2013 which fined the bank \u00a3400m in 2012 for breaching sanctions \u2013 were again investigating the bank. The shares \u2013 already at a five-and-a-half year low\u2013 fell again on Friday despite rallies by the other banks which were bolstered by a statement from the Bank of England about capital that was less draconian than feared. The Financial Times quoted a letter from Woodside Holdings Investment Management saying Sands had \u201cfailed his shareholders\u201d. It is the second time the board has issued a statement backing the pair; a similar endorsement was made in July after it was reported that the chairman was beginning plans to find a successor to Sands, one of the few bank bosses to have held on to their job since the crisis. The board meeting in Singapore had already been scheduled before the news of a latest investigation by US regulators and is taking place ahead of a crucial three-day presentation to be held in Hong Kong in a fortnight\u2019s time. Then Sands will attempt to calm concerns about the bank\u2019s capital position and bad debts and set out how he intends to cut out $400m of costs. In a statement, the bank said: \u201cThe board is united in its support of both Peter Sands and Sir John Peace, and the management team, to deliver the refreshed strategy, restore the bank to profitable growth and deliver returns for our shareholders. \u201cWe are taking action to position ourselves for growth and the enormous opportunities our markets present.

Industry representatives said the decision was surprising and disappointing, and warned that it could mean fare rises to cover the liability, with thousands of passengers set to launch claims for delayed flights.

    "webTitle": "Eurozone inflation edges up \u2013 but not enough to ease concerns about deflation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Eurozone inflation edged slightly higher in October but economists warned it would provide little relief for policymakers attempting to ward off deflation in the single currency bloc. Annual inflation increased to 0.4% from 0.3% in September according to a first estimate by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, remaining well below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of close to, but below, 2%. It was nudged up by higher prices in the services sector, higher food, alcohol and tobacco prices, and a smaller fall in energy prices compared with September. But core inflation, which strips out volatile items including energy and food, fell to 0.7% in October from 0.8% in September. Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, said the slight rise in headline inflation did little to take the pressure off policymakers at the European Central Bank (ECB). \u201cThe low core inflation reading for October will reinforce concerns about deflationary risks in the eurozone and hence keeps pressure on the ECB to take further stimulative action. \u201cGiven the recent, sharp drop in commodity prices, we do not expect the food and energy component to provide further upward pressure to the headline rate in coming months \u2013 if anything, renewed downward pressure may be in the pipeline. Against this backdrop and with eurozone economic growth lacklustre, the ECB will likely remain under pressure to do more to steer inflation back to their target.\u201d The ECB has taken action in recent months to breathe some life back into the flagging eurozone economy and prevent a damaging deflationary spiral, where businesses and consumers put off purchases with the expectation that prices will fall further. However, the central bank has so far stopped short of creating money to make large-scale purchases of government bonds. Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg, said: \u201cThe latest economic rough patch may further delay the long-expected gradual rebound in inflation and will probably trigger more discussions about further easing at the upcoming meetings.\u201d The eurozone unemployment rate was unchanged at 11.5% in September, a separate report from Eurostat showed. The number of people out of work fell by 19,000 over the month, to 18.35m. Germany had the lowest jobless rate at 5%, while Greece and Spain had the highest rates at 26.4% and 24% respectively. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said despite the drop in the number of unemployed people in September, unemployment fell at a slower rate in the third quarter than the second. \u201cEurozone unemployment continued to fall in September, but there are hints that recent stuttering economic activity and more fragile business confidence has temporarily at least slowed already very limited improvement in labour markets,\u201d he said. The eurozone economy failed to grow in the second quarter, while German GDP shrank by 0.2%, raising the prospect of a technical recession if Europe\u2019s largest economy contracts in the third quarter. Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising group WPP, said Germany and much of the rest of Western Europe were challenging markets. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough for Germany. Western continental Europe is not a pretty place at the moment,\u201d he said, as WPP gave a trading update. As the eurozone is easing monetary policy to ward off deflation, Russia\u2019s central bank raised its key interest rate to 9.5% from 8% in an attempt to address a sliding rouble and tackle inflation.",

      "body": "<p>Eurozone inflation edged slightly higher in October but economists warned it would provide little relief for policymakers attempting to ward off deflation in the single currency bloc.</p> <p>Annual inflation increased to 0.4% from 0.3% in September according to a first estimate by Eurostat, the EU statistics agency, remaining well below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of close to, but below, 2%. It was nudged up by higher prices in the services sector, higher food, alcohol and tobacco prices, and a smaller fall in energy prices compared with September.</p> <p>But core inflation, which strips out volatile items including energy and food, fell to 0.7% in October from 0.8% in September.</p> <p>Martin van Vliet, economist at ING, said the slight rise in headline inflation did little to take the pressure off policymakers at the European Central Bank (ECB). \u201cThe low core inflation reading for October will reinforce concerns about deflationary risks in the eurozone and hence keeps pressure on the ECB to take further stimulative action.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the recent, sharp drop in commodity prices, we do not expect the food and energy component to provide further upward pressure to the headline rate in coming months \u2013 if anything, renewed downward pressure may be in the pipeline. Against this backdrop and with eurozone economic growth lacklustre, the ECB will likely remain under pressure to do more to steer inflation back to their target.\u201d</p> <p>The ECB has taken action in recent months to breathe some life back into the flagging eurozone economy and prevent a damaging deflationary spiral, where businesses and consumers put off purchases with the expectation that prices will fall further.</p> <p>However, the central bank has so far stopped short of creating money to make large-scale purchases of government bonds.</p> <p>Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg, said: \u201cThe latest economic rough patch may further delay the long-expected gradual rebound in inflation and will probably trigger more discussions about further easing at the upcoming meetings.\u201d</p> <p>The eurozone unemployment rate was unchanged at 11.5% in September, a separate report from Eurostat showed. The number of people out of work fell by 19,000 over the month, to 18.35m.</p> <p>Germany had the lowest jobless rate at 5%, while Greece and Spain had the highest rates at 26.4% and 24% respectively.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said despite the drop in the number of unemployed people in September, unemployment fell at a slower rate in the third quarter than the second. \u201cEurozone unemployment continued to fall in September, but there are hints that recent stuttering economic activity and more fragile business confidence has temporarily at least slowed already very limited improvement in labour markets,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The eurozone economy failed to grow in the second quarter, while German GDP shrank by 0.2%, raising the prospect of a technical recession if Europe\u2019s largest economy contracts in the third quarter.</p> <p>Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising group WPP, said Germany and much of the rest of Western Europe were challenging markets. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough for Germany.

      "bodyText": "Days after the US Federal Reserve ended its QE programme, Japan stepped in and sent markets soaring by increasing its own bond buying plans, writes Nick Fletcher. So just a couple of weeks after markets were tanking on fears of a global economic slowdown, political tensions and fears of the spread of Ebola, a difficult month has ended on a positive note. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 82.92 points or 1.28% higher at 6546.47 Germany\u2019s Dax added 2.33% to 9326.87 France\u2019s Cac closed 2.22% better at 4233.09 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 3.07% to 19,783.99 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 2.09% higher at 10,477.8 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 172 points or 1% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up the blog for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, have a good weekend and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. Shares in Barclays have jumped nearly 8% to 239.9p and Royal Bank of Scotland has risen more than 6% to 388.6p after the Bank of England imposed less stringent requirements on how much capital banks must hold compared to their outstanding loans. My colleague Jill Treanor reports: George Osborne is calling on the Bank of England to consider the impact on lending to business and households as it toughens the regime to bolster the financial strength of the banking sector. The Bank of England wants major banks to be subjected to a regulatory regime intended to prevent them hiding the risks they are taking when granting loans to households and business. In a much-anticipated announcement, the Bank of England is requiring the biggest banks to hold 3p of capital for every \u00a31 they lend out by imposing a 3% leverage ratio across the industry almost immediately. The leverage ratio \u2013 a way of measuring the financial strength of banks \u2013 does not allow banks to make assessments about the risks they face, unlike the capital ratios which allow an assessment of risk to be made. Threadneedle Street\u2019s financial policy committee will consult next year to impose an even higher leverage ratio on the biggest banks \u2013 such as Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland \u2013 which could push the level up to just above 4% from 2016. George Osborne, who had asked the FPC to conduct the review, said that he \u201cfully accepts\u201d the logic for an extra component to be added to the 3% level. But he said more work needed to be done on understanding what the impact might be on banks and large building societies. The full story is here: George Osborne questions impact of regulations from Bank of England Time for a recap, after a rather busier Friday than usual.... World stock markets have surged after the Bank of Japan raised its monetary stimulus programme in a new attempt to drive inflation upwards. Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda warned that Japan has reached a \u2018critical moment\u2019 in its battle against deflation, after announcing that the BoJ will broaden the monetary base by 80 trillion yen per year. The BoJ will also triple the amount of exchange traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts it buys, and also buy more long-term Japanese government debt (the FT has a nice summary). The promise of more monetary stimulus has cheered investors around the globe. Europe\u2019s indices are all sharply higher this afternoon, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei earlier leapt by almost 5% to its highest level in seven years. And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones index has hit a new record intraday high in early trading. The move has also driven the yen down to seven year lows against the US dollar -- it has just hit the \u00a5112 to the $1 mark. Economists Sean Richards says the BoJ will welcome that move: Jens Nordvig of Nomura says Japan\u2019s move could calm fears that global central banks are \u201cgetting behind the curve\u201d. He adds: The BoJ is clearly showing the way in terms of proactive and bold monetary policy. The reaction in global risk assets illustrates that central banks still have considerable power to impact asset prices. On this front, the ball is now in the European Central Bank\u2019s court. The question is whether political constraints can be tamed, to send a bold signal in the Eurozone too. And this chart shows how the BoJ\u2019s stimulus measures have outpaced those of the ECB: But the strengthening dollar has helped to push the gold price down to a new four-year low. Here\u2019s our full story: Bank of Japan to inject 80 trillion yen into its economy In other news... The eurozone has moved a little further away from deflation, with the official \u2018flash\u2019 inflation reading rising to 0.4%, from 0.3% in September. Core inflation has fallen, though. And there\u2019s no improvement in the labour market -- the unemployment rate remains at 11.5%, and rose to 12.6% in Italy. Russia has surprised the markets by hiking interest rate from 8% to 9.5%. But the move has not provided much support to the ruble, which has weakened against the US dollar again today. Canada\u2019s economy has shrunk, with GDP falling 0.1% in August The UK has announced plans to recall and payoff some of its first world war debt.....and look who\u2019s been tweeting about it: Royal Bank of Scotland has set aside \u00a3400m to cover likely fines for foreign-exchange rigging, and also revealed that it plans to shut over 150 branches: Royal Bank of Scotland earmarks 5% of branches for closure And shares in fashion retailer Supergroup are down 8% this afternoon after it warned that profits won\u2019t meet expectations, as the warm weather deters people from buying new clothes.... DING DING goes the Wall Street opening bell....and the Dow Jones industrial average has soared to a new all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 is on track to hit its highest closing level ever. Japan\u2019s decision to expand its stimulus programme (see opening post onwards for details and reaction) is cheering investors, helping ease the hangover caused by the end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s QE programme on Wednesday. Wall Street is following the lead set by Europe this morning, and the 4.8% surge on the Japanese Nikkei overnight. As David Madden of IG puts it: The Japanese central bank has taken the QE baton from the Fed and equity traders couldn\u2019t be happier. Canada\u2019s economy has posted its first monthly contraction since the end of 2013, in a worrying signal for the G7 economy. Canadian GDP shrank by 0.1% in August, according to data just released, following an unchanged reading in July. It\u2019s due to a 2.5% drop in oil and gas extraction; alongside falls in manufacturing and construction output. US economic data on the wires.... and it shows a surprise fall in spending, and a weaker-than-expected rise in earnings. Personal spending fell by 0.2% month-on-month in September, the first drop since January (economists expected a 0.1% rise) And personal income rose by just 0.2%, the smallest rise since December 2013 (economists expected a 0.3% rise). Bad news for gold bugs (again) - the spot price of gold has hit a new four-year low of $1,162 per ounce. Japan\u2019s stimulus boost is helping to drive money out of gold and into equities. In other news.. the UK is to redeem some of its legacy debt that helped to finance the first world war. The Treasury announced this morning that it has decided to redeem \u00a3218m of war debt. It is also considering repaying \u00a32bn of war debt, as the recent falls in UK borrowing costs make it a profitable move. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: \u201c4% consols\u201d was issued in 1927 by Winston Churchill, then chancellor, to refinance national war bonds originating from the first world war. The Debt Management Office estimates that the nation has paid \u00a31.26bn in interest on these bonds since 1927. The national war bonds, which paid out a rate of interest of 5% initially (cut to 3.5% in 1932), were issued in 1917 as the government sought to raise more money to finance the ongoing cost of the first world war, which started with the issue of the first war loan in November 1914. The bonds were sold to private investors in 1917 with the advertisement: \u201cIf you cannot fight, you can help your country by investing all you can in 5 per cent Exchequer Bonds ... Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk.\u201d These consols also include some debts dating back to the Crimea War, and losses incurred during the South Sea Bubble. More here: UK bonds that financed first world war to be redeemed 100 years later ITV News\u2019s Joel Hills has blogged about the plan - here\u2019s a flavour: In value terms the bulk of Britain\u2019s First World War bonds are held by big City institutions, but over 100,000 War Bonds are worth less than \u00a31,000 and are held by ordinary members of the public. In many cases these bonds will have been passed down through the generations. Their value has been slowly eroded by inflation (\u00a3100 in 1914 is worth around \u00a33,000 now) and the returns today are almost derisory (a War Bond of \u00a3100 pays out \u00a33.50 in annual interest). But I imagine the sentimental value is immense. Advertising group WPP has warned that the eurozone economy remains tough. WPP CEO Martin Sorrell said this morning: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough for Germany. Western continental Europe is not a pretty place at the moment.\u201d He said he was \u201cbullish\u201d about China, WPP\u2019s third-largest business, but warned: \u201cIf China sneezes we all catch a cold.\u201d In the third quarter, the spread of Ebola in west Africa, the rise of Isis in the Middle East and the pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong posed the greatest challenges, he said, eclipsing the Ukraine crisis which had worried people most in the second quarter. (with thanks to my colleague Julia Kollewe) Japan\u2019s new stimulus plan is expected to send shares higher on Wall Street, when trading begins in two hours time... Russia\u2019s surprisingly big rate hike hasn\u2019t impressed the currency markets much -- the ruble is still down against the US dollar today, at 42.22 rubles to the $. NEWS FROM MOSCOW: the Russian central bank has hiked interest rates sharply, from 8% to 9.5%. That\u2019s a rather more aggressive hike than expected -- traders had anticipate a 50bp rise, to 8.5%. The Russian Central Bank says it took the decision in response to Russia\u2019s high inflation rates, which is likely exceed 8% early next year. But it also warned that Russia\u2019s economy is unlikely to grow much, at all, over the next six months -- even before today\u2019s rate hike. RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK SAYS THAT BY THE END OF Q1 2015 INFLATION WILL RUN AT OVER 8% RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK SAYS THAT IF EXTERNAL CONDITIONS AND INFLATION EXPECTATIONS EASE, BANK READY TO SOFTEN POLICY RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK SAYS INFLATION ON OCT 27 AT 8.4% Y/Y RUSSIAN CENTRAL BANK SAYS THAT ECON GROWTH IN Q4 2014 AND Q1 2015 WILL BE CLOSE TO ZERO Mario Draghi should put the party balloons back in the drawer. Although the headline eurozone inflation rate has risen to 0.4%, the \u2018core\u2019 inflation (stripping out volatile components such as food and energy) has fallen to 0.7% from 0.8%. Analysts at ING say that\u2019s a worrying sign: Today\u2019s eurozone unemployment report confirms that there are still huge differences in labour markets across the single currency region. Eurostat reports that the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Germany (5.0%) and Austria (5.1%). The highest rates, as usual, were seen in Greece (26.4% in July 2014) and Spain (24.0%). The rise in Italy\u2019s jobless rate, to 12.6%, helped to dash hopes that the eurozone averae would fall from 11.5%. The scale of Europe\u2019s jobless crisis remains stark. There are 24.512 million men and women out of work across the EU, with 18.347m based in the euro area. There has been some progress in the last year -- since September 2013 the unemployment rate has fallen in twenty-one Member States, increased in six and remained stable in Belgium. Eurostat says: The largest decreases were registered in Hungary (10.0% to 7.6% between August 2013 and August 2014), Spain (26.1% to 24.0%) and Portugal (15.7% to 13.6%), and the highest increases were registered in Finland (8.2% to 8.7%) and France (10.3% to 10.5%). So, why did eurozone inflation rise (slightly) this month to 0.4%? Eurostat reports that service sector prices rose by 1.2% annually in October (not September as I mistyped initially), up from 1.1% the previous month. Food, alcohol and tobacco prices also rose at a faster pace -- +0.5% this month, up from 0.3% in September. And the drop in energy prices has eased, to -1.8% year-on-year, from -2.3% a month earlier. This rise in inflation will be welcomed in the European Central Bank, but it is still well below the ECB\u2019s target of almost 2%. (larger versions of these charts are online here) Today\u2019s rise in eurozone inflation shows that the region will avoid full-blown deflation, reckons Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole. Eurozone inflation has risen, slightly, but remains uncomfortably low. The euro area consumer prices index inched up to 0.4% in October, up from 0.3% in September. BREAKING: The eurozone unemployment rate was stable in September at 11.5%, unchanged compared to August. Back to the main story of the morning (so far....), Japan boosting its stimulus programme. J.P. Morgan Asset Management Chief Investment Officer for Fixed Income, Nick Gartside, says the move shows that the days of central banks taking unorthodox steps to stimulate their economies isn\u2019t over: \u201cWith the two year anniversary of Abenomics approaching, and growth and inflation faltering, the strong and decisive action from the Bank of Japan shows that it is not just the ECB that will \u2018do whatever it takes\u2019. For central banks, with monetary policy at the zero bound, there is no Plan B. Depending on the evolution of economic growth and inflation from here, the risk remains that we see more (rather than less) easing.\u201d Heads-up.... we get the overall eurozone unemployment, and inflation data, in just under 10 minutes. Economists had hoped that euro area CPI would rise to 0.4%, from 0.3% last month -- but that was before surprisingly weak German price data yesterday. Then, at 10.30am, the Russian central bank announces its latest monetary policy decision -- and it could well raise interest rates to support the ruble... And here\u2019s a handy chart from fastFT, showing that Italy\u2019s unemployment rate is back at its eurozone-crisis highs: The economic malaise in Italy has deepened, with the unemployment rate jumping unexpectedly last month. Data just released by the country\u2019s statistics body, ISTAT, showed that the jobless rate rose to 12.6% in September. This matches levels last seen in the 1970s, according to Reuters data. ISTAT reported that: In September 2014 22.457 million persons were employed, +0.4% compared with August 2014. Unemployed were 3.236 million, +1.5% with respect to the previous month. August\u2019s unemployment rate has also been revised higher, to 12.5% from 12.3% originally. There\u2019s slightly better news on youth unemployment -- the jobless rate for 15-24 year olds has dropped by 0.8 percentage points, but is still far too high at 42.9%. This bodes badly for Italy\u2019s hopes of avoiding a new recession. Reminder: we get the overall eurozone unemployment rate in around 40 minutes.... Shares in SuperGroup have slumped by 10% this morning, after it issued a profit warning and blamed warm autumn weather (more details here). The picture is no better in Germany either -- retail sales there slumped by 3.2% in September, compared with August. That\u2019s the biggest fall since May 2007. More details here. Gloomy news from France this morning -- consumer spending fell by 0.8% month-on-month in September, with households reining in their spending on clothing. Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda has warned that Japan\u2019s battle against deflation has reached a \u2018critical moment\u2019. He was speaking at a press conference in Toyko, explaining why BoJ policymakers voted to boost their stimulus programme. I\u2019ve taken some key quotes off Reuters: Kuroda said: \u201cNow is a critical moment for Japan to emerge from deflation. That\u2019s why we expanded QQE.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s step shows our unwavering determination to end deflation.\u201d \u201cOpinion emerged from the board that we should expand QQE in the process of discussing our semiannual report ... The board was split with some doubting whether it was appropriate to take (additional easing) steps now.\u201d \u201cThis is a pretty drastic step, so I think there will be a significant effect (on the economy). We don\u2019t think there is an immediate need to do anything further ... but we will make necessary policy adjustments looking at upside, downside risks.\u201d \u201cFor now, I think we\u2019ve done enough to respond to risks.\u201d Kuroda also channelled Mario Draghi, his counterpart at the ECB, when discussing inflation expectations, saying the BoJ would do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to get the public\u2019s inflation expectations up. \u201cJapan is different from countries like the United States, which has inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent. Actual price moves have a big impact on inflation expectations. If actual price rises slow, it hurts momentum. There was a risk that despite having made steady progress, we could face a delay in eradicating the public\u2019s deflation mindset.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important for the BOJ to strongly commit to achieving its price target to get its price target firmly embedded in people\u2019s mindset. \u201cWe\u2019ve pledged to do whatever it takes to achieve our 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t do much good in trying to shake off the public\u2019s deflation mindset if you just say inflation will reach 2 percent some day. We expanded QQE to pre-empt risks.\u201d Marc Ostwald, economist at ADM Investor Services, reckons the decision to beef up the BoJ\u2019s monetary expansion to 80 trillion yen per year, up from \u00a560-70bn before, is a \u2018desperate\u2019 move. Financial markets will \u201ccertainly welcome the BoJ ostensibly stepping into the QE void left by the Fed\u201d, he adds. Details of this morning\u2019s rally in Europe: The London stock market has opened, and shares are surging as investors welcome the news that Japan\u2019s central bank has boosted its stimulus plan. The FTSE 100 jumped 85 points at the open, with almost every share gaining ground. That\u2019s a 1.2% gain, to 6549 points. Other European markets are rallying -- the German DAX, French CAC and Italian MIB all jumped at least 1.8%. The Bank of Japan has also halved its growth forecasts for this financial year. It now expects growth of just 0.5% in the year to March, down from 1.0% three months ago. The BoJ got the timing of today\u2019s surprise stimulus boost just right, reckons Eric Burroughs of Reuters, as the markets were adjusting to the end of America\u2019s QE programme. Another morning, another profit warning from a UK retailer. This time it is SuperGroup, which has warned investors that the unseasonably warm autumn has hit its sales. It says: As widely reported by other retailers in the apparel sector, after a strong start to the quarter, September and October have both seen an exceptional period of warm weather across the UK and the rest of Europe which is expected to continue into November. It admitted that like-for- like sales fell by 4.2% in the last quarter, \u201calthough performance has been much more difficult in later weeks\u201d. Supergroup now expects profits of \u00a360m to \u00a365m this year, down from around \u00a369m to \u00a373m. In other news... Royal Bank of Scotland has just become the latest bank to make provisions for a fine over the foreign exchange-fixing scandal. RBS is setting aside \u00a3400m to cover the cost of the on-going investigation into the \u00a33.5tn a day FX market. Investigators believe some currency traders have conspired to rig the daily \u2018fix\u2019 -- the official rate at which currencies trade against each other. RSB is also putting aside another \u00a3100m to cover compensation payments to customers missold payment protection insurance (PPI). RBS is holding a press conference now: More reaction to the BoJ\u2019s move: Financial experts are scrambling to react to the surprise news that Japan will launch a more aggressive stimulus programme. Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities Japan, says (via Reuters): \u201cIt was a total surprise that the BOJ eased further at this time given that BOJ executives have not voiced such pessimistic views lately. The move was apparently made in response to underlying weakness in prices.\u201d Takeshi Minami, Tokyo-based chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, reckons the BOJ\u2019s move should allow prime minister Abe to push on with his unpopular sales tax hike: Governor Kuroda couldn\u2019t be bullish anymore -- inflation has slowed to 1 percent and oil prices are going to weigh on prices,\u201d \u201cKuroda also thought about Abe\u2019s decision on the sales tax. He really didn\u2019t want Abe to postpone it.\u201d Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says the move smacks of panic: Peter Thal Larsen of Reuters is also struck by the timing, given the Federal Reserve has just stopped its own bond-buying programme: Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons European investors will cheer the move: Asia stocks surged overnight and the resultant rally is likely to filter through to European markets this morning as investors cheer a further bout of monetary largesse, as the stimulus jamboree continues. And here are CMC\u2019s early calls: FTSE100 is expected to open 77 points higher at 6,540 DAX is expected to open 131 points higher at 9,245 CAC40 is expected to open 55 points higher at 4,196 There was euphoria on trading floors across Tokyo after the Bank of Japan announced it will extend its stimulus programme: The Nikkei surged by 4.8%, its biggest daily rise in over a year, to close at 16,413 points; a level last seen in November 2007. The new Japanese stimulus plan has send the yen tumbling to a seven-year low. It slumped to as low as 111.22 yen to the US dollar, the weakest level since 2007. That\u2019s likely to cheer the Bank of Japan, as a weaker yen should push inflation up. Good morning. Big news from Tokyo - the Bank of Japan has bowed to pressure and extended its stimulus programme in a renewed bid to stave off deflation, stunning the markets. BoJ policymakers agreed (narrowly) to buy more assets with newly created money. They will now aim to widen Japan\u2019s monetary based by 80 trillion yen per year, up from the \u00a560t-70 trillion level previously targeted. They will also buy more riskier assets, including funds traded on the stock markets. The BoJ acted after inflation data, released overnight, showed Japan\u2019s consumer prices index had fallen for the second year running. Concern was growing that Japan\u2019s bold bid to stimulate inflation and revive the economy was faltering, nearly two years after prime minister Shinzo Abe and BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda had launched radical action. In a statement, the BoJ said: Japan\u2019s economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend and is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential. However, on the price front, somewhat weak developments in demand following the consumption tax hike and a substantial decline in crude oil prices have been exerting downward pressure recently. If the current downward pressure on prices remains, there is a risk that conversion of deflationary mindset, which has so far been progressing steadily, will be delayed. Today\u2019s action is a real surprise, sending shares soaring on the Japanese stock market and weakening the yen. And the BoJ was split over the decision - voting 5-4 in favour: But will it work, or are Japan\u2019s economic problems too deep-rooted for monetary policy, however innovative and bold, to fix? I\u2019ll be tracking the best reaction and analysis, along with other news from the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business through the day....

The Debt Management Office estimates that the nation has paid \u00a31.26bn in interest on these bonds since 1927.</p> <p>The national war bonds, which paid out a rate of interest of 5% initially (cut to 3.5% in 1932), were issued in 1917 as the government sought to raise more money to finance the ongoing cost of the first world war, which started with the issue of the first war loan in November 1914. The bonds were sold to private investors in 1917 with the advertisement: \u201cIf you cannot fight, you can help your country by investing all you can in 5 per cent Exchequer Bonds ... Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>These consols also include some debts dating back to the Crimea War, and losses incurred during the South Sea Bubble.</p> <h2>More here: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/31/uk-first-world-war-bonds-redeemed\">UK bonds that financed first world war to be redeemed 100 years later</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8152799e392ab5884ecfa64d3e920620469962e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/31/1414755929596/0a358c0f-358b-4276-a9c5-0f2f634a58b8-275x420.jpeg\" alt=\"UK war bonds poster\" width=\"275\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK war bonds poster</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Government</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://t.co/OqM0nODWSv\">ITV News\u2019s Joel Hills has blogged about the plan</a> - here\u2019s a flavour:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In value terms the bulk of Britain\u2019s First World War bonds are held by big City institutions, but over 100,000 War Bonds are worth less than \u00a31,000 and are held by ordinary members of the public.</p> <p>In many cases these bonds will have been passed down through the generations.</p> <p>Their value has been slowly eroded by inflation (\u00a3100 in 1914 is worth around \u00a33,000 now) and the returns today are almost derisory (a War Bond of \u00a3100 pays out \u00a33.50 in annual interest).

      "bodyText": "October might have been a bit of a horror show for the markets but Halloween saw a spirited revival of fortunes. Fears of global slowdown, the ending of central bank support and geopolitical tensions in the middle east, not to mention the spread of Ebola, sent shares tumbling to a fifteen month low a couple of weeks ago. Over the month the FTSE 100 fell 1.15%, its worst October performance since 2009. But to put things in perspective, this was an improvement on the 2.89% drop recorded in September, and the market even ended the month in positive mood. The index jumped 82.92 points on Friday to close at 6546.47. Earlier the Nikkei had hit a seven year high, while European markets and Wall Street - in early trading - were also in buoyant mood. Indeed, the US market hit new intra-day highs. The immediate catalyst was the unexpected news that the Bank of Japan planned to increase its quantitative easing programme by pumping \u00a580tn (\u00a3447bn) a year into the economy, mainly through the purchase of government bonds, in a bid to ward off the threat of deflation. With the US Federal Reserve ending its monthly bond buying programme on Wednesday, investors welcomed another central bank stepping in to fill the gap. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said: Fears about a slowing global economy and other tedious fundamentals that seemed so pressing fewer than three weeks ago have been cast aside in another unseemly rush to buy shares.

British Airways owner International Airlines Group climbed 18.5p to 409.2p after an upbeat trading statement but Direct Line dropped 5.5p to 276p after it said premiums for the first nine months of the year fell 5% compared to the same time in 2013.

      "bodyText": "Bank shares jumped on Friday after the Bank of England outlined a new regime to assess the financial strength of the UK\u2019s biggest financial institutions that was less draconian than feared. The chancellor, George Osborne, said he wanted an assessment of the impact of the new rules on lending before the Bank of England would be allowed to toughen them any further \u2013 amid fears mortgage rates could start to rise if policymakers became too stringent in forcing the banks to hold more capital. Barclays led bank shares higher, closing up 8%, while the bailed-out banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group rose 6% and almost 3% respectively. The Building Societies\u2019 Association said policymakers had heeded warnings about the impact on the price of mortgages if a tougher stance was taken. The Bank of England said it was requiring the biggest banks to hold 3p of capital for every \u00a31 they lend out by imposing a 3% leverage ratio across the industry \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d \u2013 though many are already operating at this level of safety. But Threadneedle Street\u2019s financial policy committee (FPC) wants to be able to add additional layers of safety.

On top of this the Bank wants another component to the leverage ratio, allowing it to push the maximum to 4.95% in extreme circumstances if it thought the markets were becoming over exuberant. At the outside that would mean Britain\u2019s banks would need to raise \u00a39.6bn of extra capital by 2019 \u2013 a much smaller figure than feared. Osborne, who had asked the FPC to conduct the review, said he accepted the logic for an extra component to be added to the 3% level. But he said more work needed to be done on understanding the impact and said the FPC\u2019s new consultation on imposing an extra buffer on the domestic banks should look at the impact on lending and competition in banking. The Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, described the new framework as prudent. Setting the leverage ratio has proved controversial since the 2009 banking crisis. In 2011 the independent commission on banking, chaired by Sir John Vickers, had recommended having a leverage ratio of 4%. The leverage ratio \u2013 a way of measuring the financial strength of banks \u2013 takes into account the value of lending and does not allow banks to make assessments about its riskiness, unlike capital ratios, which also measure bank\u2019s financial strength but were discredited during the financial crisis as it was found banks had underestimated the risks they were running. The Bank of England defied expectations that it would set a single leverage ratio but it said the level would need to rise above 3% for some lenders because while this ratio would have been enough to absorb the losses incurred during the crisis, banks would not have enough to continue operating. Banks have already been taking steps to boost ratios in anticipation of the regime. Barclays would need a 3.7% ratio by 2019. It currently has 3.5% and said it was \u201cwell on track to reach our target of a ratio in excess of 4% in 2016\u201d.

The central bank played down the impact on the cost of borrowing for consumers \u2013 at least those taking out small loan to value mortgages; in other words, those with large deposits \u2013 saying it would be quite small. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe new regulations will therefore require some banks to continue to raise more capital over the next couple of years.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK government is to repay part of the nation\u2019s first world war debt \u2013 100 years since the start of the war. As Europe marks the centenary of the Great War, the Treasury said it would pay off \u00a3218m from a 4% consolidated loan next February, as part of a redemption of bonds stretching as far back as the 18th century. They also relate to the South Sea Bubble crisis of 1720, the Napoleonic and Crimean wars and the Irish potato famine. Almost \u00a32bn of first world war debt remains, and the government said it was looking into the practicalities of repaying it in full. The \u201c4% consols\u201d were issued in 1927 by Winston Churchill, then chancellor, to refinance national war bonds originating from the first world war. The government\u2019s Debt Management Office (DMO) estimates that the nation has paid \u00a31.26bn in interest on these bonds since 1927. Barclays bond strategist Moyeen Islam said: \u201cFor those of us who love the gilt market, it\u2019s a sad day \u2013 there\u2019s a few old-timers crying in the corner. But it\u2019s symbolic more than anything.\u201d The national war bonds, which paid out a rate of interest of 5%, were issued in 1917 as the government sought to raise more money to finance the ongoing cost of the first world war, which started with the issue of the first war loan in November 1914. The bonds were sold to private investors in 1917 with the advertisement: \u201cIf you cannot fight, you can help your country by investing all you can in 5 per cent Exchequer Bonds ... Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk.\u201d The Spectator wrote at the time: \u201cIt is the people of Great Britain who must provide the cash with which to finance the war, and there is little reason to doubt that they can do it if only they will. A large part of the nation, instead of being impoverished by the war, has been enriched.\u201d In addition to the war bonds, some of the debt being repaid dates as far back as the eighteenth century. In 1853, William Gladstone, then chancellor, consolidated the capital stock of the South Sea Company which had collapsed in the infamous South Sea Bubble financial crisis of 1720. And in 1888, then chancellor, George Goschen, converted bonds first issued in 1752 which were later used to finance the Napoleonic and Crimean wars, the Slavery Abolition Act (1835) and the Irish Distress Loan (1847). This debt will be repaid through the redemption of the 4% consols. Most of the bonds are owned by small investors. Of the 11,200 registered holders, 7,700 investors hold less than \u00a31000 nominal, and 92% of holders own less than \u00a310,000 each. This is the first time in more than 60 years that a chancellor has redeemed an undated gilt of this sort. The 4% consol is one of eight undated government bonds outstanding. The bonds are known as perpetuals because they have no redemption date. George Osborne, the chancellor, said: \u201cThe fact that we will no longer have to pay the high rate of interest on these gilts means that, most important of all, today\u2019s decision represents great value for money for the taxpayer. We will go on working through our plan that is gripping the public finances and delivering a brighter economic future.\u201d On Twitter, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll redeem \u00a3218m of 4% consols, including debts incurred because of South Sea Bubble. Another financial crisis we\u2019re clearing up after ...\u201d Investors have been paying renewed attention to bonds issued to pay for the first world war, partly because of the 100th anniversary of the war but also because their coupon, or interest rate, is attractive compared with the depressed returns on ordinary gilts. Toby Nangle, a fund manager at Threadneedle Asset Management, has been lobbying the DMO to pay off the bigger perpetual first world war bond that is now under review. That bond, called War Loan, is worth \u00a31.94bn and pays 3.5% to investors. It is the most widely held gilt and has about 125,000 mainly retail investors. Threadneedle is the second-biggest holder of the bond in its mutual funds after Fidelity and has been building that position since June. Nangle said the government\u2019s decision to repay the consolidated loan was a \u201cgreat example of pragmatic and attentive debt management on the part of the UK government\u201d. He added: \u201cI hope that this move is the first of many to cut the interest bill and save taxpayers money.\u201d Nangle has calculated that the government could save more than \u00a3300m if it pays off the War Loan bonds at face value of \u00a3100 each, which it has the right to do with 90 days\u2019 notice. He argued the saving would be about the same as the amount the government will make from selling its stake in Eurotunnel, announced with the intention of reducing government debt this month. Ian Spreadbury, portfolio manager at Fidelity, said: \u201cThere is clearly an economic incentive for the Treasury to redeem the War Loan and refinance it through existing gilts at a lower yield.\u201d Its coupon of 3.5% is expensive, especially considering yields on long-dated gilts maturing in 2068 are about 2.95%. The War Loan currently trades below par at about \u00a392 with a yield of 3.8%. \u201cAhead of the election, one challenge is political as there is a long tail of individual holders of the War Loan that would be affected by any decision to redeem it. It may also be administratively complex and expensive,\u201d he said. For long periods, high inflation depressed the War Loan\u2019s market value meaning the government would have lost money by buying the bonds back. But, with the bond trading at a few pounds below its callable value, Nangle has argued it makes sense for the government to call it in. The government could then issue a new bond paying less than 3.5% saving money on interest payments while, he admits, allowing his clients to make money. \u201cIt would absolutely be in the short-term interests of my clients to have this called because it would be a higher price than the price in the market,\u201d Nangle told the Guardian last week. But he said his clients\u2019 profit would be a byproduct of a sensible deal for the government. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be rewarding the City or anything like that,\u201d he said.",

Its shares have climbed 17.4p or 4.5% to 408.1p after it reported a 30% rise in third quarter profits to a better than expected \u20ac900m and raised its forecast for the year. </p> <p>Part of the rise was due to cost controls and the introduction of more fuel-efficient aircraft. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>IAG management has today increased pressure on its European rivals, upping its full year profit forecast. Cost reduction at the company remains central.

      "bodyText": "Well, October will not be as bad as September as far as the market is concerned, and Halloween in particular is nothing like a horror show. With an unexpected stimulus package announced by the Bank of Japan - turning the money taps on faster even as the US Federal Reserve pulls the plug on its bond buying programme - the FTSE 100 is ending the week and the month on a positive note. British Airways and Iberia owner International Airlines Group - which shrugged off poor figures from German airline Lufthansa on Thursday - is leading the way. Its shares have climbed 17.4p or 4.5% to 408.1p after it reported a 30% rise in third quarter profits to a better than expected \u20ac900m and raised its forecast for the year. Part of the rise was due to cost controls and the introduction of more fuel-efficient aircraft. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers said: IAG management has today increased pressure on its European rivals, upping its full year profit forecast. Cost reduction at the company remains central. More fuel efficient aircraft are playing their part, with restructuring initiatives and resulting increased staff productivity at Iberia again contributing. Expanded capacity at British Airways and its exposure to the stronger US economy is assisting, while new bases in Italy and Belgium for its low cost airline Vueling are appealing to cash pressured consumers. On the downside, the spread of Ebola remains a concern for the travel industry as a whole, while the group\u2019s cyclical nature continues to leave it dependent on improving economic growth. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently up 75.14 points at 6538.69, helped by the Japanese news which pushed the Nikkei to a seven year high. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK said: As one door closes, another one opens as the saying goes and while we may have seen the end of the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond buying programme for the time being and the ECB reluctant to step into the breach, it appears that the Bank of Japan has no such qualms, filling the void left by the US central bank as overnight they surprised the markets with the announcement of a fresh bout of monetary stimulus. Concerns about slowing inflation and a sluggish economy appear to have persuaded a narrow majority of Bank of Japan members to vote to increase the annual stimulus to 80 trillion yen from 60-70 trn yen in an open ended manner. The index is currently down 1.25% on the month and, volatile as it has been, the decline is much less than the 2.89% fall seen in September. Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 14.6p to 379.9p following its figures. But Randgold Resources is down 83p to \u00a336.96 and Fresnillo has fallen 14p to 702.5p as gold and silver edged lower after recent rises. Randgold was also unsettled by unrest in Burkina Faso where it has operations. Direct Line is down 1.7p at 279.8p despite saying it was on track to meet its 2014 profit targets. Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital issued a sell note, saying: Direct Line has issued a mixed third quarter statement.

The company behind the Superdry fashion brand - beloved of the likes of Kate Winslet and David Beckham - has seen its shares slump around 9% after a profit warning. In an unscheduled statement it said profits would be below expectations because warm autumn weather had hit demand for winter clothes. This follows a similar warning from Next earlier this week. And it contrasts with early September when SuperGroup said autumn sales had got off to a flying start. Now it admits: After a strong start to the quarter, September and October have both seen an exceptional period of warm weather across the UK and the rest of Europe which is expected to continue into November. This has resulted in a high degree of uncertainty around the future performance of the autumn/winter ranger, particularly outerwear which is a significant part of the Superdry product mix. So with high level of discounting and investments in infrastructure, the company was more cautious on the second half which generates up to 80% of its profits.

      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell has recruited the former chief executive of DuPont and former chairman of Bank of America Charles Holliday as its chairman, to take over from Jorma Ollila, who will step down at the annual meeting in May after nine years in the role. Holliday, 66, an engineer by education, will be the first American to chair the group, Europe\u2019s biggest oil company by market value. He spent most of his career at DuPont, having joined the US chemical company in 1970 and becoming chief executive 18 years later. Under his leadership DuPont established a goal of decreasing its environmental footprint and turned itself from a chemical producer into a science-based products and services company. Holliday also headed the 10-member executive committee of the United Nations\u2019 and World Bank\u2019s sustainable energy for all initiative, launched in 2009. The announcement came as Shell\u2019s profit rose strongly in the third quarter year on year, but the company warned it had yet to feel the full effect of the falling oil price. Shell\u2019s core profit, excluding one-time items, for the three months to the end of September increased 31% to $5.8bn (\u00a33.6bn) from a year earlier and beat market expectations. The increase was down to new, more profitable production and lower exploration costs at the exploration and production business, along with a doubling of profit at the smaller refining and processing arm. However, compared with the second quarter of this year, profits were down 5% as the declining price of oil, which fell more quickly this month, started to take effect. Shell\u2019s finance director, Simon Henry, said the quarterly results only reflected about a third of the big fall in oil prices, which averaged $103 a barrel during the period, and weakening demand was at least as big a factor as the abundant production from the US shale boom. \u201cEqually important, if not maybe more important, is demand. Demand is weaker, particularly in emerging markets. In OECD markets, demand is flat or declining so all the growth is driven by emerging markets. That is having quite a significant impact in addition to new sources of supply.\u201d Oil companies have had billions of pounds wiped off their stock market valuations as oil prices dropped by almost a quarter over the past four months. The price of crude has slumped to a four-year low of about $85 a barrel as supplies have outstripped slowing global demand, particularly in China. Goldman Sachs slashed its forecast for Brent crude prices to an average of $85 a barrel for the first quarter of next year, down from its earlier estimate of $100 a barrel. Henry said Shell would consider cuts to investment in projects where spending was flexible if the oil price stays low next year. It may also consider selling assets in the North Sea if it believes other companies would place a higher value on them. \u201cIt\u2019s quite likely we will be taking a very close at our levels of investment if we see the oil price weakness continuing,\u201d he said. BP said on Tuesday that it would spend up to $2bn less than planned on capital projects this year after third-quarter profits fell 19%. Shell\u2019s rival was hit by falling profits from its investment in Rosneft, the Russian state oil company. Oil companies are selling surplus assets and cutting costs and investment spending to support profits as the outlook for the oil price weakens. Shell plans to shed $15bn of assets by the end of 2015 and sold $3.6bn in the third quarter, taking the running total to $11.6bn. Henry said Shell planned its investments on the basis of oil prices between $70 and $110 a barrel and that short-term changes to the price would have little effect on its big projects. The company increased the third-quarter dividend by 4% to 47 cents a share from a year earlier.
