      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s plan to charge a new levy on businesses to help reach ambitious apprenticeship targets is facing resistance from big employer groups who warn ministers not to sacrifice quality of training. Chancellor George Osborne announced the levy in his summer budget as a key part of his bid to show he was on the side of working people. The government has pitched it to business as a way to end years of under-investment in training and solve skills shortages with 3m new apprenticeships by 2020. But as an initial consultation on the levy closes on Friday, two leading business groups have expressed scepticism. One main concern is that employers could rebadge existing jobs as apprenticeships to meet training targets and recoup the costs of the levy. Manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF describes the levy, scheduled to be introduced in 2017, as \u201clittle more than a tax on business\u201d. In its response to the consultation, it is sceptical about the government achieving its 3m target, a goal that would require 600,000 new apprenticeship starts every year. \u201cCompanies have serious concerns as to how the scheme will work in practice,\u201d said Tim Thomas, EEF head of employment &amp; skills policy. \u201cIf this proposal is to avoid being a pile-them-high, sell-them-cheap approach and actually increase the quality of apprenticeships as well as hitting the government\u2019s 3m target, then the government must sit down with employers as a matter of urgency to design a workable scheme,\u201d added Thomas. The government says it will provide more detail on the levy rate and scope later in the year but has insisted those employers who are \u201ccommitted to apprenticeship training\u201d will be able to get back more than they put in. The CBI employers group, which represents about 190,000 businesses, wants assurances that the scheme will not prove costly to companies. Its submission recommends all funds raised by the new levy must be ringfenced for training and that the levy rate be set by a new politically independent levy board. \u201cBusiness is committed to working with the government to tackle head-on the skills shortages many of our high-growth sectors face, and we have been vocal in our support of employer contributions in the past,\u201d said Katja Hall, CBI deputy director-general. \u201cBut at a time when firms are already investing over \u00a340bn a year on formal training and increasing apprenticeships, there is a high risk it could undermine the system not strengthen it. \u201cA new levy won\u2019t be welcomed by business, so we want to see a new politically independent levy board setting the rate based on clear evidence with the funds ringfenced.\u201d Employers have also raised concerns that the levy could divert funds away from other forms of training just as the government seeks to improve the UK\u2019s woeful record on productivity \u2013 a measure of the output per hour worked that has long lagged the performance in other advanced economies. A survey of big employers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), the trade association for the human resources sector, showed that almost a third (31%) believed the levy would cause them to reduce their investment in other areas of workforce training and development. A further 22% said the levy could encourage employers to accredit training they would be running anyway as apprenticeship schemes, while just 20% believed the levy would drive up quality of apprenticeship schemes. The poll of 275 employers, conducted to inform CIPD\u2019s response to the consultation, found employers were divided over the levy plans, with 39% in favour in principle, 31% opposed and a further 30% undecided. \u201cOur survey suggests that boosting both numbers and quality at the same time will be a significant challenge,\u201d said CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tough export markets and weaker consumer spending continued to take their toll on UK factories last month, prompting the first job losses for the sector in more than two years, according to a survey that echoed signs of manufacturing weakness around the world. The performance at UK factories was lacklustre in September, when growth slipped to a three-month low. Against the backdrop of warnings about the uncertain outlook for global growth, eurozone manufacturing also lost momentum and output from Chinese factories continued to fall. For the UK, the first snapshot of manufacturing performance in September continued a downbeat trend. The key measure of factory activity slipped back to within a whisker of June\u2019s two-month low, according to the Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI report. At 51.5 the main balance was still above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction, but it marked a slowdown from 51.6 in August and economists said it would further convince policymakers at the Bank of England to hold off from raising interest rates from their current record low of 0.5%. The survey reported manufacturing job losses for the first time since April 2013. \u201cJob cuts send a signal that manufacturers are becoming more cautious about the future, which may lead to a further scaling back of production at some firms in coming months,\u201d said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit. \u201cThe ongoing malaise of the manufacturing sector will add to broader growth worries and supports dovish calls for a first rise in interest rates to be held off until the industry returns to a firmer footing.\u201d The manufacturing sector has been growing for 30 months, according to the survey, but the pace has slowed since the start of the summer. While output growth improved slightly last month, growth in new orders tailed off to the weakest rate seen this year. Manufacturing growth across the eurozone slowed to a five-month low, according to separate reports from Markit. Its factory PMI for the currency bloc slipped to 52.0 from 52.3 in August. Activity slowed in Germany and Spain, while the French factory sector is expanding again. The slump at China\u2019s factories also continued, but there were some signs of stabilisation. The Caixin China general manufacturing PMI found that production was still falling, forcing firms to lay off more people. The official manufacturing PMI published by the Beijing government also showed that manufacturing was still contracting, but at a slower rate. Economists drew links between China\u2019s downturn and the pressures on UK manufacturers already grappling with a relatively strong pound, which makes their goods more expensive to overseas buyers. \u201cManufacturing continues to face headwinds from weaker demand from China and emerging markets \u2013 where the UK sends up to 15% of its exports \u2013 in addition to strength in sterling which is up 15% in effective terms compared to its February 2013 low,\u201d said Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg bank. He saw little prospect of manufacturing having boosted the wider economy in recent months but was optimistic EU and US demand would help the sector. \u201cFor now, UK manufacturers might see export demand dwindling as the developing world struggles with slowing Chinese demand and weak commodity prices, but in the medium term rising demand from the UK\u2019s biggest and closest trading partners should help underpin a recovery in UK manufacturing,\u201d Pickering added. Separate UK figures on productivity also pointed to recent weakness in the manufacturing sector. There was a 0.5% fall in factory output per hour in the second quarter, bucking the improving trend for the wider economy, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Across all sectors, productivity grew by 0.9% from the first to the second quarter on an output per hour measure. That took productivity to the highest level on record, but it was still 15% below where it would have been had pre-downturn trends continued, the ONS said. Zach Witton, a deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cToday\u2019s data suggests the challenging export environment and weak demand for investment goods in the oil and gas sector has started to take a toll on business confidence.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Global investors will suck capital out of emerging economies this year for the first time since 1988, as they brace themselves for a Chinese crash, according to the Institute of International Finance. Capital flooded into promising emerging economies in the years that followed the global financial crisis of 2008-09, as investors bet that rapid expansion in countries such as Turkey and Brazil could help to offset stodgy growth in the debt-burdened US, Europe and Japan. But with domestic investors in these and other emerging markets squirrelling their money overseas, at the same time as international investors calculate the costs of a sharp downturn in Chinese growth, the IIF, which represents the world\u2019s financial industry, said: \u201cWe now expect that net capital flows to emerging markets in 2015 will be negative for the first time since 1988.\u201d Unlike in 2008-09, when capital flows to emerging markets plunged abruptly as a result of the US sub-prime mortgage crisis, the IIF\u2019s analysts say the current reversal is the latest wave of a homegrown downturn. \u201cThis year\u2019s slowdown represents a marked intensification of trends that have been underway since 2012, making the current episode feel more like a lengthening drought rather than a crisis event,\u201d it says, in its latest monthly report on capital flows. The IIF expects \u201conly a moderate rebound\u201d in 2016, as expectations for growth in emerging economies remain weak. Mohamed El-Erian, economic advisor to Allianz, responding to the data, described emerging markets as \u201ccompletely unhinged\u201d, and warned that US growth may not be enough to rescue the global economy. \u201cIt\u2019s not that powerful to pull everybody out,\u201d he told CNBC. Capital flight from China, where the prospects for growth have deteriorated sharply in recent months, and the authorities\u2019 botched handling of the stock market crash in August undermined confidence in economic management, has been the main driver of the turnaround. \u201cThe slump in private capital inflows is most dramatic for China,\u201d the institute says. \u201cSlowing growth due to excess industrial capacity, correction in the property sector and export weakness, together with monetary easing and the stock market bust have discouraged inflows.\u201d At the same time, domestic Chinese firms have been cutting back on their borrowing overseas, fearing that they may find themselves exposed if the yuan continues to depreciate, making it harder to repay foreign currency loans. The IIF\u2019s analysis shows that portfolio flows \u2013 sales of emerging market stocks and bonds \u2013 have been more important than the reversal of foreign direct investment (for example, multinationals closing down plants or business projects) in the recent shift. It warns that several countries are likely to find their economies particularly vulnerable to this capital drought. \u201cCountries most in jeopardy from emerging-market turbulence include those with large current account deficits, questionable macro-policy frameworks, large corporate foreign exchange liabilities, and acute political uncertainties. Brazil and Turkey combine these features.\u201d This warning echoed a one from the International Monetary Fund last week, that rising US interest rates could unleash a new financial crisis, as firms in emerging economies find themselves unable to service their debts.",

If England are eliminated from the Rugby World Cup by Australia on Saturday, about \u00a33bn is likely to be knocked off the stock market when trading resumes on Monday, according to an academic at London Business School. Alex Edmans, professor of finance at the school, said his research showed that if a national team is eliminated from an international tournament it makes investors fed up and pessimistic the next day. After Wales beat Fiji, England have to win against Australia on Saturday to stay in the competition. A defeat for a national rugby team triggers a fall of 0.15% the next day \u2013 about \u00a33bn when applied to the UK stock market, he found.

Edmans tested the impact of international football results on stock returns in 39 countries and found that markets typically fall about 0.5% the day after a national team is knocked out of a big competition. The effect was less for rugby but still statistically significant, Edmans said. There would be no rise in the stock market as a result of an England win, he added. This is partly because supporters are wildly over-optimistic about their team\u2019s chances, so a loss is a bitter blow whereas a win is expected. Edmans\u2019 research, conducted with academics from the University of North Carolina and the Norwegian School of Management, found that markets fell more after a national defeat depending on the importance of the tournament and the stage at which the game took place.

UAW members rejected a tentative agreement between with Fiat Chrysler by 65% after a ballot on Tuesday, the results of which were finalised on Thursday. UAW members at large assembly plants in Toledo, Ohio, and Sterling Heights, Michigan, all rejected the pact as did most other factories, by a wide margin. \u201cWe will gather the issues together; notify FCA [Fiat Chrysler] that further discussions are needed. We don\u2019t consider this a setback; we consider the membership vote a part of the process we respect,\u201d Dennis Williams, president of the UAW, said in a statement. \u201cWhat I love about our organization most of all is that no matter what we do, what action we take, the ultimate decision and the power of the union is our members and they make the final decision,\u201d he said. Ahead of the vote, workers had expressed concerns about the continuance of a two-tier pay structure, healthcare benefits and the possibility that some car production would be shifted to Mexico. About 40,000 union Fiat Chrysler employees \u2013 and about 100,000 Ford and GM employees \u2013 have been working under a contract extension since 14 September. The UAW began bargaining with Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler in July. Fiat Chrysler was selected as the lead company in the talks, making it the focus of bargaining. The new deal had pay raises but didn\u2019t end a lower wage rate for those hired after 2007. These \u201cnew\u201d hires start at about half the $29 an hour wage that the long-serving workers are paid. The union originally agreed to a two-tier pay structure back in 2007 when then-Chrysler was near bankruptcy. When a tentative agreement was announced in September, Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne agreed that tiered wages were unfair and said the negotiators came up with a carefully crafted agreement \u201cwhereby that issue will go away\u201d. In a statement released on Thursday, the company expressed its disappointment with the vote. \u201cThe tentative agreement was designed to yield a strong and competitive Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US, thus providing stability for our workforce and opportunity for future growth and investment in an increasingly complex global marketplace,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe company will make decisions, as always, based on achieving our industrial objectives, and looks forward to continuing a dialogue with the UAW.\u201d \u201cThis is our time now. The UAW has given back and given back, making concessions after concessions. I think Sergio may have a hard lesson to learn here but we are ready for that,\u201d Phil Reiter told the Wall Street Journal. For the past two years, Reiter, 44, has been working for Fiat Chrysler in Toledo. The union will now gather issues and notify the Fiat Chrysler that \u201cfurther discussions are needed\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t consider this a setback; we consider the membership vote a part of the process we respect,\u201d said Williams.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Karin Forseke and Katherine Garrett-Cox have a remarkable talent for compromise. Back in the spring, the chair and (for a little while yet) chief executive of Alliance Trust, spent \u00a33m of shareholders\u2019 funds fighting proposals from Elliott Advisors, a New York hedge fund that thought the grand old Dundee-based investment trust required a shake-up. The sport was excellent. Forseke denounced the rebels as \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d and the Elliott camp made hay with Garrett-Cox\u2019s \u00a31.4m pay packet, an outsized reward for middling investment performance, it argued. Sadly, Forseke and Garrett-Cox, realising their support among rank-and-file investors was not what they hoped or expected, spoiled the fun before the vote. They negotiated a truce that saw two of Elliott\u2019s three nominees, previously denounced as short-termist yes men, ushered into the boardroom. That was the first compromise and inevitably it has led to a second. As before, Elliott has got about two-thirds of what it wanted. Costs will be cut; the trust will be separated from its fund management division; that fund manager can be fired at six months\u2019 notice; share buy-backs will be used to narrow the discount to asset value; non-core assets will be sold; and the board will comprise only non-executive directors. That last change means Garrett-Cox will soon have to adapt to a humbler role as mere boss of Alliance Trust Investments (ATI), the fund manager. One can admire her appetite to stay and prove her stock-picking skills \u2013 but, given the past fuss, she\u2019d gain more kudos if she told us she was a taking a pay cut to do the smaller job. The reforms could work; the proof, of course, will be the trust\u2019s performance. But the process of getting to this point has been tortuous. The Elliott nominees, shamefully, never spoke during the battle in the spring. Forseke, by contrast, has performed verbal gymnastics. She spent those millions trying to defend the old system but now says change leaves the trust \u201csignificantly better positioned\u201d. Her next compromise will surely have to be her own departure. Fast cars, slow response Hot news out of Wolfsburg. The top brass at Volkswagen didn\u2019t spent Wednesday evening watching their football team lose at Old Trafford. No, they were engaged in important business: \u201c[Wednesday] evening, the members of executive committee discussed the membership of the committee which had already been discussed last week.\u201d That sentence needs to be deciphered for those who aren\u2019t following every twist of Volkswagen\u2019s response to its emissions crisis. The five-strong executive committee of the supervisory committee, a sub-set of the full 20-strong supervisory committee, is establishing yet another committee to investigate the scandal. That\u2019s an awful lot of committees, and an awful lot of discussion about committees. No wonder Thursday\u2019s statement also carried the news that \u201ccompletion of investigations will take at least several months\u201d. In the meantime, someone at Volkswagen \u2013 probably not sitting in a committee meeting \u2013 realised that there were still cars on sale which may have the dodgy software. About 4,000 vehicles with EA 189 engines have been pulled from sale in the UK as \u201ca voluntary measure\u201d. This is less than reassuring. It is now two weeks since the company learned that it had been caught cheating by US regulators, and it probably knew the game was up several months before that. The corporate confessions came promptly after public disgrace but energy was wasted in the few days attempting the impossible task of keeping chief executive Martin Winterkorn in his job. It should have been an obvious first step to establish which new cars might still have the defeat devices and then yank them from forecourts. Volkswagen is not helping itself in its response to the crisis. A Shire thing As we await the $100bn (\u00a366bn) bid for SAB Miller, let\u2019s not overlook the other big takeover battle involving a FTSE 100 company. On second thoughts, Shire\u2019s $30bn attempt to buy Baxalta of the US, to create \u201cthe leading biotech company focused on rare diseases,\u201d may be best forgotten. This one has been running since early August and Shire appears no nearer to bagging its prey. The message in Baxalta\u2019s share price is not encouraging \u2013 it\u2019s back to where it stood before Shire proposed an all-share combination and decided to appeal directly to its target\u2019s investors. Flemming Ornskov, Shire\u2019s chief executive, can keep pushing if he wishes but US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, by vowing to reduce the prices of specialist medicines, seems to have deflated this bid, as well as Shire\u2019s share price. Baxalta\u2019s stock has suffered, too, so perhaps there is still hope in an all-share bid structure. But, after nine fruitless weeks, Ornskov\u2019s best policy may be an orderly retreat. At least Anheuser-Busch\u2019s takeover attempt of SABMiller will be conducted under British rules, which require a bidder to put up or shut up within a month. It\u2019s a much better system. How much? Typical banker one-upmanship. Poor old Tony Hayward, chair of Glencore, cobbles together a few quid to buy 100,000 shares in the embattled mining-cum-trading house, then boardroom colleague John Mack, former Morgan Stanley hard-man, dips into into his back pocket to snap up 550,000. Just to rub it in, Hayward paid 90.9p a share but Mack got his at 80.8p.",

Back in the spring, the chair and (for a little while yet) chief executive of Alliance Trust, spent \u00a33m of shareholders\u2019 funds fighting proposals from Elliott Advisors, a New York hedge fund that thought the grand old Dundee-based investment trust required a shake-up.</p> <p>The sport was excellent. Forseke denounced the rebels as \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d and the Elliott camp made hay with Garrett-Cox\u2019s \u00a31.4m pay packet, an outsized reward for middling investment performance, it argued.</p> <p>Sadly, Forseke and Garrett-Cox, realising their support among rank-and-file investors was not what they hoped or expected, spoiled the fun before the vote. They negotiated a truce that saw two of Elliott\u2019s three nominees, previously denounced as short-termist yes men, ushered into the boardroom.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/01/katherine-garrett-cox-steps-down-alliance-trust-board\">Katherine Garrett-Cox to step down from Alliance Trust board</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That was the first compromise and inevitably it has led to a second. As before, Elliott has got about two-thirds of what it wanted. Costs will be cut; the trust will be separated from its fund management division; that fund manager can be fired at six months\u2019 notice; share buy-backs will be used to narrow the discount to asset value; non-core assets will be sold; and the board will comprise only non-executive directors.</p> <p>That last change means Garrett-Cox will soon have to adapt to a humbler role as mere boss of Alliance Trust Investments (ATI), the fund manager. One can admire her appetite to stay and prove her stock-picking skills \u2013 but, given the past fuss, she\u2019d gain more kudos if she told us she was a taking a pay cut to do the smaller job. </p> <p>The reforms could work; the proof, of course, will be the trust\u2019s performance. But the process of getting to this point has been tortuous. The Elliott nominees, shamefully, never spoke during the battle in the spring. </p> <p>Forseke, by contrast, has performed verbal gymnastics. She spent those millions trying to defend the old system but now says change leaves the trust \u201csignificantly better positioned\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Uber, the under-fire taxi-hailing app, has hit out at London\u2019s transport regulator, Transport for London (TfL), for taking it to the high court on Monday in the latest threat to its explosive growth in the London taxi market. The high court case, which will determine whether the Uber app breaks the law by effectively acting as a meter, is piling on the pressure for the ride-hailing firm. Uber, which is backed by investors including Wall Street institution Goldman Sachs, is already facing the threat of a major crackdown on its business practices in London following the announcement earlier this week of a public consultation. An Uber spokesman said on Thursday: \u201cThe proposals, and the court case, are designed to protect the black-cab industry rather than help them adapt to what people want.\u201d TfL, which provisionally took the view that Uber\u2019s app was lawful, subsequently referred that decision to the court. \u201cThe court will be dealing with what is a distinguishing part of the Uber offering,\u201d said Liam Griffin, chief executive of Europe\u2019s biggest minicab firm, Addison Lee. \u201cThis court case could potentially have a devastating effect on Uber\u2019s London business,\u201d he added. Uber is said to be confident it can survive a defeat in the high court. However, it is concerned that, if the case goes against them, it might need to make changes to the way its app operates that will make it less user friendly. The legal spat over whether the Uber app breaches the law comes towards the end of a tough week for the firm, which has 18,000 drivers (called registered partners) in the capital. In London, the group was shellshocked by TfL\u2019s decision to consider new proposals \u2013 including making passengers wait at least five minutes for a ride \u2013 after talks with the rest of the industry. The firm is facing problems in countries all over the world as it disrupts existing taxi services. In France, two of Uber\u2019s executives were in court to face criminal charges of illegally organising taxi services through the company\u2019s low-cost UberPop service. The trial has been delayed until mid-February so that both sides can review more data. In the Netherlands on Tuesday, the group\u2019s Amsterdam offices were raided as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into whether it is violating the country\u2019s laws over a super-cheap service using untrained drivers. On the same day, in Rio de Janeiro, Uber and other similar smartphone taxi apps were banned from operating. London\u2019s black-cab operators, who number more than 25,000, have long been arguing they want Uber to face tougher regulations so that the competition can be fairer. Uber, meanwhile, is arguing that regulation of the whole industry should be reduced, while adhering to tough safety standards. The black-cab drivers were given a boost yesterday when Hailo, an app firm, signed a new deal that boosts their tech offering in the battle against Uber. The black cabs have other app deals, with groups such as Gett and TaxiToo. Uber has launched a petition, which has so far attracted nearly 120,000 names, to support its fight against the new TfL proposals in London. It says: \u201cThese rules make no sense\u201d. \u201cWe understand that black-cab drivers are feeling the pressure from services like Uber,\u201d the petition states. \u201cBut the answer is to level the playing field by reducing today\u2019s burdensome black-cab regulations \u2013 not to introduce rules that will be bad for riders, drivers and London.\u201d TfL is chaired by Boris Johnson, who only two weeks ago branded black-taxi drivers as luddites. Yesterday, seven London Tory councillors, led by Peter Cuthbertson, asked Johnson to \u201cthink again\u201d on Uber, concerned that his relatively relaxed view about the firm was changing. Cuthbertson told the Guardian: \u201cThere are some concerns with Uber, such as its policy on insurance, but these proposals don\u2019t look at that. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019ve asked what are the key features of Uber that people like and how do we make them illegal?\u201d Johnson is said to be worried by the increased number of minicabs in the capital and the congestion this is causing. The number of licensed private hire vehicles has gone from around 35,000 in 2005 to just over 60,000 now. Simon Walker, director general of the business-friendly Institute of Directors, has appealed to Johnson to uphold his free market ideals over the situation. This article was amended on 2 October",

      "bodyText": "So much for starting October with a stock market rally. Trading is over for the day in Europe, and most of the main indices finished in the red. The clutch of downbeat factory surveys released through the day have reignited concerns over the global economy. Conner Campbell of SpreadEX nails it: Well, that didn\u2019t last long. The jubilant start to the fourth quarter proved to be as unwarranted as it always seemed, with a day full of dismal manufacturing data gradually wearing down even the most optimistic of investors. A quick recap of that dismal data: China\u2019s factory sector has shrunk at the fastest rate since 2009, In Europe, manufacturing growth has slowed in Germany and Spain UK factories are also seeing weaker conditions, forcing them to start cutting jobs, and in America, growth almost stalled last month. And that wiped 1.5% off Germany\u2019s DAX, and 0.6% off the French CAC. In the UK, the FTSE 100 ended 10 points higher. Traders are remain nervous ahead of tomorrow\u2019s US jobs report. points out Alastair McCaig of IG: Having rounded off such a miserable quarter it is understandable why traders have been a little reluctant to rush back into the markets. Throw into the mix that tomorrow will be the first Friday of the month, triggering the US to release the latest non-farm payrolls data, there has been a healthy amount of waiting and watching going on. And that\u2019s helping to push shares down in New York too: Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Wiesenthal has done a nice piece rounding up the good and bad economic news today. On the worrying side, manufacturing growth in the US, China, the eurozone and Vietnam have all slowed last month along with South African electricity consumption (just the sort of data that would catch Joe\u2019s eye). But there is better news too -- consumer confidence and residential housing both picked up last month. Joe writes: So there\u2019s your world economy in a nutshell. Emerging markets, China, manufacturing, etc. don\u2019t look very hot, but the twin engines of the U.S. economy -- consumers and housing -- continue unabated. The Executive Director at the Consumers\u2019 Association, Which?, believes Volkswagen should have acted faster to suspend car sales: Another Volkswagen development -- the firm\u2019s UK arm is suspending the sale of 4,000 vehicles in Britain. These cars could contain software at the heart of the emission scandal, so are being taken off the market until a fix is found. The BBC\u2019s industry and employment correspondent, John Moylan, has tweeted the details: Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Federal Reserve, has stirred the markets by predicting that US interest rates could be raised this month. Asked about the possibility of an October rate hike, Lacker told the Wall Street Journal that: \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d \u201cWe will have another labor market report [on Friday]. Presumably that will move us further toward labor market improvement.\u201d That\u2019s pushing shares a little lower on Wall Street, and also weighing on commodity prices: Today\u2019s ISM report shows that America\u2019s factories are \u201cbarely hanging on\u201d, says Steve Murphy of Capital Economics. The decline in the ISM manufacturing index to 50.2 in September from 51.1 in August is yet another illustration of the devastating impact that the strong dollar and weak foreign demand is having on the battered factory sector. Things might well get even worse before they begin to get better. He\u2019s worried by the drop in employment growth too: While manufacturing output has been no worse than stagnant, employment in the sector has begun to shrink in recent months. The decline in the employment index to 50.5 last month, from 51.2, points to further factory job losses. Europe\u2019s stock market rally is running out of steam - the FTSE 100 is now down 2 point, having been up 110 points early this morning. And Germany\u2019s FAX is down 1.5%, with half an hour to go. A much-awaited review of the Greek economy \u2013 vital to initiating talks on the country\u2019s debt problem - will begin this month, officials are saying. News of the audit was confirmed as Athens and its euro zone partners prepared to finalise the list of measures Greece must implement in return for being bailed out for a third time. Helena Smith reports. Greek financial media, citing senior EU officials, are reporting that the review - the first since the country was inducted into its third bailout programme - will begin in October. This review will determine if Athens receives a \u20ac3bn loan tranche; it would be paid in two tranches, once the Athens parliament has voted on and enforced a list of prior actions. Under the terms of the bailout accord, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 newly elected government has to implement as many as 105 prior actions, including structural reforms and budget cuts, by early November. The measures are expected to be fine-tuned at a meeting of senior euro zone finance ministry officials conducting a Euro Working Group teleconference call on Friday. They will then be formally approved at a Euro Group of euro area finance ministers on Monday. Tsipras and his leftist-led government have openly said they disagree with many of the measures - on the basis that they will exacerbate Greece\u2019s recession and debt deflationary cycle. But earlier this week the young prime minister repeated that he will enforce them so that talks on debt relief can begin once the review is concluded in the coming months. Here\u2019s the detail of today\u2019s US factory report, showing slower growth in new orders, production, employment, exports and imports: Yikes. Growth in America\u2019s factory sector all-but vanished last month, according to the monthly manufacturing report from the Institute of Supply Management. The ISM\u2019s US manufacturing PMI fell to just 50.2 in September, barely above the break-even mark, down from 51.1 in August. That\u2019s the lowest reading since May 2013, and lower than economists expected. The ISM reported that new orders, employment and import growth all fell last month, indicating that America experienced the same slowdown as China and Europe in September..... Over in Athens, Greeks have been told that debilitating capital controls may be lifted by the beginning of 2016. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports With the long-awaited recapitalization of the Greek banking system expected to begin next week, senior finance officials in Greece are predicting that capital controls could soon be ended. As the Union of Greek banks republished an updated version of the restrictions this afternoon, bankers said there were \u201cimproved hopes\u201d the controls would gradually be phased out. In an address last night to the Athens chamber of commerce, the president of the National Bank of Greece, Luka Katselli announced the restrictions could be lifted by the end of the year, if not early 2016, if the recapitalization process was concluded promptly. The European Central Bank is due to conduct stress tests of Greek banks, and an asset quality review, to determine exactly how much extra capital they require. Fears of the country\u2019s ejection from the euro zone triggered a massive run on deposits with Katselli estimating that around \u20ac118bn in deposits had fled the system between 2008 and 2015. Under the country\u2019s third EU-backed rescue programme, as much as \u20ac25bn have been earmarked for the recapitalization of the Greek banking system. The controls - imposed to avert a collapse of the financial system at the end of June - have been the death knell for thousands of small and medium sized businesses now unable to pay suppliers. Katselli said provided \u201cpolitical and economic stability\u201d were restored liquidity could finally be pumped into the real economy, adding: \u201c2015 will be a landmark year for the rebooting of the economy but for it to happen we must all work together.\u201d This morning\u2019s factory data showed the impact of capital controls. Output slumped in August and was still below the 50-point \u2018no change\u2019 mark in September. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index is down 0.75% in early trading too. Wall Street is making a muted start to the fourth quarter, as trading gets underway in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 16 points, or just 0.1%, at 16,269. Traders are digesting the news that Chinese factory output shrank again last month, while growth eased in Europe and the UK. They\u2019re also edgy ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report - a strong reading could put an early Fed rate hike back on the table..... One of Glencore\u2019s directors, John Mack, has shown he still believes in the company by snapping up 550,000 shares. Mack bought the shares on Tuesday, according to a stock market filing, the day after the mining and trading firm\u2019s share price slumped by 30% to a record low. That prompted Glencore to insist that it has a solid future, despite the commodities rout. Mack\u2019s move echoes chairman Tony Hayward, who bought 100,000 shares yesterday. Entertainly, Mack got a rather better price -- 81p, against Hayward\u2019s 90p. Timing is everything in the City.... After an early rally, Glencore shares are down 2.8% today at 89p. The number of American\u2019s signing on for unemployment benefits rose last week, according to the latest US weekly jobless figures which are hitting the wires now. This is our final glimpse into America\u2019s labour market before tomorrow\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll report. And they show that the initial claimant count rose to 277,000 last week, up from 277,000 a week earlier. That\u2019s still a fairly low figure, suggesting a robust labour market. Speaking of Volkswagen, German prosecutors say today that former CEO Martin Winterkorn isn\u2019t being formally investigated over fraud allegations. They just released a clarification of their earlier statement three days ago, saying they have no evidence of wrongdoing by Winterkorn. who quit a week ago. They said: \u201cThere is currently no formal investigation against Winterkorn. The Braunschweig prosecution regrets that this impression may have been created as well as the irritation that (Monday\u2019s) press release caused.\u201d On Monday, the prosecutors office said it was investigating Winterkorn over \u201callegations of fraud in the sale of cars with manipulated emissions data\u201d based on charges filed by about 10 unidentified individuals. The Volkswagen emissions scandal has the potential to hurt factories across Europe in the next few months. Italy\u2019s deputy industry minister, Carlo Calenda, is already worried. He told an event in Milan today that: \u201cThe risk is very big. Volkswagen is a group that buys a lot from Italy\u2019s supply chain, especially in the north-western part of the country.\u201d Meanwhile in the UK, a former minister has said diesel cars are \u201cliterally killing people\u201d, and that the government here blundered by encouraging drivers to switch from petrol. Investors struggled to avoid taking big losses in the last three months, whether they put money into stocks, gambled on commodities, or dabbled in the foreign exchange market. Government bonds were the place to be - especially Italian debt (BTPs), as this chart from Deutsche Bank shows. Wall Street is expected to open higher later today, despite these latest signs of manufacturing weakness around the globe. The Dow Jones industrial average is tipped to rally by around 100 points at the open, to 16376 points. Bad news appears to be good news for stocks today, if it means central bankers don\u2019t tighten monetary policy as fast. Brenda Kelly of London Capital Group explains: Eurozone manufacturing PMI was for the most part disappointing with only France managing to beat estimates, but this coupled with the fact that the euro area officially fell into deflation only boosts the notion that the ECB will provide additional monetary stimulus and potentially extend the current programme beyond September 2016. UK productivity problems might finally be easing. The Office for National Statistics has reported that output per hour worked rose by 0.9% in April to June, compared to the previous quarter. That takes productivity to the highest level on record, but it was still 15% below where it would have been without the financial crisis. This morning\u2019s flurry of mediocre factory data hasn\u2019t prevented Europe\u2019s stock markets from posting solid gains. The main indices are up at least 1%, as investors start the final quarter of 2015 in positive mood. Here\u2019s the state of play: Analysts say there is relief that China\u2019s manufacturing data wasn\u2019t worse. Plus, poor data may mean more stimulus measures, or less risk of interest rates being hiked. Neil Williams, chief economist at fund manager Hermes, has a good explanation (via Reuters). \u201cThe clouds are clearing a bit. Overall China is clearly slowing but what does give me comfort is that its policy dashboard has a lot more buttons to press on it than ours in Europe. \u201cI\u2019m now expecting China to cut quite aggressively its interest rates and reserve requirements, and even move towards a fiscal splurge.\u201d UK factories face some serious challenges right now, warns Mark Stephenson, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte, including: ....the recent high profile scrutiny on the automotive manufacturing sector; a strong Pound and weak Euro continuing to make for difficult export conditions and squeezed margins; and the prolonged period of economic volatility in China creating supply chain uncertainty and impacting demand. All of these factors mean that the remainder of the year could be challenging for the industry. Mike Rigby, head of manufacturing at Barclays, is alarmed that UK factories didn\u2019t perform better last month. \u201cWith virtually zero inflation, low unemployment and weak oil prices, manufacturing would have been looking to make up ground over the past quarter. He blames the weakening global economy: However, ongoing weakness in export orders, which is being exacerbated by the strength of sterling, continued lacklustre growth in the Eurozone as well as the slowdown in China, have continued to thwart export opportunities for manufacturers and the sector remains reliant on domestic demand to keep it steady.\u201d Britain\u2019s factory sector has also hit a stickier patch, with growth slowing and firms cutting jobs again. Data firm Markit reports that output growth hit a three-month low in September, with the manufacturing PMI falling to 51.5 from 51.6 in August. That\u2019s a \u201clacklustre\u201d performance, it says, partly due to a \u201cmarginal decrease in employment\u201d for the first time in two years. It\u2019s a fairly gloomy picture, as David Noble, CEO at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, explains: \u201cThe sector appears to be sidestepping any significant growth this month and offering little in the way of an upbeat performance, and unnerving those who expected a less disappointing result. Noble is particularly worried that the sector has stopped hiring new staff: \u201cThe domestic market continued to be the main contributor to any growth, though the export market showed a flicker of life as order levels improved marginally. The bigger worry is in staffing levels and it was not a good month for the intermediate goods producers on that score with that sector showing the biggest fall in employment. The overall employment index is now hovering just below the no-change mark, its lowest level for two-and-a-half years.\u201d Manufacturing growth across the eurozone has slowed to a five-month low, according to this morning\u2019s PMI reports. The overall eurozone manufacturing PMI, based in data from thousands of firms, has just come in at 52.0, down from 52.3 in August. That shows another month of growth, but not enough to tackle Europe\u2019s economic problems. \uf0a7Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit, said: \u201cDespite unprecedented central bank stimulus and substantial currency depreciation, the eurozone manufacturing sector is failing to achieve significant growth momentum and even risks stalling again. \u201cThe pace of expansion has been range-bound since the uplift following the start of QE earlier in the year, remaining disappointingly modest and even slipping to a five-month low in September.\u201d And worryingly for the European Central bank, factories are cutting prices again too. Not good for deflation. Markit says: Cost pressures shifted to the downside, however, with input costs and selling prices falling during the month. The report also slows that Greece\u2019s factory sector contracted sharply again, but at a slower rate than August\u2019s slump. That\u2019s the impact of capital controls, making it hard for firms to buy raw materials from overseas. Germany\u2019s factory growth has slowed with its manufacturing PMI dipping to 52.3 in September from 53.3 in August. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit, says: \u201cGermany\u2019s manufacturing sector lost some of its growth momentum in September, with the headline PMI down slightly since August.\u201d Firms reported a rise in new orders and output, but job creation has dipped. Good news from France! The factory sector is expanding again. The French PMI has crept back over the crucial 50-point mark to 50.6, showing the fastest growth in 18 months. It\u2019s not that great. Although output rose, new orders did fall and staffing levels were unchanged. But still, Markit says the sector is on a \u201cfirmer footing\u2019. Growth in Italy\u2019s factory sector has also slowed, with the Italian PMI dropping to 52.7 from 53.8. That\u2019s the slowest growth since February. The Spanish manufacturing PMI for September is just out, and it\u2019s not great. Spain\u2019s factory PMI fell to 51.7 last month, from a healthier 53.2 in August. That\u2019s the slowest rate of growth in 21 months. Markit, which compiled the report, found that new orders are rising at the slowest rate since December 2013, suggesting Spain\u2019s impressive recovery may be coming off the boil. Andrew Harker, senior economist at Markit, warns: The outlook for the remainder of the year is looking uncertain, but with macroeconomic risks skewed to the downside there is the possibility of outright declines in output and new orders being recorded. After several wild days, Glencore\u2019s share price has just clawed back this week\u2019s losses. They jumped almost 8% at the start of trading to 99p, back to the level before Monday\u2019s 30% slump. Glencore has been insisting that it is in better financial health than some analysts have claimed, despite the slump in commodities prices. Maybe the message is getting through... In the City, shares have jumped at the start of trading. The FTSE 100 is up 73 points, or 1.1%, at 6134, led by mining stocks such as Glencore and Rio Tinto. Traders are taking their cue from today\u2019s Chinese manufacturing reports, with relief that the official PMI survey showed that the slowdown has stabilised. But what about the gloomier Caixin report, showing the biggest decline since 2009? Well, that appears to be fuelling hopes that Beijing might embark on more stimulus measures soon. There\u2019s also relief that the Chinese stock market is now closed for a week. Tony Cross of Trustnet Direct explains: Some passable PMI data was released from China last night, with both the official and private readings posting contraction, but the rate wasn\u2019t quite as lows as had been expected. As a result we\u2019ve seen mining stocks driven to the top of the index although it\u2019s worth noting that with the Shanghai market now closed for the national day holiday, again this is removing some uncertainty from the equation. There are also signs of economic weakness in the latest survey of Japanese manufacturers, which shows a sharp drop in export orders. Japan\u2019s factory PMI slipped to 51.0 in September, showing weaker growth after August\u2019s 51.7. That\u2019s worrying.... however, the Japanese stock market has rallied today, by almost two percent. Traders may be anticipating yet more stimulus measures from the Bank of Japan to ward off a new recession. Two rival surveys of the Chinese factory sector have been released today, and both show that the slowdown continues. According to the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI, operating conditions are deteriorating at the fastest rate since March 2009. It found that production is still falling, forcing firms to lay off more jobs as unsold goods piled up. Here\u2019s their top line: Total new work fell at the quickest rate in over three years, partly driven by a steeper fall in new export business. As a result, companies cut output at the sharpest rate in six-and-a-half years, while staff numbers fell at the quickest pace since the start of 2009. Reduced production schedules also prompted firms to lower their purchasing activity again in September, while disappointing sales led to the strongest increase in stocks of finished goods for over three years. On the price front, both input costs and output charges fell at sharper rates. And that dragged the PMI down to 47.2 in September, from 47.3 in August, showing a sharper contraction. However, the official manufacturing PMI calculated by the Beijing government was less pessimistic -- although it also showed another contraction. It came in at 49.8, up from 49.7 in August, closer to the 50-point mark that shows that activity was unchanged. That could indicate that the slowdown is bottoming out. Zhang Liqun, researcher at the Development Research Center of the State Council (a government think tank) is optimistic, saying: \u201cThe figures showed that pro-growth policies are taking effect, pointing to signs of stabilizing for China\u2019s economy,\u201d It all depends which report you believe, really. The Caixin survey is seen as more independent, and may also give a better picture of how smaller Chinese firms are faring. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s PMI Day, when surveys of factory output across the world are released. Investors will be scrutinising these Purchasing Manager Indexes for signs that the economic slowdown continued in September. Poor data in Europe could raise the chances that the European Central Bank launches fresh stimulus measures. We might even spy signs that the Volkswagen emissions scandal has hurt German manufacturers (although it could be early days). And the US PMI report, due this afternoon, will help influence whether the Federal Reserve takes the plunge and raises interest rates next month. Here\u2019s some timings: Spanish Manufacturing PMI: 8am BST Italian Manufacturing PMI: 8.45am BST France Manufacturing PMI: 8.50am BST German Manufacturing PMI: 8.55am BST UK Manufacturing PMI: 9.30am BST US Manufacturing PMI: 3pm BST It\u2019s also the start of a new financial quarter. More than $10 trillion was wiped off global shares in the last three months, so investors will be hoping that Q4 gets off to a better start.",

The controls - imposed to avert a collapse of the financial system at the end of June - have been the death knell for thousands of small and medium sized businesses now unable to pay suppliers.</p> <p>Katselli said provided \u201cpolitical and economic stability\u201d were restored liquidity could finally be pumped into the real economy, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201c2015 will be a landmark year for the rebooting of the economy but for it to happen we must all work together.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/oct/01/stock-markets-rally-chinese-factory-output-eurozone-live#block-560ce8aae4b06a9994446ce3\">This morning\u2019s factory data</a> showed the impact of capital controls.

      "bodyText": "Quorn \u2013 the meat substitute which was once the preserve of vegetarians \u2013 is aiming for worldwide growth after being sold this week to a Philippines noodle firm for \u00a3550m. Food scandals, concerns about the environmental impact of farming livestock and an advertising campaign fronted by multiple gold medal-winning runner Mo Farah had already broadened Quorn\u2019s appeal beyond vegetarians. Three-quarters of the customers for the mycoprotein-based products \u2013 which are produced in West Yorkshire \u2013 are now meat eaters and the company has set its sights on health-conscious customers across Europe and the US. The buyer, Monde Nissin \u2013 best known for its instant noodles \u2013 tabled its winning bid after Quorn Foods had enjoyed its best-ever six months, with sales rising by 7% across the 23 countries where its products are sold. There were several potential buyers when Quorn\u2019s private equity owner Exponent hung up the for sale sign last month. Bidders were said to include Nomad Foods, the private owner of Bird\u2019s Eye and Findus, McCain, the world\u2019s largest producer of frozen chips along with KitKat maker Nestl\u00e9 and WhiteWave, the company behind Alpro soya milk. There are now big ambitions for Quorn, a product which derives from a single strain of fungi found in a field in Buckinghamshire in the 1960s. Lord J Arthur Rank, the flour-milling magnate and film studio executive, oversaw the project to develop a new source of protein in response to fears of a global food shortage. The fungi was fermented in an ICI lab, but it took more than a decade before Quorn arrived on plates. It is now eaten by 14 million people, but from its headquarters in Stokesley the company plans to increase exports to countries ranging from France to Australia. Quorn arrived in Germany, Finland and Denmark last year and will be launched in another European market before the end of the year. However, the most eye-catching growth has been in the US, since the world\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, Walmart, began selling Quorn in 2012. Demand for Quorn in the US is up 30% on last year and the company aims to triple its American business by 2020. \u201cYounger consumers everywhere around the world want to eat less meat and that creates a different category and a business opportunity for people like ourselves,\u201d says Kevin Brennan, chief executive of Quorn Foods. \u201cOne of the things we are quite proud of is that even though the pound has appreciated quite sharply, we are still growing.\u201d He thinks Quorn, which employs 650 staff, could become a billion-dollar business in 10-12 years, which would be a huge expansion of its 2014 sales of \u00a3150m. To Pinar Hosafci, senior food analyst at Euromonitor, $1bn sounds \u201ca bit far-fetched\u201d, but she reckons the company could grow to $800m over a similar period. According to unpublished preliminary data from Euromonitor, the global market for meat substitutes will be worth $2.5bn in 2020, up from $1.4bn in 2014. \u201cIt is a lucrative market, but it doesn\u2019t come without risks,\u201d Hosafci adds. \u201cOne of the problems of meat substitutes in general is that some consumers might perceive them as artificial and they don\u2019t fully mimic the taste and texture of meat.\u201d But, perceptions are shifting. Laura Jones, global food science analyst at Mintel, said meat-substitute products have started to lose the stigma of being \u201ctasteless cardboard\u201d. \u201cPeople used to think, \u2018why would you try to create a vegetarian sausage\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now they are starting to compete on a taste basis.\u201d Quorn has come along way since the first mycoprotein \u201cchicken\u201d pie, which arrived on Sainsbury\u2019s shelves in 1985. The company has spent years tinkering with recipes to improve taste and texture \u2013 Quorn mince, the company\u2019s biggest selling product, has been \u201cimproved\u201d seven times in 10 years. \u201cThe early product was a bit brutal,\u201d admits Brennan. Unsurprisingly he is a fan of his product, which comes in more than 100 varieties including sausages, bacon, gammon steaks and chorizo, together with Swedish meatballs and German Frankfurters, specially crafted for overseas markets. The process of growing and fermenting mycoprotein into Quorn is similar to making beer or yogurt. Fermentation produces a white doughy paste \u2013 around 22,000 tonnes of it every year. At Stokesley, the paste is mixed with spices in giant steel tubs, before being heated, frozen and moulded into slabs, roast dinner-style chunks (called chubs in the trade) or bite-sized pieces. Freezing is a vital step, as the ice crystals help to give the product a chewy texture similar to meat. The new owners will be critical in determining whether Quorn meets its ambitious sales goals. \u201cIf the new owner has an established distribution network, that enables them to push the brand in several markets and expand the geography,\u201d says Hosafci. But she also stresses that products such as Quorn still account for less than 1% of processed meat sales. \u201cIt\u2019s not like all of a sudden frozen meat substitutes are going to overtake processed meat products.\u201d Even if the world doesn\u2019t give up steak and sausages, the boss of Quorn still thinks plenty of people will be looking to cut back on animal protein. Quorn\u2019s typical customer may not be the 60-year-old Parisian, but his son or daughter, Brennan says. \u201cThat\u2019s quite generational, so we are not [only] anticipating growth for a couple of years, we see these trends continuing for decades.\u201d",

Three-quarters of the customers for the mycoprotein-based products \u2013 which are produced in West Yorkshire \u2013 are now meat eaters and the company has set its sights on health-conscious customers across Europe and the US.</p> <p>The buyer, Monde Nissin \u2013 best known for its instant noodles \u2013 tabled its winning bid after Quorn Foods had enjoyed its best-ever six months, with sales rising by 7% across the 23 countries where its products are sold. There were several potential buyers when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/oct/03/premier-foods-quorn-sale\">Quorn\u2019s private equity owner Exponent hung up the for sale sign last month</a>. Bidders were said to include Nomad Foods, the private owner of Bird\u2019s Eye and Findus, McCain, the world\u2019s largest producer of frozen chips along with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/02/nestle-quorn-premier-foods\">KitKat maker Nestl\u00e9 and WhiteWave</a>, the company behind Alpro soya milk.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>There are now big ambitions for Quorn, a product which derives from a single strain of fungi found in a field in Buckinghamshire in the 1960s. Lord J Arthur Rank, the flour-milling magnate and film studio executive, oversaw the project to develop a new source of protein in response to fears of a global food shortage. The fungi was fermented in an ICI lab, but it took more than a decade before Quorn arrived on plates.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>It is now eaten by 14 million people, but from its headquarters in Stokesley the company plans to increase exports to countries ranging from France to Australia.</p> <p>Quorn arrived in Germany, Finland and Denmark last year and will be launched in another European market before the end of the year.<br></p> <p>However, the most eye-catching growth has been in the US, since the world\u2019s biggest supermarket chain, Walmart, began selling Quorn in 2012. Demand for Quorn in the US is up 30% on last year and the company aims to triple its American business by 2020.</p> <p>\u201cYounger consumers everywhere around the world want to eat less meat and that creates a different category and a business opportunity for people like ourselves,\u201d says Kevin Brennan, chief executive of Quorn Foods.<br></p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we are quite proud of is that even though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/03/strong-pound-holding-back-uk-exports-says-key-survey\">the pound has appreciated quite sharply</a>, we are still growing.\u201d </p> <p>He thinks Quorn, which employs 650 staff, could become a billion-dollar business in 10-12 years, which would be a huge expansion of its 2014 sales of \u00a3150m.</p> <p>To Pinar Hosafci, senior food analyst at Euromonitor, $1bn sounds \u201ca bit far-fetched\u201d, but she reckons the company could grow to $800m over a similar period.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>According to unpublished preliminary data from Euromonitor, the global market for meat substitutes will be worth $2.5bn in 2020, up from $1.4bn in 2014.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt is a lucrative market, but it doesn\u2019t come without risks,\u201d Hosafci adds. \u201cOne of the problems of meat substitutes in general is that some consumers might perceive them as artificial and they don\u2019t fully mimic the taste and texture of meat.\u201d</p> <p>But, perceptions are shifting. Laura Jones, global food science analyst at Mintel, said meat-substitute products have started to lose the stigma of being \u201ctasteless cardboard\u201d. \u201cPeople used to think, \u2018why would you try to create a vegetarian sausage\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now they are starting to compete on a taste basis.\u201d</p> <p>Quorn has come along way since the first mycoprotein \u201cchicken\u201d pie, which arrived on Sainsbury\u2019s shelves in 1985. The company has spent years tinkering with recipes to improve taste and texture \u2013 Quorn mince, the company\u2019s biggest selling product, has been \u201cimproved\u201d seven times in 10 years.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe early product was a bit brutal,\u201d admits Brennan. Unsurprisingly he is a fan of his product, which comes in more than 100 varieties including sausages, bacon, gammon steaks and chorizo, together with Swedish meatballs and German Frankfurters, specially crafted for overseas markets.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The process of growing and fermenting mycoprotein into Quorn is similar to making beer or yogurt. Fermentation produces a white doughy paste \u2013 around 22,000 tonnes of it every year. At Stokesley, the paste is mixed with spices in giant steel tubs, before being heated, frozen and moulded into slabs, roast dinner-style chunks (called chubs in the trade) or bite-sized pieces.</p> <p>Freezing is a vital step, as the ice crystals help to give the product a chewy texture similar to meat.<br></p> <p>The new owners will be critical in determining whether Quorn meets its ambitious sales goals. \u201cIf the new owner has an established distribution network, that enables them to push the brand in several markets and expand the geography,\u201d says Hosafci.</p> <p>But she also stresses that products such as Quorn still account for less than 1% of processed meat sales. \u201cIt\u2019s not like all of a sudden frozen meat substitutes are going to overtake processed meat products.\u201d</p> <p>Even if the world doesn\u2019t give up steak and sausages, the boss of Quorn still thinks plenty of people will be looking to cut back on animal protein.</p> <p>Quorn\u2019s typical customer may not be the 60-year-old Parisian, but his son or daughter, Brennan says. \u201cThat\u2019s quite generational, so we are not [only] anticipating growth for a couple of years, we see these trends continuing for decades.\u201d</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has admitted that it continued selling new cars in the UK fitted with \u201cdefeat devices\u201d to cheat diesel emissions tests even after US authorities uncovered the scandal. The revelation piles pressure on the German carmaker. Richard Lloyd, executive director at consumer group Which?, accused VW of \u201cadding insult to injury\u201d for consumers. VW revealed on Thursday that it had suspended the sale of 4,000 new vehicles in the UK due to fears that they contained the same software used to deceive testing procedures in the US. This means that customers had been able to buy the cars until Wednesday, almost two weeks after the scandal began. A spokesman for VW said it did not know how many affected cars had been sold during the period but that it \u201cregrets\u201d that customers had bought them and would now have to get their vehicles fixed. Customers who are in the process of buying an affected car will be able to pull out or choose another VW vehicle. The spokesman said it had \u201ctaken time\u201d to identify affected vehicles. The 4,000 cars, which represent about 3% of the car group\u2019s UK stock, cover the VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat brands. They are fitted with the same EA 189 EU5 engine that is in the 1.2m vehicles that the company recalled on Wednesday. VW will continue to sell unaffected cars, which includes those fitted with the new EU6 engine. Earlier on Thursday, the former UK science minister Lord Drayson admitted that the Labour government\u2019s support for diesel cars had been a mistake and warned that diesel cars were \u201cliterally killing people\u201d. He called for a new diesel car scrappage scheme to encourage owners to trade them in for cleaner models. However, the car industry launched a robust defence of diesel engines and its practices. Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault-Nissan and president of Acea, the trade body for the European car industry, urged regulators not to punish the entire sector for the VW scandal. In a letter to EU policymakers, Ghosn said there had not been \u201cfull scale cheating\u201d across the industry. The head of the Society of Motor Manufacturer and Traders in Britain said the VW crisis should not cloud the benefits of diesel engines. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the trade body, told the National Air Quality Conference: \u201cConsumers are right to be concerned following the events of the past 10 days. But we must remember, the actions of one company do not mean collusion. Implicating other brands or companies would be unfair and wrong.\u201d \u201cIt would be wrong to penalise all diesels. The latest diesel vehicles are the cleanest ever, effectively reducing nitrogen oxide levels by 92% compared with earlier generations. They make a significant contribution to climate change targets, an environmental challenge which cannot be ignored.\u201d Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker, has signalled its support for diesel. The company is pressing ahead with plans to launch diesel cars in the US, where the claims against VW first emerged. JLR launched its first diesel-engine models, the 2016 Range Rover and 2016 Range Rover Discovery, just two weeks ago in the US. However, Joachim Eberhardt, president of JLR North America, said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to change our strategy.\u201d But Drayson, Britain\u2019s science minister from 2008-10 in Gordon Brown\u2019s government, urged the car industry to accelerate the development of electric vehicles. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Drayson said: \u201cWe did get it wrong. We now have a much better understanding than we did just a few years ago of what are the health effects of the products of diesel cars and they are literally killing people so it\u2019s clear that in retrospect that was the wrong policy.\u201d Brown introduced tax breaks for diesel cars as the UK chancellor in 2001 because they emit less CO2 than petrol-powered cars, but it is now known that they emit other harmful pollutants, known as nitrogen oxides. Drayson said that because about half of cars on the road in the UK and Europe are diesels, action must be taken quickly. VW has confirmed that 11m vehicles worldwide possess the illegal defeat device, which lower nitrogen oxide emissions in test conditions but allows high emissions on the open road. Owners will be contacted in the coming weeks and asked to take their cars to VW garages for a fix which some experts say could affect the performance of the cars. The company has set aside \u20ac6.5bn (\u00a34.8bn) to fix the affected cars. However, it also faces penalties in the US that could total $18bn (\u00a311.bn), while British law firms say they have been inundated with enquiries from VW drivers about making claims. VW said an internal investigation into the scandal led by law firm Jones Day would take \u201cat least several months\u201d and confirmed the creation of a new committee to manage the crisis. The VW board said it wanted to name Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, a former finance director, as chairman of the group following the departure of Ferdinand Pi\u00ebch earlier this year. However, concerns are growing about how VW will pay the fines and compensation claims that could emerge from the crisis. Max Warburton, analyst at Bernstein, said the worst case scenario in the US for VW was a fine of $7.4bn (\u00a34.9bn) from the Environmental Protection Agency, but he said it facedother costs around the world. Warburton said: \u201cThe company has a fairly robust balance sheet \u2013 but also has a very conservative approach to financing and its credit rating. We believe that if the cash costs exceed \u20ac10bn, a capital raise is highly likely.\u201d VW has already slowed production at one of its biggest engine factories and frozen hiring at its finance unit, which offers loans to buy new cars.",

      "bodyText": "Former science minister Lord Drayson has admitted that the Labour government\u2019s support for diesel cars was a mistake, and warned that diesels are \u201cliterally killing people\u201d. The comments came a day after Volkswagen, the world\u2019s biggest carmaker, admitted that almost 1.2m vehicles in the UK were involved in the diesel emissions scandal that has rocked the company. This means more than one-in-10 diesel cars on Britain\u2019s roads are affected. Overnight, it emerged that Volkswagen in Australia faces being hauled before an court and fined by the consumer watchdog if pollution-cheating software is found in the country\u2019s cars. Gordon Brown introduced tax breaks for diesel cars as the UK chancellor in 2001 because they emit less CO2 than petrol-powered cars, but it is now known that they emit other harmful pollutants, known as nitrogen oxides. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Drayson, who was science minister from 2008-10 in Brown\u2019s government, admitted: \u201cWe did get it wrong. We now have a much better understanding than we did just a few years ago of what are the health effects of the products of diesel cars and they are literally killing people so it\u2019s clear that in retrospect that was the wrong policy.\u201d He said that because about half of cars on the road in the UK and Europe are diesels, action must be taken quickly. He urged the car industry to accelerate the development of electric vehicles. Drayson, a businessman with a longstanding interest in clean energy and electric cars, called for vehicle exclusion zones in cities, more rigorous independent testing of diesel cars \u2013 and a new car scrappage scheme for diesels. He noted that the UK\u2019s last scrappage scheme, which was introduced in 2009 to boost the economy, had been very successful. A recent study commissioned by the Greater London Authority and Transport for London concluded that almost 9,500 people die prematurely each year in the capital due to air pollution, with diesel exhaust a major contributor. The City of London Corporation is working with taxi companies to go \u201celectric only\u201d in key areas of the financial district, building on other initiatives such as banning idling engines and introducing a 20pmh zone. Wendy Mead, who chairs the corporation\u2019s environment committee, said: \u201cDiesel was sold as an environmental solution but it is in fact an invisible killer. There are a range of proposals for reform of the UK\u2019s air quality strategy, but we urgently need to move further and faster on reducing pollution from diesel vehicles.\u201d The UK Green party said it is \u201cvital that the scrappage scheme [Drayson] calls for must not reward cheating carmakers with new profits\u201d. Local transport spokeswoman Caroline Russell urged the government to spend any fines given to carmakers caught cheating emission tests on improving public transport and walking and cycling facilities. Drayson\u2019s comments came as the updated UK consumer rights act took effect. It opens the door to US-style class-action lawsuits, by introducing an \u201copt-out\u201d scheme meaning that everyone affected is automatically a member of the \u201cclass\u201d which is suing. Consumer groups have welcomed this as a big step forward in helping people get compensation from companies, but the CBI business lobby group warned that the opt-out scheme risked worsening the high liability costs in the UK. German media reported that the criminal investigation launched in Braunschweig this week does not centre on Volkswagen\u2019s former chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, but on other, unnamed employees of the carmaker. Winterkorn stood down last week after nearly nine years at VW\u2019s helm, but insisted he did not know about the manipulation of emissions tests. Professor Richard Folkson, president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, warned against responding to the Volkswagen crisis with knee-jerk reactions, and casting diesel aside. \u201cThis is the time to look closely at the information as it emerges and take more considered views on the best way forward. We should not be rushing to scrap diesel cars when they clearly make a considerable contribution to reducing carbon emissions in the UK. If all new fossil fuel cars were to be solely petrol tomorrow for example, our average carbon emissions would increase by 16%. That cannot be in our interests as we approach COP21 in Paris in December where we are seeking to limit our impact on climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we need is a rapid introduction of a new testing regime that much more accurately reflects driver behaviour. We engineers should then carry on doing what we have been doing successfully for the last 40 years which is to improve both the engines and the exhaust treatment systems to mean emissions for all engine types continue to reduce. Diesel has many attractive characteristics which means it is going to be part of that progress. This is not the time to restrict our choices by casting it aside.\u201d Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, is also expected to mount a defence of diesel cars at the National Air Quality Conference in Birmingham later on Thursday, arguing that the latest diesel vehicles are the cleanest ever.",

He urged the car industry to accelerate the development of electric vehicles.</p> <p>Drayson, a businessman with a longstanding interest in clean energy and electric cars, called for vehicle exclusion zones in cities, more rigorous independent testing of diesel cars \u2013 and a new car scrappage scheme for diesels.

Winterkorn stood down last week after nearly nine years at VW\u2019s helm, but insisted he did not know about the manipulation of emissions tests.</p> <p>Professor Richard Folkson, president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, warned against responding to the Volkswagen crisis with knee-jerk reactions, and casting diesel aside.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the time to look closely at the information as it emerges and take more considered views on the best way forward. We should not be rushing to scrap diesel cars when they clearly make a considerable contribution to reducing carbon emissions in the UK. If all new fossil fuel cars were to be solely petrol tomorrow for example, our average carbon emissions would increase by 16%. That cannot be in our interests as we approach COP21 in Paris in December where we are seeking to limit our impact on climate change,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we need is a rapid introduction of a new testing regime that much more accurately reflects driver behaviour. We engineers should then carry on doing what we have been doing successfully for the last 40 years which is to improve both the engines and the exhaust treatment systems to mean emissions for all engine types continue to reduce. Diesel has many attractive characteristics which means it is going to be part of that progress. This is not the time to restrict our choices by casting it aside.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, is also expected to mount a defence of diesel cars at the National Air Quality Conference in Birmingham later on Thursday, arguing that the latest diesel vehicles are the cleanest ever.</p>",

    "webTitle": "The word 'reform' should be banished from the economic summit | Greg Jericho", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Earlier this week, Malcolm Turnbull sought to present himself as being on the economic front foot by calling a snap economic summit to seek a consensus on \u201creform priorities\u201d. That anything other than symbolism could be achieved in a two-to-three hour mini talkfest is debatable, but one major step forward would occur were the new prime minister to announce the banishment of the word \u201creform\u201d. The use of reform has long been one of my greatest bugbears. The word is so loaded with spin that it is meaningless. And yet such is its power that, to paraphrase Godwin\u2019s law (call it Jericho\u2019s law of economic debate), \u201cthe longer any speech or opinion article on Australia\u2019s economic future goes, the greater the probability of the speaker calling for reform\u201d. Newspapers are filled with pieces bemoaning the lack of reform, and arguing that without great change, reform will be unable to occur. Well rubbish, says I. Just three years ago, the government introduced a price on a substance which up till then had been effectively free. Despite having a huge negative externality (ie a negative impact that was not reflected in the price), carbon emissions in this country had no price. The ALP government put a price on them, set up a framework by which that price would shift from fixed to floating, and it was done in a way in which the economy continued to grow, and our emissions fell markedly. It was a policy which affected virtually all aspects of our economy, but achieved its aims in a much more economically efficient manner than otherwise proposed. If you don\u2019t believe that was a reform then you forfeit your right to use the word. But that\u2019s the point about the word \u2013 our current minister for the environment would not consider the carbon price a reform. It highlights, as I have written previously, that \u201creform\u201d just means \u201cpolicy that I agree with\u201d. Was the carbon price dumped because our \u201creform culture\u201d is dead? Did our combative polity, or the 24-hour news cycle or social media kill it? Or was it because Julia Gillard foolishly said she would not introduce a carbon tax and then even more foolishly agreed that if you wanted to call what she introduced a carbon tax then that was OK? Sure our political system is filled with bile and our media is angry, but maybe our politicians just haven\u2019t been good enough? But none of that negates the fact that reform is a meaningless word and the challenge to any participant at the economic summit, or anyone who writes or speaks on economics, is to argue for their favoured policy without using the word. Alas it would seem right this moment we have a secretary to the Treasury in John Fraser who would fail such a test. In a recent speech on \u201cAustralia\u2019s long-term economic challenges\u201d he used the word reform 40 times. He talked of \u201cstructural reforms\u201d, \u201csupply-side reform\u201d, \u201croad reform\u201d, \u201cworkplace relations reform\u201d, \u201ccompetition reform\u201d, \u201cfundamental reforms,\u201d \u201ctax reforms\u201d and even \u201creform-focused efficient taxes\u201d. Yes, taxes that have a focus on reform. A more meaningless phrase of economic jargon could scarcely be contrived, and yet this is what is uttered by the man charged with advising our government on economic matters. Fraser has also recently stated his belief in the need for austerity \u2013 telling the Financial Review that \u201ctough policies can beget good growth\u201d, which is fine so long as you ignore the reality that the UK\u2019s best growth occurred once they stopped the tough policies. Fraser also suggested that the US unemployment rate of 5.5% was \u201ctestimony to their more flexible product and labour markets\u201d. As Scott Steel, an economist for Queensland\u2019s public sector union noted, that flew in the face of research which has shown that the US\u2019s industrial relations model failed miserably during the global financial crisis. It also paints an absurdly rosy picture of the US employment situation compared to Australia. In January 2008, 62.9% of American adults were employed, now it is 3.5 percentage points lower at 59.4%. By comparison Australia\u2019s employment to population ratio is now just 1.75 points lower than it was in January 2008: And a major reason the US\u2019s unemployment rate is 5.5% is because the number of people looking for work has dramatically fallen over the past six years. Prior to the GFC, the US had a higher participation rate than Australia, now ours is nearly 2.5 percentage points higher: When comparing Australia and the US\u2019s employment performance over the past six years, the only way you could look favourably at America is if you think ideology trumps evidence. Moreover, as I noted at the time, Fraser\u2019s talk of flexibility also flies in the face of the findings of the Productivity Commission\u2019s draft report into the workplace relations framework which found that \u201ccontrary to perceptions, Australia\u2019s labour market performance and flexibility is relatively good by global standards, and many of the concerns that pervaded historical arrangements have now abated\u201d. It also noted that \u201cwages are responsive to economic downturns and there are multiple forms of employment arrangements that offer employees and employers flexible options for working\u201d. It\u2019s a bit of a worry that one of those pushing such perceptions is the head of Treasury. As I have also noted before, the desire for industrial relations reform is one of the biggest abuses of the word \u201creform\u201d. There is close to bugger-all evidence that can link the workplace relations system, let alone flexibility, to improved productivity \u2013 certainly no data over the past 15 years can: But the Treasury itself seems clueless as to what constitutes productivity. In May when Treasury was negotiating a new staff enterprise agreement, a Treasury spokesperson outlined three \u201cproductivity offsets\u201d that staff had to agree with to get the pay rise. The three offsets were increasing the standard work week from 37.5 hours to 38, removing the half-day shutdown on the last working day before Christmas and having one formal appraisal per year for executive level staff. That\u2019s all great, except they have nothing to do with productivity. Getting people to work longer hours might improve profitability, it may reduce labour costs in a government department, but it has nothing to do with increasing output per hour worked. And this type of crud comes out of the Treasury! Such a use is a direct result of very serious people in politics and the media over the past decade or so stripping actual meaning from words like reform and productivity instead turning them into smart sounding buzzwords. You want to change Australia\u2019s tax system, our IR system, our competition laws? Great, but tell us why and how that will improve our economy, and tell us who will be affected and how. If you need to say it will improve productivity, tell us how and explain what you mean by that word \u2013 because profit does not equal productivity. And if you use the word \u201creform\u201d \u2013 you fail.",

And yet such is its power that, to paraphrase Godwin\u2019s law (call it Jericho\u2019s law of economic debate), \u201cthe longer any speech or opinion article on Australia\u2019s economic future goes, the greater the probability of the speaker calling for reform\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/01/emissions-target-will-require-major-changes-to-direct-action-say-experts\">Questions over Direct Action as Greg Hunt reveals Paris target needs industrial emissions cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Newspapers are filled with pieces bemoaning the lack of reform, and arguing that without great change, reform will be unable to occur. </p> <p>Well rubbish, says I. </p> <p>Just three years ago, the government introduced a price on a substance which up till then had been effectively free. Despite having a huge negative externality (ie a negative impact that was not reflected in the price), carbon emissions in this country had no price. The ALP government put a price on them, set up a framework by which that price would shift from fixed to floating, and it was done in a way in which the economy continued to grow, and our emissions fell markedly. </p> <p>It was a policy which affected virtually all aspects of our economy, but achieved its aims in a much more economically efficient manner than otherwise proposed. If you don\u2019t believe that was a reform then you forfeit your right to use the word. </p> <p>But that\u2019s the point about the word \u2013 our current minister for the environment would not consider the carbon price a reform. </p> <p>It highlights, as I have written previously, that \u201creform\u201d just means \u201cpolicy that I agree with\u201d.</p> <p>Was the carbon price dumped because our \u201creform culture\u201d is dead? Did our combative polity, or the 24-hour news cycle or social media kill it? </p> <p>Or was it because Julia Gillard foolishly said she would not introduce a carbon tax and then even more foolishly agreed that if you wanted to call what she introduced a carbon tax then that was OK?</p> <p>Sure our political system is filled with bile and our media is angry, but maybe our politicians just haven\u2019t been good enough?</p> <p>But none of that negates the fact that reform is a meaningless word and the challenge to any participant at the economic summit, or anyone who writes or speaks on economics, is to argue for their favoured policy without using the word. </p> <p>Alas it would seem right this moment we have a secretary to the Treasury in John Fraser who would fail such a test. In a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.treasury.gov.au/PublicationsAndMedia/Speeches/2015/Australias-longerterm-economic-challenges\">recent speech</a> on \u201cAustralia\u2019s long-term economic challenges\u201d he used the word reform 40 times. </p> <p>He talked of \u201cstructural reforms\u201d, \u201csupply-side reform\u201d, \u201croad reform\u201d, \u201cworkplace relations reform\u201d, \u201ccompetition reform\u201d, \u201cfundamental reforms,\u201d \u201ctax reforms\u201d and even \u201creform-focused efficient taxes\u201d.</p> <p>Yes, taxes that have a focus on reform. </p> <p>A more meaningless phrase of economic jargon could scarcely be contrived, and yet this is what is uttered by the man charged with advising our government on economic matters. </p> <p>Fraser has also recently stated his belief in the need for austerity \u2013 telling the <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/economy/treasury-head-john-fraser-warns-australia-risks-falling-behind-20150924-gjtuhv?stb=twt\">Financial Review</a> that \u201ctough policies can beget good growth\u201d, which is fine so long as you ignore the reality that the UK\u2019s best growth occurred once they stopped the tough policies. </p> <p>Fraser also suggested that the US unemployment rate of 5.5% was \u201ctestimony to their more flexible product and labour markets\u201d. </p> <p>As Scott Steel, an economist for Queensland\u2019s public sector union noted, that flew in the face of <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w19587\">research</a> which has shown that the US\u2019s industrial relations model failed miserably during the global financial crisis. It also paints an absurdly rosy picture of the US employment situation compared to Australia. </p> <p>In January 2008, 62.9% of American adults were employed, now it is 3.5 percentage points lower at 59.4%. By comparison Australia\u2019s employment to population ratio is now just 1.75 points lower than it was in January 2008:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Employment to population ratio, US and Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TZWJg/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And a major reason the US\u2019s unemployment rate is 5.5% is because the number of people looking for work has dramatically fallen over the past six years. </p> <p>Prior to the GFC, the US had a higher participation rate than Australia, now ours is nearly 2.5 percentage points higher:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Participation rate - US and Australia\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/amcHA/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When comparing Australia and the US\u2019s employment performance over the past six years, the only way you could look favourably at America is if you think ideology trumps evidence.</p> <p>Moreover, as I noted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/aug/06/its-nonsense-to-believe-more-flexibility-leads-to-greater-productivity\">at the time</a>, Fraser\u2019s talk of flexibility also flies in the face of the findings of the Productivity Commission\u2019s draft report into the workplace relations framework which found that \u201ccontrary to perceptions, Australia\u2019s labour market performance and flexibility is relatively good by global standards, and many of the concerns that pervaded historical arrangements have now abated\u201d. </p> <p>It also noted that \u201cwages are responsive to economic downturns and there are multiple forms of employment arrangements that offer employees and employers flexible options for working\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit of a worry that one of those pushing such perceptions is the head of Treasury. </p> <p>As I have also noted before, the desire for industrial relations reform is one of the biggest abuses of the word \u201creform\u201d. There is close to bugger-all evidence that can link the workplace relations system, let alone flexibility, to improved productivity \u2013 certainly no data over the past 15 years can: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Productivity growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PyZbj/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the Treasury itself seems clueless as to what constitutes productivity. In May when Treasury was negotiating a new staff enterprise agreement, a Treasury spokesperson outlined three \u201c<a href=\"http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/treasury-public-servants-fare-better-than-most-with-pay-offer-20150514-gh1biz.html\">productivity offsets</a>\u201d that staff had to agree with to get the pay rise.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/30/debate-about-how-big-government-should-be-is-the-next-political-battlefield\">Debate about how big government should be is the next political battlefield</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The three offsets were increasing the standard work week from 37.5 hours to 38, removing the half-day shutdown on the last working day before Christmas and having one formal appraisal per year for executive level staff. </p> <p>That\u2019s all great, except they have nothing to do with productivity. Getting people to work longer hours might improve profitability, it may reduce labour costs in a government department, but it has nothing to do with increasing output per hour worked. </p> <p>And this type of crud comes out of the Treasury! </p> <p>Such a use is a direct result of <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/?s=very+serious+people&amp;_r=0\">very serious people</a> in politics and the media over the past decade or so stripping actual meaning from words like reform and productivity instead turning them into smart sounding buzzwords.</p> <p>You want to change Australia\u2019s tax system, our IR system, our competition laws? Great, but tell us why and how that will improve our economy, and tell us who will be affected and how. If you need to say it will improve productivity, tell us how and explain what you mean by that word \u2013 because profit does not equal productivity. </p> <p>And if you use the word \u201creform\u201d \u2013 you fail. </p>",
