      "bodyText": "Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GlaxoSmithKline, will on Wednesday speak publicly for the first time about the cash and sexual bribery scandal that has led to the arrest of four of the company's senior Chinese executives. Britain's biggest drug company has admitted some of its executives have broken the law, but has failed to explain who did it, what they did, when they did it or how long the company has known about it. Here are eight questions that Witty \u2013 who was paid \u00a33.9m last year \u2013 should answer when he speaks to the media on a conference call on Wednesday. What have GSK staff actually done? The Chinese authorities have accused GSK of acting like a criminal \"godfather\", using a network of 700 middlemen and travel agencies to bribe doctors with \u00a3320m cash and sexual favours in return for prescribing GSK drugs. Gao Feng, head of China's fraud unit, said: \"In order to win the favour of GSK, some travel agencies don't just offer money to their [clients], but also sexual bribes.\" GSK has admitted only that \"certain senior executives who know our systems well appear to have acted outside of our processes and controls which breaches Chinese law\". But it has refused to explain exactly what they did or how the alleged bribery worked, despite one of the detained executives admitting to the charges on Chinese state television. How long have GSK China executives been allegedly breaking the law? Gao said the police have evidence that bribery has been a \"core part\" of GSK China's business model since 2007. GSK said it was \"deeply concerned and disappointed\" by the allegations, but it has refused to say how long the alleged bribery has been going on. How much did GSK pay out in bribes? Did this inflate the price of GSK's drugs to patients? Gao claims GSK spent 3bn yuan (\u00a3320m) on bribes. GSK has refused to comment. One of the arrested executives, Liang Hong, told Chinese state TV that it raised prices Chinese consumers pay for GSK's drugs by up to 30%. Abbas Hussain, the company's head of emerging markets who was dispatched to Shanghai to oversee the crisis, has promised it will cut the price of its drugs in China. When did GSK first become aware of these allegations and why did Witty not address accusations of wrongdoing in China earlier? The Chinese authorities announced the charges and arrested the four GSK executives on 15 July \u2013 this was just a week after the company said a four-month internal investigation found \"no evidence of corruption or bribery in our China business\". That internal investigation was prompted by a whistleblower who wrote to GSK's board this year alleging that Chinese sales staff had been engaged in the \"widespread bribery of doctors to prescribe drugs\". GSK's operations in China have long been plagued by allegations of bribery and corruption. Last year, GSK sacked 56 employees in China for violating its rules, out of a worldwide total of 312 dismissals. The New York Times claims it has seen an internal audit showing GSK was warned about serious problems in its Chinese research and development facilities as early as November 2011. The report includes a claim that GSK failed to release the results of a drug trial on mice when it was already testing the drug on humans. How far up the corporate food chain did the corruption reach? GSK has refused to say how many of its executives appear to have breached Chinese laws, or name any individuals it suspects. Sources close to the company suggest the allegations are restricted to the four Chinese executives detained by the police. However, the Chinese police are preventing GSK China's British finance director Steve Nechelput from leaving the country, and want Mark Reilly, the British boss of GSK China, to return to Shanghai. GSK has refused to comment on whether Nechelput or Reilly were involved or aware of the bribery allegations. The company has also refused to say if or when Reilly will return to China. What will Witty do to clean up GSK's Chinese operations? Hussain said GSK is taking the charges \"extremely seriously\" and will take \"all necessary actions to \u2026 root out corruption wherever it exists\", but the company has not so far given any details of specific measures it will take. What information has GSK passed to the Serious Fraud Office? GSK said it is regularly briefing the SFO, but has not said what information it has passed on. Can Witty assure shareholders that staff in other countries are not bribing doctors? Last year GSK paid a $3bn (\u00a31.9bn) fine in the US to settle claims that it tricked and bribed doctors into prescribing dangerous antidepressants to children. After the settlement Witty vowed that a company-wide overhaul would prevent a repeat of the scandal.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "April 2013. The skies are leaden, the City is alive with speculation that Britain is heading for a triple-dip recession and the Conservatives are braced for a trouncing in the local elections. Three months on and the sun is shining, the markets are braced for the strongest growth figures for three years and Labour is the party with problems. No question, the second quarter data will be strong. Take it as read that they will be milked by David Cameron and George Osborne. A heatwave; a royal baby; sporting success; evidence that the economy has turned the corner: for Conservative strategists trying to generate a feelgood factor, it could hardly get better. This is 1982 redux; the moment when the clouds lift after a painful recession, with the government getting the political benefit from sticking to an unpopular but necessary strategy. Well, perhaps. Alternative historical reference points could be 1978 \u2013 the brief interlude between the sterling crisis of 1976 and the manufacturing meltdown of 1980-81, or 1972-3 when Ted Heath's government embarked on an ill-fated dash for growth after unemployment rose above one million for the first time since the second world war. The pickup in growth has been a long time in coming. Even a 1% increase in gross domestic product in the three months to June would still leave national output around 3% below its level before the recession began, making it comfortably the weakest recovery in living memory. That's hardly surprising given the witches' brew of falling real incomes, public sector job cuts, weak bank lending and the crisis in the eurozone, but it does raise the question of why the Q2 growth data is likely to be so strong. Three reasons spring to mind. Firstly, the economy is finally feeling the effects of four years of 0.5% interest rates and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. Secondly, consumer sentiment has subtly shifted in recent months, with people less fearful about losing their jobs or being unable to pay their mortgages. Thirdly, the chancellor has boosted the housing market with the Help to Buy scheme announced in the budget. Eyebrows have been raised at Osborne's decision to subsidise mortgages, since the taxpayer will pick up the tab if a traditional British property boom-bust results. This looks all too likely: demand for housing has picked up since Help to Buy was announced but there has been no accompanying spurt in the supply of homes. Property prices, far from cheap anyway, are starting to rise. The fact that the Bank of England has signalled its intention to keep monetary policy loose means they will rise further. The economics of this is questionable to say the least. Far from being the new model of growth based around manufacturing and exports promised by the coalition, this is the same model that generated the booms of 1973, 1988 and 2006: reliant on over-leveraged consumers taking on more debt to buy expensive real estate. On past form, there will be a sweet spot before it all ends in tears with a burgeoning trade deficit, rising inflationary pressure and a fall in house prices, only this time with the taxpayer bearing a share of the losses. Politically, though, it is a different story. Given the amount of spare capacity in the economy, the sweet spot may go on for some time and the early stages of a housing bubble will play well for the government. It will make owner occupiers feel wealthier. It will make life difficult for Labour. And it will allow ministers to say that all the sacrifices of the past three years have been worth it.",

A heatwave; a royal baby; sporting success; evidence that the economy has turned the corner: for Conservative strategists trying to generate a feelgood factor, it could hardly get better. This is 1982 redux; the moment when the clouds lift after a painful recession, with the government getting the political benefit from sticking to an unpopular but necessary strategy.</p> <p>Well, perhaps. Alternative historical reference points could be 1978 \u2013 the brief interlude between the sterling crisis of 1976 and the manufacturing meltdown of 1980-81, or 1972-3 when Ted Heath's government embarked on an ill-fated dash for growth after unemployment rose above one million for the first time since the second world war.</p> <p>The pickup in growth has been a long time in coming. Even a 1% increase in gross domestic product in the three months to June would still leave national output around 3% below its level before the recession began, making it comfortably the weakest recovery in living memory.</p> <p>That's hardly surprising given the witches' brew of falling real incomes, public sector job cuts, weak bank lending and the crisis in the eurozone, but it does raise the question of why the Q2 growth data is likely to be so strong. Three reasons spring to mind. Firstly, the economy is finally feeling the effects of four years of 0.5% interest rates and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing. Secondly, consumer sentiment has subtly shifted in recent months, with people less fearful about losing their jobs or being unable to pay their mortgages. Thirdly, the chancellor has boosted the housing market with the Help to Buy scheme announced in the budget.</p> <p>Eyebrows have been raised at Osborne's decision to subsidise mortgages, since the taxpayer will pick up the tab if a traditional British property boom-bust results. This looks all too likely: demand for housing has picked up since Help to Buy was announced but there has been no accompanying spurt in the supply of homes. Property prices, far from cheap anyway, are starting to rise. The fact that the Bank of England has signalled its intention to keep monetary policy loose means they will rise further.</p> <p>The economics of this is questionable to say the least. Far from being the new model of growth based around manufacturing and exports promised by the coalition, this is the same model that generated the booms of 1973, 1988 and 2006: reliant on over-leveraged consumers taking on more debt to buy expensive real estate. On past form, there will be a sweet spot before it all ends in tears with a burgeoning trade deficit, rising inflationary pressure and a fall in house prices, only this time with the taxpayer bearing a share of the losses.</p> <p>Politically, though, it is a different story. Given the amount of spare capacity in the economy, the sweet spot may go on for some time and the early stages of a housing bubble will play well for the government. It will make owner occupiers feel wealthier. It will make life difficult for Labour. And it will allow ministers to say that all the sacrifices of the past three years have been worth it.</p>",

Subsidies will force up house prices and make it harder for the next generation of first-time buyers to enter the market. It's a policy that will drive young people towards \"indentured servitude\", as Albert Edwards, a strategist at Societe Generale, put it. We'll avoid that well-trodden turf for the time being because there is specific irritation with the government's presentation of Help to Buy, stage two, the part where the state guarantees up to 14.25% of a high loan-to-value mortgage in exchange for a fee. It is the Treasury's failure, so far, to state what that fee will be. George Osborne, the chancellor, was at it again on Tuesday, declaring: \"As of today lenders have the detail they need to go away and get ready for next January's launch.\" No, chancellor, the lenders don't have all the details because they don't know the price of the state-backed insurance you are offering. You have merely set out rules you think will prevent high loan-to-value mortgages falling into the hands of those who cannot afford to repay. But, actually, it's the taxpayer who should be making a fuss. The chancellor has said the scheme will be self-funding in the sense that the banks and building societies will be charged a commercial rate to cover losses that will occur when borrowers default on guaranteed mortgages. But the tension there is obvious. If the fees are set high, the banks won't play. If they are set low, substantial risks will remain with the taxpayer. The part that should make taxpayers extremely suspicious is that one bank, Lloyds, is cheering even before the price of the insurance is set. \"From all the information we've got at the moment, we are definitely in the camp where we will join the scheme,\" it says. Have the banks got the nod that will the fees will be set low and thus they'll get (another) bargain from taxpayers?",

It consults with the Troika, the lenders, and will speak out when the consultation is completed. We must not run ahead. The course we traverse is long but we insist on our basic positions. On our part, we are diligent with regard to the implementation of the Memorandum and we think that only through its implementation we can get out of the Memorandum at the earliest.</p> <p>The consultation with the Troika takes place on a daily basis, it takes place in a very good climate, the road is difficult, but we are waiting for the final evaluation to say what we have to say on our part, and this will in fact be stated by the President of the Republic himself.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also emerged this afternoon that the Bank of Cyprus is considering splitting itself in two. Asked about this, Stylianides said its new shareholders must decide the future of the bank, which has already cut many hundreds of jobs and seen large depositors 'bailed in' to its rescue package.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/pio/pio.nsf/All/D6D0AB5D131B02C3C2257BB1004CC50C?OpenDocument&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">Stylianides's full statement is online here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51ee95f2e4b0f601adcf2f00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-23T14:40:50.712Z\">3.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While eurozone consumer confidence offered reasons for optimism, the latest US economic data disappointed.</p> <p>The Richmond Federal Reserve's survey of manufacturing output dropped to -11 in July, sharply lower than June's +8.

It's the best performance since August 2011.</p> <p>In the European Union, consumer confidence rose to -14.8, from -17.5 in June.</p> <p>Both readings still show that morale is weak, as you'd expect given the events of recent years \u2013 and the challenges ahead. The long-term average is zero (as the graph above shows).</p> <p><strong>Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the data was encouraging. </strong>Here's his early analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Eurozone consumer confidence extended its recent improvement in July to be at a 23-month high, likely driven by increased optimism about the economic outlook and a slightly less pessimistic view of the recent economic situation. Consumers were also likely relatively sanguine about the inflation situation and outlook.</p> <p>Hopefully, improving consumer confidence and the help to purchasing power coming from muted inflation across the Eurozone (just 1.6% in June) will provide increasing support to consumer spending and help Eurozone economic activity to stabilize and then finally start growing over the latter months of 2013.</p> <p>Even so, a marked overall pick up in Eurozone consumer spending still looks unlikely in the near term at least. Despite being at a 23-month high in July, confidence is still limited compared to long-term norms while Eurozone consumers continue to largely face high and rising unemployment, generally muted wage growth and tight fiscal policy. This is particularly, the case in the southern periphery countries but it is also true for countries such as France and the Netherlands.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-23T14:50:57.354Z\">at 3.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51ee8a1ae4b0abd43a029681\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-23T13:50:18.493Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Wall Street has opened higher, pushing the Dow Jones industrlal average to a new record intraday high.</p> <p>The Dow hit 15604 at the start of trading, up 59 points or 0.37%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.2% to 1,699.94.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC/statuses/359667885955747841\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The Dow and S&amp;P 500 touch all-time highs: <a href=\"http://t.co/8GIkHjpmn8\">http://t.co/8GIkHjpmn8</a></p>&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC/statuses/359667885955747841\">July 23, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-07-23T13:55:51.693Z\">at 2.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51ee8555e4b0b1165577557c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-07-23T13:29:57.493Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cypriot property prices have taken quite a hoofing since the country lurched into a rescue package in March, a new survey has found.</p> <p>The Cyprus arm of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) calculates that apartment price fell by 12.6% in the last three months.

      "bodyText": "After a bright start fuelled partly by positive comments about Chinese growth, markets have slipped back from their best levels on disappointment with the latest US manufacturing survey, writes Nick Fletcher. \u2022 The FTSE 100 fell 25.73 points or 0.39% to 6597.44 \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.2% at 8314 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.43% lower at 3923 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB edged up 0.03% to 16,238 \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 1.35% to 8073 \u2022 Athen's market ended up 0.02% at 842 Meanwhile in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 20 points ore 0.13%. And on that note, it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we're back tomorrow. Payment of the latest tranche of aid to Greece has reportedly been delayed, according to the German finance ministry: Over in Cyprus, a government spokesman has told reporters that talks with its Troika of lenders are continuing, with a \"difficult\" path ahead. It's nearly a week since officials from the Troika began their assessment of Cyprus's bailout programme. Asked about reports that there are concerns about progress regarding certain structural reforms, Christos Stylianides said: The Government is patient. It consults with the Troika, the lenders, and will speak out when the consultation is completed. We must not run ahead. The course we traverse is long but we insist on our basic positions. On our part, we are diligent with regard to the implementation of the Memorandum and we think that only through its implementation we can get out of the Memorandum at the earliest. The consultation with the Troika takes place on a daily basis, it takes place in a very good climate, the road is difficult, but we are waiting for the final evaluation to say what we have to say on our part, and this will in fact be stated by the President of the Republic himself. It also emerged this afternoon that the Bank of Cyprus is considering splitting itself in two. Asked about this, Stylianides said its new shareholders must decide the future of the bank, which has already cut many hundreds of jobs and seen large depositors 'bailed in' to its rescue package. Stylianides's full statement is online here. While eurozone consumer confidence offered reasons for optimism, the latest US economic data disappointed. The Richmond Federal Reserve's survey of manufacturing output dropped to -11 in July, sharply lower than June's +8. Particularly alarmingly, the retail sales measure tumbled by 23 points, to -22. Business Insider has a good summary: Richmond Fed Index Shows Mammoth Fall In Retail Sales Morale among consumers in the 17 countries which use the euro has improved, in another signal that conditions may be picking up. Data released by the European Commission found that eurozone consumer confidence improved to -17.4 this month, better than June's -18.8. It's the best performance since August 2011. In the European Union, consumer confidence rose to -14.8, from -17.5 in June. Both readings still show that morale is weak, as you'd expect given the events of recent years \u2013 and the challenges ahead. The long-term average is zero (as the graph above shows). Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said the data was encouraging. Here's his early analysis: Eurozone consumer confidence extended its recent improvement in July to be at a 23-month high, likely driven by increased optimism about the economic outlook and a slightly less pessimistic view of the recent economic situation. Consumers were also likely relatively sanguine about the inflation situation and outlook. Hopefully, improving consumer confidence and the help to purchasing power coming from muted inflation across the Eurozone (just 1.6% in June) will provide increasing support to consumer spending and help Eurozone economic activity to stabilize and then finally start growing over the latter months of 2013. Even so, a marked overall pick up in Eurozone consumer spending still looks unlikely in the near term at least. Despite being at a 23-month high in July, confidence is still limited compared to long-term norms while Eurozone consumers continue to largely face high and rising unemployment, generally muted wage growth and tight fiscal policy. This is particularly, the case in the southern periphery countries but it is also true for countries such as France and the Netherlands. Wall Street has opened higher, pushing the Dow Jones industrlal average to a new record intraday high. The Dow hit 15604 at the start of trading, up 59 points or 0.37%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.2% to 1,699.94. Cypriot property prices have taken quite a hoofing since the country lurched into a rescue package in March, a new survey has found. The Cyprus arm of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) calculates that apartment price fell by 12.6% in the last three months. Office space has tumbled by 23.3% during the quarter. And with capital controls still in place, the only way is down, as Pavlos Loizou of RICS Cyprus explained: Definitely the market is going to deteriorate further and faster than before. There is no lending available and people's money (in banks) is blocked. This follows many years of steadily rising prices during the good days, which now look firmly behind Cyprus. More on Reuters: Acute property slump takes hold in bailed-out Cyprus: survey European stock markets continue to be boosted by the encouraging news from Asia overnight. China's determination to keep GDP growth at 7% or higher, and Japan's upgraded economic forecasts (see 8.15am) has pushed mining stocks up in London - they're packing the list of top risers on the FTSE 100: And the Spanish stock market is romping ahead, after the Bank of Spain predicted that GDP fell by just 0.1% in the last three months (see 9.44am). Spain also conducted a successful debt auction this morning, with borrowing costs. That's sent the Spanish IBEX up 1.8%, followed by Italy's FTSE MIB which is up 1.2%. The FTSE 100 (+0.2%) German DAX (+0.26%) and French CAC (+0.2%) are only posting meagre gains, after Asian markets pushed to six-week highs overnight. Chris Beauchamp of IG says the City is calm and subdued: With the eurozone mercifully quiet for now, the main driver remains corporate earnings. London-listed miners are stretching their legs this morning after some suitably sunny comments from the Chinese premier. Beijing aims to keep growth above 7%; commendable as this is, saying something doesn\u2019t make it true, even if the latest economic data indicated that consumer spending in China was helping to pick up the slack. Developments in Turkey, where the Central Bank has just hiked its overnight lending rate to 7.25%, from 6.5%. It's the latest shot in its fight to stop the lira's value sliding -- it's been under pressure since last month's protests in Instanbul. The Bank of TurKey also warned that capital inflows are slowing, which it blamed on uncertainties within the global economy. The instant reaction \u2013 the lira has risen against the US dollar to a one-month high of $1.9090. Turkish government bonds also strengthened, pushing down the yields on 10-year debt to 8.49%, from 8.69% before. Here's a headline that reeks of Dickensian London: Rise in debtors adds to prison overcrowding But it's not Victorian history. It's Cyprus today, where the financial crisis is driving more people into jail through non-payment of fines and \"other debts\". Prison Governor Giorgos Tryfonides told the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) that efforts were being made to help such convicts pay off their debts in instalments. \u201cWe are trying our best to make plans for payment of debt so an arrangement can be made with the attorney-general to postpone any punishment as long as the instalment is accepted by the plaintiff,\u201d he said. Due to the crisis, the number of people facing jail for financial reasons is on the rise compared to other years, Tryfonides said, adding on certain days up to five people might be imprisoned for similar offences. Here's the full story: Rise in debtors adds to prison overcrowding. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras has now met with senior ministers to discuss meeting the country's bailout targets. Kathimerini reports that Samaras ordered his colleagues to speed up the pace of reforms, ahead of the Troika's next visit in early September. It explains: Prime Minister Antonis Samaras on Tuesday told key cabinet members in the two-party coalition to speed up structural reforms in the state sector in order to meet the targets set by the country's international creditors, who want to see progress in agreed changes to the public administration as a condition for releasing further life-saving funding. Meeting at his Maximos Mansion headquarters, Samaras, his coalition partner and Deputy Prime Minister Evangelos Venizelos, and Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras, called for more urgency from the ministers of Interior Yiannis Michelakis, Administrative Reform Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Education Constantinos Arvanitopoulos, Development Costis Hadzidakis and Health Adonis Georgiadis.

Ireland's central statistics office reported that property prices rose by 1.2% in June, on a year-on-year basis. That's the first rise since January 2008. Estate agents, though, report an uneven recovery - with prices up around 15% in Dublin in the last year. Europe 1 has uploaded a video clip of Pierre Moscovici's interview this morning, in which the French finance minister predicts that France's recession is over. Here's their story: Moscovici : \"nous sommes en sortie de r\u00e9cession\" Back in the UK...there'll be a few celebrations in Cheshire today. The Volkswagen Group has just announced that its first Bentley sports utility vehicle will be constructed at its headquarters in Crewe, creating up to 1,000 new jobs across the country. Bentley will invest some \u00a3800m at the site, VW added. A nice fillip for the British economy, ahead of Thursday's GDP figures which are likely to show that growth picked up in the last three months. A date for the diary - Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, will answer questions regarding the illegal payments scandal in parliament on August 1. More details here. Yesterday, Rajoy bowed to pressure and announced that he would agree to be quizzed over the affair, centred on a former treasurer of his party accused of siphoning off millions of euros of secret cash payments. Spain's latest GDP forecasts (see 9.44am) bolster hopes that the eurozone will keep muddling through the crisis, argues Simon Nixon of the Wall Street Journal: In the UK, the British Bankers Association has reported that mortgage approvals rose to a 17-month high of 37,278 in June, up from 36,290 in May. Quite an improvement on February's 31,109 \u2013 the month before UK chancellor George Osborne announced new measures to stimulate the housing market. Osborne's been meeting with the industry this morning to discuss his Help to Buy Scheme -- which critics claim will fuel a new price bubble. But as my colleague Rupert Jones reports, planned income checks and \"stress testing\" means many people with less-than-perfect credit records could be barred from the \u00a312bn scheme. Credit history will bar many from \u00a312bn scheme for homebuyers Spain has now endured a recession for the last two years, but the pace of the downturn is finally slowing, according to official forecasts released this morning. The Bank of Spain predicts that GDP shrank by just 0.1% in the last three months. That would be a much smaller contraction than the 0.5% drop in output recorded in the first quarter of this year. On an annual basis, the Bank believes the Spanish economy had shrunk 1.8% over the last 12 months -- again, a small improvement on Q1's reading, of 2%. The Bank said that 'strong exports' had helped to moderate the pace of the downturn. We get official GDP data for April-June next month, which will show whether or not the Spanish recession has really lasted for eight quarters, having begun in the second half of 2011. The Madrid government has pinned its hopes on the recovering beginning in the current quarter. Analysts fear, thought, that the country's banks are too weak to support a bounce-back -- as their levels of toxic debts are still rising. There are also concerns that this year's tourist season could be weaker than hoped, as holidaymakers across Europe tighten their belts. Bloomberg has a report here: Spanish Sunshine Season Overshadowed by Growth Doubts It begins: In Almeria\u2019s Cabo de Gata natural park, one of the few unspoilt stretches left of Spain\u2019s southern coast, Hotel Tio Kiko is close to full. Its owner, Jose Venzal Alonso, isn\u2019t optimistic though. \u201cI can\u2019t say I see an economic recovery,\u201d the 51-year-old hotel manager says in a telephone interview, speaking with a heavy southern Spanish accent. \u201cAll our clients are saying so, that they can\u2019t afford to stay more than three days when they would happily come for six before the crisis. We used to have a full house much earlier in the season.\u201d France's finance minister has declared that the French recession is over, hot on the heels of this morning's upbeat industrial morale reading (9.07am). Speaking on Europe 1 radio, Pierre Moscovici cited forecasts from the Bank of France and INSEE for growth of 0.2% in the second quarter of this year. That would reverse the contraction of 0.2% in the first three months of 2013, which pushed France into Le Double DIp. Moscovici declared: Now we need to work to transform this exit from recession into a genuine recovery. (quotes via Reuters). France's economy has been stagnating over the last two year, as this graph shows: There's reasons for optimism in France too this morning, where optimism among industrial firms has risen to its highest level for over a year. Despite concerns over France's fiscal position, INSEE's monthly survey of industrial morale rose for the fourth month in a row, to 95. That's a rise on June's 93, and better than analysts expected. But it's still low in historical terms, where 100 is the long-term average. The broader measure of business confidence also rose, to 87, from 86. Again, better, but still weak, as these charts show: In Greece, meanwhile, the government is cracking on with the task of meeting the targets agreed with its lenders, including cutting thousands of public sector jobs. Prime minister Antonis Samaras has summoned his top ministers to a meeting on Greece's \"mobility scheme' \u2013 a key part of the strategy to lay off tens of thousands public sector workers. Deputy PM Evangelos Venizelos, finance minister Yannis Stournaras and administrative reform minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis are all attending. Kathimerini has more details: Samaras is likely to press ministers to speed up the evaluation of staff at their ministries to ensure the project remains on track. Mitsotakis, who has been tasked with overseeing the civil service overhaul, appealed to his colleagues to join the effort. \u201cI have repeatedly said that the job of administrative reform is being overseen by this ministry but, if we are to hit the targets, all the ministries must be involved.\u201d But the mobility scheme remains deeply unpopular with the workers who face being moved into it on lower pay, with the threat of being laid off. As reported in Monday's liveblog, schoolteachers held a protest rally in Athens yesterday...and medical staff are planning a strike tomorrow. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. We start with encouraging signs from Asia, where bullish talk from Chinese premier Li Keqiang and the Japanese government have sparked a share rally overnight. Li tried to calm fears that the Chinese economy was stalling, telling businessmen in Shanghai that the country\u2019s \u201cbottom line\u201d for economic growth is 7% in future (it slowed to 7.5% in the last quarter). The comments came amid local reports that Beijing will drive investments in high-speed railways to help reduce overcapacity in sectors such as cement and steel. Cue optimism across the region. As Alvin Pattisahusiwa, a director of investment at PT Manulife Aset Manajemen Indonesia, put it: Li\u2019s statement provides assurances for investors that there won\u2019t be negative surprises in the country. That's welcome news in Europe too, where there are fears that China could slide into an economic hole before the eurozone manages to dig itself out of its own predicament. And with Tokyo's Cabinet Office upgrading its economic outlook for the third month in a row, there's a little more optimism about prospects in the month ahead. The Cabinet Office declared that the Japanese economy was \"steadily picking up\", and moving towards a \"self-sustainable recovery\", adding: Recent price developments indicate that deflation is easing. This stream of news sparked a decent rally in Asia, driving markets to a six week high. China's CSI 300 jumped 2.5%, driven by railway company shares, while the Hong Kong Hang Seng is up 3.5%. And in Europe, traders are joining in - with the main indices all gaining ground (the FTSE 100's up 27 points at 6650.

While weak exports have dragged down growth in recent months, the domestic economy has proved a little more resilient, with unemployment hitting a three-year low of 13.6%. Most economists still expect the economy to record a third year of growth in 2013 and outperform most of its rivals on the eurozone periphery, according to a Reuters poll, and Ireland is widely expected to exit its EU-IMF bailout in December.",

    "webTitle": "Bentley to build SUV in Crewe", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bentley Motors is to build its first ever sports utility vehicle, creating 1,000 new jobs in the UK and driving \u00a3800m of investment at its Crewe plant. The luxury car manufacturer, owned by Germany's Volkswagen Group, said the 185mph 4x4 would go on sale from 2016. It is likely to be priced at the top end of the SUV market, with a retail value of around \u00a3150,000. David Cameron said the investment and job creation was good news both for the town and the UK as a whole. \"It is another important milestone in strengthening our economy. One sector that we know is sprinting ahead in the global race is our booming automotive industry,\" said the prime minister, speaking at Bentley's Crewe site on Tuesday. Cameron added that the investment would also increase training opportunities for skilled apprentices. Of the 1,000 jobs to be created, 400 will be directly employed by Bentley at Crewe, with the balance generated in the supply chain. The company employs 4,000 people at Crewe, where operations include design, research and development, engineering and production. Volkswagen's chairman, Martin Winterkorn, reiterated the group's commitment to manufacturing in the UK, describing it as \"a competitive location for industrial production\". The UK car industry has been held up by ministers as a poster child for manufacturing and exports, as the government seeks to rebalance the economy away from debt-fuelled spending and towards overseas trade. The luxury end of the market, represented in the UK by the likes of Mini and Jaguar Land Rover, has been more resilient while sales among the volume manufacturers have been hit hard by waning demand in Europe amid the financial crisis. Exports at Bentley totalled \u00a31bn in 2012, and four-out-of-five cars that it makes in the UK are sold overseas. The company said the new model would be the most luxurious and powerful SUV in the market, and that it had received a positive response from customers over the last 16 months. Bentley first showcased a concept SUV model at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, before taking it to overseas markets including the US, China and European countries to gain feedback.

One sector that we know is sprinting ahead in the global race is our booming automotive industry,\" said the prime minister, speaking at Bentley's Crewe site on Tuesday.</p> <p>Cameron added that the investment would also increase training opportunities for skilled apprentices. Of the 1,000 jobs to be created, 400 will be directly employed by Bentley at Crewe, with the balance generated in the supply chain. The company employs 4,000 people at Crewe, where operations include design, research and development, engineering and production.</p> <p>Volkswagen's chairman, Martin Winterkorn, reiterated the group's commitment to manufacturing in the UK, describing it as \"a competitive location for industrial production\".</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/automotive-industry\" title=\"\">UK car industry</a> has been held up by ministers as a poster child for manufacturing and exports, as the government seeks to rebalance the economy away from debt-fuelled spending and towards overseas trade. The luxury end of the market, represented in the UK by the likes of Mini and Jaguar Land Rover, has been more resilient while sales among the volume manufacturers have been hit hard by waning demand in Europe amid the financial crisis.</p> <p>Exports at Bentley totalled \u00a31bn in 2012, and four-out-of-five cars that it makes in the UK are sold overseas. The company said the new model would be the most luxurious and powerful SUV in the market, and that it had received a positive response from customers over the last 16 months.</p> <p>Bentley first showcased a concept SUV model at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, before taking it to overseas markets including the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa\" title=\"\">US</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china\" title=\"\">China</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/europe/roundup\" title=\"\">European</a> countries to gain feedback.

The FTSE 250 property company Shaftesbury said strong demand for all its commercial and residential space was pushing up rents and driving high occupancy levels. \"London continues to attract unprecedented levels of interest from across the world from businesses choosing to locate and invest here, from visitors seeking to experience its unrivalled variety of attractions and from those who live and work here,\" it said in a trading update for the period between 1 April and 23 July. The company owns more than 560 shops, restaurants, bars and cafes in the West End, including Carnaby Street and large parts of Covent Garden. It also owns 394,000 sq ft of offices and 452 apartments in the area, as well as other joint venture properties. Shaftesbury said it was difficult to find properties to buy because existing owners in the West End were unwilling to sell. Acquisitions in the year to date totalled \u00a322.9m. Total debt at 30 June was \u00a3583.2m, an increase of \u00a37.8m since 31 March. The company had commercial space available to let amounting to 3.8% of its wholly owned commercial portfolio, with an estimated rental value at 30 June of \u00a33.2m, of which \u00a32m was under offer. Shaftesbury said it had started redeveloping buildings in the Carnaby Street area in January, which would provide retail and office space as well as a new restaurant and 12 apartments.",
