      "bodyText": "The government has called for a comprehensive review of Britain\u2019s auditing industry in what could herald huge changes to a sector dominated by the firms known as the big four. Calls for reform have grown after the collapse of the construction giant Carillion and the former high street stalwart BHS revealed serious inadequacies in the auditing process. The business secretary, Greg Clark, said it was \u201cright to learn the lessons and apply them without delay\u201d as he ordered the inquiry into competition within the industry where Deloitte, PwC, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG audit 98% of the UK\u2019s largest listed companies. \u201cThe collapse of Carillion exposed deficiencies in an audit process, where the market is dominated by just four large firms,\u201d Clark said, in an interview with the Financial Times. He added: \u201cWe know competition is one of the key drivers for maintaining and improving standards, so I have asked the Competition and Markets Authority to consider looking again at what can be done to improve the audit sector.\u201d Thousands of jobs were lost following Carillion\u2019s collapse in January, with a subsequent parliamentary report finding that Deloitte \u2013 which received \u00a310m to be the outsourcing company\u2019s internal auditor \u2013 had been either \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to identify failings in financial controls, or \u201ctoo readily ignored them\u201d. Ernst &amp; Young was paid \u00a310.8m for \u201csix months of failed turnaround advice\u201d. Elsewhere, PwC was fined \u00a310m by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) for signing off on the accounts of BHS, before its sale for \u00a31. The retailer collapsed in 2016, prompting the loss of 11,000 jobs. Frank Field, the chairman of the work and pensions committee, said poor business practices were \u201cwaved through by a cosy club of auditors, conflicted at every turn\u201d. The FRC has previously called for an inquiry into whether the big four should be broken up, with their audit divisions spun off. This year, Deloitte warned that such a measure could affect the UK\u2019s standing as a global financial centre. Labour welcomed the announcement, but claimed the Conservatives were \u201cplaying catch-up\u201d. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cThe Tories are finally taking their lead from Labour on tackling the big four audit firms. Labour commissioned an independent review of the UK\u2019s corporate auditing and accounting regime earlier in the year, and now the business secretary is trying to play catch up. \u201cBut the government cannot use this review to sweep issues under the carpet. Failures of auditing and accounting on the Tories\u2019 watch led to the collapse of Carillion. \u201cThe next Labour government will change regulations to make sure scandals like Carillion never happen again.\u201d The review will be led by Andrew Tyrie, the head of the Competition and Markets Authority.\u201cThe CMA has been considering for some time how best to contribute to the work being carried out to improve audit,\u201d he said. A CMA spokesperson added: \u201cWe\u2019re actively considering what next steps are needed.\u201d Ernst and Young said: \u201cWe are aware of the comments made by Greg Clark and recognise the importance of the debate to ensure a strong profession. Our absolute priority is to serve and protect the public interest and bring confidence to the capital markets, and we welcome measures that would encourage new entrants into the audit market.\u201d Deloitte said: \u201cWe are supportive of measures to reform the audit market that respond to concerns raised on choice and perceived conflicts. At the same time we are focused on continuing to improve audit quality and any measures for reform must support the delivery of high quality audits. \u201cWe believe that concerns raised go to a deeper question as to the purpose of audit and its value to stakeholders. To address this a wider discussion is needed to consider what the role of audit can and should be in the future, especially as large companies continue to grow in scale, become increasingly technology driven and complex, and global in their outlook and requirements.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As Philip Hammond puts the finishing touches to his conference speech he may want to consider a total rewrite. Boring Phil needs to talk to the nation, not his party. It is time for the most senior one-nation Tory (Theresa May is a pretender to this crown) to be a bit more statesmanlike and think about people beyond the audience. That doesn\u2019t look likely though. His announcement last week of an autumn budget (on 29 October), suggested he plans to stick to offering a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d to debt \u201cwhile supporting vital public services, and building a stronger, more prosperous economy\u201d. He uses these phrases almost every time he emerges from the Treasury. And indications are that audiences at this week\u2019s Tory conference can expect more of the same, with extra Brexit spice and a twist of global uncertainty. That means he will tell the crowd inside Birmingham\u2019s conference centre that his balanced approach will be applied even more conservatively now it is clear the disastrous prospect of a no-deal Brexit could coincide with a trade tariff war. How, he will ask, can he spend more money when he may need to draw on every bit of our reserves in just six months? It would be irresponsible to spend now, when Britain and the world economy are entering an uncertain phase. That\u2019s just a fraud. The government is pursuing anything but a balanced approach. Things are already falling apart and the next four years will be even rougher than the past eight as he puts deficit reduction ahead of protecting public services and supporting vulnerable families. As for building a stronger economy, Hammond has set aside some money for transport infrastructure, but precious little Treasury cash for anything new or innovative. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has produced a string of disturbing reports showing that a slowdown in GDP growth since 2016 \u2013 most of which can be attributed to the referendum vote \u2013 will leave workers facing an unprecedented second decade of weak earnings growth and more years of austerity. At the last budget, when the Office for Budget Responsibility said it had lost faith in Britain\u2019s ability to generate strong productivity growth, and with it inflation-busting wage rises, the IFS warned that average earnings were on course to be \u00a31,400 a year lower in 2021 than had been forecast in 2016. In addition, borrowing was likely to be \u00a312bn higher in 2021 than previously predicted. If you thought a cold wind blew through public services between 2008 and 2018, prepare for a permanent winter for the next 10 years. With 50% of families that live in poverty found to have a disabled adult or disabled child in their household, Britons should see that the common weal, the promise to look after those who find themselves struggling financially through no fault of their own, is broken. Today the Observer reveals that the cost of lost growth, mediocre wage rises and lower tax receipts since the referendum vote is \u00a326bn and counting, much worse than previously estimated. Hammond knows that the fabric of public services is fraying and people are not receiving even a basic level of support they deserve. Schools are the latest to shred their budgets to retain staff; most other public service providers have already cut themselves to the bone. Hammond is an honourable, one-nation Tory who stood with May when she said that just-about-managing families deserved more support. He wants to help, say his Treasury colleagues. It\u2019s just that the loss of economic activity already incurred and the losses to come have boxed him in and mean he must keep his financial powder dry. He would, they say, raise taxes on us all to fund better public services. He\u2019d even tax the rich more than the poor, but his own party, Jacob Rees-Mogg in particular, won\u2019t wear it. Inaction, though, would be the coward\u2019s way out. It would be much more statesmanlike to ditch his fiscal rules and maintain a 2% budget deficit. With the OECD expecting nominal GDP growth to fall from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.2% in 2019, the overall debt-to-GDP ratio will fall. It\u2019s just that the annual deficit won\u2019t reach zero by the middle of the next decade, as he has promised. The Resolution Foundation calculates that on current projections, he could free up \u00a377bn by 2022 to spend on welfare and services. It might disappoint the IMF, which has decided to repeat the same mistakes that it made after the financial crash by insisting on manic deficit-reduction-linked austerity, but on this subject it is discredited. Hammond, for the sake of our democracy, must argue the case for a more caring government, Brexit or no Brexit.",

    "webTitle": "Can Labour\u2019s five-point plan rescue Britain\u2019s high streets?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The high street is facing its darkest hour, with tens of thousands of jobs disappearing as traditional retailers are crushed by the rise of internet shopping and restaurants are hit by tough competition and home delivery services. Successive governments have commissioned reviews, most famously by Mary \u201cQueen of Shops\u201d Portas, to diagnose the problem and come up with a solution but little has happened despite evidence of an escalating crisis. This year alone House of Fraser, Maplin and Toys R Us have gone bust while household names like Marks &amp; Spencer, Carpetright and Mothercare have together announced hundreds of store closures. Labour\u2019s rising star Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, used last week\u2019s party conference to announce an \u201cemergency five-point plan\u201d to save Britain\u2019s high streets. So does Labour have the answers to the high street SOS? Ban ATM charges and stop bank branch and post office closures With 60 bank branches and 250 free cash machines closing every month, access to cash, particularly in rural areas, is getting harder. The trend has been fuelled by the dramatic increase in contactless payments and the growth of online banking. Although the number of post offices has halved to 11,547 since the early 80s the Post Office says numbers have stabilised, with the network turning a profit. The loss of banking services has had an impact on shop owners, who found takings down by an average of 20% after their local bank branch shut and had a knock-on effect on footfall, according to a recent poll by Nottingham Building Society. \u201cI don\u2019t think it can be stopped,\u201d is the gloomy assessment of Derek French, a former director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, who spent 16 years fighting against bank branch closures. \u201cThe decision to close [a branch] is a commercial one taken by the bank and that\u2019s been approved by both Labour and Conservative governments. It\u2019s very difficult to alter that. It would be lovely, but when you start examining the data, which I spent more than a decade doing, it ain\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d Provide free bus travel for under-25s Local bus services have been among the casualties of austerity. The Local Government Association told a parliamentary inquiry into the future role of high streets that outside of London, 117m bus miles \u2013 nearly half of all council-subsidised services \u2013 have been lost since 2011. Labour says it will fund bus travel for up to 13 million young people at a cost of \u00a31.4bn per year, based on bus use statistics from the National Travel Survey. Nearly a third of shoppers rely on buses because they don\u2019t have a car, so savage cuts to services could help explain the sharp declines in visitors that some high streets \u2013 footfall has declined by nearly a fifth over the last decade \u2013 have experienced. Research for Greener Journeys \u2013 a national campaign to promote environmentally friendly travel \u2013 found that every \u00a31 spent on concessionary travel for apprentices delivered \u00a32.70 in wider economic benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s great that Labour recognises the importance of bus travel, especially for young people, and the important role that buses play in providing access to high streets and boosting local economies,\u201d says Claire Haigh, chief executive of Greener Journeys. \u201cGovernments have continually prioritised car travel over public transport.\u201d Free public wifi in town centres In June Sheffield joined other cities, including Newcastle and Plymouth, offering free wifi as part of a push to encourage visitors and residents to spend more time and money in their centres. The need for \u201cnetworked\u201d high streets was one of the recommendations of the influential 2013 Grimsey review led by the former Wickes and Iceland chief executive Bill Grimsey. These services can be low cost because councils can trade access to street furniture needed to set up a commercial network, such as street lamps, in exchange for offering a free service to consumers. But the world has moved on \u2013 indeed an update of the Grimsey review was published this year. Matthew Hopkinson, a property analyst who co-authored both Grimsey reports, says five years on Britons now enjoy generous data packages on their mobiles so pushing for free wifi is a \u201cbit of a waste of time\u201d. \u201cAlso what personal data do I have to share to get it?\u201d he adds. \u201cThe biggest issue facing town centres is enabling and supporting local authorities and other stakeholders to recognise the changes taking place and to plan a future beyond retail for their communities.\u201d Establish a register of landlords of empty shops in each local authority There are 50,000 empty shops in the UK, according to Hopkinson, but that figure is predicted to double within a decade as the shift online sees household names such as Marks &amp; Spencer retreat from ailing high streets. Labour says an empty shops register would end difficulties in contacting the owner of an empty shop and make it easier to bring them back into use. \u201cI think this comes from the old-school perception that landlords are holding properties vacant for some reason,\u201d says Dan Simms of the property advisory firm Colliers International, who said the plan was \u201ctinkering around the edges\u201d. \u201cThe fundamental problem is that people are not spending their money in physical stores, they are choosing to spend it online. Our biggest problem is not finding shops to open, it\u2019s finding people to open shops.\u201d Review business rates to bring them into the 21st century The scourge of business rates has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre following last year\u2019s revaluation, which hit retailers in parts of the country where there have been property booms (rates are calculated as a proportion of a property\u2019s value). Long-Bailey\u2019s promise to overhaul the \u201cbroken\u201d business rates system is a crowd-pleaser but the property tax raises about \u00a330bn \u2013 \u00a38bn from retailers \u2013 a year with the take helping underpin the finances of cash-strapped councils. The revaluation added to the retail sector\u2019s business rates burden, increasing it by \u00a3226m this year. \u201cBringing forward the revaluation cycle from a triennial basis is a step too far and an unrealistic ask of the Valuation Office Agency,\u201d said Robert Hayton, head of UK business rates at the consultancy Altus Group, who says the gargantuan task of assessing nearly 2m properties costs \u00a350m. \u201cIt would bring with it a huge cost burden likely to be borne by ratepayers\u201d. The government studied the business rates regime as recently as 2015 and Hayton says the difficult questions have already been asked. \u201cRather than promises of rates reviews from politicians \u2026what we really need is a proper taxation strategy for the digital economy, which levels the playing field and supports our high streets,\u201d he says. There is no shortage of brainpower being expended on the issue, with a parliamentary inquiry into the future role of high streets currently competing with a review led by the shoe repair tycoon Sir John Timpson, at the behest of the minister for local growth, Jake Berry. But Grimsey warned MPs on the housing, communities and local government committee that time was of the essence as the high street \u201ctipping point has arrived\u201d. \u201cI spent my entire career in the 20th century, along with my fellow retailers, creating clone towns up and down the UK,\u201d he said, making the case for putting strong local leadership at the heart of any retail plan. \u201cIt is quite clear that in the 21st century that is going to be unpicked. \u201cThere is no silver bullet. There are some guidelines, but the solutions are local. My appeal to you is that if anything comes out of this, it is a recommendation that we get on with it.\u201d What retailers want \u2022 A level playing field on tax Amazon\u2019s tax bill is low because it sells from warehouses rather than high street stores. Retail chiefs want government to find a fairer way to tax the digital high street. \u2022 Reform of business rates The British Retail Consortium is calling for rates to be frozen until the 2021 revaluation and an overhaul of the system. \u2022 Lower rents Buoyant retailer Next has asked for a clause in new leases so its rents falls back in line with those of neighbours that are using insolvency procedures. \u2022 Accessible high streets Expensive and inadequate parking is a major bugbear. \u2022 Fewer stores Upkeep of ageing high street stores is a big cost for retailers, who prefer shiny, purpose-built shopping centres and retail parks with parking directly outside.",

Although the number of post offices has halved to 11,547 since the early 80s the Post Office says numbers have stabilised, with the network turning a profit.

A couple of miles from Manchester city centre, a concrete high-rise looms over what is known locally as the \u201cprecinct\u201d. A daubed red arrow points to \u201cSalford Shopping City\u201d, a 1960s-built complex that is home to a particularly depressing collection of charity shops, pawnshops and payday lenders. Before it was built, ambitious city planners suggested this could be the finest shopping precinct in Europe. But over the past decade, the weekly market has disappeared and many big-name shops have pulled out \u2013 some replaced with discount stores, others not replaced at all. A handful of permanent market stalls are still trading, but some stallholders say they are on borrowed time. Mal Hotra was just nine when he started helping his Italian mother and Punjabi father on their market stall. Fifty years on he is still here, but it has taken a good deal of grit and determination to keep his clothing business, Mal\u2019s Schoolwear, afloat. The 59-year-old father to four girls is one of a smattering of independent shops that have managed to stave off closure. High rents, a reduction in footfall and stiff competition have forced many others out. For Hotra and other stallholders, the slow decline began about 18 years ago when Marks &amp; Spencer closed its store. WH Smith followed suit, as did the electrical retailer Currys. Then came the killer blow: \u201cWoolies went bust and even some of the discount shops started to disappear.\u201d Hotra says: \u201cWe can\u2019t compete with the internet and bigger stores. They don\u2019t have the same overheads as us, but if the rents were reduced, that might change.\u201d Eileen Pickard has been shopping at the precinct for two decades but says the change in recent years has been stark. \u201cYou could come here at the weekend and get everything from the market \u2013 fruit and veg, fish, meat, even clothes. The place was buzzing. But then M&amp;S went and others left too. Once these shops go, they never come back.\u201d But James Morrissey has a more sunny outlook. Also a regular precinct shopper, he thinks the discount stores and charity shops serve the locals well. \u201cI am Salford born and bred and I don\u2019t think you get M&amp;S types round here,\u201d he says.",

Fifty years on he is still here, but it has taken a good deal of grit and determination to keep his clothing business, Mal\u2019s Schoolwear, afloat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b769d1865bf1a8917fda99a60d2976af1170704\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b769d1865bf1a8917fda99a60d2976af1170704/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mal Hotra at his school uniform stall in the \u2018precinct\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mal Hotra at his school uniform stall in the \u2018precinct\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Waugh for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 59-year-old father to four girls is one of a smattering of independent shops that have managed to stave off closure. High rents, a reduction in footfall and stiff competition have forced many others out.</p> <p>For Hotra and other stallholders, the slow decline began about 18 years ago when Marks &amp; Spencer closed its store. WH Smith followed suit, as did the electrical retailer Currys. Then came the killer blow: \u201cWoolies went bust and even some of the discount shops started to disappear.\u201d</p> <p>Hotra says: \u201cWe can\u2019t compete with the internet and bigger stores. They don\u2019t have the same overheads as us, but if the rents were reduced, that might change.\u201d </p> <p>Eileen Pickard has been shopping at the precinct for two decades but says the change in recent years has been stark. \u201cYou could come here at the weekend and get everything from the market \u2013 fruit and veg, fish, meat, even clothes. The place was buzzing. But then M&amp;S went and others left too. Once these shops go, they never come back.\u201d</p> <p>But James Morrissey has a more sunny outlook. Also a regular precinct shopper, he thinks the discount stores and charity shops serve the locals well. \u201cI am Salford born and bred and I don\u2019t think you get M&amp;S types round here,\u201d he says.</p>",
