      "bodyText": "Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti, has warned of the apocalyptic consequences of failure at next week's summit of EU leaders, outlining a potential death spiral that could threaten the political and economic future of Europe. The Italian leader is to hold talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, in the hope that the single currency's big four countries can pave the way for a breakthrough at next week's meeting. Speaking to the Guardian and a group of leading European newspapers, Monti said that, without a successful outcome at the summit, \"there would be progressively greater speculative attacks on individual countries, with harassment of the weaker countries\". The attacks would be focused not only on those who had failed to respect EU guidelines, but also on those like Italy, which he said had abided by the rules \"but which carry with them from the past a high debt\". Monti warned: \"A large part of Europe would find itself having to continue to put up with very high interest rates that would then impact on the states and also indirectly on firms. This is the direct opposite of what is needed for economic growth.\" Outlining the result of a failure at the talks, Monti said that, faced with creeping economic paralysis, \"the frustration of the public towards Europe would grow\", creating a vicious circle. \"To emerge in good shape from this crisis of the eurozone and the European economy, ever more integration is needed,\" said Monti. Yet, if the summit failed to resolve the problems quickly, \"public opinion, but also that of the governments and parliament\u2026 will turn against that greater integration\". Monti said he could see the beginnings of the process \"even in the Italian parliament, which has traditionally been pro-European and no longer is\". He made his remarks hours after his predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi, acknowledged that his party had bled support because of its backing for the Monti government's unpopular budgetary measures and spoke openly for the first time of the electoral advantage it could derive from torpedoing Monti's non-party cabinet of technocrats. Monti signalled that the key eurozone leaders were working on a plan designed to halt the spread of debt contagion while satisfying Germany's refusal to sanction financial irresponsibility. The plan, he said, was one of the \"absolutely necessary\" outcomes of next week's summit. The first outcome, he said, would be a clear sign of the eurozone's willingness to integrate further \"in such a way that Europeans know where they're going\u2026 [and] the markets are convinced that, having given birth to the euro, the will [of the member states] to make it indissoluble and irrevocable is there and will be strengthened by other steps towards integration\". He warned: \"There may not be \u2013 indeed, there will not be \u2013 a fully-fledged, detailed blueprint, but there will some strong elements and a short road \u2013 I hope short, a few months \u2013 to get from there to the overall project.\" Other minimum requirements were \"a fuller banking union, with advances in terms of integrated, and if possible unified, supervision\"; \"a European deposit guarantee\" system; and the plan that will be on the table on Friday for \"new market-friendly policy mechanisms\" to help out countries under attack \u2013 provided they had complied with EU demands for fiscal discipline. On Thursday figures indicating that the eurozone is slipping into recession heightened fears that Italy will follow Spain in asking Brussels for rescue funds. Only a strong performance from Germany stopped the currency union from contracting in the first quarter. But separate data showed the German private sector suffered a severe downturn in May, made worse by a slump in manufacturing. The German services sector continued to expand, but this solitary piece of good news is unlikely to keep the eurozone from recession in the second quarter, especially after both manufacturing and services contracted in France. Elsewhere, the US suffered a slowdown in growth across the manufacturing sector and China registered its eighth consecutive contraction in production. Without recourse to strongly growing export markets, Italy can expect to see its growth hit for another year, analysts said. Monti said the proposed new mechanism would kick in \"when there is a recognition by the European authorities of respect for the rules on public finance and structural reforms\". Making intervention conditional on good behaviour could offer a way of providing relief for countries like Italy and Spain, while meeting German demands for fiscal discipline. Monti avoided giving details but said he was \"very favourable\" to the purchase of the bonds of countries under attack. The present system, of assistance to the banking sector by way of the state, led to an increase in public debt that raised the yields \u2013 and cut the value \u2013 of government bonds, which in turn weakened the finances of the banks, creating \"a disagreeable spiral\u2026 That is why measures to de-couple this are being studied\", he said.",

Massa said: \"Poor countries are vulnerable to the euro crisis not only because of their exposure (due to dependence on trade flows, remittances, private capital flows and aid) but also because of their weaker resilience compared to 2007, before the onset of the global financial crisis. \"The ability of developing countries to respond to the shock waves emanating from the euro area crisis is likely to be constrained if international finance dries up and global conditions deteriorate sharply.\" In order to weather the crisis, the ODI advised developing countries should continue to focus on the goals of solid public finances and economic stability as long-term goals, but should also \"spur aggregate domestic demand, promote export diversification in both markets and products, improve financial regulation, endorse long-term growth policies, and strengthen social safety nets. \"For their part, multilateral institutions should ensure that adequate funds and shock facilities are put in place in a coordinated way to provide effective and timely assistance to crisis-affected countries.\" The ODI report said that the ability of developing countries to respond to the shock waves emanating from the euro area crisis was likely to be constrained if flows of international finance dried up and if the global economy took another turn for the worse. \"The escalation of the euro crisis and the fact that growth rates in emerging BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) economies, which have been the engine of the global recovery after the 2008\u20139 financial crisis, are now slowing down make the current situation really worrying for developing countries.\"",

      "bodyText": "A high court judge has accused bankers of forcing the collapse of the Farepak Christmas savings club by sucking it dry of millions of pounds of savers' hard-earned cash. The court heard that HBOS forced Farepak's directors to continue collecting savers' deposits \u2013 cash which the bankers derided as \"Doris money\" \u2013 when it was clear that the savings club was going to go bust. \"HBOS knew that those deposits would be paid \u2026 and that the only beneficiary of those deposits would be HBOS,\" said Mr Justice Peter Smith. The judge said that HBOS, which is now part of the bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group, did not break the law by taking \u00a34m of savers' deposits when it was clear that Farepak was on the brink of collapse. But he added that the bank's behaviour \"might not be regarded in the public's eyes as being acceptable\". In an extraordinarily impassioned speech delivered in open court after the collapse of a case against Farepak's former directors, Smith said he was not presiding over a \"court of morality\", but suggested HBOS should make amends to Farepak's savers by donating millions more to a distress fund. The judge said Fraser Kelly, HBOS's head of corporate banking, had taken \"almost a pride\" in his \"hardball\" approach to getting the bank's money back from Farepak, part of a larger firm called European Home Retail, which also went bust. Farepak's 116,400 savers, most of whom were low-income families, had no inkling that anything was amiss and continued to pay in \u00a31m a week right up to the company's collapse in October 2006. The savers eventually collected just 15p for every \u00a31 they saved for Christmas, while HBOS's \u00a331m loan was repaid in full. The judge said HBOS could have saved Farepak from collapse if it had pumped in just \u00a33m-5m more cash. \"The unchanging attitude of the bank not to give anything during this period was the reason why the companies failed,\" he said. Celebrities and supermarkets rallied round to help save the Farepak victims' Christmases. HBOS donated \u00a32m to the fund in November 2006.

Cable's attempt to bar the bosses of Farepak from the corporate world for up to 15 years collapsed on Wednesday when the Insolvency Service, which brought the case on Cable's behalf, was forced to abandon the case owing to a series of errors. The judge said witnesses were forced to retract key evidence when it became clear they did not understand, and in some cases had not even read, their witness statements. Judge Smith also criticised the Insolvency Service's lawyers for introducing witness statements that ran to 700 pages or, as the Judge said, \"the size of a novella\".

In this earlier essay, however, Keynes distinguished between unemployment caused by temporary economic breakdowns and what he called \"technological unemployment\" \u2013 that is, \"unemployment due to the discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour\".</p> <p>Keynes reckoned that we would hear much more about this kind of unemployment in the future. But its emergence, he thought, was a cause for hope, rather than despair. For it showed that the developed world, at least, was on track to solving the \"economic problem\" \u2013 the problem of scarcity that kept mankind tethered to a burdensome life of toil.</p> <p>Machines were rapidly replacing human labour, holding out the prospect of vastly increased production at a fraction of the existing human effort. In fact, Keynes thought that by about now (the early 21st century) most people would have to work only 15 hours a week to produce all that they needed for subsistence and comfort.</p> <p>Developed countries are now about as rich as Keynes thought they would be, but most of us work much longer than 15 hours a week, although we do take longer holidays, and work has become less physically demanding, so we also live longer. But, in broad terms, the prophecy of vastly increased leisure for all has not been fulfilled. Automation has been proceeding apace, but most of us who work still put in an average of 40 hours a week. In fact, working hours have not fallen since the early 1980s.</p> <p>At the same time, \"technological unemployment\" has risen.

      "bodyText": "As people in the developed world wonder how their countries will return to full employment after the global recession, it might benefit us to take a look at a visionary essay that John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1930, called Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren (pdf). Keynes's General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, published in 1936, equipped governments with the intellectual tools to counter the unemployment caused by slumps. In this earlier essay, however, Keynes distinguished between unemployment caused by temporary economic breakdowns and what he called \"technological unemployment\" \u2013 that is, \"unemployment due to the discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour\". Keynes reckoned that we would hear much more about this kind of unemployment in the future. But its emergence, he thought, was a cause for hope, rather than despair. For it showed that the developed world, at least, was on track to solving the \"economic problem\" \u2013 the problem of scarcity that kept mankind tethered to a burdensome life of toil. Machines were rapidly replacing human labour, holding out the prospect of vastly increased production at a fraction of the existing human effort. In fact, Keynes thought that by about now (the early 21st century) most people would have to work only 15 hours a week to produce all that they needed for subsistence and comfort. Developed countries are now about as rich as Keynes thought they would be, but most of us work much longer than 15 hours a week, although we do take longer holidays, and work has become less physically demanding, so we also live longer. But, in broad terms, the prophecy of vastly increased leisure for all has not been fulfilled. Automation has been proceeding apace, but most of us who work still put in an average of 40 hours a week. In fact, working hours have not fallen since the early 1980s. At the same time, \"technological unemployment\" has risen. Since the 1980s, we have never regained the full employment levels of the 1950s and 1960s. If most people still work a 40-hour week, a substantial and growing minority have had unwanted leisure thrust upon them in the form of unemployment, under-employment and forced withdrawal from the labour market. And, as we recover from the current recession, most experts expect this group to grow even larger. What this means is that we have largely failed to convert growing technological unemployment into increased voluntary leisure. The main reason for this is that the lion's share of the productivity gains achieved over the last 30 years has been seized by the well-off. Particularly in the United States and Britain since the 1980s, we have witnessed a return to the capitalism \"red in tooth and claw\" depicted by Karl Marx. The rich and very rich have become very much richer, while everyone else's incomes have stagnated. So most people are not, in fact, four or five times better off than they were in 1930. It is not surprising that they are working longer than Keynes thought they would. But there is something else. Modern capitalism inflames, through every sense and pore, the hunger for consumption. Satisfying that hunger has become the great palliative of modern society, our counterfeit reward for working irrational hours. Advertisers proclaim a single message: your soul is to be discovered in your shopping. Aristotle knew of insatiability only as a personal vice; he had no inkling of the collective, politically orchestrated insatiability that we call economic growth. The civilization of \"always more\" would have struck him as moral and political madness. And, beyond a certain point, it is also economic madness. This is not just or mainly because we will soon enough run up against the natural limits to growth. It is because we cannot go on for much longer economising on labour faster than we can find new uses for it. That road leads to a division of society into a minority of producers, professionals, supervisors, and financial speculators on one side, and a majority of drones and unemployables on the other. Apart from its moral implications, such a society would face a classic dilemma: how to reconcile the relentless pressure to consume with stagnant earnings. So far, the answer has been to borrow, leading to today's massive debt overhangs in advanced economies. Obviously, this is unsustainable, and thus is no answer at all, for it implies periodic collapse of the wealth-producing machine. The truth is that we cannot go on successfully automating our production without rethinking our attitudes toward consumption, work, leisure, and the distribution of income.

But the bus division had a lower average yield per journey as cash-strapped consumers took advantage of value for money period passes and smartcards. Looking ahead the company said: We expect the performance of our bus business to remain strong. In rail we expect slower than assumed economic growth rates to impact performance, and \u00a36m of rail bid costs are forecast next year. This caution has sent the group's shares 22p lower to \u00a311.97. Gert Zonneveld at Panmure Gordon said: We continue to remain cautious about the medium term growth prospects of Go-Ahead. Winning additional rail franchises remains crucial, especially if the company wants to sustain its current level of dividends over the medium to longer term, but we see few catalysts in the short term, with a winner for the new Thameslink franchise not expected until May 2013. We retain our hold recommendation and \u00a312.50 target price.",
