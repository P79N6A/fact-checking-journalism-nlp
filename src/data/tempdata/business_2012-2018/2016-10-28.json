      "bodyText": "A former business minister has said that Nissan had previously suggested it could move production to France if it was not protected from trade tariffs. Anna Soubry said that No 10 must have privately told Nissan that Britain was remaining in the EU customs union or promised mitigation against any future tariffs before the car firm announced plans to build two new models in the UK. Greg Clark, the current business secretary, has insisted that no financial compensation was offered during numerous discussions with Nissan, which allowed the Japanese carmaker to commit to building its new Qashqai and X-Trail vehicles at its Sunderland plant. It is understood that the government provided a \u201cletter of comfort\u201d to Nissan promising that the UK car industry would remain competitive after Brexit. Ministers, however, would neither confirm nor deny whether such a letter had been sent. Sources said the letter was understood to give an undertaking that Nissan would not face \u201cadditional costs\u201d after the UK leaves the EU, implying that the taxpayer could be liable for subsidising the car industry in the event of tariffs being imposed on automotive exports. Downing Street also declined to say if more specific informal promises had been offered to Nissan and by implication to other carmakers, but industry sources have said they have been reassured by the government that they would not suffer from tariffs after the UK leaves the EU. No 10 is under pressure to publish the letter and Clark is to be called before the Commons business committee to explain what he has offered in the way of support to Nissan. Soubry, who was a senior minister in the business department until July, said the carmaker had privately suggested to her in the past it would move production to France if it did not have a guarantee that it would be protected from tariffs or if the government did not do \u201csomething to mitigate the damage of tariffs\u201d. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give the detail of what they wanted, they made it very clear that without a guarantee that they would not be subject to tariffs or if they were subject to tariffs the government would do something to mitigate the damage of tariffs \u2026 that without that, they told me, my understanding actually was that they would go to Renault because they clearly had the capacity there,\u201d she said. The Japanese car company has a strategic partnership with the French manufacturer. On the assurances that helped Nissan decide, Soubry told the BBC: \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is but I would be very surprised if there hasn\u2019t been some sort of guarantee to mitigate any tariffs should they be imposed.\u201d She continued: \u201cI can assure you we were looking at underwriting any tariffs should that be imposed upon us as we leave the EU. So that\u2019s what we were looking at and we were prepared to do. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s changed in the change of government.\u201d Vince Cable, who was business secretary during the coalition, also said the carmaker must have been offered \u201cvery, very substantial\u201d promises. He told the Guardian: \u201cI was involved in discussions with Nissan in their last big round of investment decisions. Even under the coalition they were toying with doing it in France. \u201cI find it impossible to believe they would go ahead without some pretty copper-bottomed promises. These guys do not go making decisions on the basis of vague assurances. That is not the way they operate. \u201cThe only way these big supply chain companies are going to commit themselves to Britain \u2013 and Nissan is the biggest \u2013 is that if they give them guarantees they are not going to be caught up in rules of origin problems, which is what happens if you leave the customs union.\u201d A Downing Street source said whether the UK remained a member of customs union was still one of the \u201clive issues\u201d that had yet to be settled four months on from the Brexit vote. But Cable, who lost his seat at the last election, said the only alternative to staying in the customs union would be a specific sector agreement for the automotive industry, which the EU would be unlikely to want to negotiate. \u201cI cannot see that happening,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cWhy would the EU want to do that? The same problems arise for aerospace, for pharmaceuticals. GSK yesterday was worrying about their supply chain. The only way to make the promise stick is to stay in the customs union.\u201d The automotive industry and Japanese government have for months been highlighting the risks of Brexit for carmakers, including more customs checks and tariffs. Lord Bridges of Headley, a Brexit minister, told a Lords committee this week he was well aware that the customs union and the need for transitional arrangements with the EU to stop tariffs being suddenly imposed were important issues for the industry. \u201cWe do understand the complexities for the car industry. All those things are being fed into the deliberations,\u201d he added. Nissan has also been asking the government for lower energy costs. The Guardian understands the company is considering seeking permission to build a gas power station to provide its own electricity. The 10 wind turbines and a solar panel farm it already has onlyprovide 7% of the Sunderland plant\u2019s electricity needs. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has previously mooted the possibility of financial support for car manufacturers that stops short of directly offsetting tariffs should the UK fail to avoid their imposition when it leaves the EU. \u201cPeople seem to forget that the British government will be in receipt of over \u00a32bn of levies on EU cars alone,\u201d he said in July. \u201cThere is nothing to stop us supporting our indigenous car industry to make it more competitive if we so chose. \u201cWTO [World Trade Organisation] rules would not allow us to explicitly offset the levies charged, but we could do a great deal to support the industry. \u201cResearch support, investment tax breaks, lower vehicle taxes \u2013 there are a whole range of possibilities to protect the industry.\u201d There is now likely to be pressure on No 10 for similar assurances to be given to other industries, including aerospace, pharmaceuticals and freight. Clark is to meet Hitachi, which opened an \u00a382m train manufacturing facility in County Durham in 2015 and had previously said the \u201cfuture investment case\u201d for Britain looked very different if the country was outside the EU. On Friday, a spokesman for the Japanese multinational said it had not received any assurances from ministers so far. But he added: \u201cWhile some matters will require adjustments based on economic agreements yet to be agreed \u2013 for example, tariffs on procurements in the UK from other countries and on exports from Japan, as well as the mobility of manpower within the European region \u2013 we expect that the British government will make every possible effort to minimise effects on the economy.\u201d There is concern that thousands of jobs are at risk at Vauxhall\u2019s UK factories after the carmaker\u2019s US owner warned this week that it could shut plants after taking a $400m (\u00a3330m) hit from the Brexit vote. Vauxhall is to decide next year where it makes the new Astra, which is currently assembled at its Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire, which has more than 2,000 employees. In total, Vauxhall employs 4,500 across its two plants and its warehouse and head office in Luton. Prof David Bailey, of Aston University, said other carmarkers would become more vocal in their demands as big investment decisions neared. \u201cI did expect Nissan to build the Qashqai in the UK. That\u2019s a big, efficient plant in Sunderland and they were well down the road to making the decision. The big questions are going to come at General Motors and Toyota \u2013 those are the plants that are more at risk,\u201d said Bailey. Vauxhall \u2013 a wholly owned subsidiaries of General Motors \u2013 declined to say if it would increase its lobbying of No 10 after the Nissan announcement. But it pointed to a statement it released a day after the EU referendum that read: \u201cCommunication on the development of the future relationship with the EU should also be clear and transparent.\u201d A Vauxhall spokeswoman said it would not comment further on production in the UK until it understood more about government Brexit strategy. Manufacturing and pharmaceutical trade bodies suggested they would not immediately be seeking their own \u201cletters of comfort\u201d. A source at GlaxoSmithKline said the government was listening to the industry\u2019s concerns and that it hoped it would find pragmatic solutions.",

    "webTitle": "Morrisons puts Marmite price up 12.5%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It was dubbed Marmageddon: a very public spat between two of the giants of the grocery business \u2013 Tesco and Unilever \u2013 that saw the supermarket giant refuse to accept price rises on hundreds of Unilever products and that resulted in Marmite disappearing from Tesco\u2019s shelves and website. But on Friday it appeared that while Unilever might have lost that battle, it has won the war \u2013 because smaller supermarket chain Morrisons has now hiked the shelf price of the very British toast-topper by 12.5%, setting off new fears about food price rises in the wake of the Brexit vote. Marmite has become an unlikely symbol of the industry-wide battle over price increases caused by the 14.5% drop in the value of the pound against the euro and 18% against the dollar since the UK voted to leave the European Union. Manufacturers\u2019 costs are rising as they are forced to pay more to import goods, ingredients and packaging, and they are trying to pass some of that on to their retail clients. Unilever, one of the biggest suppliers to British supermarkets, has been trying to increase the price it charges for brands including Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, Persil and Pot Noodle by an average of 10%, blaming the slide in sterling. The move ran into controversy as most of the affected products are made in Britain. Marmite is 100% made in Burton upon Trent, and uses ingredients from the UK. After the public row with Tesco two weeks ago, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain is believed to have reached a compromise on price increases, agreeing average price rises of less than 5%. Sainsbury\u2019s is understood to be still in talks, while Asda is thought to have brought in parent company Walmart, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, to add muscle to its negotiations. The Bradford-based Morrisons chain, however, appears to have given in to Unilever\u2019s demands and is now charging \u00a32.64 for a 250g jar of Marmite, up from \u00a32.35 previously. A spokesman for Morrisons said: \u201cSometimes we have to increase prices as a result of costs rising although we do our best to avoid this.\u201d In the past two weeks, 92 of the 228 Unilever food lines stocked at Morrisons have gone up in price, while only 19 have been reduced, according to the Grocer trade journal, which cited data from market analysis firm Brand View. Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said suppliers were facing huge increases in costs on items such as packaging and all kinds of ingredients, from spices to fruit and vegetables, as the pound had fallen in value. \u201cThe writing is on the wall. Price increases have happened and will continue to happen across the board. Exchange rates are hammering everyone,\u201d he said. One source said that Morrisons had no choice but to pass on price rises from Unilever to shoppers. Other industry insiders suggested the supermarket was making a political point \u2013 trying to highlight the pressure from Unilever by raising prices significantly on one of its most high-profile brands. Such was the furore over the pricing spat with Tesco that sales of the spread soared 60% at the major supermarket chains in a spate of panic buying by fans, according to industry data analysts IRI. In a publicity stunt, Asda cut its 250g Marmite price to \u00a32. Tesco and Waitrose have so far kept their prices at \u00a32.35 and Sainsbury\u2019s has not moved from \u00a32.50. UK consumers have been told to brace themselves for price rises in the coming months. A number of suppliers are understood to have approached supermarkets asking for cost increases to be covered. Earlier this month, KitKat owner Nestl\u00e9 also admitted that prices were likely to have to rise. On Friday, Somnath Saha, chief executive of Typhoo, told the BBC tea prices are set to rise. He said the firm\u2019s costs had gone up by between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3300,000 a month and \u201cunfortunately the cost of a cup will go up\u201d. He said the tea firm\u2019s profits would take a hit: \u201cIn a year\u2019s time there will be an impact of \u00a33m on our bottom line. How can we sustain that? It is affecting us really badly. We are trying to do as much as we can to mitigate this cost but we are coming to a position now that costs need to be passed on.\u201d Justin King, a former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, warned earlier this month that supermarkets could not absorb cost increases caused by the falling pound and that price rises were inevitable. However, supermarket bosses have said that they will try and protect shoppers from price rises, not least because they face rising competition from discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which undercut them on many basic goods. Most retailers buy their currency well in advance so that it will take time for foreign exchange rate changes to feed through. They are also benefiting from commodity price falls in some areas that are helping to offset the fall in the value of the pound. Tough competition from the discount chains has been driving prices down but there are signs the deflation is coming to an end. Market research group Kantar Worldpanel said grocery prices fell by an average 0.8% in the three months to 9 October, but this was the smallest drop in nearly two years.",

      "body": "<p>It was dubbed Marmageddon: a very public spat between two of the giants of the grocery business \u2013 Tesco and Unilever \u2013 that saw the supermarket giant refuse to accept price rises on hundreds of Unilever products and that resulted in Marmite disappearing from Tesco\u2019s shelves and website.</p> <p>But on Friday it appeared that while Unilever might have lost that battle, it has won the war \u2013 because smaller supermarket chain Morrisons has now hiked the shelf price of the very British toast-topper by 12.5%, setting off new fears about food price rises in the wake of the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Marmite has become an unlikely symbol of the industry-wide battle over price increases caused by the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/03/uk-stocks-rally-as-brexit-fears-fade\">14.5% drop in the value of the pound against the euro</a> and 18% against the dollar since the UK voted to leave the European Union. Manufacturers\u2019 costs are rising as they are forced to pay more to import goods, ingredients and packaging, and they are trying to pass some of that on to their retail clients.</p> <p>Unilever, one of the biggest suppliers to British supermarkets, has been trying to increase the price it charges for brands including Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, Persil and Pot Noodle by an average of 10%, blaming the slide in sterling. The move ran into controversy as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/unilever-tesco-list-brands-affected-price-row\">most of the affected products are made in Britain</a>. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/13/little-sympathy-unilever-in-town-burton-upon-trent-marmite-is-made\">Marmite is 100% made in Burton upon Trent</a>, and uses ingredients from the UK.</p> <p>After the public row with Tesco two weeks ago, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain is believed to have reached a compromise on price increases, agreeing average price rises of less than 5%. Sainsbury\u2019s is understood to be still in talks, while Asda is thought to have brought in parent company Walmart, the world\u2019s biggest retailer, to add muscle to its negotiations. </p> <p>The Bradford-based Morrisons chain, however, appears to have given in to Unilever\u2019s demands and is now charging \u00a32.64 for a 250g jar of Marmite, up from \u00a32.35 previously.</p> <p>A spokesman for Morrisons said: \u201cSometimes we have to increase prices as a result of costs rising although we do our best to avoid this.\u201d</p> <p>In the past two weeks, 92 of the 228 Unilever food lines stocked at Morrisons have gone up in price, while only 19 have been reduced, according to the Grocer trade journal, which cited data from market analysis firm Brand View.</p> <p>Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst at TCC Global, said suppliers were facing huge increases in costs on items such as packaging and all kinds of ingredients, from spices to fruit and vegetables, as the pound had fallen in value.<br></p> <p>\u201cThe writing is on the wall. Price increases have happened and will continue to happen across the board. Exchange rates are hammering everyone,\u201d he said.</p> <p>One source said that Morrisons had no choice but to pass on price rises from Unilever to shoppers. Other industry insiders suggested the supermarket was making a political point \u2013 trying to highlight the pressure from Unilever by raising prices significantly on one of its most high-profile brands.</p> <p>Such was the furore over the pricing spat with Tesco  that sales of the spread soared 60% at the major supermarket chains in a spate of panic buying by fans, according to industry data analysts IRI.</p> <p>In a publicity stunt, Asda cut its 250g Marmite price to \u00a32. Tesco and Waitrose have so far kept their prices at \u00a32.35 and Sainsbury\u2019s has not moved from \u00a32.50.</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/12/british-shoppers-told-to-expect-price-rises-after-steep-fall-in-pound\">UK consumers have been told to brace themselves for price rises</a> in the coming months. A number of suppliers are understood to have approached supermarkets asking for cost increases to be covered. Earlier this month, KitKat owner <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/20/nestle-hints-at-price-rise-to-offset-weak-pound\">Nestl\u00e9 also admitted that prices were likely to have to rise</a>.</p> <p>On Friday, Somnath Saha, chief executive of Typhoo, told the BBC tea prices are set to rise. He said the firm\u2019s costs had gone up by between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3300,000 a month and \u201cunfortunately the cost of a cup will go up\u201d.</p> <p>He said the tea firm\u2019s profits would take a hit: \u201cIn a year\u2019s time there will be an impact of \u00a33m on our bottom line. How can we sustain that? It is affecting us really badly. We are trying to do as much as we can to mitigate this cost but we are coming to a position now that costs need to be passed on.\u201d</p> <p>Justin King, a former boss of Sainsbury\u2019s, warned earlier this month that supermarkets could not absorb cost increases caused by the falling pound and that price rises were inevitable.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>However, supermarket bosses have said that they will try and protect shoppers from price rises, not least because they face rising competition from discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which undercut them on many basic goods.</p> <p>Most retailers buy their currency well in advance so that it will take time for foreign exchange rate changes to feed through. They are also benefiting from commodity price falls in some areas that are helping to offset the fall in the value of the pound. </p> <p>Tough competition from the discount chains has been driving prices down but there are signs the deflation is coming to an end. Market research group Kantar Worldpanel said grocery prices fell by an average 0.8% in the three months to 9 October, but this was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/18/tesco-increases-grocery-market-share-sales-rise\">the smallest drop in nearly two years</a>. </p>",

    "webTitle": "Q&A: why Brexit is so important to Nissan (and Britain)", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "How could Brexit hurt Nissan? The Japanese carmaker\u2019s British arm, Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), sold 481,000 cars in the year to the end of March 2015, racking up sales of nearly \u00a35.3bn. About 55% of those sales were exports to Europe, meaning annual sales to the EU bloc in that year totalled \u00a32.9bn . The EU applies a 10% tariff to cars imported from outside the single market, meaning Nissan could face a \u00a3290m annual Brexit bill if no free trade deal is struck. It could also face extra customs and VAT costs. What can the UK offer Nissan? The prime minister could seek a special free trade deal with the EU for the automotive sector, on the basis that the UK is a very big destination for European car sales and that tariffs could harm EU manufacturers more. But if Theresa May has made promises to Nissan based on winning that argument, it is a very big gamble indeed. That implies some other form of support has been agreed for Nissan. The EU has rules curbing the use of state aid, to prevent countries propping up companies and industries to the disadvantage of competitors from fellow member states. However, there are exemptions available. One exemption applies to companies who operate in so-called assisted areas \u2013 regions deemed in need of economic support. This permits investment in areas such as training and job creation \u2013 two pledges rumoured to have been made to Nissan. Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant is bang in the middle of one of those assisted areas, meaning it can get grants of 10% of the value of an investment project. Other exemptions apply, including for research and development, investment in energy efficiency and relief from environmental taxes. So what\u2019s the problem? For a start, if Nissan really does expect a \u00a3300m hit, it\u2019s unlikely that existing exemptions could offset that, even if they were all applied at the maximum rate. \u201cMy feeling is that if it was within one of the exemptions, the government and/or Nissan would have said that,\u201d said one state aid lawyer. Another problem is that it is not just Nissan that wants help. While Nissan owns the largest car plant in the UK, it isn\u2019t the only carmaker here and the others will want similar guarantees and assistance. Other major sites include Vauxhall\u2019s plants in Luton and Ellesmere Port, Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s facilities in the West Midlands and Cheshire and Toyota\u2019s plant at Burnaston, Derbyshire. All of those fall within assisted areas too, meaning they have a good case for demanding their own pay-to-stay packages. Why do EU rules matter if we\u2019re leaving? If the UK isn\u2019t in the single market \u2013 so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d \u2013 then World Trade Organisation rules on state aid would apply. These prohibit subsidies designed to boost exports, but are generally less stringent than the EU regime, which might indicate May would have a freer hand. But Caroline Ramsay, a state aid expert with law firm Pinsent Masons, says it is not that simple. \u201cWTO would make it easier to give state aid, but we\u2019re still going to have to negotiate a trade deal with the EU,\u201d she said. \u201cThe UK\u2019s ability to do that will be severely impacted if it is not applying state aid rules of a similar nature to the EU.\u201d So what is May up to? One state aid lawyer, who asked not to be named, said the opacity around the promises made to Nissan suggest May has decided to improvise, without offering concrete terms. \u201cPerhaps as part of the Brexit fever they\u2019ve just decided they won\u2019t follow the rule book,\u201d he suggested. But he warned: \u201cThat would be unwise. The EU won\u2019t engage with us if we\u2019re subsidising our businesses.\u201d",

The 45-year-old married father of two who lives in Hounslow, west London, declared the ruling on Friday as a victory for working people across the UK. \u201cWhen I started for Uber, I was taking home around \u00a3500 to \u00a3600 a week which sounds fine, but once I\u2019ve paid all the costs it was much less than promised.

      "bodyText": "Retailers are already being forced to cut the price of their winter ranges as yet another mild autumn wilts demand on the high street for warmclothing. Department store chains House of Fraser and Debenhams are offering up to 30% off coats, knitwear and boots this weekend, forcing rival John Lewis into a round of price matching due to its Never Knowingly Undersold price promise. Other stores ranging from Hobbs to Phase Eight and Monsoon are also trying to drum up business with selected discounts, while Whistles is offering up to \u00a350 off coats and knitwear. David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said retailers were trying to kickstart spending as shoppers were holding back on purchases in the weeks leading up to Black Friday, the online shopping bonanza at the end of November. \u201cLast year, Black Friday was bigger than Christmas, with promotions running over four days, so people are holding off spending and that diminishes retailers\u2019 sales in the weeks before and after,\u201d he said. Fashion retailers are struggling to win over shoppers at a time when spending their disposable income on leisure activities such as eating out and holidays has become more popular. Analysts at Kantar Worldpanel said earlier this month that spending on clothes and footwear in the UK had dropped to its lowest level in seven years. Its figures showed that shoppers spent \u00a3700m less on clothing, shoes and accessories in the year to 25 September than they had during the previous 12 months. On Tuesday, Debenhams said its clothing business had fared slightly better than the 4% decline seen across the market in the past six months as growth in holiday clothing, including swimwear, and outfits for special occasions rose, while sales of everyday clothing slid. \u201cMaybe gone are the days of just buying. You have got to really want something to buy,\u201d said Suzanne Harlow, the group\u2019s trading director. The weather has not been kind to fashion industry executives in recent years, with mild winters followed by erratic summer temperatures making it difficult to persuade Britons to update their wardrobes at the start of a new season. However, some of the malaise in spending was self-inflicted, said McCorquodale: \u201cFashion retailers have tried to straddle the seasons, but have not done a particularly good job of it. A lot of the fashion has just not been that inspirational.\u201d The cold snap earlier this month provided clothing chains with a much-needed boost, according to the weekly high street sales tracker produced by advisory firm BDO, which monitors the performance of mid-sized fashion chains. However, its latest data shows sales are once again falling, with like-for-likes down 1.21% in the week to Sunday 23 October. \u201cWhile some of the upscale and bespoke fashion retailers enjoyed moderate boosts, this was offset by declining sales amongst mid-range fashion retailers and across the peer group,\u201d said BDO. Analysts are keenly watching how clothing market leader Marks &amp; Spencer reacts to the tough trading environment. Its new boss, Steve Rowe, appears to be holding his nerve, with the most notable winter promotion being a chance to buy a wool scarf for \u00a35 when customers spend \u00a340. Rowe is trying to wean the retailer off an over-reliance on discounting after more than 40% of its clothing was sold on promotion last year.",

    "webTitle": "Uber loses landmark employment tribunal case \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And back with Uber, here is our roundup of the tribunal\u2019s comments, from Shane Hickey: On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back next week. And on whether and when it might chance its views, S&amp;P said: We could lower the rating if we conclude that sterling will lose its status as a reserve currency or if public finances or GDP per capita weaken markedly beyond our current expectations. In addition, we could lower our ratings if significant constitutional issues arise and create further financial and economic uncertainty. We could revise the outlook to stable if investment and economic growth remain above our expectations, while negotiations with the EU prove amicable and not significantly detrimental to the U.K.\u2019s economy and trade. S&amp;P is also forecasting a slowdown in the UK from next year: Given Brexit uncertainties and the likely fall in investment, we are forecasting a slowdown in 2017-2019, with GDP growth averaging 1%. The Bank of England\u2019s asset purchase plan and the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s decision to reduce the base rate have helped growth in the short term, but we expect reduced investment to begin to weigh on growth over our forecast period. Warming to its theme, S&amp;P added: The negative outlook reflects our opinion that the recent decision to exit the European Union (the destination for 44% of the U.K.\u2019s goods and services exports) poses a potential risk to the U.K.\u2019s national income, as well as its fiscal and external balances. We also see heightened risks of a deterioration in external financing conditions in light of the U.K.\u2019s high gross external financing requirements (as a share of current account receipts and usable reserves). Complex and protracted negotiations between the U.K. and the EU could, in our opinion, pressure the U.K.\u2019s financial services sector (which is a major contributor to employment and public receipts). We also think Brexit could create challenging constitutional issues if it results in a second referendum on Scottish independence. Leaving the EU will also significantly diminish the U.K.\u2019s capacity to influence EU policy on key sectors of the U.K. economy, such as financial services, that are vital to the U.K.\u2019s economic performance. Brexit could also, over time, diminish sterling\u2019s role as a global reserve currency. Since the referendum, sterling has depreciated against the dollar by more than 17%, at one point reaching a 31-year low. In early October, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the government will invoke Article 50 of the EU\u2019s Lisbon Treaty no later than March 2017. This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer. The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements. In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u2019s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view. Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable. We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters. In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU. Such a move will have consequences for the U.K.\u2019s constitutional and economic integrity. Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues. These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u2019s institutional strengths. The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers. In our opinion, significant net immigration into the U.K. over the past decade helped its economic performance. EU membership has also enhanced London\u2019s position as a global financial center. The ratings agency said: In our opinion, Brexit presents a significant risk to the U.K.\u2019s track record of strong economic performance, and to its large financial sector in particular. The leave result has also led to a less predictable and stable policy framework for the U.K... The outlook remains negative, reflecting the continued institutional and economic uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations, and what arrangements will emerge post-departure. S&amp;P has issued its latest update on the UK following the Brexit vote, and it has kept its rating at AA with a negative outlook given the future uncertainties. As we reported earlier, S&amp;P had cut the UK\u2019s rating by two notches on the Monday after the referendum result. Back with stock markets, and European shares have ended on an uncertain note. French and Spanish GDP figures gave some support while stronger than expected US growth increased the chances of a Federal Reserve rate rise before the end of the year. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 9.69 points or 0.14% at 6996.26 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.19% to 10,696.19 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.33% at 4548.58 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.59% to 17,324.23 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.04% at 9201.3 In Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.13% to 588.67 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 71 points or 0.39%. So what effect could the Uber decision have on the gig economy? Crowley Woodford, employment partner at Ashurst, reckons a huge one: This decision could be the beginning of the end for the gig economy as we know it and will have wide implications for a number of employers beyond Uber, inevitably leading to a flood of further claims. Labour is tabling an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. The amendment, if it is accepted on Tuesday, would extend employment rights to workers at firms like Uber who operate in the gig economy. The clause, tabled by shadow digital minister Louise Haigh, would change the law so that workers at companies who provide a service to customers through a digital \u2018intermediary\u2019 such as Uber are defined as employees of that business. Today\u2019s tribunal ruling only applies to Uber and the US-based company plans to challenge it anyway. Louise Haigh said: \u2018This amendment will, for the first time, enshrine in statute the rights of workers in the digital economy; the right to be designated as employees and their right to sick and holiday pay so that if companies like Uber try to wriggle out of their responsibilities by appealing this extraordinarily welcome decision today, they will have nowhere to go.\u201d Here\u2019s a piece from Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, on the Uber verdict: And here\u2019s a response from the government. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, said: The Government is committed to building an economy that works for all. We are keen to ensure our employment rules keep up to date to reflect new ways of working, and that\u2019s why the Government has asked Matthew Taylor to conduct an independent review into modern working practices. Clearer rules are needed to determine whether someone is an employee, a worker or self-employed, says Citizens Advice. Chief executive Gillian Guy said: The fact it takes an employment tribunal to decide whether these drivers are self-employed shows that proving employment status is an extremely complicated and costly process. For many people struggling at the sharp end of insecure work, such as in false self-employment, taking such a case is simply not an option - not least because of employment tribunal fees of up to \u00a31,200. To address this Citizens Advice is keen the government considers introducing an effective online test people could use which would determine their employment status. It is encouraging to see the government is keen to tackle the challenges brought by insecure work. It\u2019s very positive that the Prime Minister has announced an independent review of modern employment and that the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) committee is to investigate the rights and treatment of non-permanent staff. The full Uber judgement and the reasons for the decision are online here. The courts have done their job with the Uber ruling but the UK Parliament will have to step in to set laws for the new economy, says Torsten Bell at the Resolution Foundation: As a country we have two ways of resolving legal uncertainty \u2013 our courts and Parliament. The first of these has done its work today, and will be called up to do so again on this and related topics in the years ahead. But in the end it is Parliament\u2019s job to opine on how our law should be updated to respond to developments in the real world. That\u2019s why it\u2019s good that both the Business Select Committee and the government themselves have launched reviews of existing employment legislation, although as with all reviews it\u2019s what is actually done with them that matters. New technology is by and large a good thing \u2013 but the old fashioned wish for certainty in what the law means for the jobs we do, pounds we earn and tax we pay remains as important as ever. The courts can do their bit to interpret our law in the face of changes, but in the end it is for government and Parliament to give us a law fit for that new world. The full piece is here. Not just minium wage and holiday pay, but also a company pension could be on the cards for Uber drivers after the tribunal decision. Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: This is great news for anyone working in the gig economy as it means they are more likely to be eligible for a workplace pension, with all the attendant benefits and in particular the highly valuable employer contribution. It is also going to be a challenge for Uber and employers like them, in deciding what specific pension terms they want to offer their employees. They have some latitude on earnings definitions and deferral periods but however they deal with this, it is going to cost them time and money. Back with Uber, and the tribunal decision must not discourage firms from using the self-employed, according to trade body IPSE. Chris Bryce, chief executive of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed, said: Today\u2019s decision gives Uber drivers clarity around their relationship with Uber, subject to Uber\u2019s intended appeal. As far as IPSE is concerned self-employment means you\u2019re in control, and that must remain a positive choice. If companies want to control exactly how or when their workers do the actual work, they must not shirk their responsibility to provide employment protections and pay their employer\u2019s National Insurance Contributions too. If they want to engage workers on a freelance basis, then they must be business-like in that relationship. We will be studying the full judgement carefully to consider its implications, but this ruling may have an impact on the wider gig economy. The recently launched review of employment practices takes on even greater urgency and importance in light of today\u2019s ruling. However, Government must be careful not to dissuade firms from making use of the highly-skilled, on-demand flexible workforce as a whole. The vast majority of people who work this way made an active choice to do so and cherish their self-employed status. Athough... here is a sign of a weaker US economy. The University of Michigan consumer confidence index has come in weaker than expected at 87.2 in October. This is lower than the initial estimate of 87.9 and forecasts of 88.1, and is well below September\u2019s figure of 91.2. Back with US GDP for a moment, and Wall Street has moved ahead in early trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 30 points or nearly 0.2%. The strong growth figure means it is increasingly likely the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates before the end of the year, in December if not ahead of the election. Alex Lydall, head of dealing at Foenix Partners, said: The US took a giant step towards the execution phase of interest rate hikes this afternoon after an aggressively positive Q3 growth print registered at 1.5%. With the Fed already being split on those in favour of a rate hike last month, progress appears to be pointing towards a post-election hike at year-end. Meanwhile more on those soybeans: Although Uber is appealing the tribunal decision, a number of commentators have said it could open the door to further claims. Alan Price, employment law director at advisory group Peninsula, said: Whilst this decision is only at employment tribunal level... the case could have large consequences for businesses run on a similar model. There is already a related claim supported by a different union in the pipeline against the courier firm City Sprint. Not only could this decision lead to an influx of tribunal claims, but it can lead to large financial penalties for businesses who have not given staff their correct legal rights. Aye Limbin Glassey, employment partner at Shakespeare Martineau, said: The ruling will not only impact Uber but a whole number of other industries and businesses which use self-employed workers. It is by no means the end of the issue - continued pressure from trade unions calling for tighter regulations means that the Uber ruling will likely be a catalyst for further scrutiny. The very nature of a business like Uber is the flexibility it offers. However, employment practices cannot be left unregulated and rights of workers and employees cannot be ignored unless businesses are willing and ready to face the backlash of legal and reputational repercussions. It is stark reality that the application of employment rights will often mean that companies are unable to adopt the agility needed to support its success. With consumer convenience the driver of many fast-growing businesses, it is likely that we\u2019ll see more businesses of this nature coming to market and using self-employed workers will become a greater concern for companies. Here\u2019s our report on the Uber verdict, from Hilary Osborne: Drivers for Uber have won a landmark case after employment tribunal judges ruled that they were not self-employed and should be paid the national living wage. The case could open up the technology firm to claims from all of its 40,000 drivers in the UK, and force other companies in the so-called gig economy to review the way that they are employing staff. It is likely that the firm will appeal against the finding. The ride hailing app had argued that the drivers were independent contractors who are self-employed and can choose where and when they work. But an employment tribunal in London found that this was not the case. The full story is here: The Uber ruling is disappointing for its 40,000 drivers and consumers alike, according to the Adam Smith Institute. Sam Dumitriu, head of projects at the think tank, said: Nearly 80% of Uber drivers preferred being self-employed and being their own boss, saying in a recent poll that they wouldn\u2019t trade that status for some of the benefits like holiday pay, pension contributions and the National Minimum Wage. Uber drivers typically earn well above the National Living Wage. Across the UK, the average driver earns \u00a316 an hour, that\u2019s after Uber has taken their commission, but before you factor in extra costs like insurance, petrol and car payments. One you factor that in it comes to around \u00a312 an hour, still well above the minimum wage. It\u2019s higher for drivers in London and it\u2019s higher for drivers who work at peak times like Saturday evening. Consumers will see prices rise and a less stable, predictable service. And this doesn\u2019t just hit Uber. It threatens other new business models like Deliveroo and Amazon Prime Now. Unions are understandably delighted to have won today\u2019s case against Uber. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says it\u2019s an important step towards cleaning up the \u2018gig economy\u2019 (which relies on temporary, often low paid, workers). \u201cThe GMB deserve huge credit for a shining light on conditions at Uber and winning this landmark action. \u201cThis case has exposed the dark side of so-called \u2018flexible\u2019 labour. For many workers the gig economy is a rigged economy, where bosses can get out of paying the minimum wage and providing basics like paid holidays and rest breaks. O\u2019Grady adds that Theresa May\u2019s government also needs to take action to prevent workers being exploited: \u201cWhat is happening at Uber is just the tip of the iceberg. Lots of people are now trapped in insecure jobs, with low pay and no voice at work. \u201cWe need the government to get tough on sham self-employment. The Taylor review of employment practices must be a no-holds-barred investigation. And it must recognise the important role trade unions can play in ending precarious working.\u201d The Uber ruling could trigger a wave of claims from workers at other companies. Frank Ryan, employment lawyer at legal firm Vardags, says: \u201cThis is a landmark decision which is guaranteed to have widespread implications: for Uber itself, its workers, the paying public, black cab drivers and other workers in the so called gig economy. While each case turns on its own facts, this is essentially a green light for others in the gig economy to come forward and make similar claims. Ryan also argues that consumers could end up paying more for cab rides: While potentially good news for black cab drivers, who have always struggled to compete with Uber and who will already have been encouraged by the Mayor of London\u2019s package of reforms for the taxi sector, it\u2019s ultimately bad news for the consumer. It is surely unavoidable that Uber will look to pass the resultant increased costs onto the paying customer. Uber has swiftly responded, saying it will appeal against the UK tribunal ruling that its drivers should be treated as employees. It argues that most drivers are happy with the current situation. Jo Bertram, regional general manager of Uber in the UK, says: \u201cTens of thousands of people in London drive with Uber precisely because they want to be self-employed and their own boss. The overwhelming majority of drivers who use the Uber app want to keep the freedom and flexibility of being able to drive when and where they want. While the decision of this preliminary hearing only affects two people we will be appealing it.\u201d Newsflash: Back in London, the lawyers representing a group of Uber drivers say they have won a court case, at which they argued that the workers are employed by the taxi hire firm. The ruling means that Uber drivers will be entitled to employment benefits, and could be a major moment in the evolution of the new \u2018gig\u2019 economy. They say: The London Central Employment Tribunal has found that a group of Uber drivers are workers and are entitled to receive the National Minimum Wage and holiday pay. In a landmark ruling that follows a hearing in July, which will affect tens of thousands of Uber drivers, the Employment Tribunal has ruled today that a group of Uber drivers are not self-employed but are workers who are entitled to essential workers\u2019 rights including to be paid the National Minimum Wage and receive paid holiday. Here\u2019s the full statement: Historic victory for Uber drivers as Tribunal finds they are entitled to basic workers\u2019 rights The US economy has regained momentum, says Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. He writes: The stand-out in the third quarter was the 10.0% surge in exports. Admittedly, some of that surge was due to a one-off spike in soybean exports, which will be reversed in the fourth quarter, but it is still a welcome sign that the dollar appreciation in 2014 and 2015 is no longer weighing on exporters. Overall, net exports added 0.8% points to GDP growth. After being a sizeable drag on growth for the preceding five quarters, inventories added a further 0.6% points. But....Ashworth also points out that not everything was rosy: Consumption growth slowed to 2.1%, residential investment contracted by 6.2% and equipment investment fell by 2.7% Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at City trading firm Xtrade, believes US interest rates are now likely to rise in December. \u201cThe last time US GDP growth surged past two per cent the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. With today\u2019s numbers flying above that watermark, history may be about to repeat itself. \u201cThe world\u2019s largest economy is being fuelled by a buoyant jobs market, strong levels of consumer spending and healthy trade. If the indicators continue to point upwards for the US then Fed Chair Janet Yellen will look to stop things boiling over. \u201cMany believe that today\u2019s big bump in growth will assure a December rate rise, but with a US election just weeks away, nothing is certain.\u201d What does this stronger growth mean for US interest rates? On balance, you\u2019d expect that stronger growth raises the chances that the Federal Reserve hikes borrowing costs at its December meeting. Investor Adrial Miller thinks to: But....Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, argues that some Fed policymakers could make a case for holding rates again: At 2.9%, the US economy has just posted its strongest growth rate in two years! That should be a boost for the Democratic Party, as they head into November\u2019s elections. More detail... Business fixed investment (in, say, factories) rose by an annual rate of 1.2%. However, spending on new equipment dropped by 2.7%; the fourth quarter running where companies cut back. Government spending picked up a little, adding 0.09% to the GDP rate. US growth last quarter was driven by a surge in exports, including soybeans, and more companies choosing to restock their inventories. Exports increased by 10%, at a 10 percent rate, the biggest rise since the fourth quarter of 2013. And businesses piled up new stock at an annual rate of $12.6bn, compared to running them down at a rate of $9.5bn in Q2. That suggests that firms are more optimistic about growth prospects. But consumer spending has eased back. It only grew by 2.1%, compared with 4.3% three months ago. Some instant reaction to the better-than-expected US growth figures: Breaking: The US economy grew by an annualised rate of 2.9% in the last three months, stronger than expected. That\u2019s a big jump on the 1.4% annualised growth recorded between April and June, and suggests America\u2019s economy is strengthening. A 2.9% growth rate is the equivalent of just over 0.7% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, so America is growing faster than Britain (+0.5%). More to follow! What should we watch out for in the US GDP report? Here\u2019s some ideas: Will growth burst over the 2% mark, and even threaten 3%? Will consumer spending continue to drive growth? Will businesses keep spending on research and intellectual property? R&amp;D spending spiked sharply in the second quarter, so it could have faded. Will companies restock their inventories? They ran them down in Q2, which held back growth Will government spending fall? It did earlier this year - another reason Q2 growth was weak. This preview has more details: Tension is building in the markets as investors await the first estimate of America\u2019s growth in the third quarter of 2016, in 30 minutes time. The US GDP report is due at 8.30am New York time, or 1.30pm in the UK. Wall Street expect the US economy grew by an annualised rate of around 2.5% in July to September, up from 1.4% in the second quarter of 2016. That\u2019s the equivalent of a 0.6% quarterly rate. Economist reckon that consumer spending, and rising exports, drove growth up in the last three months. The figures are eagerly awaited, as they could determine whether the US Federal Reserve raises interest rates in December; they could also influence next month\u2019s elections too. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, sums it up Growth is expected to have picked up from the previous quarter, and there is speculation that good figures could mean an interest rate hike before Christmas. With the US Presidential election less than 2 weeks away, all eyes will be on the current state of the economy and the effect it could have on an election which is likely to have a large effect on global markets depending on the result. As was the case in the lead up to the EU Referendum, this could potentially be a nervous time for economists, currencies and markets alike.\u201d Although we\u2019ve had French, Spanish and Austrian GDP today, we have to wait until Monday to learn how the wider eurozone fared over the summer. Economists are predicting another quarter of unspectacular growth, of around 0.3%. A lot depends on Germany and Italy, of course, and their GDP report isn\u2019t formally released until November 15! Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight has some predictions: We expect German GDP expansion to have come in at 0.3-0.4% quarter-on-quarter, which would be in line with the 0.4% quarter-on-quarter expansion seen in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect Italian GDP to have crept up just 0.1% quarter-on-quarter having been flat in the second quarter. Austria\u2019s economy has racked up another quarter of solid growth, with GDP increasing by 0.4% in the July-to-September period. That\u2019s up from 0.3% in Q2, with consumer spending pushing growth higher. Heads up (2): Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s is expected to publish a review of the UK\u2019s credit rating tonight. We\u2019re not expecting any major action, as little has really changed since the EU referendum. But you never know.... S&amp;P hit the UK with a double-notch downgrade on the Monday following the Brexit vote (just as the English team exited the European Championship ignominiously with a defeat to mighty Iceland). Jordan Rochester of Nomura says: The rating.. is perhaps unlikely to be changed today given the S&amp;P\u2019s stated criteria as to what would lead to a downgrade further have not yet taken place (public finances to deteriorate, GDP per capita to fall, GBP to lose its reserve currency status, Scottish Referendum \u201cthe sequel\u201d or other significant constitutional issues) Heads up (1): A court will rule this afternoon whether taxi-app firm Uber has breached UK law and not provided drivers with basic employment rights. The case goes to the heart of the \u2018gig\u2019 economy; Uber argues that the drivers are self-employed, while unions say that they are effectively employed by Uber, so are entitled to holiday pay, sick pay, a guaranteed minimum wage and breaks. The ruling is due at 2pm BST..... Ouch. The pound just had another one of its little moments, dropping sharply to an eight-day low against the euro (at \u20ac1.1117). Sterling is lost all its early gains against the US dollar, hitting a three-day low of $1.2126. The trigger is news from Belfast, where campaigners have lost a court case against the UK government over Brexit. They had argued that Westminster could not begin the formal legal process for leaving the EU without a parliamentary vote. They claimed that using the royal prerogative to trigger article 50 would breach Northern Irish law. But the Northern Ireland high court has just ruled against them. This has weakened the pound, as it removes one obstacle in the path of Brexit. However.... another court case, arguing that MPs must vote on Article 50, is still running in London. I\u2019d wrongly expected eurozone inflation data today; turns out that\u2019s coming on Monday. Instead, the European Commission\u2019s latest economic confidence figures have just landed - showing that firms are the most confident they\u2019ve been all year. The EC\u2019s economic sentiment indicator rose to 106.3 in October from 104.9 in September, beating expectations of a small decline. That\u2019s the highest reading seen in 2016. And the business climate indicator rose to 0.55 from 0.44 in September, its highest reading since July 2011. This could be an encouraging sign that the eurozone economy is picking up (despite France missing growth forecasts this morning). Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says: This adds to the evidence that Eurozone economies may well be gaining some growth momentum over the final months of 2016 after activity has stuttered since the first quarter. Indeed, the rise in Eurozone economic sentiment to a 10-month high in October follows on from the purchasing managers\u2019 survey showing that overall Eurozone manufacturing and services output picked up to a 2016 high in October. This morning\u2019s GDP data hasn\u2019t brought much cheer to Europe\u2019s stock markets. The main indices are all in the red this morning, as traders fret about this week\u2019s bond selloff. In London, the FTSE 100 has dropped 40 points, or 0.6%. Here\u2019s the damage: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says the sellers are back in charge: Markets cannot seem to catch a break at the moment, for with every rise comes an inevitable drop. He predicts that bonds will remain under pressure (for the reasons outlined earlier): Bond yields are on the rise, following on from an incredible multiyear period of strength in bond prices. In an environment of rising inflation, and an increasingly likely US December rate hike, there is a chance that we will see yields continue to rise for some time yet. Coming at a time when stocks are tumbling, this highlights that the move out of bonds is more to do with economics (which often move inverse to the FTSE) than risk attitudes Analysts at Rabobank are calling the bond market sell-off a\u201dbloodbath\u201d, Reuters flags up. John Reid, a market strategist at Deutsche Bank, is also concerned, saying: \u201cBond markets are facing a recurring nightmare at the moment as we continue to see yields rise sharply.\u201d Some investors risk getting their fingers burned. Or worse.... There are some serious moves in the bond market this morning, as investors pull money out of sovereign debt. The yield, or interest rate, of UK 10-year gilts has hit 1.3% for the first time since the Brexit vote. That means the price of the bonds has dropped. Gilt yields have been climbing steadily this month, and that means the government\u2019s cost of borrowing has gone up. Britain isn\u2019t alone, though. German 10-year bund yields have hit their highest level since May, while Italian 10-year bonds are at an eight-month high. Rising bond yields implies two things Inflation is going up, so investors want a higher rate of return for holding government debt Investors suspect that central banks will tighten monetary policy soon, after years of buying up government bonds through QE (driving down prices). It\u2019s a volatile picture, though - this tweet shows how shorter-dated German bond yields jumped, then fell back..... The pound remains subdued this morning, up just 0.15% at $1.218. That\u2019s almost 18% below its pre-referendum values, which is now feeding into import costs... Adam Posen, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee, is pretty gloomy about Brexit. Asked on Bloomberg TV whether there was anything positive about Britain\u2019s looming exit from the European Union, Posen replied \u201cNo\u201d. Of course, he added, the economy will survive, the City will survive in a smaller state -- but people will be worse off in 10 years. Posen, who now runs America\u2019s Peterson Institute, then elaborated: Brexit is going to be an ongoing source of chronic pain for the UK for many years. It is going to put the UK in many ways back to where it was in the 70s and early 80s. Being uncompetitive, people having less faith in the stability of the regime. The Spanish GDP report is online here. Newsflash: Spain\u2019s economy remains impressively immune to the political deadlock that has gripped the country this year. Spanish GDP expanded by 0.7% in the last quarter, new figures show. That\u2019s another quarter of solid growth, beating France (+0.2%) and the UK (+0.5%), a However, it\u2019s slightly lower than the 0.8% we\u2019d got use to seeing: On an annual basis, Spain expanded by a healthy looking 3.2%: Spain has been stuck with a caretaker government since January, with two general elections failing to deliver a clear winner. Tomorrow, the Spanish parliament will hold a confidence vote that will decide whether acting prime minister Mariano Rajoy gets a second term. The Socialist party is expected to abstain, paving the way for a new Rajoy administration, despite ongoing opposition to his austerity programme. More here: Spain\u2019s Rajoy looks to Saturday vote to form new government France\u2019s finance minister, Michel Sapin, has admitted that the government may miss its growth targets this year, after this morning\u2019s GDP figures missed expectations. Reuters has the details: Weaker than expected economic growth in the third quarter makes its harder to reach the French government\u2019s growth target of 1.5% this year but does not cast doubt on the 2017 goal, also 1.5 %, Finance Minister Michel Sapin said on Friday. \u201cIt makes it harder to reach 1.5 percent this year, I won\u2019t deny it, but it doesn\u2019t call into question next year\u2019s growth figures,\u201d Sapin told RTL radio. The economy grew a slim 0.2 percent in the third quarter of2016, undershooting expectations for a stronger rebound after asmall contraction in the previous three months, official data showed earlier, as consumer spending stalled. Another quarter, another loss from Britain\u2019s taxpayer-controlled bank. Royal Bank of Scotland has posted a \u00a3469m loss for the last quarter, twice as much as analysts expected. Bad behaviour by bankers is partly to blame; RBS is taking a \u00a3425m charge to cover legacy misconduct. It has also run up \u00a3469m of restructuring charges, partly due to its struggles to sell its Williams &amp; Glyn branch network. RBS admits that it won\u2019t settle this deal by the end of 2017, as it had hoped. CEO Ross McEwan says: \u201cWe\u2019ve said that 2015 and 2016 would be noisy as we work through legacy issues and transform this bank for customers. These results reflect that noise.\u201d It\u2019s now eight years since the UK government bailed out RBS. Today\u2019s results suggest there\u2019s little chance of extracting the taxpayers\u2019 money anytime soon.... More reaction, from Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi: Economists are disappointed that France didn\u2019t grow faster in the last quarter. Here\u2019s Holger Sandte of Nordea Market: Bloomberg are also underwhelmed (and also flag up that we should get Spanish GDP today too). Disappointingly, France\u2019s annual growth rate has dipped to 1.1%: France\u2019s economy has been quite bumpy over the last two years, as this graph shows: And growth of 0.2% may not be enough to restore confidence in president Francois Hollande, with a general election looming next year Over on fastFT, Nathalie Thomas says: The deep unpopularity of Mr Hollande, amid weak growth and still high unemployment relative to many of France\u2019s EU peers, has prompted a desperate search among the country\u2019s socialists for an alternative candidate who could possibly be fielded at next year\u2019s elections, with the idea of the incumbent president not seeking a second term becoming more palatable. Most of the 0.2% French growth last quarter was due to companies restocking their inventories, says INSEE. Consumers contributed little to growth, with \u201chousehold consumption expenditure\u201d stagnant for the second month running. Investment picked up, with \u201cgross fixed capital formation\u201d rising by 0.3% France\u2019s trade deficit dragged back growth, says INSEE: Imports sharply bounced back (+2.2% after -1.7%). Exports accelerated to a lesser extent (+0.6% after +0.2%). All in all, foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth (-0.5 points after +0.6 points). But that was balanced by firms replenishing their inventories, which added 0.6% to the growth rate. NEWSFLASH: France\u2019s economy is growing again, but not by as much as economists hoped. French GDP expanded by 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, figures just released by the INSEE statistics office show. That\u2019s an improvement on April to June, when the economy disappointingly shrank by 0.1%. But it\u2019s weaker than expected -- the City was expecting growth of 0.3%. And it\u2019s rather weaker than Britain, which posted 0.5% growth yesterday. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After the excitement of yesterday\u2019s UK GDP report, investors are poised for new growth reports from France and the US. French GDP is released any moment, and will give the first clue on how the eurozone performed in the last quarter. Then at 1.30pm BST, we learn how America\u2019s economy fared in July to September. Economists expect growth to pick up, to an annual rate of 2.5% (from 1.4%). The stronger the reading, the greater the chance of a US interest rate hike before Christmas. A good growth report could also help Hillary Clinton, as the race to the White House reaches its final days. In between, the final estimate of eurozone inflation for October lands at 10am. Royal Bank of Scotland are publishing financial results at 7am, as are airline group IAG. We\u2019ll also be watching the UK car industry, after Nissan\u2019s decision to expand its Sunderland plant despite the uncertainty around Brexit. There may also be ructions in the sovereign bond market too, where prices have been falling for a few weeks now. Expectations of higher inflation are partly to blame, meaning investors are demanding a greater return on government debt. They may also suspect that the era of central bank stimulus may be drawing to an end. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets has the details: UK 10 year gilt yields, pushed up to 1.25% their highest levels since they fell from 1.37% the closing level on the 23rd June, after UK Q3 GDP came in at 0.5%, exceeding market expectations of 0.3%. This economic resilience makes it much less likely that the Bank of England will signal further easing next week at the same time as it publishes its latest quarterly inflation report. German bunds also got caught up in the selloff, with yields hitting their highest levels since May, given the resilience of this week\u2019s German economic data, along with the prospect that inflationary pressures may be starting to build in the broader global economy. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

This decision will be followed by at least two years of negotiations on the terms of EU departure. While two years may suffice to negotiate a successor treaty that will have to be endorsed by European national parliaments and the European parliament, and could face referendums in one or more member states, the process could take much longer.</p> <p>The risks of an inconclusive or detrimental outcome are also material. While some believe the U.K. can arrive at a beneficial agreement with the EU, others take the view that the remaining EU members will have no incentive to accommodate the U.K. Rather, their focus will be on detering other potential departures and containing the rise of their own national eurosceptic movements.</p> <p>In particular, it is not clear if the EU will permit the U.K. access to the single market on existing tariff-free terms, or impose tariffs on U.K. products. Further arrangements regarding the export of services, including by the U.K.\u2019s important financial services industry, are even more uncertain, in our view.</p> <p>Given that curtailing immigration was a major motivating issue for leave voters, it is also uncertain whether the U.K. would agree to a trade deal that requires the country to accept the free movement of labor from the EU. The negotiation process is therefore fraught with potential challenges and vetos, making the outcome unpredictable.</p> <p>We also believe that the divisions, both within the ruling Conservative Party and society as a whole over the European question, may not heal quickly and may hamper government stability and complicate policymaking on economic and other matters.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a64b67309f7f2c0444f9b0e1b8f06fa12cd3c9c5/0_39_1638_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote> <p>In addition, we take the view that the Scottish National Party will push for another referendum on Scottish independence, given that the Scottish population voted overwhelmingly in favor of remaining within the EU. Such a move will have consequences for the U.K.\u2019s constitutional and economic integrity. Northern Ireland is another source of potential issues.</p> <p>These multiple and significant challenges will be very demanding and will detract from macroeconomic goals, such as maintaining growth and consolidating public finances. The lack of clarity while negotiations ensue will also significantly deter private investment. At the same time, we continue to recognize many of the U.K.\u2019s institutional strengths. </p> <p>The U.K. benefits from its flexible and open economy and, in our view, has prospered as an EU member. We believe that the U.K. economy has been able to attract higher inflows of low-cost capital and skilled labor than it would have without the preferential access that EU membership delivers. In our opinion, significant net immigration into the U.K. over the past decade helped its economic performance.

Sam Dumitriu, head of projects at the think tank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nearly 80% of Uber drivers preferred being self-employed and being their own boss, saying in a recent poll that they wouldn\u2019t trade that status for some of the benefits like holiday pay, pension contributions and the National Minimum Wage.</p> <p>Uber drivers typically earn well above the National Living Wage. Across the UK, the average driver earns \u00a316 an hour, that\u2019s after Uber has taken their commission, but before you factor in extra costs like insurance, petrol and car payments. One you factor that in it comes to around \u00a312 an hour, still well above the minimum wage. It\u2019s higher for drivers in London and it\u2019s higher for drivers who work at peak times like Saturday evening.</p> <p>Consumers will see prices rise and a less stable, predictable service. And this doesn\u2019t just hit Uber.

    "webTitle": "RBS reports \u00a3469m loss for the third quarter", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland has been driven deep into the red again by legal costs and a hefty restructuring bill as it enters its ninth year under government ownership. The bailout of the Edinburgh-based bank was announced in October 2008 and \u00a345bn of taxpayer money was eventually pumped into the bank, which has not reported a full-year profit since then. In the first nine months of 2016, RBS made a \u00a32.5bn loss after incurring a \u00a3469m loss in the third quarter. It was profitable in the same three months last year. As Ross McEwan, the chief executive, tried to focus on the \u00a31.3bn of profits generated in the third quarter before the legal and restructuring charges, he said the 73% taxpayer-owned bank faced several hurdles in the months ahead. Among them is the admission that it will fail to meet a deadline to divest 300 branches \u2013 which were to be known as Williams &amp; Glyn. That deadline was imposed by the European Union as a result of its taxpayer bailout. After a number of failed attempts, RBS said full separation and divestment could not now be achieved by the end of 2017. Discussions are under way with the Treasury to discuss how it can spin off the branches. The bank was ordered to get rid of them by the EU as a penalty for its bailout. The inability to dispose of W&amp;G \u2013 a process which has already cost \u00a31.7bn \u2013 is one of the barriers to the government selling off any more of its stake and the bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends. The third quarter was knocked by restructuring costs of \u00a3469m, largely W&amp;G, a \u00a3425m legal bill and a \u00a3300m loss incurred because of changes to tax rules. \u201cWe\u2019ve said that 2015 and 2016 would be noisy as we work through legacy issues and transform this bank for customers,\u201d said McEwan. \u201cThese results reflect that noise. Our core business results were good with a \u00a31.3bn adjusted operating profit, our best quarter since 2014.\u201d In its third-quarter results, RBS warned that it faced a \u201crange of uncertainties\u201d, which included a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the sale of mortgage bonds. The bank said it could face charges and costs that would be so large it could knock its level of capital. RBS said it did not know when it would be able start paying dividends, with McEwan adding that performance targets he set for 2019 would not be met. He is expected to announce in February what measures would be needed to respond to the post-Brexit-vote environment. The bank\u2019s shares initially rose on Friday but fell back to close at 194p, down 1.2% and well below the average price of 502p paid by taxpayers during the bailout. As a result of missing the W&amp;G deadline, McEwan faces the possibility of the EU installing a trustee at end of next year. But he said he did not know what the consequences would be of missing the already extended deadline. RBS had deployed 7,000 staff to work on the divestment but this has now been cut back to 350. The bank has abandoned any hope of a stock market flotation for W&amp;G, bringing that formally to a close this week by redeeming a bond it had sold to a consortium of private equity firms \u2013 and the Church of England. The bond was to convert into W&amp;G shares. A trade sale may be possible as Clydesdale bank said this week it had made an offer for the branches. Small-business owners were angered when RBS did not set aside any money to pay compensation for the poor treatment they claim they received from the bank\u2019s now defunct global restructuring group. A delayed report into the conduct of the division is expected to be published by the Financial Conduct Authority by the end of the year. \u201cRBS continues to mislead the market by not making adequate provisions to meet pending legal challenges,\u201d said James Hayward, chief executive of RGL Management, which was formed to sue RBS over the claims. RBS set aside an unspecified sum to cover a \u00a34bn legal claim from investors in relation to its 2008 cash call. Attempts at mediation have failed and McEwan said: \u201cWe are exploring settlement options. If that fails we\u2019ll be in court in March 2017.\u201d This raises the prospect of former RBS boss Fred Goodwin being called to court.",

      "body": "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland has been driven deep into the red again by legal costs and a hefty restructuring bill as it enters its ninth year under government ownership.</p> <p>The bailout of the Edinburgh-based bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking\">was announced in October 2008</a> and \u00a345bn of taxpayer money was eventually pumped into the bank, which has not reported a full-year profit since then.</p> <p>In the first nine months of 2016, RBS made a \u00a32.5bn loss after incurring a \u00a3469m loss in the third quarter. It was profitable in the same three months last year.</p> <p>As Ross McEwan, the chief executive, tried to focus on the \u00a31.3bn of profits generated in the third quarter before the legal and restructuring charges, he said the 73% taxpayer-owned bank faced several hurdles in the months ahead. </p> <p>Among them is the admission that it will fail to meet a deadline to divest 300 branches \u2013 which were to be known as Williams &amp; Glyn. That deadline was imposed by the European Union as a result of its taxpayer bailout. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/23/rbs-paid-consortium-including-church-of-england-at-least-180m-for-flotation\">After a number of failed attempts</a>, RBS said full separation and divestment could not now be achieved by the end of 2017. </p> <p>Discussions are under way with the Treasury to discuss how it can spin off the branches. The bank was ordered to get rid of them by the EU as a penalty for its bailout. </p> <p>The inability to dispose of W&amp;G \u2013 a process which has already cost \u00a31.7bn \u2013 is one of the barriers to the government selling off any more of its stake and the bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends.</p> <p>The third quarter was knocked by restructuring costs of \u00a3469m, largely W&amp;G, a \u00a3425m legal bill and a \u00a3300m loss incurred because of changes to tax rules.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve said that 2015 and 2016 would be noisy as we work through legacy issues and transform this bank for customers,\u201d said McEwan. \u201cThese results reflect that noise. Our core business results were good with a \u00a31.3bn adjusted operating profit, our best quarter since 2014.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://investors.rbs.com/~/media/Files/R/RBS-IR/results-center/q3-results-2016-announcement-28102016.pdf\">its third-quarter results,</a> RBS warned that it faced a \u201crange of uncertainties\u201d, which included a settlement with the US Department of Justice over the sale of mortgage bonds. The bank said it could face charges and costs that would be so large it could knock its level of capital.</p> <p>RBS said it did not know when it would be able start paying dividends, with McEwan adding that performance targets he set for 2019 would not be met. He is expected to announce in February what measures would be needed to respond to the post-Brexit-vote environment.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s shares initially rose on Friday but fell back to close at 194p, down 1.2% and well below the average price of 502p paid by taxpayers during the bailout. </p> <p>As a result of missing the W&amp;G deadline, McEwan faces the possibility of the EU installing a trustee at end of next year. But he said he did not know what the consequences would be of missing the already extended deadline.<br></p> <p> RBS had deployed 7,000 staff to work on the divestment but this has now been cut back to 350. The bank has abandoned any hope of a stock market flotation for W&amp;G, bringing that formally to a close this week by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/23/rbs-paid-consortium-including-church-of-england-at-least-180m-for-flotation\">redeeming a bond it had sold to a consortium</a> of private equity firms \u2013 and the Church of England. The bond was to convert into W&amp;G shares. </p> <p>A trade sale may be possible as Clydesdale bank <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/25/clydesdale-bank-offer-rbs-royal-bank-scotland-branches\">said this week</a> it had made an offer for the branches.</p> <p>Small-business owners were angered when RBS did not set aside any money to pay compensation for the poor treatment they claim they received from the bank\u2019s now defunct global restructuring group. A delayed report into the conduct of the division is expected to be published by the Financial Conduct Authority by the end of the year. </p> <p>\u201cRBS continues to mislead the market by not making adequate provisions to meet pending legal challenges,\u201d said James Hayward, chief executive of RGL Management, which was formed to sue RBS over the claims.</p> <p>RBS set aside an unspecified sum <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/private-investors-vow-to-take-rbs-to-court-over-125bn-claim\">to cover a \u00a34bn legal claim </a>from investors in relation to its 2008 cash call. Attempts at mediation have failed and McEwan said: \u201cWe are exploring settlement options. If that fails we\u2019ll be in court in March 2017.\u201d This raises the prospect of former RBS boss Fred Goodwin being called to court. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The US economy grew at its fastest rate in two years in the last quarter, due to a surge in exports and improving consumer confidence. The news represented a blow to Donald Trump\u2019s hopes of winning the White House. The US commerce department on Friday reported that gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.9% in the third quarter, up from 1.4% in the second quarter and higher than economists\u2019 expectations of a 2.5% expansion. The figures, the strongest since the third quarter of 2014, are the last official health check on the US economy before the election on 8 November. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has highlighted the weakness of the economy and attacked his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cfailed economic agenda\u201d. In the final presidential debate last week, Trump said GDP was hovering about 1% and falling. He has promised that if elected on his mandate to \u201cmake America great again\u201d, growth will exceed 3%. Despite growth coming in far ahead of that prediction, the Trump campaign said Friday\u2019s figures were \u201cdismal\u201d. \u201cGrowth hasn\u2019t risen above 3% for a full year in any of the Obama presidency,\u201d Dan Kowalski, Trump\u2019s deputy policy director, said in a statement. \u201cDecades of strong economic growth and global leadership have been replaced with low-paying jobs, global chaos and a national debt that has doubled under Obama-Clinton.\u201d Kowalski said Trump\u2019s economic plan would create at least 25m jobs and GDP growth of 4% via tax breaks, renegotiation of trade deals and energy regulation reforms. Barack Obama\u2019s lead economic adviser said the increased GDP figures were due to \u201cstrong export growth and continued strength in consumer spending\u201d. Jason Furman, chairman of the president\u2019s council of economic affairs, said: \u201cExports, which have faced significant headwinds in recent years from slow growth abroad, grew at an annual rate of 10% in the third quarter, their fastest quarterly pace since 2013.\u201d The GDP figures came less than a week before Federal Reserve policymakers will meet to set rates, but economists expect little chance of a rate change so close to the election. Experts expect the Fed to go for a quarter-point rise in December. Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, said: \u201cThis is still another reason why Trump will probably lose. The economy is in decent shape \u2013 so decent that the Fed will have to raise interest rates later this year. \u201cThis report shows a solid economy with \u2013 ironically \u2013 decent export growth. Hillary Clinton simply has to avoid gloating. But this is a big plus for her, and she may get another pleasant surprise when the October jobs report is released next Friday.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A former chief executive of the Co-operative Bank has agreed to a six-year ban from membership of a key accountancy body after admitting to misconduct during his tenure at the top of the troubled bank. Barry Tootell \u2013 who has already been banned from holding senior roles in the City \u2013 will not be able to describe himself as a chartered accountant after his exclusion from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). The Financial Reporting Council, which oversees investigations into misconduct and has made the recommendation to the ICAEW, will receive \u00a320,000 from Tootell to help recoup costs. It is not clear how much the investigation cost. Other bans recommended by the FRC, which had considered a seven-year ban for Tootell, have ranged from three to 10 years. Tootell, who could not immediately be reached for comment, was finance director and then acting chief executive of Co-op Bank for 14 months. He took on the role full-time in September 2012 but was placed on gardening leave in May 2013 after the bank was downgraded to junk status. The bank, then fully owned by the Co-operative Group, later had to be bailed out by hedge funds when a \u00a31.5bn hole appeared in its books in 2013 . Gareth Rees, FRC executive counsel, said: \u201cThe period of exclusion imposed in this case sends a clear message to accountants of the high standards of professional conduct expected of them when undertaking important roles within business. \u201cThe sanction reflects the significance of the misconduct by a CFO [chief financial officer] and CEO of a major UK bank, and the need to promote public and market confidence in the accountancy profession and the quality of corporate reporting in this sector. Mr Tootell engaged in the FRC\u2019s settlement process by accepting his misconduct, which has led to a considerable saving of time and cost.\u201d Tootell was banned by the Bank of England \u2013 along with Keith Alderson, who ran the Co-op\u2019s corporate and business banking division \u2013 in January by its Prudential Regulation Authority. They were not found to have deliberately or recklessly breached the rules and the regulator did not make findings of dishonesty or lack of integrity. The FRC said the Bank of England\u2019s conclusions were \u201cconclusive evidence of misconduct\u201d. The Bank found Tootell contributed to a culture that focused on the short-term financial position (pdf) and did not adequately oversee the corporate loan book that the Co-op took on when it merged with Britannia in 2009. The period of censure covered January 2009 and May 2013. At the height of the Co-op bank\u2019s crisis, the then chancellor George Osborne announced an independent investigation into what went wrong. The review has not yet started as the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s investigation into individuals remains ongoing. The FRC said its investigation into the bank\u2019s auditors, KPMG, was also ongoing. Co-op bank, which reported a \u00a3177m loss for the first six months of the year, said the FRC\u2019s ruling was related to the way it had operated in the past. \u201cWe have said before, the investigations by the regulators into what went wrong at the bank are very important. They indicate the extent of the previous problems at the bank and emphasise that the turnaround is a lengthy and difficult process,\u201d the bank said. \u201cThe findings relate to previous management and the current management team has, over the last three years, progressed the turnaround, having raised additional capital, achieved considerable de-risking, delivered mobile and digital banking capability and strengthened the bank\u2019s appeal to customers.\u201d",

It is not clear how much the investigation cost. Other bans recommended by the FRC, which had <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Publications/Enforcement/Mr-Barry-Tootell-Settlement-Agreement.pdf\">considered a seven-year ban for Tootell</a>, have ranged from three to 10 years.</p> <p>Tootell, who could not immediately be reached for comment, was finance director and then acting chief executive of Co-op Bank for 14 months. He took on the role full-time in September 2012 but was placed on gardening leave in May 2013 after the bank was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/10/cooperative-bank-chief-quits-moodys-downgrade\">downgraded to junk status</a>. The bank, then fully owned by the Co-operative Group, later had to be <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/17/co-operative-bank-stock-market-listing?CMP=twt_gu\">bailed out by hedge funds when a \u00a31.5bn hole appeared in its books in 2013</a> . </p> <p>Gareth Rees, FRC executive counsel, said: \u201cThe period of exclusion imposed in this case sends a clear message to accountants of the high standards of professional conduct expected of them when undertaking important roles within business.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cThe sanction reflects the significance of the misconduct by a CFO [chief financial officer] and CEO of a major UK bank, and the need to promote public and market confidence in the accountancy profession and the quality of corporate reporting in this sector. Mr Tootell engaged in the FRC\u2019s settlement process by accepting his misconduct, which has led to a considerable saving of time and cost.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Tootell was banned by the Bank of England \u2013 along with Keith Alderson, who ran the Co-op\u2019s corporate and business banking division \u2013 in January by its Prudential Regulation Authority. They were not found to have deliberately or recklessly breached the rules and the regulator did not make findings of dishonesty or lack of integrity.</p> <p>The FRC said the Bank of England\u2019s conclusions were \u201cconclusive evidence of misconduct\u201d. <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Documents/supervision/enforcementnotices/en150116a.pdf\">The Bank found Tootell contributed to a culture that focused on the short-term financial position</a> (pdf) and did not adequately oversee the corporate loan book that the Co-op took on when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/21/britannia-cooperative-banks-building-societies\">it </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/21/britannia-cooperative-banks-building-societies\">merged with Britannia in 2009</a>.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s assurances to Nissan that the car industry will remain competitive after Brexit point to a promise that the UK will be staying in the EU customs union, according to Sir Vince Cable. Cable, who was business secretary throughout the coalition government, said this was the most probable rationale as the industry would need assurances there would be no tariff regime and that its supply chain would not be subject to rules of origin checks. If the former Liberal Democrat MP is correct, it would make the job of Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, redundant because membership of the customs union means the UK could not strike its own independent trade deals. It emerged on Thursday that the car industry has been given concrete assurances that it will remain competitive and not be subject to tariffs when the UK leaves the EU, enabling Nissan to announce it planned to build two new models at its Sunderland plant. The government and Nissan have said there was no \u201csweetheart deal\u201d but refused to deny that a written guarantee was offered that gave assurances the company would not be disadvantaged by May\u2019s Brexit policy. Pressed repeatedly on whether there was a letter, No 10 said there were \u201call forms of communications\u201d. Cable told the Guardian: \u201cThe only way these big supply chain companies are going to commit themselves to Britain \u2013 and Nissan is the biggest \u2013 is that if they give them guarantees they are not going to be caught up in rules of origin problems, which is what happens if you leave the customs union. \u201cAnd if you stay in the customs union, which I think is what we\u2019re talking about, what is the role of Dr Fox? Because it means you no longer have an independent trade policy.\u201d He added: \u201cIf you leave a customs union you, by definition, will have tariff regimes and have to validate all the flows of widgets going backwards or forwards. A customs union is not an incredibly big deal and it is not more radical than the single market. Turkey is in a customs union with the EU. But it does mean you can\u2019t go round the world doing separate bilateral deals.\u201d Cable, who lost his seat at the last election, said the only alternative to staying in the customs union would be a specific agreement for the automotive industry, which the EU would be unlikely to want to negotiate. \u201cI am pretty certain the car industry will be operating together. The only alternative to what I have suggested is that they are going to get a separate sectoral agreement for cars. But I cannot see that happening,\u201d Cable added. \u201cWhy would the EU want to do that? The same problems arise for aerospace, for pharmaceuticals. GSK yesterday was worrying about their supply chain. The only way to make the promise stick is to stay in the customs union.\u201d He said the decision taken by May and Greg Clark, the business secretary, to provide such assurances to the car industry would be \u201cvery tricky stuff for the Brexit people because the hardliners want us to leave the customs union as well as the single market\u201d. Cable said: \u201cI was involved in discussions with Nissan in their last big round of investment decisions. Even under the coalition they were toying with doing it in France. I find it impossible to believe they would go ahead without some pretty copper-bottomed promises. These guys do not go making decisions on the basis of vague assurances. That is not the way they operate.\u201d May and Clark are under pressure to reveal the terms of their assurances to Nissan, which were given behind closed doors. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has called on the government to explain fully the deal it has agreed with Nissan. \u201cIt\u2019s welcome that the government have done a deal with Nissan that protects jobs and supports the local community and economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that deal needs to be accompanied by transparency and accountability. We can\u2019t have the government doing deals that affect jobs and the future of our economy without telling the public or parliament what the basic terms are. \u201cThey now need to spell that out and strike a wider deal that gives certainty to businesses, workers and communities across the country.\u201d The prime minister has previously hinted she could be open to at least some sectors staying in the customs union by saying it is not a \u201cbinary choice\u201d and making clear she does not want a hard border between Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland. A further signal came on Thursday from a government business spokeswoman in the Lords. Lady Manzoor said: \u201cIt is possible to be in a customs union and still strike trade deals.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The mayor of London has warned the government that its \u201chard-headed, hard-nosed, hard Brexit approach\u201d is reckless and will cause the loss of millions of jobs, not just in the financial district but across the UK. Sadiq Khan told business leaders that the vote for Brexit did not mean the government needed to choose a route of \u201ceconomic self-sabotage\u201d and urged Theresa May to approach the UK\u2019s departure from the EU with more pragmatism. \u201cIf the proper agreements aren\u2019t negotiated, there will be serious knock-on impacts with jobs and billions of revenue lost \u2013 something that would hit the entire country, not just London,\u201d Khan told a City of London Corporation banquet at the Museum of London on Thursday evening. \u201cMy motivation is not about protecting old City institutions just for the sake of it or presenting a London-centric approach. It\u2019s about protecting our country\u2019s economy \u2013 protecting jobs, promoting growth and safe-guarding prosperity for the next generation,\u201d he said. The mayor expressed concern that the UK could end up without access to the single market \u2013 a so-called hard Brexit that blocks the ease with which British businesses deal with the remaining 27 members of the EU. \u201cIf the government continues with a reckless hard-headed, hard-nosed, hard Brexit approach, and we end up losing access to the single market that helps make our financial services industry a world leader, the impact would ripple out far and wide,\u201d Khan said. Khan spoke alongside Mark Boleat, policy chairman of the City of London Corporation local authority. Boleat acknowledged that it is inevitable that jobs will be lost. \u201cTo the extent that some activities will no longer be able to be conducted from London, there needs to be suitable transition arrangements so that there is not unnecessary harm to employment and the economy generally,\u201d Boleat said. \u201cAnd it is not a question of the number of jobs being lost in the UK being matched by jobs gained elsewhere in the EU 27. It is already apparent that the biggest beneficiary of any job losses in the UK will be New York, and some employment will simply stop as the volume of business can no longer be supported by the higher costs.\u201d Khan also warned that Brexit could actually lead to businesses being more likely to move to New York, Singapore and Hong Kong than to other cities in Europe. Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has also warned that remaining EU members may not catch the fallout from the City. On the 30th anniversary of the \u201cbig bang\u201d \u2013 the measures brought in by Margaret Thatcher to revolutionise the City \u2013 Khan cited figures showing that banking, finance and professional services contributed \u00a3190bn to the UK economy \u2013 almost 12%. \u201cYes, the country voted for Brexit. And of course, that means we\u2019ll be leaving the European Union. But that doesn\u2019t mean unnecessary economic self-sabotage. The government doesn\u2019t have a mandate to jeopardise our economy or the prosperity of millions of people in London and across the country,\u201d said Khan. The London mayor wants the UK to retain access to both the single market \u2013 perhaps with so-called passporting rights \u2013 and also protecting the working rights of EU citizens already working in the City. Financiers have been concerned not just about the deal that will be negotiated once article 50 is triggered but also whether their staff will be welcomed in the UK, particularly after the home secretary, Amber Rudd, raised the idea of companies disclosing the proportion of foreigners that they employ. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has insisted that the issue with immigration is not with \u201chighly skilled and highly paid bankers, brain surgeons, software engineers\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Why Theresa May shared her Brexit fears with Goldman Sachs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "When the Guardian reported this week that Theresa May had privately made a passionate case for Britain\u2019s continued membership of the EU shortly before the referendum, it didn\u2019t look great. The problem wasn\u2019t her opinion: she was saying the sort of things a member of the remain campaign was supposed to. The problem was that she wasn\u2019t doing so in public \u2013 and the audience for her secret pitch was a select group of bankers from Goldman Sachs. May is very far from the first politician to accept such an invitation. She has, for example, put herself in the same category as Hillary Clinton, who between resigning as US secretary of state and running for president made a number of highly lucrative speeches for the same bank. For both politicians, the idea that they are giving off-the-record briefings to the banking industry that stand at odds with their public pronouncements makes for very bad publicity indeed. For the spin doctors at Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, this must have been a pretty good week. That\u2019s not to say that \u201cGoldman\u201d or \u201cGoldmans\u201d \u2013 as insiders call the bank \u2013 is in general enthusiastic about publicity. Much like Fight Club, the first rule of the City is that you do not talk about the City: especially at major banks, unauthorised contact with reporters or researchers is grounds for immediate dismissal. Nowhere is this rule enforced more vigorously than at Goldman. There isn\u2019t even a sign with the bank\u2019s name on at its City HQ. In the absence of a more conventional PR strategy, though, visits from the likes of May and Clinton serve a very useful purpose. Other banks may have good risk management, but none has Goldman\u2019s mystique, or its network of former employees, from the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, to the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and former US Treasury ministers Hank Paulson and Robert Rubin. Goldman loves to present itself as the bank that is better than any of its competitors at drawing the most powerful decision-makers into its orbit \u2013 for example, hiring the former EU leader Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso earlier this year. All of this helps with recruitment as well as with holding on to staff. And so, publicity shy though Goldman may be, the outcry over May\u2019s speech this week makes it look exactly the way it wants to. \u201cAny person being seen as at the global top of what they do, be it in basketball, green technology, fashion or chess, will be an interesting speaker for a bank trying to position itself as the global leader in its own field,\u201d says one insider. Another adds: \u201cIt is the rock-star effect. \u2018Look who we know! Look who we got!\u2019 They say that politics is show business for ugly people. Getting a big-name politician in is just part of that \u2013 a celebrity to cheer up and maybe stimulate very well-paid but hard-pressed employees.\u201d That May was invited to Goldman Sachs and that she accepted, then, is neither surprising nor remarkable, City insiders agree. While her argument may have been more passionately stated behind closed doors, there was technically no gap between what she said at Goldman and her public position at the time and she was not paid \u2013 in line with a generally adhered-to rule that those in office come for free. Though there are other opportunities for political leaders to snuggle up to top bankers, like the World Economic Forum in Davos and conferences such as Bilderberg, building some bridges to Goldman must have felt to May like a smart thing to do \u2013 not least because so many of her recent parliamentary colleagues have ended up with a role in banking as \u201cspecial advisers\u201d: John Major at Credit Suisse, Gordon Brown at Pimco, Alistair Darling at Morgan Stanley, William Hague at Citibank and of course Tony Blair taking a reported \u00a32.5m a year at JP Morgan. She may have had more immediate reasons for moving closer to Goldman, too, and if she made any contacts in the margins of her speech these could actually come in useful amid all the uncertainty over a hard, soft or \u201cdirty\u201d Brexit. In his memoir Back from the Brink, Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer in 2008, recounts how at one point the head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, openly threatened him with no longer buying British sovereign bonds if the government were to introduce a tax on bonuses. Global banks can relocate, and then there is the possibility of a global bank\u2019s chief economist talking down your country. Today\u2019s global mega banks wield immense power and while banks have good reason to lobby governments, politicians have good reason to lobby banks, too. This week, May must have regretted her decision to speak at Goldman, given that the larger public is unlikely to understand that unlike Clinton, who charged an estimated $200,000 per speech, May got nothing. Their audiences appear to have been very different, too. Clinton seems to have spoken mainly to groups of Goldman Sachs clients whom the bank was probably hoping to impress. These are so-called professional asset managers, whose job is to invest the money of pension funds, insurers, rich families or oil-rich countries. Many of them might very well make more than the Goldman Sachs bankers trying to sell them investment products. The term here is \u201cclient entertainment\u201d \u2013 giving your clients something interesting for free in the hope of securing some business later. Recent regulation makes it increasingly hard for banks and brokers to take clients to expensive restaurants, exclusive cultural events or prestigious football, tennis or golf tournaments in exotic locations. But flying out for a speech by a global political celebrity is usually still allowed. In the words of one insider with decades of experience: \u201cBringing in a very expensive speaker is also a way of saying to your clients: \u2018See how much we care for you, that we paid XXX to get this person here! We play in the big leagues.\u201d The same dynamic seems to be at work when global banks bring in a celebrity to speak to their youngest recruits. A young maths student who finished an internship at a big global bank said: \u201cWhen they flew in a famous politician from the other side of the globe just to talk to us interns, you can\u2019t help feeling, well, important. You think, wow, my bank can do this?\u201d All in all, those responsible for crafting Goldman\u2019s image as the world\u2019s most powerful and well-connected bank must have been happy to see this week\u2019s outrage about May\u2019s speech. Could the same be said of those actually in the audience? Goldman\u2019s top brass are paid well over \u00a33m a year, and nearly all of them must make the bank a multiple of that amount in order not to be demoted or \u201cculled\u201d by the end of each year. Based on how much the average senior banker works, \u00a33m breaks down to a little under a thousand pounds an hour. So there they were, sitting in a room listening to May rehearsing the same arguments she had made many times before, positions she was to abandon within days after the referendum. Even worse, May\u2019s speech might very well have contributed to the false sense of complacency in the City over the referendum result. In retrospect, then, attending the speech must now feel to those in the audience like a momentous waste of time. In City jargon: a pretty bad trade.

Getting a big-name politician in is just part of that \u2013 a celebrity to cheer up and maybe stimulate very well-paid but hard-pressed employees.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/5929j\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2836072\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May's private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-580e2c3de4b0c146d58914f8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/24/161024MayGoldman_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/oct/25/theresa-may-private-brexit-warning-speech-to-goldman-sachs-audio\">Theresa May\u2019s private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs \u2013 audio</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>That May was invited to Goldman Sachs and that she accepted, then, is neither surprising nor remarkable, City insiders agree. While her argument may have been more passionately stated behind closed doors, there was technically no gap between what she said at Goldman and her public position at the time and she was not paid \u2013 in line with a generally adhered-to rule that those in office come for free. Though there are other opportunities for political leaders to snuggle up to top bankers, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/22/refugee-crisis-dominates-downbeat-davos-2016\">World Economic Forum in Davos</a> and conferences such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/07/bilderberg-conference-dresden-charlie-skelton-bilderblog\">Bilderberg</a>, building some bridges to Goldman must have felt to May like a smart thing to do \u2013 not least because so many of her recent parliamentary colleagues have ended up with a role in banking as \u201cspecial advisers\u201d: John Major at Credit Suisse, Gordon Brown at Pimco, Alistair Darling at Morgan Stanley, William Hague at Citibank and of course Tony Blair taking a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7186975.stm\">reported \u00a32.5m a year</a> at JP Morgan.</p> <p>She may have had more immediate reasons for moving closer to Goldman, too, and if she made any contacts in the margins of her speech these could actually come in useful amid all the uncertainty over a hard, soft or \u201cdirty\u201d Brexit. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/07/alistair-darling-back-from-brink-review\">memoir Back from the Brink</a>, Darling, the chancellor of the exchequer in 2008, recounts how at one point the head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, openly threatened him with no longer buying British sovereign bonds if the government were to introduce a tax on bonuses. Global banks can relocate, and then there is the possibility of a global bank\u2019s chief economist talking down your country. Today\u2019s global mega banks wield immense power and while banks have good reason to lobby governments, politicians have good reason to lobby banks, too.</p> <p>This week, May must have regretted her decision to speak at Goldman, given that the larger public is unlikely to understand that unlike Clinton, who charged an estimated $200,000 per speech, May got nothing. Their audiences appear to have been very different, too. Clinton seems to have spoken mainly to groups of Goldman Sachs clients whom the bank was probably hoping to impress. These are so-called professional asset managers, whose job is to invest the money of pension funds, insurers, rich families or oil-rich countries. Many of them might very well make more than the Goldman Sachs bankers trying to sell them investment products. The term here is \u201cclient entertainment\u201d \u2013 giving your clients something interesting for free in the hope of securing some business later. Recent regulation makes it increasingly hard for banks and brokers to take clients to expensive restaurants, exclusive cultural events or prestigious football, tennis or golf tournaments in exotic locations. But flying out for a speech by a global political celebrity is usually still allowed. In the words of one insider with decades of experience: \u201cBringing in a very expensive speaker is also a way of saying to your clients: \u2018See how much we care for you, that we paid XXX to get this person here! We play in the big leagues.\u201d</p> <p>The same dynamic seems to be at work when global banks bring in a celebrity to speak to their youngest recruits. A young maths student who finished an internship at a big global bank said: \u201cWhen they flew in a famous politician from the other side of the globe just to talk to us interns, you can\u2019t help feeling, well, important. You think, wow, my bank can do this?\u201d</p> <p>All in all, those responsible for crafting Goldman\u2019s image as the world\u2019s most powerful and well-connected bank must have been happy to see this week\u2019s outrage about May\u2019s speech. Could the same be said of those actually in the audience?</p> <p>Goldman\u2019s top brass are paid well over \u00a33m a year, and nearly all of them must make the bank a multiple of that amount in order not to be demoted or \u201cculled\u201d by the end of each year. Based on how much the average senior banker works, \u00a33m breaks down to a little under a thousand pounds an hour. So there they were, sitting in a room listening to May rehearsing the same arguments she had made many times before, positions she was to abandon within days after the referendum. Even worse, May\u2019s speech might very well have contributed to the false sense of complacency in the City over the referendum result. In retrospect, then, attending the speech must now feel to those in the audience like a momentous waste of time. In City jargon: a pretty bad trade.</p> <p><em>Joris Luyendijk is the author of <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/swimming-with-sharks-406352.html\">Swimming with Sharks: My Journey into the World of the Bankers</a></em></p>",

The test cases have been brought by the GMB union on behalf of two Uber drivers who argue that the cab-hailing firm is breaching the law by failing to provide them with basic employment rights. GMB says they must be paid the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, have paid holidays and the entitlement to rest breaks. Uber has 40,000 drivers in the UK who connect to people looking for a cab via a smartphone app. The US firm says the drivers are independent contractors who are self-employed and can choose where and when they work.

That is not consistent with somebody who is self-employed, it is absolutely consistent with somebody who is a worker.\u201d Bowden rejected the argument that Uber drivers should not be classed as workers because they can choose to switch off the app and not work. He said in reality drivers did not have much choice. \u201cIf you fail to pick up a certain number of journeys and you logged off the app for a period of time, you get put in the so-called \u2018sin bin\u2019.\u201d The test cases will determine the claims of 17 other Uber drivers \u2013 and could have far-reaching consequences for the UK\u2019s growing army of self-employed individuals. Maria Ludkin, GMB\u2019s legal director, said: \u201cThis case represents the first proper legal review of whether jobs in this part of the so-called gig economy really represent a new paradigm of freedom and self-employment, or in fact are simply a new technology ploy to deny employed workers ordinary employment rights and a national minimum wage. \u201cIn our view, Uber\u2019s business model is underpinned by the shaky foundations of worker exploitation and tax avoidance, both of which end up being underwritten by the ordinary taxpayer.\u201d",

BAT is up 42p at \u00a346.53 while Imperial Brands is 21p better at \u00a339.59 after Deutsche Bank raised its price target from \u00a343 to \u00a346. The bank said: Global tobacco may consolidate further with the USA now a theme. Around 27% of Imperial\u2019s 2017 estimated EBITA is generated in the USA. Imperial\u2019s ex-USA growth will be pedestrian; its cash flow generation anything but. The valuation is undemanding; especially so when we consider dividends of around 7% will be paid in the next 16 months [or so]. Bid scenarios incorporating -1% perpetuity growth suggest a valuation between \u00a347 and \u00a351. What may be considered more realistic assumptions as to perpetuity growth dictate valuations considerably higher. We raise our price target to \u00a346 and retain our buy recommendation. On the results front British Airways owner International Airlines Group has climbed 10.8p to 424.3p, despite cutting its forecast for 2016 profit growth from a low double digit percentage to around 7%, due to the fall in the pound and weaker trading in the wake of the Brexit vote. Royal Bank of Scotland has rise 0.5p to 196.9p after better than expected results, while Whitbread has regained some ground following this week\u2019s figures, up 66p to \u00a335.97. But overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 56.10 points to 6930.47, as investors remain cautious despite Thursday\u2019s better than expected UK GDP. The positive data makes another rate cut by the Bank of England next week increasingly unlikely. ITV is down 3.6p at 168.5p as Credit Suisse cut its price target from 240p to 210p but retained its outperform rating. Among the mid-caps, Unite has dropped 22.5p to 559.5p as Morgan Stanley moved its recommendation on the student accommodation specialist from overweight to underweight and cut its price target from 700p to 590p. The bank said the company could be hit by falling student numbers, partly due to the effect of Brexit on overseas entrants: Fundamentals are holding up for now... Unite has so far benefited from a flight to quality as its exposure is skewed towards better quality institutions, which are seeing growth in student numbers. ... but several headwinds could affect student numbers medium to long term: #1: We think that international student numbers could fall as a result of potential stricter visa rules for non-EU students, who make up 25% of Unite\u2019s tenants, and because EU students, which make up 9% of Unite\u2019s tenants, face tuition fee hikes post Brexit vote \u2013 university applications from EU students are already down 9% for the academic year starting Sep 17. #2: Falling affordability for UK students: UK students have formed the majority of the increase in undergraduate student numbers in recent years, and penetration has grown more among the less affluent than the more affluent. Less well off students are likely to face increasing affordability issues: i) maintenance grants have been converted to repayable loans, affecting 20% of students (half of whom see the grant as essential for their studies); ii) tuition fees may rise more from 2017; iii) 77% of recent graduates are worried about their student debt. #3: Risk of oversupply and softening yields: We estimate the current pipeline of purpose built beds equates to about a quarter of existing beds. According to our channel checks, pockets of oversupply are appearing in some markets and demand for secondary assets is softening.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The business secretary has insisted there was \u201cno cheque book\u201d involved in the assurance given to Nissan before the carmaker agreed to keep investing in Britain. Greg Clark reportedly gave a \u201clast-minute written promise\u201d to Nissan to protect the company from the consequences of Brexit, in a pledge that will fuel Labour\u2019s demand for the government to publish any private guarantees. Speaking on BBC1\u2019s Question Time on Thursday night, Clark indicated there had been no offer of financial compensation or state aid. \u201cThere\u2019s no cheque book. I don\u2019t have a cheque book,\u201d he said. \u201cThe important thing is that they know this is a country in which they can have confidence they can invest. That was the assurance and the understanding they had and they have invested their money.\u201d Nissan plans to turn its Sunderland factory into one of the biggest car plants in the world, producing two new models, after gaining \u201csupport and assurances\u201d from Theresa May about the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. The agreement with the government will safeguard the future of more than 7,000 jobs and delivers what will be perceived as a major boost to the economy after the referendum. However, the commitment from Nissan to stay in the UK sparked a political row, with Downing Street forced to deny that it had offered the Japanese company a sweetheart deal. The Guardian understands the government has privately told executives in the car industry that it is confident the sector can retain tariff-free access to the single market. The government and senior executives believe the UK automotive industry is in a strong position when it comes to negotiations about leaving the EU because Britain imports more cars from Europe than it exports. The Nissan announcement was made soon after new figures showed the economy had fared far better than expected in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote. In the first official verdict on how the economy has performed since the referendum on 23 June, the Office for National Statistics said GDP had grown by 0.5% in the third quarter. This was down from 0.7% in the previous three months but well ahead of City forecasts of 0.3%. In a further boost, Toyota, which has a large factory in Derbyshire, also appeared to commit its future to the UK. Didier Leroy, the chief competitive officer and executive vice-president, said Brexit was not a reason to abandon its operations in the country and that he had \u201ctrust in the UK government that it will offer fair treatment\u201d for companies when negotiating its exit from the EU. Nissan has committed to building its new Qashqai and X-Trail models in Sunderland, potentially creating hundreds of jobs. It will be the first time the X-Trail will be made outside Japan. Nissan said it wanted to develop Sunderland into a \u201csuper plant\u201d that would build more than 600,000 cars a year. The future of the Sunderland factory had been in doubt since the referendum. Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, warned that the Japanese company could decide to build its next-generation models outside Britain if it did not receive compensation for any loss to competitiveness it suffered after Brexit. May hailed Nissan\u2019s decision as \u201cfantastic news\u201d and a vote of confidence in the UK. It is the first major investment decision in the automotive industry since the referendum. Although Ghosn said the government had offered support and assurances, Nissan and the government repeatedly refused to say what had been promised and whether any public money was involved, despite pressure from Labour. A source close to Jaguar Land Rover, which employs more than 35,000 people in Britain and is the biggest carmaker in the country, said it was relaxed about Nissan\u2019s deal and had also been \u201creassured\u201d by the government about access to the free market during private discussions. \u201cThe government is fully aware of JLR\u2019s plans. Discussions are taking place,\u201d the source said. Although Downing Street refused to reveal the details of its discussions with Nissan, it signalled that it had not made any declaration to the EU about a proposal to offer state aid. The prime minister\u2019s deputy official spokesman said: \u201cThe assurances are that we will get the best possible deal. There was no special deal for Nissan.\u201d Asked whether Nissan had been promised that it would not face tariffs on its exports to Europe, he added: \u201cI can\u2019t be any clearer. The dialogue we\u2019ve had with Nissan as we do with other companies is a reassurance that we are determined to get the British industrial sector the best possible deal. It is a reassurance. There is no deal. We have a dialogue with Nissan and many other companies.\u201d He declined to comment on whether the industry had been promised lower energy costs, which is another potential financial incentive for Nissan. Industry sources said the government could provide subsidies towards training existing staff and hiring new workers. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said he was pleased there would be continued investment in Sunderland, but said concerns remained about any secret deal between the government and the carmaker. \u201cIf there are any inducements that have been offered, and quite obviously if you are offering big inducements to one industry or one manufacturer, then all the others will quite reasonably say: \u2018Well, what about us?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe are only a few months into Brexit and we don\u2019t know what the terms of the agreement are between Nissan and the government.\u201d May met Ghosn at Downing Street for a private meeting earlier this month while Clark, the business secretary, met company representatives on a recent trip to Japan. In an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One, Clark declined six times to say what support had been offered to the company. \u201cWe have had, obviously, as you might imagine, lots of communication between us, but actually what it rests on is a very strong mutual confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no question of financial compensation over tariffs because we have said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector, and we are going to get the best deal possible. We think that the mutual interest between our European neighbours and ourselves is very strong in this way.\u201d Colin Lawther, senior Nissan official for Europe, told the Guardian that there had been \u201cno financial package outside the normal, in the public domain request, for grant support\u201d. He added: \u201cIt comes down to trust at the end of the day. We are confident the government is taking sufficient measures to make sure the whole of the automotive industry will be competitive at the end of the process.\u201d He said Nissan had stopped production lines at 11am in Sunderland to inform staff of their announcement. One in three British cars are manufactured in Sunderland, where Nissan has invested more than \u00a33.7bn since it opened the factory in 1986. More than 7,000 people are employed at the site, with a further 28,000 supply-chain jobs reliant on the factory, mostly in the north-east. \u201cOur dream is a 600,000-car super plant; there\u2019s not many of those in the world,\u201d Lawther said. The news led to a split in Labour and the trade unions. Union leaders and local MPs such as Iain Wright praised the news while senior Labour figures such as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, criticised the government for a \u201cchaotic\u201d strategy. \u201cWe know nothing about it,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cAre they literally going to decide factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment. We are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more.\u201d The government\u2019s position on the single market has been unclear since May took over as prime minister. She has repeatedly said the UK wants to maintain as much full and free access to the trading bloc as possible. But neither No 10 nor the Treasury has ruled out the possibility that certain industries could face tariffs as a result of a post-Brexit deal with the EU or a reversion to World Trade Organisation rules. David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, confused matters further on Thursday by declaring: \u201cIf we are leaving the EU, we are leaving the single market.\u201d",

Didier Leroy, the chief competitive officer and executive vice-president, said Brexit was not a reason to abandon its operations in the country and that he had \u201ctrust in the UK government that it will offer fair treatment\u201d for companies when negotiating its exit from the EU.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/27/theresa-may-hails-nissans-decision-to-build-new-car-in-uk-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/59gpn\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2846714\"            data-video-name=\"Theresa May hails Nissan's decision to build new car in UK \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5812224ee4b0219a00d394f7\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/10/27/161027mayonnissan_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/10/27/161027mayonnissan.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/10/27/161027mayonnissan_WebM.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2016/oct/27/theresa-may-hails-nissans-decision-to-build-new-car-in-uk-video\">Theresa May hails Nissan\u2019s decision to build new cars in UK \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Nissan has committed to building its new Qashqai and X-Trail models in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/nissan-decision-to-stay-in-sunderland-averts-catastrophic-consequences\">Sunderland</a>, potentially creating hundreds of jobs. It will be the first time the X-Trail will be made outside Japan. Nissan said it wanted to develop Sunderland into a \u201csuper plant\u201d that would build more than 600,000 cars a year.</p> <p>The future of the Sunderland factory had been in doubt since the referendum. Carlos Ghosn, the chief executive of Nissan, warned that the Japanese company could decide to build its next-generation models outside Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/30/nissan-hard-brexit-compensation-new-uk-investment-tariffs\">if it did not receive compensation for any loss to competitiveness it suffered after Brexit</a>.</p> <p>May hailed Nissan\u2019s decision as \u201cfantastic news\u201d and a vote of confidence in the UK. It is the first major investment decision in the automotive industry since the referendum.</p> <p>Although Ghosn said the government had offered support and assurances, Nissan and the government repeatedly refused to say what had been promised and whether any public money was involved, despite pressure from Labour.</p> <p>A source close to Jaguar Land Rover, which employs more than 35,000 people in Britain and is the biggest carmaker in the country, said it was relaxed about Nissan\u2019s deal and had also been \u201creassured\u201d by the government about access to the free market during private discussions. \u201cThe government is fully aware of JLR\u2019s plans. Discussions are taking place,\u201d the source said.<br></p> <p>Although Downing Street refused to reveal the details of its discussions with Nissan, it signalled that it had not made any declaration to the EU about a proposal to offer state aid. The prime minister\u2019s deputy official spokesman said: \u201cThe assurances are that we will get the best possible deal. There was no special deal for Nissan.\u201d</p> <p>Asked whether Nissan had been promised that it would not face tariffs on its exports to Europe, he added: \u201cI can\u2019t be any clearer. The dialogue we\u2019ve had with Nissan as we do with other companies is a reassurance that we are determined to get the British industrial sector the best possible deal. It is a reassurance. There is no deal. We have a dialogue with Nissan and many other companies.\u201d</p> <p>He declined to comment on whether the industry had been promised lower energy costs, which is another potential financial incentive for Nissan. Industry sources said the government could provide subsidies towards training existing staff and hiring new workers.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, said he was pleased there would be continued investment in Sunderland, but said concerns remained about any secret deal between the government and the carmaker.</p> <p>\u201cIf there are any inducements that have been offered, and quite obviously if you are offering big inducements to one industry or one manufacturer, then all the others will quite reasonably say: \u2018Well, what about us?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe are only a few months into Brexit and we don\u2019t know what the terms of the agreement are between Nissan and the government.\u201d</p> <p>May met Ghosn at Downing Street for a private meeting earlier this month while Clark, the business secretary, met company representatives on a recent trip to Japan. In an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One, Clark declined six times to say what support had been offered to the company. \u201cWe have had, obviously, as you might imagine, lots of communication between us, but actually what it rests on is a very strong mutual confidence,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/oct/27/no-10-denies-sweetheart-deal-with-nissan\">No 10 denies 'sweetheart deal' with Nissan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThere is no question of financial compensation over tariffs because we have said that what is necessary is that we are going to maintain the competitiveness of the sector, and we are going to get the best deal possible. We think that the mutual interest between our European neighbours and ourselves is very strong in this way.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Lawther, senior Nissan official for Europe, told the Guardian that there had been \u201cno financial package outside the normal, in the public domain request, for grant support\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt comes down to trust at the end of the day. We are confident the government is taking sufficient measures to make sure the whole of the automotive industry will be competitive at the end of the process.\u201d</p> <p>He said Nissan had stopped production lines at 11am in Sunderland to inform staff of their announcement.</p> <p>One in three British cars are manufactured in Sunderland, where Nissan has invested more than \u00a33.7bn since it opened the factory in 1986. More than 7,000 people are employed at the site, with a further 28,000 supply-chain jobs reliant on the factory, mostly in the north-east.</p> <p>\u201cOur dream is a 600,000-car super plant; there\u2019s not many of those in the world,\u201d Lawther said.</p> <p>The news led to a split in Labour and the trade unions. Union leaders and local MPs such as Iain Wright praised the news while senior Labour figures such as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, criticised the government for a \u201cchaotic\u201d strategy. </p> <p>\u201cWe know nothing about it,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cAre they literally going to decide factory by factory which one gets support? We have to have a comprehensive plan, and this is chaos at the moment. We are trying to get a consensus and heal the divisions the referendum brought and we cannot do that with secret deals behind closed doors. It will divide our country once more.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s position on the single market has been unclear since May took over as prime minister. She has repeatedly said the UK wants to maintain as much full and free access to the trading bloc as possible.</p> <p>But neither No 10 nor the Treasury has ruled out the possibility that certain industries could face tariffs as a result of a post-Brexit deal with the EU or a reversion to World Trade Organisation rules. </p> <p>David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, confused matters further on Thursday by declaring: \u201cIf we are leaving the EU, we are leaving the single market.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",
