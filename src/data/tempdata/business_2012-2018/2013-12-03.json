The US bank would have received nothing if the deal had not gone ahead, the bank revealed to MPs. Members of the Treasury select committee said the investment bank had given \"a green light\" to Co-op'smanagement to do the deal which generated a multimillion pound fee for the US bank. Tim Wise, one of JP Morgan's top bankers, admitted that the Britannia merger had worked out badly but insisted his bank's advice was sound at the time and that he would never be swayed by the prospect of a large fee. However, the committee's chair, Andrew Tyrie, said after the hearing that regulators should scrutinise how investment banks are paid for orchestrating takeovers. \"A fee structure for the provision of independent advice that heavily incentivises one outcome over others strikes me as inherently problematic.

      "bodyText": "Europe's stock markets have closed with losses across the board, pushing the index of leading shares to a three week low, in its biggest daily fall since August. The FTSEurofirst300 index fell 1.4%, driven by selloffs in Frankfurt (DAX down 1.9%), Paris (CAC down 2.65%), Madrid (IBEX down 1.2%) and Milan (FTSE MIB down 2%). London didn't escape, with the FTSE 100 dropping 62 points or 0.95% -- the upbeat construction data may have spared the City from the worst of the gloom. As explained through the day -- the selloff is partly due to speculation that the US Federal Reserve is close to slowing its stimulus programme. Mining stocks have been hit by service sector data from China overnight, which showed slower growth than expected. There is also worry about the weakness of the eurozone economy, says Alastair McCaig, Market Analyst at IG, who explains: Once again the miners are dragging the FTSE lower, although today the retail sector has joined in and added its weight to the top-heavy index. This is certainly a 'risk-off' environment, and the FTSE is falling considerably faster than it did during last week\u2019s meandering drift downward. The disparity between the UK's economic recovery and that of both Spain and France is becoming increasingly obvious, and fears that France might fall back into recession are resurfacing. And that's a good point to end. Thanks, as ever for the comments. See you tomorrow. GW Back in Greece, the appeal court has refused to released Golden Dawn leader Nikos Michaloliakos from custody ahead of his trial over charges of setting up a criminal organization. Kathimerini has more details. Detroit's historic bid to be declared bankrupt has been approved by a US judge today. This thwarts attempts by unions and pension funds to block the city's move, which is likely to lead to heavy cuts. Our Wall Street correspondent, Dominic Rushe, has teh story, Here's his early take: A federal judge announced on Tuesday that Detroit is eligible for bankruptcy protection, the first time in US history that a major city has been declared bust. Judge Stephen Rhodes rejected an attempt by the city's pension funds and unions to have the historic bankruptcy action thrown out. Approving the bankruptcy plan filed by state-appointed emergency financial manager Kevyn Orr in July, Rhodes said: \u201cThe city needs help.\" Rhodes ruled that pension rights could be \u201cimpaired\u201d but warned he would not necessarily approve any final plan with steep cuts. During a nine-day trial, unions and pension funds argued that the Orr had not taken enough time to negotiate with creditors to avoid filing for chapter 9 bankruptcy protection last summer. Orr has calculated the city\u2019s debts at $18bn, a figure disputed by his critics. He had predicted an \"Armageddon-like scenario\" if the petition were rejected. Once the US\u2019s fourth largest city and now its 18th, Detroit\u2019s woes escalated during the recession, as its already battered housing market collapsed and unemployment soared. The city, which had a population of close to 2 million in the 1950s, is now home to around 700,000, more than a third of them living in poverty. UPDATE: Dominic's full story is online here: Detroit granted bankruptcy protection after judge rules in city's favour Andrew Tyrie MP, head of the Treasury committee of parliament, says he is concerned that the bulk (\u00a35m) of JP Morgan's fee for providing advice on the Co-op Bank / Britannia merger in 2008 was only paid if the deal went through. Responding to today's hearing (highlights start here), Tyrie said: A fee structure for the provision of independent advice that heavily incentivises one outcome over others strikes me as inherently problematic. The industry and the regulators will need to look closely at the way such advice is remunerated. Incidentally, in the comments section leicestersq asks for more detail about who conducted the detailed work on Britannia's loan book ahead of the merger (as KPMG said it wasn't them). Sorry for not being clearer earlier -- the answer is that Co-op staff conducted this detailed work (as former CEO told MPs last month) Michael Hewson of CMC Markets sums up the mood in the markets this afternoon: Another negative day on Europe\u2019s markets today as once again stock markets feel the pressure of profit taking from investors who appear keen to lock in some of the gains of the last few months ahead of this week\u2019s key data announcements from the other side of the Atlantic. The recent direction of travel of US data continues to point to an increased probability that we might see a token indication from the Fed that a paring back of asset purchases may come sooner rather than later. This is certainly being reflected in the bond market with 10 year yields approaching 2.8%. While a December taper remains very much an outlier, any cautious portfolio manager would be remarkably imprudent if they didn\u2019t lock in some gains in a month where liquidity traditionally starts to slip back the nearer we get to Christmas. As for the UK and Europe there have also been positive signs from the economic data here as well after UK construction PMI in November blew away expectations while an unexpected drop in Spanish unemployment has raised hopes that maybe the worst of the unemployment in Spain might be in the rear view mirror. On the London market this year\u2019s weakness in mining stocks has continued apace with yet another sharp fall in the sector after UBS cut its price targets for the sector on the back of the recent falls in gold and silver prices. Biggest fallers have been Antofagasta, Randgold Resources and Fresnillo all sliding back reinforcing their positions as the worst performing stocks on the UK index in the last 12 months. The price of gold has fallen to a new five-month low of $1,215.6 per ounce this afternoon. Speculation that the Fed might soon slow its bond-buying programme continues to hit bullion. Yesterday, UBS cut its forecast for the average gold price in 2014 from $1,325/oz to $1,200/oz. European stock markets are down and sliding towards their worst day's trading since mid-August. The selloff is led by hefty losses in France (where every blue chip share is down), followed by Italy and Germany. Traders appear, once again, to be fretting about when the US Federal Reserve might start trimming its $85bn-per-month bond-buying stimulus programme. Solid manufacturing data from America yesterday has made an early tapering look more likely, and there's enough uncertainty around to make trading desks jittery. The political upheaval in Ukraine, where the government won a confidence vote today, is also spooking the European markets. The cost of insuring Kiev's debt against default has rose again today, hitting the highest level since January 2010 according to Reuters data. French CAC: down 84 points at 4,201, -1.95% German DAX: down 134 points at 9,267, -1.4% FTSE 100: down 50 points at 6544, -0.75% Italian FTSE MIB: down 295 points at 18,437, -1.5% Spanish IBEX: down 101 points at 9,644, -1% Shares are also down on Wall Street in early trading, where the Dow Jones has dropped 0.4% or 67 points to 15941. In other eurozone news, Portugal received a thumbs-up from the markets this morning as it successfully exchanged bonds which mature in 2014 and 2015 for longer-dated debt. The offer attracted rather more interest than expected, allowing Portugal to exchange \u20ac6.6bn of debt. That, as fastFT explains here, means Lisbon will be under less pressure to redeem debt next year -- potentially making it easier to exit its bailout programme. The minutes of the Bank of England Financial Policy Committee's latest meeting were released this morning - and show the FPC is keeping a close eye on Britain's housing market. Today's new that construction activity rose at its highest rate since August 2007 suggests the Bank was wise last week to exclude household loans from its Funding For Lending Scheme. Interestingly, the minutes also show that the decision was taken by Governor Mark Carney and chancellor George Osborne; the experts on the FPC were \"informed\" afterwards. That's an alarming sign, says Observer economics editor Heather Stewart: This was the important, headline-grabbing decision, prompted by concerns about the recent strength of house prices, which Carney last week described as, \"taking our foot off the accelerator\"; yet apparently it was initiated not by the committee with the job of seeing off the next bubble \u2013 but in a quiet chat with Osborne. The minutes rightly point out that the FLS is \"operated jointly\" by the Bank and the Treasury; and it may well be the case that it was Carney's idea to \"refocus\" the scheme \u2013 certainly, it seems to go against the grain of the government's Help to Buy Scheme, which is subsidising mortgages for buyers with small deposits. Yet surely if the FPC is to build its public reputation as the guardian of financial stability, and the slayer of boom-and-bust, it should be initiating decisions like these, not simply rubber-stamping deals between Carney and Osborne. More here: How independent is the FPC? Chris Giles of the FT is also concerned: And here's our news story on the minutes, and the signs that the FPC is more worried about the UK housing market. Jill Treanor: Bank of England committee flags up housing market concerns In Athens, riot police reportedly used tear gas against demonstrating school guards who lost their jobs through its public sector job cuts programme. One women was hurt during the protests against Athens' mobility scheme -- which will cut 15,000 state employees by the end of 2014. Several demonstrators was detained by police. Greek newspaper Kathimerini has details: School guards protesting their induction into a cost-cutting civil service mobility scheme on Tuesday clashed briefly with riot police outside the Administrative Reform Ministry on Vassilissis Sofias Avenue in central Athens, prompting the police to use tear gas to disperse a group of about a dozen protesters trying to muscle their way into the building. One woman was lightly injured in the scuffle when she tripped on a sidewalk and banged her head. The protest was also joined by cleaning ladies who have been fired from the ministry. JP Morgan Cazenove's Tim Wise has said the models used to stress-test Co-op bank's merger with Britannia building society in 2008 didn't anticipate the full extent of the recession: Our man watching the action in the Thatcher Room, Sean Farrell, has the details: Wise is appearing with his colleague Conor Hillery -- they are both managing directors for UK investment banking. Apparently the firm's UK arm could field a couple of football teams-worth of investment banking MDs. Plus a few subs..... RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers who were hit by last night's system's failure should check out this Q&amp;A on whether they can get compensation, by Hilary Osborne: RBS IT meltdown \u2013 will I receive compensation? Here's a flavour: I couldn't fill up my car and had to get a taxi. Will I be compensated? You should be. RBS has said it will make sure customers are not out of pocket as a result of the failure. Compensation will be arranged \"on a case-by-case basis\". To make a claim you need to visit a branch or call the bank and explain that you want to reclaim your money. Royal Bank of Scotland's chief executive has admitted that the bank has failed \"for decades\" to get its computer systems right, as he apologised for the collapse of its debit card system yesterday. Ross McEwan, who ran the retail bank until his promotion to CEO this summer, said RBS\"s IT systems were not up to scratch, leading to last night's 'unacceptable' failures. McEwan said: Last night's systems failure was unacceptable. Yesterday was a busy shopping day and far too many of our customers were let down, unable to make purchases and withdraw cash. For decades, RBS failed to invest properly in its systems. We need to put our customers' needs at the centre of all we do. It will take time, but we are investing heavily in building IT systems our customers can rely on. I'm sorry for the inconvenience we caused our customers. We know we have to do better. I will be outlining plans in the New Year for making RBS the bank that our customers and the UK need it to be. This will include an outline of where we intend to invest for the future. The Unite union has suggested that the tens of thousands of job cuts made at RBS in recent years have compounded the problems: Actually, JP Morgan's Co-op fees are bigger than I initially suggested -- it received \u00a37m, with \u00a35m contingent on the Britannia merger being completed. The man who led JP Morgan's team, Tim Wise, insists they did a good job at the time: JP Morgan is now in the hot seat in front of the Treasury committee (live stream) and defending the \u00a35m fee it received for providing its expertise on the Britannia deal. German bank Commerzbank has seen its offices in Frankfurt raided this morning, by officials investigating suspected tax evasion. Commerzbank says the investigation is targeted at employees of a third-party financial service provider, rather than its own staff, and that it is co-operating fully. Over in Shanghai today, prime minister David Cameron has told Chinese leaders that he'd welcome investment from China in the UK's new high-speed rail network, HS2. My colleague Nick Watt writes: In a question-and-answer sessions at Jiao Tong university in Shanghai, the prime minister said he had told the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the premier, Li Keqiang, that Britain had much to learn from the success of China's high-speed rail lines. But Lord Adonis, the former Labour transport secretary and father of theHS2 project, added a note of caution as he said that a former Chinese minister who offered to invest in 2009 is now in jail over the fatal crash near Wenzhou in 2011. Here's Nick's full report: UK would welcome Chinese investment in HS2, says David Cameron The PM has also been meeting Chinese entrepreneurs, and even found time to feature in a \"selfie\". The Treasury committee didn't appear to be making more progress with KPMG over its work with Co-op bank, with chairman Andrew Tyrie saying the auditors are playing a \"very straight bat\" to questions over their performance. Sean has the key points: Full details of today's mining-led selloff, from Nick Fletcher: Mining shares push FTSE 100 lower on US taper fears and China worries Here's Katie Allen's take on this morning's strong construction data: Britain's construction sector has enjoyed its strongest pick-up in business since before the financial crisis plunged the industry deep into recession, according to the latest in a string of upbeat economic reports. House builders were at the forefront of the sector's resurgence as they saw activity grow at the fastest pace for a decade last month, according to the Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI. Civil engineers and commercial construction firms also helped the sector claw back some of the ground lost during its slump and companies across the sector took on more staff as new work flowed in. The survey's headline activity index rose more than expected to 62.6 after 59.4 in October. That marked the seventh month of growth and beat a forecast for a slowdown to 59 in a Reuters poll of economists. House building drives surge in UK construction activity The news of Britain's construction revival has not stopped shares falling further in London. The FTSE 100 is now down 58 points or almost 0.9% at 6540. Mining stocks are leading the fallers, with copper producer Antofagasta sliding 5.5%. Traders are worried about the latest data from China earlier today, showing slower growth in its service sector. David Madden, market analyst at IG, explains: Mineral extractors are suffering today as falling metal prices underline how weak global demand is. A drop in non-manufacturing from China and additional cash injections from the People's Bank of China are worrying signs. The British homebuilders are still offside even though the latest UK construction data smashed estimates, while today's building report vindicates Mark Carney's comments that Funding for Lending needs to be diverted towards small businesses. Senior partners from KPMG are being challenged by MPs in the Thatcher Room over their performance at Co-op Bank's auditors. Warren Mead, Andrew Walker and Jonathan Hurst are being criticised for not sounding the alarm over the Co-op Bank's merger with the Britannia building society in 2008. They insisted that they identified the relevant risk factors to the deal, but declined to say whether they would have done the deal with their own money. My colleague Sean Farrell is tweeting the key points (the hearing is live here). The KPMG team also claim that the Bank's top management did not cause them any particular concern. It's under scrutiny following the scandal involving former chairman Paul Flowers. KPMG are also denying responsibility for not spotting problems at Britannia's loan book, saying they did a solid job - and weren't responsible for checking the commercial loan book. The MPs, though, are concerned that the Co-op board simply wasn't astute enough to understand the risks which KMPG says it flagged up in its due diligence. John Thurso MP suggests the Co-op Board had a nasty case of 'deal-itis' -- too obsessed with the merger to spot the problems within Britannia and the economic downturn. The latest news from the eurozone is less encouraging -- the prices which euro area factories charged for their goods are down 1.4% year-on-year. Lower energy costs were the main factor pushing factory gate prices down. They fell by 0.5% in October compared with September, and were 1.4% lower than in October 2012 -- the lowest annual rate since December 2009. But 'core' producer prices also edged down by 0.1% month-on-month, and were 0.3% lower than a year ago. It suggests some firms are being forced to cut prices to drive demand in the face of stagnant growth, austerity, and record unemployment. This graph shows how UK construction plunged in the recession, and took a second dip last year (the 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction): Back to the UK construction revival, and the news that activity accelerated at a six-year high last month. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight reckons \"a sustainable, robust upturn has now firmly taken root\" in a sector which suffered badly in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Archer reckons that if Britain's builders keep growing, they could help economic growth in this quarter match the 0.8% recorded in Q3. He writes; Evidence that the construction sector is continuing to gain momentum is obviously good news for overall growth prospects, although it needs to be remembered that the sector only accounts for 6.3% of national output. Nevertheless, the survey lifts hopes that the construction sector will help the economy to see further robust GDP growth in the fourth quarter especially as it follows on from a strong manufacturing survey. Heads-up: MPs are now questioning KPMG and JP Morgan over the problems at Co-op Bank (details here). Here's a link to the live video feed. My colleague Sean Farrell is watching.... The pound has jumped half a cent against the US dollar on the back of the strong construction data, hitting $1.641. The jump in construction activity last month (see 9.39am onwards) is the latest sign that the UK economy is on \"something of a charge at the moment\", says Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the currency brokers, World First. Cook added: Forward looking sub components, such as employment and new orders, rose handily combining to see broad growth over the sector. We had feared that this would be a purely residential fuelled expansion, but it seems that while residential is the strongest, commercial and infrastructure spending is also going well. But can it last? Cook again: \u201cThe key to the continuation of this growth will be lead times. Can the construction sector keep up with this new found demand? Will shall see.\u201d The FT reported last week that some of Britain's brick makers will be keeping the kilns running over winter to cope with the rising demand for building materials. The full statement is online here. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, comments: House building lived up to its new-found status as star performer in November with the steepest growth rates in 10 years, with commercial and civil engineering activity holding their ground too. Inevitably, business confidence continued to rise sharply, helping to boost spending across the industry heading into the festive season. More highlights from Markit's report into UK construction: \u2022 output and employment both rose at the sharpest rate since August 2007 \u2022 New work rose at the joint-fastest rate since September 2007 (the month of the run on Northern Rock). All three sections of construction saw a rise in activity, Markit said. Housebuilding led the way with the biggest jump in activity in 10 years. It explained: Construction companies pointed to a steep and accelerated expansion of house building activity in November, with the rate of growth the fastest for ten years. Work on commercial construction projects also increased sharply during the latest survey period, and the rate of expansion was the steepest since September 2007. Civil engineering activity increased at a robust pace that was little- changed from that recorded in October. And here's a graph showing the sub-sector breakdown: Britain's construction sector surged last month, with building firms reporting that activity rose at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis began. The Markit/CIPS PMI - which measures activity across the sector -- surged to 62.6 in November, up from October's 59.4. That's the highest reading since August 2007. Growth in house-building in November was the fastest in 10 years, Markit said. Markit also reported that overall activity rose for the seventh month in a row, with \"sharp increases in new orders and employment:. Under Markit's PMI survey, any reading of 50 or more indicates a rise in activity. That should put a smile on George Osborne's face as he puts the finishing touches to Thursday's Autumn statement. Details and reaction to follow The euro just hit a five-year high against the yen, trading at \u00a5140.03 to \u20ac1. That follows those reports that the Bank of Japan is considering expanding its stimulus programme -- perhaps by buying up even more Japanese sovereign debt to help growth and keep the yen weak. . Here's the original story from yesterday that started the rumours. The parliamentary inquiry into what went so badly wrong at Co-op Bank continue this morning, when the Treasury Committee hears from senior staff at KPMG and JP Morgan, from 10am. JP Morgan advised Co-op during the merger with the Britannia building society in 2008, which caused some of Co-op's \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. KPMG are Co-op's auditors, and also played some role in the merger with Britannia building society (but denies giving Britannia's corporate loan book a clean bill of health). Another dissatisfied customer - Olly Barratt, correspondent at Feature Story - reports that RBS's technical problems may not be over: Heads-up - Italy's prime minister has announced that he'll call a confidence vote on December 11 to confirm whether he still has a majority. Enrico Letta needs to show that he still commands control in the Senate, after supporters of Silvio Berlusconi quit his coalition last month. The vote will take place after Letta's own party, the Democratic Party (PD), choose their new leader. Mattio Renzi, the charismatic Florence mayor, looks like the front runner to lead PD. That should bring more stability to PD, which was traumatised by its failure to win the general election in February (which led to the deadlock broken by Letta's left-right coalition). There's some interesting analysis here from Hugo Dixon, arguing that a Renzi-led PD could rally in the opinion polls, giving him to the power to threaten early elections unless the government gets to grips with its reforms: A pretty weak start to trading in Europe this morning, with the FTSE 100 down 15 points at 6581. The French CAC has dropped 0.5%, while the German DAX is down just 0.1%. There's the usual chatter about the prospects of the US Fed starting to 'taper' its bond-buying programme soon, after decent US manufacturing data yesterday. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets dubs it \"the 'good data is bad data' paradigm\" - that figures showing good economic growth mean there's more danger that the punch bowl of loose monetary policy might not get topped up many more times..... Here's our latest news story on Royal Bank of Scotland's payment system failure, by Angela Monaghan. RBS says sorry for card glitch on Cyber Monday Plenty of angry customers in the comments section, including several who say they're still having problems.... No surprise from Australia's central bank overnight as it left interest rates at a record low of 2.5%. Glenn Stevens, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, struck a rather cautious tone about Australia's economy, saying: There has been an improvement in indicators of household and business sentiment recently, but it is still unclear how persistent this will be. Stevens also said here were \"reasonable prospects\" of a pick-up in global growth next year -- crucial for the country's miners; Their shares fell today on predictions that the US Federal Reserve will start to slow its stimulus programme, which could knock growth. Another stock market high to report -- Japan's Nikkei has hit its highest level since the credit crunch struck. The Nikkei climbed another 0.6% to 15,749 points, the highest close since mid-December 2007. The latest six-year high on the Japanese share index (we had one last week too) was prompted by a sliding yen. It fell on speculation that the Bank of Japan is planning to easy monetary policy again. From Melbourne, IG's Stan Shamu explains: A headline saying the BoJ is working on contingency plans for further economic stimulus set the tone for a weaker yen. Yesterday, BoJ Governor Kuroda also spoke and emphasised that the BoJ will continue to be aggressive until inflation is stable at 2%. That send the yen sliding to a low of \u00a5103.3 against the US dollar -- just what the Tokyo government wants to see as it strives for inflation and growth. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. Is Britain's building sector still booming? We'll get a health check later this morning, with the publication of new construction data for November which will show how it performed last month. The figures, due at 9.30am GMT, are expected to show that construction kept growing (although at a less spirited rate than October). And, crucially, if the industry hired more people. Royal Bank of Scotland, the state-owned bank, is in the news for the wrong reasons again after its bank payment scheme failed last night, leaving millions of customers unable to use their debit cards on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. The Bank has taken to Twitter to apologise: We'll be keeping an eye on the UK government's trade visit to China, as David Cameron tries to build closer ties with Beijing. Ministers are gathering in Bali for a World Trade Organization summit in a last-ditch attempt to agree a global trade deal. Hopes of a breakthrough are slim, though, after WTO members failed to agree a draft deal to rubber-stamp this week. While in Greece, there's still no breakthrough between the Athens government and its lenders ; ministers are refusing to scrap rules protecting people from having their homes repossessed. I'll be tracking all the action through the day....",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England's financial policy committee is a critical part of the new architecture constructed by George Osborne to spot crises brewing in the economy long before the kind of cataclysmic crash Britain experienced in 2008-09. Few people have heard of it, yet the FPC is the body that will have the job of clamping down on mortgage lending \u2013 potentially a hugely controversial decision \u2013 should it believe a housing bubble is starting to inflate. So it's crucial that this new, independent committee, comprising four outside experts, as well as five senior Bank insiders and the chief executives of (new) regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, demonstrate that it can take a robust, rigorous and, crucially, independent approach. Yet Tuesday's note of the proceedings of its latest meeting, while showing that the FPC is keeping a commendably close eye on the health of the housing market, suggest policy is being stitched up between the governor, Mark Carney, and his protector, the chancellor. The governor apparently \"informed the committee,\" that \"HM Treasury and the Bank agreed\", that the funding for lending scheme should be restricted to businesses only, instead of also subsidising mortgages. This was the important, headline-grabbing decision, prompted by concerns about the recent strength of house prices, which Carney last week described as, \"taking our foot off the accelerator\"; yet apparently it was initiated not by the committee with the job of seeing off the next bubble \u2013 but in a quiet chat with Osborne. The minutes rightly point out that the FLS is \"operated jointly\" by the Bank and the Treasury; and it may well be the case that it was Carney's idea to \"refocus\" the scheme \u2013 certainly, it seems to go against the grain of the government's Help to Buy Scheme, which is subsidising mortgages for buyers with small deposits. Yet surely if the FPC is to build its public reputation as the guardian of financial stability, and the slayer of boom-and-bust, it should be initiating decisions like these, not simply rubber-stamping deals between Carney and Osborne. Taxpayers' money is involved in quantitative easing, too, and the chancellor must be consulted on any extension of it; but if the minutes of the much longer-established monetary policy committee showed that Carney had \"informed the committee\" that he'd agreed with the Treasury that a fresh bout of QE was in order, anyone who cherishes the Bank's independence would be justifiably outraged. It may well be that the initiative came from inside the Bank; but the appearance of independence can sometimes be as important as the reality, particularly where fledgling bodies like the FPC are concerned. In the early days of the MPC, the feistier members had to fight to make their voices heard against what many felt was the stifling control of the then-governor. Today's FPC members may have to be just as vigilant against the threat of a Treasury takeover.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The boss of RBS has admitted the bank would have to put right decades of underinvestment in its computer systems that have led to embarrassing IT failures barring customers from accessing their accounts. As one City analyst suggested the problems would cost the state-owned bank as much as \u00a31bn to put right, the chief executive, Ross McEwan, apologised for the \"unacceptable\" technical faults. Despite assurances from the bank that the latest problems had been resolved, customers were still reporting problems on Tuesday following Monday's glitch, which saw millions unable to pay by card or withdraw cash on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. The bank said that more than 1,000 branches would open earlyWednesday morning to help customers affected by the faults. McEwan said: \"Monday night's systems failure was unacceptable. It was a busy shopping day and far too many of our customers were let down. \"For decades, RBS failed to invest properly in its systems. We need to put our customers' needs at the centre of all we do. It will take time, but we are investing heavily in building IT systems our customers can rely on. We know we have to do better.\" McEwan said he would be announcing plans to improve RBS in the new year, including an outline of how the bank intends to invest in the future. After RBS bought NatWest in 2000 it was lauded for making huge cost savings from combining the two banks' IT systems, but lack of investment has come back to haunt it. Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec, said: \"Ross McEwan isn't the first RBS leader to acknowledge there had been an extended period of underinvestment going all the way back to the NatWest deal. I don't think it's wildly inaccurate to imagine RBS spending \u00a31bn over a period of time to put things right, but that isn't a number you will see in any given period.\" Union leaders have claimed cost cutting was to blame for the faults on Monday evening and called on the bank to halt its redundancy programme. Unite, Britain's biggest union, said the 30,000 job losses announced by the bailed-out bank since 2008 and the offshoring of IT functions had left it unable to provide a proper service to customers. Dominic Hook, Unite national officer, said: \"It is unacceptable that the bank's customers are once again facing inconvenience. Unite has grave concerns that staffing challenges are exacerbating the problems facing the bank, challenges that could be further amplified when the chief executive announces the outcomes of his strategic review in February. \"Serious questions must be asked as to why constant job cuts are being made when there are clearly serious issues which need addressing by management.\" Earlier on Tuesday RBS took to Twitter to apologise to furious customers, promising to compensate those left out of pocket as a result of the failure at RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank, which mainly affected customers between 6.30pm and 9.30pm on Monday. There were reports of trolleys full of shopping abandoned in supermarkets and people unable to pay for their petrol as the bank's customers were unable to withdraw cash and debit cards were declined. Others found that their accounts were overdrawn when there should have been funds available. Typically, about 250,000 RBS customers will use a cash machine every hour. RBS said it would not be compensating customers for inconvenience or time wasted, focusing instead on those who had incurred costs. The bank insisted the issues affecting customers on Monday had been resolved, while conceding that some customers were still having difficulties. A spokesman said: \"The system issues that affected our customers last night have now been resolved and the vast majority of customers are experiencing a good service. We have heard from some customers who are still experiencing problems as our processes and systems get back to a fully normal service. If any customer is experiencing issues they should get in touch with our call centres or come into our branches, where our staff will be ready to help.\" Susan Allen, director of customer solutions at RBS, said it was still unclear exactly what went wrong. \"We put all our focus on getting it fixed and we now start the detailed work on what went wrong. It is completely unacceptable that customers couldn't access their own money,\" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"The investigations would suggest it is completely unrelated to the volumes on Cyber Monday.\" Allen insisted the bank would \"put this right for customers\".Some customers were angry about the lack of communication. One Guardian reader, petey123, wrote: \"So nothing on their website or by email about this, until I find out on the Guardian why my card wasn't working. Oh, but you put it on twitter. great.\" The failure is a huge embarrassment for RBS, following similar glitches 18 months ago when IT problems locked many customers out of their accounts for several days. It cost the bank \u00a3175m to fix the problem and pay compensation to the customers affected. Stephen Hester, RBS chief executive at the time, waived a bonus potentially worth more than \u00a32m as a result of the disruption in June last year. It comes at a low point for RBS amid allegations that it is deliberately wrecking viable small businesses to boost profits. City regulators and the bank are investigating the allegations. Data security company Check Point warned RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers to be wary of phishing emails sent to trick them into revealing their full bank details. Check Point's UK managing director Keith Bird said: \"Bank customers need to be very careful not to click on links in emails which appear to come from RBS, Nat West or Ulster Bank advising them about changes to account security, no matter how authentic the email seems to be.\"",

The news came as it announced a 7% fall in first half profits to $70.5m. Julian Yates at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> The focus will be on the upped 2014 estimated revenue guidance. First half results showed 2.4% growth which implies very decent second half growth if the top end of guidance is to be met. At the divisional level however, core COBOL licences declined 9% which was surprising, offset by the long waited growth in Test licences and growth in the acquired COBRA division. Given no commentary, we assume no upside on EBITDA margins, meaning any overall upgrades are likely to be modest. <br> </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Real Good Food</strong>, the sugar and baking business, has fallen nearly 15% to 58.5p after a 5.6% fall in half year revenues to \u00a3130.1m and a decline in earnings from \u00a33m to \u00a32.2m. The profit drop is mainly due to the group investing in brand development and opening a sales office in Brussels. Revenues fell after lower sugar volumes over the last year.</p> <p>Ahead of the important festive season, chairman Pieter Tott\u00e9 remained upbeat:</p> <blockquote> Once again we approach the key Christmas trading period with the group well placed to benefit from the traditional seasonal boost in sales, and I am pleased with the continued progress we are making in re-shaping the group. <br> In Napier Brown we face a significant challenge over the coming months, following the well publicised dramatic drop in EU sugar market prices as we bring our buying book in line with this correction in market prices.  Meanwhile, however, Napier Brown's sales volumes, in both the industrial and retail markets have increased significantly from the start of the new contract season in October 2013. We anticipate our Whitworths sugar brand achieving a consumer sales value of more than \u00a3100m over the next 12 months. </blockquote> <p>Analyst Phil Carroll at the company's broker Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Napier Brown has seen a sharp drop in EU sugar prices which will put some short-term pressure on margins. At this point there remains some uncertainty on the input price as this remains subject to contract negotiations but the group are hopeful it can bring its buying book in line with the sharp correction in market prices which are down around 20% year on year. <br> The highlight of Napier's performance is the successful reinvigoration of the Whitworths brand, which has been extremely well received and will be reflected in significantly increased volumes from October onwards especially in retail at Asda and Booker. Also in relation to this division, we note the new sugar hub at Immingham, which will help enable cost effective imports of sugar, is due to be commissioned in January. This is a key element of management's growth strategy for the division in the future.  Renshaw has seen the hot summer dampen demand for home-baking products leaving sales flat but more positively its margins have seen some mix benefit. Profitability is down year on year but this is partly due to continued investment in the division's commercial team and branded initiatives.  In terms of our full year forecasts, we have taken a prudent stance and reduced our pretax profit forecast for 2014 by \u00a30.9m or 13% to \u00a36.3m, reflecting some pressure on margins and the increased costs in servicing higher sugar volumes. This translates into a 13% reduction at the earnings level to 6.6p. In order to be prudent, we have also reduced our 2015 estimates too reflecting the lower starting base with pretax profit reducing by \u00a30.5m or 6% to \u00a37.7m and earnings per share also by 6% to 8.2p. So post our forecasts update, Real Good Food shares trade on a 2014 PE of 10.4 times and an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 6.5 times. We highlight these metrics fall quite markedly in 2015 to 8.4 times and 6.1 times respectively. </blockquote>",

We anticipate our Whitworths sugar brand achieving a consumer sales value of more than \u00a3100m over the next 12 months. Analyst Phil Carroll at the company's broker Shore Capital said: Napier Brown has seen a sharp drop in EU sugar prices which will put some short-term pressure on margins. At this point there remains some uncertainty on the input price as this remains subject to contract negotiations but the group are hopeful it can bring its buying book in line with the sharp correction in market prices which are down around 20% year on year. The highlight of Napier's performance is the successful reinvigoration of the Whitworths brand, which has been extremely well received and will be reflected in significantly increased volumes from October onwards especially in retail at Asda and Booker. Also in relation to this division, we note the new sugar hub at Immingham, which will help enable cost effective imports of sugar, is due to be commissioned in January. This is a key element of management's growth strategy for the division in the future. Renshaw has seen the hot summer dampen demand for home-baking products leaving sales flat but more positively its margins have seen some mix benefit. Profitability is down year on year but this is partly due to continued investment in the division's commercial team and branded initiatives. In terms of our full year forecasts, we have taken a prudent stance and reduced our pretax profit forecast for 2014 by \u00a30.9m or 13% to \u00a36.3m, reflecting some pressure on margins and the increased costs in servicing higher sugar volumes. This translates into a 13% reduction at the earnings level to 6.6p. In order to be prudent, we have also reduced our 2015 estimates too reflecting the lower starting base with pretax profit reducing by \u00a30.5m or 6% to \u00a37.7m and earnings per share also by 6% to 8.2p. So post our forecasts update, Real Good Food shares trade on a 2014 PE of 10.4 times and an enterprise value/EBITDA ratio of 6.5 times. We highlight these metrics fall quite markedly in 2015 to 8.4 times and 6.1 times respectively.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's construction sector has enjoyed its strongest pick-up in business since before the financial crisis plunged the industry deep into recession, according to the latest in a string of upbeat economic reports. House builders were at the forefront of the sector's resurgence as they saw activity grow at the fastest pace for a decade last month, according to the Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI. Civil engineers and commercial construction firms also helped the sector claw back some of the ground lost during its slump and companies across the sector took on more staff as new work flowed in. The survey's headline activity index rose more than expected to 62.6 after 59.4 in October. That marked the seventh month of growth and beat a forecast for a slowdown to 59 in a Reuters poll of economists. \"Construction activity continues to spring back to life during the final months of 2013,\" said Tim Moore, senior economist at survey compilers Markit. \"That said, construction growth is still coming from a low base as output levels rebound from a deep and protracted double-dip recession that only really ended this summer.\" While economists and policymakers will want to see the survey's rosy picture confirmed in official data in coming months, it is a welcome boost to chancellor George Osborne as he prepares to present his autumn statement plans for growth, spending and taxes on Thursday. The construction report follows a much stronger than expected Markit survey on Monday from the manufacturing sector, which makes up around a tenth of the UK economy. That poll suggested new orders were growing at the fastest pace for 20 years and that manufacturers were creating 5,000 new jobs a month. In the smaller construction sector, there were also multi-year highs for key measures. Output, employment and new work all rose at their fastest pace since 2007. Anecdotal evidence from the survey, which is sent to some 170 construction companies, suggested business was being helped by rising confidence in the economic outlook and improving credit conditions. Confidence among builders about the business outlook was the highest for four years. Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight commented: \"The construction sector does now seem to be enjoying decent, and increasingly broad-based, recovery following extended, deep weakness. \"Of critical importance to the construction sector going forward is that the economy holds up well over the coming months and that housing market activity sees sustained healthy (but not excessive) growth. The first stage of the government's Help to Buy initiative has been particularly welcome for housebuilders.\" Housebuilders say the government's scheme to kickstart the housing market has helped bring in more first-time buyers. But there have been warnings that it risks creating a bubble and last week the Bank of England reined in its own mortgage lending incentive scheme.",

    "webTitle": "NatWest and RBS cards declined on Cyber Monday due to IT meltdown", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A technological banking glitch on one of the busiest online shopping days of the year left millions of shoppers unable to pay for transactions using their credit or debit cards. Customers of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) group, which includes NatWest and the Ulster Bank, found that their payments were declined, while others could not access the banks' websites or smartphone apps. Last night the banks were grappling with a new and potentially shattering blow to their brand reputation and growing customer anger after similar glitches 18 months ago when IT problems locked many customers out of their accounts for several days. The cause of the chaos is unclear, with speculation ranging from suggestions of a cyber attack to a repeat of the previous problem. The latest fiasco, which comes after another similar event in March lasting a number of hours, follows an admission by the new RBS chief executive that the reputation of the bailed-out institution had been seriously damaged by allegations that it was deliberately wrecking small businesses in pursuit of profit. Initial reports yesterday that transactions were being declined en masse began to filter through at around 6.30pm, one of the busiest times of the day for shoppers stocking up on groceries or filling their cars at pumps. Social media was awash with customers complaining of being left high and dry for a number of hours, and warning that the problems were the final straw. \"Im leaving you #natwest I've had enough of this disfunctional relationship @natwest_help,\" tweeted one. Another tweeted that the problems had ruined her plans to take advantage of reductions available at many online retailers on one of the busiest online shopping days of the year: \"And there goes my plan to get some Xmas shopping bargains online tonight. No #CyberMonday for me. #RBS is ruining Christmas.\" Another Twitter user, Deborah Turner, said: \"My autistic son is seriously stressed as card not working in shops or machines, doing my best to help him by phone #natwest\". NatWest's press office appeared to be as much in the dark about the cause of the problem as any of their customers, referring early evening queries to the bank's Twitter account and releasing a two-sentence statement pointing out that it was aware of \"technical issues\" and apologising to customers. Shortly before midnight, it released a new statement pledging to compensate customers who had been \"left out of pocket\" as a result of the problems. It said: \"We are very sorry for the system issues that affected our customers this evening. Our customers are reporting that services are coming back on line. We will confirm when all systems have returned to normal service. \"If customers have been left out of pocket as a result of these system problems, we will put this right. If any customer is unable to resolve an issue caused by the disruption, they should get in touch with our call centres or come into a branch in the morning where our staff will be ready to help.\" Last year, when systems affected more than 16 million account holders at RBS and NatWest, Ulster Bank customers were left without access to their bank accounts for a week. Ulster Bank directors did not take their bonuses for last year as a result, although there was no such gesture in the case of their colleagues at RBS and NatWest. Reports have suggested that bankers at the group are set to claim \u00a3500m in bonuses this year, although pressure for them not to do so is expect to mount in the wake of yesterday's chaos. It took place towards the end of a day when some hundreds of millions of pounds were expected to have been spent online as the Christmas shopping season took off. Retailers hope that that the Mega Monday online shopping spree will mark the start of a Christmas rush after industry figures showed disappointing sales in November. Predictions that as much as \u00a3450m would have gushed through online tills \u2013 making it Britain's busiest day on record for cyber-shopping \u2013 have brought comfort to retailers after last month saw sales growth drop to its slowest pace for seven months. Other reports suggested the make-or-break month for retailers had got off to a strong start. Visa Europe estimated that \u00a3450m would have been spent online in 7.7m transactions by the close of business on Monday night, which would make this Mega Monday the busiest online shopping day recorded. Mega Monday is one of many days retailers seek to highlight in the runup to Christmas. It marks the day when shoppers have just been paid for November and, having supposedly spent the weekend browsing, they then splash out online \u2013 allowing plenty of time for deliveries in time for Christmas. Retailers mark the day with offers and discounts, following hard on the heels of American import Black Friday \u2013 the day US retailers offer post- Thanksgiving discounts. In a sign cash-strapped shoppers were putting off festive food buying and holding out for pre-Christmas discounts on gifts, the British Retail Consortium said November's sales were up just 0.6% on a year earlier once the effect of new store space was stripped out of the figures. It was the weakest performance since takings slumped amid a cold snap in April. Demand for winter and party wear helped sell clothes and a more buoyant housing market saw homewares fare better, but food sales fell for the fourth month running according to the BRC's sales monitor, compiled with accountants KPMG. There was \"good demand\" for festive desserts, party food and Christmas hampers and the \"baking frenzy\" continued, the report said. But consumer confidence weakened and, coupled with falling food prices, knocked sales for the category overall. \"It seems that once again, shoppers are leaving their festive food buying until later. Six in 10 tell us they will spend more time than last year hunting for the best deals, and four in 10 seeking the best quality,\" said Joanne Denney-Finch, chief executive of grocery researcher IGD, which provides the report's food data. Overall, sales growth was ahead of where it was in the runup to Christmas 2012, when November sales rose just 0.4% on the year. The BRC said this November saw a slow start and then growth \"picked up in a big way\" in the final week, when falling temperatures helped boost clothing sales. Helen Dickinson, BRC director general, said: \"Christmas spending looks on course to be an improvement on last year, but December will decide it.\".",

The bank said:</p> <blockquote> The UBS precious metals commodity team has revised down 2014 and 2015 gold and silver prices, seeing few positive catalysts medium-term, with QE-tapering to start in January, gold struggling to attract the safe-haven bid, and physical buying having limits <br>We still prefer companies with low unit costs, good capital discipline and strong cash flow growth, with Rio and BHP our top picks.

      "bodyText": "Mining shares are among the day's early losers, as metal prices continue to fall and UBS issues a downbeat note. Antofagasta has fallen 21.5p to 759p, Fresnillo is down 13.5p at 746.5p while Randgold Resources has lost 97p to \u00a340.60. The prospect of the US Federal Reserve beginning to slow its $85bn a month bond buying programme earlier than expected was raised by better than expected American manufacturing figures on Monday. That in turn has hit markets in general, and metal prices in particular. The sector's performance has not been helped by disappointing service sector figures from China, a key consumer of commodities. As for UBS, it has cut its target price for Antofagasta from 870p to 845p with a neutral rating and edged down Fresnillo from \u00a311.50 to \u00a311 albeit with a buy rating. The bank said: The UBS precious metals commodity team has revised down 2014 and 2015 gold and silver prices, seeing few positive catalysts medium-term, with QE-tapering to start in January, gold struggling to attract the safe-haven bid, and physical buying having limits We still prefer companies with low unit costs, good capital discipline and strong cash flow growth, with Rio and BHP our top picks.

      "bodyText": "Retailers are hoping that the Mega Monday online shopping spree marked the start of a Christmas rush after industry figures showed disappointing sales in November. Predictions that as much as \u00a3450m would have gushed through online tills \u2013 making it Britain's busiest day on record for cyber-shopping \u2013 have brought comfort to retailers after last month saw sales growth drop to its slowest pace for seven months.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Self-employed workers have suffered a severe drop in income since 2008, according to an independent study that shows people working for themselves have fared worse than those in full-time employment. Incomes have been declining for middle and lower earners among the self-employed since the turn of the century and are now down nearly a third over the 12 years, with the situation worsening since the financial crash. At the same time there has been a significant rise in the number of people registering as self-employed, according to the report. Richard Murphy, a tax expert and author of the report, said the study showed the self-employed have suffered \"a serious fall in their real income both individually and as a group over the last 12 years, especially when inflation is taken into account\". Those at the top of the income scale on more than \u00a3150,000 have fared better and increased their incomes significantly over the same period, while those on incomes below \u00a3100,000 have lost out. Murphy, whose report for Tax Research is funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, said self-employed workers who earned above \u00a32,000 but less than \u00a3100,000 had lost 31% of their income over the past 12 years. According to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and HMRC earnings fell from an average \u00a315,000 to just under \u00a310,400, in 2011 prices. The total amount of self -employed workers' income as a proportion of GDP has also tumbled from almost 11% to nearer 8.5% of GDP, despite a rise in the number of people in the sector. Murphy said: \"The claim that unemployment is being beaten as a result of increasing numbers of self-employed people \u2013 with it being suggested by the ONS in 2013 that 400,000 or more people have entered self-employment since the economic crisis began \u2013 is not necessarily good news for those actually undertaking that activity. They can expect modest and maybe falling return on their effort from doing so. \"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that many of these in supposed self-employment will in fact be little more than disguised unemployed.\" John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, said the growth in self-employment was less about a boom in entrepreneurs and more a haven for low-paid workers. He said: \"Since the recession the ranks of the self-employed have been swelled by unskilled 'odd jobbers', unable to find jobs as employees and picking up whatever scraps of low paid casual work are available. A surge in self-employment accompanied by falling self-employed income is a sign of economic desperation rather than a newly vibrant enterprise culture.\"",
