A high court judge has ruled that a landmark trial into Barclays' role in rigging the London interbank lending rate (Libor) must go ahead, with the bank's bosses, including Diamond, called into the witness box. \"There is obviously a question as to what Mr Diamond knew [about Libor-rigging] and when he knew it,\" Mr Justice Flaux said during a preliminary hearing into the case at the high court.

Barclays has agreed to pay \u00a3290m of fines to US and British authorities over its role in the manipulation of Libor and other key interest rates.

      "bodyText": "Consumers in the UK took on \u00a31.7bn of debt in September, including the biggest surge in unsecured borrowing in more than four-and-a-half years. The boost to lending on credit cards, overdrafts and personal loans, which totalled almost three times the average of the previous six months, was welcomed by some analysts as a sign that consumers are rebuilding their battered confidence on a stable unemployment rate and fall in inflation. This optimistic view was offset by concerns from others that a run of below-average wage rises has forced low and middle income households to increasingly rely on debt in the runup to Christmas. Wage rises running below the rate of inflation and a switch in emphasis across commercial and industrial employers to part-time working have pushed down household incomes and increased the pressure to apply for short-term loans, some economists said. Figures from the Bank of England showed that individuals took on \u00a30.9bn of borrowing during September \u2013 a marked change from the summer when borrowing remained static in June and July and net repayments totalled \u00a3163m in August. When \u00a30.3bn of spending on credit cards is added in, new unsecured borrowing amounted to \u00a31.2bn \u2013 the sharpest rise since February 2008. The figures follow positive retail sales data for the month, which showed a 0.6% increase in volumes, and news that the UK came out of recession in the third quarter of 2012. A \u00a30.5bn rise in mortgage lending boosted the figures. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, warned against reading too much into one month's data, but said it could be an early sign that consumers were becoming more confident about spending. \"The marked rise in consumer credit in September is potentially notable as consumers' appetite for taking on new borrowing has been limited for some considerable time, while there has also been an ongoing strong desire of many consumers to reduce their debt,\" he said. \"If consumers are becoming more prepared to spend \u2013 helped by recent healthy employment growth, lower overall inflation and an edging up in earnings growth from the lows seen earlier in 2012 \u2013 then there is a real chance the economy can continue to grow following the third-quarter rebound in GDP.\" But researchers Capital Economics argued the figures revealed the weak state of consumption and should ring alarm bells. \"The prominence of growth in consumer credit suggests that it may reflect households seeking to maintain spending in the face of continued declines in real earnings.

He denied that his massive liquidity schemes and promise of unlimited bond purchases would fuel inflation.</p> <p>Draghi also rejected claims that the European Central Bank has violated its mandate, and argued that German savers should be pleased, not alarmed \u2013 taxpayers might even make a profit on the ECB's bond purchases.</p> <p>A full transcript of the interview was <a href=\"http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2012/html/sp121029.en.html\">uploaded to the ECB's website this morning</a>. It begins with Spiegel inquiring whether the ex-Goldmanite has any savings (!) before giving Draghi a vigorous grilling.</p> <p>Here are some highlights.</p> <p>On sovereignty:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has proposed giving the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs a direct say in national budgets. What do you think of that proposal?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I am fully in favour of it. Governments would be wise to seriously consider it. I firmly believe that, in order to restore confidence in the euro area, countries need to transfer part of their sovereignty to the European level.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> But it is precisely that that many governments are unwilling to do. Why are they so against it?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> A lot of governments have yet to realise that they lost their national sovereignty a long time ago. Because, in the past, they have allowed their debt to pile up, they now need the goodwill of the financial markets. That sounds like a paradox, but it is nonetheless true: it is only once the euro area countries are willing to share sovereignty at the European level that they will gain sovereignty.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on German fears:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> In Germany, people have several reservations about your crisis policies. Were you surprised to receive so much criticism?</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> I had the opportunity of a very deep and wide-ranging exchange of views with members of the Bundestag last Wednesday. My impression was that I was able to explain a number of issues, in particular how the measures comply with our mandate to safeguard our independence and to ensure price stability in the medium term.</p> <p><strong>SPIEGEL:</strong> This fear stems from historical experience. Germans have learnt that, if central banks flood the markets with money, this always leads to inflation.</p> <p><strong>Draghi:</strong> We have to take these fears very seriously. But the correlation is not so simple. In some cases, such as in the Weimar Republic, printing money caused inflation. But in other cases, proactive central bank action did not.</p> </blockquote> <p>Draghi is clearly keen to assuage German concerns \u2013 last Wednesday he spent two hours at the Bundestag answering MPs questions. <em>Preparing the ground before Angela Merkel seeks parliamentary approval for new support for Greece, Spain and/or Cyprus, perhaps....</em></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And with that, we end for the night, with the European markets closed. Trading was suspended today on Wall Street due to Hurricane Sandy and all indications are it will be shut again on Tuesday. Tomorrow should be an interesting day - with Spanish third-quarter GDP and German unemployment data being released. The Bank of Japan is also holding its monthly policy meeting -- will fears over the economic climate prompt another stimulus plan? Mario Monti could be in the news again -- the Italian prime minister is speaking at the \"World Economic Forum\" in Rome. We'll also be tracking Greece again, as the deadlock over its austerity measures continues. Until then, thanks for reading and goodnight! More on the Bank of Spain announcement from our Madrid correspondent Giles Tremlett: Spain's \"bad bank\" will be known as Sareb. It estimates that it will take \u20ac45bn of toxic real estate from Bankia and three other nationalised banks, with a second group of banks that also need bailout money to provide more. \"Under no circumstances... will it exceed \u20ac90 billion,\" the Bank of Spain says. Banks will have to take a haircut on the market value. The Bank of Spain explains like this: \"The transfer value, taking into account the... haircuts, is very conservative. On average, it is estimated to represent a discount of approximately 63% on the gross book value of foreclosed assets. By asset type, the discount is 79.5% for land; 63.2% for unfinished developments and 54.2% for finished housing. The average discount in the case of loans to developers is 45.6%, including haircuts of 32.4% for finished projects and 53.6% for loans to finance urban land.\" It adds: \"This transfer value does not determine, therefore, the economic value of the assets linked to the real estate sector held by Spanish banks on their balance sheets. It has been further reduced by taking into account the above-mentioned adverse impact of valuations arising specifically from the transfer of the assets to Sareb.\" Bank of Spain deputy governor Fernando Restoy is obviously worried about sending house prices - which are only 25 percent off peak around the country - from plummeting. The price paid by the \"bad bank\", he said, must not be taken as the market value. Santander, BBVA and others who must now compete to sell their stock of toxic properties with the \"bad bank\" are unlikely to be happy. The Bank of Spain, just to highlight how serious the housing crash was in the country, has said Spanish lenders will transfer real estate assets into the country's \"bad bank\" at discounts of up to 80%. Property loans will be moved at an average discount of 46%, with foreclosed assets passed on at an 63% discount. FTSE down 12 points at 5795 DAX down 29 points at 7202 CAC down 30 points at 3405 IBEX down 47 points at 7729 FTSE MIB down 236 points at 15349 The biggest reason for the clean sweep of falls was Hurricane Sandy, which sent shares in insurance firms tumbling. Back to Greece, where it appears that the Pasok party has agreed to support the \u20ac13.5bn package of austerity measures hammered out with the Troika. We reported at 12.29 that Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos had raced back for an emergency session with his MPs. According to Greek media site Capital.gr, the meeting agreed to back the measures. That's via Greek journalist Efthimia Efthimiou and here's a Google translation of the story, into English. Pasok's decision means the threat of the Greek government collapsing has receded. However, the other junior coalition partner, Democratic Left, remains opposed to the plan ... Just in \u2013 the Bank of Israel has surprised the markets by cutting interest rates by a quarter-point, to 2%. The Bank of Israel made the move after concluding that Israel's economy could struggle in early 2013 \u2013 and cited the eurozone crisis as a key factor. In a statement, it said: Against the background of the debt crisis in Europe, the level of economic risk from around the world remains high, and with it the concerns over negative effects on the local economy. It's the latest in a string of rate cuts by central banks around the globe, as concern has grown about the world economy. None of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a cut, and the move has sent the shekel falling against the dollar. Madrid correspondent Giles Tremlett adds that Monti and Rajoy were cagey about whether they will seek soft eurozone bailouts so that the European Central Bank could start buying their bonds and bring down borrowing costs. Giles writes: Their answers varied from \"no\" to \"maybe\". Monti said that Italy simply did not need it. \"We do not think that Italy is in such a condition that it needs to use this instrument,\" he said. Rajoy insisted that Spain did not need a bailout yet, but he did not rule one out. \"In this moment the Spanish government has not asked for it, because it does not believe it is absolutely necessary in order to protect the interests of the Spanish people,\" he said. \"If we do think it is necessary, then we will communicate it and explain our reasons.\" Mario Monti and Mariano Rajoy have finished their bilateral meeting in Madrid (see 14.32pm onwards for highlights of their press conference, and a few photos) Here's our correspondent Giles Tremlett's report: Neither man showed much enthusiasm for Mario Draghi's proposals for a \"super commissioner\" to police national budgets and punish bad performers. The idea, originally mooted by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, \"is not an idea I like, if it comes on its own\" said Rajoy. The Spanish prime minister asked for a much wider and more ambitious plan towards greater fiscal, banking and political union - saying that the European Union needs to take the same approach as when the euro was founded, marking objectives and the dates on which they must be achieved. Monti simply claimed not to have read the Der Spiegel interview in which Draghi backs the Germans, but recalled that France and Germany were the first to break the stability pact by overrunning deficit limits in 2003. The Italian also refused to answer a question on whether Silvio Berlusconi's threat to withdraw suport for his government was responsible for sending Italy's bond yields rising again today. \"You can ask that question to the political parties, and to the markets, but not to me,\" he said, claiming that his duty was merely to keep governing Italy until the spring. I wrote about Berlusconi's threat to trigger a general election, and the alarm this has caused in the City, at 10.14am. Here's a photo from earlier today of Spain's Mariano Rajoy (right) and Italy's Mario Monti at the Moncloa Palace in Madrid today. The pair are listening to their respective national anthems at the start of their bilateral summit. I'm not sure why the soldier pictured has a saw... And here are a couple of pictures from the Rajoy-Monti press conference (see 14.32 onwards): Italy's Mario Monti has also criticised the idea of a new EU commissioner with new powers over national government budgets. The technocratic PM agreed with Spain's Mariano Rajoy (see 14.32), and argued that such a move could be counter-productive - and could make financial markets more suspicious. Mariano Rajoy went on to tell reporters that he could ask for an aid package if the Madrid government thinks it is in the interest of Spaniards. Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has criticised the suggestion that eurozone countries should surrender sovereignty and agree to the creation of a European Commissioner with new powers over national budgets of euro countries. Speaking at a press conference with Mario Monti, Italy's leader, in Madrid, Rajoy argued that this was only acceptable as part of a full package of closer integration. Rajoy said: This is an idea, that considered on its own, I personally don't like. As part of a variety of measures for fiscal union, it could be considered. As I blogged about back at 8.09am, ECB president Mario Draghi has expressed strong support for a \"currency commissioner\", saying it would strengthen the euro. In Athens today, an investigative journalist appeared in court after publishing what may be the controversial list of tax evaders. Kostas Vaxevanis, a magazine editor, was arrested on Sunday after publishing what he says is the Lagarde List \u2013 2,000 names of people who are suspected of using Swiss bank accounts to dodge the Greek tax authorities. Vaxevanis arrest caused outrage in Greece \u2013 and some astonishment that the first (and so far only) person apprehended over the scandal is the man who published it. Here's a typical reaction: Vaxevanis appeared before a packed courtroom this morning, where he was told that he has until Thursday to prepare his defense. There were large crowds outside, who applauded the editor and his legal team when they emerged afterwards \u2013 and insisted that publishing the list (which was lost by the previous Greek government) was in the national interest: Our correspondent, Helena Smith, has now interviewed Vaxevanis's lawyer, Harris Ikonomopoulos, who argued that the case is extremely important. Ikonomopoulos said: It is a matter of huge public interest that documents which have not been investigated for three years be finally revealed. The publication of the list would not have been necessary had Papaconstantinou and Venizelos [former finance ministers] along with the tax fraud office done their jobs and the political environment was not now being fuelled by rumours. Vaxevanis has published what he considers to be a double-checked copy of a document that many state authorities have themselves been looking for in recent weeks, fulfilling his duty as a journalist acting in the public interest. Instead of being praised for doing so ... he is treated as an enemy of a system that despite a verbal commitment to transparency appears still unwilling to act in pursuit of it. A twitter hashtag called #freevaxevanis has also been set up. The Netherlands is on the brink of getting a new coalition government, six months after the previous administration was brought down. The free-market VVD party (led by caretaker prime minister Mark Rutte) and the center-left Labor party (led by Diederik Samsom) announced today that they have agreed a deal. VVD won 41 seats in last month's election, followed by Labor with 38. That gives the two parties a working majority in the 150-seat parliament. Rutte and Samsom have been negotiating for weeks, primarily about a new austerity package that includes billions of euros of spending cuts and tax rises. Details of the plan could be released later today. Rutte's previous administration was brought down after far-right leader Geert Wilders withdrew his support. Wilders' anti-immigration Party for Freedom suffered heavy losses in September's election, so he will not have a part in the new government. Reuters is also reporting that Greek banks will delay releasing their financial results by a month (as flagged up at 12.45). The delay is caused by the ongoing deadlock over Greece's austerity programme, and thus its next aid payment A large slice of the delayed \u20ac31.5bn aid tranche is earmarked to recapitalise the Greek banking sector. Without that money, the balance sheets of the Greek banks presumably look pretty grim. Here's the Reuters early take, hot off the terminal: Greek lenders will delay posting six-month results by one more month to the end of November, pending their recapitalisation from the EU and the IMF, a Greek banker said on Monday. [The announcement of financial results] will need to be postponed by a month, until the recapitalisation funds come in,\" said a banker on condition of anonymity. The government had previously pushed back the reporting deadline to October 31. Back in the financial markets, Europe's largest telecoms company Telefonica is testing the appetite of European investors with the IPO of its German subsidiary O2. The shares are expected to begin trading on Tuesday in Frankfurt, and should show whether traders are feeling confidence about the state of the European economy My colleague Nadine Schimroszik reports: \"This is the biggest IPO in Germany for years and sell-out interest in the approximately 1.5 billion euro offering shows growing demand in the market for new share offerings\", said Daniel Winterfeldt, head of International Capital Markets for CMS Cameron McKenna, who represented Telefonica in the transaction. This would be the biggest listing in Germany since engine supplier Tognum raised \u20ac2bn five years ago. Telefonica plans to use the revenues to cut its pile of debt, which is around \u20ac57bn. Financial traders are confident that the market will welcome the IPO, which will still leave Telefonica with a majority stake. If demand is strong, the flotation of O2 could encourage other candidates like the Russian mobile phone operator Megafon, note pad producer Moleskine and British insurer Direct Line. Flotations have been rare in Europe this year. The turmoil in the eurozone has been blamed for several cancelled IPOs, including that of German chemicals company Evonik. Dow Jones is reporting that the next round of results from Greek banks could be delayed, by a month! We'll keep an eye on this.... The deadlock in Greece (see 12.29 for the latest) has help pushed down the value of the euro against the US dollar today. It's down half a cent at $1.289. The Greek government's failure to come to an agreement over the latest round of austerity measures has put Prime Minister Antonis Samaras' government under extraordinary pressure, says our correspondent Helena Smith. Helena writes: Barely five months after it was elected to power, the conservative-led coalition is in a high-wire act as never before. Time is no longer simply of the essence - it is asphyxicating if the government is to agree to the arduous terms the troika has set for continuation of financial assistance to a country that will be forced to declare bankruptcy if the cash installments dry up. The refusal of the small Democratic Left (DIMAR) party to accept further reform of the labour market has put immense pressure on Samaras' other coalition partner, the socialist Pasok party lead by Evangelos Venizelos. The former finance minister, who cut short a trip to Washington DC to rush back to Athens, will shortly hold a crisis meeting with his own MPs amid signs that they, too, will refuse to endorse the reforms in parliament. One insider said: If Dimar MPs vote them down it may well embolden Pasok MPs to do the same ... then we could be talking about the collapse of the government With the party fighting for its own political survival after more than two years of being identified with measures that have brought many Greeks to their knees, Pasok officials are calling the meeting \"one of the most crucial\" since the debt crisis erupted in Athens. This 10.9% slump in Spanish retail sales (see 8.41am) last month has alarmed analysts, who fear that even worse is to come as Spain's austerity programme really kicks in. Silvio Peruzzo, economist at Nomura, warned that the scale of the decline shows that Madrid's forecasts are too optimistic: It's clear there are no signs the crisis is abating The headline figures show a sharp drop and indicate that domestic demand is not going to be anywhere near what the government is anticipating. The Spanish recession is driving more people to seek out lower-cost food and goods. Discount supermarket chain Dia reported this morning that it's profits have tripled so far this year. Reuters has more details. The European Central Bank has caused a frisson of excitement this morning by advertising for three new lawyers, including one with expertise in Greek and one in Spanish: With Greece's austerity package still not agreed, and Spain still pondering seeking its own aid programme, the timing of the postings caused some comment: Could just be coincidence...the ECB was looking for a lawyer who spoke Croatian last week. But there's something just a little worrying about the sight of a central bank bringing more lawyers into the office... The European Central Bank, like Germany (see 11.06), is also refusing to take losses on its \u20ac40bn+ worth of Greek bonds. Speaking in Vienna Ewald Nowotny (ECB board member and head of Austria's central bank), said a haircut was out of the question: Nowotny told reporters in Vienna: For the ECB, forgiving debt isn\u2019t possible because it would be equivalent to indirect state financing Therefore, the ECB certainly can\u2019t participate in a such actions of the public sector, The German government has just reiterated that it firmly opposes writing down the value of its Greek debts. In the last few minutes, government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters in Berlin that public debt restructuring for Greece was out of the question. Such a haircut would contravene German Budget laws and make further aid impossible, he added. Seibert's comments follow the report that the Troika has asked official creditors, such as eurozone governments and the ECB, to cut the value of their Greek debt (see 9.44am). Germany's position is clear \u2013 but analysts question whether it's sustainable (given the fact that Greece is clearly off track and needs a two-year debt extension). Here's some instant reaction from Twitter: Sticking with Italy, Nick Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy reckons many bond traders are too relaxed about the situation in Rome. Writing after Italy sold short-term debt at lower borrowing cost today despite Silvo Berluconi's election threat (see 10.14), Spiro said: Mr Berlusconi's posturing is no competition for the \"Draghi effect\".... The external backdrop is more important in perceptions of Italy's creditworthiness than the domestic one. However, there's a degree of market complacency regarding Italian political risk. The political scene in Italy is becoming more populist and less and less supportive of Mr Monti's economic agenda. Even if an early parliamentary election is averted, the politics of economic reform in Italy are going from bad to worse. Silvio Berlusconi, the disgraced former Italian prime minister, has caused alarm by threatening to bring down the country's government. Fresh from receiving a four-year jail term, Berlusconi declared over the weekend that he was considering hurling Italy into a snap election by withdrawing his party's support for Mario Monti's technocratic administration. As our own John Hooper wrote: Slipping into the royal \"we\", the former prime minister declared: \"In the next few days, we shall decide with the senior members of my party whether to withdraw confidence from the government or, given the closeness of the end of the legislature, leave it to work out its mandate.\" Berlusconi went on to attack Monti's efforts to rein in tax evasion -- in what looked rather like an election manifesto. The financial markets were already jittery about the next Italian general election, scheduled for next spring. The prospect of Monti being unseated this side of Christmas is rather unwelcome. The yield on Italian 10-year bonds has risen by 7 basis points this morning to 4.99% (still much lower than the 7% they crashed through last November in Berlusconi's final days). Analysts are expressing concern this morning. Here's a round-up: Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research: A bit like a child who wants his ball back when a decision goes against him, Berlusconi has been saying that his party will decide in the next few days whether to immediately withdraw support for Mr Monti\u2019s government. This kind of uncertainty could result in some light pressure on Italian bonds but then again there is still a chance that Mr Monti could be in charge after the next set of elections (due to be held in May but timing could change if Mr Berlusconi goes through with his threat). Whilst Mr Monti has made it clear he does not seek the office, in true Jim Hacker style he has of course placed himself to the service of his country so he may well end up as PM for a while yet. Analyst Ralph Silva: David Buik of Cantor Index: Enter stage left the wounded pride of Silvio Berlusconi. Though unlikely to go to the slammer, a year\u2019s suspended sentence may well see him seek revenge with the former PM withdrawing his party\u2019s support for austerity. He appears to still be a very influential politician. So all is not well on the Mediterranean! There's no immediate sign of panic -- Italy just sold \u20ac8bn of six-month bonds at lower yields than last month (at 1.347% vs 1.503% in September). However a bigger test comes tomorrow., when Italy must sell up to \u20ac7bn of 5 and 10-year bonds. A new row is brewing over Greece between the Troika and the German government after it was reported that Troika officials are pushing for public creditors to take losses on their Greek bonds. Der Spiegel (again) said yesterday that the Troika proposed last Thursday that euro governments and the European Central Bank should write down the value of their Greek bonds. Otherwise, they argue, there is no way that Greece will hit its target of bringing its debt pile down to 120% of GDP by 2020. These taxpayer losses sound just like the Official Sector Involvement (OSI) which the IMF has been pushing for in Brussels (as our own Ian Traynor reported more than two weeks ago). Interesting that it was put before eurozone finance ministers last weeek - and further confirmation that we're hearing towards a climax on Greece.... German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, though, is adamant that Germany will not accept such losses. Sch\u00e4uble told German radio that a haircut was: a discussion that has little to do with the reality of the member states of the euro zone. Hmmm. As Ambrose Evans-Pritchard argued in the Telegraph today: \"German politicians are trying to put a gloss of control on a crisis that has long since slipped out of their hands.\" Just in: Spain will announce the details of its new Bad Bank at 5pm local time, or 4pm GMT. This institution will mop up toxic property assets from other lenders, and is part of the drive to clean up Spain's banking system. The plan got the green light from the EU last Friday - details. The prime ministers of Spain and Italy will discuss the eurozone crisis face-to-face today. Mariano Rajoy is hosting Mario Monti in Madrid, and are expected to hold a press conference around 2.45pm local time, or 1.45pm GMT. Both leaders have been at the forefront of the eurozone crisis this year - although Monti has managed to keep Italy out of the spotlight in recent weeks. Analysts reckon that Monti's strategy is for Spain to take a bailout and sign up for new \"conditions\", and for Italy to benefit from the resulting market calm. Here's Bloomberg's take: While both [Rajoy and Monti] have jointly argued against extra budget austerity as the price for help from the European Central Bank, their interests diverge when it comes to whether they should ask for assistance together. A go-it-alone strategy by Spain would probably cut Italy\u2019s borrowing costs while leaving Rajoy to weather the political flak of seeking emergency funds. Spanish retail sales took a severe tumble last month, according to data released this morning. Spain's National Statistics Institute reported that sales plunged by 10.9% in September (compared with the previous year) which is the 27th monthly fall in a row. The dramatic fall is likely to be due to the Spanish government's decision to hike VAT by three percentage points on 1 September, from 18% to 21%. European stock markets have fallen this morning, and the huge storm hitting the US is being blamed... as is the eurozone crisis: Here are the early prices: FTSE 100: down 18 at 5788, - 0.3% German DAX: down 35 points at 7196, -0.5% French CAC: down 26 points at 3409, - 0.75% Italy's FTSE MIB: down 176 points at 15407, - 1.1% Spain's IBEX: down 3 points at 7772, - 0.03% Wall Street will not open today, as New York shuts down in the face of Hurricane Sandy. Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at Interactive Investor, explained: Equity markets have started the week on the back foot, with some traders no doubt taken aback by the late decision to suspend electronic trading across a number of US exchanges in preparation for hurricane Sandy's arrival... The hurricane looks set to continue dominating the news agenda and perhaps it's no surprise that insurers Aviva, Old Mutual, Prudential and Legal &amp; General are some of the biggest losers on the day so far. Downbeat earnings news out of Asia is also continuing to drag on markets whilst a number of investors remain jittery over fringe eurozone countries, but it's going to be that storm and the fact it's making for one of the world's major financial hubs that will continue to attract the attention of most traders. Even without Sandy, the City wouldn't be in a great mood - as traders continue to await developments in both Greece and Spain. As Richard Griffiths of Berkley Futures put it (via Reuters): The focus is still on Spain, and it's been a fairly mixed bunch of results from European companies. The other key development over the weekend is rather a non-development \u2013 the Greek government is still struggling to reach agreement on its \u20ac13.5bn austerity package. Last night Greece's finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, admitted that the two sides are deadlocked again. Democratic Left (the junior partner in the Greek coalition) will not accept new labour reforms, and the Troika will not agree to relax its demands. Stournaras told reporters last night that: The troika has not accepted the (party's) demands According to Reuters, Democratic Left wants the Troika to abandon a plan to abolish the 10% salary increase employees get when they marry. The deadlock means another deadline shuffle. The latest plan is to present the austerity plan to parliament in a week's time, on 5 November \u2013 not this Wednesday as previously planned. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone debt crisis, and other key events in the world economy. First up: Mario Draghi has given a rather fascinating interview to Der Spiegel in which the European Central Bank president defended his recent actions. Draghi told the German newspaper that eurozone states must accept the loss of some sovereignty in order to preserve the single currency. He denied that his massive liquidity schemes and promise of unlimited bond purchases would fuel inflation. Draghi also rejected claims that the European Central Bank has violated its mandate, and argued that German savers should be pleased, not alarmed \u2013 taxpayers might even make a profit on the ECB's bond purchases. A full transcript of the interview was uploaded to the ECB's website this morning. It begins with Spiegel inquiring whether the ex-Goldmanite has any savings (!) before giving Draghi a vigorous grilling. Here are some highlights. On sovereignty: SPIEGEL: Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has proposed giving the EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs a direct say in national budgets. What do you think of that proposal? Draghi: I am fully in favour of it. Governments would be wise to seriously consider it. I firmly believe that, in order to restore confidence in the euro area, countries need to transfer part of their sovereignty to the European level. SPIEGEL: But it is precisely that that many governments are unwilling to do. Why are they so against it? Draghi: A lot of governments have yet to realise that they lost their national sovereignty a long time ago. Because, in the past, they have allowed their debt to pile up, they now need the goodwill of the financial markets. That sounds like a paradox, but it is nonetheless true: it is only once the euro area countries are willing to share sovereignty at the European level that they will gain sovereignty. And on German fears: SPIEGEL: In Germany, people have several reservations about your crisis policies. Were you surprised to receive so much criticism? Draghi: I had the opportunity of a very deep and wide-ranging exchange of views with members of the Bundestag last Wednesday. My impression was that I was able to explain a number of issues, in particular how the measures comply with our mandate to safeguard our independence and to ensure price stability in the medium term. SPIEGEL: This fear stems from historical experience. Germans have learnt that, if central banks flood the markets with money, this always leads to inflation. Draghi: We have to take these fears very seriously. But the correlation is not so simple. In some cases, such as in the Weimar Republic, printing money caused inflation. But in other cases, proactive central bank action did not. Draghi is clearly keen to assuage German concerns \u2013 last Wednesday he spent two hours at the Bundestag answering MPs questions. Preparing the ground before Angela Merkel seeks parliamentary approval for new support for Greece, Spain and/or Cyprus, perhaps....",
