Our latest research into accountancy and finance professionals' expectations for the economy shows 53% believe 2012 will see no deterioration in the UK's economic position. This remarkably positive collective view is a direct result of a strong performance across the industry in 2011. Unless we get more of the same in 2012, we can forget any prospect of a sustained recovery in the UK. Seeking to deny people doing a good and important job the rewards for their accomplishments, whether they work for a public-owned company or not, is the most efficient way to drive talent to markets where enjoying the rewards of success is not considered taboo. Dave Way Marks Sattin Recruitment \u2022 It is time the government stood up to the bankers and called their bluff. It said it had to give Stephen Hester his bonus because, if it had not, the entire RBS board would have resigned. The response to that should have been: \"Do so.\" After all, there must be a limit to the number of bankers who can and would wish to emigrate to Geneva, the Cayman Islands or the Channel Islands etc. Valerie Crews Beckenham, Kent \u2022 I have three questions which I would like to put to the megabucks-earning bankers, in the unlikely event that any of them ever read the Guardian. First, is there any limit to the size of pay and bonus package which they would regard as morally acceptable? Second, do they ever feel any sense of guilt at helping themselves to such a generous share of the national cake, especially when so many of their fellow citizens are poorly paid or out of work? Third, how can they possibly spend these unimaginably large sums, especially in cases where they've been receiving similar amounts for several years? Simon Green Hull \u2022 In most jobs, the \"reward\" for performing well is to keep the job or have one's contract renewed \u2013 and even that is not guaranteed in the current climate. If someone does not do their job properly, sooner or later their employment will be terminated; that alone is supposed to be a sufficient \"incentive\" to work hard and achieve results. Why can bankers not be given the same terms and conditions of employment that the rest of us enjoy? Dr Pete Dorey Bath, Somerset \u2022 Appalled at the RBS ludicrous salaries and bonuses? Then switch to a more ethical bank at once. If we all did that, the message might just possibly get heard and even acted on. Professor Charles Warlow Edinburgh",

    "webTitle": "Spain demands new 'realism' from EU over austerity", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Spanish unemployment breaks through the 5 million barrier, the new government of Mariano Rajoy has begun to put pressure on the European Union to ease Spain's deficit targets, which are sending the country hurtling back into recession. Rajoy's government is demanding greater \"realism\" from Brussels as it struggles to rein in a deficit that ended more than two percentage points, or \u20ac20bn, above its EU-set 6% target last year. EU officials are unlikely to greet his message with enthusiasm after continued wrangling in Athens over a deal with private creditors and a torrid day on the bond markets that pushed Portugal closer to needing a Greek-style rescue. Brussels indicated that talks in Greece would take at least another 48 hours. And on Friday, ratings agency Fitch downgraded five countries \u2013 Spain, Italy, Belgium, Cyprus and Slovenia \u2013 with Spain pushed down by two notches. The move came two weeks after Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded nine eurozone countries, including France, which lost its coveted AAA status. Rajoy's attempt to strike a more relaxed deal on debt echoes that of Italy's new technocrat prime minister, Mario Monti, who has been telling German policymakers that austerity alone may not be the answer to the eurozone's problems. EU leaders will meet in Brussels on Monday: the agenda will include tweaking policies to promote jobs and growth. A draft of the summit statement obtained by the Guardian says: \"Growth and employment will only resume if we pursue a consistent and broad-based approach, combining fiscal consolidation, sound macroeconomic policies as well as an active employment strategy. We will stay the course and emerge from this crisis stronger.\" Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission's president, said: \"We cannot resort to fiscal stimulus to boost growth.\" Spain, which already boasted Europe's worst unemployment rate, recorded a further 350,000 job losses in the last quarter of 2011. That rate now stands at 22.8% of the population and is set to worsen as Rajoy's conservative People's party government pursues a \u20ac40bn (\u00a333bn) budget adjustment, most of it in spending cuts, to meet the EU's deficit target of 4.4% this year. Pressure for Brussels to review Spain's deficit came as bond investors began to abandon neighbouring Portugal, with 10-year bond yields soaring to 15%. Bonds expert Gary Jenkins of Swordfish said: \"They may have crossed the Rubicon in the eyes of the market\". He believes the talks between the Greek government and its bondholders might \"become a template for Portugal in how to deal with their debt, which would not be good news for investors.\" S&amp;P already rates Portugal's bonds as \"junk\", along with Greece's. With a record 5.3m unemployed, Spain is facing a spiral of decline. The IMF, led by a former euro-area finance minister, Christine Lagarde (pictured below), has already predicted that the economy will shrink by 1.7% this year, with a further decline in 2013. Further evidence that public austerity programmes were damaging the wider Spanish economy came from figures on company closures. Around 35,000 companies folded in the second half of the year \u2013 a third of all those to have shut since Spain's economy ran into trouble at the end of 2008. While Rajoy, who met Germany's chancellor, Angel Merkel, in Berlin on Thursday, publicly maintains his target of reducing the deficit to 4.4% from more than 8% last year, his ministers are now letting it be known that they want substantial adjustments to Brussels's programme. Budget minister Crist\u00f3bal Montoro was explicit about the need for the EU to adjust its predictions \u2013 and, logically, its targets. \"I am sure that no one, in Europe or anywhere else, is interested in including growth estimates that are not going to be met,\" he said, adding he was convinced change would come. That, he said, would help the government to be \"realistic\" about its options. The socialist opposition, meanwhile, is already complaining that Rajoy has not persuaded Brussels to relax the pressure. \"The rope is tightening around our neck,\" said Carme Chac\u00f3n, one of two candidates to succeed former prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero as party leader. Rajoy's government has already announced a combination of income tax rises and spending cuts that will bring a \u20ac15bn adjustment, but that is less than half of what is needed.",

      "body": "<p>As Spanish unemployment breaks through the 5 million barrier, the new government of Mariano Rajoy has begun to put pressure on the European Union to ease Spain's deficit targets, which are sending the country hurtling back into recession.</p> <p>Rajoy's government is demanding greater \"realism\" from Brussels as it struggles to rein in a deficit that ended more than two percentage points, or \u20ac20bn, above its EU-set 6% target last year.</p> <p>EU officials are unlikely to greet his message with enthusiasm after continued wrangling in Athens over a deal with private creditors and a torrid day on the bond markets that pushed Portugal closer to needing a Greek-style rescue. Brussels indicated that talks in Greece would take at least another 48 hours.</p> <p>And on Friday, ratings agency Fitch downgraded five countries \u2013 Spain, Italy, Belgium, Cyprus and Slovenia \u2013 with Spain pushed down by two notches. The move came two weeks after Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded nine eurozone countries, including France, which lost its coveted AAA status.</p> <p>Rajoy's attempt to strike a more relaxed deal on debt echoes that of Italy's new technocrat prime minister, Mario Monti, who has been telling German policymakers that austerity alone may not be the answer to the eurozone's problems.</p> <p>EU leaders will meet in Brussels on Monday: the agenda will include tweaking policies to promote jobs and growth. A draft of the summit statement obtained by the Guardian says: \"Growth and employment will only resume if we pursue a consistent and broad-based approach, combining fiscal consolidation, sound macroeconomic policies as well as an active employment strategy. We will stay the course and emerge from this crisis stronger.\"</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission's president, said: \"We cannot resort to fiscal stimulus to boost growth.\"</p> <p>Spain, which already boasted Europe's worst unemployment rate, recorded a further 350,000 job losses in the last quarter of 2011.</p> <p>That rate now stands at 22.8% of the population and is set to worsen as Rajoy's conservative People's party government pursues a \u20ac40bn (\u00a333bn) budget adjustment, most of it in spending cuts, to meet the EU's deficit target of 4.4% this year.</p> <p>Pressure for Brussels to review Spain's deficit came as bond investors began to abandon neighbouring Portugal, with 10-year bond yields soaring to 15%. Bonds expert Gary Jenkins of Swordfish said: \"They may have crossed the Rubicon in the eyes of the market\". He believes the talks between the Greek government and its bondholders might \"become a template for Portugal in how to deal with their debt, which would not be good news for investors.\" S&amp;P already rates Portugal's bonds as \"junk\", along with Greece's.</p> <p>With a record 5.3m unemployed, Spain is facing a spiral of decline. The IMF, led by a former euro-area finance minister, Christine Lagarde (pictured below), has already predicted that the economy will shrink by 1.7% this year, with a further decline in 2013.</p> <p>Further evidence that public austerity programmes were damaging the wider Spanish economy came from figures on company closures. Around 35,000 companies folded in the second half of the year \u2013 a third of all those to have shut since Spain's economy ran into trouble at the end of 2008.</p> <p>While Rajoy, who met Germany's chancellor, Angel Merkel, in Berlin on Thursday, publicly maintains his target of reducing the deficit to 4.4% from more than 8% last year, his ministers are now letting it be known that they want substantial adjustments to Brussels's programme.</p> <p>Budget minister Crist\u00f3bal Montoro was explicit about the need for the EU to adjust its predictions \u2013 and, logically, its targets. \"I am sure that no one, in Europe or anywhere else, is interested in including growth estimates that are not going to be met,\" he said, adding he was convinced change would come. That, he said, would help the government to be \"realistic\" about its options.</p> <p>The socialist opposition, meanwhile, is already complaining that Rajoy has not persuaded Brussels to relax the pressure. \"The rope is tightening around our neck,\" said Carme Chac\u00f3n, one of two candidates to succeed former prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero as party leader.</p> <p>Rajoy's government has already announced a combination of income tax rises and spending cuts that will bring a \u20ac15bn adjustment, but that is less than half of what is needed.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Imperial Tobacco</strong> has ended the week on a strong note after a volatile few days.</p> <p>Its shares were boosted on Wednesday by talk of possible bid interest from Japan Tobacco, but they fell back once analysts poured cold water on the idea.</p> <p>However they finished Friday 36p higher at \u00a322.89 as a couple of brokers issued positive notes ahead of the company's first quarter update next Wednesday.</p> <p>In a buy note, Adam Spielman at Citigroup edged up his price target from \u00a325.50 to \u00a325.70 and said:</p> <blockquote> We expect the statement to be brief, with few hard numbers other than \"white stick equivalent\" volumes and organic growth of tobacco net sales. The first quarter statement accompanies the annual meeting, and last year Imperial used it to say it would increase its dividend. We think it is quite possible that this time it makes another, analogous announcement \u2013 perhaps an increase in the buyback \u2013 that it hopes the market will like. <br> In the second half, volumes were down 2% and sales up 2%. In this quarter, we expect a temporary deterioration to a 5% volume fall and a 1% sales decline. The comparisons are much harder (especially in Spain), and there are also two one-off issues: (1) UN sanctions have forced Imperial to stop supplying Syria and (2) there has been destocking in Ukraine.  With this note we are lowering our earnings per share estimates by about 1% but this is solely for the weakness of the euro. In organic terms we are making no changes at all. Tobacco profits depend principally on pricing, and Imperial has already locked in good price increases in the UK, Germany, Spain, the US, and France this fiscal year. One quarter's volume is of little significance.  In the past 10 years, Imperial has risen every single December, with an average a rise of 7%. However it usually falls in January (average decline: 3%) as investors start the year with a pro-cyclical tilt, before rising in the following months. This year the trend has been particularly marked, but we think it represents a good opportunity to buy into a company that's now at about 11 times 2012 PE and where earnings growth is both decent (about 8%-9% ex-currency) and very secure. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile Credit Suisse kept its outperform rating with a \u00a325 target price, saying:</p> <blockquote> Rotation out of tobacco stocks year-to-date, a difficult comparison base for first quarter, foreign exchange headwinds and softening volume trends in key European markets (confirmed by AC Nielsen data released yesterday) have not helped Imperial shares of late. <br> So why outperform? Pricing in core markets is looking good and momentum should improve as the comparison base will ease significantly in the next two quarters. Imperial's valuation and dividend yield look supportive and our expectations of low-teen dividend per share growth in 2012-2013 are unchanged. </blockquote> <p>Overall leading shares fell back as Greece's talks with its private bondholders dragged on and investors continued to worry about the rest of the eurozone, particularly Portugal. Mildly disappointing US economic growth figures did not help sentiment. The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished down 61.75 points at 5733.45, up just five points since Monday although earlier in the week, as hopes of a Greek settlement grew, the index touched a new six month high.</p> <p>Commodity prices continued to rise as the dollar weakened in the wake of Wednesday's comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke that the country's interest rates would remain low until at least 2014.</p> <p>With gold climbing to $1726 an ounce - its best weekly performance since early December - it was a good time for <strong>African Barrick Gold</strong> to announce an 11% increase in its total resources, thanks to the company raising the estimate of gold contained at its Nyanzaga project in Tanzania. Collins Stewart said:</p> <blockquote> The resource expansion clearly demonstrates that African Barrick has undervalued growth opportunities within the company, partially countering the claim that the group does not offer growth. </blockquote> <p>African Barrick added 26p to 515.5p. But profit taking hit some of the other miners, with <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closing down 34p at \u00a311.60 after Credit Suisse put an underperform rating on the shares and <strong>Antofagasta</strong> falling 42p to \u00a313.48.</p> <p><strong>Intercontinental Hotels</strong> lost 36p to \u00a313.21 after UBS cut its rating from neutral to sell. Analyst Simon Whittington said:</p> <blockquote> We remain relatively cautious on European hotel stocks for 2012. We currently expect modest positive RevPar [revenue per average room] growth in 2012-13, but uncertainty remains and the slowing occupancy growth <br>has often historically led to stock underperformance.  We move Intercontinental to sell following its recent strong performance. The company is well placed geographically, reflected in our RevPar assumptions being ahead of peers'. Despite this, earnings per share are expected to grow at 3%-4% over 2012-13. We believe there is a strong possibility of a special dividend in 2012, but this is more than priced in, and the company will have to accelerate its capital investment to achieve its target 3%-5% room count growth, given the low supply growth. </blockquote> <p><strong>Serco</strong>, the outsourcing group whose projects include London's cycle hire scheme, UK immigration centres and the Dubai metro, slipped 5p to 509p after an internal restructuring involving 500 job cuts, around 1% of its UK workforce. The company also announced a contract worth \u00a355m over two years to provide training to the British Army. A larger recruitment contract for the army is due to be awarded before the end of February.</p> <p><strong>GKN</strong>, the automotive and aerospace group, lost 4.8p to 209.8p following lower than expected earnings from US car group Ford. GKN also announced the dissolution of its joint venture arrangements with Jtekt in Thailand, at a cost of up to \u00a39m.</p> <p>Building materials group <strong>Wolseley </strong>was 55p lower at \u00a322.19. Analyst Ian Osburn at ING Bank downgraded from buy to hold, but raised his target price from \u00a320 to \u00a321.50. He said:</p> <blockquote> Wolseley's shares have had a great run (up 53% in four months) driven, in our view, by improving sentiment in the US and margin growth. But we think the market is: 1) in danger of becoming over-optimistic about the US, where we do not see key indicators for a sustained recovery; and 2) missing that Wolseley's European countries appear universally negative. <br> Hopes for <a href=\"http://www.build.com/\" title=\"\">build.com</a> could be overdone (the website hardly registers on Google compared with rivals) and copper price falls imply margin pressure from April. We think the shares have run their course for now. <br> </blockquote> <p><strong>Mothercare</strong> was steady at 197p on growing fears of competition in the UK, where the mother and baby retailer is already struggling and could take two years to turn around.</p> <p>This week's news that supermarket group <strong>Morrisons</strong>, up 0.5p to 292.6p, has taken over ten former Best Buy stores to roll out its rival Kiddicare brand has just emphasised the struggle ahead for Mothercare in the UK. The company - which is doing well internationally - is already reviewing its UK store portfolio and strategy.</p> <p>On Kiddicare, analysts at Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> While the immediate threat to Mothercare should not be over-estimated, given that Kiddicare is coming from a small base, the longer-term potential is clear: Kiddicare is not starting with the baggage of a UK high street store portfolio and has an excellent online proposition already, supported by the backing of Morrison. </blockquote> <p>They repeated their sell rating, as did Panmure Gordon analyst Jean Roche after a meeting with Mothercare.</p> <p>Lower down the market, <strong>Creston</strong> fell 24% to 51p after the communications group said fourth quarter revenues would be below expectations and full year profits would fall short of last year's figure. It blamed a shortfall in new business in the final quarter, increased staffing levels to cope with an expected rise in revenues, customer project delays and start up costs.</p> <p>Finally shares in jewellery maker <strong>Abbeycrest</strong> were suspended at 1.5p \"pending clarification of the group's financial position.\"</p> <p>The company has been hit by competitive market conditions, uncertainty at its retail customers and rises in precious metal prices. It had been trying to sell its business in Thailand to an overseas buyer to raise cash, but that could not be done in time to ease its working capital problems. It said:</p> <blockquote> It is now clear to the board that there is no prospect of completing a sale of Abbeycrest Thailand within the time constraints imposed by Abbeycrest's funding position. </blockquote>",

Commodity prices continued to rise as the dollar weakened in the wake of Wednesday's comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke that the country's interest rates would remain low until at least 2014. With gold climbing to $1726 an ounce - its best weekly performance since early December - it was a good time for African Barrick Gold to announce an 11% increase in its total resources, thanks to the company raising the estimate of gold contained at its Nyanzaga project in Tanzania. Collins Stewart said: The resource expansion clearly demonstrates that African Barrick has undervalued growth opportunities within the company, partially countering the claim that the group does not offer growth. African Barrick added 26p to 515.5p. But profit taking hit some of the other miners, with Kazakhmys closing down 34p at \u00a311.60 after Credit Suisse put an underperform rating on the shares and Antofagasta falling 42p to \u00a313.48. Intercontinental Hotels lost 36p to \u00a313.21 after UBS cut its rating from neutral to sell. Analyst Simon Whittington said: We remain relatively cautious on European hotel stocks for 2012. We currently expect modest positive RevPar [revenue per average room] growth in 2012-13, but uncertainty remains and the slowing occupancy growth has often historically led to stock underperformance. We move Intercontinental to sell following its recent strong performance. The company is well placed geographically, reflected in our RevPar assumptions being ahead of peers'. Despite this, earnings per share are expected to grow at 3%-4% over 2012-13. We believe there is a strong possibility of a special dividend in 2012, but this is more than priced in, and the company will have to accelerate its capital investment to achieve its target 3%-5% room count growth, given the low supply growth. Serco, the outsourcing group whose projects include London's cycle hire scheme, UK immigration centres and the Dubai metro, slipped 5p to 509p after an internal restructuring involving 500 job cuts, around 1% of its UK workforce. The company also announced a contract worth \u00a355m over two years to provide training to the British Army. A larger recruitment contract for the army is due to be awarded before the end of February. GKN, the automotive and aerospace group, lost 4.8p to 209.8p following lower than expected earnings from US car group Ford. GKN also announced the dissolution of its joint venture arrangements with Jtekt in Thailand, at a cost of up to \u00a39m. Building materials group Wolseley was 55p lower at \u00a322.19. Analyst Ian Osburn at ING Bank downgraded from buy to hold, but raised his target price from \u00a320 to \u00a321.50. He said: Wolseley's shares have had a great run (up 53% in four months) driven, in our view, by improving sentiment in the US and margin growth. But we think the market is: 1) in danger of becoming over-optimistic about the US, where we do not see key indicators for a sustained recovery; and 2) missing that Wolseley's European countries appear universally negative. Hopes for build.com could be overdone (the website hardly registers on Google compared with rivals) and copper price falls imply margin pressure from April. We think the shares have run their course for now. Mothercare was steady at 197p on growing fears of competition in the UK, where the mother and baby retailer is already struggling and could take two years to turn around. This week's news that supermarket group Morrisons, up 0.5p to 292.6p, has taken over ten former Best Buy stores to roll out its rival Kiddicare brand has just emphasised the struggle ahead for Mothercare in the UK. The company - which is doing well internationally - is already reviewing its UK store portfolio and strategy. On Kiddicare, analysts at Espirito Santo said: While the immediate threat to Mothercare should not be over-estimated, given that Kiddicare is coming from a small base, the longer-term potential is clear: Kiddicare is not starting with the baggage of a UK high street store portfolio and has an excellent online proposition already, supported by the backing of Morrison. They repeated their sell rating, as did Panmure Gordon analyst Jean Roche after a meeting with Mothercare. Lower down the market, Creston fell 24% to 51p after the communications group said fourth quarter revenues would be below expectations and full year profits would fall short of last year's figure. It blamed a shortfall in new business in the final quarter, increased staffing levels to cope with an expected rise in revenues, customer project delays and start up costs. Finally shares in jewellery maker Abbeycrest were suspended at 1.5p \"pending clarification of the group's financial position.\" The company has been hit by competitive market conditions, uncertainty at its retail customers and rises in precious metal prices. It had been trying to sell its business in Thailand to an overseas buyer to raise cash, but that could not be done in time to ease its working capital problems. It said: It is now clear to the board that there is no prospect of completing a sale of Abbeycrest Thailand within the time constraints imposed by Abbeycrest's funding position.",

      "bodyText": "The Royal Bank of Scotland has spent more than $4m (\u00a32.5m) of British taxpayers' money on lobbyists in Washington since it was bailed out by the government, documents disclose. Both in-house and commercial lobbyists have been paid to influence American senators and congressmen reforming US finance law since the bank's collapse and government bailout in October 2008. The money has been handed over despite calls from ministers for RBS and other banks that have received taxpayers' handouts to refrain from hiring public affairs firms. It comes amid criticism of the decision to give the bank's chief executive, Stephen Hester, almost \u00a31m in a bonus this year. According to the documents, the bank spent $4.13m from October 2008 to December 2011 on lobbyists as it tried to influence three different areas of legislation. The bank sought influence over consumer protection, with proposed legislation such as the Consumer Overdraft Protection Fair Practices Act and the US Credit Card Act. These proposed laws wanted to make it harder for young people to be given credit cards, have their credit limits extended and over the imposition of limits on interest rates. They also suggested a possible limit on hidden overdraft charges and penalty fees. In 2009 and 2010, the RBS subsidiaries also lobbied on a range of banking reforms including the Dodds-Frank Wall Street Act, the largest of the US banking reform acts. This act covers the amount capital banks must hold as well as demands that banks publish the ratio of the highest paid bankers to average wages. The documents, which were released by the US government and list lobbying activity in the US, show the lobbyist, client, amount spent and subject of the lobbying, as per US rules. Under the parameters of the government's proposed changes to lobbying rules in the UK, released last week as part of a discussion paper, none of the equivalent details will be available in Britain. Unlike US lobbying regulations, David Cameron's reforms will not list in-house lobbyists, nor will they show amounts spent or subjects involved. RBS has spent most of its efforts this year lobbying on attempts to reform \"swipe\" card fees. US politicians want to help small businesses by limiting the amount banks can charge for card transactions made with swipe machines. RBS lobbies with in-house staff at two US subsidiaries, RBS Securities and Citizen's Financial. It also uses DLA Piper, the international lobbying and law firm. Lobbying records state that \"Royal Bank of Scotland, a parent company to the registrant, is interested in the issues listed\". Some documents acknowledge the bank's UK government backing, saying that \"Royal Bank of Scotland and UK Financial Investments Ltd, parent companies to the client, are interested in the issues listed\" \u2013 UK Financial Investments is the UK government's shareholder in RBS. In Britain, RBS paid six lobbying firms last year. It also employs its own team of internal corporate lobbyists to influence ministers. At the moment, most large agencies sign up to a voluntary register detailing who they work for, but there is no record of internal lobbyists employed by companies or industry groups, or who they are lobbying. Agencies are also under no compulsion to publish details of all their clients \u2013 and there is a suspicion that the names of some clients are being withheld from public scrutiny. The communities secretary, Eric Pickles, told the Guardian in 2010: \"Taxpayer-funded campaigns conducted by private lobbying firms mean \u2026 public policy is weakened and public discourse becomes a soundbite battle.\" An RBS spokesperson said: \"We have been focused on understanding the many proposals regarding the regulation of our industry in the US to ensure our ability to anticipate new guidelines, maintain compliance and keep our customers informed of necessary updates to our policies, products and services in a time of significant change.\" \u2022 This article was corrected on 28 January 2012.

Official figures showed that GDP expanded by around 0.7% quarter-on-quarter in the last three months, or 2.8% if the growth rate was maintained for a year. Although a slightly weaker performance than Wall Street investors had expected, it was still far stronger than the UK, where the economy contracted at the end of 2011. Consumer spending expanded at an annual rate of 2%, according to the US Department oC commerce, and net exports were also positive, helping to offset falling public spending.

The department said that almost 2% of the 2.8% GDP growth was accounted for by firms rebuilding their stocks of goods \u2013 an effect that is likely to be temporary.

Sharp declines in unemployment in recent months have raised hopes that the economy is past the worst.

      "bodyText": "Spanish unemployment broke through the 5-million barrier on Friday as the new government of Mariano Rajoy began to quietly beg the European Union to ease up on deficit targets that are sending the country hurtling back into recession. Spain, which already boasted Europe's worst unemployment rate, recorded 350,000 people losing their jobs in the last quarter of 2011. That rate now stands at 22.8% of the population and is set to worsen as Rajoy's conservative People's party government pursues a \u20ac40bn (\u00a333bn) budget adjustment, most of it in spending cuts, to meet the EU's deficit target of 4.4% this year. With a record 5.3 million unemployed, Spain faces a spiral of decline. The IMF has already predicted that the economy will shrink by 1.7% this year, with a further decline in 2013. While Rajoy, who met German chancellor Angel Merkel in Berlin on Thursday, publicly maintains his target of reducing the deficit to 4.4% from more than 8% last year, his ministers are letting it be known that they want the EU to ease up on deficit targets which require severe adjustments. Rajoy himself has pointed out that the EU's target for 2011 supposed not only that last year's deficit would be 6%, but also that growth this year would reach 2.3%. \"We need growth predictions from Brussels and that is when we will start negotiating with them on Spain's stability programme,\" the finance minister, Luis de Guindos said. Almost 1.5m Spanish households now have no wage earner, with 3.5 million people joining the dole queue over the past four-and-a-half years. Southern Andalucia has a 31% unemployment rate, while 35% of immigrants and 39% of under-25s are jobless. \"Harsh adjustment policies not only fail to solve the problem, they can make it worse,\" warned C\u00e1ndido M\u00e9ndez of the General Workers' Union. Further evidence that public austerity programmes were damaging the wider economy came from figures on company closures. Around 35,000 companies folded in the second half of the year \u2013 a third of all those to have shut since Spain's economy ran into trouble at the end of 2008. Much of the spending cuts have to come from regional governments, who provide basic services such as health, education and social services. Spain's pharmaceutical companies said regional governments were now taking 525 days to pay bills for medicines provided to hospitals, with \u20ac6.3bn outstanding. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Caixa savings bank, Isidre Fain\u00e9, predicted further gloom in the housing market, in which up to 700,000 new-build homes remain unsold after a housing bubble burst several years ago. He predicted that house prices, which have dropped around 30% since their peak, could fall to 50% or 60% of their top value before recovering.",

And the biggest day of this year's World Economic Forum (WEF) on Friday may include a main room event discussing \"women as the way forward\".</p> <p>But while the impact of women this year may be bigger than ever, organisers keen to encourage and then trumpet their success cannot hide the fact that their numbers are still small.</p> <p>Despite a new quota system demanding that the largest members send one woman for every four men, just 17% of the 2,500 delegates are female. Despite a push to encourage more women on to panels to discuss the issues of the day, just 20% of those invited to do so are women. The majority of panels, especially on key economic topics, are still dominated by (white) men.</p> <p>Although the days are long gone when one female delegate was asked to leave an event because security assumed she must be a spouse without the required permit, the majority of the women in Davos are not there as participants. Only newcomers to Davos seem to consider this fact remarkable, with the odd feminist exception such as Helen Clark. The former prime minister of New Zealand turned administrator of the United Nations Development Programme called the female participation rate \"pathetic\". The leader who appointed so many senior women to her cabinet that Benetton ran an airport advertising campaign welcoming visitors to the \"women's republic of New Zealand\" called for organisers to commit to the millennium development goal of 30% female participation by 2015. \"Or why not next year? They should just go and look for the women. In one stroke, participation would go up.\"</p> <p>There is little support for such intervention among organisers, who argue that Davos merely reflects a world in which women lead just 3% of the biggest companies in the US and UK and make up 17% of its parliaments. Saadia Zahidi, the WEF's head of constituents who is spearheading the gender programme, calls this the \"external glass ceiling\" about which an annual meeting of top people can do nothing.</p> <p>Roger Carr, the chairman of Centrica who is leading efforts to get more women appointed to British boards, agrees. \"Davos is a special place populated by the most senior decision makers. The fact is that the number of women in that position is quite small. Davos is just the symptom of something that happened way, way back.\" Centrica sends just two delegates and both the chief executive and chairman happen to be men.</p> <p>With the cost of the meeting astronomical \u2013 delegates have to pay for five nights' stay as a minimum \u2013 not to mention the annual membership fees of about \u00a3100,000 for the strategic partners subject to the quota, many companies are happy to talk the talk while hoping that others do the walking.</p> <p>So why even bother to set a quota? Why not simply accept the status quo at an event which sums up a world governed by just 1% of its population? Is the whole gender parity programme part of a cynical PR exercise to encourage a belief that the most powerful people in the world care about half the world's population?</p> <p>There are two answers to this from within Davos. The first, that it is not a numbers exercise but good business, is summed up by Carr when he says: \"This is nothing to do with PR. It's just good business. I've sat on single gender boards and mixed ones and the latter improves the dynamics of the meetings and ultimately the decision making itself.\"</p> <p>This view is echoed by WEF founder Klaus Schwab, who says: \"A world where women make up less than 20% of the global decision makers is a world that is missing a huge opportunity for growth and ignoring an untapped reservoir of potential.\" The more popular sessions dealing with gender tended to be those discussing this \"diversity dividend\" or whether \"decision making is better when there's a diverse set of people making the decisions\".</p> <p>This idea plays into one theme of this year's Davos: that as the current economic and political crisis was made by men, the inclusion of more women can only help matters. Desmond Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town, brought a cheer to proceedings when he said: \"What we need is a revolution led by women. I think women ought to be saying to us men: 'You have made a mess, just get out and let us in'.\"</p> <p>Even Christine Lagarde said before becoming the head of the IMF, an institution criticised for its own role in the financial crisis, that the world might be a different place if there had been a bank called \"Lehman Sisters\".</p> <p>But there is also a wider political agenda which fits into the idea that diversity will help close the gap between the 1% and the 99% they govern. The charismatic chief operating officer of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, captured this in introducing Gbowee on Wednesday night when she said: \"If the central moral imperative of the 19th century was slavery and of the 20th, totalitarianism, the central moral imperative of our time is the equality of girls and women around the world.\"</p> <p>There is evidence that investing in girls and women in developing countries does have a dramatic impact on the economy. Cherie Blair, who set up a foundation for women, says the issue is the most important one on the Davos agenda: \"I don't think the people who go to Davos deny that this is a major issue \u2026 They read the same reports about the value of investing in women in terms of education and employment as I do.\"</p> <p>Various studies suggest greater involvement by the poorest and the wealthiest women could help the global economy. The World Food Programme has found that girls and women reinvest 90% of each dollar in their families by buying food, books and medicine, for example. For men, that figure is more like 30% to 40%.</p> <p>So, if participation at the most senior levels is to be encouraged, what is being done about it? A private breakfast of the forum's female leaders and gender parity board on Wednesday discussed a document due to be published in March which will set out best practices to achieve greater diversity. These include a focus on measurement and audit, mentoring and sponsorship and a change to the way home and work life is shared. None of these are mandatory although an appearance by Viviane Reding, who is considering the introduction of quotas across the eurozone, is keenly anticipated on Friday.</p> <p>Advocates of change insist that most effort should be directed at the middle management level, the point at which most women fall by the wayside, victims of either family-unfriendly policies or the failure to network for the top jobs. The forum's effort to help involves an outfit called the Young Global Leaders, a network of about 1,000 people who are picked for greatness before the age of 40. Of these, 42% of these are women, while the newly formed Global Shapers of over-achievers under 30 are split 50/50.</p> <p>The big question is, how many of these graduate to actually run companies or countries? WEF doesn't give out these figures.</p> <p>However, its efforts to become more inclusive does seem to have led to a marked cultural shift. Anuradha Vittachi, who has been attending Davos for years as founder of the OneWorld development group, says: \"The panel used to look at the brown female wearing a sari with her hand up and point to someone else in the audience to ask a question.\" That is no longer the case, she acknowledges.</p> <p>Blair says: \"If the world doesn't start giving a proper platform for women, then it will fall flat on its face.\"</p> <p>Clark agrees. Asked whether leaders are paying lip service to gender equality as they battle to put out the global economic fires, she says: \"Maybe, but we can't let them off the hook. We just have to keep on keeping on.\"</p>",

The fact is that the number of women in that position is quite small. Davos is just the symptom of something that happened way, way back.\" Centrica sends just two delegates and both the chief executive and chairman happen to be men. With the cost of the meeting astronomical \u2013 delegates have to pay for five nights' stay as a minimum \u2013 not to mention the annual membership fees of about \u00a3100,000 for the strategic partners subject to the quota, many companies are happy to talk the talk while hoping that others do the walking. So why even bother to set a quota? Why not simply accept the status quo at an event which sums up a world governed by just 1% of its population? Is the whole gender parity programme part of a cynical PR exercise to encourage a belief that the most powerful people in the world care about half the world's population? There are two answers to this from within Davos. The first, that it is not a numbers exercise but good business, is summed up by Carr when he says: \"This is nothing to do with PR. It's just good business. I've sat on single gender boards and mixed ones and the latter improves the dynamics of the meetings and ultimately the decision making itself.\" This view is echoed by WEF founder Klaus Schwab, who says: \"A world where women make up less than 20% of the global decision makers is a world that is missing a huge opportunity for growth and ignoring an untapped reservoir of potential.\" The more popular sessions dealing with gender tended to be those discussing this \"diversity dividend\" or whether \"decision making is better when there's a diverse set of people making the decisions\". This idea plays into one theme of this year's Davos: that as the current economic and political crisis was made by men, the inclusion of more women can only help matters. Desmond Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town, brought a cheer to proceedings when he said: \"What we need is a revolution led by women. I think women ought to be saying to us men: 'You have made a mess, just get out and let us in'.\" Even Christine Lagarde said before becoming the head of the IMF, an institution criticised for its own role in the financial crisis, that the world might be a different place if there had been a bank called \"Lehman Sisters\". But there is also a wider political agenda which fits into the idea that diversity will help close the gap between the 1% and the 99% they govern. The charismatic chief operating officer of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, captured this in introducing Gbowee on Wednesday night when she said: \"If the central moral imperative of the 19th century was slavery and of the 20th, totalitarianism, the central moral imperative of our time is the equality of girls and women around the world.\" There is evidence that investing in girls and women in developing countries does have a dramatic impact on the economy. Cherie Blair, who set up a foundation for women, says the issue is the most important one on the Davos agenda: \"I don't think the people who go to Davos deny that this is a major issue \u2026 They read the same reports about the value of investing in women in terms of education and employment as I do.\" Various studies suggest greater involvement by the poorest and the wealthiest women could help the global economy. The World Food Programme has found that girls and women reinvest 90% of each dollar in their families by buying food, books and medicine, for example. For men, that figure is more like 30% to 40%. So, if participation at the most senior levels is to be encouraged, what is being done about it? A private breakfast of the forum's female leaders and gender parity board on Wednesday discussed a document due to be published in March which will set out best practices to achieve greater diversity. These include a focus on measurement and audit, mentoring and sponsorship and a change to the way home and work life is shared. None of these are mandatory although an appearance by Viviane Reding, who is considering the introduction of quotas across the eurozone, is keenly anticipated on Friday. Advocates of change insist that most effort should be directed at the middle management level, the point at which most women fall by the wayside, victims of either family-unfriendly policies or the failure to network for the top jobs. The forum's effort to help involves an outfit called the Young Global Leaders, a network of about 1,000 people who are picked for greatness before the age of 40. Of these, 42% of these are women, while the newly formed Global Shapers of over-achievers under 30 are split 50/50. The big question is, how many of these graduate to actually run companies or countries? WEF doesn't give out these figures. However, its efforts to become more inclusive does seem to have led to a marked cultural shift. Anuradha Vittachi, who has been attending Davos for years as founder of the OneWorld development group, says: \"The panel used to look at the brown female wearing a sari with her hand up and point to someone else in the audience to ask a question.\" That is no longer the case, she acknowledges. Blair says: \"If the world doesn't start giving a proper platform for women, then it will fall flat on its face.\" Clark agrees. Asked whether leaders are paying lip service to gender equality as they battle to put out the global economic fires, she says: \"Maybe, but we can't let them off the hook. We just have to keep on keeping on.\"",

      "body": "<p>Royal Bank of Scotland stoked a political row on Thursday night after it announced it had awarded its chief executive, Stephen Hester, a bonus worth almost \u00a31m.</p> <p>The payment was derided as \"utterly unacceptable\" by one Liberal Democrat peer, while a Foreign Office minister calculated that Hester's package meant he was paid in three days what a soldier in Afghanistan, \"risking his life\", earned in a whole year.</p> <p>The bailed-out bank attempted to justify the bonus \u2013 which is being paid in shares that Hester will be able to gain access to in 2014 \u2013 by saying it needed to reward the chief executive for the progress he had made in reducing the size of RBS.</p> <p>Since he joined in November 2008, the bank has cut 33,000 jobs.</p> <p>The bank also stressed that a bonus Hester had been awarded when he joined shortly after the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008 \u2013 worth \u00a36.4m at the time \u2013 and which would have paid out this year, was now worthless.</p> <p>Sir Philip Hampton, the RBS chairman, said tonight: \"The board is aware of the difficulties in trying to reconcile the competing objectives of all our stakeholders. This is especially true on the issue of pay.\"</p> <p>Hampton will also not receive shares that he was awarded when he joined in 2009 after the bailout.</p> <p>He said Hester's bonus \u2013 which is 60% of the maximum and will involve the award of 3.6m shares \u2013 was being granted as it \"reflects progress in the categories agreed with our shareholders as set out in the remuneration report\". The 3.6m shares are currently worth \u00a3963,000 and could rise or fall in value by 2014.</p> <p>Hampton added: \"His pay is strongly geared to the recovery of RBS, which he was recruited to turn around, having played no part in its collapse.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland stoked a political row on Thursday night after it announced it had awarded its chief executive, Stephen Hester, a bonus worth almost \u00a31m. The payment was derided as \"utterly unacceptable\" by one Liberal Democrat peer, while a Foreign Office minister calculated that Hester's package meant he was paid in three days what a soldier in Afghanistan, \"risking his life\", earned in a whole year. The bailed-out bank attempted to justify the bonus \u2013 which is being paid in shares that Hester will be able to gain access to in 2014 \u2013 by saying it needed to reward the chief executive for the progress he had made in reducing the size of RBS. Since he joined in November 2008, the bank has cut 33,000 jobs. The bank also stressed that a bonus Hester had been awarded when he joined shortly after the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008 \u2013 worth \u00a36.4m at the time \u2013 and which would have paid out this year, was now worthless. Sir Philip Hampton, the RBS chairman, said tonight: \"The board is aware of the difficulties in trying to reconcile the competing objectives of all our stakeholders. This is especially true on the issue of pay.\" Hampton will also not receive shares that he was awarded when he joined in 2009 after the bailout. He said Hester's bonus \u2013 which is 60% of the maximum and will involve the award of 3.6m shares \u2013 was being granted as it \"reflects progress in the categories agreed with our shareholders as set out in the remuneration report\". The 3.6m shares are currently worth \u00a3963,000 and could rise or fall in value by 2014. Hampton added: \"His pay is strongly geared to the recovery of RBS, which he was recruited to turn around, having played no part in its collapse. The priority is to reshape a business that was far too big and far too risky, reducing legacy losses whilst improving performance in the group's strong core businesses.\" Hampton argued that a \"safer and more valuable RBS is in the interests of our customers, shareholders and the UK economy\". The size of Hester's bonus sparked a wave of criticism and calls for him not to accept the money. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat peer who resigned as a Treasury spokesman for his party a year ago over the lax treatment of the financial sector by the coalition, said the bank should realise that any bonus for Hester this year was \"utterly unacceptable\". Oakeshott is concerned about the slow flow of lending to small businesses, which the major banks, including RBS, committed to last year under the Project Merlin agreement. \"The bonus would be a reward for RBS's failure to lend to small business which was the key target,\" he said. Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne, speaking on BBC1's Question Time, said that Hester should decline the bonus as \"a question of honour\". \"Even if there is a contractual opportunity for him to have it, it doesn't mean he has to accept it. He's already being paid more than \u00a31m a year. \"His total package now means he gets paid in about three days what a soldier serving in Afghanistan, risking his life, gets in a whole year. I think he should reflect on that,\" the Liberal Democrat MP said. Chris Leslie, Labour's shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Nobody doubts that Stephen Hester has done some important things at RBS, but what this award shows is David Cameron's promises about reining in excessive bonuses at state-owned banks or using shareholder power have proved to be utterly worthless. \"Indeed, anyone who thinks it is acceptable to award a bonus of almost \u00a31m on top of a basic salary of \u00a31.2m in these tough times is desperately out of touch with millions of people who are struggling to make ends meet.\" \"Instead of fiddling at the margins of this issue, David Cameron should take proper action on excessive executive pay as well as agree to Labour's call for a new tax on bankers' bonuses this year to fund 100,000 jobs for young people.\" A Conservative Party spokesman said: \"This is a bit rich from Labour given that they completely failed to do anything to curb multimillion-pound bonuses during their time in government \u2013 which was when the worst excesses of the City occurred.

Bob Diamond, boss of Barclays, could receive a share award worth nearly \u00a310m. Antonio Horta-Osorio, chief executive of part-nationalised Lloyds Banking Group, announced he would forgo his annual bonus of up to \u00a32.4m following his two-month leave of absence due to exhaustion. It was unclear whether or not John Hourican, the boss of the RBS investment banking arm, would meet the performance criteria for him to receive shares worth up to \u00a34m in April. The row over Hester's bonus comes just days after the business secretary, Vince Cable, announced new proposals to crack down on excessive pay by giving shareholders a binding vote on executive pay deals.
