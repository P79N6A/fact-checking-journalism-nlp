Ian Livingston, 48, says he has already been \"well rewarded\" during more than a decade as director of one of the biggest companies on the stock market. Livingston, who will take a seat in the House of Lords, is a surprise replacement for the former HSBC chairman Lord Green, who quit the bank to join the coalition in 2011 and is approaching retirement. In the last months in his role, Green has faced repeated questions about what he knew about US Senate revelations that HSBC branches were used to launder money for drug cartels and pariah states \u2013 activity which led to a record \u00a31.2bn fine for the bank.

His departure comes ahead of the publication next month of a National Audit Office report which is expected to raise questions about the process which has seen BT win every contract so far awarded to extend Britain's broadband network into rural areas. Over the last five years, Livingston has transformed the former national telecoms monopoly by tackling its towering pension fund deficit and curbing losses at its global services division.

So \"pharmakon\" is what the Federal Reserve is to the markets: for the stock markets, the bond markets, the markets for government-supported mortgages, the Fed is both the poison and the medicine.</p> <p>The Fed cured them of their ills. It helped pull those markets out of their doldrums in 2009. The central bank was so good at its job that the Fed is now essentially a market participant itself, influencing the prices in all those markets. As noted <a href=\"http://www.peakprosperity.com/\">economic researcher Chris Martenson</a> observed:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Fed's [market] activities were designed to directly influence the eagerness of parties to buy stocks and bonds because they know the Fed is there buying right alongside them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's not just stocks and bonds. Have you seen the price of your house rise recently? Thank the Fed.</p> <p>The housing recovery we all take for granted now is based, in part, on the Fed's actions. The Federal Reserve buys $45bn a month of mortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed by two government agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Then, the mortgage-backed securities are sold to buyers, including banks and, since 2009, the Federal Reserve.&#xa0;</p> <p>There is nothing that causes banks to write mortgages to be written faster than knowing that they have a guaranteed buyer for the final product. The Federal Reserve is that buyer. As long as the Fed keeps buying mortgages, it provides a thick, comfortable net for the ongoing high-wire act of the housing recovery.&#xa0;</p> <p>So there's no clear rationale for why the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/19/federal-reserve-interest-rates-stimulus\">markets reacted so badly to the Federal Reserve's statement</a> \u2013 except for one possibility: that investors fear that the Fed will eventually stop buying government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, leaving the bond markets and the mortgage markets to fend for themselves after years of support.&#xa0;</p> <p>They have a right to worry. The Fed is juggling quite a few jobs. Not only is it balancing the markets, it is also&#xa0;the only institution taking any kind of consistent action to improve the economy. We <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/23/ben-bernanke-corporate-america-not-doing-job\">have an&#xa0;ineffectual Congress and milquetoast corporate CEOs</a>, who are not stepping up to the plate to improve the unemployment situation or investing in America. They're waiting for someone else to come up with ideas and fix the problem of the economy, then, presumably, they will pitch in.</p> <p>That <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/20/ben-bernanke-unlikely-atlas-us-economy\">leaves the Fed to fix everything</a> we want fixed: housing, unemployment and inflation (whether too high or too low).</p> <p>What almost all Americans want to know is when jobs will be plentiful again, or what hope they may have of seeing their paychecks rise. Those are economic issues, not market issues. Yet, in a bizarre twist, those very concrete results in the economy depend on the Federal Reserve's relationship with the markets.</p> <p>The Fed fixes most of those things, these days, by using the markets. It sets interest rates low in the hopes that government bonds will be an unprofitable investment, which would push people to buy corporate bonds, which in turn would encourage corporations to invest the extra money. (That, so far, has not worked out so well. It has also punished people who save money in bank accounts, which pay nearly no interest right now). The Fed bought mortgage-backed securities first to allow banks to unload their toxic junk, and now to encourage the housing recovery. The markets need the Fed and they hate that they need the Fed.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's not just that the markets need the Fed. The Fed also needs the markets. The markets signal confidence, which is the most important product the Federal Reserve is selling. If the markets are buying that confidence, the Fed's job is that much easier. Explaining Wednesday's market scowl at the Fed's actions, for instance, economist Paul Edelstein of <a href=\"http://www.ihs.com/index.aspx\">IHS Global Insight</a> wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Markets have learned that the Fed is chronically optimistic and aren't buying the upbeat view.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Like bickering spouses in a long-term marriage, the Fed and the markets know each other too well. But both sides of this relationship are often fickle. The Fed changes its policies, and the market changes its sentiments. Neither can fully trust the other.</p> <p>This thorny relationship between the markets and the Fed \u2013 \"I love you! Now go away!\" \u2013 is becoming more important as the economy continues to eke out a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/29/economic-recovery-not-real\">recovery, albeit weak and overhyped</a>. And Wednesday, the Fed said that it expects the economy to strengthen.</p> <p>It is likely wrong about that. The Federal Reserve is not actually particularly good at predicting what the economy will be like \u2013 a point made robustly by Wall Street Journal reporter Jon Hilsenrath at the press conference. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, had no choice but to agree with him.</p> <p>It's significant that high unemployment was in the second line of the Federal Reserve's official release: high up, where it needed the emphasis. During the press conference, Bernanke talked about the problematic labor-force participation rate, which indicates people are dropping out of the job market even as the official rate of unemployment falls.</p> <p>Predicting the economy is a shot in the dark for anyone, including the Federal Reserve. But it has been incorrectly bullish for too long. For the Fed to know whether to continue buying securities, it wants to see the economy improve. It doesn't know if it will.</p> <p>\"We have no deterministic or fixed plan,\" Bernanke said Wednesday. At most, he suggested that the Fed would wind down purchases starting later this year, and maybe end them next year. Then again, he said, maybe not; the recovery might not be strong enough. Shrug. Play again, next time.</p> <p>It actually used to be in Bernanke's interest to be vague \u2013 when he was too specific, the markets freaked out and threatened to undo some of the benefits he brought to them \u2013&#xa0;but that ship has sailed. Bernanke has committed himself to transparency, more so than any of his predecessors. He wants to speak plainly.</p> <p>Unfortunately, he is still hostage to market expectations. That's one central tendency that won't change as long as Bernanke stays in his seat. Ben Bernanke's Federal Reserve: \"<em>pharmakon</em>\" to the markets.</p>",

Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, had no choice but to agree with him. It's significant that high unemployment was in the second line of the Federal Reserve's official release: high up, where it needed the emphasis. During the press conference, Bernanke talked about the problematic labor-force participation rate, which indicates people are dropping out of the job market even as the official rate of unemployment falls. Predicting the economy is a shot in the dark for anyone, including the Federal Reserve. But it has been incorrectly bullish for too long. For the Fed to know whether to continue buying securities, it wants to see the economy improve. It doesn't know if it will. \"We have no deterministic or fixed plan,\" Bernanke said Wednesday. At most, he suggested that the Fed would wind down purchases starting later this year, and maybe end them next year. Then again, he said, maybe not; the recovery might not be strong enough. Shrug. Play again, next time. It actually used to be in Bernanke's interest to be vague \u2013 when he was too specific, the markets freaked out and threatened to undo some of the benefits he brought to them \u2013 but that ship has sailed. Bernanke has committed himself to transparency, more so than any of his predecessors. He wants to speak plainly. Unfortunately, he is still hostage to market expectations. That's one central tendency that won't change as long as Bernanke stays in his seat. Ben Bernanke's Federal Reserve: \"pharmakon\" to the markets.",

      "bodyText": "The next government will have to increase the pace of spending cuts by 50% in the two years after the 2015 election if it is to meet the current deficit target, new research by the Resolution Foundation thinktank shows. The report finds that if the next government decides instead to stick with the current \u2013 already punishing \u2013 pace of cuts, the deficit target will only be met by raising taxes by \u00a310bn or finding further welfare cuts. The stark message shows the scale of the spending challenge facing all parties after the election, and the pressure they will face to come clean with the electorate about their plans. On the assumption that taxes are not increased, welfare spending is maintained at current levels and key departments such as health and aid remain protected from cuts, some departments will face crippling demands to cut spending. The Resolution Foundation calculates that by 2017-18, the final planned year of cuts, the Foreign Office will have had its budget cut by 64% from the baseline of 2010-11, the first year of coalition cuts.

Speculation is mounting that a partial sell-off of the state's Lloyds stake could take place within months.</p> <p>But he played down expectations of an immediate \"Tell Sid\" style privatisation, as implemented by the Conservatives during the 1980s.</p> </blockquote> <p>While Nils Pratley argues that the chancellor's change of heart on RBS, although somewhat baffling, is sensible:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The mystery deepens. Last week it was imperative that Stephen Hester be hustled out of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup\">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> because the Treasury wanted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/privatisation\">privatisation</a> to happen by the end of 2014 and to give a new chief executive time to settle in.</p> <p>This week, however, a rapid sale of shares is not a priority. Instead, as chancellor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> announced, the option of a good bank/bad bank split at RBS will be examined in detail. In any case, privatisation of RBS is \"some way off\", said Osborne, and Lloyds is top of the batting order for a sale of shares.</p> <p>What on earth is going on? Well, one thing is clear: the assembled forces of Lord Lawson and other members of the Banking Commission, the governor of the Bank of England, and business secretary Vince Cable have scored a notable victory.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's Nils's full comment: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/jun/19/rbs-privatisation-osborne-banking-commission\">George Osborne's shift on bad bank model is welcome</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51c20ec8e4b0b44ffcfb9937\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-19T20:12:01.997Z\">9.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street down</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Wall Street has closed for the day with the Dow Jones falling 206 points, or 1.35%, to 15112.</strong></p> <p>Ben Bernanke's prediction that the Fed's asset purchase scheme will start to slow this year, and end by the middle of 2014, has not gone down terribly well in New York.</p> <p>Still, it's far from a rout.

This is a soothing release; designed to say that the tapering away of asset purchases will come but they are wary of scaring the horses</p> <p>The balancing act in the data revisions comes down on the side of tapering sooner rather than later given growth is roughly the same as in the March meeting and unemployment is towards the lower side of March expectations too.</p> <p>The key will be inflation. The Fed\u2019s stock measure of inflation (Personal Consumption Expenditure) only rose 0.7% through the year to April, less than half the bank\u2019s target. While we think that the risk of deflation in the US is low, we also believe that the Fed will continue asset purchases at the current rate through until the end of the year.</p> <p>The Fed expects these measures to remain muted through 2014.</p> <p>I am slightly away from the market\u2019s expectations in that I believe that the Fed will not \u2018taper\u2019 away its asset purchases until next year. The basis of this is the Fed\u2019s determination to make sure that the recovery in the US jobs market is sustainable.

Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.</p> <p>Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.</p> <p>To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.</p> <p>The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.</p> <p>To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.</p> <p>Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was James Bullard, who believed that the Committee should signal more strongly its willingness to defend its inflation goal in light of recent low inflation readings, and Esther L. George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations.\"</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51c1f311e4b03fd05241adeb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-19T18:06:09.593Z\">7.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FED DECISION</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Federal Reserve's statement is out -- the FOMC has voted to leave its QE programme unchanged at $85bn per month, although two members have dissented.</strong></p> <p>The Fed also stated that \"downside risks\" to the economy and the labour market have diminished 'since the Fall', with improvements to the employment sector in recen months.</p> <p>It also reiterated to keep monetary policy at its current loose levels until the jobless rate has dropped below 6.5%.</p> <p>Here's the Reuters snaps:</p> <ul> <li>FED REPEATS WILL BUY LONGER-TERM TREASURY SECURITIES AT PACE OF $45bn A MONTH, AGENCY MBS AT $40bn A MONTH FED SAYS DOWNSIDE RISKS TO OUTLOOK FOR ECONOMY AND LABOR MARKET HAVE DIMINISHED SINCE THE FALL</li> <li>FED VOTE IN FAVOR OF POLICY WAS 10-2; BULLARD DISSENTED, CITING RECENT LOW INFLATION READINGS; GEORGE DISSENTED, REPEATING CONCERNS OF FUTURE IMBALANCES</li> <li>FED SAYS LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE SHOWN FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN RECENT MONTHS, BUT JOBLESS RATE REMAINS ELEVATED</li> <li>FED SAYS INFLATION HAS BEEN RUNNING BELOW TARGET, PARTLY REFLECTING TRANSITORY INFLUENCES; LONG-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS STABLE</li> <li>FED-TO KEEP FED FUNDS RATE 0-0.25% AS LONG AS JOBLESS RATE ABOVE 6.5%, 1-2 YEAR PROJECTED INFLATION NO MORE THAN 2.5%, LONGER-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS WELL ANCHORED&#xa0;</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-13fc855d-e50e-4e64-b4e1-88f00133f8e3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/19/1371664903942/6f3931f4-01e2-4f0b-a26e-18f8c0c1f8ec-460x337.jpeg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke testifies before the Joint Economic Committee in Washington in this May 22, 2013 file photo.\" width=\"460\" height=\"337\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke.

Specifically, the letter says:</p> <p>\u201cIn response to Peter Spiegel\u2019s article in the Financial Times issue of June 18, regarding President Anastasiades\u2019 letter to the European leaders last week, I would like to offer the following clarifications.</p> <p>The letter of President Anastasiades in no way aimed at a reversal of the memorandum of understanding (MoU), as the article reports.</p> <p>As has been favourably observed by the EU institutions, Cyprus, in fact, applied most of the terms of the memorandum, even before the agreement was signed and sealed. Allow me to clarify that the Government is fully committed to implement all the provisions of the MoU, with the aim of achieving its objectives.</p> <p>Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that it is not true to state, as reported in the said article, that failure to adequately prepare for the bailout impact is partly the Anastasiades\u2019 government\u2019s fault, which voted down the original plan, before accepting a similar deal nine days later.</p> <p>In fact, the Government did not vote down the original plan. It submitted, as it was duty bound, the deal it had reached with its European partners to the Cyprus House of Representatives and it is the House that voted against it, in the first instance.</p> <p>The objective of the President\u2019s intervention was to bring to the attention of our European partners important issues, that are inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of the MoU and initiate a dialogue with a view to finding the best way forward.</p> <p>I reiterate once again that the Cyprus government is fully committed to applying the terms of the memorandum and has already embarked on that road, because it is convinced that the full and transparent implementation of the agreement is the only way the economic challenges can be addressed There is no attempt to renegotiate the MoU.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-06-19T17:09:27.792Z\">at 6.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51c1da1ce4b008603b2708d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-19T16:19:41.009Z\">5.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>While we wait for anything official from Athens following today's meeting of coalition leaders, here's an interesting piece on RadioBubble about the closure of Greek state broadcaster ERT:</p> <p><a href=\"http://international.radiobubble.gr/2013/06/truths-and-lies-about-ert-former-news.html\">Truths and lies about ERT: A former news director answers the Prime Minister's claims</a></p> <p>It points out that Antonis Samaras, who has accused ERT of corruption and cronyism, actually made several senior appointments to the organisation.

Instead, they have been looking to extract certain concessions. Venizelos wants a cabinet reshuffle to actually increase his party's participation and visibility in the government (his original strategy was to shadow the government in case things went wrong; however, as the program has performed Samaras has been swallowing all of the credit).</p> <p>In terms of specifics, the current speculation is that PASOK is targeting the ministry of administrative reform as well as some deputy minister positions in the health and labour ministries. Likewise Kouvelis does not object to a reshuffle. Venizelos's and Kouvelis also keep repeating their desire for a renewal of the government's agreement and better \"coordination of the government\". In the aggregate, these statements should be interpreted as a warning to Samaras that he cannot decide on big policy issues without more active involvement and agreement of the coalition heads.</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, the latest opinion polls show that Pasok and Democratic Left would be big losers if an election was held soon. Both are currently polling around the 4-7% mark, compared to New Democracy at 29-30%.</p> <p>Rahman adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Samaras personally comes in around 43% compared to Syriza's Tsipras at 37%, depending upon the poll).

Most US economists expect the Fed to start reducing its monthly bond purchases later this year, but the wider market view is much more mixed and there are plenty who expect the FOMC to put enough criteria in the way of tapering, to calm markets.</p> <p>The next leg of a summer of market volatility is likely to start in the days ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jane Foley</strong> of <strong>Rabobank</strong> points out that Bernanke brought the attention on himself. The weak US labour market means the Fed's unlikely to 'taper' its bond-buying programme tonight, she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since Bernanke uttered the words on May 22 that the Fed could start to taper QE \u201cat the next few meetings\u201d, the markets have been focussed on the outcome of today\u2019s FOMC decision at 19:00 BST and the press conference that will follow 30 minutes later. Insofar as Bernanke is unlikely to contradict himself, it is likely that the Fed President will reiterate his warnings that the Fed could start to taper QE in the foreseeable future. However, we do not expect this to happen before the turn of the year.&#xa0;</p> <p>The US unemployment rate currently stands at 7.6%. This is significantly below the 10% high registered in 2009. However, the US labour market has a long way to go before it can claim to have returned to pre-crisis levels. The labour force participation rate has only just come off a 37 year low. This suggests that the headline unemployment rate is understating the actual levels of joblessness and underemployment in the economy, potentially by a large margin.</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JekE9h7mADU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JekE9h7mADU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>RanSquawk's FOMC preview</figcaption> </figure>   <p>And <strong>Ransquawk</strong> predicts that the Fed will reiterate that it expects to maintain exceptionally low rates until mid-2015 or until the unemployment rate reaches 6.5%.</p> <p>More in their video preview above, which explains how traders will be looking for any signs that Bernanke has turned more hawkish.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51c18afbe4b0738d4780561a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-19T10:42:12.761Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The FT's James Mackintosh, though, reckons our bankers could even turn the threat of jail to their advantage:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jmackin2/statuses/347301595890987008\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Jailing &quot;reckless&quot; bankers as proposed in UK surely means they will demand higher pay as compensation for the risk of prison.</p>&mdash; James Mackintosh (@jmackin2) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jmackin2/statuses/347301595890987008\">June 19, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51c184d6e4b06cb77792c29a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-06-19T10:15:50.414Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Should bankers be jailed?

The minority voting for more QE thought the case for more stimulus remained compelling and the economic outlook was no stronger than it was in May.</p> <p>It seems clear that both Fisher and Miles will continue to vote for more QE when Carney takes over next month.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Howard Archer</strong> of <strong>IHS Global Insight</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We now move to the Carney era at the Bank of England, and he will no doubt be relieved to see the economy looking a bit perkier as he takes up the reins.</p> <p>Indeed, with the economy currently showing signs of widespread improvement, pressure on Carney to take immediate action has receded thereby giving him more time to take full stock of the situation from within the Bank of England and to establish his working relationship with the rest of the MPC.</p> <p>\"We believe it is unlikely that any major policy action will occur at the July MPC meeting, especially as the committee will be getting the Bank of England\u2019s new growth and inflation forecasts at the August meeting.</p> <p>While we do not expect any action from the Bank of England in July, we believe further Quantitative Easing is still very possible further out.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here's more reaction:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/joelhillssky/statuses/347279672691798017\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Sir Mervyn King&#39;s parting comment as Bank Governor: &quot;the recovery is in sight&quot;.

Thanks, and goodnight. GW Here's our full story on the Mansion House speech, by my colleagues Jill Treanor and Nick Watt: George Osborne readies City for Lloyds sell-off George Osborne has signalled he is ready to start the sell-off of the taxpayer's stake in Lloyds Banking Group, but said he is to consider whether to break up the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a move that could delay the bailed out bank's return to the private sector. In his annual speech to City grandees at Mansion House on Wednesday night, the chancellor said he was \"actively considering options for share sales in Lloyds\", in which the government has a 39% stake. Speculation is mounting that a partial sell-off of the state's Lloyds stake could take place within months. But he played down expectations of an immediate \"Tell Sid\" style privatisation, as implemented by the Conservatives during the 1980s. While Nils Pratley argues that the chancellor's change of heart on RBS, although somewhat baffling, is sensible: The mystery deepens. Last week it was imperative that Stephen Hester be hustled out of Royal Bank of Scotland because the Treasury wanted privatisation to happen by the end of 2014 and to give a new chief executive time to settle in. This week, however, a rapid sale of shares is not a priority. Instead, as chancellor George Osborne announced, the option of a good bank/bad bank split at RBS will be examined in detail. In any case, privatisation of RBS is \"some way off\", said Osborne, and Lloyds is top of the batting order for a sale of shares. What on earth is going on? Well, one thing is clear: the assembled forces of Lord Lawson and other members of the Banking Commission, the governor of the Bank of England, and business secretary Vince Cable have scored a notable victory. Here's Nils's full comment: George Osborne's shift on bad bank model is welcome Wall Street has closed for the day with the Dow Jones falling 206 points, or 1.35%, to 15112. Ben Bernanke's prediction that the Fed's asset purchase scheme will start to slow this year, and end by the middle of 2014, has not gone down terribly well in New York. Still, it's far from a rout. And the key to exiting this crisis will be how the process of tapering is managed, rather than exactly when it starts and finished. That's the 'landing on an aircraft carrier' analogy which the Fed chair made today. Not that everyone took it totally seriously: Sir Mervyn King is also speaking at the Mansion House -- in a speech called A Governor looks back \u2013 and forward. It includes the traditional sporting allusion: I shall not detain you this evening with a retrospective examination of my time as Governor. Suffice it to say that it was a game of two halves. And, far from a boring goalless draw, it turned out to be a rather exciting and dramatic game, full of incident, with a red card or two and a passionate and at times justifiably angry crowd. We shall have to wait for the historians of tomorrow to file the full match report. The full speech is online here. And lo, the day ends with the Mansion House speeches in London. The great and the good (and the rest) of Britain's financial world are gathered for the annual black tie event. And the big news tonight is that George Osborne is announcing that he will review whether to break up Royal Bank of Scotland. He's also announcing that the government is \"actively considering\" returning Lloyds Banking Group to the private sector. Osborne is declaring: Nothing better signals Britain's move from rescue to recovery than the fact that we can start to plan for our exit from government share ownership of our biggest banks. Our banking expert Jill Treanor sums it up: Some late news in the UK -- Sir Mervyn King is getting a peerage in recognition of his loyal service at the Bank of England Kit Juckes of SocGen comments: Bottom line - no backing down, no turning back, the Fed will taper unless the data deteriorate. Kit also provides a copy of the key quote from Bernanke - on when asset purchases might slow, and then stop. If the incoming data are broadly consistent with this forecast, the Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to moderate the monthly pace of purchases later this year. And if the subsequent data remain broadly aligned with our current expectations for the economy, we would continue to reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases around midyear. In this scenario, when asset purchases ultimately come to an end, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7%, with solid economic growth supporting further job gains, a substantial improvement from the 8.1% unemployment rate that prevailed when the committee announced this program. I would like to emphasize once more the point that our policy is in no way predetermined and will depend on the incoming data and the evolution of the outlook as well as on the cumulative progress toward our objectives. Here's a natty screengrab from Bloomberg, showing how volatility fluctuated through Bernanke's press conference as traders tried to work out what it means: And Bernanke's press conference is over. Asked about Japan's stimulus programme, Ben Bernanke says he supports it - and prime minister Shinzo Abe's Three Arrow approach to reviving the economy. The Bank of Japan needs to be very aggressive to tackle deflation, he says, and is also correct to be targetting fiscal and structural issues. I support what Japan is doing, he adds, even if it has some effects on our economy, Bernanke adds. Quantitative easing is often blamed for pushing up the price of commodities, but Bernanke says he's not seen much evidence that the current US stimulus programme has had an effect. He cited weaknesses in Europe's economy as one factor. And on the labour market, the Fed chair sais that weak rises in wages is proof that the US unemployment rate is too high (as workers are in a poor bargaining position). Bernanke also denies that the Fed isn't worried about inflation falling below its target (US CPI came in at 1.4% yesterday). Inflation that is too low is a problem, he says - it's 'entirely wrong' to say the Fed isn't concerned about this risk. Wall Street's looking less-and-less impressed by Bernanke's comments, and the prospect of tapering begining later this year. The Dow is now down 158 points, or just over 1%, at 15158. Bernanke also refused to reveal why he won't be attending the Jackson Hole symposium this summer -- the central bankers shindig of choice. He points out that he's been to the event many times -- so what's the problem with attending different events instead? Two personal questions in one press conference.....Bernanke's future risks becoming the story. While the Federal Reserve was capturing our attention, the meeting between the three leaders of Greece's government broke up. And Evangelos Venizelos, head of the left-wing Pasok party, has announced that another round of talks will take place on Thursday night, from 8.30pm local time (6.30pm BST). From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Mega TV interrupted its news programme to say that the talks have ended but that prime minister Antonis Samaras will not be making statements (as had been hoped). His partners, socialist Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos and Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvellis will make statements however. Doesn't sound like relations between the three men are fully repaired, following the row ove the closure of Greece's state broadcaster. Bernanke says he hopes for more progress on implementing new rules on the financial sector, but argues that US banks are already being strengthened \"as the rules are finalised\". He said: We are not ignoring the health and safety of the banking sector. The amount of capital held by banks has almost doubled. A few more key quotes from Bernanke: Bernanke, whose term of office ends in early 2014, also declines to answer a question about his future. I'm here to talk about policy, not personal matters, he smiles. Should we be worried about recent rises in interest rates on US government bonds? No says Bernanke -- it's a sign of optimism in the US economy. Question time. Hasn't the Fed got its forecasts too optimistic in the past, so how can we be sure it's right to be considering tapering later this year? Bernanke responds that \"Fundamentals look a little better\", especially in the housing market. But if the US economy falters, asset purchases will continue for longer, he says. Next Key Point: If the Fed's economic forecasts are correct, then the committee expects to start slowing its asset purchases scheme this year. And it would probably end the scheme by the middle of 2014. Bernanke also told his press conference that the US jobless rate will probably be around 7% when the slowing process begins ends. That slowing process will be 'gradual'. Bernanke also insists that slowing asset purchases should not stun the US economy. He describes it as: Letting up the bit on the gas pedal as the car picks up speed, not pressing on the brake. IUsing the brakes, by raising rates, is still far in the future, he adds. Interesting. Bernanke tells his press conference that \"a strong majority\" of members of the Fed's Open Marcket Committee believe that it will not sell mortgage-backed securities acquired during its QE programme \"during the process of normalising policy\". The Fed is currently buying $40bn of MBSs, and $45bn of Treasury bonds, each month. We're not getting more information now, though, with Bernanke insisting that the Fed will continue to support the US economy even as the labour market and economic growth picks up. Bernanke is starting his press conference by reading out a statement, similar to the one released at 7pm BST (2pm EDT), and explaining the new economic forecasts. The Federal Reserve chairman's press conference is upon us - you can watch it in this livestream: Here's some early reaction to the Fed's statement, from Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First foreign exchange said: We\u2019ve seen a fairly muted response to the Fed decision so far but, on balance, it looks like this is a meeting that was taken with the very real knowledge that markets have been spooked of late by what the central bank could be up to. This is a soothing release; designed to say that the tapering away of asset purchases will come but they are wary of scaring the horses The balancing act in the data revisions comes down on the side of tapering sooner rather than later given growth is roughly the same as in the March meeting and unemployment is towards the lower side of March expectations too. The key will be inflation. The Fed\u2019s stock measure of inflation (Personal Consumption Expenditure) only rose 0.7% through the year to April, less than half the bank\u2019s target. While we think that the risk of deflation in the US is low, we also believe that the Fed will continue asset purchases at the current rate through until the end of the year. The Fed expects these measures to remain muted through 2014. I am slightly away from the market\u2019s expectations in that I believe that the Fed will not \u2018taper\u2019 away its asset purchases until next year. The basis of this is the Fed\u2019s determination to make sure that the recovery in the US jobs market is sustainable. The latest numbers from the US jobs market have simply not been good enough in my eyes; additions to payrolls have not been above trend regularly and the unemployment rate is not improving consistently. Fold in the likelihood that the world economy is likely to remain in a below trend growth cycle through Q3 and I would think that the Federal Reserve will err on the side of caution; especially as inflation expectations remain so firmly anchored. Handy: Clearer version in the Fed's release (pdf). US government bonds have fallen in value since the Fed's statement was released, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on the debt. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has jumped to 2.27%, from 2.18% this morning, a move of 9 basis points (that's a significant shift for Treasuries). That shows traders are anticipating an earlier 'tapering' of the Fed's bond-buying programme, despite it holding it unchanged at today's meeting. Not much reaction in the stock market, though, with the Dow Jones down just 35 points. The Federal Reserve has also released its new economic forecasts. They show that it now expects the US jobless rate to be lower next year than three months ago. They're online here. The Fed nowe expects the unemployment rate to be between 6.5% to 6.8% in 2014, down from 6.7% to 7% in March. With 6.5% seen as the crucial target for the Fed before it starts to tighten monetary policy, this suggests the end of ultra-lose monetary policy may be closer than previously thought.... Here's the full statement released by the Federal Reserve: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A. Duke; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. Yellen. Voting against the action was James Bullard, who believed that the Committee should signal more strongly its willingness to defend its inflation goal in light of recent low inflation readings, and Esther L. George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations.\" The Federal Reserve's statement is out -- the FOMC has voted to leave its QE programme unchanged at $85bn per month, although two members have dissented. The Fed also stated that \"downside risks\" to the economy and the labour market have diminished 'since the Fall', with improvements to the employment sector in recen months. It also reiterated to keep monetary policy at its current loose levels until the jobless rate has dropped below 6.5%. Here's the Reuters snaps: FED REPEATS WILL BUY LONGER-TERM TREASURY SECURITIES AT PACE OF $45bn A MONTH, AGENCY MBS AT $40bn A MONTH FED SAYS DOWNSIDE RISKS TO OUTLOOK FOR ECONOMY AND LABOR MARKET HAVE DIMINISHED SINCE THE FALL FED VOTE IN FAVOR OF POLICY WAS 10-2; BULLARD DISSENTED, CITING RECENT LOW INFLATION READINGS; GEORGE DISSENTED, REPEATING CONCERNS OF FUTURE IMBALANCES FED SAYS LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE SHOWN FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN RECENT MONTHS, BUT JOBLESS RATE REMAINS ELEVATED FED SAYS INFLATION HAS BEEN RUNNING BELOW TARGET, PARTLY REFLECTING TRANSITORY INFLUENCES; LONG-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS STABLE FED-TO KEEP FED FUNDS RATE 0-0.25% AS LONG AS JOBLESS RATE ABOVE 6.5%, 1-2 YEAR PROJECTED INFLATION NO MORE THAN 2.5%, LONGER-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS WELL ANCHORED Just a couple of minutes until the Federal Reserve's decision on US monetary policy, and updated economic forecasts. Analysts and traders will be looking to see if the Fed has actually slowed its stimulus package (currently running at $85bn of bond purchases), and for any changes to the wording of its statement. Its new economic forecasts will be scrutinised for any changes to its growth and employment predictions. That could show whether the US central bank is closer, or further away, from slowing its quantitative easing programme. In other euro crisis news, Silvio Berlusconi has vowed to keep supporting Italy's coalition government despite losing his bid to block his tax fraud conviction, from last October. In a statement, Berlusconi said: Today's constitutional court decision, which goes against common sense and all the preceding jurisprudence made by the very same court, will not have any influence on my personal commitment to support the government with loyalty and conviction. The decision means the original judges who convicted the former prime minister eight months ago, and sentenced him to four years in prison, must now decide on his appeal. Berlusconi claims they acted unfairly by not allowing him to delay a hearing in March 2010, which he couldn't attend due to prime ministerial duties. The Cypriot government has now released its full statement denying asking for changes to its bailout programme. Prime minister Anastiades was simply trying to alert fellow leaders to the economic challenges on the island when he wrote to them last week, apparently. Here's the full statement, which comes hours after EU officials ruled out any leeway for Cyprus (see 9.25am) Clarifying letter by the Government Spokesman regarding an article in the Financial Times 19/06/2013 The Government Spokesman, Mr Christos Stylianides, sent today the following clarifying letter in relation to an article in the Financial Times entitled \u201cCyprus President calls for bailout overhaul to save economy\u201d. Specifically, the letter says: \u201cIn response to Peter Spiegel\u2019s article in the Financial Times issue of June 18, regarding President Anastasiades\u2019 letter to the European leaders last week, I would like to offer the following clarifications. The letter of President Anastasiades in no way aimed at a reversal of the memorandum of understanding (MoU), as the article reports. As has been favourably observed by the EU institutions, Cyprus, in fact, applied most of the terms of the memorandum, even before the agreement was signed and sealed. Allow me to clarify that the Government is fully committed to implement all the provisions of the MoU, with the aim of achieving its objectives. Furthermore, I would like to emphasize that it is not true to state, as reported in the said article, that failure to adequately prepare for the bailout impact is partly the Anastasiades\u2019 government\u2019s fault, which voted down the original plan, before accepting a similar deal nine days later. In fact, the Government did not vote down the original plan. It submitted, as it was duty bound, the deal it had reached with its European partners to the Cyprus House of Representatives and it is the House that voted against it, in the first instance. The objective of the President\u2019s intervention was to bring to the attention of our European partners important issues, that are inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of the MoU and initiate a dialogue with a view to finding the best way forward. I reiterate once again that the Cyprus government is fully committed to applying the terms of the memorandum and has already embarked on that road, because it is convinced that the full and transparent implementation of the agreement is the only way the economic challenges can be addressed There is no attempt to renegotiate the MoU.\u201d While we wait for anything official from Athens following today's meeting of coalition leaders, here's an interesting piece on RadioBubble about the closure of Greek state broadcaster ERT: Truths and lies about ERT: A former news director answers the Prime Minister's claims It points out that Antonis Samaras, who has accused ERT of corruption and cronyism, actually made several senior appointments to the organisation. It also suggests the PM should share some blame for its recent drop in popularity. Interesting stuff Europe's stock markets have closed, with all the major markets falling during a day spent waiting for the Fed. David Jones of IG explain: It being Fed day, investors are stuck doing their best \u2018rabbit in the headlights\u2019 impression, unable to move much for fear of being caught out. What will be, will be, and we just have to note that the Fed remains a fair distance from both its unemployment and inflation targets. Thus, despite the fairly broad improvement in the US economy, it is probably too early to take the monetary policy crutches away. And the details... the FTSE 100 inished 25 points lower at 6348. That fall of -0.4% was matched by the Geman DAX, while the French CAC shed 0.55%. Spain and Italy's main markets both closed around 1% lower. In New York, the Dow Jones is flat. Just two hours to wait for the Fed. It appears that Cyprus has written to the Financial Times to insist that it is not demanding its bailout programme is overhauled, as the paper reported on its front page this morning (see 9.25am). Via Reuters: Cyprus is fully committed to implementing an EU/IMF bailout that saved the island nation from bankruptcy and is not attempting to renegotiate its terms, the government's spokesman said on Wednesday. \"I reiterate once again that the Cyprus government is fully committed to applying the terms of the memorandum and has already embarked on that road,\" Christos Stylianides wrote in a letter to the Financial Times and circulated to media. \"There is no attempt to renegotiate (it)\". Stylianides was responding to an article in the Financial Times citing a letter Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades sent to euro zone officials criticising the bailout terms. Reuters reported the letter on June 11. Nicos Anastasiades's letter to the Troika is still online here. The key lines come at the end, with the president \"calling upon you for active and tangible support\" for its banking sector. He suggests reversing the merger of the 'good' portion of Laiki bank with Bank of Cyprus - which was a key part of the rescue programme. So Nisosia may still be 'fully commmitted' to the bailout, but it still wanted additional help.... News flashes from Cyprus on the wires \u2013 the Nicosia government pledging to stick to its bailout plans. \u2022 15:27 - CYPRUS IS \"FULLY COMMITTED\" TO APPLYING TERMS OF EU/IMF BAILOUT-GOVT SPOKESMAN \u00aa 15:28 - CYPRUS SAYS IT IS NOT ATTEMPTING TO RENEGOTIATE BAILOUT-GOVT SPOKESMAN More to follow..... And here's the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, backing the call for bank reforms: Back on the UK Banking commission...and David Cameron has told parliament that the banking reform bill going through parliament will be amended to include powers to jail bankers for reckless misconduct. The prime minister told MPs: Obviously we need to take time to read this excellent report and I commend [Andrew Tyrie] for the excellent job that he has done. But penalising, including criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly, I say yes. And also making sure that banks who are in receipt of taxpayers' money \u2013 that you can claw back bad bonuses I say yes too. That may not please the Institute of Directors. Its director of Corporate Governance and Professional Standards, Dr Roger Barker, has just claimed the idea is flawed and counterproductive: The risks associated with taking on personal liability could make it hard to recruit senior people and potentially drive up pay, which is clearly not the Commission\u2019s intention. On the other hand, any bankers who wants extra pay to compensate for the fact they might break the law should perhaps be avoided... (see 11.12am onwards for more details of the Commission report, and our reader poll) Wall Street is open, and traders are sitting on their hands while they wait for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision and updated economic forecasts in around four hours. Then the big event, Ben Bernanke's press conference, 30 minutes later. The Dow Jones is down slightly, losing just 27 points at 15291 (-0.17%), while the major European stock markets are also in the red today: The European Commission, ECB and IMF has released a pretty terse statement on their latest 'Troika' visit to Greece. Here it is in full: A mission from the EC, ECB, and IMF that has been reviewing the government's economic programme has made important progress. To allow completion of technical work, policy discussions will pause, but are expected to resume by the end of the month. That technical work means assessing exactly how well (or badly) Greece is doing meeting its bailout targets. That includes laying off thousands of civil servants this year, an area where Athens has struggled. Meanwhile in Greece, employees of state organisations who are at risk of dismissal have been demonstrating outside the Parliament in Athens today: Greece's coalition leaders are due to sit down in two hours time to discuss the way forward, following the row over state broadcaster ERT's closure. The Junior partners, Evangelos Venizelos of Pasok and Fotis Kouvelis of Democratic Left, have already held a meeting to agree a joint position ahead of their crunch talks with PM Antonis Samaras. Could the government collapse? Mujtaba Rahman, European director at Eurasia Group, reckons not. Here's highlights from Rahman's latest analyst note: Importantly, neither PASOK nor Democratic Left have threatened to leave the government. Instead, they have been looking to extract certain concessions. Venizelos wants a cabinet reshuffle to actually increase his party's participation and visibility in the government (his original strategy was to shadow the government in case things went wrong; however, as the program has performed Samaras has been swallowing all of the credit). In terms of specifics, the current speculation is that PASOK is targeting the ministry of administrative reform as well as some deputy minister positions in the health and labour ministries. Likewise Kouvelis does not object to a reshuffle. Venizelos's and Kouvelis also keep repeating their desire for a renewal of the government's agreement and better \"coordination of the government\". In the aggregate, these statements should be interpreted as a warning to Samaras that he cannot decide on big policy issues without more active involvement and agreement of the coalition heads. Of course, the latest opinion polls show that Pasok and Democratic Left would be big losers if an election was held soon. Both are currently polling around the 4-7% mark, compared to New Democracy at 29-30%. Rahman adds: Samaras personally comes in around 43% compared to Syriza's Tsipras at 37%, depending upon the poll). And government collapse would almost certainly lead to an internal leadership challenge within PASOK. Following the Cyprus president's appeal for its bailout to be reexamined, economist Shaun Richards argues that the country must consider leaving the single currency. He summarises Anastasiades' letter in this blog post, before wearily concluding: So far his appeal has fallen on deaf ears, as this morning a spokesman for the European Commission has made it clear \u2013 that just like the Titanic \u2013 the plan is to go full steam ahead. He then takes the latest economic data for Cyprus to assemble a dire picture of deflation, falling retail sales and shrinking GDP, with capital controls continuing to stifle economic growth. A repeat of Greece's depression-grade slump looks likely: Unfortunately the evidence so far is that my prediction from March 25th that the contraction that hit Greece will be repeated in Cyprus looks as though it is coming true and I fear that the risks are of something worse. However there is another way for Cyprus which would be to in effect reset the economic button via abandoning the capital controls imposed on her and leaving the Euro. At least there would be some hope and she would be doing so in a disinflationary phase which will help with any inflationary implications. However, Cyprus does have one weapon - the \u20ac11bn of assistance provided the the ECB to prop up its banking sector: As to threats from the Euro area she does have the bargaining counter of 11 billion Euros of Emergency Liquidity Assistance provided by the European Central Bank (via the Central Bank of Cyprus). So her bargaining position is stronger than it may initially appear. More here: Cyprus needs to leave the Euro to have any chance of an economic recovery Cyprus is now an evens-money bet to leave the eurozone within the next 12 months. Ladbrokes slashed its odds after president Anastiades called for its bailout to be revamped. The news that he had been swiftly rebuffed by EU officials this morning (see 9.25am), means Cyprus remains the most likely country to leave the eurozone. Next country to leave the Euro Cyprus: 1/2 Greece: 2/1 Slovenia: 7/1 Italy: 10/1 Spain: 10/1 Portugal: 12/1 Cyprus to leave the Euro within a year: evens Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes commented: Cyprus have always been market leaders when it comes to leaving the Euro next. The latest news has seen their position strengthen and it would now be considered an upset were they not to leave within a year at least. Time for another look ahead to Ben Bernanke's press conference tonight, and the Federal Reserve's monthly decision on monetary policy (see our opening post at 8.12am for details) Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale believes the Fed must start to slow its bond-buying programme soon, and is braced for some wild swings in the financial markets this summer. There are good and bad ways to let air out of balloons, but the worst of all is not to start. Most US economists expect the Fed to start reducing its monthly bond purchases later this year, but the wider market view is much more mixed and there are plenty who expect the FOMC to put enough criteria in the way of tapering, to calm markets. The next leg of a summer of market volatility is likely to start in the days ahead. Jane Foley of Rabobank points out that Bernanke brought the attention on himself. The weak US labour market means the Fed's unlikely to 'taper' its bond-buying programme tonight, she adds: Since Bernanke uttered the words on May 22 that the Fed could start to taper QE \u201cat the next few meetings\u201d, the markets have been focussed on the outcome of today\u2019s FOMC decision at 19:00 BST and the press conference that will follow 30 minutes later. Insofar as Bernanke is unlikely to contradict himself, it is likely that the Fed President will reiterate his warnings that the Fed could start to taper QE in the foreseeable future. However, we do not expect this to happen before the turn of the year. The US unemployment rate currently stands at 7.6%. This is significantly below the 10% high registered in 2009. However, the US labour market has a long way to go before it can claim to have returned to pre-crisis levels. The labour force participation rate has only just come off a 37 year low. This suggests that the headline unemployment rate is understating the actual levels of joblessness and underemployment in the economy, potentially by a large margin. And Ransquawk predicts that the Fed will reiterate that it expects to maintain exceptionally low rates until mid-2015 or until the unemployment rate reaches 6.5%. More in their video preview above, which explains how traders will be looking for any signs that Bernanke has turned more hawkish. The FT's James Mackintosh, though, reckons our bankers could even turn the threat of jail to their advantage: We're running a reader poll on whether the threat of jail for bad bankers would improve the industry, as recommended by the Banking Commission. Would the threat of jail be enough to end bankers' reckless behaviour? Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna believes it would help: The long-awaited report into Britain's banking sector, released at midnight, has captivated attention today. The recommendation that bankers guilty of 'reckless misconduct' could be jailed has captured attention, while the commission also criticised the macho culture in British banking, and the government's meddling in the sector in recent years. The report has been welcomed by chancellor George Osborne, Labour's Ed Balls, and many senior figures. We've rounded up all the reaction here. And here's our full story on the Banking Commission report: Banking commission: Bankers should be jailed for 'reckless misconduct' Commission led by Andrew Tyrie recommends jailing reckless bankers for and enforcing a wait for bonuses There are encouraging signs of life in Europe's construction sector, with production rising by 2.0% in the euro area in April compared with May. Eurostat reported big month-on-month increases in Germany (+6.7%), Portugal (+5.9%) and Italy (+5.5%). Work at civil engineering sites jumped by nearly 4% in the euro area, outpacing the 1.1% rise in building construction. Output across the EU rose by 0.9%. Monthly construction output can be volatile, and today's increase still leaves eurozone output around 6.6% lower than a year ago - in the early days of the recession. Still, it may suggest the downturn is bottoming out. Reuters has rounded up the early economist reaction to the Bank of England minutes, which showed its monetary policy committee was split 6-3 again over quantitative easng (and 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged). Here's some highlights: Ross Walker of Royal Bank of Scotland: There's no dramatic departure but the minutes serve as a reminder the MPC retains a dovish bias. The on-hold majority noted the rise in bond yields in response to Fed tapering concerns and hinted more QE could be done in response to that. Philip Rush of Nomura: It's as expected in terms of the vote split but, for me, the tone is slightly more dovish than the market might have expected. The minority voting for more QE thought the case for more stimulus remained compelling and the economic outlook was no stronger than it was in May. It seems clear that both Fisher and Miles will continue to vote for more QE when Carney takes over next month. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight: We now move to the Carney era at the Bank of England, and he will no doubt be relieved to see the economy looking a bit perkier as he takes up the reins. Indeed, with the economy currently showing signs of widespread improvement, pressure on Carney to take immediate action has receded thereby giving him more time to take full stock of the situation from within the Bank of England and to establish his working relationship with the rest of the MPC. \"We believe it is unlikely that any major policy action will occur at the July MPC meeting, especially as the committee will be getting the Bank of England\u2019s new growth and inflation forecasts at the August meeting. While we do not expect any action from the Bank of England in July, we believe further Quantitative Easing is still very possible further out. And here's more reaction: The situation in the eurozone helped to persuade King, Fisher and Miles that Britain's economy needs another \u00a325bn of quantitative easing (effectively creating fresh money to buy government bonds from the banks) The minutes state that: For other members the case for more monetary stimulus remained compelling..... The risks from the euro area remained substantial, especially through their potential effects on the UK banking sector. Commodity prices were lower and domestic cost pressures, as illustrated by very low pay growth, remained weak. The minutes also show that UK inflation, which hit 2.7% yesterday, is probably doing to hit 3% this summer. That's the level that precipitates a letter from the governor to the chancellor, explaining himself. That job will fall to King's replacement, Mark Carney: Sir Mervyn King was, again, outvoted in his bid for another dose of quantitative easing to stimulate the UK economy, for the final time before he leaves the Bank of England. Minutes from this month's Monetary Policy Committee meeting, just released, show that the committee divided 6-3 against another \u00a325bn of quantitative easing. Once again, the outgoing governor was joined by Paul Fisher and David Miles. The minutes are online here (pdf). Details and reaction to follow Eurozone officials have slapped down Cyprus's bid to have its bailout terms softened. Last week, Cyprus's president wrote to fellow eurozone leaders pleading for more help, and pointing out that his island was a casualty of the Greek debt restructuring. Anastasiades's appeal, though, is likely to be rebuffed when finance minister meet tomorrow, ahead of an euro summit next week. Reuters has the story: Asked if the terms of the bailout could be changed, one senior EU policymaker said: \"No, not as far as I can see.\" A second official said: \"There's no chance we'll revise the terms of the bailout, but we'll discuss it on Thursday.\"A third confirmed no change was possible in the short-term, but said there could \"potentially\" be adjustments in the medium term, as was the case of Greece. However, that also depends on euro zone leaders, who will meet on June 27-28. The officials were speaking after the Financial Times gave the letter the front-page treatment today: Open Europe has helpfully translated and published Anastasiades's letter here: Full letter from the Cypriot President to the Troika slamming Cypriot bailout In it, he warns that Cyprus's economy is struggling to cope with the shock of the abrubt restructing of its banking sector, a badly prepared bailout, and ongoing liquidity problems at the Bank of Cyprus - which he dubbed a 'mega-systemic bank'. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras and his coalition partners, PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos and Fotis Kouvelis of Democratic Left (DIMAR), are expected to discuss a cabinet reshuffle when they meet at 4pm BST tonight (or 6pm local time). Kathimerini describes the meeting as \"crucial talks aimed at bridging a rift over the closure of state broadcaster ERT that has put the future of the government in doubt\". Interestingly, officials from the Troika have paused their latest assessment of Greece's economy for a week, following talks last night. The finance ministry stated last night that the sides have made decent progress. However, following the ERT row, and the recent problems with its privatisation programme, the Troika must be concerned about the situation.... European stock markets are falling in early trading. The prospect of Ben Bernanke hinting tonight that the US stimulus package could be slowed soon is making investors cautious. \u2022 FTSE 100: down 36 points at 6337, - 0.6% \u2022 German DAX: down 48 points at 8180, -0.6% \u2022 French CAC: down 26 points at 3834, -0.7% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 65 points at 8114, -0.8% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 57 points at 16140, -0.35% Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at stockbroker Interactive Investor, says traders are nervous.... Despite strong signs of improvement in the US economy, equity markets have been pricing in investor sentiment that Bernanke won't be scaling back on his QE programme any time soon. Confirmation from the man himself later today may have the power to propel markets back up to recent highs but in early trade nervous investors are heading for the sidelines. Furthermore, market chatter that Bernanke may have decided not to stand for another term has awoken some bears from hibernation. On that last point, Barack Obama strongly hinted this week that Bernanke will exit the Fed when his term expires in early 2014. The US president said that, like the head of the FBI, Bernanke has \"already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to.\" Ben Bernanke's challenge tonight is to persuade those in the financial markets that the Fed can extricate itself from the warm, soothing glow of quantitative easing without a nasty shock. So argues Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities: So what is it that Mr Bernanke needs to deliver today in order for some form of calm to be restored? The simple answer is to persuade markets that the Fed and other central banks can exit QE [quantitative easing, or bond buying] without inflicting a cataclysmic blood bath in financial markets, and without forcing a more substantive deleveraging, and wholesale write-off of non-performing assets in the mainstream financial sector, and also not unleashing wholesale destruction in the shadow banking sector. In the \"Goldilocks\" scenario, Bernanke would argue that economic growth is just decent enough to allow some responsible slowing of QE at the appropriate time. Has he got the stomach for it, though, in the face of massive easing in Japan, and a rather stricter approach in the eurozone. Ostwald isn't sure: [it] looks to be an extraordinarily tall order for a man, who along with his departing 'academic in arms' Sir Mervyn King, is clearly weary of 'fighting a good theoretical fight' which founders eternally on the myopia of unreconstructed, and totally self-interested politicians and the captains of the financial sectors, along with those pesky realists that inhabit the ECB's increasingly numerous hawkish wing, (perhaps fleeing from Signor Activist Draghi). And here's more early reaction: Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets hopes that Bernanke can take the idea of 'tapering' (ie, slowing the pace of the Fed's bond-buying) off the agenda for a while: Maybe the markets are slowly coming round to accepting tapering will occur at some point (likely a few months away), but convinced now that there are no rate rises anytime soon and tapering can always be reversed? To be honest, a tapering of taper talk would be nice. Stan Shamu of IG reckons Bernanke will be cautious: There is a high probability that Mr Bernanke will only make minor changes to his statement and will re-emphasise inflation and employment as the key metrics for adjusting asset purchases. Following the recent data, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see minor revisions to growth and employment. And here's some Twitter chat, with Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit speculating that emerging market bonds could be hit if Bernanke hints at an early tightening: Coming up: \u2022 Bank of England minutes: 9.30am BST \u2022 Eurozone construction data for April: 10am BST / 11am CEST \u2022 Greek coalition leaders meet: from 4pm BST/ 6pm local time \u2022 Federal Reserve announces monetary policy decision, and releases latest economic forecasts: 7pm BST / 2pm EDT \u2022 Ben Bernanke's press conference: 7.30pm BST / 2.30pm EDT \u2022 George Osborne's Mansion House speech: 8pm BST Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest action across the eurozone, the financial markets and the global economy. Few central bank events in recent years have been anticipated quite as eagerly as today's meeting of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. The prospect of the Fed slowing its stimulus package has loomed over the financial markets for weeks now \u2013 and finally, it's time for Ben Bernanke to update us all on his views on America's economy, and future monetary policy. The Fed will also release new growth forecasts for the world's largest economy. The FOMC isn't expected to start tightening policy today, but Bernanke's performance at his press conference tonight will be vigorously combed over for signals as to when its bond purchase scheme might start to be 'tapered' (as the jargon has it). The Fed is currently buying $85bn of US government bonds and mortgage bonds each month with new electronic money, and the prospect of this punch bowl being taken away has already jolted shares and bonds in recent weeks. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets points out: Given recent market volatility it is going to extraordinarily difficult for the Fed Chairman to signal any type of exit strategy without causing some form of market rout, which essentially makes the Fed a hostage to market sentiment. adding: How he goes about managing perceptions in his press conference will determine whether or not we head straight back down again after last nights gains, with the likelihood that we could well see continued volatility throughout the summer as the market scrutinises each and every economic data point, with a view to timing the taper. Which also underlines what unusual times we are living through. There's also lots more going on today, both in the eurozone and beyond. \u2022 Greece's coalition leaders are holding fresh talks this afternoon to attempt to patch up relations, following the row over the closure of state broadcaster ERT. I'll also be monitoring reaction to the news that Cyprus's president has asked for its bailout to be rewritten. \u2022 In the UK, we get the latest minutes from the Bank of England's latest interest rate/QE-setting meeting. And, tonight, chancellor George Osborne will deliver the Mansion House Speech. Also, an influentual report into the banking sector, published by MPs this morning, will also dominate the news agenda in Britain. Its recommendations include the proposal that reckless bankers who cause a crisis should face jail. Busy day ahead....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has signalled he is ready to start the sell-off of the taxpayer's stake in Lloyds Banking Group, but said he is to consider whether to break up the Royal Bank of Scotland, in a move that could delay the bailed-out bank's return to the private sector. In his annual speech to City grandees at Mansion House on Wednesday night, the chancellor said he was \"actively considering options for share sales in Lloyds\", in which the government has a 39% stake. Speculation is mounting that a partial sell-off of the state's Lloyds stake could take place within months. But he played down expectations of an immediate \"Tell Sid\"-style privatisation, as implemented by the Conservatives for British Gas during the 1980s. Big City institutions are likely to be offered a chunk of shares first as an \"institutional placement is likely to be the most effective way of managing risk and getting value\". He added: \"And for later share sales, we will consider a retail offering to the general public.\" The chancellor also used his strongest language yet to signal his confidence that the economy is recovering nearly five years after the banking crisis forced taxpayers to pump \u00a365bn into the two banks. He said: \"We are moving from rescue to recovery. But while Britain has left intensive care, we still need to secure the recovery \u2013 and make sure we continue to treat the ailments that brought us low in the first place.\" Osborne told leading bankers and City figures assembled at Mansion House that the move to a share sell-off was a sign of this recovery, but he refused to set out a timetable. He stressed that bailed-out banks needed to support the economy through more lending to businesses and that a sell-off must generate an acceptable return for the taxpayer. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said Osborne had been forced to \"back down from the foolhardy idea of a pre-election firesale of RBS\". \"This would have meant a loss of billions of pounds to the taxpayer at the current share price,\" he said, urging the government to look at other options for RBS, including splitting its retail and investment banking arms. Balls said the chancellor's comments about the economy would make \"families and businesses think the chancellor is not living in the real world\". Osborne was speaking hours after the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, called on the government to consider an RBS break-up and introduce new rules to jail bankers for \"reckless misconduct\". Both those ideas were embraced by the government on Wednesday. David Cameron told MPs the financial services banking reform bill would be amended to introduce a new criminal offence for reckless misconduct, while Osborne used the cover of the commission's report to change his view on an RBS break-up. Only four months ago he had appeared to reject a break-up, but he said last night that \"with hindsight I think splitting RBS into a good bank and bad bank was probably what should have happened in 2008\". Osborne added: \"That is with hindsight. I wasn't in office. I didn't suggest it in opposition. And I'm not criticising my predecessor [Alistair Darling], who had to act quickly in a desperate situation.\" On the 81% stake in RBS, bought for \u00a345bn in 2008 and 2009 to stop the Edinburgh-based bank collapsing, Osborne said the sale was \"some way off\", despite the resignation of the bank's boss Stephen Hester last week in a move intended to speed up a sell-off. Any privatisation will be delayed by the review to look at whether a \"bad bank\" should be set up to house the Ulster Bank subsidiary and UK commercial property loans granted by RBS before its bailout. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said any steps that could speed up privatisation were worth \"thorough consideration\" but added: \"Ultimately any change to our strategy would need to be in the interests of all shareholders.\" Osborne took steps last night that the City regards as essential to kick off an RBS share sale by announcing talks to remove a special share \u2013 known as a dividend access share \u2013 put into RBS at the time of its bailout that prevents the bank paying dividends. It is estimated that the bank will have to pay the government as much as \u00a32bn to buy the share. External advisers will be appointed to conduct the three-month review of RBS. The chancellor stressed that no more taxpayer money would be pumped into the bank. The review might also be seen as a victory for Sir Mervyn King, who has been calling for a break-up of RBS. In his last speech as governor of the Bank of England, King told the Mansion House audience: \"I welcome your announcement that Lloyds Banking Group will be returned to private hands soon. And I very much support your plans for a full review of the structure of RBS.\" Banks, he said, needed to make a real contribution to the economy: \"It must be time for decisive action.\" King, who will be replaced by Canadian Mark Carney at the end of the month, said there were \"clear signs of recovery in the UK, albeit modest, under way\". But he appeared far less confident about the strength of the economy, saying \"the need to support the recovery remains\". It was also announced on Wednesdaynight that King would receive a life peerage, under rules that allow the prime minister to nominate up to 10 people for life peerages during each parliament. Cameron nominated King for his significant contribution to public service, Downing Street said. Osborne's upbeat language on the economy was a careful attempt to avoid the ridicule that one of his predecessors, Lord Lamont, faced in 1991 after claiming \"green shoots of economic spring\" were appearing in the middle of a recession. Other aspects of the banking commission report were accepted on Wednesday. A study of competition in the small business sector was launched while Cameron also voiced support for the commission's recommendation to force bankers to wait up to 10 years for bonuses. At prime minister's questions Ed Miliband seized on figures from the Office for National Statistics, which showed a 64% increase in bonuses over the past year, to attack the prime minister for giving bankers a tax cut. The cut in the top rate of income tax from 50p to 45p was introduced in April. Cameron said bonuses were a fifth of the size they were when under Labour was in power. Miliband retorted: \"He cannot deny the figures I read out to him. He doesn't even know the facts. Bonuses are up so that people can take advantage of his massive tax cut.\"",

    "webTitle": "Federal Reserve hints it could end stimulus program next year", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US Federal Reserve has signalled that it will end its massive stimulus programme next year amid further signs of a split in the central bank's committee. Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, said that if forecasts for the country's economic recovery are correct the bank could end its asset purchase scheme next summer, with the winding-down process due to start this year. Bernanke said the asset purchases would continue at their current rate until unemployment fell to about 7%, the first time that the Fed has specified an economic objective for the bond-buying. The unemployment rate stood at 7.6% in May. In an effort to assuage investors' concerns over the consequences for the world's largest economy, Bernanke likened the move to \"letting up the bit on the gas pedal as the car picks up speed, [and] not pressing on the brake.\" Bernanke's recent suggestion that the Fed could taper off its huge bond-buying programme, known as quantitative easing (QE), shook investors, and US stock markets fell sharply again as Bernanke gave further details about the possible winding down of the scheme at a press conference on Wednesday. The fall came even as the Fed concluded that the possibility that the America's economic recovery would slip into reverse, taking the jobs market with it, had \"diminished since the fall.\" In a statement released after a two-day meeting, the Fed said: \"Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.\" Against this backdrop, the Fed said it would continue to pump $85bn per month into the economy for now, buying $40bn of mortgage-backed securities and $45bn in Treasury bonds in an attempt to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels and to encourage investment. The Fed chairman was at pains to stress that there was no imminent intention to change QE or raise rates. \"It's important not to say: this date, that date, this time,\" Bernanke said. Any decision would be \"economic dependent\". However, two members of the FOMC signaled in the latest statement that they had doubts about the Fed's handling of QE. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, said the committee should \"signal more strongly its willingness to defend its inflation goal in light of recent low inflation readings\". Long-time QE critic Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, again voiced her concern that the policy \"increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances.\" Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private bank, said the mixed messages were likely to continue as the Fed wants to keep up its stimulus program while warning that it will not last forever. \"We believe Bernanke would like to keep the pedal to the floor with stimulus in an effort to spur as much growth and employment for as long as possible. \"At the same time, the Fed will continue to employ a Federal 'open mouth' policy to keep stocks and housing from rising too much further above fair value,\" he said in a note to investors. At his regular press conference this afternoon, the Fed chairman refused to be drawn on his future plans following comments by the president earlier this week. On Monday, Barack Obama said Bernanke has stayed in his job \"longer than he wanted to or he was supposed to.\" In an interview with Charlie Rose on PBS the president said Bernanke, a 59-year-old former Princeton University professor, had been \"an outstanding partner\" in helping the US recover \"from what could have been an economic crisis of epic proportions.\" \"I am not going to comment on my personal plans,\" said Bernanke. Bernanke was appointed chairman by president George W Bush in February 2006. His second four-year stint at the central bank officially ends January 31. While few expected him to seek, or get, a third term the comments were seen as a clearest signal yet that his time as Fed chairman is drawing to a close.",

      "body": "<p>The US Federal Reserve has signalled that it will end its massive stimulus programme next year amid further signs of a split in the central bank's committee.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, said that if forecasts for the country's economic recovery are correct the bank could end its asset purchase scheme next summer, with the winding-down process due to start this year.</p> <p>Bernanke said the asset purchases would continue at their current rate until unemployment fell to about 7%, the first time that the Fed has specified an economic objective for the bond-buying. The unemployment rate stood at 7.6% in May.</p> <p>In an effort to assuage investors' concerns over the consequences for the world's largest economy, Bernanke likened the move to \"letting up the bit on the gas pedal as the car picks up speed, [and] not pressing on the brake.\"</p> <p>Bernanke's recent suggestion that the Fed could taper off its huge bond-buying programme, known as quantitative easing (QE), shook investors, and US stock markets fell sharply again as Bernanke gave further details about the possible winding down of the scheme at a press conference on Wednesday.</p> <p>The fall came even as the Fed concluded that the possibility that the America's economic recovery would slip into reverse, taking the jobs market with it, had \"diminished since the fall.\"</p> <p>In a statement released after a two-day meeting, the Fed said: \"Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.\"</p> <p>Against this backdrop, the Fed said it would continue to pump $85bn per month into the economy for now, buying $40bn of mortgage-backed securities and $45bn in Treasury bonds in an attempt to keep interest<br>rates at rock-bottom levels and to encourage investment.</p> <p>The Fed chairman was at pains to stress that there was no imminent intention to change QE or raise rates. \"It's important not to say: this date, that date, this time,\" Bernanke said. Any decision would be \"economic dependent\".</p> <p>However, two members of the FOMC signaled in the latest statement that they had doubts about the Fed's handling of QE. James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, said the committee should \"signal more strongly its willingness to defend its inflation goal in light of recent low inflation readings\".</p> <p>Long-time QE critic Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, again voiced her concern that the policy \"increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances.\"</p> <p>Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private bank, said the mixed messages were likely to continue as the Fed wants to keep up its stimulus program while warning that it will not last forever. \"We believe Bernanke would like to keep the pedal to the floor with stimulus in an effort to spur as much growth and employment for as long as possible.</p> <p>\"At the same time, the Fed will continue to employ a Federal 'open mouth' policy to keep stocks and housing from rising too much further above fair value,\" he said in a note to investors.</p> <p>At his regular press conference this afternoon, the Fed chairman refused to be drawn on his future plans following comments by the president earlier this week.</p> <p>On Monday, Barack Obama said Bernanke has stayed in his job \"longer than he wanted to or he was supposed to.\" In an interview with Charlie Rose on PBS the president said Bernanke, a 59-year-old former Princeton University professor, had been \"an outstanding partner\" in helping the US recover \"from what could have been an economic crisis of epic proportions.\" </p> <p>\"I am not going to comment on my personal plans,\" said Bernanke. Bernanke was appointed chairman by president George W Bush in February 2006. His second four-year stint at the central bank officially ends January 31. While few expected him to seek, or get, a third term the comments were seen as a clearest signal yet that his time as Fed chairman is drawing to a close.</p>",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Royal Mail staff vote against privatisation", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail workers have voted overwhelming against the government's controversial plan to sell off the 497-year-old postal service. More than 96% of postal workers who voted opposed the privatisation despite the government promising them each about \u00a31,500 in shares as part of the flotation plan. Billy Hayes, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which organised the ballot of 112,000 Royal Mail staff, said: \"No one has yet asked postal workers what they think about privatisation. Today postal workers have spoken loud and clear. \"The workforce does not support the government or Royal Mail on selling the company. This company is flourishing in public ownership as the recent doubling of profits proves.\" Business minister Michael Fallon has promised that workers will collect at least 10% of the shares in the privatisation, which could generate up to \u00a33bn for the government. Dave Ward, the deputy general secretary of the CWU, said postal workers would not \"sacrifice their souls for a so-called 10% stake when they know their jobs, pensions and conditions are once again under threat\". Royal Mail workers also voted nine-to-one in favour of a boycott of delivering competitors' mail. But the company took the CWU to the high court on Wednesday to seek an injunction to prevent the boycott. A judge will make a ruling next Friday. The company warned employees that a boycott could result in a significant loss of business. Royal Mail accepts letters and parcels at its mail centres that have been partially sorted by large customers and other postal operators, and delivers them to 29m homes and businesses for an agreed price. \"Royal Mail is required by law to allow access to our network and deliver all the mail we are asked to,\" a spokesman said. The consultative ballot, which had a turnout of 74%, is likely to lead to a vote on strike action, which could severely damage the government's chances of securing a successful sale. Some potential City shareholders have already let it be known that they will not invest in Royal Mail because of the threat of industrial action. Fallon said he was disappointed with the CWU's vote. \"I'm focused on what's best for Royal Mail's employees, customers and the taxpayer,\" he said. \"I want to implement a share scheme that will give employees a real stake in the company as they were promised two years ago. I urge the union to continue to engage on our plans for Royal Mail. \"Our plans are not new. Parliament debated and backed our intention to sell shares in Royal Mail more than two years ago. Everyone agrees that Royal Mail needs to change if we are to protect the future of the six-day-a-week one price goes anywhere service. To do so, Royal Mail needs future access to private sector capital to meet the challenges of a changing postal market and to take advantage of opportunities such as the boom in on-line shopping.\" Royal Mail said privatisation would enable the company to \"combine the best of the public and private sectors and secure as many good quality jobs as possible\". \"The UK government has made it clear it does not have the capital itself to invest in Royal Mail. It wants that capital to come from the private sector,\" a spokesman said. The company said privatisation would not affect employees' terms and conditions.",

Today postal workers have spoken loud and clear.</p> <p>\"The workforce does not support the government or Royal Mail on selling the company. This company is flourishing in public ownership as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/21/royal-mail-profits-324m-pounds\" title=\"\">recent doubling of profits proves</a>.\"</p> <p>Business minister Michael Fallon has promised that workers will collect at least 10% of the shares in the privatisation, which could generate up to \u00a33bn for the government.</p> <p>Dave Ward, the deputy general secretary of the CWU, said postal workers would not \"sacrifice their souls for a so-called 10% stake when they know their jobs, pensions and conditions are once again under threat\".</p> <p>Royal Mail workers also voted nine-to-one in favour of a boycott of delivering competitors' mail. But the company took the CWU to the high court on Wednesday to seek an injunction to prevent the boycott. A judge will make a ruling next Friday.</p> <p>The company warned employees that a boycott could result in a significant loss of business.</p> <p>Royal Mail accepts letters and parcels at its mail centres that have been partially sorted by large customers and other postal operators, and delivers them to 29m homes and businesses for an agreed price. \"Royal Mail is required by law to allow access to our network and deliver all the mail we are asked to,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>The consultative ballot, which had a turnout of 74%, is likely to lead to a vote on strike action, which could severely damage the government's chances of securing a successful sale. Some potential City shareholders have already let it be known that they will not invest in Royal Mail because of the threat of industrial action.</p> <p>Fallon said he was disappointed with the CWU's vote. \"I'm focused on what's best for Royal Mail's employees, customers and the taxpayer,\" he said. \"I want to implement a share scheme that will give employees a real stake in the company as they were promised two years ago. I urge the union to continue to engage on our plans for Royal Mail.</p> <p>\"Our plans are not new. Parliament debated and backed our intention to sell shares in Royal Mail more than two years ago. Everyone agrees that Royal Mail needs to change if we are to protect the future of the six-day-a-week one price goes anywhere service. To do so, Royal Mail needs future access to private sector capital to meet the challenges of a changing postal market and to take advantage of opportunities such as the boom in on-line shopping.\"</p> <p>Royal Mail said privatisation would enable the company to \"combine the best of the public and private sectors and secure as many good quality jobs as possible\".</p> <p>\"The UK government has made it clear it does not have the capital itself to invest in Royal Mail. It wants that capital to come from the private sector,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>The company said privatisation would not affect employees' terms and conditions.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "After lobbying Congress to weaken the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, big banks are delivering the coup de grace by litigation", 
      "body": "<p>Last week, in a Washington, DC courtroom, a whole bunch of powerful people gathered with a common purpose: to try to kill the Dodd-Frank financial reform act. </p> <p>That quest may seem a bit overdone, given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/16/wall-street-rolling-back-regulation\">already weakened state of the attempt at financial regulation</a> \u2013 like taking a hammer to a housefly. </p> <p>Still, a phalanx of injured parties \u2013 11 states, two groups dedicated to conservative economic agendas and one Texas state bank \u2013 argued that Dodd-Frank is unconstitutional. </p> <p>Their complaints all center around the part of Dodd-Frank that wants to solve the problem of \"too big to fail\" by allowing regulators to manage the bankruptcy of big banks. The idea of this affront to capitalism makes the people behind the lawsuit sputter \u2013 in a way that, strangely, they never do at the prospect of the government having to step in and save banks with multibillion-dollar bailouts. Among their complaints is that: the law forces banks to bow to the authority of the US Treasury; it interferes with state securities regulators; and it imposes high costs of complying with the law on small banks, as well as the larger ones that can afford it. </p> <p>The lawsuit also argued that banks should, in effect, be allowed to remain too big to fail because it is unconstitutional to give the US Treasury the power to wind them down: <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/morning_call/2013/02/texas-joins-dodd-frank-lawsuit.html\">it argues that Dodd-Frank</a> \"empowers the Treasury Secretary to order the liquidation of a financial company with little or no advance warning, under cover of mandatory secrecy, and without either useful statutory guidance or meaningful legislative, executive or judicial oversight.\"</p> <p>The depth of the outrage from Wall Street and its legislative nursemaids is amusing sometimes, in that it is entirely out of scale with the weakness and uselessness of the law they're attacking. </p> <p>In joining the lawsuit, the <a href=\"http://law.ga.gov/press-releases/2013-02-13/attorney-general-olens-joins-lawsuit-challenging-dodd-frank\">state of Georgia exaggeratedly denounced the law</a> \u2013 as mortifying a stab at regulation as ever existed \u2013 as \"the federal takeover of the financial industry\". Or consider this:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The law's Title II gives the Treasury secretary and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp unprecedented authority to 'liquidate' financial companies. This grants immense power to a handful of unelected federal bureaucrats, empowering them to pick winners and losers among a <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444180004578016953529778498.html\">liquidated company's investors</a>.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's not really clear why elections matter here, when deciding how to save the financial system from destruction. It's entirely perplexing why \"unelected federal bureaucrats\" at the Treasury and FDIC \u2013 who, by the way, helped save the financial industry from itself in 2009 \u2013 are any worse than unelected traders or unelected bank executives. Maybe, it's related to the fact that federal bureaucrats who aren't elected also don't need to take campaign donations to get elected, and thus are beyond the reach of the financial industry's greenback seductions.</p> <p>It was the government's job to defend Dodd-Frank against this initial assault. According to the <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/dodd-frank-in-court/\">Washington Free Beacon</a>, the government's response was to argue that the lawsuit shouldn't exist because it is \"speculative\" to claim that Dodd-Frank caused anyone any harm. </p> <p>In other words, the same government that authored the sweeping regulations four years ago was forced to argue \u2013 all too correctly \u2013 \"what financial reform?\"</p> <p>In the end, the only surprising thing about the lawsuit against Dodd-Frank was that anyone had even bothered. Who are they fighting against? Almost everyone who supported aggressive financial reform has either been shouted down or left the field. Both Chris Dodd and Barney Frank have moved on to other things. Occupy Wall Street focused a magnifying glass on better financial regulation for what, in retrospect, was only a brief moment of emotional clarity and action. Paul Volcker \u2013 the brilliant author of the eponymous and likely doomed rule that will keep banks from investing for their own accounts \u2013 started an institute that will, in part, seek to teach Congress how to legislate on finance. Good luck with that, <a href=\"http://ineteconomics.org/people/paul-volcker\">Mr Volcker</a>. </p> <p>Subsequently, legislation has gone the way it always has: in favor of those with the money to influence it to their advantage.</p> <p>Unlike the general populace, which has let any outrage go to seed, Wall Street has focused its anger. No one in finance is taking any chances. For years, Wall Street has been punching into financial reform using any tool at hand, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/11/jpmorgan-chase-2-billion-dodd-frank_n_1509550.html\">whether it's public rhetoric</a>, lobbying or the courts. </p> <p>Lobbying has already weakened any attempt at regulating derivatives. For no apparent reason, the administration is rumored to have plans to oust a powerful, smart regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees complex Wall Street products including derivatives like the ones that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/16/wall-street-rolling-back-regulation\">contributed to the near-destruction of many banks</a> in 2008. Not surprisingly, Wall Street has thrown several lawsuits at the CFTC in an attempt to weaken it. </p> <p>The courts are, indeed, an increasingly popular option for Wall Street, perhaps because a litigation strategy forces their high-priced battalions of lawyers to do something to earn their exorbitant fees. Besides the \"too big to fail\" lawsuit, there has been a throng of what are essentially nuisance lawsuits against regulation.

      "bodyText": "Last week, in a Washington, DC courtroom, a whole bunch of powerful people gathered with a common purpose: to try to kill the Dodd-Frank financial reform act. That quest may seem a bit overdone, given the already weakened state of the attempt at financial regulation \u2013 like taking a hammer to a housefly. Still, a phalanx of injured parties \u2013 11 states, two groups dedicated to conservative economic agendas and one Texas state bank \u2013 argued that Dodd-Frank is unconstitutional. Their complaints all center around the part of Dodd-Frank that wants to solve the problem of \"too big to fail\" by allowing regulators to manage the bankruptcy of big banks. The idea of this affront to capitalism makes the people behind the lawsuit sputter \u2013 in a way that, strangely, they never do at the prospect of the government having to step in and save banks with multibillion-dollar bailouts. Among their complaints is that: the law forces banks to bow to the authority of the US Treasury; it interferes with state securities regulators; and it imposes high costs of complying with the law on small banks, as well as the larger ones that can afford it. The lawsuit also argued that banks should, in effect, be allowed to remain too big to fail because it is unconstitutional to give the US Treasury the power to wind them down: it argues that Dodd-Frank \"empowers the Treasury Secretary to order the liquidation of a financial company with little or no advance warning, under cover of mandatory secrecy, and without either useful statutory guidance or meaningful legislative, executive or judicial oversight.\" The depth of the outrage from Wall Street and its legislative nursemaids is amusing sometimes, in that it is entirely out of scale with the weakness and uselessness of the law they're attacking. In joining the lawsuit, the state of Georgia exaggeratedly denounced the law \u2013 as mortifying a stab at regulation as ever existed \u2013 as \"the federal takeover of the financial industry\". Or consider this: \"The law's Title II gives the Treasury secretary and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp unprecedented authority to 'liquidate' financial companies. This grants immense power to a handful of unelected federal bureaucrats, empowering them to pick winners and losers among a liquidated company's investors.\" It's not really clear why elections matter here, when deciding how to save the financial system from destruction. It's entirely perplexing why \"unelected federal bureaucrats\" at the Treasury and FDIC \u2013 who, by the way, helped save the financial industry from itself in 2009 \u2013 are any worse than unelected traders or unelected bank executives. Maybe, it's related to the fact that federal bureaucrats who aren't elected also don't need to take campaign donations to get elected, and thus are beyond the reach of the financial industry's greenback seductions. It was the government's job to defend Dodd-Frank against this initial assault. According to the Washington Free Beacon, the government's response was to argue that the lawsuit shouldn't exist because it is \"speculative\" to claim that Dodd-Frank caused anyone any harm. In other words, the same government that authored the sweeping regulations four years ago was forced to argue \u2013 all too correctly \u2013 \"what financial reform?\" In the end, the only surprising thing about the lawsuit against Dodd-Frank was that anyone had even bothered. Who are they fighting against? Almost everyone who supported aggressive financial reform has either been shouted down or left the field. Both Chris Dodd and Barney Frank have moved on to other things. Occupy Wall Street focused a magnifying glass on better financial regulation for what, in retrospect, was only a brief moment of emotional clarity and action. Paul Volcker \u2013 the brilliant author of the eponymous and likely doomed rule that will keep banks from investing for their own accounts \u2013 started an institute that will, in part, seek to teach Congress how to legislate on finance. Good luck with that, Mr Volcker. Subsequently, legislation has gone the way it always has: in favor of those with the money to influence it to their advantage. Unlike the general populace, which has let any outrage go to seed, Wall Street has focused its anger. No one in finance is taking any chances. For years, Wall Street has been punching into financial reform using any tool at hand, whether it's public rhetoric, lobbying or the courts. Lobbying has already weakened any attempt at regulating derivatives. For no apparent reason, the administration is rumored to have plans to oust a powerful, smart regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees complex Wall Street products including derivatives like the ones that contributed to the near-destruction of many banks in 2008. Not surprisingly, Wall Street has thrown several lawsuits at the CFTC in an attempt to weaken it. The courts are, indeed, an increasingly popular option for Wall Street, perhaps because a litigation strategy forces their high-priced battalions of lawyers to do something to earn their exorbitant fees. Besides the \"too big to fail\" lawsuit, there has been a throng of what are essentially nuisance lawsuits against regulation. One \u2013 thankfully dismissed \u2013 opposed an anti-bribery rule. Another took umbrage at the fact that Dodd-Frank requires them to turn over too much trading information. One hard-fought suit concerned the ability of two powerful exchanges to charge more for their data about the markets. Yet another lawsuit prevented shareholders \u2013 owners of a company \u2013 from removing members of the board of directors. The path of these lawsuits is fairly predictable, for the most part. As the New York Times pointed out last year: \"The court has tossed out [Securities and Exchange Commission] rules six times in seven years.\" A Gallup poll recently found that 26% of people who answered its poll have \"a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in banks\". Their confidence is likely in the ability of banks to survive economic busts \u2013 but really, it should be in the industry's ability to avoid the consequences of its worst behavior.",

    "webTitle": "Banking commission: Bankers should be jailed for 'reckless misconduct'", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is facing pressure to radically overhaul Britain's banks by introducing a new law to jail bankers for \"reckless misconduct\" and force bankers to wait up to 10 years to receive their bonuses. The proposals, among the key measures recommended in a major report by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, also include a call on him to consider breaking up the Royal Bank of Scotland. They come ahead of the chancellor's crucial set-piece Mansion House speech to the City on Wednesday night. The chancellor is urged to restore confidence in the financial system by making top bankers more accountable for their actions in the wake of the 2008 bank bailouts, the Libor rigging scandal, and the shoddy treatment of customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. The senior Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, who led the commission, said the 80 or so recommendations were intended to \"change banking for good\". They also include giving regulators new powers to halt bonus payouts and pensions for bosses of any banks that have to be bailed out by the taxpayer in the future. \"It is not just bankers that need to change. The actions of regulators and governments have contributed to the decline in standards,\" Tyrie added. Set up in the wake of Barclays' \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor a year ago and counting former chancellor Lord Lawson and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby among its members, the commission also uses its 550-page report to call for: \u2022 A revamp of the way bankers are authorised to work in the City and to make top bankers more accountable after so few of them were sanctioned following the 2008 banking crisis. \u2022 An audit of the number of women on trading floors, on the grounds that employing more female traders could reduce risk. \u2022 New measures to foster high street competition, including an investigation into whether bank accounts numbers can be made portable in the same way as mobile phone numbers. \u2022 Giving everyone a right to a simple bank account. \u2022 And an overhaul of the \"court\" of the Bank of England, giving it a new board of directors. The Treasury is ready to make amendments to the finance bill to adopt the recommendations. It consulted last year on the possibility of criminal sanctions for directors of failed banks but has yet to publish its conclusions. In the past, the commission's report said, top bankers had \"donned blindfolds\" as they knew they could not be punished for wrongdoings they could not see. When they could \"not claim ignorance, they fell back on the claim that everyone was party to a decision ... the Orient Express defence\". The report, which will be supplemented today by seven more hefty volumes, reopens the debate about the future of 81% taxpayer-owned RBS by calling on Osborne to review, by September, whether it should be broken up into a good and bad bank. Tyrie warned the government it may need to be \"bold\" on the future of RBS and consider the merits of all options to break it up and sell it off, including splitting it into a number of smaller banks in order to boost competition on the high street. \"The current state of RBS creates problems for banking competition and for the British economy. Further restructuring may well be needed. The government may need to be bold,\" Tyrie said. \"Political considerations must be put to one side,\" and parliament needed to be told of any \"insuperable\" obstacles to a break up. Osborne is expected to use his Mansion House speech today to signal a sell off the government's 39% stake in Lloyds Banking Group but he is not thought likely to endorse the idea by the cross-party commission to shut down UK Financial Investments, the body set up to look up after the taxpayers' stakes in the bailed-out banks. The commission described UKFI as a \"fig leaf\" to hide political interference by the chancellor, who yesterday insisted he had not personally forced Stephen Hester to resign as boss of RBS last week to clear the way for the bank's privatisation. The commission, though, said the government had interfered in the running of both bailed-out banks. \"On occasions it has done so directly, on others it appears to have acted indirectly, using UKFI as its proxy,\" the report said. Osborne is also facing pressure from business secretary Vince Cable to back away from any quick sale of RBS while Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, is telling him to \"resist the temptation for a loss-making fire sale\". Balls said: \"The government must look at the whole range of options for the future of RBS to ensure the taxpayer gets its money back and there is no return to business as usual.\" The report does not recommend a full-blown competition investigation into the banking industry, which is dominated by the big four of RBS, Lloyds, Barclays and HSBC \u2013 an option that Cable is thought to regard as important. Pat McFadden, a Labour MP who sat on the commission, said: \"Our report is about tackling the cultural and standards failings in banks. From running unacceptable risks with other people's money to PPI mis-selling, money laundering and Libor interest rate rigging, these failings have been a betrayal of the taxpayers who bailed out the banks and the majority of good honest people who work in the industry.\" A Treasury spokesman described the report as \"very impressive\", saying: \"The government publicly welcomes the commission's recommendations on increased personal responsibility especially at a senior level, increased professional judgment by regulators and better functioning markets. We will report before the summer recess.\"",

      "body": "<p>George Osborne is facing pressure to radically overhaul Britain's banks by introducing a new law to jail bankers for \"reckless misconduct\" and force bankers to wait up to 10 years to receive their bonuses.</p> <p>The proposals, among the key measures recommended in a <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/professional-standards-in-the-banking-industry/news/changing-banking-for-good-report/\">major report by the parliamentary commission on banking standards</a>, also include a call on him to consider breaking up the Royal Bank of Scotland. They come ahead of the chancellor's crucial set-piece Mansion House speech to the City on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The chancellor is urged to restore confidence in the financial system by making top bankers more accountable for their actions in the wake of the 2008 bank bailouts, the Libor rigging scandal, and the shoddy treatment of customers mis-sold payment protection insurance.</p> <p>The senior Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, who led the commission, said the 80 or so recommendations were intended to \"change banking for good\". They also include giving regulators new powers to halt bonus payouts and pensions for bosses of any banks that have to be bailed out by the taxpayer in the future.</p> <p>\"It is not just bankers that need to change. The actions of regulators and governments have contributed to the decline in standards,\" Tyrie added.</p> <p>Set up in the wake of Barclays' \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor a year ago and counting former chancellor Lord Lawson and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby among its members, the commission also uses its 550-page report to call for:</p> <p>\u2022 A revamp of the way bankers are authorised to work in the City and to make top bankers more accountable after so few of them were sanctioned following the 2008 banking crisis.</p> <p>\u2022 An audit of the number of women on trading floors, on the grounds that employing more female traders could reduce risk.</p> <p>\u2022 New measures to foster high street competition, including an investigation into whether bank accounts numbers can be made portable in the same way as mobile phone numbers.</p> <p>\u2022 Giving everyone a right to a simple bank account.</p> <p>\u2022 And an overhaul of the \"court\" of the Bank of England, giving it a new board of directors.</p> <p>The Treasury is ready to make amendments to the finance bill to adopt the recommendations. It consulted last year on the possibility of criminal sanctions for directors of failed banks but has yet to publish its conclusions.</p> <p>In the past, the commission's report said, top bankers had \"donned blindfolds\" as they knew they could not be punished for wrongdoings they could not see. When they could \"not claim ignorance, they fell back on the claim that everyone was party to a decision ... the Orient Express defence\".</p> <p>The report, which will be supplemented today by seven more hefty volumes, reopens the debate about the future of 81% taxpayer-owned RBS by calling on Osborne to review, by September, whether it should be broken up into a good and bad bank. Tyrie warned the government it may need to be \"bold\" on the future of RBS and consider the merits of all options to break it up and sell it off, including splitting it into a number of smaller banks in order to boost competition on the high street.</p> <p>\"The current state of RBS creates problems for banking competition and for the British economy. Further restructuring may well be needed. The government may need to be bold,\" Tyrie said.</p> <p>\"Political considerations must be put to one side,\" and parliament needed to be told of any \"insuperable\" obstacles to a break up.</p> <p>Osborne is expected to use his Mansion House speech today to signal a sell off the government's 39% stake in Lloyds Banking Group but he is not thought likely to endorse the idea by the cross-party commission to shut down UK Financial Investments, the body set up to look up after the taxpayers' stakes in the bailed-out banks.</p> <p>The commission described UKFI as a \"fig leaf\" to hide political interference by the chancellor, who yesterday insisted he had not personally forced Stephen Hester to resign as boss of RBS last week to clear the way for the bank's privatisation.</p> <p>The commission, though, said the government had interfered in the running of both bailed-out banks. \"On occasions it has done so directly, on others it appears to have acted indirectly, using UKFI as its proxy,\" the report said.</p> <p>Osborne is also facing pressure from business secretary Vince Cable to back away from any quick sale of RBS while Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, is telling him to \"resist the temptation for a loss-making fire sale\".

Cameron claims this will \"identify where multinational companies are earning their profits and paying their taxes so we can track and expose those who aren't paying their fair share\".

However, the prime minister appears to have been left isolated on the issue by his G8 peers. The final leaders' communique offered little more than support for an existing review being carried out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), another international quango. The FATF believes a central register is just one way forward, with other proposals more akin to imposing tougher know-your-customer rules on company administrators. With little common ground on transparency thresholds the G8 declared that nations would each commit to their own \"action plans\" on this issue. The UK is to set up a central registry of beneficial owners, but will consult on whether this should be made publicly accessible.

Before the G8 meeting, Cameron was able to claim a victory by corralling many British affiliated tax havens \u2013 crown dependencies and overseas territories \u2013 into signing up to some less onerous tax co-operation initiatives. The gold standard in this area is a US measure called FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), an aggressive unilateral initiative that comes into force later this year requiring financial firms to disclose details of all US citizens' assets held overseas or face punishing taxes. There are signs that Europe and others could follow with similar draconian measures, setting a common international standard. \"We call on all jurisdictions to adopt and effectively implement this new single global standard at the earliest opportunity,\" the G8 communique said.</p> <p><strong>How will the summit be judged?</strong></p> <p>Cameron's verdict at the closing press conference was that he had secured a G8 declaration that \"has the potential to rewrite the rules on tax and transparency for the benefit of countries across the world\". New tools, he said, would now be forged that would help ensure \"proper tax justice in our world\". But most tax campaigners were last night expressing disappointment at a final communique long on talk and short on commitment.
