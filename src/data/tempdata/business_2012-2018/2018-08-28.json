      "bodyText": "Aston Martin is to float on the London Stock Exchange in a deal that could value James Bond\u2019s favourite sports car brand at about \u00a35bn. The luxury carmaker announced plans to sell about \u00a31bn worth of shares in the initial public offering (IPO), which chief executive Andy Palmer described as \u201ca key milestone\u201d in the company\u2019s history. Aston Martin, which was founded in a small London workshop in 1913 and has expanded to become one of the world\u2019s biggest sports car brands, has been debating whether to float its shares in London or New York. Aston Martin aims to publish a prospectus including full details of the share sale on 20 September. Eligible employees and customers of the carmaker will be able to apply to buy shares at the offer price. The flotation will be a big test of the appetite of investors to back British companies, as very few large IPOs are expected before the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union in March 2019. Palmer has said that Brexit is not a huge concern for the company as it sells relatively few cars into continental Europe and is also used to dealing with tariffs in most of its export markets. However, the company imports about two-thirds of its parts from Europe. The carmaker is hoping to double production to 14,000 vehicles a year as demand from super-rich car enthusiasts increases. The company, which is based in Gaydon in Warwickshire, sold 5,098 cars last year \u2013 its highest number in nine years. The fastest growing markets were the US, the UK and China. Palmer said there had been an explosion of growth in China, with sales up 89% year-on-year. Aston Martin plans to open 10 new showrooms in China. The company, which suffered a \u00a3163m loss in 2016, made a pretax profit of \u00a387m last year on record revenues of \u00a3876m. Aston Martins sold for an average of \u00a3160,000 in the first three months of this year \u2013 an 11% increase on the same period a year earlier. The company said the increase was due to more buyers choosing to personalise their vehicles with costly design options and special features. The character of James Bond has driven an Aston Martin intermittently on film since 1964, when he drove a DB5 in Goldfinger. For the following year\u2019s Thunderball, the car was adapted with a water cannon and a boot-stowed jetpack. The DB5 returned in Goldeneye in 1995 and in several Bond films since, including Skyfall and Spectre. The company last week announced plans to create 25 Goldfinger DB5s complete with some of Bond\u2019s gadgets, including revolving number plates. The cars, which will all come in Bond\u2019s silver birch colour, will cost \u00a32.75m each and will not be road legal. The company recently began production of its new Vantage sports car model, which is hand-built in Gaydon. Marking the start of production of the Vantage earlier this year, Greg Clark, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, said: \u201cAston Martin is an iconic brand that is an integral part of Britain\u2019s proud automotive heritage. \u201cThrough our modern industrial strategy we are building on this success, and the new Vantage is a British-built car exemplifying the skill and innovation that sets the UK auto sector apart from its competitors.\u201d Next to hit the production line will be the DBS Superleggera, a super-GT with a top speed of 211 mph (340km/h) and 0-62 mph acceleration in 3.4 seconds. The company is building a new factory in Wales, where it is expected to base production of its Lagonda Vision emissions-free electric sports car.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney played hard to get when he was first approached by George Osborne to take over from Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England. When Carney demanded a generous remuneration package, Osborne said yes. When Carney said he would only serve five years at Threadneedle Street rather than the eight specified in the job description, the then chancellor said yes to that as well. Carney has since relented a little on his departure date, pushing it back by a year from the summer of 2018 after being sweet-talked by Philip Hammond into staying on until after Britain\u2019s scheduled departure from the EU next March. Now a rumour has surfaced that Carney has been approached about extending his term until 2020. The Treasury did not exactly pour cold water all over the story, saying merely that it did not recognise the report. That\u2019s probably because Hammond would like to have Carney at the Bank for as long as possible. One small \u2013 but not insignificant \u2013 reason for that is that if Carney goes as planned next summer Hammond would have to spend scarce Treasury management time this autumn searching for a successor. An advert asking for applications was supposed to go out in July but has yet to appear. But Hammond\u2019s reluctance to see Carney depart next year goes deeper than that. The chancellor thinks the governor is an asset for Britain; he likes having Carney next to him at international meetings. The two men also have similar views about Brexit: namely, that there is a danger to the economy from a no-deal outcome. Hammond would find some high-level support useful in what could be bruising cabinet and internal Conservative party battles to come. Last but not least, Carney soothed the financial markets in the choppy days that followed the EU referendum in June 2016, but his impact might well be blunted next spring if he is a lame-duck governor. So, from Hammond\u2019s point of view, it is a no-brainer. The real question is whether Carney wants to do a seven-year stint at the Bank. In turn, that might depend on what his plans are after he leaves Threadneedle Street. Carney was once seen as a future Canadian prime minister or as a possible managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Neither job looks likely to become vacant by next summer and there are not that many Carney-shaped holes out there. Nafta winner? Not quite Trade is a complex business. Only the initiated really understand tariff schedules, quota arrangements, facilitation agreements and intellectual property rights. That\u2019s why there are really only two types of trade stories: \u201ctrade war looms\u201d or \u201ctrade war averted\u201d. This week, markets are up because they think the deal struck between the US and Mexico means the threat of protectionism has been rolled back. Donald Trump\u2019s tough negotiating style appears to have paid off. The North American free trade agreement (Nafta) will be re-written in a way that is more favourable to the US. Mexico has already sued for peace. Canada will shortly do the same. Game, set and match to the White House. Well, not quite. For a start, the detail really does matter when it comes to trade deals and the small print of the agreement between the US and Mexico remains sketchy. What\u2019s more, Trump only has authority to conclude a deal with all three original Nafta partners: Congress would need to approve separate US-Mexico and US-Canada trade agreements. That might prove difficult. Finally, Trump has opened three separate trade wars with Nafta, the European Union and China. If the president sees the renegotiation of Nafta as an unalloyed success \u2013 as he undoubtedly does \u2013 that will encourage him to take a hardline with Brussels and Beijing. Last week\u2019s talks between the US and China did not go well. Meanwhile, the latest set of US trade figures show that the deficit widened from $67.9bn to $72.2bn in July. That\u2019s only to be expected given that Trump\u2019s tax cuts are boosting consumer demand and sucking in imports. But it is likely to harden the president\u2019s stance. Wonga wobbles Wonga is in serious trouble. But although accountants from Grant Thornton are standing ready to put the payday loan company into administration, sadly this does not mean that UK households are finding it easier to make ends meet. On the contrary, Wonga\u2019s financial problems are due to a surge in compensation claims. If it goes under, other lenders will take its place.",

    "webTitle": "Sports Direct blames 'greedy landlords' for any House of Fraser job cuts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has raised the stakes in negotiations with House of Fraser store owners, warning it would be the fault of \u201cgreedy landlords\u201d if hundreds of retail jobs are lost as a result of looming closures. The sportswear retailer, controlled by Mike Ashley, snapped up the stricken department store chain for \u00a390m earlier this month but is yet to finalise how many of its 59 stores will close. Under a restructuring plan drawn up by the previous owners of House of Fraser\u2019s 31 stores were scheduled to shut, but Ashley pledged to reduce the number of closures to a dozen, partly by turning over floors of larger shops to Sports Direct or his upmarket Flannels chain. Sports Direct has formally reversed plans to shut the House of Fraser flagship on Oxford Street in central London as well as a number of other branches including Plymouth, Darlington and Middlesbrough. But a spokesman told the Press Association on Tuesday that time was running out for deals to be struck. \u201cSome landlords are being very collaborative in order to give us a chance at turning the business around, giving House of Fraser a lifeline and saving hundreds of jobs,\u201d said the House of Fraser spokesman. \u201cHowever, some greedy landlords would rather see the stores close than help save the jobs of hundreds of people. We will continue to try and convince these landlords but ultimately time is running out. Some closures will be announced.\u201d The relationship between retailers and property firms has been tested to its limits this year by a spate of administrations and company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), an insolvency procedure used to close unprofitable stores and cut rent bills. Carpetright, Mothercare and New Look have been among the struggling household names to have used CVAs, with Homebase the latest retailer to propose one. On Friday, the DIY chain\u2019s creditors will vote on a plan that would result in 42 store closures. Melanie Leech, the chief executive of the British Property Federation, said the negotiations between House of Fraser and its landlords were a two-party process and \u201cone party simply can\u2019t cry \u2018unfair\u2019 \u2026 when it doesn\u2019t get what it wants\u201d. It is understood that some landlords have been reluctant to agree meagre proposals tabled by Sports Direct, which have included rent-free deals where only occupational costs such as business rates would be covered. \u201cMany property owners are investing in and managing property on behalf of pensioners\u2019 savings and depend on occupiers being able to pay rent,\u201d said Leech. \u201cThe long-term health of our high streets also depends on this. There will be a range of factors to consider on a store-by-store basis but what property owners won\u2019t be doing is simply leaving stores empty for the sake of it, that would be in no one\u2019s interests.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Almost a fifth of Britain\u2019s biggest companies have been placed on the \u201cnamed and shamed\u201d list of firms that pay their bosses excessive amounts despite shareholder rebellions. The number of FTSE 100 companies placed on the government-backed public register rose from nine in 2017 to 18 in 2018. Firms are added to the list if their pay policies attract dissent from more than 20% of shareholders at their annual meetings. Chris Cummings, the chief executive of the Investment Association, which compiles the list, said the increase in the number of FTSE 100 pay rebellions was \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d. \u201cShareholders clearly remain unimpressed with the approach to pay last year, and are frustrated the message is not getting through to some boardrooms. FTSE 100 companies must do more to ensure the pay packets of their top team align with company performance and remain at levels that shareholders find acceptable.\u201d The biggest pay rebellions this year were at the Russian gold mining firm Petropavlovsk, Royal Mail, and the housebuilding company Persimmon. Jeff Fairburn, the head of Persimmon, was paid \u00a375m despite 48.5% of shareholders voting against the award and describing it as \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d and \u201ctotally and utterly unjustifiable\u201d. He subsequently gave up some of his bonus but was still by far the highest paid FTSE 100 executive. Theresa May last year ordered the creation of the world\u2019s first public register of companies that ignored shareholder concerns and awarded \u201cpay rises to bosses that far outstrip the company\u2019s performance\u201d. She said bosses collecting vast sums for mediocre performance risked damaging \u201cthe social fabric of our country\u201d, and that calling out firms publicly would help tackle the \u201cabuses and excess in the boardroom\u201d. While shareholder anger at executive pay in the FTSE 100 has increased, the number of rebellions across companies in the wider FTSE All-Share index fell from 68 to 61. The business minister Kelly Tolhurst said: \u201cShareholder revolts on pay fell this year but it is right that shareholders are able to send a strong signal when they aren\u2019t satisfied that executive pay is in line with performance. \u201cThis register is one of a package of reforms by the government to upgrade our corporate governance, including board diversity and CEO pay ratio reporting, to make our largest companies more transparent and accountable to their staff and shareholders.\u201d The number of shareholder rebellions against re-election of directors increased significantly from 38 in 2017 to 61 in 2018. \u201cShareholders have shown their teeth this year over FTSE 250 director re-election,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cThey are using their votes to hold individual directors to account for decisions they made on issues such as executive pay and board diversity, as well as concerns that individual directors do not have the bandwidth to fulfill their roles as they spread themselves too thinly on too many boards.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Treasury plays down reports Mark Carney has been asked to stay on", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Treasury has played down reports that Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has been approached to stay a year longer than planned to manage the potential fallout from Brexit. Officials said they \u201cdid not recognise the reporting\u201d by the London Evening Standard after the paper said Carney had been asked to stay on until 2020, while suggesting the Treasury had struggled to find suitable replacements. Carney is due to step down as governor in June next year, just months after Britain formally leaves the EU on 29 March, prompting speculation about his replacement as concerns grow over the prospects for the economy. Several international candidates have been mooted as successors. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP and leading Brexit supporter, who has been a staunch critic of the governor, said the Treasury should not extend his tenure. \u201cCarney refused [an eight-year term as governor], accepting a shorter one, which was then extended. To change it again would be ridiculous,\u201d he said. Labour MPs on the Treasury committee, which is tasked with scrutinising the appointment of the Bank\u2019s governor, said the Canadian staying would help Britain in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Rushanara Ali said it would provide continuity and Wes Streeting said: \u201cGiven the government\u2019s disastrous handling of the negotiations and increasing likelihood of a bad deal or no-deal, having an experienced governor at the helm would be incredibly reassuring.\u201d City investors welcomed the idea of Carney remaining in his post, saying it would remove an additional layer of uncertainty about economic policy once Britain has left the EU. They also praised his ability to calm the financial markets, which could be rocked by the UK crashing out without a deal. Anthony Gillham, the head of investment at Quilter Investors, said: \u201cCarney is a known quantity and would subsequently offer a degree of calm that could help to reinforce confidence at the margins.\u201d Should the speculation prove accurate, there is no guarantee the governor would accept the offer of remaining at the Bank longer than initially planned. Carney had already agreed after the Brexit vote to extend his term from five to six years, still short of the eight years governors usually serve. He has support from the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, but leading Brexiters have repeatedly criticised his leadership, arguing that under his control Threadneedle Street had produced deliberately gloomy economic forecasts before the EU referendum. They have also attacked him for his warnings over the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. The latest speculation over his future was published in the diary pages of the Evening Standard, usually reserved for gossip from around London and Westminster. The newspaper is, however, edited by the former chancellor, George Osborne, who was responsible for hiring Carney in November 2012. Hammond told journalists earlier this year that he had begun looking for candidates to replace Carney at global gatherings of economists such as the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. Andrew Sentance, an economist and former member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, has argued the new governor must not be \u201cjetted in from overseas\u201d and must have a better grasp of the UK economy than Carney. Several international candidates have nevertheless been touted, including Raghuram Rajan, the former head of the Indian central bank, and Agust\u00edn Carstens, the former governor of the Bank of Mexico. Andrew Bailey, the head of the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Bank\u2019s deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, have been named as potential domestic successors. Although it was expected the Treasury would publish a formal advert for the job in July, beginning the formal recruitment process, this has yet to happen. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \u201cWe will begin recruitment for the next governor of the Bank of England in due course.\u201d",

Several international candidates have been mooted as successors.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacob-rees-mogg\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a>, the Conservative MP and leading Brexit supporter, who has been a staunch critic of the governor, said the Treasury should not extend his tenure. \u201cCarney refused [an eight-year term as governor], accepting a shorter one, which was then extended. To change it again would be ridiculous,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Labour MPs on the Treasury committee, which is tasked with scrutinising the appointment of the Bank\u2019s governor, said the Canadian staying would help Britain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.<br></p> <p>Rushanara Ali said it would provide continuity and Wes Streeting said: \u201cGiven the government\u2019s disastrous handling of the negotiations and increasing likelihood of a bad deal or no-deal, having an experienced governor at the helm would be incredibly reassuring.\u201d</p> <p>City investors welcomed the idea of Carney remaining in his post, saying it would remove an additional layer of uncertainty about economic policy once Britain has left the EU. They also praised his ability to calm the financial markets, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/aug/09/times-running-short-for-a-deal-on-financial-contracts-before-brexit\">could be rocked by the UK crashing out without a deal</a>.</p> <p>Anthony Gillham, the head of investment at Quilter Investors, said: \u201cCarney is a known quantity and would subsequently offer a degree of calm that could help to reinforce confidence at the margins.\u201d</p> <p>Should the speculation prove accurate, there is no guarantee the governor would accept the offer of remaining at the Bank longer than initially planned. </p> <p>Carney had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/31/mark-carney-extra-year-bank-of-england-governor\">agreed after the Brexit vote to extend his term</a> from five to six years, still short of the eight years governors usually serve.</p> <p>He has support from the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, but leading Brexiters have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/mark-carney-bank-of-england-criticism-brexit-end-unless-impropriety-proved\">repeatedly criticised his leadership</a>, arguing that under his control Threadneedle Street had produced deliberately gloomy economic forecasts before the EU referendum.

      "bodyText": "News of the US-Mexico trade deal has lifted European markets, albeit the gains are limited by concerns about the other big disputes that President Trump has embarked upon, notably with China. And the fact that Canada has not yet joined the new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement is another reason for caution. Nevertheless, after making gains on Monday, Germany\u2019s Dax is currently up 0.19% and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.37%. The FTSE 100, which was closed for Monday\u2019s Bank Holiday, has added 0.5%. This is not as much as might have been expected given the FTSE was playing catch-up on the other European markets, with a stronger pound against the dollar limiting the rise. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Germany is considering giving financial aid to struggling Turkey, to avoid a full blown economic crisis in the region, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. The full story is here (\u00a3). Elsewhere here\u2019s an OECD chart from economist Rupert Seggins showing how a number of countries have performed in the second quarter in terms of GDP growth: US Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin says he hopes Canada will join the Mexico-US trade deal but if not the two will go it alone. The comments came in a interview on CNBC: The pound may be falling against the euro on yet more Brexit fears, down 0.13% at \u20ac1.1022, but it is managing to move higher against a weaker dollar. The US currency is out of favour as investors turn away towards riskier bets following the US-Mexico trade deal. So the pound is up 0.21% at $1.2918. This performance against the dollar has done nothing for the FTSE 100, which is full of international earners which benefit from a weaker pound. The index is currently up 0.3% despite the positivity around the trade situation. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said: The FTSE100 is holding its post-Bank holiday jump above 7585, but back from its 7640 best of the day. Helping risk appetite are Miners welcoming fresh USD weakness, giving metals prices a boost, coupled with a US-Mexico trade deal offering hope that Trump\u2019s trade deficit spat with Beijing could calm. Hindering the index is GBP strength vs USD, sending several defensives lower, and eclipsing higher Oil prices to keep heavyweight Energy shares offside. If Donald Trump\u2019s not-NAFTA deal works, he is unlikely to change strategy in the other trade disputes, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda: While I\u2019m sure investors would rather the deal include Canada and preserve NAFTA, this is at least a step in the right direction and could be an important first step towards it. US President Donald Trump may have rebranded the agreement as the United States \u2013 Mexico Trade Agreement due to the apparent negative connotations associated with NAFTA but I think this may be yet another attempt to drag Canada to the negotiating table and align themselves with his idea of how it should look. Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a key feature of his presidency and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get what he wants. So far, he has had limited success with China, the EU and his NAFTA partners but coming ahead of the midterm elections, this could be viewed as an important success. While the US consumer may be the primary loser in his approach and the outcome of it due to the impact it has on prices, he is receiving credit for fighting to preserve skilled US jobs. Whether such perception will be enough to secure him a second term will be determined in a couple of years but it does appear to be working in his favour so far. From an investor perspective, the economy is still booming and in coming to an agreement with Mexico, one trade risk has been effectively removed and for now, that is good news. While there are some notable data pieces out later in the week, politics is likely to continue to be a driving force in the markets. The threat of a US-initiated trade war has dragged on markets for most of the year, with tax reform helping to offset this and prevent too significant a drop in the US. With progress being made, the S&amp;P 500 hitting new record highs and stocks now in their longest ever bull run, the environment seems perfect for Trump to continue to pressure the countries trade partners and force concessions so I don\u2019t expect any change in strategy any time soon. Here\u2019s an interesting report from the London Evening Standard. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has apparently been asked to stay on by the government for an extra year, until 2020, the paper says, so he can give some continuity as the country stumbles its way through Brexit. The Standard is edited these days by former UK chancellor George Osborne, the man who unveiled Carney\u2019s appointment in 2012. US markets are expected to continue their positive run when trading begins, with the futures pointing to a 40 point or so rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Indices are steady this morning after the long weekend for the UK, but the new highs in the US have not emboldened buyers this side of the Atlantic. In the short run, the market is a momentum machine, and this is being clearly demonstrated as the US market diverges from Europe, leaving the FTSE and others trailing far behind. Still, progress on trade talks is welcome for all concerned, since it shows that the Donald can be persuaded if the right approach is used. Trade negotiators around the globe will be studying the US/Mexico talks for tips on how to get on the president\u2019s good side. Further dollar weakness is continuing to bolster the euro and sterling, providing another headwind for European stocks to deal with. But with US GDP tomorrow and non-farms coming up next week this near-term weakness in the greenback may soon reverse \u2013 and while this will help the FTSE on the sterling front, a higher dollar will hit commodity prices, limiting potential upside for the index, suggesting those looking for gains will keep their money stateside. Over in the eurozone, Italian 10 year government bond yields have hit a three month high on worries about the country\u2019s spending plans and its debt levels. Italian deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio told the Il Fatto Quotidiano today that its public deficit could top the EU\u2019s ceiling of 3% of GDP next year. Jim Reid at Deutsche Bank said: Italian politicians seems to have continued to escalate their rhetoric regarding potential budget conflict with the European Union. Deputy Prime Minister Di Maio, leader of the Five Star Movement, said that Italy has no intention of withdrawing from the union or the currency zone, but that \u201cwe will look at all measures in discussions regarding the European budget and will block what doesn\u2019t work for us.\u201d The other Deputy Prime Minister, from the Northern League, Matteo Salvini, echoed Di Maio\u2019s sentiments, saying \u201cit\u2019s time to cut financing to a useless entity.\u201d The principle point of contention is immigration policy, with Italian leaders arguing that the rest of Europe needs to do more to assist Italy with their influx of migrants. The US-Mexico deal is welcome but gives little indication as to the outcome of the current dispute between Trump\u2019s government and China, suggests Alejo Czerwonko, emerging market strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management: Today\u2019s developments constitute a step in the right direction towards a revamped and modernized NAFTA. The road to a final agreement remains rocky. Several thorny issues must still be ironed out once Canada joins discussions. The most important of these involve the dispute resolution mechanism, government procurement, and agriculture. In addition, a final deal will have to be approved by each country\u2019s legislature. Although the exact timing is uncertain, we expect the countries to ultimately reach a trilateral deal, avoiding the serious consequences that would have resulted from President Trump carrying out his threat to withdraw from NAFTA... Importantly, we warn against extrapolating NAFTA optimism to the realm of US-China bilateral relationships. Trump administration documents demonstrate that current concerns about China reach beyond the narrow issue of trade, suggesting they are not going to dissipate easily. We recently reduced the size of our overweight position in global equities, bringing our overall global tactical asset allocation stance to broadly neutral. A key reason for our risk reduction was our view that the market was not pricing in the increased risk of the US-China tariff issue. Talks between China and the US have yielded little progress in recent days, and the US is still on track to impose 10\u201325% tariffs on $200bn of trade with China, and has threatened more. While we expect US-China tensions to persist over the medium term, a near-term de-escalation cannot be ruled out. In the months ahead, a reduction in trade risks or improving valuations may increase the risk/ reward for global equities. Comments from UK prime minister Theresa May on a no-deal Brexit have also done the pound little favours, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, while Chinese concerns have tempered the market enthusiasm for the Mexico deal: Though tentatively positive, the European markets hardly went doolally for Donald Trump\u2019s trade deal with Mexico, any good will tempered by a) the unresolved, and tense situation with Canada, and b) the even more unresolved, and even more tense situation with China. The FTSE, somewhat playing catch-up after Monday\u2019s Bank Holiday, jumped 0.6% after the bell, striking 7625 for the first time in nearly a fortnight. The miners played a key role in driving the UK index higher, having been something of a pest for the FTSE in recent weeks, with added gains in the banking sector. A lack of movement from the pound likely aided the FTSE\u2019s Tuesday rise. Cable sat flat the wrong side of $1.29, while against the euro sterling slipped 0.1%, the currency pinned back by Theresa May\u2019s remarkably chilled approach to a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit, with the PMI stating that such an outcome \u2018wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world\u2019. The Eurozone indices weren\u2019t quite as enthusiastic as their UK peer on Tuesday, having climbed a fair amount on Monday. The DAX added another 30 or so points, and, a smidge shy of 12600 is sitting at its best price for 18 days; the CAC, meanwhile, started fairly flat, but is nevertheless knocking on the door of 5500. After a long weekend in the UK, traders have pushed the pound down to a one year low against the euro on continuing fears of a no-deal Brexit. Among the headlines prompting concern, French prime minister Edouard Phillipe has reportedly asked ministers to prepare contingency plans for no deal. So sterling fell to a 12 month low of 90.73p although it has recovered slightly to 90.60p, down 0.01%. With the dollar weaker as the US-Mexico trade deal sends investors into riskier assets, the pound has managed to edge 0.07% higher to $1.2900. Against a basket of currencies, the US currency dipped 0.03% to 94.74. As expected, the US-Mexico deal has eased some of the trade tensions which have been building up for months now thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s confrontational approach to the issue. So the FTSE 100 is up 0.56%, Germany\u2019s Dax is 0.3% better and France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.2%. Continuing worries about the stand-off with China however are likely to limit the gains. Here are IG\u2019s opening calls for Europe: Trade tensions have been hanging over the market, and the deal with Mexico is certainly a step in the right direction, says David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets. But there is still China of course. Madden says: Traders are still mindful that the US-China talks last week didn\u2019t achieve much. It would appear that the trade spat will rumble on and there is chatter in the markets that the US is eyeing up another round of tariffs on Chinese goods, but this time it could be up to $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The US department of agriculture has plans to financially support farmers who have been targeted by Beijing\u2019s tariffs, and this initiative suggests how determined Washington DC is to maintain a hard-line. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. For once there is some positive news on the US and trade. Having gone toe to toe with China and Europe over tariffs, President Trump has now agreed a new trade deal with Mexico (despite the wall he is so keen to build between the two countries). Trump had threatened to rip up the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the two countries and Canada, but this new deal with Mexico has eased the uncertainty and put pressure on Canada to also sign up. However Trump has said he could still put tariffs on Canadian made cars if it refuses to agree to the new deal and also wants concessions on the country\u2019s dairy products. So the prospect of a trade war between the two countries has not yet gone away. In typical fashion Trump boasted about how great the new deal was, and also said the NAFTA name would be ditched: We\u2019ll get rid of the name Nafta. It has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by Nafta for many years and it\u2019s now a really good deal for both countries...I think it is one of the largest trade deals ever made \u2013 maybe the largest trade deal ever made. Economist Paul Donovan at UBS said: US President Trump declared an end to NAFTA and proposed a not-NAFTA deal with Mexico (which looks a lot like NAFTA). Canada is not yet included, and effectively has until Friday to sign up. Markets have treated this as progress, and a sign that the free trade system on which US companies depend will not be abandoned. Details do remain limited \u2013 it is hard to fit the complexities of a trade deal into a tweet. However, this is not risk free. Not-NAFTA will require Congressional approval, and without Canada, fast track authority probably cannot be used. This does not have a bearing on the Chinese trade negotiations (which do not appear to be going that well). Not-NAFTA lies somewhere between the EU negotiations (keeping things as they were) and China (political problems). It does stress the unpredictable nature of a policy that depends on the personal whims of the US president. Still, as Donovan indicated, the news sent US markets sharply higher, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new records and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising more than 1%. European markets are also expected to benefit, with the UK having some ground to make up after the Bank Holiday weekend. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: London returns from a three-day weekend and the FTSE has some catching up to do after a positive close for European markets on Monday. A strong finish in the US amid better news on trade is setting Europe up for a higher open... If the deal with Mexico is a sign of things to come, emerging markets are more attractive from a valuation standpoint- but the US still has all the momentum. There is clearly bemusement amongst many economists that the rising tariffs are not causing greater concern for US investors. We think, from the beginning it has been clear investors believe there can only be one winner any these disputes and that is the US. While emerging markets, including China have fallen into bear market territory, the record US bull market presses onwards. Elsewhere it looks like another fairly quiet day on the corporate and economic front, but we\u2019ll be keeping tabs on developments as they happen.",

So the pound is up 0.21% at $1.2918.</p> <p>This performance against the dollar has done nothing for the FTSE 100, which is full of international earners which benefit from a weaker pound. The index is currently up 0.3% despite the positivity around the trade situation. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The FTSE100 is holding its post-Bank holiday jump above 7585, but back from its 7640 best of the day. Helping risk appetite are Miners welcoming fresh USD weakness, giving metals prices a boost, coupled with a US-Mexico trade deal offering hope that Trump\u2019s trade deficit spat with Beijing could calm. Hindering the index is GBP strength vs USD, sending several defensives lower, and eclipsing higher Oil prices to keep heavyweight Energy shares offside.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8530b8e4b0bdafc162772d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-28T11:25:00.090Z\">12.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>If Donald Trump\u2019s not-NAFTA deal works, he is unlikely to change strategy in the other trade disputes, says Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While I\u2019m sure investors would rather the deal include Canada and preserve NAFTA, this is at least a step in the right direction and could be an important first step towards it. US President Donald Trump may have rebranded the agreement as the United States \u2013 Mexico Trade Agreement due to the apparent negative connotations associated with NAFTA but I think this may be yet another attempt to drag Canada to the negotiating table and align themselves with his idea of how it should look. </p> <p>Trump has made renegotiating trade deals a key feature of his presidency and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get what he wants. So far, he has had limited success with China, the EU and his NAFTA partners but coming ahead of the midterm elections, this could be viewed as an important success. While the US consumer may be the primary loser in his approach and the outcome of it due to the impact it has on prices, he is receiving credit for fighting to preserve skilled US jobs. </p> <p>Whether such perception will be enough to secure him a second term will be determined in a couple of years but it does appear to be working in his favour so far. From an investor perspective, the economy is still booming and in coming to an agreement with Mexico, one trade risk has been effectively removed and for now, that is good news. </p> <p>While there are some notable data pieces out later in the week, politics is likely to continue to be a driving force in the markets. The threat of a US-initiated trade war has dragged on markets for most of the year, with tax reform helping to offset this and prevent too significant a drop in the US. With progress being made, the S&amp;P 500 hitting new record highs and stocks now in their longest ever bull run, the environment seems perfect for Trump to continue to pressure the countries trade partners and force concessions so I don\u2019t expect any change in strategy any time soon.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b8523fde4b0b69fd6c571ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-28T10:32:44.145Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s an interesting report from the London Evening Standard.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/the-londoner-bank-chief-carney-asked-to-stay-a-year-a3921451.html\">Bank of England governor Mark Carney has apparently been asked to stay on by the government for an extra year,</a> until 2020, the paper says, so he can give some continuity as the country stumbles its way through Brexit.</p> <p>The Standard is edited these days by former UK chancellor George Osborne, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/26/mark-carney-bank-of-england-governor\">the man who unveiled Carney\u2019s appointment in 2012.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b38c0e8e476de849956d3948ba1f4a4c7ca4acf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b38c0e8e476de849956d3948ba1f4a4c7ca4acf/0_102_3858_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carney and Osborne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carney and Osborne.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-08-28T10:34:27.796Z\">at 11.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5b8511d6e4b0447fbe86106a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-08-28T09:33:20.565Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets are expected to continue their positive run when trading begins, with the futures pointing to a 40 point or so rise on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Having gone toe to toe with China and Europe over tariffs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/27/trump-nafta-us-mexico-trade-understanding-latest\">President Trump has now agreed a new trade deal with Mexico</a> (despite the wall he is so keen to build between the two countries).</p> <p>Trump had threatened to rip up the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the two countries and Canada, but this new deal with Mexico has eased the uncertainty and put pressure on Canada to also sign up.</p> <p>However Trump has said he could still put tariffs on Canadian made cars if it refuses to agree to the new deal and also wants concessions on the country\u2019s dairy products. So the prospect of a trade war between the two countries has not yet gone away.</p> <p>In typical fashion Trump boasted about how great the new deal was, and also said the NAFTA name would be ditched:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ll get rid of the name Nafta. It has a bad connotation because the United States was hurt very badly by Nafta for many years and it\u2019s now a really good deal for both countries...I think it is one of the largest trade deals ever made \u2013 maybe the largest trade deal ever made.</p> </blockquote> <p>Economist Paul Donovan at UBS said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US President Trump declared an end to NAFTA and proposed a not-NAFTA deal with Mexico (which looks a lot like NAFTA). Canada is not yet included, and effectively has until Friday to sign up.</p> <p>Markets have treated this as progress, and a sign that the free trade system on which US companies depend will not be abandoned. Details do remain limited \u2013 it is hard to fit the complexities of a trade deal into a tweet. However, this is not risk free. Not-NAFTA will require Congressional approval, and without Canada, fast track authority probably cannot be used.</p> <p>This does not have a bearing on the Chinese trade negotiations (which do not appear to be going that well). Not-NAFTA lies somewhere between the EU negotiations (keeping things as they were) and China (political problems). It does stress the unpredictable nature of a policy that depends on the personal whims of the US president. </p> </blockquote> <p>Still, as Donovan indicated, the news sent US markets sharply higher, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting new records and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising more than 1%.</p> <p>European markets are also expected to benefit, with the UK having some ground to make up after the Bank Holiday weekend. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>London returns from a three-day weekend and the FTSE has some catching up to do after a positive close for European markets on Monday. A strong finish in the US amid better news on trade is setting Europe up for a higher open... </p> <p>If the deal with Mexico is a sign of things to come, emerging markets are more attractive from a valuation standpoint- but the US still has all the momentum. There is clearly bemusement amongst many economists that the rising tariffs are not causing greater concern for US investors. We think, from the beginning it has been clear investors believe there can only be one winner any these disputes and that is the US. While emerging markets, including China have fallen into bear market territory, the record US bull market presses onwards. </p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere it looks like another fairly quiet day on the corporate and economic front, but we\u2019ll be keeping tabs on developments as they happen.</p> </div>   </div>",

    "webTitle": "Number of Australians living below poverty line has not declined since 1980s", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Despite 27 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the number of Australians living below the poverty line has failed to decline since the late 1980s, the Productivity Commission has found. Peter Harris, the commission\u2019s chairman, says the finding is serious and ought to demand the attention of Australia\u2019s political leaders. It was clear that years of policy tinkering have failed to help the persistently disadvantaged, he said, so if the major political parties wanted to respond to the popular view that the benefits of growth were not being shared they could perhaps focus on that problem. \u201cPerhaps simply shifting money around and doing more of the same is not sufficient,\u201d he warned. The Productivity Commission launched a new report, Rising Inequality? A stocktake of the evidence, which considers the latest evidence on trends in inequality, poverty and disadvantage. It shows that 9% of Australians, or 2.2 million people, experienced relative income poverty (income below 50% of the median) in 2015-16, with children and older people having the highest rates of relative income poverty. That aggregate figure has fluctuated since 1988-89, it says, but despite 27 years of uninterrupted growth has not declined. Harris said the finding was concerning because despite \u201csignificant investment\u201d in redistribution of income in recent decades \u2013 including family tax benefits and childcare assistance, and a boost to indexation in the age pension \u2013 the proportion of Australians living below the poverty line ought to have reduced. \u201cFor 2 million or so people, we are where we were 30 years ago,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSo as political parties ask themselves, \u2018What are good ways to respond to the popular view that the benefits of growth are not being shared?\u2019, rather than narrow their search to a preferred or favourable statistical model of inequality, perhaps it might be a lot better to focus instead on persistently disadvantaged elements of this group.\u201d Harris said income and wealth inequality were not traditional areas of focus for the Productivity Commission, so it was wading into contested waters with the report. But the report\u2019s purpose was to create a foundation for an informed discussion about inequality and its social impacts, by taking stock of the most complete evidence measuring trends in inequality, poverty and disadvantage in Australia via multiple means. \u201cNo single metric is sufficient to give a definitive answer to the seemingly straightforward question: have inequality, poverty and disadvantage in Australia risen, fallen or remained steady in recent years?\u201d the report says. \u201cOur focus, therefore, eschews the specific and often self-serving use of any one measure of inequality.\u201d The report says most developed countries have experienced rising income inequality since the late 1980s, and at a faster pace than in Australia. Australia\u2019s progressive tax system and highly targeted transfer system substantially reduce income inequality, the report says, keeping Australia\u2019s level of inequality close to the OECD country average. The Australian Bureau of Statistics Household Expenditure Survey and Survey of Income and Housing indicate that income inequality has increased slightly between 1988-89 and 2015-16. It was relatively flat through the 1990s but shifted upwards during the mining boom and stabilised after the global financial crisis. But the report shows wealth inequality has increased notably since the early 2000s. Average equivalised household wealth rose by 43% in the 12 years to 2015-16, it shows, to just under $530,000, with gains across the distribution, but growth was stronger for the top half of the distribution, with owner-occupied housing and superannuation balances accounting for most of the increase in wealth. \u201cThe person at the 90th percentile of the wealth distribution has almost 40 times as much wealth as the person at the 10th percentile; for income, they have four times as much,\u201d the report says. The Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O\u2019Neil, said: \u201cThis report proves what working people in Australia experience every day. Our bills are increasing but our income isn\u2019t keeping up. Meanwhile corporations and the very wealthy are doing better than ever.\u201d",

It deepens an existing relationship in a bid to catch up with rivals in the race to design and produce autonomous vehicles for the mass market. The aim of the partnership is to use technology from both companies in purpose-built Toyota cars to be deployed across Uber\u2019s ride-sharing network from 2021. Toyota\u2019s investment values Uber at $72bn, despite mounting losses that totalled $4.5bn in 2017. Shigeki Tomoyama, the executive vice-president of Toyota, said: \u201cThis agreement and investment marks an important milestone in our transformation to a mobility company as we help provide a path for safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride-sharing that includes Toyota vehicles and technologies.\u201d The deal is a step towards the revival of Uber\u2019s self-driving business after a fatal crash in Tempe, Arizona, in March, when a self-driving Uber SUV killed a pedestrian. Uber subsequently withdrew its autonomous cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and closed its self-driving testing hub in Arizona. Under the latest deal with Toyota, Uber will combine its autonomous driving system with Toyota\u2019s Guardian technology, which offers some automated safety features such as lane-keeping but does not enable a vehicle to entirely self-driven. The firms said the ambition was to build the combined technology into Toyota\u2019s Sienna minivans, to be used on Uber\u2019s ride-hailing network from 2021. They will be playing catch-up with a range of rivals, including Waymo, the driverless car business of Alphabet, the owner of Google. Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, said it was the first deal of its kind for the firm. \u201cOur goal is to deploy the world\u2019s safest self-driving cars on the Uber network and this agreement is another significant step towards making that a reality.

      "bodyText": "Britain should limit the windfall gains of landowners by freezing the value of plots newly designated for housing, according to a thinktank urging sweeping reforms to tackle a national shortage of affordable homes. Calling on the government to pursue land market reforms similar to the German model, the Institute for Public Policy Research said planning authorities should be given new powers to zone land for development and freeze its price. It said speculation by landowners awaiting planning decisions that can trigger vast increases in the value of a plot, had the effect of exacerbating wealth inequality and was a \u201cdriving force behind the broken housing market\u201d in Britain. Luke Murphy, associate director at IPPR, said: \u201cConventional wisdom suggests that the UK has a problem with house prices, but the reality is that we have a problem with land.\u201d The sweeping reforms would mean national and local government organisations would benefit from the extra value generated by planning decisions, which could be used for local infrastructure or affordable housing, rather than landowners accruing massive returns from the state approving changes in the use of land. Using the example of a hectare of agricultural land in Oxfordshire that would typically be worth about \u00a325,000, the IPPR said it could skyrocket in value by more than 200 times on approval for residential development to be worth about \u00a35.6m. While the landowner stands to benefit from approval, the increase drives up the cost of building homes. Two years ago on average the price of land had risen to more than 70% of the price paid for a house, which the IPPR said could rise to about 83% over the next two decades given current trends in the housing market. Options to remedy the problem could include councils buying land and selling at higher prices to developers, or entering into partnerships with landowners to share the proceeds of the sale. About half of net wealth in Britain is tied in up in land, having risen by more than 500% in the past two decades to stand at \u00a35tn. Although the value of property built on land across the country has also risen, it has increased at a much slower rate, of around 219%. According to a 2010 report for Country Life, a third of Britain\u2019s land still belongs to the aristocracy, while some of the oldest families in the country have held on to their land for several centuries. The IPPR said the top 10% own property wealth averaging \u00a3420,000 in value, compared with the bottom 30% who own no net property wealth at all. Murphy said: \u201cWealth inequality, a poorly functioning housing market, an economy focused on unproductive investment and macroeconomic instability are all negative consequences of our current speculative land market.\u201d The idea of taxing land values or giving councils other powers to benefit from planning approval windfalls has gathered increasing favour in recent years. Adopting the German model for freezing the gains of landowners was put forward three years ago by the Policy Network thinktank headed by Peter Mandelson. While market intervention has often been associated with the left, increasingly radical ideas are also finding favour among Conservatives concerned that falling numbers of homeowners will subtract from their voter base. Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, used a newspaper column earlier this month to attack construction companies reducing the supply of new homes by \u201cland-banking,\u201d where firms sit on land without building anything to protect new housing supply flooding the market all at once, thereby maintaining higher prices.",

      "bodyText": "Pound reaches record low for 2018 Fears over a no-deal Brexit sent the pound to the lowest level against the dollar and the euro this year, as Theresa May continued to struggle to gain support for her plan for Britain leaving the EU. Speculation against the pound has intensified over the course of the past month as markets have digested warnings from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and leading Brexit backers arguing the UK would be prepared to walk away from Brussels without a deal. FTSE 100 falters amid trade tensions The FTSE 100 lost ground over the course of the last month, amid renewed tensions over Donald Trump\u2019s trade tariffs on Chinese imports and concerns over the fallout from an unfolding economic crisis in Turkey. The Turkish lira plunged by more than 20% against the dollar earlier in August, after Trump said he would double tariffs on Turkish imports to the US, amid a diplomatic row over an imprisoned American pastor. The weak pound has helped support the FTSE 100, as many of the largest firms in the index derive much of their profit from overseas. The leading index of UK company shares has dropped by about 1% in the past month. Meets forecast Higher petrol prices drive inflation increase The rising price of petrol triggered the first increase in inflation this year, placing renewed pressure on household budgets. The consumer prices index hit an annual rate of 2.5% last month, after holding at 2.4% in the previous three months, thanks to high global energy prices. The July reading for the retail price index, used for the setting of rail fire increases, rose at 3.2%, lower than the 3.4% in June but still triggering outrage from commuters after multiple cancellations for services across the country this year. Better than forecast Trade deficit narrows The UK\u2019s trade deficit \u2013 how much imports exceed exports \u2013 narrowed slightly, despite falling exports of car and aircraft amid weaker manufacturing output in Britain. The trade in goods deficit shrank to \u00a311.4bn in June from \u00a312.5bn in the previous month, beating economists\u2019 forecasts for a deficit of about \u00a312bn. The overall UK trade deficit for goods and services widened by \u00a34.7bn to reach \u00a38.6bn in the three months to June as fears mounted about the impact of Trump\u2019s trade tariffs on Europe and the rest of the world. Worse than forecast Surveys point towards slowing growth There were weaker readings for the British economy from closely watched surveys of business activity, pointing towards a surprise fall in output for the UK\u2019s dominant services industry. The latest snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply purchasing managers\u2019 index for the sector fell from 55.1 in June to 53.5 last month against expectations for a more modest decline to 54.7. Anything above 50 indicates expansion versus contraction. The PMI for the manufacturing sector also pointed towards slowing growth, while the construction industry continued a recovery after suffering amid heavy snowfall earlier this year. Worse than forecast Pay growth drops despite record unemployment The rate of pay growth for British workers unexpectedly dropped to its weakest in almost a year, despite a fall in unemployment to a new 43-year low and the biggest drop in workers from the EU since modern records began. The Office for National Statistics said average weekly earnings rose by 2.4% on the year in the three months to June, down from the previous three months when they grew by 2.5% and falling short of economists\u2019 forecasts for the rate to remain unchanged. The worrying trend from the labour market confounds Bank of England expectations for rising pay, with the jobless rate falling from 4.2% to 4%, the lowest level since the winter of 1974-75. Better than forecast Heatwave and World Cup boosts retail sales England\u2019s extended World Cup run and the continued summer heatwave provided an unexpected lift for retail sales in July, as consumers bought more food and drink from supermarkets. Providing breathing space for many struggling retailers, sales volumes rose by 0.7% last month from June, and were 3.5% higher than a year earlier, beating economists\u2019 forecasts for a 0.2% monthly rise and a 3% annual gain. However, there are warnings the underlying trend for weaker sales since the EU referendum and the switch to online shopping is unlikely to reverse a trend for shop closures and redundancies across the sector. Better than forecast Public finances hand Hammond wiggle room Britain recorded the biggest July budget surplus in 18 years, welcoming news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, as he considers ways to pay for the promised increase in NHS funding. The ONS reported public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, went into surplus for July by \u00a32bn, comfortably beating City analysts\u2019 forecasts. The latest figures show government borrowing for the financial year so far is around \u00a38.5bn below the same point last year, which could give Hammond more room for manoeuvre at the autumn budget. Meets forecast House prices edge higher House prices showed signs of gradually edging higher last month, despite falling values in London and landlords quitting the private rental market. The latest snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors house price index, measuring the balance of surveyors expecting price rises against those forecasting a fall, rose to +4 in July from an upwardly revised +3 a month ago, matching economists\u2019 expectations. Somewhat faster price rises are expected by surveyors in the next 12 months, but sales volumes are falling at the fastest rate since October. And another thing we\u2019ve learned this month \u2026 Interest rates are gradually rising again The Bank of England raised rates, ushering in a new era of higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses only months before Britain leaves the EU. Threadneedle Street raised its key interest rate to 0.75% from 0.5%, while some economists believe there will be further increases ahead. Economists at the City bank Berenberg forecast rates could reach 1.5% by the end of 2020. However, Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal could cause the Bank to stage an emergency rate cut. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, warned a no-deal scenario would be \u201chighly undesirable\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Sentance Senior economic adviser at the PwC consultancy and member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee from 2006 to 2011 Though GDP growth picked up in the second quarter of this year, it would be premature to conclude that the Brexit-induced slowdown in the UK economy is coming to an end. Some of the bounceback in GDP growth in the spring and early summer represents a catch-up after the weather-affected first quarter. Over the past 12 months, GDP growth has been just 1.3%. Inflation picked up slightly in July \u2013 to 2.5% \u2013 and is likely to remain stuck around this level in the months ahead. That will put a dampener on the growth of consumer spending, even though recent retail sales figures have been encouraging. The weakness of sterling on the foreign exchanges is likely to further delay the fallback in CPI inflation to the 2% target. Meanwhile, talk of a no-deal Brexit will add further to the uncertainty which has been holding back business investment since the beginning of 2016. Slower job growth is consistent with this picture of continued subdued economic activity. In the second quarter, total employment increased by just 0.1% relative to the first quarter. Since the EU referendum, employment has increased on average by 1% a year, compared with nearly 2% annual growth from the beginning of 2014 until mid-2016. Though the unemployment rate has continued to fall, and now stands at just 4%, the boost to the labour supply from migration has tailed off dramatically. The number of EU nationals working in the UK has dropped by 86,000 over the past 12 months \u2013 the largest annual fall recorded for more than 20 years. These dampening influences on economic growth, however, did not prevent the Bank of England monetary policy committee from raising interest rates this month and the committee was right to do so. Interest rates have been held at emergency levels for too long in the UK. A policy of slow and gradual rate rises should not significantly dampen growth \u2013 as the experience of the US demonstrates. A firmer commitment from the MPC to future rate rises could help the pound and relieve some of the inflationary squeeze which consumers are currently facing from higher import prices. David Blanchflower Professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from 2006 to 2009 The big news of the month was the increase in rates by the Bank of England, which was a major error that will inevitably have to be reversed. The UK economy has grown only 0.6% in the first half of 2018 and the rate rise will slow growth even further. I can see no data from the real world that sustains a rate rise. If anything the evidence suggests a rate cut would have been more appropriate because of the downside risks to the economy from Brexit. A potential trade war also is likely to make output lower and Europe is slowing. Further rate rises would be nothing short of disastrous. Surveys point to a slowing of the UK economy. The purchasing manager indices for manufacturing and services were weak. A survey by the Institute of Directors revealed that business leaders\u2019 confidence in the economy has fallen to its lowest point in 2018. Uncertainty around trade with the EU was a major concern of business leaders. Directors in large organisations tended to be more downbeat about the economy than those in small and medium-sized enterprises. The biggest concern overall was UK economic conditions. One of the major reasons the MPC cited for rate rises was their expectation that wage growth and settlements were set to explode to around 4%. This is the 19th forecast in a row that they have said that. They have said the same every quarter since the beginning of 2014 and have not learned anything and every single time they have been wrong. It didn\u2019t take two weeks this time for them to look clueless. This week the pay experts XpertHR reported that wage settlements had slowed in the three months to 2.3% in July from 2.5%. The ONS also reported that wage growth slowed sharply \u2013 from 2.5% in May to 2.1% in June and 2.0% in the private sector. The fact that the MPC seems to have no idea what it is doing is a major concern. This is not going to end well. Most people would have been fired for being wrong five or even 10 times in a row let alone 19.",

Inflation picked up slightly in July \u2013 to 2.5% \u2013 and is likely to remain stuck around this level in the months ahead. That will put a dampener on the growth of consumer spending, even though recent retail sales figures have been encouraging.</p> <p>The weakness of sterling on the foreign exchanges is likely to further delay the fallback in <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices\">CPI inflation</a> to the 2% target. Meanwhile, talk of a no-deal Brexit will add further to the uncertainty which has been holding back business investment since the beginning of 2016.</p> <p>Slower job growth is consistent with this picture of continued subdued economic activity. In the second quarter, total employment increased by just 0.1% relative to the first quarter.<br></p> <p>Since the EU referendum, employment has increased on average by 1% a year, compared with nearly 2% annual growth from the beginning of 2014 until mid-2016. Though the unemployment rate has continued to fall, and now stands at just 4%, the boost to the labour supply from migration has tailed off dramatically.</p> <p>The number of EU nationals working in the UK has dropped by 86,000 over the past 12 months \u2013 the largest annual fall recorded for more than 20 years.</p> <p>These dampening influences on economic growth, however, did not prevent the Bank of England monetary policy committee from raising interest rates this month and the committee was right to do so. Interest rates have been held at emergency levels for too long in the UK. A policy of slow and gradual rate rises should not significantly dampen growth \u2013 as the experience of the US demonstrates.</p> <p>A firmer commitment from the MPC to future rate rises could help the pound and relieve some of the inflationary squeeze which consumers are currently facing from higher import prices.</p> <h2><strong>David Blanchflower</strong></h2> <p><strong>Professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, and member of the Bank\u2019s MPC from 2006 to 2009</strong></p> <p>The big news of the month was the increase in rates by the Bank of England, which was a major error that will inevitably have to be reversed. The UK economy has grown only 0.6% in the first half of 2018 and the rate rise will slow growth even further.</p> <p>I can see no data from the real world that sustains a rate rise. If anything the evidence suggests a rate cut would have been more appropriate because of the downside risks to the economy from Brexit. A potential trade war also is likely to make output lower and Europe is slowing. Further rate rises would be nothing short of disastrous.</p> <p>Surveys point to a slowing of the UK economy. The purchasing manager indices for manufacturing and services were weak. A survey by the Institute of Directors revealed that business leaders\u2019 confidence in the economy has fallen to its lowest point in 2018. Uncertainty around trade with the EU was a major concern of business leaders. Directors in large organisations tended to be more downbeat about the economy than those in small and medium-sized enterprises. The biggest concern overall was UK economic conditions.</p> <p>One of the major reasons the MPC cited for rate rises was their expectation that wage growth and settlements were set to explode to around 4%. This is the 19th forecast in a row that they have said that.</p> <p>They have said the same every quarter since the beginning of 2014 and have not learned anything and every single time they have been wrong. It didn\u2019t take two weeks this time for them to look clueless. This week the pay experts XpertHR reported that wage settlements had slowed in the three months to 2.3% in July from 2.5%. The ONS also reported that wage growth slowed sharply \u2013 from 2.5% in May to 2.1% in June and 2.0% in the private sector.</p> <p>The fact that the MPC seems to have no idea what it is doing is a major concern. This is not going to end well. Most people would have been fired for being wrong five or even 10 times in a row let alone 19.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The British economy is failing to deliver stronger growth in workers\u2019 pay, as the mounting risk of a no-deal Brexit turns up the pressure on household finances, according to a Guardian analysis of economic developments over the past month. Pay growth in Britain has dropped to its weakest in almost a year despite the unemployment rate hitting a 43-year low. At the same time, recent weakness in the pound amid the growing chance of a no-deal Brexit is poised to push up the rate of inflation, triggering a renewed squeeze on living standards. Despite some pockets of strength for the economy, there are growing signs of weakness after the Bank of England raised interest rates above the emergency level set since the financial crisis. Ushering in a new era of higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, the move comes as ministers prepare the public for Britain crashing-out of the EU without a deal with Brussels. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee, said heightened talk of a no-deal Brexit would hold back business investment, while arguing higher inflation would limit the spending power of consumers. \u201cThough GDP growth picked up in the second quarter of this year, it would be premature to conclude that the Brexit-induced slowdown in the UK economy is coming to an end,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of the referendum outcome on a monthly basis, the Guardian has chosen eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in three cases the outcome was better than expected, while two met expectations. In the latest figures, unemployment is at the lowest level since the winter of 1974-5, which should drive up the bargaining power of workers to demand higher pay. However, the annual growth rate of total pay slipped from 2.5% to 2.4% in the second quarter of the year, while regular pay growth eased from 2.8% to 2.7% even though the number of unfilled vacancies reached 829,000 and there was a fall of 86,000 in the number of EU nationals working in Britain. Writing in the Guardian, David Blanchflower, another former member of the Bank\u2019s MPC, said the present rate-setters at Threadneedle Street had been made to look clueless by the latest figures, as they had forecast wage growth would gradually accelerate. \u201cThe fact that the MPC seems to have no idea what it is doing is a major concern. This is not going to end well,\u201d he said. Rising petrol prices have driven inflation upwards for the first time this year, with the consumer price index hitting an annual rate of 2.5% last month. Weakness in sterling as Theresa May struggles to win support for her Brexit vision is likely to drive the rate higher, as foreign imports become more expensive, according to economists. There were some pockets of strength from the latest dashboard reading. Warmer weather and England\u2019s extended World Cup run appear to have encouraged greater levels of consumer spending, while record employment helped to boost the public finances from more people paying income tax. Britain recorded the biggest budget surplus in July for 18 years, giving Philip Hammond more wriggle room as he considers ways to fund the Conservatives\u2019 commitment to raise spending on the NHS by \u00a320bn. Despite economic growth in the second quarter recovering from a slowdown earlier this year, surveys of business activity pointed towards weaker levels of economic activity ahead. Britain\u2019s dominant services sector was unexpectedly weak in July, while growth in manufacturing output also dropped. Britain\u2019s factories have fallen to ninth in the world behind France, reversing a recovery in its performance since the financial crash.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The new minister for jobs and industrial relations, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, has on the surface been given an easy job. Employment growth has been strong and unemployment is now lower than it has been since the end of 2012. But while the general employment news appears quite solid, a deeper look reveals the overall picture is somewhat brittle and that along with underemployment and low wages growth, long-term unemployment is an increasing area of concern. It certainly is the case that unemployment is relatively low. The current trend rate of unemployment of 5.4% is lower than it has been for 61% of this century. But that figure reveals perhaps more than anything just how poor the unemployment rate has become at measuring the overall state of the labour market. While the current unemployment rate is looking relatively rosy compared to the recent past, the level of underemployment is higher now than it has been for around 90% of this century: And wages growth, as we all know, is also lower now than it has been for most of this century \u2013 indeed for all bar 8% of it: But the rise of underemployment and the weak wages growth are not unknown \u2013 indeed they have been concentrating the minds of policymakers for some time now. As I have noted previously, wages growth and underemployment will be a key issue for the government come the next election. If, after a period of very strong employment growth, wages remain stuck around or below the inflation rate, then voters will likely be wondering if that is as good as they can hope to get. While wages growth and underemployment have received a wealth of coverage, one area which hasn\u2019t but which points to a high degree of brittleness underneath the overall good news of the unemployment rate is that of long-term unemployment. The latest detailed labour force figures revealed that the current long-term unemployment ratio \u2013 which measures the percent of unemployed who have been looking for work for more than a year \u2013 is now at its highest rate since October 2000. More than a quarter of those who are unemployed have now been so for more than 52 weeks: Partly this is due to the fall in unemployment overall and the fact that when employment improves often it is those who have been unemployed for the least amount of time who are most likely to get a job. But even as a percentage of the entire labour force, the level of long-term unemployment is high compared to that of recent years: The intriguing thing however has been what has driven this recent increase in long-term unemployment. Basically you can divide the long-term unemployed into two groups \u2013 those who have been looking for work for one to two years, and those who have been searching for more than that time. And what the data highlights is that over the past 12 months it has been the latter category that has risen while the numbers of one-to-two-year job seekers have generally fallen: And when we look at the make-up of those who have been unemployed from more than two years, the big growth has come from older workers \u2013 especially those aged 55-64. Around half of the increase in these very long-term unemployed has come from that age group, despite them only making up around 20% of the total number of those who have been out of work for more than two years: The decline in the number of young very long-term unemployed also suggests that the issue is not one that can be solved with the standard \u201clet\u2019s give kids some training and work experience\u201d solution. It points to deeper issues, not just relating to a need for training in new industries for older workers whose place of work might have closed (such as those working in car manufacturing) but also a need to ensure employers do not see such workers as past their use-by-date. One other measure that suggests things are not as rosy as it all might seem is the unemployment rate of those looking for full-time work. While the overall unemployment rate has been falling over the past year, the unemployment rate of those looking for full-time work has remained rather steady, and the two measures have drifted apart over the past six months: As a general rule this is not a good development as periods of economic weakness have been associated with times when the unemployment rate has been much higher than that of the rate of those looking for full-time work. After a good run, where by August 2017 the two rates were level, the current gap is the biggest it has been since 2014: And while the current gap is not of the same magnitude that it was during the financial crisis or even the weak economic period of 2013, it does suggests that getting work is much easier at the moment if you are more open to working part-time, and that the spare capacity in the labour force is continuing to grow. This would suggest little likelihood of wages growth being about to improve. On one level the new jobs minister would be rather relieved, given she has moved on from having oversight of the financial sector and the horror show that has been the royal commission, as well as the problem that the government\u2019s vilification of the industry super sector has come to naught. But while the employment sector does look quite solid, there remain many problems under the surface, problems that will be a major barrier to the government\u2019s re-election chances should they stay in place.

The current trend rate of unemployment of 5.4% is lower than it has been for 61% of this century.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Unemployment rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IrxLn/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But that figure reveals perhaps more than anything just how poor the unemployment rate has become at measuring the overall state of the labour market.</p> <p>While the current unemployment rate is looking relatively rosy compared to the recent past, the level of underemployment is higher now than it has been for around 90% of this century:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Underemployment rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sDEaH/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> And wages growth, as we all know, is also lower now than it has been for most of this century \u2013 indeed for all bar 8% of it:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Wages price index - annual growth\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ij5IR/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> But the rise of underemployment and the weak wages growth are not unknown \u2013 indeed they have been concentrating the minds of policymakers for some time now.</p> <p>As I have noted previously, wages growth and underemployment will be a key issue for the government come the next election. If, after a period of very strong employment growth, wages remain stuck around or below the inflation rate, then voters will likely be wondering if that is as good as they can hope to get.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/jul/22/greg-jericho-industry-super-funds-keep-outclassing-retail-ones-but-the-attacks-dont-stop\">Industry super funds are thrashing those run by banks \u2013 and business is crying foul | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While wages growth and underemployment have received a wealth of coverage, one area which hasn\u2019t but which points to a high degree of brittleness underneath the overall good news of the unemployment rate is that of long-term unemployment.</p> <p>The latest detailed labour force figures revealed that the current long-term unemployment ratio \u2013 which measures the percent of unemployed who have been looking for work for more than a year \u2013 is now at its highest rate since October 2000. More than a quarter of those who are unemployed have now been so for more than 52 weeks:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Long-term unemployment ratio\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SuS6q/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> Partly this is due to the fall in unemployment overall and the fact that when employment improves often it is those who have been unemployed for the least amount of time who are most likely to get a job.</p> <p>But even as a percentage of the entire labour force, the level of long-term unemployment is high compared to that of recent years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Long-term unemployment rate\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZkgIf/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The intriguing thing however has been what has driven this recent increase in long-term unemployment.</p> <p>Basically you can divide the long-term unemployed into two groups \u2013 those who have been looking for work for one to two years, and those who have been searching for more than that time.</p> <p>And what the data highlights is that over the past 12 months it has been the latter category that has risen while the numbers of one-to-two-year job seekers have generally fallen:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Numbers of long-term unemployed\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5ky7e/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> And when we look at the make-up of those who have been unemployed from more than two years, the big growth has come from older workers \u2013 especially those aged 55-64. Around half of the increase in these very long-term unemployed has come from that age group, despite them only making up around 20% of the total number of those who have been out of work for more than two years:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Numbers of unemployed for more than 2 years by age\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/sh7im/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> The decline in the number of young very long-term unemployed also suggests that the issue is not one that can be solved with the standard \u201clet\u2019s give kids some training and work experience\u201d solution. It points to deeper issues, not just relating to a need for training in new industries for older workers whose place of work might have closed (such as those working in car manufacturing) but also a need to ensure employers do not see such workers as past their use-by-date.</p> <p>One other measure that suggests things are not as rosy as it all might seem is the unemployment rate of those looking for full-time work.</p> <p>While the overall unemployment rate has been falling over the past year, the unemployment rate of those looking for full-time work has remained rather steady, and the two measures have drifted apart over the past six months:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Total unemployment rate and for those looking for full-time work\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bLM0H/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> As a general rule this is not a good development as periods of economic weakness have been associated with times when the unemployment rate has been much higher than that of the rate of those looking for full-time work.</p> <p>After a good run, where by August 2017 the two rates were level, the current gap is the biggest it has been since 2014:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Spread between unemployment rate and unemployment rate of those looking for full-time work\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MGvmT/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> And while the current gap is not of the same magnitude that it was during the financial crisis or even the weak economic period of 2013, it does suggests that getting work is much easier at the moment if you are more open to working part-time, and that the spare capacity in the labour force is continuing to grow. This would suggest little likelihood of wages growth being about to improve.</p> <p>On one level the new jobs minister would be rather relieved, given she has moved on from having oversight of the financial sector and the horror show that has been the royal commission, as well as the problem that the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2018/aug/19/the-last-thing-anyone-needs-is-industry-super-acting-like-retail-funds-and-now-we-have-proof\">vilification of the industry super</a> sector has come to naught.</p> <p>But while the employment sector does look quite solid, there remain many problems under the surface, problems that will be a major barrier to the government\u2019s re-election chances should they stay in place<a href=\"xhttp://www.theguardian.com\">.</a> </p> <ul> <li>Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist</li> </ul>",
