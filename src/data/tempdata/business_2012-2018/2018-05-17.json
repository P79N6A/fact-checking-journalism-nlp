      "bodyText": "Strong oil prices and the falling value of sterling pushed Britain\u2019s main share index to its highest ever closing level on Thursday. The FTSE 100 climbed 0.7% to close at 7,787.97 points, just short of its record intraday high of 7,792.56 points hit in mid-January. The oil firms BP and Shell were among the strongest risers, along with firms that generate much of their income abroad, including Unilever and HSBC, and have benefited from the recent fall in the pound. Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro to $1.35 and \u20ac1.144, respectively. Only a month ago the pound was eight cents higher against the dollar at $1.43. However, some analysts warned against exuberance after the FTSE 100 tumbled in the spring to below 7,000 before rising again to its current record level. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at the stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe death of the bull market has been greatly exaggerated, not for the first time in recent history. The FTSE did endure a shaky start to the year but after two months of steady climbing has now regained and surpassed its previous high.\u201d He said a stronger dollar, the rising cost of oil and the postponement of an interest-rate rise by the Bank of England last week can all claim credit for the recent strong showing from the stock market. \u201cThere will come a time when the stock market will tumble again, at which point investors should take it in their stride and look beyond the immediate situation.\u201d Investors also appeared to be more relaxed about the outcome of Brexit negotiations after the prime minister indicated she had secured cabinet approval for a compromise over Britain\u2019s future trading relationship with the European Union. Theresa May said the UK would leave the customs union but with a fallback option, as yet lacking any detail, that would allay fears of a hard border with the Irish republic. The move, which looks to effectively tie the UK to EU rules for several years after an interim period up to 2020, is expected to meet stiff opposition within the Tory party and could yet be scuppered in a final vote in the Commons. FTSE 100 companies Royal Dutch Shell and BP were up 2.1% and 1.4% respectively as Brent crude broke the $80 a barrel barrier. Gambling stocks initially came under pressure following the government\u2019s decision to cut the top stake on betting terminals to \u00a32. However, they rallied later in the day higher as investors expressed relief that the regulatory uncertainty was over and focused instead on the potential opportunities in the US following a supreme court decision that allows states to set their own rules for sports gambling. FTSE 100 member Paddy Power Betfair rose 1.9%. Ladbrokes Coral parent GVC and William Hill, which operate many of Britain\u2019s 182,000 gaming machines, recovered to rise 5% and 4.2% respectively. \u201cWhilst \u00a32 max stakes is a negative for the sector, if the implementation date is pushed back past 2020, online taxes come in later and the impact to EBITDA is less bad than feared, then there may be a sense of relief today,\u201d Barclays analysts said. The highest riser on the index of top 100 companies was Experian, the world\u2019s biggest credit data company, which added 5.6% after its revenues for its full financial year grew more strongly than expected. Royal Mail was one of the few to slump, tumbling 7.2% after it warned that the decline in letter volumes may come in at the higher end of its forecast range. The mid-cap FTSE 250 index also hit a new record high, surpassing its previous mid-January record, up 0.9 per cent on the day. The retail technology firm Ocado was the biggest gainer, up nearly 45% following news of a tie-up with the US retailer Kroger.",

      "bodyText": "Ocado shares soared nearly 45% on Thursday \u2013 adding \u00a31.6bn to the value of the company \u2013 after the online grocer unveiled a major push into the US market with a deal to provide its technology to the American grocery giant Kroger, the world\u2019s third largest retailer. Tim Steiner, a founder and chief executive of the UK online grocer, said it was a \u201ctransformative\u201d deal in which the two firms would build 20 automated warehouses across the US over the next three years. Kroger has nearly 2,800 shops across 35 US states and annual sales of $122bn in 2017. It will take a 5% stake in Ocado as part of the deal. At one point, Ocado shares had jumped 81% to \u00a310 and despite slipping back from that level they closed 245.2p better at 797.2, valuing the business at \u00a35.3bn. This means the company is worth more than Marks &amp; Spencer, which is valued at \u00a34.8bn. The value of Steiner\u2019s personal stake in the company surged in value by more than \u00a360m by the time the stock market closed. His shares are worth nearly \u00a3200m. At its current share price, Ocado would surge into the FTSE 100 index of Britain\u2019s biggest companies, which will have its next quarterly reshuffle on 30 May. \u201cOcado\u2019s unique, proprietary and industry-leading technology is set to transform the shopping experience of consumers around the world,\u201d Steiner said. \u201cAs we work through the terms of the services agreement with Kroger in the coming months, we will be preparing the business for a transformative relationship which will reshape the food retailing industry in the US in the years to come.\u201d Rodney McMullen, the chairman and chief executive of Kroger, said the partnership would allow it to \u201cspeed up our efforts to redefine the food and grocery customer experience\u201d. Ocado is providing its technology to Kroger in the US on an exclusive basis and the deal is the latest foray into international markets for the UK group. It has struck partnerships with Groupe Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada and ICA Group in Sweden. Ocado also works in partnership with Morrisons in the UK. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that as one of the most shorted stocks in the UK \u2013 where investors bet that a firm\u2019s share price will fall \u2013 Ocado\u2019s deal with Kroger was a \u201cpoke in the eye\u201d for the hedge funds who have bet against it. \u201cOcado is making great strides in the global grocery market and inflicting serious financial pain on those who have bet against it,\u201d Khalaf said. \u201cThe company is known in the UK as an online supermarket but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg as Ocado is primarily a technology and logistics firm with the potential to license out its services to grocers around the world. \u201cThe short sellers were hoping Ocado wouldn\u2019t deliver on its international expansion plans. That position now looks like a badly busted flush.\u201d Ocado was founded in 2000 by three former Goldman Sachs bankers, including Steiner, but did not report a profit until 2015. The other two founders were Jonathan Faiman, who left the company in 2010, and Jason Gissing, who left in 2014 to work on environmental and social causes. John Lewis was one of the original backers of Ocado, investing \u00a368m and taking a 29% stake. However, the relationship between the two businesses became increasingly fractious. Waitrose \u2013 part of the John Lewis Partnership \u2013 still sells products through Ocado\u2019s online service but the supermarket chain also operates its own delivery service for orders placed on Waitrose.com. Ocado floated on the stock market in 2010 at 180p a share. The directors had been hoping to sell shares at between 200p and 275p but were forced to slash the asking price for shares as they struggled to find investors. Lee Wild, the head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, said Ocado was a \u201cmarmite stock\u201d for years. \u201cOnly last November when it struck a long-awaited international deal in France did attitudes change. This [Kroger] is the big one for Ocado.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As the FTSE 100 hit a record closing high amid the oil price rise, other European markets were also in positive territory. On the UK, Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: A stronger dollar, a rising oil price and the postponement of an interest rate rise can all claim some credit for the recent strong showing from the stock market. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 53.77 points or 0.7% at 7787.97 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.91% to 13,114.61 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.98% to 5621.92 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.29% to 23,801.99 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.04% at 10,216.4 But on Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 16 points or 0.07%. And Brent crude continues to hold onto much of its gains, thanks to the threat of reduced supplies from Iran after the US withdrew from the nuclear deal. It is up 1.27% at $80.29 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The rise in the oil price has helped push the FTSE 100 to a new closing high. The UK\u2019s leading index has been in fairly positive mood recently, along with other markets, after hopes that the US and China could resolve their trade differences. The continuing strength of the dollar against the pound has also been supporting the market, given the FTSE 100 is packed full of overseas earners which benefit when sterling is weaker. Brent\u2019s surge to $80 has given the index its final push to a new record close of 7787.97, up 0.7%. However it is still just below the intra-day record of 7792.56 set on 12 January this year. Meanwhile the FTSE 250 did hit a new peak, helped by the extraordinary jump in Ocado shares. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, also thinks Brent could hit $100 a barrel: Fundamentally the price looks well supported here, OPEC are showing they are in no rush to end production cuts, Venezuela\u2019s oil industry is collapsing under its economic and political crisis and US sanctions aimed at Iran\u2019s oil industry are kicking in. Whilst US production is a constraint on the price, right now this is overshadowed by the Iran Venezuela shortfall. Could oil go higher? Venezuela\u2019s problems are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon and could be exasperated if the Trump aims sanctions at the troubled country following rigged and unfair elections; also if the US can get China to loosen energy ties with Iran, then regardless of increased US shale production, the price could close in on $100. Brent crude is currently up 0.86% at $79.96 a barrel, having earlier risen as high as $80.18. And the FTSE 100\u2019s energy companies are benefiting from the rise and helping to lift the leading index close to its record high. It is up 0.4% at 7767, around 25 points below its peak. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: It took a while, but the FTSE finally become receptive to Brent Crude\u2019s latest rise, lifting the UK index that bit closer to a fresh all-time high.....Though not much has changed with Brent Crude \u2013 it is still dancing about the $80 per barrel mark \u2013 comments from Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne that the black stuff could hit $100 in the coming months if oil companies aren\u2019t given waivers by the US to work in Iran helped boost BP and Shell, in turn lifting the FTSE higher. My colleague Adam Vaughan has been looking at the reasons behind the surge in oil prices: Another voice adding to those suggesting oil has much further to climb. Following news that Total will quit Iran unless it gets a waiver from the US, the boss of the French energy giant has predicted crude at $100 a barrel: Worries about the trade talks between the US and China, along with President Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, continue to unsettle US equity investors. Add to that US bond yields hitting a new seven year high and a disappointing update from Cisco, and Wall Street has opened in negative territory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 26 points or 0.1% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slipped by similar amounts at the open. Back with Iran and the US sanctions which have driven up the oil price to above $80 a barrel, and Europe is prepared to defend its businesses from the fallout. Reuters reports: The European Union will stick to the Iran deal and the bloc\u2019s leaders have mandated their Brussels-based executive to defend the interests of European companies dealing with Tehran from U.S. sanctions if needed, a top EU official said. \u201cOn the Iran nuclear deal, we agreed unanimously that the EU will stay in the agreement as long as Iran remains fully committed to it. Additionally the Commission was given a green light to be ready to act whenever European interests are affected,\u201d the chairman of a two-day EU leaders\u2019 summit in the Bulgarian capital, Donald Tusk, told a news conference. The head of the bloc\u2019s executive European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, told the same conference that the EU was ready to start trade liberalisation talks with the United States in some areas if Washington gives permanent exemptions from aluminum and steel tariffs. Over in the US, weekly jobless claims have risen by more than expected. The number of Americans claiming unemployment benefit increased to 222,000 from 211,000 the previous week, higher than the forecast 215,000. But the four week average fell to 213,250 from 216,000, according to the Labor Department, the lowest level for this average since December 13, 1969 when it was 210,750. Elsewhere in the markets, shares in online supermarket retailer Ocado have shot through the roof after it finally landed a major international deal. Ocado has been promising a big overseas tie-up for literally years, and today it delivered thanks to an alliance with US grocer giant Kroger. Kroger will used Ocado\u2019s technology to upgrade its warehouse operations, automation, logistics and delivery route planning in the US. This should strengthen its hand in the battle against Amazon, as grocers look to automate their systems and use robots to speed up processes and cut costs. Ocado\u2019s shares have rocketed by up to 75% today, as traders bet that this deal is as transformation as Kroger claims. That drove its value up from around \u00a33.7bn to \u00a36bn, enough to get into the FTSE 100. It\u2019s a disaster for the hedge funds who have been short-selling Ocado\u2019s shares, betting that it would fail to achieve international expansion. As Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains, Ocado now seems to have real momentum. Bagging a giant US retailer is a major coup for [Ocado CEO] Tim Steiner and as previously noted, we should see many more deals. Shares are priced for these deals to be coming thick and fast. Peter Kiernan of the Economist Intelligence Unit say\u2019s Total\u2019s (likely) withdrawal from Iran shows that Donald Trump\u2019s sanctions could have a serious impact on the Iranian economy. Kiernan explains: The announcement by Total that that it will leave South Pars 11, unless it is granted a waiver from US secondary sanctions, reflects the likelihood that European energy companies with exposure to the American market or financial system will be unwilling to risk US penalties by deciding to participate in Iran\u2019s oil and gas sector. Iran will seek alternative sources of investment, such as Chinese companies, to get the funds it requires to develop its energy sector instead, but Iran\u2019s likely inability to attract major European companies going forward will be a setback. The Total announcement also gives notice to the difficulties that European policymakers could face in the longer term as they try to keep Iran itself in the nuclear agreement. If investment in Iran does dry up and Iran\u2019s oil exports are significantly cut, both due to US pressures, it will make Europe\u2019s role in keeping the nuclear deal alive more problematic. China is poised to step in if France\u2019s Total does indeed pull out of the Iranian South Pars 11 gas field project (as seems likely). Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, has revealed that state-owned Chinese oil firm CNPC is waiting in the wings, if needed. Zanganeh said: \u201cTotal has said that if it doesn\u2019t get an exemption from the United States to continue its work, it will begin to pull out of the deal. If that happens, the Chinese firm CNPC will replace Total.\u201d Given its strong rally over the last year, analysts are wondering how much higher oil could go. Morgan Stanley have predicted that Brent will trade at $90 per barrel in 2020, thanks to increased demand for diesel (due to new anti-pollution rules on shipping) and jet fuel. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is even more bullish. It estimates that oil could hit $100 per barrel next year, due to supply constrains from Iran (due to sanctions) and Venezuela (where political instability could hit supplies). Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at BAML, says: \u201cLooking into the next 18 months, we expect global oil supply and demand balances to tighten.\u201d US crude oil has also hit its highest level since 2014. It\u2019s up nearly 1% at over $72 per barrel, mirroring today\u2019s rise in Brent crude (which is sourced from the North Sea) Rising oil prices are a boost to the world\u2019s crude producers, but a blow to those countries who are net importers of energy. For them, $80 per barrel oil means higher inflation, and could be bad for growth if consumers have less disposable income to spend once they\u2019ve covered their fuel and energy costs. Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Newsflash: Brent crude has hit $80 per barrel for the first time since November 2014. The news that Total is planning to withdaw from its large Iran gas field deal has pushed prices steadily higher this morning. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has now gained more than 16% since early April, as traders anticipate supply shortages if geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to rise. Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer, says: \u201cSupply concerns are top of mind after the U.S. left the Iran nuclear deal. The geopolitical noise and escalation fears are here to stay.\u201d Now this is interesting.... Iranian state TV is reporting that a British consortium called Pergas has signed a deal to develop an oil field in the south of Iran. Associated Press have the details: The agreement is the first between Iran and a key Western ally of the United States since Washington last week announced it will pull out of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers. Managing Director of Pergas International Consortium Colin Rowley, and Bijan Alipour, managing director of National Iranian South Oil Co., signed a preliminary deed on the partnership in the presence of British Ambassador Rob Macaire in Tehran on Wednesday night. The project, if the agreement turns into a contract, will require more than $1 billion to produce 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day during the next decade in the 55-year old Karanj oil filed. But what about the prospect of US sanctions? Well....Pergas is clear that its focus is on the \u201cEastern Hemisphere\u201d, with projects in the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa. It must feel safe from Washington\u2019s threat to ban foreign firms from accessing the entire US banking and financial system if they deal with Iran. Total isn\u2019t alone! Moller-Maersk, the world\u2019s largest shipping firm is also planning to pull out of Iran. Moller-Maersk\u2019s CEO, Soren Skou, says it will withdraw because of the threat of sanctions from America on any company which maintains links with the Iranians. Skou told Reuters: \u201cWith the sanctions the Americans are to impose, you can\u2019t do business in Iran if you also have business in the U.S., and we have that on a large scale. \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact timing details, but I am certain that we\u2019re also going to shut down (in Iran)\u201d. Skou was speaking after Moller-Maersk reported an \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d underlying loss of $239m in the last three months. It blamed the rising \u201cgeopolitical risks\u201d and the threat of a trade war for driving down shipping rates. French president Emmanuel Macron has weighed in, calling on the European Union to protect companies who want to keep trading with Iran. Speaking at an EU summit in Sofia, Bulgaria, Macron said that France backed a proposal for the EC to protect and compensate European companies hit by US sanctions. Called \u2018blocking sanctions\u2019, they could provide a way for Europe to keep the Iran deal alive. Asked about Total\u2019s threat to quit Iran, Macron told reporters that multinational companies must make their own decisions - but smaller companies needed protection to keep operating in Iran if they want to. \u201cInternational companies with interests in many countries make their own choices according to their own interests. They should continue to have this freedom.\u201d But what is important is that companies and especially medium-sized companies which are perhaps less exposed to other markets, American or others, can make this choice freely.\u201d Brent is creeping higher, and has touched $76.62 per barrel. Oil\u2019s push to a new three and a half-year high threatens to keep inflation up, hitting households and eroding real wages: Oil is also getting a lift from new data showing that US inventories fell by 1.4 million barrels last week. That suggests stronger demand for crude stocks - which should push prices higher. Total\u2019s threat to quit its Iran gas project is significant because it shows that the whole Iranian nuclear deal could unravel. As well as withdrawing from the agreement this month, president Trump declared that companies worldwide must stop doing business with Iran or risk US fines or other punishment. If Total pulls out, other companies will be more reluctant to invest in Iran - a blow to President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s hopes of attracting new investment. Rouhani travelled to Davos in 2014 in an attempt to encourage international firms to invest in Iran; he had hope to attract $200bn of energy infrastructure investments by 2021. Sanam Vakil, associate fellow at Chatham House, said Total\u2019s announcement was \u201ca bad sign, adding: The EU can\u2019t compel or really protect the private sector. Bjarne Schieldrop, an oil analyst at SEB, told the Financial Times that it undermines Europe\u2019s efforts to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive: \u201cTotal\u2019s action . . . backs up the idea that no one sees an easy solution here and that there is little expectation of US leniency,\u201d \u201cWhatever the politicians in Europe are saying, the private companies are just pulling out and folding the cards.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The oil price is heading towards $80 per barrel for the first time since 2014, as Donald Trump\u2019s decision to impose sanctions on Iran continues to reverberate through the financial markets. French energy giant Total announced it would withdraw from a Iranian gas deal before the end of the year, unless it gets a waiver. In a statement last night, Total explained: Total will not continue the SP11 (South Pars 11) project and will have to unwind all related operations before 4 November 2018, unless Total is granted a specific project waiver by US authorities with the support of the French and European authorities. This looks like a blow to Europe\u2019s hopes of keeping its current economic ties with Iran intact, following America\u2019s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal earlier this month. The SP11 agreement was signed last July, making Total the first major Western energy company to invest in the Islamic Republic since sanctions were lifted in 2016. Now, though, Total is worried that it would be sanctioned by the US authorities if it kept dealing with Iran. The potential penalties from Washington simply look unpalatable. The news sent Brent crude jumping to $79.47, a three and a half-year high. This puts $80 in traders\u2019 sights - and leaving motorists facing higher prices at the pumps. Mihir Kapadia, CEO and founder of Sun Global Investments, agrees that geopolitical tensions are driving energy prices higher, with unrest is building in Venezuela ahead of this weekend\u2019s presidential elections. Kapadia explains: Venezuela\u2019s situation grows increasingly worrying and the expected drop in production from Iran means that prices are expected to reach four-year highs once again. There are still concerns as to how increasing oil prices will affect the U.S. and global economy, and with tensions in the Middle East also growing, the next few months is likely to see the market become highly volatile.\u201d Also coming up today: Britain\u2019s bookmakers are reeling from the news that the maximum stake on their fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) must be cut from \u00a3100 to \u00a32, in an attempt to tackle the social damage caused by gambling. It\u2019s also a busy morning in the City, with estate agent Foxtons warning that the London property market remains \u201cvery challenging\u201d, Ocado landing a partnership with US retailer Kroger, and Mothercare announcing the return of once-sacked CEO Mark Newton-Jones. Holiday operator Thomas Cook and Royal Mail are also updating the market. The agenda: 1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures 5pm BST: Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane speaks in London",

      "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee rightly calls attention to both the scandal of corporate executive rewards and the political difficulties in getting them curbed (People want fat cats stopped. Labour must prove it\u2019s up to the job, 16 May). But there is a fairly simple and politically minimalist way to increase executive accountability. As described in my book Corporate Power and Responsible Capitalism?, the Swedish system of nominations committees, which select executives and non-executive directors, has significantly reduced the powers of executives. Adapted to UK circumstances, these committees could widen executive accountability by including small shareholders and \u201csocial\u201d stakeholders, such as NGOs and trade unions having small shareholdings, alongside bigger long-term investors. Variants of the model have been backed by the business thinktank Tomorrow\u2019s Company and small investors\u2019 association ShareSoc. The necessary small amendments to the existing Companies Act would be economical with scarce political capital but would make large corporations more accountable to civil society. Bryn Jones University of Bath \u2022 Polly Toynbee explains the colossal challenge combating \u201cpreconceptions about Labour\u2019s incompetence at running the economy\u201d. This despite necessary rebellions at shareholder AGMs against CEO greed, thwarted by institutional investor apathy at best and wilful corporate collusion at worst. Astonishingly, it is this CEO excess which impoverishes their own investors. Further, your leader (16 May) rightly highlights the Labour-led parliamentary call for referral of the audit sector to the Competition and Markets Authority. We have been here before, notably with the conflict of interest by the accountancy firm Arthur Andersen in its audit of Enron over 15 years ago. A 1990s-style corporate prawn cocktail offensive is now less effective than connecting with and empowering ordinary voters. So, John McDonnell, bypass the fat cats \u2013 Labour must get the message out that it is the people who as workers and investors have the power to change corporate culture and elect a government in their interests. As Bill Clinton famously declared, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d. Let\u2019s empower the people to know this and choose their destiny. Nick Mayer Southampton \u2022 The parliamentary select committee report pulls no punches in blaming the greed of the Carillion executives, who gouged out millions from the business up to the moment of collapse, with \u00a31.5bn owed to creditors and \u00a30.5bn to the pension fund (Carillion fall blamed on hubris and greed, 16 May). The wider issue, for all financial institutions, is the greed of the \u201cbig four\u201d auditors, paid \u00a372m, who colluded with the directors, gave no warnings and signed clean certificates. Surely the executives and auditors should pay all the creditors in full. At what point does the \u201ccosy relationship\u201d become a criminal fraudulent conspiracy? As Polly Toynbee argues, the people want their money back from the fat cats, not slippery apologies. Are the supine regulators part of the conspiracy or will they bring charges? Noel Hodson Tax Reconciliations, Oxford \u2022 We in the west criticise Putin\u2019s Russia as a \u201ckleptocracy\u201d, but the damning report into the collapse of Carillion shows that something similar exists in too many of the boardrooms of British companies. Time and again we read reports of chief executives and their boardroom cronies, to quote Frank Field, \u201cstuffing their mouths with gold\u201d, while their companies go to rack and ruin with thousands thrown out of work and pension schemes impoverished. There is a word for people who appropriate other people\u2019s money: \u201cthief\u201d. If boardroom larcenists can steer clear of the law and go unpunished, it is surely time that the law was changed. Ron Mitchell Coventry \u2022 A simple solution is to ban the auditors of all public companies from undertaking any consultancy or other non-audit work. We need specialist audit firms and totally separate consultancy organisations so that audit opinions are not influenced by potential consultancy fees. Jim Michie Chester \u2022 Thanks to Owen Jones for naming and shaming neoliberalism (Carillion is no one-off scandal. There are many more to come, 17 May). He is right that it is a word we avoid using and so often does elicit the negative response he describes. But we need to use it because it is one of the few words that adequately describes the self-seeking choice that shapes so many of our decisions, whether personal, social, national or global. Neoliberal choice and decision-making is unregulated by any concern for the needs of the other, whether that be a community, a nation, or an underprivileged and marginalised group. Owen is so right, things like Carillon will keep happening, as will so many global and national failures and conflicts, until we understand neoliberalism and its dangers. Canon Paul Townsend Ringwood, Hampshire \u2022 The government\u2019s culpability and responsibility for the collapse of Carillion and its consequences is broader and deeper than your article and the select committee\u2019s report suggest: the government\u2019s insistence that its estate be constructed and managed through prime contract procurement strategies increases the risk of prime contractor default and its disastrous consequences, as well as increasing the cost of everything it purchases. There was a time when local builders or suppliers would deal direct with their local government client: now we must go through a pyramid of consultancies, all adding 20% and \u201cretaining\u201d 10%. Michael Heaton Warminster, Wiltshire \u2022 If a benefits claimant makes a fraudulent claim they may end up in court for their abuse of public funds. When I read about the way in which public money has been handled by Carillion, I find myself wondering when we can expect the court appearances of the directors and their accountants.

Labour must prove it\u2019s up to the job</a>, 16 May). But there is a fairly simple and politically minimalist way to increase executive accountability. As described in my book <a href=\"https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/corporate-power-and-responsible-capitalism\" title=\"\">Corporate Power and Responsible Capitalism?</a>, the Swedish system of nominations committees, which select executives and non-executive directors, has significantly reduced the powers of executives. Adapted to UK circumstances, these committees could widen executive accountability by including small shareholders and \u201csocial\u201d stakeholders, such as NGOs and trade unions having small shareholdings, alongside bigger long-term investors. Variants of the model have been backed by the business thinktank Tomorrow\u2019s Company and small investors\u2019 association ShareSoc. The necessary small amendments to the existing Companies Act would be economical with scarce political capital but would make large corporations more accountable to civil society.<br><strong>Bryn Jones</strong><br><em>University of Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022 Polly Toynbee explains the colossal challenge combating \u201cpreconceptions about Labour\u2019s incompetence at running the economy\u201d. This despite necessary rebellions at shareholder AGMs against CEO greed, thwarted by institutional investor apathy at best and wilful corporate collusion at worst. Astonishingly, it is this CEO excess which impoverishes their own investors. Further, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/15/the-guardian-view-on-carillions-collapse-a-question-of-when-not-if\" title=\"\">your leader</a> (16 May) rightly highlights the Labour-led parliamentary call for referral of the audit sector to the Competition and Markets Authority. We have been here before, notably with the conflict of interest by the accountancy firm Arthur Andersen in its audit of Enron over 15 years ago.</p> <p>A 1990s-style corporate prawn cocktail offensive is now less effective than connecting with and empowering ordinary voters. So, John McDonnell, bypass the fat cats \u2013 Labour must get the message out that it is the people who as workers and investors have the power to change corporate culture and elect a government in their interests. As Bill Clinton famously declared, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d. Let\u2019s empower the people to know this and choose their destiny.<br><strong>Nick Mayer</strong><br><em>Southampton</em></p> <p>\u2022 The parliamentary select committee report pulls no punches in blaming the greed of the Carillion executives, who gouged out millions from the business up to the moment of collapse, with \u00a31.5bn owed to creditors and \u00a30.5bn to the pension fund (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/recklessness-hubris-and-greed-carillion-slammed-by-mps\" title=\"\">Carillion fall blamed on hubris and greed</a>, 16 May). The wider issue, for all financial institutions, is the greed of the \u201cbig four\u201d auditors, paid \u00a372m, who colluded with the directors, gave no warnings and signed clean certificates. Surely the executives and auditors should pay all the creditors in full. At what point does the \u201ccosy relationship\u201d become a criminal fraudulent conspiracy? As Polly Toynbee argues, the people want their money back from the fat cats, not slippery apologies. Are the supine regulators part of the conspiracy or will they bring charges?<br><strong>Noel Hodson</strong><br><em>Tax Reconciliations, Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 We in the west criticise Putin\u2019s Russia as a \u201ckleptocracy\u201d, but the damning report into the collapse of Carillion shows that something similar exists in too many of the boardrooms of British companies. Time and again we read reports of chief executives and their boardroom cronies, to quote Frank Field, \u201cstuffing their mouths with gold\u201d, while their companies go to rack and ruin with thousands thrown out of work and pension schemes impoverished. There is a word for people who appropriate other people\u2019s money: \u201cthief\u201d. If boardroom larcenists can steer clear of the law and go unpunished, it is surely time that the law was changed.<br><strong>Ron Mitchell</strong><br><em>Coventry</em></p> <p>\u2022 A simple solution is to ban the auditors of all public companies from undertaking any consultancy or other non-audit work. We need specialist audit firms and totally separate consultancy organisations so that audit opinions are not influenced by potential consultancy fees.<br><strong>Jim Michie</strong><br><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Thanks to Owen Jones for naming and shaming neoliberalism (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/16/carillion-scandal-neoliberalism-public-services-profit\" title=\"\">Carillion is no one-off scandal. There are many more to come</a>, 17 May). He is right that it is a word we avoid using and so often does elicit the negative response he describes. But we need to use it because it is one of the few words that adequately describes the self-seeking choice that shapes so many of our decisions, whether personal, social, national or global. Neoliberal choice and decision-making is unregulated by any concern for the needs of the other, whether that be a community, a nation, or an underprivileged and marginalised group. Owen is so right, things like Carillon will keep happening, as will so many global and national failures and conflicts, until we understand neoliberalism and its dangers.<br><strong>Canon Paul Townsend</strong><br><em>Ringwood, Hampshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government\u2019s culpability and responsibility for the collapse of Carillion and its consequences is broader and deeper than your article and the select committee\u2019s report suggest: the government\u2019s insistence that its estate be constructed and managed through prime contract procurement strategies increases the risk of prime contractor default and its disastrous consequences, as well as increasing the cost of everything it purchases. There was a time when local builders or suppliers would deal direct with their local government client: now we must go through a pyramid of consultancies, all adding 20% and \u201cretaining\u201d 10%.<br><strong>Michael Heaton</strong><br><em>Warminster, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 If a benefits claimant makes a fraudulent claim they may end up in court for their abuse of public funds. When I read about the way in which public money has been handled by Carillion, I find myself wondering when we can expect the court appearances of the directors and their accountants.<br><strong>Stephen Decker</strong><br><em>Chelmsford, Essex</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>",

The group said Mark Newton-Jones, who was ousted in April, would now be returning to lead the business, potentially within days. His departure came after Mothercare admitted it was in financial difficulties as poor trading put it at risk of breaching the terms of its loans. The group said it was on course to secure \u00a3113.5m in new funds to support the business. It plans to raise \u00a328m from shareholders by issuing new shares in July and has secured new debt facilities of \u00a367.5m from its banks. It is also borrowing \u00a38m from shareholders and \u00a310m from a \u201ctrade partner\u201d. The retailer will launch a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency, under which it will ask landlords and other creditors to let it vacate 50 stores and cut its rent bills on 21 more. Creditors will vote on the CVA, which only relates to certain business entities within Mothercare, on 1 June. The stores are expected to close within a year. At least nine more stores will be closed as Mothercare said it wanted to move to 78 sites by 2020, down from 137. Further jobs could go as the company made clear it was aiming to save up to \u00a315m a year in costs, partly by making changes at its head office and gradually pulling back to only about six international markets compared with the 40 it currently operates in. Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst, described the board\u2019s handling of Mothercare\u2019s difficulties as shambolic. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWho has been leading the decision-making to get rid of Mark Newton-Jones, to support the former chairman and his decision to appoint a successor and then a week later sacking the chairman? This is a publicly listed company and it\u2019s ridiculous. What have the non-executive directors been doing? They all need replacing.\u201d The restructuring was launched as Mothercare reported it had slumped to a \u00a372.8m loss in the year to 24 March, after making a \u00a37.1m profit a year before. Sales at established UK stores fell 1.3% while international sales slid 5.8% but the company said the losses were driven by the costs of 17 store closures last year, onerous leases and the head office restructure before Christmas which resulted in 190 job cuts. The return of Newton-Jones as chief executive will result in David Wood, who was hired as his replacement, switching jobs to managing director. Clive Whiley, the company\u2019s interim executive chairman, said: \u201c\u200eThese measures will allow Mothercare to return to a more stable footing, accelerate the transformation of the group and drive it towards a viable and sustainable future.\u201d The CVA will trigger a review of the Mothercare pension scheme by the Pension Protection Fund. News of the the rescue deal resulted in a boost for Mothercare\u2019s share price, which closed 24% up. But industry watchers warned that Mothercare\u2019s future remained uncertain in a tough market, which has seen the collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin and major store closures by other chains including New Look and Carpetright.",

      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest investment firms is taking on gender inequality by launching the first UK fund to prioritise investing in companies where women are well represented at all levels. Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), which manages \u00a3983bn of assets, said the new fund \u2013 into which the firm has ploughed \u00a350m of its own money \u2013 \u201caims to empower investors to make a difference to the companies in which they invest and wider society\u201d. The scale of the gender pay gap across the British economy has been exposed this year by a government requirement that all companies and public bodies with more than 250 employees must publish their wage disparities. The Guardian\u2019s analysis of the 10,014 employers who submitted data by last month\u2019s deadline revealed that almost eight out of 10 paid men more than women. The data showed women were being paid a median hourly rate that, on average, was 9.7% less than their male colleagues received. The L&amp;G fund\u2019s full name is the L&amp;G Future World Gender in Leadership UK Index Fund, although the company has dubbed it \u201cthe Girl Fund\u201d for short. It will score and rank blue-chip companies according to four gender diversity measures. It will look at the percentage of women on: the board of directors; at executive level; in management; and across the workforce. Companies are expected to reach a minimum of 30% representation of women in these four measures. L&amp;G said it was considering adding another measure to incorporate data relating to the gender pay gap survey. The fund tracks an LGIM-designed index of around 350 of the UK\u2019s largest companies and will allocate more to firms that have achieved higher levels of gender diversity, with the aim of driving up standards in this area. L&amp;G said it would engage with low-scoring companies to discuss how they could improve their gender diversity. Helena Morrissey, the head of personal investing at LGIM and one of the highest-profile women working in the City, said gender inequality \u201cis one of the key issues of our time \u2013 and one that generates so much frustration\u201d. She added: \u201cRather than feeling trapped or despondent, let\u2019s do something about it. I\u2019m excited about the launch of the Girl Fund, which empowers us all to use our money to help companies to progress. When we invest in the success of women, we are investing in the success of business.\u201d The fund is open to small investors with as little as \u00a330 a month to invest. While it might appeal to some of the same people attracted to ethical investment, a number of the companies on the list could raise hackles among responsible investors. As of this week, the index\u2019s top 10 holdings included oil giants Royal Dutch Shell and BP, the largest tobacco company in the world, British American Tobacco, global bank HSBC and the drinks company Diageo.",

      "bodyText": "The price of oil has hit its highest level since November 2014, reaching $80 per barrel, as geopolitical fears cause concerns to rise over potential disruption to supplies. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, have risen by around half in the past year. The new highs have prompted warnings that drivers face soaring petrol and diesel costs. Prices are at levels that will eat into appetite for oil and forecasters have revised downwards their expectations for demand growth this year. Experts said the rises would pose a challenge for central banks already coping with high inflation. \u201cThe biggest test may come in countries that are already seeing target or above-target inflation like the UK,\u201d Craig Erlam, the senior market analyst at Oanda trading group, said. The rising oil price helped the FTSE 100 to a record closing price on Thursday as the London-based index closed at 7787.97, compared with a previous high of 7778.64 in January. Across Europe, shares in oil majors BP, Shell, Total and Eni were all up. Barclays bank has increased its prediction for the year\u2019s average price from $62 to $73 per barrel and some banks are predicting oil could hit $100 next year. Here\u2019s what\u2019s driving up the cost of crude: Donald Trump The US president\u2019s decision to unilaterally exit the nuclear deal with Iran caused markets to price in the impact of Iranian crude exports falling. Iran produces around 4% of global oil supplies, or about 2.4m barrels a day (mb/d). The Middle Eastern producer\u2019s exports fell by around 1.2mb/d when sanctions were last imposed in 2012. This time around will be different as the European Union has said it is determined to keep alive the deal and will not be forcing sanctions on Tehran. The International Energy Agency, the Paris-based energy watchdog, said: \u201cIt is too soon to say what will happen this time but we should examine whether other producers could step in to ensure an orderly flow of oil to the market and offset a disruption to Iranian exports.\u201d Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, has already said it will work to fill any gap left by Iran. Saudi Arabia and Russia Nearly 17 months of cuts by major oil-producing countries, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, have made their mark. The curbs by the oil cartel Opec and partners have brought global oil supply and demand back into balance, to a degree that the IEA recently said it was \u201cmission accomplished\u201d. Together, Opec and Russia produce more than 40% of the world\u2019s oil. Despite prices rising steadily under the restrictions, oil states have proved remarkably compliant and have not increased production as they have done during previous attempts to influence the market. The Saudi and Russian energy ministers have forged a partnership that they say has them \u201cunited shoulder to shoulder\u201d and \u201ccompletely aligned\u201d. Opec members are expected to meet in Vienna to discuss whether the cuts should continue beyond the end of 2018, when they are due to expire. However, that decision has been complicated by: Venezuela The political and economic crises affecting the oil-rich South American country have resulted in its crude production going into freefall. The collapse has tightened oil markets much more quickly than anticipated, experts said. Output is down so much that Venezuela has cut production even more than Saudi Arabia, Opec\u2019s biggest producer. The IEA paints a dire picture of an oil industry falling apart as conditions in the country worsen, with corruption issues, problems with payments and equipment breaking down. \u201cOutput from Venezuela\u2019s ageing conventional oilfields is also fast declining. To make matters worse, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela [the state-owned oil and gas company] has seen droves of its employees leave their jobs due to low wages and safety and security concerns,\u201d the agency said. Geopolitics Iran and Venezuela are not the only sources of geopolitical instability causing oil prices to rise. \u201cThe ongoing escalation of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, continuing conflicts in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen have significantly taken their toll on the region,\u201d Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said. While a direct military confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia is seen as unlikely, any intensification of proxy conflicts in the region would undermine stability, the Japanese financial services group said. The IEA warned that recent geopolitical events had increased uncertainty over future global oil supplies. The global economy Globally, the economy is strong, with the IMF forecasting 3.9% growth this year. Healthy economic activity had been been an important factor in rising oil prices so far but observers are warning that crude is so expensive it will begin to dent demand for oil. \u201cIt would be extraordinary if such a large jump [since last year] did not affect demand growth,\u201d the IEA said. The watchdog this week revised down global oil demand growth slightly from 1.5mb/d to 1.4mb/d, to reflect the impact of higher oil prices. Demand is expected to average 99.2mb/d this year. Another counterbalance to bullish prices is US shale oil production, which has boomed off the back of stronger oil prices. US production is at at record highs, up more than a quarter on levels only two years ago, and more than half where it stood a decade ago. However, Goldman Sachs said: \u201cShale cannot solve the current oil supply problems.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Nationalisation of east coast mainline was the only viable option  | Nils Pratley", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The decision was \u201cvery finely balanced\u201d, said transport secretary Chris Grayling, meaning both options on the east coast mainline were terrible from this point of view. He chose the right one. Keeping Stagecoach, under the Virgin Trains banner, on the job would have looked appalling. The operator got its numbers spectacularly wrong when it agreed to pay \u00a33.3bn for an eight-year deal to run the London-to-Edinburgh railway route. It couldn\u2019t even limp into the third year of the deal. To be awarded a \u201cnot for profit\u201d follow-on arrangement until 2020 \u2013 but one that, critically, could have included a performance-related payment at the end \u2013 would have been an unacceptable reward for failing to honour financial commitments. Nationalisation is problematic since Grayling has had to scramble around for expertise to run his \u201cOperator of Last Resort\u201d. No wonder he spent more time trumpeting his revival of the \u201ciconic\u201d London and North Eastern Railway name. But a period of public ownership was the only pragmatic solution. The interesting question, though, is what comes next. Nationalisation is intended to be temporary since, come 2020, Grayling will unleash his shiny new public-private partnership on the east coast. Indeed, he suggested the chance to \u201cshape the new partnership\u201d by taking immediate control was a critical factor in his decision. How, though, is this partnership intended to work? It has been six months since Grayling unveiled his \u201cstrategic vision for rail\u201d and it remains a mystery to outsiders how publicly owned Network Rail, which owns the track, and the private train operators are meant to work as \u201cone single team operating the railway\u201d. In loose outline, the ambition seems fine. Everybody can see that it would better and cheaper if both parties spent less time squabbling over who is responsible for delays. But what\u2019s the financial set-up? The train operators, as Stagecoach has just demonstrated, don\u2019t have the balance sheets to shoulder the financial risks that come with big infrastructure upgrades. If ownership of the infrastructure will remain in the public sector \u201cin all circumstances\u201d, as Grayling told the Commons, how is the new model genuinely different from the current franchising system? All we really know about Grayling\u2019s big idea is that a route will have a single board with an independent chair and representatives from Network Rail and the train operating company. But life has already become more complicated because some routes have two or three operators \u2013 thus \u201cindependent members\u201d will have to represent their interests. Are these competing financial interests really going to be resolved just by sitting in the same boardroom? Nationalisation of the East Coast may turn out of the easy bit. CBI\u2019s response to Carillion report misses the point The CBI is obliged to wave the flag for its members in all weathers but it takes a peculiar mind-set to read the two select committees\u2019 report on the failure of Carillion and conclude that the MPs were somehow attacking UK business in its entirety. That, though, seems to be the CBI\u2019s interpretation. \u201cThe language of the report suggests committee members think business in general is greedy and reckless,\u201d says Josh Hardie, deputy director general. \u201cThis is irresponsible and wholly inaccurate.\u201d Hardie should turn to the 52 conclusions and recommendations at the end of the report where he will find the MPs saying the exact opposite of what he thinks they said.

      "body": "<p>The decision was \u201cvery finely balanced\u201d, said transport secretary Chris Grayling, meaning both options on the east coast mainline were terrible from this point of view. He chose the right one.</p> \n<p>Keeping Stagecoach, under the Virgin Trains banner, on the job would have looked appalling. The operator got its numbers spectacularly wrong when it agreed to pay \u00a33.3bn for an eight-year deal to run the London-to-Edinburgh railway route. It couldn\u2019t even limp into the third year of the deal. To be awarded a \u201cnot for profit\u201d follow-on arrangement until 2020 \u2013 but one that, critically, could have included a performance-related payment at the end \u2013 would have been an unacceptable reward for failing to honour financial commitments.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/16/east-coast-rail-line-to-be-temporarily-renationalised-virgin-stagecoach\">Nationalisation</a> is problematic since Grayling has had to scramble around for expertise to run his \u201cOperator of Last Resort\u201d. No wonder he spent more time trumpeting his revival of the \u201ciconic\u201d London and North Eastern Railway name. But a period of public ownership was the only pragmatic solution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d85e228f-7f05-41d4-9cff-8c74a754ca27\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Transport secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s decision was surprising given his vehement opposition to public control of rail. But he said the move was partly to expedite the planned east coast partnership, which would see a contract re-let to a private firm in 2020. However, several train companies \u2013 such as South Western, TransPennine Express and Greater Anglia \u2013 face similar struggles to Stagecoach and Virgin after overbidding for franchises and events may yet force his hand again.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Will East Coast rail services remain nationalised?&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>It\u2019s not the plan, but it\u2019s possible. The pressure to avoid any further franchise collapse \u2013 or to see Stagecoach-Virgin emerge as operators again, with a diminishing market of bidders \u2013 could see the government struggle to get a new operator in place.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>So who will now run the trains?</b></p>\n    <p>Control will pass in June to the \u201coperator of last resort\u201d \u2013 an Arup-led group contracted on the government\u2019s behalf. The train service will be rebranded London North Eastern Railway.</p>\n    <p><b>What will the impact be for passengers?</b></p>\n    <p>In the short term, little or none. New British-assembled Hitachi trains are already on order, paid for by the government.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>How much will it cost the public?</b></p>\n    <p>The Department for Transport assessment was that either immediate option, a fresh Virgin Trains contract or direct control, was broadly similar in cost. Analysis by rail regulators in 2013 found East Coast required less subsidy than any other line when in public hands, while it delivered more than \u00a31bn to the Treasury. Stagecoach promised vastly more, \u00a33.3bn by 2023, but found it impossible to pay up.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The interesting question, though, is what comes next. Nationalisation is intended to be temporary since, come 2020, Grayling will unleash his shiny new public-private partnership on the east coast. Indeed, he suggested the chance to \u201cshape the new partnership\u201d by taking immediate control was a critical factor in his decision.</p> \n<p>How, though, is this partnership intended to work? It has been six months since Grayling unveiled his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/29/east-coast-rail-franchise-terminated-three-years-early-virgin-trains\">\u201cstrategic vision for rail\u201d</a> and it remains a mystery to outsiders how publicly owned Network Rail, which owns the track, and the private train operators are meant to work as \u201cone single team operating the railway\u201d.</p> \n<p>In loose outline, the ambition seems fine. Everybody can see that it would better and cheaper if both parties spent less time squabbling over who is responsible for delays. But what\u2019s the financial set-up? The train operators, as Stagecoach has just demonstrated, don\u2019t have the balance sheets to shoulder the financial risks that come with big infrastructure upgrades. If ownership of the infrastructure will remain in the public sector \u201cin all circumstances\u201d, as Grayling told the Commons, how is the new model genuinely different from the current franchising system?</p> \n<p>All we really know about Grayling\u2019s big idea is that a route will have a single board with an independent chair and representatives from Network Rail and the train operating company. But life has already become more complicated because some routes have two or three operators \u2013 thus \u201cindependent members\u201d will have to represent their interests. Are these competing financial interests really going to be resolved just by sitting in the same boardroom? Nationalisation of the East Coast may turn out of the easy bit. </p> \n<h2>CBI\u2019s response to Carillion report misses the point </h2> \n<p>The CBI is obliged to wave the flag for its members in all weathers but it takes a peculiar mind-set to read the two select committees\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/recklessness-hubris-and-greed-carillion-slammed-by-mps\">report on the failure of Carillion</a> and conclude that the MPs were somehow attacking UK business in its entirety.</p> \n<p>That, though, seems to be the CBI\u2019s interpretation. \u201cThe language of the report suggests committee members think business in general is greedy and reckless,\u201d says Josh Hardie, deputy director general. \u201cThis is irresponsible and wholly inaccurate.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hardie should turn to the 52 conclusions and recommendations at the end of the report where he will find the MPs saying the exact opposite of what he thinks they said. The final conclusion (page 96 for his ease of reference) includes this clear sentence: \u201cMost companies are not run with Carillion\u2019s reckless short-termism, and most companies are far more concerned by the wider consequences of their actions than the Carillion board.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ae4c6f9c-382a-496d-93d7-83d311ebb9c8\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What was Carillion?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Wolverhampton-based firm was second only to Balfour Beatty in size.<br></p>\n    <p>It was spun out of the Tarmac construction business in 1999 and steadily took over rivals, such as Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine.

      "bodyText": "Paddy Power Betfair has made the first move in an expected wave of takeover activity prompted by the legalisation of sports betting in the US, as it launched a bid for fantasy sports league company FanDuel. Shares in UK gambling companies soared earlier this week as investors responded to the US supreme court\u2019s decision to overturn a law known as PASPA, a ban on sports bets that had stood for 26 years. Many analysts believe London-listed firms are well placed to grab a slice of the US market, where some estimates say nearly $150bn (\u00a3111bn) in illegal wagers are placed every year. While US states will have to draw up their own gambling laws, a process that could take years in some cases, the shift in the US landscape is expected to encourage British firms to seek takeovers or become targets themselves. Paddy Power confirmed it was already in talks with FanDuel \u201cto create a combined business to target the prospective US sports betting market\u201d. FanDuel is a web-based fantasy sports game with 6 million registered users, who can put together virtual teams in sports such as American football and win cash prizes based on their success against other players. Such websites have slipped through the net of the US ban on sports betting because they are seen as games of skill rather than of chance but an alliance would help Paddy Power push betting products through the site. If a deal goes ahead, it is likely to be worth considerably more than the $48m (\u00a335.6m) that Paddy Power paid for FanDuel\u2019s smaller rival Draft last year. FanDuel, which was blocked from merging with its main competitor DraftKings by the US competition regulators last year, has been valued at $1bn by some analysts. Paddy Power Betfair\u2019s shares jumped by more than 12.2% in a day when the supreme court announced its decision earlier this week, signalling analysts\u2019 belief that it is well placed to launch an assault on the US market. They closed up a further 6% on Wednesday at \u00a382.15 as markets digested the potential for the company to add FanDuel to its existing US operation. As well as its fantasy sports presence via Draft, Paddy Power Betfair owns horseracing TV channel TVG and an online casino in New Jersey, the state that challenged the ban on sports betting and has made the most progress putting preparations in place for the industry to grow. However, while Paddy Power hopes to be the buyer in this case, analysts at the stockbroker Goodbody said European betting firms could find that they are tempting targets for US companies looking to purchase expertise. \u201cGiven the regulatory and taxation headwinds that European operators are facing in their home markets over the next few years, [the repeal of PASPA] is a very attractive long-term positive for the companies under our coverage and as such is supportive of their long-term growth prospects,\u201d they said. \u201cIt also could see European operators speculated as potential M&amp;A targets, given the unique sports betting skill set they possess,\u201d said the analyst Gavin Kelleher. Shares in the online casino 888 and the high street bookmaker William Hill jumped by 15% and 11% respectively on the repeal of PASPA. Both have a US presence and have previously explored options for consolidation before ultimately rejecting them. William Hill and Canada\u2019s Amaya called off a \u00a34.6bn merger in 2016, while the British bookmaker turned down a tentative approach for a three-way merger with 888 and the Mecca Bingo owner, Rank.",

      "bodyText": "More than a million jobs have been created in Australia in the past five years, meeting the goal set by the former prime minister Tony Abbott when the Coalition came to power in 2013. Labor is doing its best to douse any celebrations, pointing out the jobless rate is roughly the same as it was four and half years ago, at 5.6%, and wages growth remains close to a 20-year low, at just 2.1%. But Malcolm Turnbull says the occasion is worth celebrating, especially because the government had met its goal months ahead of schedule. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen phenomenal growth in jobs,\u201d he said on Thursday during a visit to the seat of Longman in Queensland, which is facing a byelection soon. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon \u201cWhen the Liberal National government was elected in September 2013, prime minister Tony Abbott promised that we would create a million jobs in five years. It seemed pretty ambitious at that time. \u201cLast year alone, 2017, we had the largest number of jobs created in Australia in our history.\u201d Bureau of Statistics data show more than 1,016,900 jobs have now been created since September 2013, after 22,600 jobs were added in April. The underlying composition of the net change in April was an increase of 32,700 persons in full-time employment and a 10,000 decrease in part-time employment, in seasonally adjusted terms. Over the past 12 months, full-time employment has increased by 265,200 persons, while part-time employment has increased by 66,900 persons. The jobs growth in April followed two consecutive months of job falls in February (-7,400) and March (-700), and was not strong enough to prevent the annual rate of employment growth falling from 3% to 2.7%, its lowest rate since July 2016. But the employment to population ratio remained steady in April, at 61.9%, which is 0.7 percentage points higher than a year ago. The participation rate also increased, from 65.5% to 65.6%, while monthly hours worked in all jobs increased by 19.4 m hours (or 1.1%), to 1,764 m hours, thanks to strong employment in full-time jobs. However, the unemployment rate also increased \u2013 from 5.5% to 5.6% \u2013 to hit a nine-month high. Some economists have questioned if the official rise in unemployment is believable, given other indicators suggest improving demand for labour. \u201cThe big debate is why the unemployment rate is not falling, given usually reliable indicators suggest it should be,\u201d NAB\u2019s chief economist, Ivan Colhoun, said. \u201cYes, participation is increasing, but that isn\u2019t usually enough to stop the unemployment rate from declining. It is something of a mystery \u2013 we suspect the unemployment part of the survey just isn\u2019t quite picking up the broad trend for unemployment at present.\u201d But Labor said the rise in unemployment was a worrying sign. \u201cThere are now 741,000 unemployed Australians, with 46,300 more people lining the unemployment queue than when the Abbott-Turnbull government was first elected,\u201d the shadow minister for employment, Brendan O\u2019Connor, said. \u201cYouth unemployment has increased to 12.6%. The most recent underemployment data shows there are almost 1.1 million underemployed Australians looking for more work but unable to find it. \u201cWhile Turnbull may try to boast about jobs figures, the truth is the facts are more complicated.\u201d On Wednesday, new data showed national wages were struggling to grow above an annual rate of 2%, casting doubt on the forecasts for wages growth in the Turnbull government\u2019s budget. Kate Hickie, from Capital Economics, said Thursday\u2019s jobs data showed there was still excess slack in the labour market, so wage growth was unlikely to rise much above 2.1% for some time. \u201cIn fact, we expect the wage growth will remain below 2.5% throughout this year and next,\u201d she said.
