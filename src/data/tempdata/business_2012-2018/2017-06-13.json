      "bodyText": "It was billed as the first big Brexit battle for the City of London. Would Brussels launch a raid on London\u2019s lucrative business of clearing \u20ac1tn (\u00a3880bn) a day of euro-denominated trades, which is what former French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande wanted when he said \u201cthose who seek the end of Europe\u201d needed to be taught \u201ca lesson\u201d? Or would the European commission take the grown-up view that, actually, forcing all this financial activity to take place within the borders of the EU would do more harm than good, even for the EU itself? The answer \u2013 as with most things Brexit-related \u2013 is messy. The keenly awaited report from the commission booted the important decisions into the long grass of technical assessments. Yet the commission has also retained the nuclear option of enforced relocation for clearing houses, bodies that stand between two parties to a financial trade, when they\u2019re dealing in euro-denominated derivatives. That will alarm London, and especially the Treasury. Not even the US, where protectionist tendencies are rarely far from the surface, insists upon dollar-related derivative trades being cleared in its own back yard. On a cheerful reading for the City, one might say that nothing has been settled immediately. London has avoided an upright Hollande-style land grab. The commission is formally open to the idea that enhanced supervision by the European Securities and Markets Authority could do the job of ensuring the EU can protect itself against market instability. Yet the proposal also clears the way for that same body to insist that clearing houses move their euro business to the EU in some circumstances. The idea almost seems to be framed with London in mind. The proposed two-tier system actually contains three tiers, with the highest category of \u201csubstantially systemically important\u201d seemingly reserved for LCH, the London Stock Exchange\u2019s big clearing house in London. LCH currently clears about three-quarters of interest rate swaps denominated in euros. A judgment that LCH is big and important is not contentious. But the idea that safety would be improved by peeling off parts of the business, and forcing them into the EU, makes no sense. Such a manoeuvre would probably create more risks, not fewer. Smaller pools of capital are less able to absorb shocks when one party to a trade defaults. Regulators have to work harder to police activity. Costs would increase for everybody, including businesses across Europe. The correct way forward here would be for the EU to give itself whatever powers of supervision it wants over euro-denominated clearing. It\u2019s not hard to do, and it\u2019s how the US operates. The entire thrust of international regulation since the financial crisis has been to improve transparency and LCH already dances to the tune of many different regulators. Clearing houses, or central counter parties, are now one the most tightly regulated parts of the financial system. But none of those international regulators has ever insisted on enforced relocation of clearing. Brexit, by rights, should not change that approach. Brussels, one fears, is playing hardball games even before negotiations have even started. Recovering Capita If your share price has fallen as far and as fast as Capita\u2019s, the definition of success is avoiding fresh calamities. Tuesday\u2019s trading update did the trick. The outsourcing firm continues to expect profits to improve in the second half. Its win rate on contracts has returned to one-in-two, as opposed to last year\u2019s one-in-three. And the promised cost savings are arriving. The shares rose 15% to 634p. That\u2019s a long way from the \u00a310.50 of a year ago, before the first of two hefty profits warnings related to overspending on the London congestion charge contract and failure to spot the rot in the now-sold recruitment business. But it should encourage the idea that Capita requires less surgery than sprawling rival Serco did. The risk of a rights issue could soon be zero. Net debt was \u00a31.8bn at the last count but, if the sales of the asset services division fetches the rumoured \u00a3700m, the proceeds would return Capita\u2019s balance sheet to the land of the normal. At the point, the ambition to protect the dividend, currently offering a 5% yield, would be more than credible. The divi costs \u00a3200m a year, and Capita still managed to generate \u00a3400m of cash in its rotten 2016. Chief executive Andy Parker was obliged to fall on his sword in March. It wasn\u2019t unexpected since Capita has had two profits warnings in 25 years and both were on his watch. But, as matters look today, he\u2019s not handing over a basket-case.",

    "webTitle": "Brussels plan could force euro clearing out of UK after Brexit", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brussels has published proposals that could force London\u2019s prized euro-clearing trade out of the City after Brexit, as the EU plans for life without Europe\u2019s biggest financial centre. While the plans stop short of forced relocation after Brexit in 2019, they would give the EU greater oversight and the power to compel \u201csystemically important\u201d firms to move to the continent in the name of protecting financial stability. London is the global centre of euro-clearing, which involves processing transactions worth about \u20ac1tn (\u00a3880bn) a day, making the market a key part of Britain\u2019s financial services industry. Euro clearing is essential to the flow of money around the world: clearing houses act as an intermediary between two sides of a trade conducted in euros, such as derivatives contracts designed to shield businesses from sudden shifts in interest rates or currencies. The head of the London Stock exchange warned last year that 100,000 jobs in the City were at risk if the UK capital lost the ability to process euro-denominated transactions. The latest proposals from the European commission fall short of a full-frontal assault on London\u2019s euro-clearing business, but City bodies decried the lack of detail about how and when Brussels might pull the trigger. According to the draft law, if the European Securities and Markets Authority decides that a clearing house outside the EU is handling \u201csystemically\u201d important volumes of euro-denominated trade, a system of tougher supervision would be introduced. Any \u201csystemically important\u201d business deemed to pose a potential risk to financial stability could be required to move to the continent Technical experts at ESMA would make a relocation recommendation, with input from the European Central Bank, but the commission would take the final decision. \u201cThe purpose of our legislative proposal is to ensure financial stability and not moving business for the sake of moving business,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commission vice-president in charge of financial markets, told reporters. Brexit meant \u201ccertain adjustments to our rules\u201d were needed, he added. EU officials gave officials a degree of discretion in determining whether the EU\u2019s financial stability is threatened by the trade in Brexit London. In theory, this could give the EU more speed and flexibility to adjust their rules against UK-based firms in future, while also not closing down avenues ahead of the Brexit negotiations. The draft law has to be agreed by EU finance ministers and the European parliament, a process that will begin against the backdrop of the Brexit negotiations, which must end with the UK\u2019s EU exit on 30 March 2019. Lobby groups in the City of London said the proposals from Brussels would damage the EU unnecessarily while increasing risk, because clearing could become more fragmented. \u201cThe EU is simply not equipped to handle the volume of clearing that the UK does each day,\u201d said Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, the local government authority for London\u2019s financial district. She said US authorities were not suggesting dollar clearing should be repatriated from London, although the US trade is even larger, at $2.1tn (\u00a31.6tn) a day. Miles Celic, the chief executive of TheCityUK, a lobby group, said: \u201cWhile these proposals appear to fall short of the worst-case scenario, the European commission is holding back any real detail on when or how it might pull the trigger on a location policy.\u201d He accused the commission of \u201ccurrency nationalism [that] is likely lead to less competition, higher costs and market fragmentation\u201d. The British government, which has the right to vote on these proposals while it remains an EU member, is likely to pursue a similar line of attack. The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, is likely to tell his EU counterparts that any attempt to damage London\u2019s euro clearing for national advantage would rebound on European firms with higher costs. A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s central counterparties [clearing houses] play a crucial role in supporting economic growth here and across the EU. We are clear that how UK firms access EU markets, and vice versa, is a matter for the forthcoming exit negotiations. In the meantime we stand ready to engage constructively on this legislation, fulfilling our obligations as a member state.\u201d",

Any \u201csystemically important\u201d business deemed to pose a potential risk to financial stability could be required to move to the continent</p> \n<p> Technical experts at ESMA would make a relocation recommendation, with input from the European Central Bank, but the commission would take the final decision.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe purpose of our legislative proposal is to ensure financial stability and not moving business for the sake of moving business,\u201d Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commission vice-president in charge of financial markets, told reporters.</p> \n<p> Brexit meant \u201ccertain adjustments to our rules\u201d were needed, he added.</p> \n<p>EU officials gave officials a degree of discretion in determining whether the EU\u2019s financial stability is threatened by the trade in Brexit London. In theory, this could give the EU more speed and flexibility to adjust their rules against UK-based firms in future, while also not closing down avenues ahead of the Brexit negotiations.</p> \n<p> The draft law has to be agreed by EU finance ministers and the European parliament, a process that will begin against the backdrop of the Brexit negotiations, which must end with the UK\u2019s EU exit on 30 March 2019.</p> \n<p> Lobby groups in the City of London said the proposals from Brussels would damage the EU unnecessarily while increasing risk, because clearing could become more fragmented.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe EU is simply not equipped to handle the volume of clearing that the UK does each day,\u201d said Catherine McGuinness, policy chairman at the City of London Corporation, the local government authority for London\u2019s financial district. She said US authorities were not suggesting dollar clearing should be repatriated from London, although the US trade is even larger, at $2.1tn (\u00a31.6tn) a day.</p> \n<p>Miles Celic, the chief executive of TheCityUK, a lobby group, said: \u201cWhile these proposals appear to fall short of the worst-case scenario, the European commission is holding back any real detail on when or how it might pull the trigger on a location policy.\u201d</p> \n<p> He accused the commission of \u201ccurrency nationalism [that] is likely lead to less competition, higher costs and market fragmentation\u201d.</p> \n<p> The British government, which has the right to vote on these proposals while it remains an EU member, is likely to pursue a similar line of attack. The chancellor of the exchequer, Philip Hammond, is likely to tell his EU counterparts that any attempt to damage London\u2019s euro clearing for national advantage would rebound on European firms with higher costs.</p> \n<p> A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s central counterparties [clearing houses] play a crucial role in supporting economic growth here and across the EU. We are clear that how UK firms access EU markets, and vice versa, is a matter for the forthcoming exit negotiations. In the meantime we stand ready to engage constructively on this legislation, fulfilling our obligations as a member state.\u201d</p>",

    "webTitle": "Government urged to act on wage squeeze as UK inflation rate hits 2.9% \u2013 as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for today, I think. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the inflation data: Thanks for reading and commenting. GW Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, argues that the government must respond to the pickup in inflation, and reverse some of its austerity measures. He writes: Had Theresa May won the landslide she was clearly expecting, the government would have been able to ride out this difficult period. Inflation is likely to go up a bit further, but the ONS\u2019s separate figures for producer output prices, which measure the cost of goods leaving factory gates and provide a guide to inflationary pressure early in the pipeline, appear to have peaked. Moreover, weaker consumer spending will result in lower growth and this will eventually feed through into a fall in inflation. But May is a weakened prime minister heading a minority administration and she doesn\u2019t have time on her side. The government has recognised that voters are unhappy about falling living standards and have had enough of cuts. Deficit reduction will now play second fiddle to the need to raise real incomes, so expect a generous uplift in the minimum wage and an easing of curbs on public sector pay as signs that the age of austerity is over. More here: Rising prices are bad news for those who have managed to save money, particularly if they\u2019re relying on savings income (as many pensioners are). M&amp;S have calculated that the gap between the interest rate on cash savings and inflation is the widest since November 2011. That means savings, as well as wages, are shrinking in real terms. Ritu Vohora, Investment Director at M&amp;G, has the details: \u201cAt this rate, \u00a35,000 left in an average bank account would lose \u00a3137.50, in real terms after the effects of inflation, over the next 12 months. \u201cAll investments come with some risk, but these rock bottom net savings rates carry the very real risk of eroding wealth.\u201d \u201cNow could be the right time to consider whether investing in stocks and shares could be a better way to protect against inflation, and achieve your long-term financial goals.\u201d The head of the Confederation of British Industry has called Thursday\u2019s general election a political earthquake, but said it\u2019s an opportunity for a different kind of Brexit in which the voice of common sense is heard. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, also warned Theresa May that for businesses across the UK, particularly in Northern Ireland, a soft border in the country was fundamental. \u201cClearly it was just a political earthquake last Thursday. What we saw and realised is a lot of the consensus we thought we had we actually don\u2019t have,\u201d Fairbairn told the Fortune Most Powerful Women International Summit in London on Tuesday. \u201cMy biggest message is this is a time to broaden the church, listen to and work through the biggest issues. \u201cWe know we really care about the strength of our economy, about the regions of the UK growing. Don\u2019t just be focused on London. The young turned out in their thousands, listen to that young voice.\u201d Fairbairn said the soft border in Ireland was \u201cabsolutely fundamental\u201d, because it had helped understanding between people and the peace process. \u201cI\u2019m hoping from a business and practically human point of view that there is a commitment to that,\u201d she said. She added that there was much unhelpful language around Brexit ahead of the commencement of negotiations next week, such as \u201chard and soft\u201d Brexit. \u201cWe know we want access to the single market, jobs depend on it. We also know there is a dilemma we\u2019re facing, there is real public concern around immigration. We\u2019re also seeing companies with skills shortages, a 96% reduction in nurses applying [as revealed yesterday]. We need to open up that dilemma again and come up with ways to address the public concern.\u201d Asked why businesses were quiet during the referendum campaign, Fairbairn said they weren\u2019t but their voice wasn\u2019t heard enough. \u201cWe learnt through the referendum how strong this sense of feeling left out of prosperity and growth a lot of the country felt,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe didn\u2019t understand enough the concerns around immigration.\u201d What was needed now was \u201ca reset\u201d, she explained. \u201cIn terms of the migration issue, I think people were saying we want control back. Is that served by a single number, a cap? If not, let\u2019s go back to problem solving.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got a fundamental confidence in common sense prevailing through all this,\u201d Fairbairn said. \u201cI think nobody in this room would think the referendum campaigns were good. The information and understanding... I think we can get to a better place now, where there are more voices coming through. Universities, young people. The chips are falling a different way now and we can have a different outcome. The fact is the EU will be our trading partner for a long time and it\u2019s an opportunity to protect our relationship.\u201d But she added: \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear, everybody I speak to in business accepts Brexit is happening. But what we don\u2019t have is a consensus about how it\u2019s happening.\u201d She stressed that there was a lot of \u201creally fantastic stuff\u201d going on in businesses across the country, and urged people \u201cnot get too down on ourselves in terms of the economy\u201d, which has huge potential. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to get Brexit right and make sure we have access to the single market.\u201d While Britain faces the prospect of falling real wages, squeezed households and ongoing child poverty, America\u2019s stock market has just hit a new all-time high. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped by around 70 points to 21,307, a new record. Investment bank Goldman Sachs is the biggest riser (+1.5%), followed by credit card firm VISA (1.2%). Tech firms Apple, Microsoft and Cisco have all gained around 1%, after two days of losses. UK government bond prices have hit their lowest levels in a month since the inflation data was released. The pound has also risen, now up 0.7 of a cent at $1.2720. Those two facts suggests that traders see a higher chance that the Bank of England tightens monetary policy sooner, because of the risk of inflation. However, several economists are suggesting that the BoE will be content to \u2018look through\u2019 the inflation figures. The FTSE, meanwhile, is almost flat at 7519 points, up 0.1%. Ashwin Kumar, Chief Economist at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, has joined the ranks of the experts calling for the government to end its benefits freeze. He points out that the policy becomes particularly harsh when prices start to accelerate: \u201cPeople on low incomes face challenging times. Inflation is up by the highest rate in five years, continuing a sharp rise since the Brexit vote, and employment figures out tomorrow are likely to show that wages are barely keeping up. With increases of 2 per cent in food, nearly 5 per cent in energy and 3 percent in clothing and footwear, families are facing very difficult choices. \u201cThe benefit freeze will squeeze family budgets even further. This was a policy designed in an era of very low inflation. This is no longer the case and low-income households are suffering. As the cost of essentials rises, the new Government could help struggling families by ending the freeze on benefits.\u201d Given the current economic uncertainty, Brits should plan for this wage squeeze to last for some time. Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, says. \u201cThe seemingly perpetual squeeze on UK households continues. The rise of inflation to 2.9% means no end is in sight for hard-pressed consumers who see prices rising but growth in their wages failing to keep pace. It is no surprise then that consumers are reining back on spending or in many cases are turning to credit to get by as day-to-day living gets more expensive.\u201d \u201cPrices will continue to rise due to the falling pound and the higher costs of imports so the message has to be try to be prudent with spending and stash more cash. You will need more bang for your buck in the next few months and having more money in your financial armoury can only help.\u201d Britain\u2019s real pay crisis is a sign that austerity has failed, argues the GMB Union. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, says Theresa May must take the opportunity to ditch polities such as the public sector pay freeze: \u201cYet again, we are seeing the cost of living rise faster than wages. Inflation has risen to almost ten times its rate 12 months ago. In the real world, that increase means that no matter how hard people work, increasingly they are struggling to pay their bills. \u201cToo often there is more month than money left after pay day. \u201cThis is further proof, if any was needed, that austerity has failed and that it\u2019s working people paying the price. \u201cIf the Prime Minister is to take anything away from her election embarrassment, it should be that people are fed up. \u201cThey\u2019re fed up with working hard to stand still and with a system set up to benefit those who already have more than enough. \u201cEnding the public sector pay freeze and making sure all workers are paid a decent wage is an absolutely must, and it needs to be on the agenda for the Queen\u2019s Speech.\u201d A neat summary of today\u2019s data: House price inflation has also risen, thanks to a pick-up in prices in London. The average house price rose by 5.6% in the 12 months to April, to \u00a3220,000. That\u2019s up from 4.5% in the year to March 2017. The Office for National Statistics cautions that: While up against March 2017, there has been a general slowdown in the annual growth rate since mid-2016. London continues to be the region with the highest average house price at \u00a3483,000, followed by the South East (\u00a3315k) and the East of England, (\u00a3281k). The North East still has the lowest average price (123k). In London, prices have risen by 4.7% in the last 12 months -- up from just 1.5% a month ago. Today\u2019s Evening Standard is splashing on the rise in inflation, and blaming it on the EU referendum. It warns that there is now \u201cclear blue water\u201d between wages and inflation, adding that: There was growing concern in the City today that the hit to consumer spending power combined with political uncertainty following the loss of Theresa May\u2019s Commons majority will further undermine already slowing economic growth. Strangely, the front page doesn\u2019t mention that real wages also fell through most of their editor\u2019s time as chancellor (2010-2016)..... There\u2019s a danger that the political deadlock in Westminster could push inflation higher in the months ahead, warns Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation. And that could be particularly bad news for poorer families, if essential purchases like food and clothes keep climbing while benefits remain capped. Clarke says: \u201cThe latest rise in inflation adds further pressure to already shrinking pay packets. The uncertain political environment, coupled with Brexit negotiations beginning in six days\u2019 time, is already having an impact on sterling and could create further inflationary pressures down the track. \u201cThe latest rise in inflation will be a double blow to low-income working families, who are also seeing their tax credits fall in value as they have been frozen in cash terms. Many will wonder whether the \u2018end of austerity\u2019 announced by the Prime Minister last night could mean a softening of the ongoing benefits freeze. \u201cWith no sign yet of pay settlements responding to rising inflation, Britain\u2019s renewed pay squeeze looks set to be longer and deeper than many originally expected.\u201d Ben Lord, who manages M&amp;G\u2019s UK Inflation Linked Corporate Bond Fund, predicts that CPI inflation will peak at 3% later this year. He also believes the Bank of England will resist any pressure to raise interest rates in response: At this point, with such high uncertainty about the direction of travel into Brexit negotiations, but with very significant downside risks, it seems extremely unlikely the Bank of England will tighten policy at this point. With so little evidence of domestic inflation pressures, and with most inflation coming from \u2018transient\u2019 and exogenous forces, governor Mark Carney will look through CPI at 3%, 4% even 5% perhaps. In fact, if Brexit negotiations commence poorly, and if the government can\u2019t get anything done without a workable majority and now with a viable and sizeable opposition, I would still argue that Carney\u2019s last move at the helm may be in the looser direction. Britain\u2019s inflation rate has been driven higher by the slump in the pounce since June\u2019s referendum, tweets Conservative MP George Freeman: Freeman argued we should remain in the EU. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, has sent over some advice on coping with inflation: check you\u2019re on a fixed rate energy tariff (one that guarantees the price you pay per unit) and if not switch make sure your savings are earning an interest rate that\u2019s higher than the rate of inflation \u2013 otherwise they\u2019ll lose buying power over time \u2013 you might need to think about high interest current accounts shop around for food and fuel so you\u2019re not paying any more than you need to check whether you could cut your mortgage repayments by switching to a fixed rate deal if you\u2019re on your lender\u2019s SVR The Child Poverty Action Group is urging the government to help struggling families cope with the ravages of inflation. Chief executive Alison Garnham says: \u201cUnless there\u2019s an urgent re-think of the current freeze on benefits, the living standards of ordinary families will slip and slide downwards with serious consequences, particularly for children. Families are saying they can\u2019t manage. They need some leeway. Now is the time to ensure that benefits for working and non-working families once again reflect their needs and so rise with inflation. \u201cThe failure to uprate benefits in line with inflation is the single biggest driver behind child poverty rising to 4 million and why it\u2019s set to rise to over 5 million by the end of the new parliament.\u201d This chart from Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway shows how Britain is now experiencing its second real wage squeeze since the financial crisis: The Telegraph\u2019s Ben Wright points out that inflation is higher than the City, or the Bank of England, expected: Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, says inflation has hit \u201ceye-watering\u201d levels. \u201cRising prices coupled with lacklustre earnings growth means our wages aren\u2019t keeping up with the rising cost living. Our real income are being squeezed and we\u2019re witnessing this impacting UK consumer spending, which fell for the first time in nearly four years in May as consumers tightened their belts. This is bad news for an economy which relies on confident consumers spending on goods and services - already we are seeing signs of a stagnating economy as confidence among companies and consumers falter. Election result paralysis will only add to the UK economy\u2019s woes. Readers may remember that inflation was rather higher back in the 1970s -- but the key point is that wages aren\u2019t keeping pace. Currie explains why inflation is a concern: \u201cInflation never seems like a problem until suddenly it is and while it may be good news for borrowers, as it erodes the value of their debts, it has detrimental implications for savers, investors and retirees, chipping away at the value of future interest and dividend payments and eroding the worth of your capital pot. Once pricing pressures become entrenched, consumers\u2019 feel the pain, businesses don\u2019t invest and the stock market gets worried. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says the government must respond to the wage squeeze by ending the 1% cap on public sector pay rises: \u201cThe election showed that working people are struggling. And the biggest price rises in four years won\u2019t provide any comfort. \u201cWorking people are still \u00a320 a week off worse, on average, than they were before the crash \u2013 and now rising prices are hammering their pay packets again. \u201cThe new government must stop the real wage slide. Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs all around the UK. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time to lift the artificial pay restrictions in the public sector. Our hardworking nurses and teachers are long overdue a pay rise.\u201d Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Britains\u2019 household finance squeeze has intensified, warns Ben Brettell, senior economist at financial services group Hargreaves Lansdown: Today\u2019s numbers from the ONS showed inflation jumped to a fresh four-year high of 2.9%, as a fall in the price of motor fuels failed to offset higher prices for energy, food and recreational goods. Lower air fares also had a downward effect as the Easter holiday drops out of the calculation. Economists had expected the rate to remain at 2.7%. Wage data out tomorrow is expected to confirm pay is shrinking in real terms, and a report out yesterday from Visa confirms consumers are under pressure, with spending falling 0.8% year-on-year in May. Here\u2019s our news story on today\u2019s inflation report: UK inflation jumped to a four-year high of 2.9% in May, signalling a sustained fall in living standards as prices rose faster than wages. The consumer prices index went up from 2.7% in April and has been steadily increasing since the Brexit vote a year ago, which triggered a sharp drop in the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Inflation was 0.3% in May 2016, a month before the EU referendum. At 2.9%, inflation is higher than average year-on-year wage growth of 2.1% in the three months to March, putting pressure on household budgets. It is also well above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Economists had expected inflation to stay at 2.7%. Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said inflation was likely to rise further in the coming months, as the weaker pound continues to feed through to higher shop prices. \u201cOur view is that inflation will rise steadily to a little above 3% by the summer,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, should sterling resume an upward trend and energy prices slip further in US dollar terms, there is a chance that inflation remains below the 3% level.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson has responded to the jump in inflation, saying: \u2018The government is helping families with the everyday cost of living by keeping taxes low, freezing fuel duty and increasing the National Living Wage. A typical basic rate taxpayer now pays \u00a31,000 less income tax than in 2010 and increases in the National Living Wage mean \u00a31,400 extra a year for a worker since its introduction.\u2019 Here\u2019s more detail from the Office for National Statistics about why inflation jumped to 2.9% last month: The largest upward effect came from a variety of recreational and cultural goods and services with prices rising, overall, by 0.9% between April and May 2017 compared with a fall of 0.4% a year ago. Within this category the major contribution came from games, toys and hobbies, particularly computer games. Food prices rose slightly between April and May this year compared with a fall a year ago. The latest rise continues the upward movement observed from late 2016 and comes from a variety of product groups, particularly sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery where prices of cartons and boxes of chocolates rose between April and May this year. Prices for clothing rose by 0.6% between April and May this year compared with a fall of 0.3% a year ago. The upward effect came principally from children\u2019s clothing. Sales patterns may have contributed to the price movements, as the proportion of items on sale fell between April and May this year, having risen a year ago. Prices for furniture and household goods rose by 1.2% between April and May this year, the largest rise between these two months since 2008. Between the same two months in 2016, prices rose by 0.4%. The main upward contributions came from lounge furniture and household textiles. There was also a significant upward effect from electricity as further price increases entered the index in May. This is a part of the broader housing and household services heading within which the effect is partially offset by a downward contribution from owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs. There\u2019s more inflation coming down the pipeline, warns Duncan Weldon of Resolution Group: Inflation is now rising faster than the Bank of England expected, points out Ben Chu of the Independent. This chart, from Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever, shows the impact of higher inflation on pay packets: The rise in inflation means that the cost of living squeeze has worsened. Earnings figures due tomorrow are expected to show that basic pay only rose by 2.0% in the last quarter, meaning they won\u2019t have kept pace with inflation. This charts hows how the Consumer Price Index has jumped to its highest level since June 2013 (the yellow line). This shows how the cost of living has risen over the last year: Food, energy and recreational costs all helped to push inflation up in May. The Office for National Statistics say: Rising prices for recreational and cultural goods and services (particularly games, toys and hobbies) was the main contributor to the increase in the rate. There were smaller upward contributions from increased electricity and food prices. These upward contributions were partially offset by falls in motor fuel prices, and air and sea fares, the latter two influenced by the timing of Easter in April this year. Breaking! Britain\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 2.9% in May - a new four-year high. More to follow.... The pound has now crept back over $1.27, a gain of half a cent today. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted some handy charts on inflation, ahead of May\u2019s consumer prices index report (due in around 10 minutes). This shows how inflation has risen sharply in recent months: This shows how it can take up to two years for a change in the value of the pound to fully feed into the economy: This shows how global food prices have stopped rising recently: And this show how the price of oil, in pound, surged after the Brexit vote: Merlin Entertainment, which runs many of Britain\u2019s largest theme parks and tourists attractions, has warned that demand has fallen since the terror attacks in London and Manchester. Shares in Merlin have fallen by 3%, to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, after it told that City that fewer domestic tourists have been making day trips to its sites - whihc include Alton Towers, the Sea Life centres, and Legoland. Nick Varney, Merlin\u2019s chief executive, struck a suitably upbeat and uncowed tone, saying: \u201cThe impact of recent terror attacks on our London attractions is unclear at this stage.\u201d \u201cWhat is clear, however, is that London has bounced back before and will do again. I have every confidence in the longer term resilience and growth trajectory of the market. London is very much open for business, welcoming visitors from the UK and from around the world to this exciting and vibrant city.\u201d More here: European stock markets have risen in early trading, with the FTSE 100 gaining around 0.25%. The pound is also pushing back towards $1.27 ahead of today\u2019s inflation data. Connor Campbell of SpreadEX believes the City is welcoming the prospect of a softer Brexit (assuming Michael Barnier finally gets some company at the negotiating table): The pound has woken in a better mood than it did yesterday, lifting 0.2% against the dollar and 0.3% against the euro. The FTSE also looked a bit chirpier, rising 0.3% to sit at 7530. art of that positivity will stem from this morning\u2019s Reuters poll stating that the risk of a \u2018hard\u2019 Brexit has fallen following Theresa May\u2019s failure to secure a Tory majority; that\u2019s not the same as the PM now chasing a \u2018soft\u2019 exit from the EU, but it\u2019s still good news for sterling. Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who campaigned to leave the EU last year, has dropped a hint that Britain is inching away from a hard Brexit. City traders should also take note that Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is running out of patience. Barnier has told the Financial Times that Britain risks crashing out of the EU in March 2019 without a deal on future relations if it \u201cwastes\u201d more time. Barnier pointed out that no progress has been made since Britain triggered Article 50 in March, saying: \u201cNext week, it will be three months after the sending of the Article 50 letter. \u201cWe haven\u2019t negotiated, we haven\u2019t progressed. Thus we must begin this negotiation. We are ready as soon as the UK itself is ready.\u201d In a sign of exasperation, Barnier even pointed out that he can\u2019t negotiate with himself! Here\u2019s some reaction from our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin: Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada agree that last week\u2019s election shock has changed the Brexit landscape. But they\u2019re not sure, though, that Britain can maintain in the Single Market: Calls for a so-called \u2018soft\u2019 Brexit need to be weighed against the reality that both Labour and the Conservatives had manifesto commitments to take the UK out of the Single Market. In any case, it looks as though the existence of a minority government with less authority in the House of Commons is set to fuel expectations that the UK\u2019s Brexit strategy could be modified in some way. During the campaign, Theresa May repeatedly said that \u201cno deal was better than a bad deal\u201d. But there are signs that this position is, well, softening. My colleagues Anushka Asthana and Jessica Elgot reported last night that: Senior insiders say one of the ideas actively being considered to win backing across parliament was \u201cnot to major\u201d on the controversial \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d position taken by May before the election. Also under consideration is whether to exclude overseas students from the immigration numbers and even possibly to abandon the target to reduce immigration to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d. Although nothing has been agreed, any softening of the position on immigration could maximise the chance of a closer economic relationship with the EU. As the dust settles from last week\u2019s general election, economists are coming to the conclusion that Britain is less likely to exit the EU with a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019. That\u2019s according to a new poll of City experts from Reuters, who say: The chances of Britain ending up outside the single market when Brexit talks are concluded have receded somewhat after last week\u2019s election, although the pound might weaken further against other currencies, a Reuters poll of economists found. Around two-thirds of the economists polled this week, 33 out of 49, said the chance of a hard Brexit had receded somewhat. Three said it had receded significantly, while eight said there was no change. Five said it had increased somewhat and none said increased significantly. \u201cThe prime minister may have to change her stance and approach to Brexit following the election outcome,\u201d said Nikesh Sawjani at Lloyds Banking Group. More here: Likelihood of hard Brexit recedes after UK election - Reuters poll of economists Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. We\u2019re about to find out how much damage the weak pound did to UK household budgets. New inflation data, due at 9.30am, is expected to show that prices rose by 2.7% year-on-year in May. That would match the four-year high struck in April, and mean that prices in the shops are rising faster than wages [which only rose by 2.1% in the year to March]. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says the figures come at a crucial time for the economy: We get to look under the bonnet of the UK economy this week, at a time when there is rising evidence that the UK consumer having enjoyed a post Brexit shopping spree is now scaling back as inflation starts to eat away at average earnings. Having started this year at 1.8% CPI inflation hit 2.7% in April and looks set to stay at this level in the latest May numbers which are due out later this morning. Core prices have also jumped sharply since the beginning of the year from 1.6% to 2.4% in April, though we are expected to see a slight moderation in the May numbers to 2.3%. There could be a silver lining given recent falls in oil prices, which might suggest that we\u2019ve seen a short term plateau for prices which could see prices start to fall back. Input prices in the last few months have shown some signs of falling back, and in both the US and the EU inflation has shown some signs of falling back which would be good news for hard pressed consumers, when wages are currently lagging behind. We also get a new report on Britain\u2019s housing market, which may show that prices rose at a slower rate in April. So it will be a busy morning for City traders, who\u2019ll have one eye on the economic data, and the other one on political developments after Britain\u2019s general election. The pound has clawed back a little ground this morning, after hitting eight-month lows against the euro yesterday. It\u2019s currently trading around \u20ac1.132, up 0.2%. Today, prime minister Theresa May is meeting DUP leader Arlene Foster to discuss a possible deal to prop up a minority Conservative administration. Last night, the PM apologised to her backbenchers for leading the party into such a mess. Senior colleagues have been making supportive noises, but May still looks weak and vulnerable - even if her premiership isn\u2019t over quite yet. Also coming up today.. Brussels is expected to announce new proposals for how euro-denominated securities are cleared. That\u2019s important for London, which currently dominates this market but could lose this lucrative (and important) business after Brexit. City AM has the details: The City is bracing itself for the European Commission\u2019s proposed changes to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), due out on Tuesday morning. Brussels sources told City A.M. the proposals will include a mechanism giving the EU power to force relocation of euro clearing activity, which is currently dominated by London. A source familiar with the plans told City A.M.: \u201cThe commission is not going for the nuclear option.\u201d The \u201cnuclear option\u201d would have seen the commission require all clearing of euro-denominated derivatives to take place within the EU... European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, with the FTSE 100 index called up 33 points. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30am BST: UK inflation report for May 9.30am BST: UK house price index for April 10am BST: German ZEW investor confidence report",

The government has recognised that voters are unhappy about falling living standards and have had enough of cuts. Deficit reduction will now play second fiddle to the need to raise real incomes, so expect a generous uplift in the minimum wage and an easing of curbs on public sector pay as signs that the age of austerity is over.</p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/13/incomes-theresa-may-inflation-conservatives-austerity\">Incomes squeeze denied May a landslide \u2013 now she must change course</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593ff7e8e4b0bdd87e2f663f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-13T14:43:13.769Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rising prices are bad news for those who have managed to save money, particularly if they\u2019re relying on savings income (as many pensioners are).</strong></p> <p>M&amp;S have calculated that the gap between the interest rate on cash savings and inflation is the widest since November 2011.</p> <p><strong>That means savings, as well as wages, are shrinking in real terms.</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c00620d961f8052b03160e658ad0027871bc73e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c00620d961f8052b03160e658ad0027871bc73e/0_0_596_447/500.png\" alt=\"Savings vs inflation\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Ritu Vohora, </strong>Investment Director a<strong>t M&amp;G, </strong>has the details:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAt this rate, \u00a35,000 left in an average bank account would lose \u00a3137.50, in real terms after the effects of inflation, over the next 12 months.</p> <p>\u201cAll investments come with some risk, but these rock bottom net savings rates carry the very real risk of eroding wealth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow could be the right time to consider whether investing in stocks and shares could be a better way to protect against inflation, and achieve your long-term financial goals.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-593ff03be4b0bdd87e2f6614\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/nadia-khomami\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-06-13T14:17:30.557Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">CBI chief: We've got to get Brexit right after election earthquake</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"60813a0e8b09dccf37abf277c94f89472d4f6a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60813a0e8b09dccf37abf277c94f89472d4f6a0c/0_0_3850_2567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CBI Director General, Carolyn Fairbairn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>The head of the Confederation of British Industry has called Thursday\u2019s general election a political earthquake, but said it\u2019s an opportunity for a different kind of Brexit in which the voice of common sense is heard.</strong></p> <p>Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, also warned Theresa May that for businesses across the UK, particularly in Northern Ireland, a soft border in the country was fundamental.<br></p> <p>\u201cClearly it was just a political earthquake last Thursday.

      "bodyText": "The man who helped secure Britain\u2019s first new nuclear power station in a generation will step down as chief executive of EDF Energy in October, marking the end of a 15-year tenure. Vincent de Rivaz is the longest-serving CEO among the heads of the UK\u2019s big six energy suppliers and will be replaced on 1 November by Simone Rossi, who leads the company\u2019s international division. The outgoing chief executive led EDF\u2019s successful but often torturous efforts to clinch a subsidy deal with the government for nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. He also oversaw its acquisition of Britain\u2019s ageing nuclear infrastructure in 2008. De Rivaz did not say why he was stepping down, but it is understood that he was satisfied after getting the much-maligned and heavily delayed Hinkley contract over the line. He has been at the French state-owned company for nearly 40 years. In a message to staff, De Rivaz said that during his leadership: \u201cI have no doubt that at the same time we will have strengthened even more our confidence in our future\u201d. He said a decision on him leaving was made several months ago, but an announcement had been deferred until a successor was in place. De Rivaz promised staff he would ensure a \u201ca seamless handover\u201d. Rossi, an Italian who joined EDF as chief financial officer in 2011, will face the Herculean task of ensuring the reactors at Hinkley are delivered by 2025. Projects in Finland and France utilising the same reactor design have run hugely over budget and behind schedule. On Monday, the new French ecology minister, Nicolas Hulot, said France would be closing some of its nuclear power stations to meet a goal of reducing the country\u2019s reliance on nuclear from 75% to 50% of energy generation.",

      "bodyText": "Anyone seeking an explanation for the bloody nose received by the government in the election should start with wages, prices and living standards. Sure, the Conservatives fought a terrible campaign. True, Theresa May\u2019s shortcomings were exposed. No question, the mobilisation of young voters by Labour played a big part in the result. But the bedrock of any successful election campaign is the state of the economy and, in particular, whether or not people are becoming better off. In May 2015, when David Cameron won, real incomes were rising. Currently, as the latest inflation figures show, voters are getting poorer. Cameron could hardly have chosen a better moment to go to the country. In the spring of 2015, the collapse in the oil price meant the annual inflation rate was hovering around zero. Average earnings were rising by almost 3% a year, which meant living standards were increasing by a similar amount. According to the Office for National Statistics, the annual inflation rate as measured by the consumer prices index was 2.9% in May, while earnings in the three months to April were 2.1% up on the same period a year earlier. The figures for May will be released on Wednesday, but are unlikely to show much change to the recent squeeze on living standards. The upward pressure on prices initially came from a recovery in oil prices, but has subsequently been the result of the fall in the value of the pound, which has made imports dearer. For a time, UK consumers were protected from the impact of the weakness of sterling because importers were hedged against currency movements. But those hedges have now expired, leaving retailers with little choice but to raise prices. Had May won the landslide she was clearly expecting, the government would have been able to ride out this difficult period. Inflation is likely to go up a bit further, but the ONS\u2019s separate figures for producer output prices, which measure the cost of goods leaving factory gates and provide a guide to inflationary pressure early in the pipeline, appear to have peaked. Moreover, weaker consumer spending will result in lower growth and this will eventually feed through into a fall in inflation. But May is a weakened prime minister heading a minority administration and she doesn\u2019t have time on her side. The government has recognised that voters are unhappy about falling living standards and have had enough of cuts. Deficit reduction will now play second fiddle to the need to raise real incomes, so expect a generous uplift in the minimum wage and an easing of curbs on public sector pay as signs that the age of austerity is over.",

      "bodyText": "Carlsberg has unveiled plans to reduce its brewery carbon emissions to zero, singling out Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate agreement as a motivating factor. The Danish brewer, whose beers also include Holsten Pils and San Miguel, said it would eliminate brewery emissions and halve its water usage by 2030 as part of a new sustainability drive. This will include closing down small coal power stations at breweries in China, India and Poland, replacing them with renewable sources such as solar panels and biogas. Carlsberg\u2019s resolve to go green had been hardened by Trump announcing plans for the US to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, its chief executive Cees t\u2018Hart said. \u201cPeople in Carlsberg are more energised after Trump said no to the Paris agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel we can take responsibility in our own hands and don\u2019t need to depend on politicians for this. You could argue it\u2019s a drop in the ocean, but if everybody says that we won\u2019t make any progress.\u201d T\u2019Hart said Carlsberg\u2019s plans, which include using only renewable energy to brew beer by 2022, were equivalent to taking 160,000 cars off the road. The company does not expect to incur extra costs because it will shift investment from elsewhere in the business and expects the sustainability plan to reduce costs, such as energy bills, over time. It will also hire PhD students to work in its laboratories on ways to reduce its carbon footprint and ask suppliers, such as firms that make packaging or grow barley, to implement their own environmental measures. As well as aiming for zero emissions, Carlsberg will also step up its alcohol-free offering to target irresponsible drinking. T\u2019Hart said this was partly aimed at a \u201cmillennial generation\u201d that drinks less than older people, as well as pregnant women and health-conscious consumers ditching sugary soft drinks.",

      "bodyText": "British Airways is close to striking an agreement for Capita to run its call centres as the airline attempts to improve its customer relations after its disastrous IT meltdown last month. Under the agreement, Capita, an outsourcing group that has had its own public relations disasters in the past with its management of London\u2019s congestion charge and NHS administration, would take over the almost 10m calls a year made to BA staff in Newcastle upon Tyne and Manchester. Questions were asked about cost-cutting at British Airways after a system meltdown left 75,000 passengers stranded over a May bank holiday weekend, with unions highlighting the hundreds of skilled staff who had been made redundant in recent years. But BA\u2019s parent company, IAG, denied any link between outsourcing and the recent problems, and the airline group appears determined to cut costs further. The customer service centres were the focus of criticism as some passengers struggled to get information when hundreds of flights were cancelled. About 1,100 staff are employed across the two call centres. The GMB union said it was a \u201cshort-sighted\u201d move from BA. Mick Rix, national officer for aviation, said: \u201cDespite record profits, this is the latest penny wise and pound foolish plan from IAG BA and is consistent with those that led to the IT meltdown. \u201cHardworking, loyal and dedicated GMB members are to be rewarded with the outsourcing of their jobs to the lowest-price bidder.\u201d A BA spokesman said: \u201cTo ensure we can offer the highest standards of service to customers, taking advantage of the latest developments in technology, we are conducting a review of our global call centre operations. As part of this review we are talking with Capita about the services they provide.\u201d In a trading update, Capita confirmed it had \u201centered a period of exclusive engagement with British Airways to explore forming a potential partnership to support its global customer contact operations\u201d. It said that no final decisions regarding the outcome of this engagement had been made. Capita\u2019s own problems have mounted in 2017. Its chief executive, Andy Parker, stepped down after profits fell by 33% in March. The company said on Tuesday it had secured\u00a3318m in contracts and extensions so far this year \u2013 including for the Northern Ireland government and the RSPCA \u2013 adding that it was bidding for work worth a further \u00a33.8bn. It said there was \u201ca shortlist of strong candidates\u201d to succeed Parker, in what would be \u201ca transitional year for the group\u201d, with profits improving in the second half of the year. Capita\u2019s shares were the biggest risers in the FTSE 250 index, jumping 13%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK inflation rose to a four-year high in May as the pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote worked its way through the economy, intensifying the squeeze on household budgets. The increasing cost of computer games and package holidays helped push up inflation to 2.9% last month, above the expectation of economists that it would remain at the 2.7% rate seen in April. The year-on-year rise in the consumer prices index (CPI) means prices continue to go up faster than wages for many workers, further denting living standards. Inflation has been steadily increasing since the EU referendum result a year ago, which triggered a sharp drop in the value of the pound and pushed up the cost of goods imported from abroad. Inflation was 0.3% in May 2016, a month before the Brexit vote. Higher oil prices have also added to the upward pressure on inflation. But in the latest official figures, there was evidence that sterling was a key factor. Statisticians highlighted the rising prices of package holidays, reflecting the growing cost of travelling abroad for Britons because of the weaker pound. The Office for National Statistics said higher food and electricity prices also contributed to the inflation figure. This continues a pattern of essentials becoming increasingly expensive, leaving households with less to spend on treats. Consumer spending has slowed as a result, holding back the pace of overall economic growth. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said the inflation figures underlined the pressure on the new government to help households cope with rising living costs. \u201cThe election showed that working people are struggling. And the biggest price rises in four years won\u2019t provide any comfort,\u201d she said. \u201cWorking people are still \u00a320 a week worse off, on average, than they were before the crash, and now rising prices are hammering their pay packets again. The new government must stop the real wage slide. Ministers must focus on delivering better-paid jobs all around the UK.\u201d Tim Roache, the general secretary of the GMB union, said: \u201cToo often there is more month than money left after pay day. Ending the public sector pay freeze and making sure all workers are paid a decent wage is an absolute must and it needs to be on the agenda for the Queen\u2019s speech.\u201d A Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe government is helping families with the everyday cost of living by keeping taxes low, freezing fuel duty and increasing the \u2018national living wage\u2019.\u201d Inflation remains higher than the average wage growth of 2.1% year on year in the three months to March. Wage figures due on Wednesday were expected to show the gap between underlying pay growth and the inflation increase widened further in April. The higher-than-expected inflation figure will intensify the debate over how long the Bank of England may leave interest rates at the record low of 0.25%. Inflation is well above the Bank\u2019s 2% target, but policymakers have said they are happy to tolerate some overshoot because they want to support growth and employment as the UK prepares to begin Brexit negotiations. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) will meet this week to set interest rates and announce its decision at noon on Thursday. Oliver Kolodseike, a senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research consultancy, said: \u201cUnder normal circumstances, the Bank of England would have a sufficient set of arguments to justify an interest rate rise. \u201cThat said, the recent rise in inflation was partly driven by external factors such as the oil price and the depreciation of the pound ... Another argument for the Bank to keep monetary policy on hold is that a rise in interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing, at a time at which consumers are already feeling a squeeze on their incomes as wage growth remains stubbornly low. \u201cAdd to this uncertainty regarding the UK\u2019s future outside the European Union and it seems sensible for the Bank to keep interest rates at their current levels.\u201d The ONS figures showed that its preferred measure of inflation, CPIH, which includes owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs, hit a five-year high of 2.7% in May, up from 2.6% in April. Its measure of how much manufacturers are having to pay for raw materials and energy showed that these cost pressures continued to ease off last month. Input prices increased by 11.6% in the year to May, down from a 15.6% rise in the year to April. This took pressure off companies to raise the prices they charge customers, and factory gate inflation held at 3.6% in May for the third month in a row Jonathan Athow, the ONS deputy national statistician, said: \u201cThe rate of increase in factory gate prices has levelled now that manufacturing input costs have started to fall back.\u201d Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said this pattern supported a view that the struggling pound had fed through faster than expected, rather than by a larger amount. \u201cThe effects of the lower pound already appear to be fading at the start of the production pipeline,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, it takes time for rises in producer prices to feed through to prices in the shops, and as a result, we think that CPI inflation will rise a bit further in the second half of the year, peaking at about 3.2% in the fourth quarter. But inflation is likely to drop back quickly in 2018 as the impact of the lower pound begins to fade.\u201d",

Another argument for the Bank to keep monetary policy on hold is that a rise in interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing, at a time at which consumers are already feeling a squeeze on their incomes as wage growth remains stubbornly low. </p> \n<p>\u201cAdd to this uncertainty regarding the UK\u2019s future outside the European Union and it seems sensible for the Bank to keep interest rates at their current levels.\u201d<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8d33cd56-7223-4c2b-a0d2-9ba7e6cf445e\" data-atom-type=\"explainer\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Explainer\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The ONS figures showed that its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39328173\">preferred measure of inflation</a>, CPIH, which includes owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs, hit a five-year high of 2.7% in May, up from 2.6% in April.</p> \n<p>Its measure of how much manufacturers are having to pay for raw materials and energy showed that these cost pressures continued to ease off last month. Input prices increased by 11.6% in the year to May, down from a 15.6% rise in the year to April. This took pressure off companies to raise the prices they charge customers, and factory gate inflation held at 3.6% in May for the third month in a row</p> \n<p>Jonathan Athow, the ONS deputy national statistician, said: \u201cThe rate of increase in factory gate prices has levelled now that manufacturing input costs have started to fall back.\u201d</p> \n<p>Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said this pattern supported a view that the struggling pound had fed through faster than expected, rather than by a larger amount.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe effects of the lower pound already appear to be fading at the start of the production pipeline,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cOf course, it takes time for rises in producer prices to feed through to prices in the shops, and as a result, we think that CPI inflation will rise a bit further in the second half of the year, peaking at about 3.2% in the fourth quarter. But inflation is likely to drop back quickly in 2018 as the impact of the lower pound begins to fade.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Employers in Britain are planning to take on new workers over coming months despite looming Brexit negotiations and slower economic growth, according to a survey. A poll of 2,109 employers by recruitment agency ManpowerGroup found that a net balance of 5% were planning to increase staff levels rather than cut them over the July-to-September quarter. That was unchanged from the previous poll three months ago but down slightly from a +7% reading at the end of 2016 when the UK economy was still growing strongly. Since the start of this year, the economy has lost steam as consumers have cut back on spending amid rising cost pressures. The pound\u2019s sharp fall since the Brexit vote has made imports more expensive and official figures due on Tuesday are expected to show that inflation held at its highest level for more than three years last month. ManpowerGroup said employers were still intending to increase their workforces on average in the coming quarter, with employers most optimistic in Yorkshire and Humberside, the south-east and West Midlands. \u201cEmployers have faced a triple whammy of uncertainty over the last few months \u2013 a snap election, the triggering of article 50, and weak economic data for the first half of 2017. You might have expected hiring confidence to have taken a real hit, but employers have been standing firm,\u201d said James Hick, the managing director of ManpowerGroup Solutions. The recruitment firm highlighted stark contrasts between sectors. Manufacturers were most optimistic about hiring but the outlook for the public sector was far gloomier, with a majority of employers looking to cut jobs. The poll, conducted during campaigning for the snap general election, found a net balance of 7% of manufacturers expected to increase their workforce over the coming quarter. ManpowerGroup put some of the strength down to investment, citing plans by the maker of Dulux paint, AkzoNobel, to open a new plant in Ashington, Northumberland. Hick also cited support for manufacturers which export thanks to the boost to competitiveness from a weaker pound. \u201cManufacturing is the standout sector this quarter, driven by investment from outside the UK; following the shock election result, currency is cheap and sterling\u2019s weakness is manufacturing\u2019s strength,\u201d he said. The hiring balance for the public sector fell to a six-year low of -6%, suggesting employers were planning to shrink their workforces despite signs the next government would ease up on austerity. \u201cBoth main parties pledged a rise in NHS spending. However, with the public sector outlook in the doldrums, employers don\u2019t seem to think that hiring is going up any time soon,\u201d said Hick. ManpowerGroup said the inconclusive election result could turn out to be positive for those employers, including in the NHS, which had been worrying about access to workers after Brexit. \u201cThe election result throws into question the Conservative commitment to slash immigration to the tens of thousands and double the levy on non-EU workers to \u00a32,000,\u201d said Hick.",
