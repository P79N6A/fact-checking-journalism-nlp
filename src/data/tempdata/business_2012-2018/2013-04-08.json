Having adopted a full package of austerity measures two years ago, the country finds its budget deficit has not closed according to the intended timetable and actually widened last year to 6.4% of GDP. Nor has growth returned. Instead, the economy is expected to contract by a further 2.3% this year and the rate of unemployment stands at almost 18%. Now comes a constitutional and political crisis. The courts have shot down four out of nine measures the prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, wanted to adopt. He says he will now make alternative cuts in the health, education and welfare budgets to try to meet the (revised) deficit-reduction goals and keep the Troika happy. Passos Coelho's strategy may keep the position stable for a while. Assuming the government survives and implements its new spending cuts, the real crisis could be delayed until next year. Certainly, the chances of Portugal being able to fund itself fully in the market this year are roughly zero: the 10-year bond yield is 6.45% and rising. Barclays Capital's analysts think \"at best\" full market access \"may occur in 2014\". If it doesn't, though, and if the deficit-reduction target is again blown out of the water, we're back in fresh bail-out territory if nothing else changes. But Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, thinks something should change. He suggested that the maturity of loans to Portugal should be extended. That's a sensible suggestion since nobody can seriously argue that the country has been dragging its feet. There's a strong moral case for cutting Lisbon some slack. The next step, of course, should be for the eurozone to find some pro-growth strategies and shed its austerity obsession. Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, is making that argument and his timing is good. If the pain inflicted on compliant Portugal leads only to a second bail-out, plan A is a flop. It's time to try something new. Whether Germany is listening, though, is another matter entirely. To judge by current rhetoric, it's not.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "I think that's the lot for today. Here's a very quick closing summary: \u2022 America has renewed its pressure on Europe to relax its austerity programmes and drive growth. US treasury secretary Jack Lew used a visit to Brussels to urge top officials to prioritise economic recovery. (see 1.35pm onwards) \u2022 Portugal has been jolted by its constitutional court's decision on Friday night to reject parts of the country's austerity budget. The country's prime minister insisted last night that spending will be cut to keep the bailout programme on track (see 7.57am).. ....but analysts warned that the court ruling is a blow to Portugal's changes of hitting its targets (see this round up). \u2022 Shares fell in Lisbon, but other markets weren't badly hit (see 5.50pm) \u2022 Tonight, European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso called for eurozone officials to give Portugal an extension to its bailout loans. (see 5.21pm) \u2022 Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has called for the European Central Bank to follow other central banks with extra stimulus measures (see 4.40pm). \u2022 On the economics front, eurozone investor confidence has been hit by the Cyprus bailout (see 9.35am) while German industrial production rose in February but was revised down for January (see 11.16am) \u2022 And the yen hit new three-year lows against other currencies as the Bank of Japan launched its massive stimulus programme this morning (see 10.11am). I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks and good night. Government ministers in Portugal will meet on Tuesday to discuss its economic reform plans, according to journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo: Shares in Portugal were hit by the new uncertainty over its bailout plan, pushing its main index down at the close of trading. Many other markets were almost flat, though: Portuguese PSI 20: down 78 points at 5,558, -1.39% FTSE 100: up 27 points at 6,276, +0.4% German DAX: up 3 points at 7,662, + 0.05% French CAC: up 3 points at 3,666. +0.1% Italian FTSE MIB: down 7 points at 15,243. -0.05% Spanish IBEX: down 11 points at 7,787, - 0.14% European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has issued a statement on Portugal tonight. In it, he urges eurozone finance ministers to hurry up and agree to give the country another year's grace on its bailout loan. He then appeals to \"institutions\" and politicians across the political spectrum in Portugal to work together to meet its bailout targets. National unity, Barroso argues, is vital. Yet, it wasn't a group of opposition MPs who thwarted Passos Coelho's plans. It was the country's lawyers - applying national law. Anyway, here's Barroso's statement: What matters now is to find a solution. And, as you know, the European Commission already released a communiqu\u00e9 on the situation following the Constitutional Court's decision yesterday. What I can say is that we welcome the Portuguese Government's reaffirmed commitment to carrying through the adjustment programme. This is vital. It is vital in order to maintain and boost Portugal's credibility, and to enable the country to find under its own steam the funding its economy needs. And now, as regards the next steps, the European Commission has already declared \u2013 and I can confirm \u2013 that we support extending the maturities of the loans granted to Portugal. But this is a decision which goes beyond our remit; it is a decision to be taken by the Ministers of Finance of all the eurozone governments. However, we do think this decision should be taken as soon as possible, and that it will improve Portugal's prospects of a return to the markets and enhance the credibility of the adjustment programme, thereby lending support to the remarkable efforts undertaken by Portugal in recent times, not least of which are the sacrifices made by the Portuguese people. In my judgement, the determination shown by Portugal in implementing the programme will prove a crucial factor in obtaining this extension and, more generally, in making implementation a success. At the same time, we think it important that these efforts should be based on a national consensus. I have already noted, and I shall reiterate the point, that the debate in Portugal naturally involves the Government, the Opposition, and a number of political parties, and even encompasses criticism of one institution or another on occasion. But beyond that, what is the centre of attention is the country itself, Portugal as a whole. And what interests Portugal's partners \u2013 notably the eurozone countries, because it is ultimately they that will be taking the decisions \u2013 is whether or not Portugal has the will to abide by the commitments it has entered into, and the determination at national level to fulfil them. This is why I am once more appealing to Portugal's institutions and main political forces, particularly those that are linked in one way or another to the programme's implementation, to cooperate together to ensure success, and to avoid prolonging the sacrifices already being borne by the Portuguese people. Portugal's lenders will be paying an early visit to Lisbon again following the constitutional court's decision to block pay and benefit cuts in this year's austerity budget. The last quarterly visit took place last month, so the Portuguese government could have been spared the delights of a Troika visit until June. Now, though, an extra visit is expected: A finance ministry spokeswoman told Reuters: The court decision created an uncertainty which justifies this visit in-between reviews, as do the spending cuts that the government promised to present by the end of April or beginning of May. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called for a debate on Monday as to whether the European Central Bank\u2019s powers should be extended in line with the Bank of Japan's new stimulus. My colleague in Madrid, Martin Roberts, reports that Rajoy warned that individual countries cannot drag themselves back to growth without more help, arguing that \"What nation states do by themselves is not enough\". \u201cI think in Europe, we should all ponder whether the ECB should have the same powers as the rest of the world\u2019s central banks,\u201d Rajoy told journalists after a meeting with David Cameron \u2013 who promptly flew back to London on hearing of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s death. The ECB\u2019s remit since its foundation, meanwhile, has been mainly to rein in inflation, and it has drawn criticism for not cutting interest rates further to revive the euro zone's slumping economy. Rajoy also repeated appeals for a European banking union which he has made since his conservative People\u2019s Party took office in December 2011. \u201cIf we had had a banking union in the European Union, like several of us European prime ministers think, what happened in Cyprus would never have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother important issue is the need to end the current financing difficulties many countries are having,\u201d Rajoy added, without giving details of how he thought this should be done. Despite scepticism voiced by several economists, Rajoy also insisted Spain would return to growth next year after shrinking steadily since mid-2011, due to his government\u2019s rewriting labour laws and reforming the energy market. He noted that Spain\u2019s financing costs, in some cases, were better than they had been since 2010. \u201cThere will be economic growth in 2014. Make no doubt about it,\u201d he said. The BoJ's ambitious goal to double the Japanese money base over the next two years, by buying huge quantities of government bonds, goes far beyond anything attempted in the eurozone (reflecting Japan's new determination to break out of its deflationary gloom). ECB president Mario Draghi did sound more dovish last week, but a rate cut is probably the most Rajoy can hope for. Unless he applies for the safety of Draghi's bond-buying programme, the OMT... Curious action on the Greek stock market today. Shares in Eurobank tumbled by 30% at the start of trading after its merger with National Bank was abandoned (see 10.49am), but actually surged to a rise of 30% this afternoon before finishing the day up 20% in very heavy trading. Some volatility isn't uncommon for Greek banking stocks given the uncertainty over how they will be be managed, and recapitalised (and now much existing shareholders will be diluted). The afternoon rally still left Eurobank's shares worth just \u20ac0.18 tonight, from \u20ac0.70 at the start of 2013. Two years on from seeking a bailout, Portugal's austerity plan has hit the country's population hard, as AP reports: Serving a frugal lunch in their kitchen not much bigger than a bathroom, Pedro and Elena Baptista spoon stewed chicken feet onto their boiled potatoes and leave the slightly meatier wings for their 12-year-old daughter, Vania, and 7-year-old son, Joao. The Baptista family counts itself among the casualties of an unrelenting financial crisis that is squeezing the life out of some European Union economies, including Portugal. Pedro Baptista, a stocky 37-year-old, has found work as a part-time window cleaner but his wife Elena, 35, has been on welfare for almost a year after losing her job in a school canteen. Scraping by on a monthly household income of \u20ac650 ($840) and constantly going cap-in-hand to charities and family members has sapped their confidence. But Pedro is determined to stay positive. \"Ups and downs are part of life. Things will improve,\" he says. \"We just have to hold on.\" More here: Pain bites into Portuguese life as crisis deepens Quotes from Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy are hitting the Reuters terminal: \u2022 14:19 - SPAIN'S RAJOY SAYS EU MUST TAKE MEASURES TO IMPROVE FINANCING FOR MEMBERS, TO STIMULATE GROWTH \u2022 14:21 - SPAIN'S RAJOY SAYS EUROPE SHOULD CONSIDER NEW POWERS FOR ECB More to follow More details of US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's warning to Europe to make growth a bigger priority (see also 1.35pm), via AP's Juergen Baetz: \"Our economy's strength remains sensitive to events beyond our shores and we have an immense stake in Europe's health and stability,\" Lew said in Brussels. \"The Unites States has no bigger, no more important economic relationship that it does with Europe.\" Lew, who became treasury secretary in February, started his first official trip to Europe with a meeting with EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. He also met the EU's top economic and monetary official, Commissioner Olli Rehn, and EU Council President Herman Van Rompuy. \"I was particularly interested in our European partners' plans to strengthen sources of demand at a time of rising unemployment,\" he said, speaking alongside Van Rompuy. Juergen's full story is online here: US Treasury chief urges EU to ease off austerity Over in Brussels, the US Treasury secretary is on a mission to persuade European countries to relax their focus of austerity and prioritise policies that drive growth. Officially, Jacob \"Jack\" Lew's trip is billed as a chance to discuss \"economic developments in Europe and policies to boost global growth and promote financial stability.\" Lew met with European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso, as well as holding a press conference with European Council president Herman Van Rompuy. Treasury officials say Lew told Barroso clearly that Europe needs to prioritise economic growth, and also exchanged views on the Cyprus bailout. Juergen Baetz of Associated Press has the details: In his meeting with Barroso, the chief of the EU's executive arm, Lew discussed \"the need to generate demand\" to spur the economy, a Treasury official said. \"They also discussed the situation in Cyprus, which underscored the importance of moving to full banking union,\" said the official, who was speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to publicly discuss the closed-doors meeting. David Cameron was due to give a press conference with the Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy shortly in Madrid, where he would probably have spoken about his goals for EU reform (see more here). However, the death of Baroness Thatcher this morning (announced a few minutes ago) may change that. Here's a video clip of Pedro Passos Coelho, the Portuguese prime minister, giving his televised address on Sunday night: Economist Shaun Richards points out that Portugal's top judges are playing a key role fighting its corner: This is not the first time that the constitutional court has challenged the austerity programme and it is the nearest to an opposition to Euro area austerity that Portugal\u2019s authorities have. This is because her political class has in effect delegated its authority to the troika (European Commission,European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund) and their role has simply become to implement what they are told. He also flags up how the imposition of austerity to Portugal's economy (which wasn't in great shape beforehand) has sparked an \"economic collapse\", with GDP likely to shrink by at least 2.3% this year. More here: Portugal shows its resistance to reform as its economic depression deepens Nice pic via @pawelmorski (fund manager turned blogger) showing how Italian bonds have rallied back to their January highs, even though the country remains without a new government: (see 10.11am for more details of how the Bank of Japan's huge stimulus package is moving the markets) German industrial production data for February show that output rose by a brisk 0.5% in February... ... however, January's data has been revised down to -0.6% (from 0.0). Not so healthy-looking. The German finance ministry was cautious, but reckoned that demand for large equipment and machinery (capital goods) would help its manufacturers this year. It said (via Reuters): Production in the industrial sector remains restrained overall. Manufacturing output is proving to be increasingly positive, especially in the area of capital goods. Steve Collins, global head of dealing at London &amp; Capital Asset Management, described the data as 'mixed'. Over in Greece, banking shares have been hammered after a plan to merge two lenders, National Bank and Eurobank, was ditched. The Greek central bank announced last night that the two banks would be recapitalised individually, rather than combined into one company. That alarmed investors, who dumped shares rather than be heavily diluted when the government injects fresh capital. National Bank's share price slid by almost a third, helping to drag the main Greek index lower: Efthimia Efthimiou of Capital.Gr in Athens has the details: UPDATE: Greek newspaper Kathimerini is reporting that the boards of Eurobank and National Bank will both meet tomorrow (more here) Meanwhile, the yen has fallen to its lowest levels in over three years against the US dollar and the euro, as Japan cracks on with its radical new monetary stimulus plan. The Bank of Japan began its new era of aggressive easing this morning by buying up 1.2 trillion yen's worth of Japanese sovereign bonds (of five-year maturity or more). More details here. The news that the BoJ was already implementing the plan announced last week drove the Japanese currency down to 99 yen against the US dollar at one stage (its weakest point since June 2009). This was welcomed by Japanese manufacturers, who see a boost in exports looming. Currency experts reckon the yen will crunch through the Y100 level before much longer. Yesterday Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, welcomed the Bank if Japan's new strategy, arguing it will help underpin world economic growth. But as the yen falls, talk of currency wars is growing. Jane Foley, Rabobank's senior currency strategist, explains: For now endorsements from politicians such as IMF Chief Lagarde regarding the BoJ\u2019s determination to beat deflation is supporting the pressure on the yen. However, the more the yen weakens the greater the chance that the move will trigger some verbal opposition. According to the OECD the PPP estimate for USD/JPY stands around 103.9. Other measures, however, estimate fair value as low at USD/JPY 87. Currently the real effective exchange rate of Japan is trading well below the average of the past 20 years. This means the Japanese authorities will now find it difficult to argue that the yen is too expensive. Some Chinese economists and business leaders have reportedly already criticised the most recent action by the BoJ on the basis that a significantly cheaper JPY could hurt competitiveness in other countries. The greater the move in the JPY the more likely it is that a discussion about currency wars will be re-ignited. : Investor sentiment across the eurozone has fallen, according to the Sentix index (just released), as the Cyprus bailout threatened to inflame the crisis in the region. The monthly measure of investor confidence in the region dropped to -17.3, which is its lowest reading since last November. A big drop on March's -10.6. Sentix attributed the reverse in confidence to the Cypriot bailout, which came on top of the inconclusive Italian election in February: Just as the Italian election pushed down the index in March, so in April the Cyprus problem, among other issues, proved an additional burden. Not a good sign for growth.... While the Portuguese stock market fell this morning (see 8.06am), other indices are climbing back after Friday's losses, with the FTSE 100 up 25 points (+0.4%). And bond yields for most eurozone countries (alas not Portugal) are falling too.The 10-year borrowing costs on French, Dutch, Austrian and Belgian debt all hit record lows this morning. That looks like a sign of confidence in the eurozone, but actually yields have been falling (more here) since the Bank of Japan announced its plans for a massive new monetary stimulus. Of which more shortly.... Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said last night the Portuguese constitutional court has thrown 'a fast ball' at Passos Coelho's government, at a time when the European economy already looked shaky. Apparently, cutting pay and benefits for the public sector is unfair on the rest so they need to try again. The result is that there's a hole in the austerity plan and everyone else (ie Spain) is looking to see what happens. Europe has no growth plan, and austerity into recessions is unpopular. And perhaps unconstitutional..... The bottom line of all this is always the same - don't count on growth. Gary Jenkins of Swordfish Research argues that some Portuguese savers may be feeling jittery, having watched the Cyprus bailout unfold: Throughout the crisis whilst many politicians have managed to talk themselves (or more pertinently the countries borrowing costs) into trouble it has appeared that the Portuguese have adopted the old mantra of the British Royal family: Never complain, never explain. However they have now managed to put the country back in the spotlight, or the constitutional court has by rejecting some of the austerity measures that the government wished to put into place in order to allow them to meet the cost saving targets imposed as part of the bailout package. The government said that it didn\u2019t agree with the court\u2019s ruling and that it \u2018\u2026places serious difficulties on the country to comply with the\u2026budget targets it has to meet.\u2019 Portugal is supposed to hit a budget deficit target of 5.5% this year. I wonder if people / companies with savings of over \u20ac100K in Portuguese banks are feeling entirely comfortable with the situation. Ricardo Santos of BNP Paribas warned that Lisbon would struggle to renegotiate its bailout terms in the current climate, meaning the spending cuts may be unavoidable: Any negotiations on making Portugal's adjustment programme more flexible will be extremely tough... The mood in Europe has changed and it will not be easy to gain more concessions. And Antonio Garcia Pascual, chief eurozone economist at Barclays, warned that new fiscal measures, such as more tax increases, would hurt the country's already weak economy (via the FT): It\u2019s hard to see how they could find measures worth 0.8 per cent of GDP without distorting growth even further. The German government has backed Lisbon's plan to make new spending cuts, arguing that it could not escape the savings it committed to as part of its \u20ac78bn bailout. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told Bavarian radio: Portugal has made lots of progress in the last year to gain access to financial markets. But after this (constitutional court) decision it will have to find new measures. (via Reuters) A quick look at what's coming up today, via RanSquawk: \u2022 Eurozone Sentix investor confidence survey for April: 9.30am BST \u2022 Bank of Italy's balance sheet for March: 10am BST \u2022 German industrial production for February: 11am BST Portuguese government debt has also been hit in early trading, pushing up the yield (or interest rate) on its 10-year bonds to 6.6%, from 6.42% on Friday. Portugal's main share index, the PSI 20, fell 1.2% at the start of trading, Reuters reports, as traders react to the constitutional court ruling and Passos Coelho's statement last night. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the key events in the eurozone crisis and the global economy. No sooner had Cyprus been whisked out of the operation room and into intensive care than Portugal returned to casualty. Last night, embattled prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho announced that the country's health and education budgets will be slashed in an effort to avoid a second bailout. Passos Coelho warned that the country was still enduring a \"financial emergency\", exactly two years after requesting international help - and two days after his original austerity plan was derailed by the country's top judges As my colleague Martin Roberts reported last night, Passos Coelho told the nation his government would begin the \"very difficult\" process of slashing spending rather than raising taxes further. \"I shall instruct ministries to implement necessary reductions in functional spending to offset what the court ruling prohibited. It will certainly be a very difficult process,\" Pedro Passos Coelho said in a live broadcast on Sunday evening. He added that while he respected the court, its ruling would hamper government plans to take back control of its own finances from international lenders next year. The move came after Portugal's bailout programme was thrown into renewed uncertainty on Friday night, when its constitutional court dramatically blocked parts of its austerity budget. The judges ruled that planned cuts in public sector pay and state pensions were unconstitutional as they failed to share the burden fairly. That created a black hole in the country's fiscal plans, which Passos Coelho is now racing to fill. It's not clear how the education and health budgets will be hit. But the European Union has already warned Lisbon that it must stick to the terms of its \u20ac78bn bailout. In a statement last night, the EU said: Any departure from the programme's objectives, or their re-negotiation, would in fact neutralise the efforts already made and achieved by the Portuguese citizens, namely the growing investor confidence in Portugal, and prolong the difficulties from the adjustment. The Commission therefore trusts that the Portuguese Government will swiftly identify the measures necessary to adapt the 2013 budget in a way that respects the revised fiscal target as requested by the Portuguese Government and supported by the Troika in the 7th review of the programme. Portugal is already deep in recession, with public anger growing over its austerity programme growing. The Wall Street Journal even reported last night that the government had considered paying public employees and pensioners one month of their income in Treasury bills, to get around the court ruling. This was later denied by officials, although the idea could perhaps be applied to those tasked with steering Europe through the crisis.... I'll be tracking all the reaction to the developments in Portugal, and other events in the eurocrisis, through the day....",

National unity, Barroso argues, is vital.</p> <p>Yet, it wasn't a group of opposition MPs who thwarted Passos Coelho's plans. It was the country's lawyers - applying national law.</p> <p>Anyway, <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-315_en.htm\">here's Barroso's statement</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What matters now is to find a solution. And, as you know, the European Commission already released a communiqu\u00e9 on the situation following the Constitutional Court's decision yesterday. What I can say is that we welcome the Portuguese Government's reaffirmed commitment to carrying through the adjustment programme. This is vital. It is vital in order to maintain and boost Portugal's credibility, and to enable the country to find under its own steam the funding its economy needs.</p> <p>And now, as regards the next steps, the European Commission has already declared \u2013 and I can confirm \u2013 that we support extending the maturities of the loans granted to Portugal. But this is a decision which goes beyond our remit; it is a decision to be taken by the Ministers of Finance of all the eurozone governments. However, we do think this decision should be taken as soon as possible, and that it will improve Portugal's prospects of a return to the markets and enhance the credibility of the adjustment programme, thereby lending support to the remarkable efforts undertaken by Portugal in recent times, not least of which are the sacrifices made by the Portuguese people. In my judgement, the determination shown by Portugal in implementing the programme will prove a crucial factor in obtaining this extension and, more generally, in making implementation a success.</p> <p>At the same time, we think it important that these efforts should be based on a national consensus. I have already noted, and I shall reiterate the point, that the debate in Portugal naturally involves the Government, the Opposition, and a number of political parties, and even encompasses criticism of one institution or another on occasion. But beyond that, what is the centre of attention is the country itself, Portugal as a whole. And what interests Portugal's partners \u2013 notably the eurozone countries, because it is ultimately they that will be taking the decisions \u2013 is whether or not Portugal has the will to abide by the commitments it has entered into, and the determination at national level to fulfil them. This is why I am once more appealing to Portugal's institutions and main political forces, particularly those that are linked in one way or another to the programme's implementation, to cooperate together to ensure success, and to avoid prolonging the sacrifices already being borne by the Portuguese people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5162eb6db5796d4b2d63db44\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-08T16:08:13.210Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Portugal faces an extra Troika visit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Portugal's lenders will be paying an early visit to Lisbon again following the constitutional court's decision to block pay and benefit cuts in this year's austerity budget.</p> <p>The last quarterly visit took place last month, so the Portuguese government could have been spared the delights of a Troika visit until June.

He noted that Spain\u2019s financing costs, in some cases, were better than they had been since 2010. \u201cThere will be economic growth in 2014.

It will certainly be a very difficult process,\" Pedro Passos Coelho said in a live broadcast on Sunday evening.</p> <p>He added that while he respected the court, its ruling would hamper government plans to take back control of its own finances from international lenders next year.</p> </blockquote> <p>The move came after Portugal's bailout programme was thrown into renewed uncertainty on Friday night, when its constitutional court dramatically blocked parts of its austerity budget.</p> <p>The judges ruled that planned cuts in public sector pay and state pensions were unconstitutional as they failed to share the burden fairly. That created a black hole in the country's fiscal plans, which Passos Coelho is now racing to fill.</p> <p>It's not clear how the education and health budgets will be hit. But the European Union has already warned Lisbon that it must stick to the terms of its \u20ac78bn bailout.</p> <p>In a statement last night, the EU said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any departure from the programme's objectives, or their re-negotiation, would in fact neutralise the efforts already made and achieved by the Portuguese citizens, namely the growing investor confidence in Portugal, and prolong the difficulties from the adjustment.</p> <p>The Commission therefore trusts that the Portuguese Government will swiftly identify the measures necessary to adapt the 2013 budget in a way that respects the revised fiscal target as requested by the Portuguese Government and supported by the Troika in the 7th review of the programme.</p> </blockquote> <p>Portugal is already deep in recession, with public anger growing over its austerity programme growing.</p> <p>The <strong>Wall Street Journal</strong> even reported last night that the government had considered paying public employees and pensioners one month of their income in Treasury bills, to get around the court ruling.</p> <p>This was later denied by officials, although the idea could perhaps be applied to those tasked with steering Europe through the crisis....</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/katie_martin_FX/status/321150265413742592\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>If all the eurocrats were paid in peripheral bonds, that could sharpen the mind.

    "webTitle": "Royal Mail dismisses claims of stamp price increase", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Mail has dismissed as \"pure speculation\" claims by campaigners that privatising the postal service will see the price of a first-class stamp rocket to nearly \u00a31 within three years. The Save Our Royal Mail campaign has warned that the price of first-class mail is set to increase because competing mail operators are likely to challenge Royal Mail's VAT-free status under European law. Last spring the Royal Mail raised the cost of a first-class stamp by 30%, its biggest price rise for 37 years, taking it from 46p to 60p. The move was seen as pushing the organisation closer to privatisation and raised fears over the impact on small businesses and elderly people. Royal Mail sparked accusations of \"profiteering\" when it capped the number of stamps shops could buy in before the price rises came into force. Save Our Royal Mail, which was set up by charities and pensioner groups to fight the likely sell-off, and is co-ordinated by the Communications Workers Union, said that if 20% VAT were added it would lift the price of a first-class stamp to 72p. If Royal Mail then raised the price a further 30% it would be 94p by 2015. Even if VAT was not applied the campaigners said the price for consumers sending a first-class letter \u2013 which is not capped by the regulator Ofcom \u2013 \"would likely hit a pound in three/four years, assuming two increases within that period\". Under the new pricing regime also set out last year, first-class prices will no longer be set by Ofcom, although for second-class it introduced a seven-year price cap of 55p, index-linked to the consumer price index rate of inflation. Mish Tullar, Royal Mail spokesman, said the campaigners' key claims were based on \"pure speculation\" and a misunderstanding of the current regulatory regime. He said: \"Stamp prices, whether set under public or private ownership, are subject to significant competitive pressures. \"Customers have many alternatives to the post and there are now many postal providers. It is pure speculation to suggest that stamp prices could reach \u00a31 in the next few years \u2013 in fact, in 2013 there was no increase in the price of first-class or second-class stamps.\" He insisted that UK stamp prices \"are among the best value in the EU. In five of the six weight steps for first-class and second-class mail, the cost of UK stamps are ranked in the bottom half of prices when compared with other European countries. In some cases, the UK is the cheapest.\" VAT exemption was a matter for HMRC, he said, but was currently safeguarded: \"VAT exemptions for core postal service delivery products such as stamps, by universal service providers (USP), are in place in the vast majority of EU countries under the European VAT Directive. Under the Postal Services Act 2011, Royal Mail is the USP in the UK. The VAT exemption would apply regardless of whether Royal Mail was in public or private ownership. Similar VAT exemptions are in place for universal service products in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. In each country the USP is privately owned.\" The warning from Save Our Royal Mail came as it launched a new website and an online petition to 'Stop the \u00a31 stamp and protect our postal services'. It said: \"Not everything in life should be defined by its monetary value. Royal Mail is part of the fabric of the nation \u2013 we don't want to see it ripped apart. If the Royal Mail is sold off at affordable prices, rural services and free postal services for our service men and women as well as vulnerable groups will disappear. The aim of our campaign is to persuade politicians that they must act now and guarantee that these vital services do not disappear. A spokesman for the Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills said: \"Royal Mail will continue to be the designated universal service provider regardless of its ownership. An ownership change would not, therefore, trigger a change in the current VAT exemption which applies to first- and second-class stamps as part of the one price, anywhere service.\"",

      "body": "<p>Royal Mail has dismissed as \"pure speculation\" claims by campaigners that privatising the postal service will see the price of a first-class stamp rocket to nearly \u00a31 within three years.</p> <p>The Save Our Royal Mail campaign has warned that the price of first-class mail is set to increase because competing mail operators are likely to challenge Royal Mail's VAT-free status under European law.</p> <p>Last spring the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/27/cost-stamp-rises-royal-mail-price\" title=\"\">Royal Mail raised the cost of a first-class stamp</a> by 30%, its biggest price rise for 37 years, taking it from 46p to 60p. The move was seen as pushing the organisation closer to privatisation and raised fears over the impact on small businesses and elderly people. Royal Mail sparked accusations of \"profiteering\" when it capped the number of stamps shops could buy in before the price rises came into force.</p> <p>Save Our Royal Mail, which was set up by charities and pensioner groups to fight the likely sell-off, and is co-ordinated by the Communications Workers Union, said that if 20% VAT were added it would lift the price of a first-class stamp to 72p. If Royal Mail then raised the price a further 30% it would be 94p by 2015. Even if VAT was not applied the campaigners said the price for consumers sending a first-class letter \u2013 which is not capped by the regulator Ofcom \u2013 \"would likely hit a pound in three/four years, assuming two increases within that period\".</p> <p>Under the new pricing regime also set out last year, first-class prices will no longer be set by Ofcom, although for second-class it introduced a seven-year price cap of 55p, index-linked to the consumer price index rate of inflation.</p> <p>Mish Tullar, Royal Mail spokesman, said the campaigners' key claims were based on \"pure speculation\" and a misunderstanding of the current regulatory regime. He said: \"Stamp prices, whether set under public or private ownership, are subject to significant competitive pressures.</p> <p>\"Customers have many alternatives to the post and there are now many postal providers. It is pure speculation to suggest that stamp prices could reach \u00a31 in the next few years \u2013 in fact, in 2013 there was no increase in the price of first-class or second-class stamps.\"</p> <p>He insisted that UK stamp prices \"are among the best value in the EU. In five of the six weight steps for first-class and second-class mail, the cost of UK stamps are ranked in the bottom half of prices when compared with other European countries. In some cases, the UK is the cheapest.\"</p> <p>VAT exemption was a matter for HMRC, he said, but was currently safeguarded: \"VAT exemptions for core postal service delivery products such as stamps, by universal service providers (USP), are in place in the vast majority of EU countries under the European VAT Directive. Under the Postal Services Act 2011, Royal Mail is the USP in the UK. The VAT exemption would apply regardless of whether Royal Mail was in public or private ownership. Similar VAT exemptions are in place for universal service products in Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. In each country the USP is privately owned.\"</p> <p>The warning from Save Our Royal Mail came as it <a href=\"http://www.change.org/en-GB/petitions/uk-government-stop-the-1-stamp-and-protect-our-postal-services\" title=\"\">launched a new website</a> and an online petition to 'Stop the \u00a31 stamp and protect our postal services'. It said: \"Not everything in life should be defined by its monetary value. Royal Mail is part of the fabric of the nation \u2013 we don't want to see it ripped apart. If the Royal Mail is sold off at affordable prices, rural services and free postal services for our service men and women as well as vulnerable groups will disappear. The aim of our campaign is to persuade politicians that they must act now and guarantee that these vital services do not disappear.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills said: \"Royal Mail will continue to be the designated universal service provider regardless of its ownership. An ownership change would not, therefore, trigger a change in the current VAT exemption which applies to first- and second-class stamps as part of the one price, anywhere service.\"</p>",
