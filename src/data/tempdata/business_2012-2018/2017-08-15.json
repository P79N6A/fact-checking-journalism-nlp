      "bodyText": "Adani\u2019s proposed Carmichael coalmine in Queensland would be the largest Australia has ever seen and the federal and state governments are keen to offer it financial support. What will the extent of the project be? Adani has said that over a 60-year lifetime, the company expects to extract 2.3bn tonnes of coal, which would make it equivalent to the biggest mine in the US. It is proposed to have six open-cut pits as well as five underground mines, with a disturbance area more than 30km long. The company initially obtained approval to remove 60m tonnes of coal each year, but has scaled back its ambition to an initial production rate of 25m tonnes a year. But building the mine would have a much wider indirect effect. Carmichael would be the first mine in the giant untapped Galilee coal basin. The infrastructure that would be built to allow extraction of coal from the Carmichael mine could serve at least 10 more. If all the mines mooted for the basin were built and reached their proposed maximum output at the same time, they would be producing 330m tonnes of coal a year \u2013 more than Australia\u2019s entire coal industry does now. Industry consultant Wood Mackenzie has estimated that about half that might actually be extracted in any one year. The government\u2019s Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund is considering an A$900m subsidised loan and Matt Canavan, who was responsible for that fund until stepping aside as resources minister last month, has repeatedly stated his strong support for the project. The Queensland state government has made a deal with Adani, offering it a break on its royalty payments for the coal it extracts \u2013 but the details are secret. Why are people so opposed to it? A wide range of groups are opposed to the project for different reasons. Climate: If the mine does extract all the coal Adani says it plans to, the average emissions from burning that coal will amount to about 77m tonnes of CO2 each year. And if the mine reaches its touted peak production rate of 60m tonnes a year, it will be responsible for more than 120m tonnes of CO2 emissions in those years \u2013 more than the annual emissions of many countries. If the mine goes ahead and that leads to the development of other mines in the basin, their potential combined maximum output would result in more than 705m tonnes of CO2 being emitted each year. That\u2019s about 1.3 times Australia\u2019s total current emissions. If even half that were produced it would result in emissions larger than those of most nations. If the world wants to have a 50% chance of keeping global warming at less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, 88% of the world\u2019s known coal reserves need to stay in the ground. In the Asia-Pacific region, more than 90% of coal needs to stay in the ground, according to research published in Nature. Coal burned in other countries is not counted in Australia\u2019s emissions \u2013 coal from Carmichael would be exported to India \u2013 but many scientists and commentators have pointed out that producing those emissions runs counter to Australia\u2019s commitment in the Paris climate agreement to work to keep global warming at \u201cwell below\u201d 2C. Water: Among the most pressing environmental concerns with the Carmichael mine, aside from climate change, is its reliance on water, a precious resource in Australia. Coal mining uses a lot of water for everything from cooling cutting equipment in underground mines through to transporting coal as a slurry in pipelines. About 250 litres of freshwater is used for each tonne of coal produced. In April the Queensland government granted Adani a highly unusual water licence to extract unlimited amounts from a water body that feeds into the underground Great Artesian Basin. Adani itself has estimated it will use 12bn litres of water a year \u2013 or 13 Olympic swimming pools a day. The licence acknowledges this will \u201chave an impact on the underground water levels in the region of the mine\u201d both during and after the mine\u2019s planned years of operation. As that water level drops, farmers\u2019 bores could run dry and unique ecological communities in the region that rely on the natural springs may be destroyed. Environmentalists and farmers have complained that there are no \u201ctrigger thresholds\u201d that will force mining to stop if Carmichael uses too much water. Impacts on the Great Barrier Reef: Environmental groups have worked hard to link the development of the Carmichael mine to the destruction of the reef. Over the past two years, half the coral on the reef has been killed in bleaching events caused by rising water temperatures, mostly a result of climate change. Scientists have said that for coral reefs to have any chance of a future, global warming must be stopped at 1.5C. Even if that could be achieved, coral reefs would be severely degraded. So to the extent that coal from the mine contributes to global warming, it is a threat to the reef. But the mine will also have a more direct impact, since the coal will be exported to India via a shipping terminal on the Queensland coast at Abbot Point, opposite the reef, increasing the risks of collisions, spills and excessive coal dust harming corals. The terminal will be expanded to accommodate coal from the Carmichael mine, which will involve dredging. This is notoriously problematic for surrounding coral, since it stirs up sediment, which degrades water quality and starves coral of sunlight. Adani\u2019s reputation: A report by Environmental Justice Australia detailed a long list of allegations of environmental damage caused by Adani Enterprises and its subsidiaries around the world. And a more recent report by the same group detailed evidence in support of allegations of illegal business dealings, which EJA says points to involvement in large-scale illegal mineral exports and violations of Indian environmental laws that harmed the environment and communities. What is the support for the mine based on? The most common reason given by Australian politicians for supporting the Carmichael mine is jobs \u2013 but other arguments are raised in support of it too. Jobs: Queensland\u2019s unemployment rate is at 6.4%, and higher in some regional areas. So 10,000 jobs, as Adani, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and others have said the project will provide, are a strong motivation to support the project. But that \u201c10,000 jobs\u201d figure is pulled from Adani\u2019s publicity material, and is contradicted by testimony in a Queensland court, given by consultants for Adani. Jerome Fahrer from ACIL Allen Consulting submitted an analysis on behalf of Adani estimating the project would create just 1,464 jobs. And that figure is an estimate over the lifetime of the project, assuming it reaches maximum capacity, extracting 60m tonnes of coal a year. But according to Wood Mackenzie, the jobs in Queensland would come at the expense of mining jobs elsewhere. In a report for the Infrastructure Fund, which has coal investments in the neighbouring state of New South Wales, it found coal-producing basins in NSW and southern Queensland would cut their production by more than a third, due to a drop in coal prices, if Carmichael opened. It also found 10 new projects that would otherwise go ahead in NSW would no longer be profitable. Alleviating poverty: Australian ministers have argued that coal from Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine will help lift people in India out of poverty, since it will be used to generate electricity in a country where many people have no access to power. Australia\u2019s minister for the environment and energy, Josh Frydenberg, has said the mine will help \u201clift hundreds of millions of people out of energy poverty, not just in India but right across the world\u201d. It is true that about 75m rural households and 6m urban households in India have no power. But burning more coal won\u2019t help the vast majority of those people, since they don\u2019t have a connection to the electricity grid. Access to the grid is too expensive for most of those people, making off-grid renewable generation a much more realistic option for alleviating energy poverty. The Indian government is aware of this, with plans to stop importing coal altogether. And its energy policies have been driving the cost of solar to record lows.",

      "bodyText": "Rail commuters facing a steep 3.6% increase in ticket prices might find it tough to accept but there is light at the end of the tunnel for UK inflation. Rising prices have been one of the big economic stories of the past 12 months, but for the past two months the financial markets have been surprised by the weakness of cost-of-living pressures. The reason for that is simple: the two factors that have been driving inflation higher since the summer of 2016 \u2013 higher global oil prices and the sharp fall in the value of sterling after the EU referendum \u2013 have almost washed through the system. A quick look at the Office for National Statistics data for producer prices helps explain what has been going on. Producer prices are a measure of inflation early in the supply chain, since they gauge both the cost to firms of buying in fuel and raw material, and the prices of goods as they leave factory gates. Fuel and raw material prices rose fast in the second half of 2016, with the annual rate of increase peaking at 19.9% in January. Since then, though, it has fallen month after month, dropping from 10% in June to 6.5% in July. Factory gate prices showed a similar, although less dramatic profile. They were rising at an annual rate of 3.7% in February and March, but have now slipped back to 3.2%. As Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, put it: \u201cWhile there is still some residual impact of sterling devaluation to feed through, with underlying inflationary pressures low, we think that consumer price inflation is close to topping out for the immediate future.\u201d It\u2019s not all good news, of course. There is probably still in the pipeline some residual inflationary pressure caused by sterling\u2019s fall which will show up in the coming months. The Bank of England expects consumer price inflation to reach 3% later in the year. What\u2019s more, despite the better-than-expected inflation data in the past two months, prices are still rising faster than wages. The squeeze on living standards will continue for a while yet, even though the pressure on real incomes will not be quite so pronounced. But with the economy moving at the pace of a slow-moving commuter train, the prospect of inflation rising to well over 3% now looks remote.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "China\u2019s credit-fuelled economic strategy has been branded as dangerous by the International Monetary Fund in a strongly-worded statement warning that its approach risks financial turmoil. The IMF used its annual health check on the world\u2019s second biggest economy to stress that faster expansion in 2017 was coming at the cost of a jump in private sector debt and an increasing use of complex financial instruments. While the IMF increased its forecast for Chinese expansion in 2017 from 6.2% to 6.7%, it stressed that this was the result of the authorities in Beijing putting a higher priority on hitting a growth target than on the quality of the economic output. The Chinese government has pledged to double the size of the economy between 2010 and 2020 and has been prepared to see non-financial sector debt rise rapidly in order to achieve its aim. Total debt has quadrupled since the financial crisis to stand at $28tn (\u00a322tn) at the end of last year. The IMF said debt as a proportion of gross domestic product would rise from 235% to almost 300% by 2022. Previously, the Washington-based IMF \u2013 which publishes annual reports on its member countries \u2013 had said debt would peak at 270% of GDP. \u201cInternational experience suggests that China\u2019s credit growth is on a dangerous trajectory, with increasing risks of a disruptive adjustment and/or a marked growth slowdown,\u201d the IMF said. With many of the advanced economies of the west struggling in the years since the financial crisis of 2007-09, China has acted as the growth engine of the global economy, accounting for more than half the increase in world GDP in recent years. But the IMF expressed concern at the methods used to keep the economy expanding rapidly \u2013 an increase in government spending to fund infrastructure programmes and a willingness to allow state-controlled banks to lend more for speculative property developments. It said the buildup of public and private debt would limit the ability of Beijing to act in the event of a financial crisis. In its report, the IMF noted that debt was becoming less effective as a means of stimulating activity, noting that China needed three times as much credit in 2016 to achieve the same amount of growth as in 2008. \u201cSince 2008, private sector debt relative to GDP has risen by 80 percentage points to about 175% \u2013 such large increases have internationally been associated with sharp growth slowdowns and often financial crises\u201d, the IMF said. It added that growth in the five years between 2012 and 2016 would have averaged 5.5% rather than 7.25% had credit growth been kept to a sustainable rate. The fund said it now expected China to expand at an average rate of 6.4% over the next three years. \u201cThe near-term growth outlook has firmed but at the cost of higher medium-term risks. Policy support, recovering external demand, and reform progress have helped keep growth strong. Amid strong momentum and an expectation that the authorities will do what it takes to achieve their medium-term growth target, staff have increased their medium-term baseline growth projections,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cHowever, risks around this baseline have also increased. The main cost of this stronger growth outlook is further large increases in public and private debt. Such large increases have internationally been associated with sharp growth slowdowns and often financial crises. Staff thus recommends replacing precise numerical growth targets with a commitment to reforms that deliver the fastest sustainable growth path.\u201d The IMF also highlighted its worries about the rapid growth of China\u2019s banking sector, now one of the largest in the world. \u201cChina now has one of the largest banking sectors in the world. At 310% GDP, China\u2019s banking sector is above the advanced economy average and nearly three times the emerging market average. \u201cThe sharp growth in recent years reflects both a rise in credit to the real economy and intra-financial sector claims. The increase in size, complexity and interconnectedness of these exposures have resulted in sharply rising risks.\u201d Beijing rejected the IMF\u2019s criticisms, saying that the stronger growth outlook for 2017 was the result of a rebalancing of the economy and the government\u2019s reform programme rather than a reliance on debt.",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s nothing like the failure of a competitor to perk up other airline\u2019s share prices. Sure enough, as Air Berlin filed for insolvency on Tuesday, almost every other European airline gained altitude. EasyJet\u2019s shares were up 4.5%, Ryanair\u2019s by 3.3%, British Airways owner IAG\u2019s by 2.9%, and even little Wizz Air improved 4.6%. The reaction makes sense. Air Berlin has been loss-making for years but it is still a top 10 European airline, measured by numbers of passengers, and thus has been able to irritate rivals by merely surviving. That is why one reason why low-cost winners, such as easyJet and Ryanair, grumble about irrational economics and the current state of overcapacity in the market. In a business like aviation, it is rarely safe to assume any airline\u2019s financial crisis is terminal. But Air Berlin\u2019s troubles, like those at Alitalia (now in administration), do look destined to lead a major restructuring of some form. Credit lines from the German government are only a temporary measure. The harder fact is that Etihad, a big shareholder in both Air Berlin and Alitalia, seems to have abandoned its strange strategy of throwing millions of euros at loss-making investments. Should either easyJet or Ryanair exploit a once-in-a-generation opportunity to pick up the pieces, buy Air Berlin and bag a big slice of the German market? Ryanair has spoken about wanting a 20% share there eventually and easyJet has been expanding too. Both should tread carefully. The prize assets are slots at big German airports. If they become available on a clean basis, then fine. But restructuring a loss-making airline of the size of Air Berlin could be a messy business. Yet Ryanair has certainly got the right idea in demanding that state-aid rules are followed. The Irish carrier smells \u201can obvious conspiracy\u201d to deliver Air Berlin on a debt-free basis to national flag-carrier Lufthansa. A stitch-up would indeed be outrageous. It is worth making a fuss at Brussels \u2013 just don\u2019t get mugged into overpaying as an alternative. Fund managers shouldn\u2019t get too pumped up over pay pressure The City\u2019s fund managers would like you to know they are not a bunch of supine lickspittles on the troubled issue of executive pay. On the contrary, says Chris Cummings, chief executive of trade body the Investment Association, 2017\u2019s round of annual meetings shows shareholders \u201care flexing their muscles and holding big business to account\u201d. Really? This claim seems to rest on \u201cdissent\u201d being defined as a vote of 20% or more against a company\u2019s pay resolution. True, such a level can be noteworthy in a field where Soviet-style majorities are commonplace. But would you really describe a 20% vote as a muscular show of force? If you score a fifth of goals in a football match, you\u2019ve lost. The association\u2019s curious yardstick is also capable of generating flattering conclusions whatever the reading. When the number of \u201crebellions\u201d falls, as at FTSE 100 companies, it means \u201ccompanies have listened\u201d. But when the figure increases, as at FTSE 250 firms, we\u2019re told it doesn\u2019t mean the board has closed its ears; rather, it shows the companies are \u201cin the investor spotlight\u201d. To be fair to the association, its work behind the scenes almost certainly contributed to six FTSE 350 companies withdrawing contentious pay proposals last year instead of risking a defeat. That is a significant figure. The association is also plainly on the side of reform. It has backed the mandatory publication of pay ratios and wants boardroom pay to be simpler. Jolly good, but before boasting about its members\u2019 toughness, the association needs to look outside the window. FTSE 100 chief executives took a collective 17% pay cut to \u201conly\u201d \u00a34.5m last year but, to most observers, the big new factor was the government\u2019s threat to introduce pay ratios, workers on pay committees and annual binding votes. Those ideas probably persuaded a few pay committees to tone things down, at least temporarily. Yes, greater fund manager pressure may have helped at the margin, but, please, don\u2019t tell us shareholder activism is winning. If it were that easy, the government wouldn\u2019t be contemplating reform after so many years of dancing around the subject. Government still on the wrong track over rail fares Annoyed that rail fares will go up by 3.6%? So you should be. Linking the annual increase to July\u2019s retail prices index, which consistently gives higher readings than the consumer prices index, makes no sense. The Bank of England uses CPI for inflation-targeting. CPI is used for calculating annual increases to benefits. And CPI forms one part of the triple-lock on pensions. By rights, RPI should be history. To quote the Office for National Statistics: \u201cWe know there will be a focus on the RPI this month, but the national statistician has been clear it is not a good measure and we do not recommend its use.\u201d The ONS trots out the same line every August. It\u2019s time ministers noticed.",

When the number of \u201crebellions\u201d falls, as at FTSE 100 companies, it means \u201ccompanies have listened\u201d. But when the figure increases, as at FTSE 250 firms, we\u2019re told it doesn\u2019t mean the board has closed its ears; rather, it shows the companies are \u201cin the investor spotlight\u201d.</p> <p>To be fair to the association, its work behind the scenes almost certainly contributed to six FTSE 350 companies withdrawing contentious pay proposals last year instead of risking a defeat. That is a significant figure. The association is also plainly on the side of reform. It has backed the mandatory publication of pay ratios and wants boardroom pay to be simpler.</p> <p>Jolly good, but before boasting about its members\u2019 toughness, the association needs to look outside the window. FTSE 100 chief executives took a collective 17% pay cut to \u201conly\u201d \u00a34.5m last year but, to most observers, the big new factor was the government\u2019s threat to introduce pay ratios, workers on pay committees and annual binding votes. Those ideas probably persuaded a few pay committees to tone things down, at least temporarily.</p> <p>Yes, greater fund manager pressure may have helped at the margin, but, please, don\u2019t tell us shareholder activism is winning. If it were that easy, the government wouldn\u2019t be contemplating reform after so many years of dancing around the subject.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1de5ed6c66b47ce2eebb27164a024cd7cce45310\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1de5ed6c66b47ce2eebb27164a024cd7cce45310/0_274_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two people use a train ticket machine at a railway station in Derbyshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two people use a train ticket machine at a railway station in Derbyshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Government still on the wrong track over rail fares</h2> <p>Annoyed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/15/commuters-brace-for-steepest-fare-rise-in-five-years-as-uk-inflation-rises-to-36\">rail fares will go up by 3.6%</a>? So you should be. Linking the annual increase to July\u2019s retail prices index, which consistently gives higher readings than the consumer prices index, makes no sense. The Bank of England uses CPI for inflation-targeting. CPI is used for calculating annual increases to benefits. And CPI forms one part of the triple-lock on pensions. By rights, RPI should be history.</p> <p>To quote the Office for National Statistics: \u201cWe know there will be a focus on the RPI this month, but the national statistician has been clear it is not a good measure and we do not recommend its use.\u201d The ONS trots out the same line every August.

      "bodyText": "French pilots have claimed easyJet is risking passenger and crew safety by scheduling too many flights. Captains are being pressed into flying more hours than they are legally allowed and face intimidation if they refuse, France\u2019s pilots\u2019 union said. In an open letter to the company\u2019s main shareholder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the union said the flight schedule is unrealistic and had caused numerous delays and last-minute cancellations. \u201cA red line has been crossed and we are very shocked,\u201d said Arnaud Wiplier, the president of the easyJet section of the Syndicat National des Pilotes de Ligne (SNPL). \u201cThe airline has eyes bigger than its stomach; the schedules are not possible.\u201d Wiplier told Le Figaro newspaper that easyJet had scheduled far too many flights during the summer, especially at weekends, when the chances of cancellation are eight times higher. \u201cSummer is very busy and it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a plane has to do six flights a day, the last flight will have a long delay or be cancelled.\u201d EasyJet, which carries about 17 million passengers a year in France, categorically rejected the pilots\u2019 criticism and said it was \u201csurprised by their action\u201d. The airline said it made no compromises on safety and was structured to manage a normal level of disruption in high season. A spokesman for easyJet said the dispute had been resolved after talks. \u201cWe have resolved the issues with the SNPL pilot union in France and we will continue to work closely with them,\u201d he said. In a statement issued on Tuesday evening, Nicolas Frick, the vice-president of the SNPL union for easyJet, said progress had been made. \u201cSNPL and easyJet have reached a temporary resolution to the issues raised by the union last week and we are meeting later this week to continue our dialogue. Until that meeting, we will not comment further,\u201d he said. The open letter, dated 11 August, said Haji-Ioannou had \u201cmade each employee feel cared for and respected\u201d, but now \u201ccommercial teams are selling a schedule that the flight operators don\u2019t have the means to carry out because of numerous cost-cutting measures\u201d. It also complained of daily flight cancellations and ground staff who did not \u201cknow what to say to passengers or even [how to] find them a hotel room\u201d. The union added: \u201cThe crew are also pushed to their limits every day, limits that have become objectives. We now ask our flight captains to use their discretion in order to overrun the legal limits on flight times. \u201cCertain flight captains who refuse, as is their right \u2026 are even summoned by the management to Luton to be intimidated. These are unbelievable practices.\u201d The pilots claim the pressure on them is caused by new European rules giving passengers \u201clots of money for delays and cancellations\u201d. Long delays have caused passenger anger in recent weeks. Last month, after a 13-hour wait for an easyJet flight, a Nice airport worker apparently hit a passenger who was holding a baby. EasyJet has launched a recruitment drive for an additional 450 pilots, from cadets to experienced captains from other airlines. The carrier employs more than 3,000 pilots to fly its Airbus aircraft on more than 870 routes in 31 countries. The summer is a critical season for airlines, whose operations are typically loss-making for much of the rest of the year. British unions warned this month that pilots were being pushed to the limit by demanding summer schedules. The number of flights to or from the UK reached record levels in late July. The British Airline Pilots Association said an inadequate number of pilots at some airlines could contribute to dangerous levels of fatigue, with increasing numbers reporting burnout from inadequate rest and unworkable rotas.",

    "webTitle": "Pound falls against dollar as inflation comes in lower than expected", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sterling fell against the dollar on Tuesday after the CPI rate of inflation remained unchanged in July, reducing pressure on the Bank of England to increase interest rates to curb the rising cost of living. The pound shed more than a cent to reach $1.2855 on the foreign exchange markets, after the consumer prices index held steady at 2.6% last month, the same level as recorded in June. City economists had expected a slight rise to 2.7% on the back of higher costs for producers following the slump in sterling in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union, which has led to rising inflation this year. The unchanged growth in prices weakens the case for a rate hike by the Bank of England, even through inflation remains above Threadneedle Street\u2019s 2% target. The BoE is next due to make a decision on interest rates next month, after more than a decade without an increase in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The latest CPI figures published on Tuesday could indicate inflation is getting close to its peak, according to economists, after the second unexpectedly lower number for the benchmark rate in the space of two months. Even so, the BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee had said earlier this month it expected CPI to climb to about 3% in October before gradually retreating. \u201cAlthough we expect CPI inflation to rise a bit further over the months ahead, the end of inflation\u2019s ascent now looks in sight,\u201d said Victoria Clarke, of Investec. She said the question now turned to whether inflation would outstrip the BoE\u2019s 2% target by more than 1%, a level that would require the governor, Mark Carney, to write an open letter to the chancellor to explain why. Inflationary pressures were visible across a number of import-intensive goods including food, clothing and furniture last month, according to the data from the Office for National Statistics. The rate of CPI was curbed by weaker energy price inflation, amid falling fuel prices. There was a fall in the producer prices index, which shows inflation at the early stages of the pipeline before reaching consumers, meaning that the rise in firms\u2019 cost pressures eased in July. The data release came at the same time as July\u2019s retail price index measure of inflation showed an increase to 3.6%, a typically higher measure of prices than CPI which will be used to calculate the steepest annual increase in rail fares in the past five years for commuters in England and Wales. The July inflation data is significant because it shows higher costs for consumers outstripping expected growth in pay, which the BoE has said could be hindered by uncertainty over Brexit harming companies\u2019 willingness to raise wages. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and recruitment firm Adecco said on Tuesday that basic pay over the next 12 months was expected to rise by just 1%, well below the pace of inflation, even amid low levels of unemployment. \u201cAlthough inflation is likely to start falling next year, we understand some families are concerned today about the cost of living,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Treasury.",

City economists had expected a slight rise to 2.7% on the back of higher costs for producers following the slump in sterling in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union, which has led to rising inflation this year. </p> \n<p>The unchanged growth in prices weakens the case for a rate hike by the Bank of England, even through inflation remains above Threadneedle Street\u2019s 2% target.

The rate of CPI was curbed by weaker energy price inflation, amid falling fuel prices.</p> \n<p>There was a fall in the producer prices index, which shows inflation at the early stages of the pipeline before reaching consumers, meaning that the rise in firms\u2019 cost pressures eased in July. </p> \n<p>The data release came at the same time as July\u2019s retail price index measure of inflation showed an increase to 3.6%, a typically higher measure of prices than CPI which will be used to calculate the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/15/commuters-brace-for-steepest-fare-rise-in-five-years-as-uk-inflation-rises-to-36\">steepest annual increase in rail fares in the past five years</a> for commuters in England and Wales. </p> \n<p>The July inflation data is significant because it shows higher costs for consumers outstripping expected growth in pay, which the BoE has said could be hindered by uncertainty over Brexit harming companies\u2019 willingness to raise wages. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and recruitment firm Adecco said on Tuesday that basic pay over the next 12 months was expected to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/about/media/press/140817-lmo-summer17\">rise by just 1%</a>, well below the pace of inflation, even amid low levels of unemployment. </p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough inflation is likely to start falling next year, we understand some families are concerned today about the cost of living,\u201d said a spokesperson for the Treasury. </p>",

The German government has provided an emergency \u20ac150m (\u00a3137m) loan to Air Berlin to enable it to keep flying its schedules. Air Berlin is the second largest airline in Germany, but has struggled financially for years. It was propped up by its main shareholder, Etihad, but the Gulf airline announced it was no longer willing to invest. Lufthansa is in talks and would be well placed to take over most of its ailing competitor \u2013 prompting criticism from rival Ryanair. EasyJet would be keen to acquire slots to boost its small presence in Germany, where Lufthansa dominates. However, it is unlikely to countenance a full takeover: Air Berlin operates a large Airbus fleet similar to easyJet\u2019s but also has more than 100 Boeing planes, as well as high costs and pension liabilities. An easyJet spokesman said it would not comment on speculation. Air Berlin made losses of \u20ac782m in 2016. Etihad, which owns almost 30% of Air Berlin, said the developments were \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d but it could not keep injecting cash, after investing an additional \u20ac250m in April. An Etihad spokesman said: \u201cAir Berlin\u2019s business has deteriorated at an unprecedented pace, preventing it from overcoming its significant challenges and from implementing alternative strategic solutions. Under these circumstances, as a minority shareholder, Etihad cannot offer funding that would further increase our financial exposure.\u201d The Gulf airline had also invested heavily in the perennially loss-making Alitalia before deciding to stem the cashflow earlier this year, pushing the Italian carrier similarly into administration. The German government, like Italy\u2019s before it with Alitalia, is now helping to find a solution to protect jobs. Ryanair, which has bid for Alitalia, is not believed to be seeking any part of Air Berlin. The Irish airline lodged a competition complaint on Tuesday with German authorities and the European commission over what it claimed was \u201cthe obvious conspiracy\u201d between the German government, Lufthansa and Air Berlin to carve up Air Berlin\u2019s assets, excluding competitors and ignoring EU competition and state aid rules. A Ryanair spokesman said: \u201cThis is clearly being set up for Lufthansa to take over Air Berlin, which will be in breach of all known German and EU competition rules. Now even the German government is supporting this Lufthansa-led deal with \u20ac150m of state aid. German customers and visitors will suffer higher air fares to pay for this Lufthansa monopoly.\u201d Analysts said a Lufthansa takeover would indeed mainly be to thwart the likes of Ryanair. Damian Brewer, of RBS, said: \u201cFor Lufthansa we see any moves as defensive \u2013 blocking other more competitive airlines from expanding. If acquired, Air Berlin\u2019s D\u00fcsseldorf airport slots would likely be a valuable asset to Lufthansa while freezing new entrants out of the \u2018full\u2019 airport, unless the German authorities require slots to be surrendered to new entrants.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland is preparing to cut nearly 900 IT jobs, union officials have warned, as the bailed-out bank continues to trim costs in its battle to regain profitability. Officials at the Unite union said 880 posts were at risk, with RBS planning to lose 40% of permanent IT staff in London and 65% of contractors by 2020. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, said: \u201cRBS\u2019s fixation with cutting employee numbers, restructuring and offshoring work that could reasonably be done by displaced staff within the RBS IT community is unacceptable. This British-taxpayer funded bank should be concentrating on investing in jobs here in the UK, rather than wholesale cuts.\u201d RBS said it had not consulted on staff numbers with unions but had shared \u201ca direction of travel\u201d about the IT operations. \u201cOur proposed plans are designed to reduce the number of contractors we employ and strengthen our permanent workforce and while we are downsizing in London we are reinvesting in other UK hubs,\u201d a spokesperson for the bank said. \u201cInevitably as RBS becomes a simpler, smaller bank focused on the UK and Ireland, our technology function will undergo reorganisation and will reduce over time,\u201d the spokesperson added. The bank has been plagued by IT problems in the past, notably in June 2012 when 6.5 million customers were locked out their accounts for days. The company, which owns NatWest and Ulster Bank, was fined \u00a356m in 2014 by financial regulators for the outage. The bank\u2019s interim results this month showed the scale of job cuts already undertaken. Over the past 12 months, some 14,200 roles were lost, taking the workforce to 75,000. A decade ago, before its near-collapse, RBS employed more than 200,000 people around the globe. Ross McEwan, the chief executive who is focusing the operation on the UK and Ireland, has conceded that more jobs are at risk as he attempts to return RBS to profitability for the first time since its taxpayer bailout in 2008. MacGregor said: \u201cThe decade of slashing jobs has done nothing to boost morale, increase consumer confidence or improve the bank\u2019s performance. By 2020 just a fraction of the RBS IT function will remain, leaving this organisation operating a skeleton service with the customers and remaining staff paying the price.\u201d In June, it emerged that 443 RBS jobs were being cut in the UK and being moved to India, where Unite has calculated the bank employs 12,500. Jobs are also being lost in branches. In March, 158 branches \u2013 largely NatWest \u2013 were earmarked for closure as customers switched to digital channels. The bank is on track to report 10 consecutive years of annual losses when it publishes its results for 2017 next February, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has conceded that the taxpayer stake will probably be sold at a loss. The shares are trading at around 265p \u2013 compared with 502p that was paid on average during the bailouts in 2008 and 2009, when \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds were used. Hammond\u2019s predecessor, George Osborne, sold off a 5% stake in 2015 at 330p a share \u2013 a \u00a31bn loss.",

    "webTitle": "UK CPI inflation unexpectedly holds steady at 2.6% in July - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "After a quiet day for economic news on Monday, investors have had more to get their teeth into today. The UK inflation data defied forecasts, with the consumer price index remaining steady at 2.6% in July, compared to expectations of an increase to 2.7%. Falling motor fuel prices were offset by higher prices for clothes, utilities and food. But the retail price index came in at 3.6%, higher than the forecast 3.5%. That means a hefty price rise is on the cards for rail travellers. The lower than expected CPI figure led most analysts to suggest a UK interest rate rise was not imminent, which helped send the pound lower. Elsewhere Germany\u2019s economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, but this was slightly below expectations. And US retail sales were stronger than expected in July, rising 0.6% compared to forecasts of an increase of around 0.4%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The strengthening dollar following the US retail sales numbers has accelerated the decline in the pound. Sterling is now down 0.9% at $1.2848. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: A rebound in retail sales in the US in July has triggered further gains in the US dollar on Tuesday, sending the greenback to its highest level in almost three weeks. Retail sales have been very underwhelming this year which has contributed to the view that the economy isn\u2019t ready for another rate hike this year. The dollar was already relatively well bid heading into the release on the back of some hawkish comments from William Dudley on Monday and today\u2019s release is doing that no harm. Not only did the July numbers comfortably beat expectations but the June numbers were also revised higher, providing an additional boost for dollar bulls. While today\u2019s report will likely increase the chances of another rate hike this year, it is still far from being priced in by the markets. The general trend of retail sales still remains worrying, despite the improvement over the last couple of months and 2% inflation still looks a pipe dream. That said, the dollar has been so heavily sold over the course of the year that even a slight unwinding of these trades could provide a near-term boost to the greenback. The dollar index has recently been languishing at levels seen only half a dozen times or so since the start of 2015 but not yet breached. With that in mind, it may take relatively little at the moment to get such a reaction in the dollar. The strong US retail sales could portend a good third quarter economic performance, and a December rate rise from the Federal Reserve. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: US retail sales figures for July are very good, rising 0.6% month on month in July versus the consensus 0.3% forecast. There were also big upward revisions from -0.2% month on month to +0.3% month on month for June. There were broad based gains with 10 of the 13 broad retail categories reporting rising sales. This suggests the household sector is strong and in our view bodes well for a 3% GDP figure for third quarter 2017 growth. With consumer confidence at firm levels, employment continuing to rise and wages showing some evidence of picking up we remain optimistic on the prospects for consumer spending. The details of the report show that gasoline sales were a drag (-0.4%) due to lower prices and with this category excluded sales were up 0.7%. There were strong performances from motor vehicles and building materials (both up 1.2%) with internet, department stores and miscellaneous stores also performing strongly. The only areas of disappointment were electronics (-0.5%) and clothing (-0.3%). Markets continue to focus on current low inflation rates, but with the labour market tightening and the growth story looking ok the prevailing view within the Fed is likely to remain that low inflation is merely \u201ctransient\u201d. We think inflation will be back at the 2% target by the end of the year and also predict a December Fed rate hike. We continue to expect two more 25bp hikes next year. At the sam time as the US retail sales, there has been more positive data, with the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire State business conditions jumping from 9.8 in July to 25.2 in August. This is better than the expected level of 10, and was the highest since September 2014. The July retail sales rise was the biggest in seven months, and the figures received a boost from sales of motor vehicles. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said: President Donald Trump will be breathing a sigh of relief today after the latest data showed retail sales in the US bounced back from a disappointing couple of months to move into positive territory. This indicates the US consumer is now choosing to spend rather than save, which bodes well for the economy\u2019s long-term growth and will put Fed chair Janet Yellen in a bullish mood. US retail sales rose by a higher than expected 0.6% in July, while the previous month\u2019s figure was revised upwards. Analysts had been expecting an increase of around 0.4% following two months of decline. But June\u2019s 0.2% fall was revised to a 0.3% increase. Over in the US, retail sales are due shortly and are expected to show a slight rebound after two months of decline. In June they fell 0.2% but analysts are forecasting a rise last month to between 0.3% and as much as 0.6%. The pound is now down 0.7% against the dollar at $1.2872, while against the euro it is down more than 0.4% \u20ac1.0951. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Sterling turned sour this Tuesday after July\u2019s UK CPI reading fell short of analysts\u2019 forecasts. While, at 2.6%, inflation is still troublesome \u2013 especially since wage growth is lurking around the 1.8% mark \u2013 it nevertheless wasn\u2019t as high as the expected 2.7%. More importantly, it\u2019s a decent way away from the 2.9% reading seen in May. And given that the Bank of England didn\u2019t pull the rate hike trigger at that level, they\u2019re not going to do it for anything lower, helping to explain why the pound found itself in such a bad mood once the figure was released. Cable more than doubled its losses and now finds itself back below $1.29 after plunging 0.7%, while against the euro sterling switched from a 0.3% rise to a 0.4% fall, dragging it to yet another fresh 10 month nadir. This allowed the FTSE to overcome its early reticence, the UK index climbing 25 points to sit just underneath the 7400 it abandoned during last week\u2019s North Korea-fearing trading. UK inflation may have come in lower than expected in July but it is higher than other major economies: More on the pound\u2019s weakness: Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on inflation and the rail fare increases: Rail commuters facing a steep 3.6% increase in ticket prices might find it tough to accept but there is light at the end of the tunnel for UK inflation. Rising prices have been one of the big economic stories of the past 12 months, but for the past two months the financial markets have been surprised by the weakness of cost-of-living pressures. The reason for that is simple: the two factors that have been driving inflation higher since the summer of 2016 \u2013 higher global oil prices and the sharp fall in the value of sterling after the EU referendum \u2013 have almost washed through the system. A quick look at the Office for National Statistics data for producer prices helps explain what has been going on. Producer prices are a measure of inflation early in the supply chain, since they gauge both the cost to firms of buying in fuel and raw material, and the prices of goods as they leave factory gates. Fuel and raw material prices rose fast in the second half of 2016, with the annual rate of increase peaking at 19.9% in January. Since then, though, it has fallen month after month, dropping from 10% in June to 6.5% in July. Larry\u2019s full analysis is here: The overall inflation figures may be understating the real cost of living for many people, says Simon McCulloch, director of comparethemarket.com: The fact that inflation has stayed at 2.6% tells only part of the story and certain segments of society are feeling the effects more than others. Our research shows that household bills are increasing at twice the rate of today\u2019s inflation figure\u200e, indicating that families - a group that may be more exposed to higher energy, insurance, petrol and broadband costs as well as mortgage payments - are affected in a more acute way than the ONS\u2019s headline 2.6% figure suggests. Whereas certain elements of the inflationary basket of goods may be remaining flat, households which are already feeling the squeeze are experiencing a period of rapid \u201cbillflation\u201d, with the average household paying out \u00a3845 a month. Even so, the pound is not acting as if a rate rise is on the cards any time soon. It is now down 0.52% at $1.2893 against the dollar - its lowest level for a month - and 0.35% lower against the euro at \u20ac1.0967. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: The pound has been largely out of favour ever since the Bank of England\u2019s last policy meeting a couple of weeks ago, where only two Monetary Policy Committee members voted for a rate rise. Given the recent rise in inflation and the general improvement in the UK economy, the markets were surprised by the BoE\u2019s dovishness. But today\u2019s release of the latest inflation data for the month of July underscores the BoE\u2019s cautious approach... the pound\u2019s immediate reaction was a swift drop. The fall in the pound has given a lift to the FTSE 100, especially its large number of overseas earners. The leading index is now up 0.4% to a day\u2019s high of 7384. Well, it seems not everyone thinks a UK interest rate rise before long can be ruled out. Nick Dixon, Pension Director at Aegon, said: After last month\u2019s surprise dip, inflation remains above target, although it has not continued its upward march in the way many expected. While concerns about stagnant wages, anaemic economic growth, and a reliance on cheap debt remain, sustained above-target inflation is continuing to build the case for an interest rates rise in the not-too-distant future. Such an increase would present new challenges, and new opportunities, for those owning investments whose valuations are linked with interest rates. All asset classes feel richly valued at present so we take a cautious view in aggregate, with particular concerns around fixed interest, real estate, non-sterling assets and US equities where valuations look particularly high. The Federation of Small Businesses has called for government help for companies to deal with inflationary pressures. National chairman Mike Cherry, said: Operating costs for small firms are now at their highest in four years. Increasing inflationary pressure has coincided with a bruising business rates revaluation and rising employment costs. Our entrepreneurs are paying themselves less and further increasing prices in an attempt to handle the strain. Four in ten small firms raised prices in response to April\u2019s National Living Wage increase. A hike in rail fares in line with today\u2019s RPI will put further pressure on the consumer pocket, leaving all concerned with less to spend and invest. The Government should consider whether this inflationary measure is fit for purpose in the twenty-first century. The Chancellor needs to give very careful consideration to the upcoming Budget. With small firms feeling the squeeze, any increase in insurance premium tax, fuel duty or other stealth taxes will be bad for investment and job creation. We need to see all tax reliefs maintained, not least entrepreneurs\u2019 relief, which represents an important incentive for our business owners. One general conclusion from today\u2019s inflation figures seems to be that they confirm the Bank of England is unlikely to raise interest rates any time soon. James Smith, economist at ING Bank: July was another disappointing month for UK inflation. Both headline and core CPI remained unchanged in year on year terms as the impact of the pound\u2019s fall failed to offset a 1.3% decline in petrol prices. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the weakness to any one-off quirks, but sizeable declines in the prices of clothing, footwear and household goods may potentially suggest that retailers have again had to cut prices to get shoppers buying their summer wares. Whatever the reason though, we still think headline inflation looks set to inch closer to 3% towards the end of this year as the full extent of sterling\u2019s near-20% fall since November 2015 filters through. But the big question for policymakers is where inflation would be if this currency effect is stripped out. One way of looking at this, by excluding goods with a high import-intensity, suggests that inflation would be slightly below 2% if the pound\u2019s fluctuations are removed. But what matters for the Bank of England is wage growth. We expect this to hold steady at 2% tomorrow, and in fact, for much of the rest of this year. The combination of slowing economic momentum, political uncertainty and rising import costs mean that firms are likely to have limited incentive to accelerate pay rises. While today\u2019s data will continue to test the patience of some BoE hawks, we expect the committee as a whole to continue \u2018looking through\u2019 inflation spikes in favour of slower growth. We don\u2019t expect a rate hike this year. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst: The Brexit vote inflation wave may have already crested. While today\u2019s number is lower than we saw a couple of months ago, it does not mean that inflation in itself is low. The defining driver of the run of higher prices has been the devaluation of the pound following the vote to leave the EU, those declines will start to fall out of the calculations in the coming months. The Bank of England is not under pressure to raise rates from prices at the moment, and will not be by the end of the year. Of course this could all change if sterling continues its recent decline against the euro. The lower than expected number is good news, but its importance can only be truly recognised once the context of tomorrow\u2019s wage numbers and Thursday\u2019s retail sales data is taken into account. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital: The expected pickup didn\u2019t happen. Inflation remains cooler and the pound dipped as investors had expected a rebound in July following the surprise drop in June...The data doesn\u2019t radically alter the view on the Bank of England, but it certainly cements the belief that a rate hike this year now looks highly unlikely. The market was positioned for a bit more inflation than we\u2019re getting. CPI is still expected to peak at 3% later this year before easing back, yet there are signs that inflation may have already peaked. The sterling exchange rate has stabilised, meaning far less pass-through from the weaker pound on the inflation rate. We\u2019re even getting to the stage in the year where the pound will be actually stronger than it was 12 months before, especially against the US dollar. Of course the pass-through from the exchange rate is a little more complex than that, but the broad picture is that the pound is pretty near to where it was last year. If inflation has peaked, it would be good news for British workers, with wages still falling in real terms (confirmation of this trend is expected in tomorrow\u2019s data). It would also be good news for the UK\u2019s consumer-driven economy, which may ultimately be pound positive if it means resilient growth and the Bank thinks it can hike gently without upsetting wider economic confidence. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: It now looks quite possible inflation has peaked, and will fall back further incoming months. The year-on-year increase in producers\u2019 raw material costs fell to 6.5% in July \u2013 undershooting forecasts for a 7.0% rise. This was down from 10% in June, the biggest month-to-month slowdown in almost five years. Input prices are a leading indicator for consumer price inflation as higher input prices are often ultimately passed on to the consumer, and therefore a lower number here could bode well for softer consumer prices down the line. All this is good news for the consumer, as it helps alleviate the continuing squeeze on household finances, though pay is still shrinking in real terms for now. Tomorrow\u2019s labour market update is expected to show wage growth remained at 1.8% for the three months to July. It\u2019s also good news for borrowers \u2013 moderating inflation means less pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates, and will allow the MPC to remove the sticking plaster of ultra-low interest rates very slowly indeed. With only two of the eight members voting for higher rates earlier this month, it seems even a return to 0.5% is some way off for now. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International: The income squeeze on cash-strapped UK consumers continues with July\u2019s inflation reading showing the CPI (Consumer Price Index) remaining at 2.6%. The main drivers behind this month\u2019s food price inflation are a rise in the cost of bread and cereals, meat and fruit. However, this month the main focus will be on the RPI (Retail Prices Index) reading, as the July figure is used to determine by how much rail fares will increase in the new year. Commuters will face an eye-watering 3.6% increase in the cost of \u2018anytime\u2019 and season tickets in England and Wales in 2018, adding to mounting expenses. UK households continue to feel the squeeze as price rises continue to outpace earnings. Rising inflation coupled with dwindling wage growth means real wages are falling. In its August inflation report, the Bank of England pointed out that uncertainty over the economic outlook may be affecting companies\u2019 willingness to raise pay, projecting that regular pay growth will remain subdued over the rest of 2017. The Bank expects inflation to fall back towards the 2% target during 2018 as past increases in fuel prices drop out of the annual comparison, but this will mean very little if our earnings fail to keep up with price rises. Over the longer term, expect rising inflation to be a fleeting occurrence due to a number of economic trends. First, an aging population limits the size of the global workforce, which by corollary suppresses economic activity. Meanwhile rising inequality and the growing cohort of self-employed people with limited earning power, such as Uber drivers in the \u2018gig economy\u2019, means less money is being spent. Less economic activity, and less money spent, means prices are unlikely to be driven upwards, keeping a lid on inflation over the long term. If inflation stays low and economic growth remains tepid, there is no reason for the Bank of England to risk the economic recovery by putting up interest rates any time soon. Good news for borrowers, bad news for savers and retirees. Both measures of inflation have been rising steadily since a year ago: Here\u2019s our news story on how the rise in the retail price index will lead to higher rail fares: Here\u2019s some commentary on inflation: Here\u2019s the UK Treasury\u2019s response to the inflation figures: Although inflation is likely to start falling next year, we understand some families are concerned today about the cost of living. That is why we have given the lowest paid a pay rise through the National Living Wage and are cutting taxes for 31 million people. The pound has edged slightly lower against the dollar following the inflation data. It now stands at $1.2923, down 0.3%, as the prospects of any imminent rate rise fade further. Fuel prices fell by 1.3% between June and July 2017, the fifth successive month of price decreases, said the ONS. Over the same period last year they rose by 0.7%. There were smaller rises for a range of goods and services, but the ONS added: The 12-month inflation rates for some of the broad groupings (namely food and non-alcoholic beverages; clothing and footwear; miscellaneous goods and services; furniture and household goods) have edged up to the highest seen for several years. This chart shows how the consumer prices index (in yellow) had been rising fairly steadily since last summer until last month\u2019s dip: The Office for National Statistics said falling motor fuel prices were offset by higher prices for clothes, utilities and food. House prices rose 4.9% in June, said the ONS, compared to 5% in May. This is the weakest since March. The consumer price index had been expected to rise from 2.6% to 2.7%, rather than hold steady. But it still means that living standards are being squeezed. Wage growth has been lagging behind price rises and this is expected to continue in coming months. Economists expect average weekly earnings to have grown by 1.8% year-on-year in the three months to June, the same figure as last time. Stripping out bonuses, the figure is forecast to be 2%. Breaking: Britain\u2019s inflation rate has unexpectedly held steady at 2.6% in July,. That\u2019s the consumer price index, which is the Bank of England\u2019s preferred measure when considering the level of interest rates. The retail price index has climbed to a higher than expected 3.6%. and this is bad news for train passengers: it is the level used by the government to set rail fare increases. Another reason for the strengthening of the dollar is Monday\u2019s comment from one of the US Federal Reserve members about the prospects of further interest rate rises this year. Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG explains: The US dollar has strengthened following relatively hawkish comments from Fed Vice Chair William Dudley, who stated that he would \u201cbe in favour of doing another rate hike later this year\u201d if the economy continues to hold up in line with his expectations. The recent softer-than-expected US inflation readings do not appear to have dampened his appetite to continue raising rates gradually as much as the market is currently anticipating. He also signalled that market expectations for a September announcement from the Fed on when it plans to begin shrinking their balance sheet were not \u201cunreasonable\u201d. Overall the comments should offer some support for the US dollar in the near-term but the market is likely to remain sceptical over the likelihood of another rate hike later this year at the current juncture. Ahead of the UK inflation figures, here\u2019s a list of what economists are expecting the figure to be at the year end: Markets are - just about - holding onto their early gains but Rebecca O\u2019Keefe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, is urging caution: The ease with which equity markets have shrugged off last week\u2019s woes is reassuring, but also a little bit frightening. Reassuring in that it confirms there is a wave of liquidity willing and actively looking for buying opportunities on any dips. Frightening in that markets appear to be utterly invincible to any threat, despite potentially stretched valuations. It looked like the market was at a tipping point last week, but the robust rally over the past two days suggests that there are still plenty of investors who think otherwise. Trying to call the top of this market has been a fool\u2019s errand over the past few months and the weight of money supporting the market doesn\u2019t show any sign of abating. Meanwhile after the latest Brexit moves and ahead of the UK inflation figures, the pound is still managing to keep fairly steady, down just 0.2% against the dollar at $1.2939. The dip is partly due to the US currency strengthening as tensions over North Korea ease somewhat. The prospect of a deal between the UK and the EU to retain the key benefits of the customs union for a period following Brexit has also done little to lift the pound. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: Sterling didn\u2019t budge much at all despite signs we may be in for a smoother Brexit. There was little to no uplift so far from the proposal for Britain to have a customs union with the EU for some years after the official Brexit date in 2019. The market is treating anything from London with due caution, rightly so given the open splits in the cabinet and precarious tenure of Theresa May. The real test comes when the third round of Brexit talks begin. If it flies with Michel Barnier and co it could be a lot more pound positive than we\u2019re seeing now. There are also doubts about whether this would be palatable for the Brexit camp in parliament and among voters if it involves compromises on the divorce bill and the free movement of people. It also doesn\u2019t address services, although it is a pretty good guide to what the government will pursue on that front. If you\u2019re a pound bull this looks like a big step, and a signal that the softer transition side in government is winning the argument, but the sanguine response from the markets only highlights how far we have to go in the negotiation process. We\u2019ve also got the CPI inflation data out at 09:30 that is keeping money on the side lines for the time being. A rise to 2.7% is expected which is not going to shift the dial on what the market expects from the Bank of England. It will have to be a big beat (which looks unlikely given the retreat last month) to get people talking up a rate hike this year again.\u201d With the easing of tensions over North Korea, markets are edging higher at the open. Ahead of the UK inflation figures, the FTSE 100 has added 0.11% while Germany\u2019s Dax opened 0.5% higher and France\u2019s Cac and Spain\u2019s Ibex are both up 0.4%. Here\u2019s World First economist Jeremy Cook on the UK inflation figures and the possible effect on the pound: The German economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, which is good news for Chancellor Merkel ahead of the forthcoming elections, even if the figure was slightly below forecasts. The quarter on quarter rate was lower than a revised 0.7% figure for the first quarter and the forecast of a similar level for the second three months. The annualised rate of growth was 2.1%, up from 2% in the first quarter. This was well below the 4% recorded by Japan on Monday, but above the UK\u2019s 1.7%. The Federal Statistics Office said domestic demand grew but foreign trade slipped back: The quarter-on-quarter comparison (upon adjustment for price, seasonal and calendar variations) shows that positive contributions came from domestic demand. Final consumption expenditure of both households and general government increased markedly... According to provisional calculations, the development of foreign trade, however, had a downward effect on growth because the price-adjusted quarter-on-quarter increase in imports was considerably larger than that of exports. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said: The German economy continues its strong performance with another above-trend growth rate of 0.6% QoQ in 2Q 17. Even in its ninth year, the German economic recovery is still going strong. GDP growth in the second quarter came in at 0.6% QoQ, from a slightly upwardly revised 0.7% QoQ in the first quarter of 2017. On the year, the German economy grew by 2.1%. The detailed growth components will only be released towards the end of the month but based on monthly data the economy continues firing on all cylinders. Growth was driven by public and private consumption, investment and the construction sector. Germany\u2019s economic success story goes on and on and on. And there is very little reason to fear a sudden end to the current performance, even though some kind of slowdown from current growth rates looks almost inevitable. The drivers supporting the domestic economy, like record high employment, higher wages and government consumption, might lose some momentum along the way, without turning negative. The same holds for the export sector, where a stronger euro, weaker-than-expected US growth and Brexit uncertainty could take some wind out of the sails without bringing exports to a halt. While the current growth drivers could lose some momentum, investments could emerge as the new engine going into the second half of the year and beyond. Since the small setback at the turn of the year, production expectations have increased continuously. Order books are filled again and inventories have been reduced. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing industry has also increased continuously since mid-2016 and is now clearly above its historical average. A combination which under normal circumstances should be a safe bet for stronger investments. With today\u2019s strong growth data, it will be hard for any opposition party to pick out the economy as a main theme for the final stage of the election campaign. Even Angela Merkel\u2019s junior coalition partner, the social-democratic SPD, finds it hard to get the credits from the electorate for the current strong growth performance. When it comes to the economy, it seems as if Angela Merkel sits in a \u201cwinner-takes-it-all\u201d position. The lack of new structural reforms or the lack of investments (both in traditional and digital infrastructure) has so far not affected voters\u2019 preferences. All in all, the German economy is still thriving and currently the biggest risk is probably policy complacency. Still, it looks increasingly unlikely that economic topics will decide the upcoming elections. After last week\u2019s market turmoil caused by North Korea and the US being at loggerheads, an easing of the tensions between the two countries has seen a sense of calm return. Not only does North Korea appear to be toning down some of the belligerent rhetoric, but China has stepped in to comply with UN sanctions against the country. So after Monday\u2019s gains, markets are expected to move higher again at the open: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A busier day for economic figures sees the release of UK inflation data and US retail sales figures for July. We\u2019ve already had German GDP figures, which have come in slightly below expectations (more shortly.....) On the UK inflation front, the consumer price index is expected to edge up from 2.6% year on year to 2.7% after a surprise fall in June. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: When the last set of inflation numbers were released in June they showed a sharp fall in headline CPI from 2.9% to 2.6%, a welcome decline at a time when consumers have been feeling an increasing squeeze on their incomes. This fall raised hopes that inflation may well have peaked and today\u2019s July CPI numbers could well go further in reinforcing that belief, though most expectations are for a tick back higher to 2.7%, while core CPI is also expected to rise to 2.5% from 2.4%. A rise would be at odds with the recent softening in recent PPI numbers, which have slipped from 20% at the beginning of the year and could come in as low as 6.9% in today\u2019s July numbers, but in line with the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts which suggest we could see 3% before year end. Despite the Bank\u2019s recent dovishness regarding interest rates, any increase could put that conviction to the test. But with the pound steady at $1.2963, the market clearly believes there is no hurry for the next rate rise. Meanwhile the retail price index - expected to come in at 3.5% - will be of particular interest to Britain\u2019s train passengers (which, let\u2019s face it, is most of us at one point or another.) For some reason the July RPI is used to calculate rail fare increases which come into effect in January, so prepare for further hikes. Here\u2019s our preview of the inflation figures: Elsewhere we get US retail sales figures later which could show a pick-up in consumer spending after an underwhelming second quarter.

Sterling is now down 0.9% at $1.2848. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A rebound in retail sales in the US in July has triggered further gains in the US dollar on Tuesday, sending the greenback to its highest level in almost three weeks.</p> <p>Retail sales have been very underwhelming this year which has contributed to the view that the economy isn\u2019t ready for another rate hike this year. The dollar was already relatively well bid heading into the release on the back of some hawkish comments from William Dudley on Monday and today\u2019s release is doing that no harm. Not only did the July numbers comfortably beat expectations but the June numbers were also revised higher, providing an additional boost for dollar bulls.</p> <p>While today\u2019s report will likely increase the chances of another rate hike this year, it is still far from being priced in by the markets. The general trend of retail sales still remains worrying, despite the improvement over the last couple of months and 2% inflation still looks a pipe dream. That said, the dollar has been so heavily sold over the course of the year that even a slight unwinding of these trades could provide a near-term boost to the greenback. The dollar index has recently been languishing at levels seen only half a dozen times or so since the start of 2015 but not yet breached. With that in mind, it may take relatively little at the moment to get such a reaction in the dollar. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5992ee43e4b0ae030608a809\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T12:53:57.044Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The strong US retail sales could portend a good third quarter economic performance, and a December rate rise from the Federal Reserve. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>US retail sales figures for July are very good, rising 0.6% month on month in July versus the consensus 0.3% forecast. There were also big upward revisions from -0.2% month on month to +0.3% month on month for June.</p> <p>There were broad based gains with 10 of the 13 broad retail categories reporting rising sales. This suggests the household sector is strong and in our view bodes well for a 3% GDP figure for third quarter 2017 growth. With consumer confidence at firm levels, employment continuing to rise and wages showing some evidence of picking up we remain optimistic on the prospects for consumer spending.</p> <p>The details of the report show that gasoline sales were a drag (-0.4%) due to lower prices and with this category excluded sales were up 0.7%. There were strong performances from motor vehicles and building materials (both up 1.2%) with internet, department stores and miscellaneous stores also performing strongly. The only areas of disappointment were electronics (-0.5%) and clothing (-0.3%).</p> <p>Markets continue to focus on current low inflation rates, but with the labour market tightening and the growth story looking ok the prevailing view within the Fed is likely to remain that low inflation is merely \u201ctransient\u201d. We think inflation will be back at the 2% target by the end of the year and also predict a December Fed rate hike. We continue to expect two more 25bp hikes next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5992ecf5e4b0b54351f65509\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T12:45:48.360Z\">1.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CityIndex/status/897436143624605698\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The dollar index is benefitting from the positive surprise in the US economic data, key resistance coming up fro DXY at 93.54 - recent high.</p>&mdash; City Index (@CityIndex) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CityIndex/status/897436143624605698\">August 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5992ebede4b0b54351f65503\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T12:42:50.237Z\">1.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At the sam time as the US retail sales, there has been more positive data, with the New York Federal Reserve\u2019s Empire State business conditions jumping from 9.8 in July to 25.2 in August.

Both headline and core CPI remained unchanged in year on year terms as the impact of the pound\u2019s fall failed to offset a 1.3% decline in petrol prices. It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the weakness to any one-off quirks, but sizeable declines in the prices of clothing, footwear and household goods may potentially suggest that retailers have again had to cut prices to get shoppers buying their summer wares.</p> <p>Whatever the reason though, we still think headline inflation looks set to inch closer to 3% towards the end of this year as the full extent of sterling\u2019s near-20% fall since November 2015 filters through. But the big question for policymakers is where inflation would be if this currency effect is stripped out. One way of looking at this, by excluding goods with a high import-intensity, suggests that inflation would be slightly below 2% if the pound\u2019s fluctuations are removed.</p> <p>But what matters for the Bank of England is wage growth. We expect this to hold steady at 2% tomorrow, and in fact, for much of the rest of this year. The combination of slowing economic momentum, political uncertainty and rising import costs mean that firms are likely to have limited incentive to accelerate pay rises.</p> <p>While today\u2019s data will continue to test the patience of some BoE hawks, we expect the committee as a whole to continue \u2018looking through\u2019 inflation spikes in favour of slower growth. We don\u2019t expect a rate hike this year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ad9a7878e5940476473223663b5ad1284b0cc1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ad9a7878e5940476473223663b5ad1284b0cc1a/0_99_2267_1360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clothing sales showed smaller falls compared to a year ago\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clothing sales showed smaller falls compared to a year ago</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at WorldFirst:</strong></h2> <p>The Brexit vote inflation wave may have already crested. While today\u2019s number is lower than we saw a couple of months ago, it does not mean that inflation in itself is low. The defining driver of the run of higher prices has been the devaluation of the pound following the vote to leave the EU, those declines will start to fall out of the calculations in the coming months.</p> <p>The Bank of England is not under pressure to raise rates from prices at the moment, and will not be by the end of the year. Of course this could all change if sterling continues its recent decline against the euro.</p> <p>The lower than expected number is good news, but its importance can only be truly recognised once the context of tomorrow\u2019s wage numbers and Thursday\u2019s retail sales data is taken into account.</p> <h2>Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital:</h2> <p>The expected pickup didn\u2019t happen. Inflation remains cooler and the pound dipped as investors had expected a rebound in July following the surprise drop in June...The data doesn\u2019t radically alter the view on the Bank of England, but it certainly cements the belief that a rate hike this year now looks highly unlikely. The market was positioned for a bit more inflation than we\u2019re getting.</p> <p>CPI is still expected to peak at 3% later this year before easing back, yet there are signs that inflation may have already peaked. The sterling exchange rate has stabilised, meaning far less pass-through from the weaker pound on the inflation rate. We\u2019re even getting to the stage in the year where the pound will be actually stronger than it was 12 months before, especially against the US dollar. Of course the pass-through from the exchange rate is a little more complex than that, but the broad picture is that the pound is pretty near to where it was last year.</p> <p>If inflation has peaked, it would be good news for British workers, with wages still falling in real terms (confirmation of this trend is expected in tomorrow\u2019s data). It would also be good news for the UK\u2019s consumer-driven economy, which may ultimately be pound positive if it means resilient growth and the Bank thinks it can hike gently without upsetting wider economic confidence.</p> <h2><strong>Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown:</strong></h2> <p>It now looks quite possible inflation has peaked, and will fall back further incoming months. The year-on-year increase in producers\u2019 raw material costs fell to 6.5% in July \u2013 undershooting forecasts for a 7.0% rise. This was down from 10% in June, the biggest month-to-month slowdown in almost five years. Input prices are a leading indicator for consumer price inflation as higher input prices are often ultimately passed on to the consumer, and therefore a lower number here could bode well for softer consumer prices down the line.</p> <p>All this is good news for the consumer, as it helps alleviate the continuing squeeze on household finances, though pay is still shrinking in real terms for now. Tomorrow\u2019s labour market update is expected to show wage growth remained at 1.8% for the three months to July.</p> <p>It\u2019s also good news for borrowers \u2013 moderating inflation means less pressure on the Bank of England to consider raising interest rates, and will allow the MPC to remove the sticking plaster of ultra-low interest rates very slowly indeed. With only two of the eight members voting for higher rates earlier this month, it seems even a return to 0.5% is some way off for now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a424b317209c93ab65057fdede7b95b7319cf39f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a424b317209c93ab65057fdede7b95b7319cf39f/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protests this month outside the Bank of England over low pay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protests this month outside the Bank of England over low pay</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International:</strong></h2> <p>The income squeeze on cash-strapped UK consumers continues with July\u2019s inflation reading showing the CPI (Consumer Price Index) remaining at 2.6%. The main drivers behind this month\u2019s food price inflation are a rise in the cost of bread and cereals, meat and fruit. However, this month the main focus will be on the RPI (Retail Prices Index) reading, as the July figure is used to determine by how much rail fares will increase in the new year. Commuters will face an eye-watering 3.6% increase in the cost of \u2018anytime\u2019 and season tickets in England and Wales in 2018, adding to mounting expenses.<br></p> <p>UK households continue to feel the squeeze as price rises continue to outpace earnings. Rising inflation coupled with dwindling wage growth means real wages are falling. In its August inflation report, the Bank of England pointed out that uncertainty over the economic outlook may be affecting companies\u2019 willingness to raise pay, projecting that regular pay growth will remain subdued over the rest of 2017. </p> <p>The Bank expects inflation to fall back towards the 2% target during 2018 as past increases in fuel prices drop out of the annual comparison, but this will mean very little if our earnings fail to keep up with price rises. </p> <p>Over the longer term, expect rising inflation to be a fleeting occurrence due to a number of economic trends. First, an aging population limits the size of the global workforce, which by corollary suppresses economic activity. Meanwhile rising inequality and the growing cohort of self-employed people with limited earning power, such as Uber drivers in the \u2018gig economy\u2019, means less money is being spent.</p> <p>Less economic activity, and less money spent, means prices are unlikely to be driven upwards, keeping a lid on inflation over the long term.</p> <p>If inflation stays low and economic growth remains tepid, there is no reason for the Bank of England to risk the economic recovery by putting up interest rates any time soon. Good news for borrowers, bad news for savers and retirees.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5992ba72e4b01697d0ab0eb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T09:11:24.168Z\">10.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Both measures of inflation have been rising steadily since a year ago:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2017-08-15T09:08:17/embed.html\" data-alt=\"CPI and RPI\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/aug/2017-08-15T09:08:17/embed.html\">CPI and RPI</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5992b9f0e4b01697d0ab0eb7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T09:08:52.654Z\">10.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s our news story on how the rise in the retail price index will lead to higher rail fares:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/15/commuters-brace-for-steepest-fare-rise-in-five-years-as-uk-inflation-rises-to-36\">Commuters brace for steepest fare rise in five years as UK inflation rises to 3.6%</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5992b6f0e4b06ab47f95f1c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T09:03:34.511Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s some commentary on inflation:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/897376792025190400\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Headline and core CPI weaker than expected but producer price inflation a touch stronger than consensus. 1/2</p>&mdash; Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DuncanWeldon/status/897376792025190400\">August 15, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DrGerardLyons/status/897380115172208640\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1.

Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling didn\u2019t budge much at all despite signs we may be in for a smoother Brexit. There was little to no uplift so far from the proposal for Britain to have a customs union with the EU for some years after the official Brexit date in 2019.</p> <p>The market is treating anything from London with due caution, rightly so given the open splits in the cabinet and precarious tenure of Theresa May.</p> <p>The real test comes when the third round of Brexit talks begin. If it flies with Michel Barnier and co it could be a lot more pound positive than we\u2019re seeing now. There are also doubts about whether this would be palatable for the Brexit camp in parliament and among voters if it involves compromises on the divorce bill and the free movement of people. It also doesn\u2019t address services, although it is a pretty good guide to what the government will pursue on that front.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a pound bull this looks like a big step, and a signal that the softer transition side in government is winning the argument, but the sanguine response from the markets only highlights how far we have to go in the negotiation process. </p> <p>We\u2019ve also got the CPI inflation data out at 09:30 that is keeping money on the side lines for the time being. A rise to 2.7% is expected which is not going to shift the dial on what the market expects from the Bank of England. It will have to be a big beat (which looks unlikely given the retreat last month) to get people talking up a rate hike this year again.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59929e27e4b087374fd0d903\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T07:15:55.684Z\">8.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European markets open higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the easing of tensions over North Korea, markets are edging higher at the open.</p> <p>Ahead of the UK inflation figures, the FTSE 100 has added 0.11% while Germany\u2019s Dax opened 0.5% higher and France\u2019s Cac and Spain\u2019s Ibex are both up 0.4%.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59929dcce4b06ab47f95f174\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T07:09:25.523Z\">8.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s World First economist Jeremy Cook on the UK inflation figures and the possible effect on the pound:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/World_First/status/897347403560497154\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Gotta say that today\u2019s UK CPI release, unless an absolute flyer, is likely to be negative sterling.

GDP growth in the second quarter came in at 0.6% QoQ, from a slightly upwardly revised 0.7% QoQ in the first quarter of 2017. On the year, the German economy grew by 2.1%.</p> <p>The detailed growth components will only be released towards the end of the month but based on monthly data the economy continues firing on all cylinders. Growth was driven by public and private consumption, investment and the construction sector.</p> <p>Germany\u2019s economic success story goes on and on and on. And there is very little reason to fear a sudden end to the current performance, even though some kind of slowdown from current growth rates looks almost inevitable. The drivers supporting the domestic economy, like record high employment, higher wages and government consumption, might lose some momentum along the way, without turning negative. The same holds for the export sector, where a stronger euro, weaker-than-expected US growth and Brexit uncertainty could take some wind out of the sails without bringing exports to a halt.</p> <p>While the current growth drivers could lose some momentum, investments could emerge as the new engine going into the second half of the year and beyond. Since the small setback at the turn of the year, production expectations have increased continuously. Order books are filled again and inventories have been reduced. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing industry has also increased continuously since mid-2016 and is now clearly above its historical average. A combination which under normal circumstances should be a safe bet for stronger investments.</p> <p>With today\u2019s strong growth data, it will be hard for any opposition party to pick out the economy as a main theme for the final stage of the election campaign. Even Angela Merkel\u2019s junior coalition partner, the social-democratic SPD, finds it hard to get the credits from the electorate for the current strong growth performance. When it comes to the economy, it seems as if Angela Merkel sits in a \u201cwinner-takes-it-all\u201d position. The lack of new structural reforms or the lack of investments (both in traditional and digital infrastructure) has so far not affected voters\u2019 preferences.</p> <p>All in all, the German economy is still thriving and currently the biggest risk is probably policy complacency. Still, it looks increasingly unlikely that economic topics will decide the upcoming elections.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59929452e4b06ab47f95f14f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T06:31:47.353Z\">7.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After last week\u2019s market turmoil caused by North Korea and the US being at loggerheads, an easing of the tensions between the two countries has seen a sense of calm return.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When the last set of inflation numbers were released in June they showed a sharp fall in headline CPI from 2.9% to 2.6%, a welcome decline at a time when consumers have been feeling an increasing squeeze on their incomes. This fall raised hopes that inflation may well have peaked and today\u2019s July CPI numbers could well go further in reinforcing that belief, though most expectations are for a tick back higher to 2.7%, while core CPI is also expected to rise to 2.5% from 2.4%.</p> <p>A rise would be at odds with the recent softening in recent PPI numbers, which have slipped from 20% at the beginning of the year and could come in as low as 6.9% in today\u2019s July numbers, but in line with the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts which suggest we could see 3% before year end.</p> </blockquote> <p>Despite the Bank\u2019s recent dovishness regarding interest rates, any increase could put that conviction to the test. But with the pound steady at $1.2963, the market clearly believes there is no hurry for the next rate rise.</p> <p>Meanwhile the retail price index - expected to come in at 3.5% - will be of particular interest to Britain\u2019s train passengers (which, let\u2019s face it, is most of us at one point or another.) For some reason the July RPI is used to calculate rail fare increases which come into effect in January, so prepare for further hikes.</p> <p>Here\u2019s our preview of the inflation figures:<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/13/uk-inflation-tipped-to-rise-again-with-wages-forecast-to-stagnate\">UK inflation tipped to rise again with wages forecast to stagnate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere we get US retail sales figures later which could show a pick-up in consumer spending after an underwhelming second quarter.</p> <p><strong>The agenda:</strong></p> <p>9.30 BST: UK inflation figures</p> <p>1.30 BST: US retail sales</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-08-15T08:58:08.897Z\">at 9.58am BST</time></p>  </div>",

The average UK house price rose by \u00a32,000 in June to \u00a3223,000 compared with the previous month, almost \u00a310,000 higher than a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While the annual growth rate has slowed since the middle of last year following the vote to leave the EU, prices are still outstripping increases in inflation and wages, at 4.9% in the year to June, down from 5% in May. London experienced a \u00a33,000 drop in the average price of a home to \u00a3482,000 in June from the previous month, but remains the most expensive UK region in which to own a property. The value of a home in the capital increased by 2.9% against the same time last year, while the lowest average price continues to be in the north-east, at \u00a3130,000, where prices rose by 2.5% over the year. The fastest growing part of the country for home values was the east of England, with growth of 7.2% in the year to June, followed by the east Midlands at 7.1%. James Tucker, the head of consumer price inflation at the ONS, said annual house price growth had slipped back \u201cmainly due to the south and east of England, which have seen particularly pronounced slowdowns in the last year\u201d. Despite slower increases in the value of property, first-time buyers are still entering the market, according to data published separately on Tuesday by the trade body UK Finance. New homeowners borrowed \u00a35.9bn in June, up 26% on the previous month and 9% on the same time a year ago. A spokesman for the organisation, which replaced the Council of Mortgage Lenders last month, said the increase reflected a tendency for homebuyers to make purchases in the spring. The latest house price figures came as rail commuters braced for the steepest fare rise in five years as inflation hit 3.6% in July. The rise is set by the government and linked to last month\u2019s retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation announced by the ONS on Tuesday. The higher fares will take effect from January. In June, the most expensive borough to live in was Kensington and Chelsea in London, where the average cost of a house was \u00a31.4m. In contrast, the cheapest area was Blaenau Gwent in south Wales, where a house cost \u00a380,000 on average. The only region where house prices have still not recovered to the pre-financial crisis peak is the north-east, where they remain 6% below their September 2007 level.",

      "bodyText": "Rail fares for commuters in England and Wales will increase by 3.6% from next year, adding pressure to incomes already squeezed by higher prices. The rise, the biggest annual increase in five years, is set by the government and linked to July\u2019s retail price index (RPI) measure of inflation announced by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday. The higher fares will take effect from January. Economists had expected RPI to increase to 3.5% in July, while rail fares rose by 2.3% at the start of 2017 based on last year\u2019s figures. The change applies to about 40% of rail fares, including season tickets on many commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities. So-called regulated fares are set by the government but normally provide the benchmark for rises across the network. Unions and campaigners have been holding protests against the rises at railway stations around the country. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said government policies of holding down wages while allowing fares to rise was a \u201ctoxic combination\u201d. He said: \u201cThe private operators and government say the rises are necessary to fund investment but the reality is that they are pocketing the profits while passengers are paying more for less with rail engineering work being delayed or cancelled, skilled railway jobs being lost and staff cut on trains, stations and at ticket offices.\u201d The Aslef general secretary, Mick Whelan, called for the system to be reformed, saying: \u201cThe government must intervene to make fares simpler, fairer and cheaper in Brexit Britain. Passengers and taxpayers will rightly be asking what they are paying for.\u201d He said fares should at the least be linked to the consumer price index (CPI), which rose by 2.6% in July, rather than RPI. Stephen Joseph, the chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, called for a fares freeze: \u201c[The government\u2019s] frozen fuel duty for the last seven years and we think rail fares should be given the same treatment.\u201d Joseph also said it was unacceptable that the government continued to use the higher RPI rate to calculate rail fare rises. \u201cPassengers would be forgiven for thinking they are being taken for a ride when RPI has been dropped as an official measure for most other things.\u201d The rail industry defended the steep increase. Paul Plummer, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, representing train companies and Network Rail, said: \u201cMoney from fares pays to run and improve the railway, making journeys better, boosting the economy, creating skilled jobs and supporting communities across Britain. It\u2019s also the case that many major rail industry costs rise directly in line with RPI.\u201d Inflation had been expected to rise again after an unexpected fall in June, helped by falling fuel prices, which offset the rising costs of food, clothing and household goods. Although CPI did not resume its upward trajectory last month, it is still running above the government\u2019s 2% inflation target and outstripping the pace of wage rises. That has led to a rising cost of living, heaping pressure on households. Consumers are using credit cards to fund spending and the Bank of England has expressed alarm about the increase in personal debt. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at data company IHS Markit, said there were still risks \u201cskewed towards inflation rising in coming months\u201d, while wage growth is expected to remain below 2%. James Tucker, the head of CPI inflation at the Office for National Statistics, said RPI was not seen as a good measure by the statistics authority. However, the Treasury said the use of RPI was \u201cconsistent with the general approach adopted across the rail industry\u201d, while the measure is used to account for inflation in the cost of running train services. \u201cAlthough inflation is likely to start falling next year, we understand some families are concerned today about the cost of living,\u201d a Treasury spokesperson added. Labour said the latest rise meant the average commuter will be paying \u00a32,888 for their season ticket in January, \u00a3694 more than they paid in 2010. Some are paying over \u00a32,500 more to travel to work than in 2010, it added. A Virgin Trains season ticket between Birmingham and London Euston will now cost \u00a310,567, while season tickets on some routes have risen by more than 40% since 2010. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said the rises were \u201ctruly staggering\u201d, adding: \u201cThe truth is that our fragmented, privatised railway drives up costs and leaves passengers paying more for less. The railways need serious reform.\u201d In Scotland, the blow for some rail travellers will be eased slightly as the Scottish government plans to limit regulated off-peak fares to an increase of 1% below RPI, or 2.6%, although season tickets will rise at the RPI rate.",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s natural gas export boom, which is causing soaring gas prices and pushing up carbon emissions, appears to be rapidly shedding value. Santos wiped more than $1bn off the value of its liquefied natural gas plant in Queensland on Tuesday, just a week after Origin announced a similar devaluation. The devaluations were predicted by commentators, who pointed out previous devaluations of the projects relied on overly-optimistic forecasts. \u201cThe whole project was built on over-inflated forecasts,\u201d said Dan Gocher from the financial activist group Market Forces. The Santos share price dipped a further 2.39% on Tuesday morning after a drop of more than 85% since its peak in 2008. \u201cThis industry has torn up its shareholders\u2019 wealth and now it\u2019s tearing up the nation\u2019s wealth,\u201d said Bruce Robertson from the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. On Tuesday Santos announced it was expecting to wipe more than A$1bn off the value of its GLNG plant on Curtis Island in Queensland. Just last week Origin announced a post-tax $815m devaluation of its APLNG facility on Curtis Island \u2013 a figure that implies more than a billion-dollar devaluation before tax. Along with another facility on Curtis Island owned by Shell, the three plants are responsible for Australia\u2019s LNG export boom, which has been vacuuming Australia\u2019s gas and caused domestic prices to skyrocket. Each plant has been shedding value since construction began. Shell\u2019s plant was US$7bn over budget, and then suffered a $5.4bn pre-tax devaluation in 2015. Between Santos and Origin, the two plants have now been devalued by about $6bn. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions rose dramatically in the latest quarterly emissions report, a rise that is mostly caused by the operation of the three LNG plants. Those emissions have widely been acknowledged as massively underestimated, since fugitive emissions \u2013 leaks of unburned gas \u2013 are poorly monitored. Gocher said the poor finances of the operations shows a huge opportunity was wasted. \u201cI think $60bn was put into it, and that wasn\u2019t a long time ago, and that could have gone to transitioning our electricity industry,\u201d Gocher said. \u201cThat capital was sourced from shareholders, and it could have been directed elsewhere. And now each year more of it is getting written off.\u201d Export gas prices are linked to the price of oil, and Santos said lower-than-expected oil prices were to blame for the devaluation. But Santos came under criticism in 2016 when it announced an even bigger devaluation, with commentators pointing out it relied on a heroic oil price forecast, inflating the remaining value of the facility. At the time, its forecasted oil prices were higher than that of the World Bank and Goldman Sachs, as well as competitors Woodside Petroleum and Beach Energy. The company has now downgraded its forecast, causing the new loss of value. But even the new forecasts appear more optimistic of a bounce in the oil price than even Origin. Last week Origin forecast that the price of a barrel of oil would be US$67 in 2022, but Santos today forecast it would be US$70 \u2013 a big fall from its forecast of more than $84 last year. But these figures remain higher than some other forecasts, suggesting the companies might face further devaluations. The World Bank forecasts oil to sit at US$66 a barrel in 2022. The export facilities are understood to be fulfilling long-term contracts for the sale of LNG to customers at loss-making prices. Robertson said he expected that half the production facilities at the three plants would be shut down within two years. In the meantime, Australia\u2019s hotly debated gas prices have been driven up so high that AGL is pressing ahead with plans to build an LNG import terminal in Victoria, taking advantage of the domestic prices. Santos declined to comment.",
