      "bodyText": "Mariano Rajoy's conservative government announced Spain's most austere budget for more than three decades \u2013 the day after a million protesters took to Spanish streets. \"We are taking extraordinary measures because the situation is extraordinary,\" the budget minister, Crist\u00f3bal Montoro, said before announcing \u20ac27bn (\u00a322.5bn) in spending cuts and tax rises. Markets and fellow eurozone members increasingly fear that Spain \u2013 whose economy is twice the size of that of Greece, Ireland and Portugal put together \u2013 could be the biggest threat to their future. \"Spain is going to stop being a problem, especially for the Spanish people, but also for the European Union,\" finance minister Luis de Guindos said as he prepared to explain the austerity measures to concerned eurozone ministers who were meeting in Copenhagen. It was unclear whether the complex \u20ac27bn adjustment, which included \u20ac15bn in tax rises and spending cuts announced in December, would convince the markets. \"This is as austere as it gets. It's a tightening of fiscal policy until the pips squeak,\" said Nicholas Spiro at Spiro Sovereign Strategy. \"There can be no doubting the government's willingness to curb Spain's excessive budget deficits.\" Pressure eased slightly on Spain's bond yields on Friday, suggesting the initial reaction was positive, but some analysts said they needed to study the measures more closely. Montoro avoided raising headline corporate taxes and sales taxes in an attempt to limit damage to consumer spending in a country already tumbling into recession. The government estimates the economy will shrink by 1.7% this year. He insisted that, with unemployment at 23% and climbing, he had tried to avoid hurting the economy's chances of recovery. But economists have warned the deficit-cutting measures demanded of Spain this year will take two percentage points of GDP off growth, pushing the country into the second part of a double-dip recession. The adjustment, which amounts to some \u20ac570 per Spaniard, mostly came from widely distributed spending cuts, with ministries cutting by an average 17% and a sharp fall in infrastructure investment. Civil servants, whose salaries were cut by 5% in 2010, were among the biggest losers: their wages were frozen again this year. Corporate taxes were tightened up, with loopholes disappearing, so that Spain's biggest companies will contribute \u20ac5.3bn to the adjustment. Montoro launched a tax amnesty, appealing to those with money hidden offshore or in the underground economy to take advantage of a one-off, no-questions-asked deal that would allow them to pay between 8% and 10% tax. Estimated revenue of \u20ac2.5bn from that tax indicates that he expects \u20ac25bn to appear in a country where up to 20% of the economy is thought to be underground. Income tax rises announced in December, with top earners hit specially hard, were expected to contribute \u20ac4bn. While Spanish electricity bills will rise by 7% and gas bills by 5%, the government steered clear of measures that would hit Spaniards directly in their pockets. The measures introduced so far, including reform of labour laws, have already damaged the popularity of Rajoy's People's party just 100 days after it took over the reins of government. Thursday's general strike came after regional elections in southern Andalucia saw the ruling PP's vote drop to 41% from 46% at the November general election when Rajoy ousted a socialist government. Rajoy blames the socialists, who had promised to leave the deficit at 6% of GDP last year, for Spain's current plight. Last year's deficit was 8.5 %. Montoro will take the budget, which does not formally come into effect until May or June, to parliament next week, where it may be altered. Economists had warned that, in order to meet the \u20ac35bn net adjustment demanded by the EU, with falling tax revenues and an economy falling into recession, the real extra adjustment in the last nine months of the year had to reach \u20ac40bn. Spaniards are upset that the EU has demanded such a fierce deficit cut over the next two years \u2013 bigger than that asked of the eurozone's bailed-out countries. While Greece must cut the deficit by 4.7% of its GDP over the next two years, Spain has to find 5.5%. Ireland has been set a 2.6 % adjustment and Portugal 2.9%.",

      "body": "<p>As leading shares ended the quarter on an upbeat note, <strong>Shire</strong> was an exception after the drugs group reported a disappointing trial result.</p> <p>The company said it would not submit a regulatory filing for its drug mesalamine as a treatment for digestive disease diverticulitis, after it proved no more effective than placebo. Shire had hoped to open up a new market for mesalamine, which is the active ingredient in its bowel drug Lialda. Analysts had been looking for $300m to $500m of extra sales for Lialda if the trials had been successful, on top of $500m currently. UBS said:</p> <blockquote> Discussions with experts led us to conclude that the diverticulitis indication could have provided a $400m extra boost to Lialda sales, but that the chance of success was extremely low. We were assuming a 10% chance of success, and had not included any sales in our profit and loss. </blockquote> <p>This is the second setback for Shire in two weeks, following news that it had withdrawn a US application for its drug to treat Fabry disease, a genetic disorder.</p> <p>The news - which comes just days after Shire revealed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/mar/22/shire-chairman-matthew-emmens-shares?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">its chairman Matthew Emmens had taken home \u00a38.5m last year </a>- sent the company's shares tumbling 98p to \u00a320.20, making it the biggest faller in the leading index.</p> <p>Despite Shire's decline, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 26.42 points higher at 5768.45, ending a three day losing streak. The index has lost 86 points over the week on renewed worries about the eurozone crisis, fears of recession in the UK and Europe, and downbeat comments on the US economy by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. But with the quarter ending, investors were comforted by EU ministers finally agreeing an \u20ac800bn firewall and Spain unveiling its austerity budget.</p> <p>Over the first three months of the year the leading UK index has climbed 3.5%, despite Greece defaulting and signs of a downturn in global economic powerhouse China. The European Central Bank's cheap loans programme has provided much of the support, helping European markets climb nearly 7% over the quarter, as measured by the FTSEurofirst 300 which recorded its best first quarter performance since 2006. Within that Germany's Dax saw its biggest first quarter rise since 1998. But they have been outpaced by America's S&amp;P 500, which has risen by around 16% since the start of the year thanks to a surge in Apple shares amid the new iPad launch, and the Nikkei 225 which is up 19%.</p> <p>Gold has climbed around 6% for the quarter, with crude oil up around 4.5% amid growing tensions with Iran. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> Whilst today's small gain means we've ended the first quarter on a positive note, there is definitely a sour taste in the mouth. January and February were really good months for the markets but March has tailed off finishing in the red by some 1.8% as concerns over the global economic picture have risen with China looking like it's slowing quicker than previously thought. </blockquote> <p>The volatile mining sector has provided support for the market as metal prices edged higher, with <strong>Antofagasta</strong> adding 30p to \u00a311.52 and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> rising 70.5p to \u00a334.46. But <strong>Randgold Resources</strong> lost 100p to \u00a353.70 as Nomura cut its recommendation from buy to neutral.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Vodafone</strong> fell 2.25p to 172.2p as the company said it was considering a number of actions following an Indian proposal to back-date tax claims on deals involving overseas businesses. Vodafone recently won a legal battle over a $2.2bn tax demand relating to its purchase of Hutchinson Whampoa's mobile assets in the country. The new proposals however have rekindled the uncertainty.</p> <p><strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> - lifted earlier in the week by reports of talks to sell a stake in the state-owned bank to Abu Dhabi - slipped 0.19p to 27.64p.</p> <p><strong>Tesco</strong> climbed 1.9p to 330p despite Morgan Stanley downgrading its recommendation from equal weight to underweight:</p> <blockquote> We believe Tesco has 'disinvested' from its UK customer proposition via price, private label quality and service since 2007. Until it is prepared to take short-term pain for long-term gain, we think it will underperform. We believe a true 're-set' is unlikely anytime soon, so downgrade to underweight. </blockquote> <p><strong>Astrazeneca</strong> edged up 0.5p to \u00a327.79 after a US court ruled its patent for the extended release version of anti-psychotic drug Seroquel is valid, meaning companies trying to sell cheaper generic versions had infringed its rights.

      "bodyText": "As leading shares ended the quarter on an upbeat note, Shire was an exception after the drugs group reported a disappointing trial result. The company said it would not submit a regulatory filing for its drug mesalamine as a treatment for digestive disease diverticulitis, after it proved no more effective than placebo. Shire had hoped to open up a new market for mesalamine, which is the active ingredient in its bowel drug Lialda. Analysts had been looking for $300m to $500m of extra sales for Lialda if the trials had been successful, on top of $500m currently. UBS said: Discussions with experts led us to conclude that the diverticulitis indication could have provided a $400m extra boost to Lialda sales, but that the chance of success was extremely low. We were assuming a 10% chance of success, and had not included any sales in our profit and loss. This is the second setback for Shire in two weeks, following news that it had withdrawn a US application for its drug to treat Fabry disease, a genetic disorder. The news - which comes just days after Shire revealed its chairman Matthew Emmens had taken home \u00a38.5m last year - sent the company's shares tumbling 98p to \u00a320.20, making it the biggest faller in the leading index. Despite Shire's decline, the FTSE 100 finished 26.42 points higher at 5768.45, ending a three day losing streak. The index has lost 86 points over the week on renewed worries about the eurozone crisis, fears of recession in the UK and Europe, and downbeat comments on the US economy by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. But with the quarter ending, investors were comforted by EU ministers finally agreeing an \u20ac800bn firewall and Spain unveiling its austerity budget. Over the first three months of the year the leading UK index has climbed 3.5%, despite Greece defaulting and signs of a downturn in global economic powerhouse China. The European Central Bank's cheap loans programme has provided much of the support, helping European markets climb nearly 7% over the quarter, as measured by the FTSEurofirst 300 which recorded its best first quarter performance since 2006. Within that Germany's Dax saw its biggest first quarter rise since 1998. But they have been outpaced by America's S&amp;P 500, which has risen by around 16% since the start of the year thanks to a surge in Apple shares amid the new iPad launch, and the Nikkei 225 which is up 19%. Gold has climbed around 6% for the quarter, with crude oil up around 4.5% amid growing tensions with Iran. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: Whilst today's small gain means we've ended the first quarter on a positive note, there is definitely a sour taste in the mouth. January and February were really good months for the markets but March has tailed off finishing in the red by some 1.8% as concerns over the global economic picture have risen with China looking like it's slowing quicker than previously thought. The volatile mining sector has provided support for the market as metal prices edged higher, with Antofagasta adding 30p to \u00a311.52 and Rio Tinto rising 70.5p to \u00a334.46. But Randgold Resources lost 100p to \u00a353.70 as Nomura cut its recommendation from buy to neutral. Elsewhere Vodafone fell 2.25p to 172.2p as the company said it was considering a number of actions following an Indian proposal to back-date tax claims on deals involving overseas businesses. Vodafone recently won a legal battle over a $2.2bn tax demand relating to its purchase of Hutchinson Whampoa's mobile assets in the country. The new proposals however have rekindled the uncertainty. Royal Bank of Scotland - lifted earlier in the week by reports of talks to sell a stake in the state-owned bank to Abu Dhabi - slipped 0.19p to 27.64p. Tesco climbed 1.9p to 330p despite Morgan Stanley downgrading its recommendation from equal weight to underweight: We believe Tesco has 'disinvested' from its UK customer proposition via price, private label quality and service since 2007. Until it is prepared to take short-term pain for long-term gain, we think it will underperform. We believe a true 're-set' is unlikely anytime soon, so downgrade to underweight. Astrazeneca edged up 0.5p to \u00a327.79 after a US court ruled its patent for the extended release version of anti-psychotic drug Seroquel is valid, meaning companies trying to sell cheaper generic versions had infringed its rights. US group Mylan said earlier this week it had begun selling versions of regular Seroquel. Analysts believe Astra needs to make an acquisition to boost its grow prospects. Liberum Capital has tipped US group Forest Laboratories as a possible target, while some believe Astra may also make a move for Amylin Pharmaceuticals, which has already rejected an offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Spirent Communications, a specialist in telecoms testing equipment, ended 1.3p higher at 160.5p despite problems at one of its customers, Blackberry maker Research in Motion. George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon said: RIM currently has a distinct Netscape, DEC, Informix - ie end of days - feel to it. RIM is the notable Spirent customer - we guestimate around 2%-3% - so Spirent's share price may get caught up in the RIM backdraft.

      "bodyText": "The Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos has conceded that the crisis-plagued country could require a third bailout only weeks after it secured a second package of rescue funds following months of hand-wringing in Brussels. Athens may have received the biggest bailout in history but another lifeline could not be ruled out, the technocratic leader said in an interview. So far, the EU and International Monetary Fund have committed a total \u20ac240bn (\u00a3200bn) to the near-bankrupt nation. \"Some form of financial assistance might be necessary but we have to work intensely to avoid such an event,\" Papademos told the Italian business daily Il Sole 24 Ore. Addressing the Greek parliament on Friday he warned of further spending cuts, saying whatever government emerged after forthcoming general elections it was vital that it prepared for the measures. \"In 2013-2014, a reduction in state spending of about \u20ac12bn is required under the new economic programme,\" Papademos told MPs in what is expected to be one of his last appearances before the 300-seat house. \"Every effort must be made to limit wasteful spending and not to further burden salaries of civil servants.\" Well-placed sources said the prospect of further aid would be \"a given\" if Greece was unable to service its debt by borrowing on international markets. Papademos, a former vice president of the European Central Bank, said even if Athens enforced all the reforms being demanded by its \"troika\" of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF, it remained far from certain that it would be able to access capital markets by 2015, when the country's latest financial support program ends. Greece has been locked out of markets since first seeking international aid in May 2010. \"It is difficult to foresee market conditions and expectations in 2015,\" said the leader. But addressing MPs, Papademos insisted that after this month's write-down of Greek debt, the cash-strapped economy would begin to rebound in 2013. The bond swap has sliced around \u20ac95bn from the country's \u20ac360bn debt with an additional \u20ac12bn expected to be erased when, completing the restructuring, coupons governed by foreign law are exchanged next week.

    "webTitle": "Eurozone ministers agree \u20ac500bn in new bailout funds", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Europe's 17 single currency governments have agreed to deliver \u20ac500bn (\u00a3418bn) in bailout funds in the hope of erecting a firewall strong enough to contain the sovereign debt crisis, placate the markets and encourage non-eurozone International Monetary Fund (IMF) members to commit a similar sum to emergency reserves. But the eurozone finance ministers, meeting in Copenhagen amid calls to erect the \"mother of all firewalls\", ditched explicit earlier proposals to keep a further \u20ac240bn in reserve for the next two years. The deal agreed conformed to German prescriptions for a minimalist bailout, a recipe the European commission described in advance as inadequate to the challenges confronting the euro. Ministers endeavoured to impress the bond markets, the Americans and the Chinese, trumpeting the agreement as worth \"more than a trillion dollars\" in the hope this will press the big IMF donors into doubling the monetary fund's reserves to a similar figure next month. The French finance minister, Fran\u00e7ois Baroin, said: \"We are now in a strong position for discussion on the IMF in April. It is a good signal.\" A statement from the eurogroup said: \"Altogether, the euro area is mobilising an overall firewall of approximately \u20ac800bn \u2013 more than $1tn.\" But that figure included \u20ac100bn in bilateral loans to Greece from EU countries in 2010, as well as \u20ac200bn to Ireland, Portugal and Greece from the temporary eurozone bailout fund, which closes next year, although those three programmes will run their course until 2015. The Copenhagen summit degenerated into acrimony and some chaos when Austria's finance minister, Maria Fekter, upstaged eurozone leaders by announcing the \u20ac800bn firewall first. Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister who has led the eurogroup for eight years and whose term expires in June, abruptly cancelled a press conference at which he was to unveil the news. The new money comes in the form of the European stability mechanism (ESM), the permanent eurozone bailout kitty, and embryonic European Monetary Fund, which starts in July. The ESM's launch has already been brought forward, and ministers agreed to speed up the process of paying in capital to get the fund fully operational within two years. Its lending capacity was capped at \u20ac500bn, as has long been planned. \"As of mid-2013, the maximum lending volume of ESM will be \u20ac500bn. The combined lending ceiling of the ESM and the EFSF [European financial stability facility] will continue to be set at \u20ac700bn,\" the statement said in reference to the three ongoing bailouts from the temporary fund. That fund totalled \u20ac440bn, leaving \u20ac240bn still available. A draft statement on Thursday said the spare \u20ac240bn would be held in reserve for emergency use, but that clause was dropped yesterday. The permanent fund's lending capacity hinges on \u20ac80bn being paid in five instalments until 2014 to retain a triple-A credit rating, meaning that it could be two years before the fund is operating fully as foreseen. But the parallel operation of the current temporary and the future permanent funds will ensure a lending capacity of \u20ac500bn, the ministers said. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany's powerful finance minister, is tipped to succeed Juncker in a post that the sovereign debt crisis has turned into one of the most crucial in the EU. But intense wrangling over how to divvy up a quartet of senior financial jobs meant those decisions were postponed. Friday's agreement represented yet another win in the long-running euro saga for Berlin in dictating the terms of the eurozone's response to the crisis. France and others had argued for a trillion-euro firewall. Germany insisted the permanent fund should not exceed \u20ac500bn and on Monday conceded the \u20ac200bn of current bailouts could run concurrently. \"The euro area made substantial progress over the past 18 months to address the challenges stemming from the sovereign debt crisis,\" the ministers declared. \"Important improvements were made to improve the governance of the euro area \u2026 robust firewalls have been established. This comprehensive strategy has paid off.\" end",

It is a good signal.\"</p> <p>A statement from the eurogroup said: \"Altogether, the euro area is mobilising an overall firewall of approximately \u20ac800bn \u2013 more than $1tn.\"</p> <p>But that figure included \u20ac100bn in bilateral loans to Greece from EU countries in 2010, as well as \u20ac200bn to Ireland, Portugal and Greece from the temporary eurozone bailout fund, which closes next year, although those three programmes will run their course until 2015.</p> <p>The Copenhagen summit degenerated into acrimony and some chaos when Austria's finance minister, Maria Fekter, upstaged eurozone leaders by announcing the \u20ac800bn firewall first. Jean-Claude Juncker, the veteran Luxembourg prime minister who has led the eurogroup for eight years and whose term expires in June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/30/euro-debt-crisis-pain-spain#block-34\" title=\"\">abruptly cancelled a press conference</a> at which he was to unveil the news.</p> <p>The new money comes in the form of the European stability mechanism (ESM), the permanent eurozone bailout kitty, and embryonic European Monetary Fund, which starts in July. The ESM's launch has already been brought forward, and ministers agreed to speed up the process of paying in capital to get the fund fully operational within two years.</p> <p>Its lending capacity was capped at \u20ac500bn, as has long been planned. \"As of mid-2013, the maximum lending volume of ESM will be \u20ac500bn. The combined lending ceiling of the ESM and the EFSF [European financial stability facility] will continue to be set at \u20ac700bn,\" the statement said in reference to the three ongoing bailouts from the temporary fund.</p> <p>That fund totalled \u20ac440bn, leaving \u20ac240bn still available. A draft statement on Thursday said the spare \u20ac240bn would be held in reserve for emergency use, but that clause was dropped yesterday.</p> <p>The permanent fund's lending capacity hinges on \u20ac80bn being paid in five instalments until 2014 to retain a triple-A credit rating, meaning that it could be two years before the fund is operating fully as foreseen. But the parallel operation of the current temporary and the future permanent funds will ensure a lending capacity of \u20ac500bn, the ministers said.</p> <p>Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Germany's powerful finance minister, is tipped to succeed Juncker in a post that the sovereign debt crisis has turned into one of the most crucial in the EU. But intense wrangling over how to divvy up a quartet of senior financial jobs meant those decisions were postponed.</p> <p>Friday's agreement represented yet another win in the long-running euro saga for Berlin in dictating the terms of the eurozone's response to the crisis. France and others had argued for a trillion-euro firewall. Germany insisted the permanent fund should not exceed \u20ac500bn and on Monday conceded the \u20ac200bn of current bailouts could run concurrently.</p> <p>\"The euro area made substantial progress over the past 18 months to address the challenges stemming from the sovereign debt crisis,\" the ministers declared. \"Important improvements were made to improve the governance of the euro area \u2026 robust firewalls have been established. This comprehensive strategy has paid off.\"</p> <p>end</p>",

      "bodyText": "The French oil company that operates the leaking North Sea gas platform is considering using a helicopter water drop to extinguish a flare that could ignite the explosive gas cloud. The news came as reports emerged that platform-owner Total was warned about the risk of a gas leak four weeks ago. The Aberdeen Press and Journal said a local union claims workers' fears about high pressure in the 13,000ft deep reservoir were \"fobbed off\" a month ago. The Department of Energy and Climate Change said: \"Total has confirmed in their latest update to the government's inspectors that the flare remains lit but observations from the latest aerial surveillance suggest that the flame appears to be reducing in size.\" Total, which originally failed to make clear that the flare was still alight, said other options to put it out included firefighting vessels and pumping nitrogen to starve the flame of oxygen. On Thursday night Total said it had traced the leak to a gas pocket in a rock formation 4km (2.5 miles) below the seabed but 1km above the gas reservoir being tapped by the Elgin platform, which was evacuated on Sunday when the leak was discovered. In an attempt to quell fears about the risks of explosion from the gas cloud which has settled above the area, it said there were now firefighting ships on standby at the edge of the two nautical mile (2.3 mile) exclusion zone. Marine experts and oil industry unions are alarmed about the dangers of the gas cloud being ignited by the flare, about 100m from the leak, if the wind changes direction in coming days. Union leaders have urged oil companies to evacuate every rig and platform within five miles of the Elgin as a precaution. Total said the wind was expected to continue blowing the gas away from the flare, which was well above the gas cloud, and predicted the flare could burn itself out within a few days. In a statement on Thursday evening, the company said the flare was burning off evaporating liquids still in the platform's system. \"As these liquids evaporate the flow of hydrocarbons to the flare will exhaust itself and the flare should burn out,\" it said. Total disputed allegations that the gas was leaking from the seabed and that it was toxic. It said the gas was escaping from the deck level of the platform, about 25m above sea level, and was natural gas. \"This means that we now know the source of the leak, we know the problem,\" a company spokesman said. \"We can now look at solving that problem as quickly as possible.
