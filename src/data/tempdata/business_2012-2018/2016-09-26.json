      "bodyText": "Ding ding ding.... the closing bell on the New York stock exchange has been rung. And the US stock market has lost almost 1%, as investors brace for tonight\u2019s clash between the two candidates to become US president. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 166 points, or 0.91%, with almost every component dropping. Banks were the big fallers (who caught a cold from the troubles at Deutsche Bank). The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq both dropped by 0.8%, following heavier losses in Europe with Britain suffering its worst day since late June. And as we covered earlier, Analysts are predicting further losses if Trump outperforms in the debate the VIX fear index has hit a two week high. Investors are betting against the Mexican Peso - anticipating a Trump victory And US, German and UK government bonds have jumped, as traders scramble for safety tonight. But now, there\u2019s nothing more that investors can do. They must just wait to see how the first presidential debate plays out. And with the polls so close, it could be a real classic.... My colleagues will be live-blogging all the action here: I\u2019ll be back in the morning to see how the markets react. Until then, good nght and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Donald Trump hasn\u2019t released a massive amount of detail about his policy platform if he becomes president. That\u2019s one reason the markets are nervous about the presidential race. But despite that, City firm Columbia Threadneedle have taken a stab at the potential impact of a Trump victory. They reckon infrastructure providers should benefit, if Trump does launch a massive programme of building more roads, bridges, and the like. But that means more borrowing, which could get expensive. Mark Burgess of Columbia explains: Trump has made some disconcerting comments regarding a lack of commitment to debt repayments. If a substantial global event like the financial crisis were to occur again, this may mean domestic debt is paid while foreign debt remains outstanding. Could this deter investors? This would be particularly unfortunate as Treasury issuance is likely to increase significantly in order to fund the various costly proposals as the US racks up larger deficits. Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago, says US election uncertainty isn\u2019t helping the dollar. He told Reuters that: \u201cMost market participants are waiting to see what comes out of the debate tonight and will take their cue from there.\u201d US Treasuries (American government debt) have rallied today, on nervousness ahead of tonight\u2019s debate. This has pushed the yield (or interest rates) on 10-year Treasury bonds down to 1.587%, from 1.6% on Friday. It\u2019s another sign that investors are looking for safety tonight. As Kim Rupert, managing director for fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco, put it: \u201cA lot of the gains in Treasuries are safe-haven trades....Stocks are also looking pretty weak with a lot of concerns about financials with Deutsche Bank.\u201d Hillary Clinton has a five point lead over Donald Trump, according to the latest weekly tracking poll from NBC News. But that follows a Bloomberg poll this morning putting the two candidates level (and Trump ahead, in a four-way fight). And polling expert Nate Silver believes it is too close to call: Stocks are still down on Wall Street, with just under an hour to go until the closing bell. The Dow is currently off 159 points, or 0.8%, at 18101 -- a level it\u2019s been hovering around for most of the day, really. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are showing similar losses. Bank shares continue to get a kicking; Goldman and JP Morgan are both down 2.5% (due to the worries over Deutsche Bank). Walt Disney is now among the fallers too, down 1.7%, following a report it might bid for Twitter. CNN aren\u2019t pulling their punches -- they predict that stock markets will probably tumble on Tuesday if Trump wins tonight\u2019s debate. Here\u2019s a flavour: Wall Street doesn\u2019t want a President Trump (with the exception of a few hedge fund managers and Trump supporters, like Carl Icahn). As the old saying goes, the market loves good news, it can deal with bad news, but it hates uncertainty. And Trump is the motherlode of uncertainty. \u201cThe typical investor just can\u2019t contemplate the possibility of a Trump victory,\u201d says Cary Leahey, chief U.S. economist at Decision Economics.... So the closer the race gets, the more worried investors become.... \u201cIf for some reason Trump puts on a presidential showing...and Clinton stumbles for whatever reason, then the market may take another reassessment,\u201d says Leahey. That\u2019s the polite way of saying, stocks are likely to fall. More here: Donald Trump\u2019s protectionist rhetoric is a particular worry for Wall Street. CNBC\u2019s Elizabeth Gurdus reports that: \u201cI think neither candidate has super market-friendly policies,\u201d Dean Curnutt, CEO of Macro Risk Advisors, said on CNBC. \u201cBoth have been reasonably anti-trade. Clinton was pulled pretty far left by Bernie Sanders. Trump\u2019s policies really resemble very little of what we typically associate with free-market Republicanism.\u201d Trump\u2019s attacks on Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen add another dollop of instability to the pot. If he wins in November, Yellen might not bank on getting a second term. Mexico\u2019s manufacturers might want to raise a glass to Donald Trump; by weakening the peso, he\u2019s made their exports much more competitive: The US dollar is already dropping against the yen, even before the two nominees take to the stage in New York. One dollar now gets you 100.29 yen in the FX market, down 0.7% compared to Friday, when your greenback was worth 101.1 yen. That won\u2019t amuse the Tokyo government much; Japan wants to weaken its currency to push inflation up. The US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico stock markets are all down today, following losses across Europe. It\u2019s more of an adjustment than a rout, though - with Wall Street losing less than 1% so far. Most European market shed less than 2% (they\u2019re all closed now) There could be a surge of money into safe-havens if Donald Trump outperforms expectations on tonight\u2019s debate, City experts say. Chris Beauchamp of IG predicts that the Japanese Yen and US government bonds (Treasuries) could both benefit: Tonight\u2019s US presidential election debate is a major event for financial markets, with risky assets likely to see significant volatility, should Trump manage to further build on the gains he has made over recent weeks. Despite significant movements towards Trump in recent polls, IG clients perceive there still to be a 62% chance of a Clinton win, according to the IG binary market. That being said, Hilary remains a somewhat uninspiring personality and there is a distinct risk that tonight\u2019s debate could see the polls tighten even further, thus driving investors towards havens such as the yen and Treasuries. Some investors are looking at the Presidential Race as a serious chance to make money. The rest are just worried about losing what they\u2019ve already got. But how do you trade, say, a Donald Trump victory? Well, Mexico\u2019s currency has emerged as a surprise proxy for the Upset To End All Upsets. When Trump does well, or Hillary Clinton has a bad day, the Mexicon peso often takes a pasting. This chart shows how the peso has weakened since April, from 17 to the $1 to almost 20/$1 today. And the pressure is getting worse -- bets against the poor old Peso have hit a record high and the cost of insuring against future losses has spiked. Trump\u2019s vow to build a wall on the Mexican border means the country is at \u201cthe sharp end of \u2018Trump risk\u2019\u201d, says Nicholas Spiro a partner at London-based Lauressa Advisory Ltd. More here: Mexican Peso Shorts at Record Ahead of U.S. Election Debate Volatility is also rising on Wall Street today as the race to the White House hots up. The CBOE Market Volatility index, or VIX (commonly known as the \u201cfear gauge\u201d) is up 1.9% today - the biggest rise in a fortnight. Reuters has more details: With just over six weeks until Election Day, some investors see a toss-up contest creating volatility in certain sectors, including health insurers, drugmakers and industrials. \u201cInvestors are acting extremely nervous with regards to the debate ... and it highlights the fact that the markets are not focusing on the health of the economy, interest rates and geopolitical events,\u201d said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are the biggest fallers on the Dow Jones industrial average today. They\u2019re both down around 1.8%, as financial stocks suffer from worries over the health of Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank. Consumer group Procter &amp; Gamble and tech giant Apple are among the few risers, but most stocks have dropped as investors await for tonight\u2019s debate (in just under 8 hours time). Over in Greece the former deputy premier Evangelos Venizelos has warned the country faces political, social and economic disintegration as financial indicators worsen and the government scrambles to push through long overdue reforms. Helena Smith reports from Athens: Venizelos, finance minister at the height of the Greek debt crisis, issued a withering assessment of the government\u2019s performance in office. In a speech to businessmen on the future of Greece at the Thessaloniki chamber of commerce and industry the politician said the country was in danger of \u201cinstitutional, economic and social collapse\u201d because the leftist-led coalition lacked a strategic plan to exit its long-running debt crisis. Instead, he claimed, ministers were working to the slogan \u201cwe are doing well and will do better\u201d and were turning a blind eye to real problems as the nation\u2019s real economy plummeted. \u201cThe government is making out as if it doesn\u2019t understand how critical things are. Its theory \u2018we are doing well and will do better\u2019 is a spring that will pop up.\u201d Venizelos, whose Pasok socialist party was in office with the main opposition conservatives until being ejected by Syriza, the radical left group led by prime minister Alexis Tsipras, spoke as the government prepared to push more creditor-mandated reforms through parliament tomorrow. Some \u20ac2.8bn worth of aid is at stake. After a summer of little progress, the aim is for parliament to legislate on the 15 milestone actions by the time the Euro Working Group meets on Thursday. The reforms, which include appointment of officials to a new privatisation fund\u2019s supervisory board, are expedient if a second bailout review is to begin and debt relief talks officially opened. Earlier on Monday the European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis said the thrice-bailed out nation had been forced to endure more punitive austerity than otherwise necessary because of Tsipras\u2019 populist pledge to end the policies when he assumed power in January 2015. \u201cPopulism doesn\u2019t solve problems. Populism creates problems,\u201d he told a conference in Riga. \u201cWe could see that in the \u2026 classical example of Greece. A new government came with a populist stance, that \u2018we don\u2019t need any austerity regimes, we will spend as much as we want\u2019 \u2026 and, in fact, Greece now implements tougher austerity measures than it would have been necessary if [reforms] of the previous government were continued at the time.\u201d Meanwhile: Britain will get no favours in the Brexit discussions, ECB president Mario Draghi hinted in his testimony to the European parliament. In his opening speech Draghi - the latest to suggest Europe will take a tough line in the negotiations - said: Regardless of the type of relationship that emerges between the European Union and the United Kingdom, it is of utmost importance that the integrity of the single market is respected. Any outcome should ensure that all participants are subject to the same rules. He added (as quoted by Bloomberg): It is very hard to imagine that any agreement that will be perceived as discriminatory against some subjects or in favor of other subjects could be a source of stability for the future of our EU. A cocktail of concerns - from the forthcoming US presidential debate to worries about Brexit to uncertainty over the outcome of the current oil producers meeting in Algeria to a new drop in Deutsch Bank shares - combined to send European markets sharply lower at the start of the trading week. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 91.39 points or 1.32% - its biggest one day percentage fall since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote - at 6818.04 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 2.19% to 10,393.71 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.8% lower at 4407.85 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.58% to 16,192.48 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 1.27% at 8711.4 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.82% to 563.59 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 143 points or 0.78%. Bookmaker Ladbrokes has sent its buzzword bingo odds for the presidential debate, and here they are: 1/10 Make America Great Again 1/5 Commander In Chief 1/2 Lying 1/2 Putin 4/6 Crooked Evens Pneumonia Evens Pennsylvania Evens Terrific 5/4 Mexico\u2019s Gonna Pay For It 6/4 Unbelievable 6/4 Reagan 6/4 Basket Of Deplorables 2/1 Racist 2/1 Founding Fathers 2/1 You\u2019re Fired 3/1 Washington Bubble 4/1 Total Loser 5/1 Brexit 5/1 Give Me A Break 10/1 Monica Lewinsky 20/1 How the Hell Should I Know 20/1 How\u2019s Your Cold 33/1 You\u2019re No Jack Kennedy Some good news for Hillary and the reverse for Trump: Back with the race to become US president, and the market\u2019s reaction ahead of the head-to-head debate, Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Stocks in the US opened lower. A number of forecasters have raised their odds of a Donald Trump presidency ahead of the first of the presidential debates Monday evening. It\u2019s Clinton the Wall Street darling versus Trump the Wall-builder. With shares near highs of the year, it seems fair to say that markets have so far discounted the probability of a Donald Trump victory. Mrs Clinton is seen as a continuation of the status quo, which hasn\u2019t exactly provided stellar growth and economic opportunity for America\u2019s poorest in the last decade. Donald Trump wants to shake up the status quo, from a market\u2019s perspective that necessarily means uncertainty. Meanwhile IG still reckons Hillary Clinton is still more likely to win the election. IG\u2019s market analyst Joshua Mahony said: Tonight\u2019s US presidential election debate is a major event for financial markets, with risky assets likely to see significant volatility, should Trump manage to further build on the gains he has made over recent weeks. Despite significant movements towards Trump in recent polls, IG clients perceive there still to be a 62% chance of a Clinton win, according to the IG binary market. That being said, Hilary remains a somewhat uninspiring personality and there is a distinct risk that tonight\u2019s debate could see the polls tighten even further, thus driving investors towards havens such as the yen and Treasuries. Asked about Deutsche Bank - whose shares have fallen sharply today - Draghi refuses to comment. And on Brexit, he says the ECB does not have an official role in the negotiations but may work in an advisory capacity. In questions Draghi repeats this theme: It is clear other policies should complement monetary policy action to reap all the benefits of the present monetary policy stance. He adds that if other policies are in place, the time for monetary policy stance to be successful would be shorter. And he admits that having low interest rates for longer would have side effects on financial stability. In his conclusion Draghi again suggests the ECB needs others - politicians particularly - to step up and do their bit for the EU: For the euro area to thrive, actions by national governments are needed to unleash growth, reduce unemployment and empower individuals, while offering essential protections for the most vulnerable.... The political commitment underpinning our single currency has been strongly reaffirmed during the crisis. Important efforts have been made. But widespread feelings of insecurity, including economic insecurity, remain a major concern. We cannot simply wait for better times: we need to renew our efforts to ensure that Economic and Monetary Union offers protection and prosperity. The ECB will do its part. On the effect of low (and indeed negative) interest rates, he said: Low rates are a symptom of the underlying economic situation. They reflect weak long-term growth trends and the protracted macroeconomic slump that has resulted from the crisis. The ECB\u2019s monetary policy has provided significant accommodation to limit the negative effects of the global and euro area-specific shocks on the economy, thereby mitigating their disinflationary impact. Nevertheless, monetary policy cannot determine the sustainable level of real interest rates in the long run, as they in turn depend on long-term growth prospects. This means that other policy actors need to do their part, pursuing fiscal and structural policies which will contribute to a self-sustaining recovery and increase the economic growth potential of the euro area, as I discussed with you in June. Mario Draghi\u2019s opening remarks to the European Parliament have been released, and the European Central Bank president said that so far the European economy has stood up to the challenge of Brexit, so far: The recovery in the euro area is expected to continue at a moderate and steady pace, but with slightly less momentum than envisaged in June. On the positive side, incoming information continues to point to the euro area economy being resilient to global and political uncertainty, notably following the UK referendum outcome. The initial impact of the vote has been contained and the strong financial market reactions, such as equity price falls, have largely reversed.... The extent to which the economic outlook will be affected depends on the timing, development and final outcome of the upcoming negotiations. So far, the euro area economy has been resilient, but due to this uncertainty our baseline scenario remains subject to downside risks. Regardless of the type of relationship that emerges between the European Union and the United Kingdom, it is of utmost importance that the integrity of the single market is respected. Any outcome should ensure that all participants are subject to the same rules. The full speech is here. A bit of US economic news, and new home sales fell less than expected in August. The Commerce Department said sales of single family homes fell 7.6% to 609,000 compared to expectations of a decline to 600,000. July\u2019s figure was revised up by 5,000 units to 659,000. Here\u2019s our US live blog of latest developments in the presidential race ahead of the Clinton-Trump debate: Back with the US debate, and Robert Shapiro of advisory firm Sonecon has looked at the economic prospects under the two candidates: Trump says he\u2019ll restore 4% annual growth, or double our current rate. But his plan to achieve it is a deceit that would actually slow growth by deporting part of the labor force and ignoring everyone\u2019s productivity. There\u2019s no silver bullet, but Hillary\u2019s program would help. Her path to citizenship and commitments to pay equity, child care assistance, universal health coverage, and more would expand the labor force. Furthermore, her pledges for tuition-free college, more support for R&amp;D, and more access to loans for young businesses would all help raise productivity. It\u2019s an easy choice. His full post is here. Elsewhere Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, is due to make his regular appearance before the European Parliament within the next half hour or so. He normally reads out his last governing council statement before being quizzed by MEPs, with Brexit of course high on the agenda. The session should be available here. As expected US markets are falling in early trading, ahead of the presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Investors are also jittery as oil producers meet in Algeria, with few expecting any positive decisions to curb the slump in the crude price although some are at least hoping for guidance that something may be done at Opec\u2019s November meeting. The uncertainty over Brexit is not helping, nor is concern about Deutsche Bank after its shares fell sharply. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 105 points or 0.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened down a similar amount. You can get psyched up for tonight\u2019s presidential debate by reading Dan Robert\u2019s list of 10 awkward question for the two candidates. Hillary Clinton should be ready for probing questions on globalisation, her counter-terrorism strategy and secrecy issues, while Donald Trump will need answers on his Middle East strategy, his suitability (or otherwise) for the most powerful job in the world, and whether he regrets anything he\u2019s said during this most remarkable campaign. It\u2019s been a bad morning on Europe\u2019s stock markets, with Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems and the looming presidential debate both hitting investor confidence. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares in London is still down around 1.25%; banks, builders and mining stocks are all leading the selloff. And European markets are deeper in the red: The news that Donald Trump is closing the gap with Hillary Clinton, ahead of today\u2019s sure-to-be bruising debate has worried investors. Trump\u2019s comments about protectionist trade policies aren\u2019t terribly popular in the City, while suggestions that NATO members should pay for the US\u2019s protection have caused angst. And the closer the race looks, the more nervous markets will get. There could still be one big shock lurking in 2016\u2019s locker. Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank, says traders are worrying about the impact of a Trump victory. Risk appetite has faded with many analysts pointing to the tightening of the US presidential elections and uncertainty around tonight\u2019s debates as the primary catalysts. Rosenstreich believes a Trump presidency could also help \u2018fringe\u2019 political groups in Europe. Donald Trump\u2019s track record of supporting anti-establishment issues and candidates, such as Brexit and Russian President Putin, will legitimize Eurosceptic groups. With the EU questioning its post-Brexit future and elections in France, Spain and Germany, empowered fringe parties could potentially redefine the geopolitical landscape. Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares are still at their lowest level since the 1980s, down 6%, despite repeatedly pledging that it hasn\u2019t been seeking help from the Berlin government. Chris Beauchamp of IG Index says Deutsche Bank is causing much alarm today. The new week has started with a bang, as the parlous state of Deutsche Bank explodes onto everyone\u2019s radar once again. The bank has been limping along for months now, but reports that Angela Merkel may not step in to rescue the bank have sent the shares tumbling, dragging banks across the UK and Europe lower as a result. The gut feeling of most investors is that Berlin would be forced to act to avoid the loss of a key institution, but gut feelings do not always make the best trades. Wall Street is expected to fall when it opens in around 75 minutes. Here are the pre-open calls (via CMC Markets): S&amp;P 500: 9 points lower at 2,155 Dow Jones: 77 points lower at 18,184 Nasdaq 100: 28 points lower at 4,830 Deutsche Bank\u2019s head of communication, Joerg Eigendorf, has just told CNBC that the bank \u201cstrongly intends\u201d to resolve its problems. Eigendorf denied that CEO John Cryan had appealed, in vain, to Angela Merkel,and reiterated that Deutsche does not need to raise fresh capital (despite the threat of a $14bn fine in the US). Here are the key points: Q: So Mr. Cryan was allegedly in Berlin and has asked for help at the Chancellery. JE: This is just wrong. At no moment of time. No point of time, John Cryan has asked the Chancellor for support in the negotiations with the Department of Justice and he doesn\u2019t intend to do that. He\u2019s very strong in that position. Q: In Berlin, some who have been speculating about the fact that you are too big to fail. There are rumours all across the capital that Deutsche Bank is just too big. So what are you answering? JE: Just look, I mean yes the share price is low. But that is not what is worrying us and that is not what we are really looking. What is really important to us is Our credit story which is very strong. Its fundamentally strong and a lot of those in the market understand if they analyse the basics and the fundamentals that we are quite strong. Look at our credit story, value add risk very low, our credit portfolio very strong, liquidity position very strong, very comfortable and the third quarter is almost over. And I can tell you today is where we are finding very comfortable. Q: Berlin is not willing to bail you guys out. So does that put you in an insecure situation? JE: Again that is pure speculation. And for us it\u2019s just not a question. Deutsche Bank strongly intends to solve its problems or its challenges by itself and we don\u2019t think about anything else. We do our homework here. We are structure of the bank. We try to get the litigation issues out of the way because this is creating this uncertainty. A lot that is out there in the market right now. It\u2019s just pure speculation and uncertainty that was created by this and this is what we try to do. And by doing our homework, we will get this. This uncertainty out of the market again. Q: And looking at the markets though they are betting against you had the share price hit a new record low. How confident are you that you have enough time actually to do your homework? JE: We are very committed and we are doing our job. We are we are out there today and doing our homework. And the speculations, again, this is as if we need something today. We are fulfilling all capital requirements comfortably right now and that is not that is just speculation for the future and we have said time and once we got through the Canadian litigation issue all of the way once we get that restructuring done, the operative strengths of the bank will be seen again and once it is seen people will then these speculations will hopefully end. Q: Just one last question. Would you exclude the capital increase in the short to medium term now? JE: Again this is just not a question for us right now. We fulfil the capital requirements. We have time to fulfil future capital requirements and that\u2019s what we are working on. The pound is on track to hit a five-week low, amid speculation that the UK could be heading for a \u2018hard Brexit\u2019. Sterling has fallen by half a cent to $1.293, which would be the lowest closing level since mid-August. Paresh Davdra, CEO and Co-Founder of RationalFX, blames a lack of communication about the government\u2019s plans for Brexit. \u201cThe recent news reports that a so called \u2018hard Brexit\u2019 seems the more likely strategy for the UK\u2019s EU departure and this has had a dramatic impact on the pound, with sterling falling to a five week low. Despite the lost ground, the pound had regained last week in reaction to unchanged interest rates from the Fed, but has slumped as comments from the Ministers in charge of Brexit suggest that the UK would push to become a part of the World Trade Organisation \u2013the strongest indication yet of divorce proceedings that forgoes prolonged negotiations for single market access with the EU. This echoes the front page of today\u2019s Financial Times, that City figures are increasingly fearful of a Hard Brexit John McFarlane, chairman of Barclays and TheCityUK lobby group summed up the mood to the FT: The danger of hard talk now is that it increases uncertainty, reduces confidence and will result in businesses triggering their exit plans from the UK. And yesterday, several business leaders including Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary criticised the government\u2019s handling of the issue. Trump and Clinton are now neck-and-neck in the race for the presidency, according to a new poll from Bloomberg. The pair are both claiming around 46% of the vote, in this latest Bloomberg Politics national poll which was conducted last week. And if two smaller parties are also included, the Republican nominee has a small leader over his Democrat rival. This suggests Trump has gained ground on Clinton in the last week, making tonight\u2019s debate, at Hofstra University in New York, even more dramatic. Here\u2019s some detail: Among likely voters under 35 years old, Clinton gets 50 percent to Trump\u2019s 40 percent, down from her 29-point margin in August in the two-way race and from her 26-point margin in June in the three-way race. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 points for top-line numbers, with 1,002 likely voters interviewed, and is higher among subgroups. It was taken Wednesday through Saturday, after Clinton took political heat for calling half of Trump\u2019s supporters \u201cdeplorables\u201d and for disclosing she had pneumonia after a video caught her falling ill at a Sept. 11 ceremony. More here: Trump, Clinton Deadlocked in Bloomberg Poll Before Key Debate The FT\u2019s Bryce Elder has explained how Deutsche Bank has been a poor investment for a long time.... (this is from the always excellent daily live chat on Alphaville) Back in the UK...the number of new mortgage approved by lenders has shrunk by 20%. The British Bankers\u2019 Association reports that 36,997 new home loans were approve in August, the lowest level since 2015. Mortgage approvals can be a good leading indicator of the direction of the housing market, so this may show that the Brexit vote has cooled demand. Here\u2019s the full story: The German government is trying to slap down speculation that Deutsche Bank might need state aid (following those reports that Angela Merkel has declined to help). Steffen Seibert, Merkel\u2019s spokesman, insists that there is no reason to speculate about this issue at all. He told reporters that: \u201cThere is no reason for such speculation as presented there and the federal government doesn\u2019t engage in such speculation.\u201d Deutsche Bank has insists that it can tackle its current problems without tapping shareholders for fresh capital, in response to today\u2019s selloff. A spokesman for the bank also denied that CEO John Cryan had asked chancellor Angela Merkel for help, to tackle the threatened $14bn fine from the DoJ. Here\u2019s the quote (via Reuters). John Cryan at no point asked the German Chancellor for the government to intervene in the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s mortgages case. \u201cDeutsche Bank is determined to resolve its challenges on its own.... There is currently no question of a capital increase. We are meeting all regulatory requirements.\u201d This is helping Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares to recover some of their earlier losses -- when they hit a record low (according to my Reuters terminal...although other data show they were lower in the 1980s) Turkey\u2019s stock market is in a spin this morning, after Moody\u2019s downgraded the country to Junk status on Friday night. The BIST 100 index of leading shares has shed 4% this morning, with almost every company losing ground. Banking shares are leading the rout, dropping by around 6%. The Turkish lira has been hit, and government bond prices are also weakening - driving up the yield (or interest rate) on debt issued by Ankara. Mike van Dulken, Head of Research at Accendo Markets, says a \u201cnasty cocktail\u201d of worries and threats are hitting shares this morning. They are: last week\u2019s dovish central bank inspired rally having run its course; jitters about tonight\u2019s Trump v Clinton debate; waning faith in this week\u2019s Algiers Oil meeting yielding anything whatsoever; German Chancellor Merkel saying no backstop for troubled Deutsche Bank (trading all-time lows), increasing sector contagion risk; City fears of a hard Brexit. He adds: Risk assets like Banks, Housebuilders and Miners are bearing the brunt of it this morning. Geopolitics appears to dominate. The financial pages of the UK newspapers are packed with Brexit stories. In the Guardian, AkzoNobel, one of Europe\u2019s biggest industrial companies, is calling for \u201cquick clarity\u201d over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU. CEO Ton B\u00fcchner says: \u201cAs a CEO, what you prefer in situations like this is quick clarity, quick stability so everybody knows the rules, everybody can adapt to the situation on the ground. \u201cAs long as the situation on the ground is unclear people don\u2019t know exactly whether big decisions are going to be right or wrong, so you get postponements [of decisions]. So for us that could be with our customers and it could be with our suppliers.\u201d The Financial Times splash on City worries that Britain is heading for a hard Brexit, and losing access to the single market. That could force more businesses to start relocating from London, to other EU cities, to maintain access to the bloc. But the Telegraph is more upbeat, reporting that City economists have upgraded their growth forecasts for this year. They say: Panic has faded rapidly among the dozens of independent economists consulted by the Treasury as strong data in the three months since the vote reassured the analysts that any shock from the vote was far less severe than first feared. Forecasts for 2016\u2019s GDP growth had been chopped to 1.5pc immediately after the 23 June ballot, but economists have reversed those downgrades and now expect growth of 1.8pc - exactly the same as they predicted before the vote. They\u2019ve also raised next year\u2019s forecasts, but still expect a serious slowdown: In July the average prediction was for growth of 0.5pc in 2017, but now it almost doubled to 0.9pc \u2013 though it remains below the 2.1pc average forecast before the vote. An early rally in the oil price has fizzled out. Brent crude had jumped by 1% early doors, having shed over 3% on Friday. But it\u2019s now down slightly at $45.80 per barrel. Investors are (once again) facing the prospect that Opec fails to agree to curb production during their meeting in Algeria. Algerian energy minister Noureddine Bouterfa raised hopes yesterday, declaring that: \u201cWe will not come out of the meeting empty-handed.\u201d Around \u00a322bn has now been wiped off the FTSE 100 this morning, with the blue-chip index currently down 88 points or 1.2%. Bloomberg\u2019s Matthew Campbell is also worried about Deutsche Bank: Shares in Deutsche Bank have now hit their lowest level in over 24 years. This morning\u2019s selloff appears to be triggered by reports that chancellor Angela Merkel won\u2019t provide any state assistance for the troubles lender. Focus Magazine also reported that Merkel has declined to lobby the US Department of Justice over that $14bn fine for misconduct. That may worry investors, as Deutsche only set aside around $6bn. Newsflash from Berlin: German business morale has hit its highest level in over two years. The IFO institute says its business climate index rose to 109.5 this month, much higher than expectations of 106.4. Ifo head Clemens Fuest says. \u201cCompanies are clearly more optimistic about the months ahead. They are also more satisfied with their current business situation. \u201cThe German economy is expecting a golden autumn.\u201d That suggests that Brexit fears have ebbed away; just in time for the US presidency to jump up the agenda... Money is flowing out of shares and into safe-haven assets this morning. This is driving up the value of German, US and UK government bonds, as investors hunker down ahead of the presidential debate. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Despite months and months of political drama one could make a fairly convincing argument for today being the real Day Zero for the US election. The first televised debate marks the point where Trump vs Clinton will be even more unavoidable than it already is, and therefore has reminded the market that the Brexit, US interest rates and China\u2019s economic slowdown aren\u2019t the only macro-issues out there to worry about. In other words, the markets have been reminded this morning that a Donald Trump presidency is still more than possible, sparking a sharp decline roughly on par with the gradual gains managed last week. The FTSE dropped 80 points to duck under 6850, while the DAX and CAC fell 1.6% and 1.8% respectively. European banking stocks are getting pummelled this morning. Deutsche Bank is worst hit, shedding 6.6% to \u20ac10.65. It is dogged by the threat of a $14bn fine from US authorities for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 crash. Lloyds Banking Group has dropped by 3%, after being downgraded to \u2018sell\u2019 by Goldman Sachs. Wall Street bank Citi has raise the possibility of a Trump victory in November to 40%, up from 35%. With the polls \u201cstarting to tighten\u201d, Citi is predicting much volatility in the foreign currency markets and precious metals prices if the Republican candidate triumphs. Citi also fears that the world economy will be hurt by the presidential race: \u201cCiti\u2019s base case is for a Clinton victory and mostly continuity in policies, which would leave U.S. and global growth expectations relatively unchanged... \u201cBut a Trump victory is a wild card and Citi expects this, among lingering uncertainties from Brexit and elsewhere, may cap the prospects for global growth to pick up in the remainder of the year.\u201d 2016 has been a year of shocks, but could November\u2019s presidential election be the biggest one yet? Mike Bell of JP Morgan reckons Trump is a stronger candidate than many people believe: Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says that the debate also sent shares down in Asia (where the Tokyo market shed 1%) We\u2019re starting the week in a slight risk-off mood, with Asian equities soggy, currency markets quiet, 10-year Treasury yields down a bit at 1.62% (the average of the month so far) and oil slightly higher ahead of the informal oil producers meeting. FXTM chief market strategist Hussein Sayed says investors are wondering how to prepare for the election on November 8th. Monday\u2019s US presidential debate will probably break a new record, not in the S&amp;P 500, but the number of viewers which according to media analyst could reach over 100 million Americans, surpassing Carter-Reagan debate in 1980 which attracted 80.6 million viewers. With Donald Trump closing the gap with Hillary Clinton in latest polls, the debate is becoming more interesting than any other TV show. America\u2019s direction, achieving prosperity and securing America are the three major topics at the first presidential debate. Investors are becoming increasingly concerned on how to tweak their portfolios before November 8. Nasaq\u2019s Biotech index plunged 4.5% in two days (24-25 Aug) in one tweet from Hillary Clinton criticising the recent price hikes on EpiPens, which suggest that investors and portfolio managers are seriously considering having different asset allocation strategies on the outcome of the election. However, I still believe that a Trump win will be perceived as a negative factor to the overall market. European stock markets are falling in early trading, as the City\u2019s attention turns to the looming clash between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. In London, the FTSE 100 index shed 1% at the open, and is now down 80 points at 6829 (updated). The French and German markets are showing similar losses, amid signs that the presidential debate could be particularly brutal. The presidential election is now the biggest worry in the financial markets, with investors wonder whether 2016 will end with Trump preparing to succeed Barack Obama. The polls still put Clinton ahead, but there\u2019s real uncertainty about the outcome. It became clear last night that both sides are preparing for a dirty fight tonight, when the bell rings at 9pm in New York. The Queensberry Rules don\u2019t carry much weight when the White House is up for grabs, as my colleague David Smith explains: Trump\u2019s campaign manager did not rule out the prospect of the nominee getting personal onstage at Hofstra University in New York by summoning the ghosts of Bill Clinton\u2019s sex life, insisting that the Republican candidate had \u201ca right to defend himself\u201d. The two camps traded threats over who would be in the debate audience. After Clinton\u2019s team confirmed that it had offered a front row seat to billionaire Trump critic Mark Cuban, Trump responded that he might invite Gennifer Flowers, a former model who had an extramarital encounter with Bill Clinton in the 1980s. On Sunday, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta described Trump\u2019s reaction as \u201cto dive in the sewer and go for a swim\u201d, although the Republican candidate\u2019s running mate, Mike Pence, denied that Flowers would be present. Bob Schieffer, a venerable broadcaster who has moderated presidential debates, commented on CBS: \u201cThose kinds of things are beneath the dignity of the office that these two people are running for. I think they both would do well to think about that.\u201d Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit reckons Trump could do better than expected.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There are three key questions in the City this morning; could oil producers agree an output deal soon? could Donald Trump become US president? What\u2019s happening with Brexit? Over in Algeria, energy ministers are gathering for a two-day meeting of the International Energy Forum. That\u2019s an opportunity for Opec members to have a behind-the-scenes chat about a potential deal to cut, or at least freeze output. Few observers expect a breakthrough this week, but there\u2019s the possibility of building towards an agreement at the next Opec meeting, in November. European investors are also bracing for the first US presidential election debate, which kicks off on Monday night in the US (so 2am Tuesday in the UK). Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will trade blows before a massive global audience, on issues such as national security, healthcare, immigration...and each other\u2019s ability to carry out the most powerful job in the world. It could be a truly decisive moment in the race to the White House, as Bloomberg explains: The first of three debates promises to be a national sensation, contrasting two vastly different New Yorkers who are recognized around the world. Clinton, known for her extensive experience in government, is more comfortable discussing substantive issues than pitching her candidacy, and Trump excels as a self-promoter and an unsparing critic of his adversaries. Meanwhile back home, Brexit still means Brexit..... which means everyone\u2019s still wondering what\u2019s actually going on. This lack of clarity is now hurting Britain\u2019s financial services industry, as the threat of losing \u2018passporting rights\u2019 to the EU lingers. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Optimism dropped for the third consecutive quarter in the three months to September, according to the research jointly produced by the CBI business lobby group and the accountancy firm PwC. It marked the longest run of deteriorating sentiment since the first quarter of 2009, when the global financial system was in the midst of a deep and prolonged crisis. The biggest drop in confidence was among finance houses, building societies and investment managers, and less so among banks. Optimism was broadly stable among life and general insurance providers. Also coming up... Mario Draghi, ECB president, is testifying at the European Parliament this afternoon (at 3pm BST). We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank cannot be surprised that we\u2019ve reached the point where its share price can fall 7.5% in a day, seemingly on something as innocuous as a magazine report stating that chancellor Angela Merkel doesn\u2019t fancy the idea of state-sponsored bailout. Merkel\u2019s reported stance should surprise nobody. There are elections in Germany next year and there are no votes in saying you would be prepared to bail out bonus-hungry bankers or wire state funds to the US to satisfy the demands of the Department of Justice. Nor is it sensible for a German politician to lobby US counterparts for soft treatment for a pet bank; any attempt is likely to backfire. Thus it is hardly a revelation that Berlin is telling Deutsche that it is on its own as it attempts to reduce the DoJ\u2019s initial demand for $14bn to settle allegations of mis-selling mortgage securities. If a true crisis arrived \u2013 meaning Deutsche was unable to raise funds from shareholders \u2013 it is still safe to assume Merkel would act. She would choose the humiliating, but pragmatic, option of a bailout. The cause of Monday\u2019s mini-panic, therefore, may simply be the market\u2019s deepening realisation of the size of the hole Deutsche is in. A final demand from the DoJ for $4bn would probably be tolerable, but $8bn-plus would require fresh capital, analysts roughly agree. Deutsche, after all, is worth only $18bn these days. But an equal uncertainty is the time it will take to reach a settlement. This saga could still run for months, and Deutsche\u2019s negotiating position is weak as it appeals for \u201cfair\u201d treatment. A sum of $5bn could be the difference between relative relief and full-blown crisis. Put like that, it\u2019s a wonder Deutsche\u2019s share price doesn\u2019t rise or fall 7.5% on most days of the week. And, it hardly needs saying, it is disgraceful that one of the world\u2019s most important banks wasn\u2019t ordered to iron-clad its balance sheet years ago. Lesson for Monarch and Greybull: move faster Blame Twitter. Or, at least, blame those planespotters who announced on social media that someone had lined up aircraft to make incoming flights to the UK at the same time that Monarch flights were due to depart from holiday destinations. Cue speculation that Monarch could be in financial trouble. As it happens, the planespotters were onto something, just not the whole story. It seems the Civil Aviation Authority had indeed arranged for planes to recover stranded passengers should Monarch be unable to renew its operating licence by the end of this month. But Monarch\u2019s owner, Greybull Capital, was working on a refinancing to secure the licence and make the regulator\u2019s efforts redundant. One can understand, of course, why Monarch is miffed that the CAA\u2019s contingency planning became public knowledge. It says its business is \u201ctrading well\u201d and will report \u00a340m of top-line profit this year. Eleventh-hour panic could be unhelpful to the attempt to raise a \u201csignificant\u201d investment. One wishes Greybull and Monarch success, but there\u2019s no point in trying to shift blame onto the CAA, which seems only to have done its job. In the age of Twitter, the moral of the tale is to get your deal done in good time. Aldi is down but far from out Have the old-school supermarkets finally halted the Aldi train? Well, they\u2019ve slowed it, albeit only by deploying price-cutting tactics that have impoverished their own shareholders. Aldi\u2019s operating profits last year fell 1.8% to \u00a3256m but that masks a steeper decline in the German chain\u2019s profit margins in the UK over the past three years. That figure was 5.2% in 2013, slipped to 3.8% in 2014 and was 3.3% last year. The bad news for the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury and Morrisons is that even forcing Aldi back to 3% would not overthrow the economics of discounting. The German owners, one suspects, would be happy to feast on 3% for eternity. The old guard can claim a moral victory in the sense that Aldi is planning a \u00a3300m refit of its stores to make them less tatty. Yet the sheer number of Aldis is the problem \u2013 and, on that front, the official ambition is still 1,000 by 2022, an increase from 659 today. Only if that target is abandoned, which might require Aldi\u2019s margins to slip towards 1%, can the big boys claim real success. In the meantime, expect the refrain from Tesco et al to be familiar: we\u2019re \u201cinvesting\u201d in our customers by giving them lower prices but we can\u2019t tell you, dear shareholder, when you will harvest the returns.

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is to fight back against Amazon with a one-hour grocery delivery service in London. The supermarket, which recently bought Argos as part of its efforts to see off the American online retail specialist, has developed an app called Chop Chop, through which shoppers can order up to 20 items to be delivered from a local store within an hour. Since June, Sainsbury\u2019s has been testing the service in Wandsworth, south London, with groceries delivered Deliveroo-style using bicycles. It is now being extended across south-west and central London areas including Chelsea, Westminster, Fulham, Battersea, Southwark, Wandsworth and Wimbledon. The supermarket first offered a delivery service by bicycle more than 130 years ago, but the latest effort is part of its bid to fight back against the encroachment of a very modern phenomenon. Amazon began offering frozen and chilled foods via its Prime Now one-hour delivery service in Birmingham nearly a year ago, and now offers fruit and vegetables for one-hour delivery in a number of cities including London, Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool. In June, Amazon launched its Fresh grocery delivery service, which offers fresh fruit, vegetables and meat as well as other kitchen cupboard staples, in London and Surrey. It kicked off the service after Morrisons agreed to supply Amazon with groceries. The arrival of Amazon has prompted the major supermarkets to up their game by trialling new delivery services. Sainsbury\u2019s is also testing a same-day delivery service in Streatham and Richmond in London, and Brookwood in Surrey. Customers who order by 12 noon can get their shopping delivered within six hours. Tesco is also trialling same-day delivery in a few locations. Sainsbury\u2019s said it had recruited a team of 40 cyclists and grocery pickers, all direct employees, to support its one-hour delivery service. Orders will be picked by Sainsbury\u2019s staff in either the Wandsworth or Pimlico stores and customers pay via the app, which they can also use to track their delivery. If a product isn\u2019t in stock, the store will call the customer to ask if they want a substitute item. Jon Rudoe, Sainsbury\u2019s director of digital and technology, said: \u201cSpeed of delivery is important to some customers, so we have brought back our bicycle service to test demand further. \u201cIn Wandsworth, customers are using the new one-hour delivery service to buy forgotten items, or emergency goods when they cannot leave their home or have invited guests on the spur of the moment. \u201cIf it proves popular, we might introduce it to other areas of London. It complements our same-day delivery service, which is available at selected London postcodes through our online groceries service.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Aldi will continue to cut prices to ensure it is cheaper than the traditional supermarkets, even if that means crashing into the red, its UK boss has pledged. The discount supermarket chain has revealed its second consecutive year of falling profits after being forced to cut prices in the face of a price war partly driven by the success of Aldi and its German discount rival Lidl. Operating profit dropped 1.8% to \u00a3255.6m in the 2015 calendar year as the German retailer said it had cut prices on about 30% of products last year. Sales rose 12% to \u00a37.7bn Aldi as opened 65 more stores. Matthew Barnes, Aldi\u2019s chief executive for the UK and Ireland, said he had already cut prices on 30% of products this year and was determined to keep them below the likes of Asda, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco and Morrisons, even \u201cif losses are an inevitable consequence\u201d. He said: \u201cRegardless of what competitors may say or do, our price advantage will be maintained and our customers will always pay the lowest grocery prices in the UK.\u201d Aldi does not release like-for-like sales figures, which measure the pace of growth at established stores, but Barnes said that stores that had been open more than a year continued to record growth. He admitted growth had slowed, but said this was down to the group opening third, fourth or seventh stores in areas where its older outlets were very busy. He said there had so far been no impact, in terms of rising costs or slowing sales, from the Brexit vote. Dave McCarthy, an analyst at HSBC, said: \u201cThe discounters are not having it all their own way. On the figures released today, it seems that Aldi is feeling some pressure from increased price competition by the big four [supermarkets].\u201d Barnes said the price war was \u201ca real challenge for us and everybody\u201d, and profit margins might fall further but he couldn\u2019t foresee a scenario in which Aldi would move into losses in Britain. He said Aldi\u2019s simple and efficient operations meant it had lower costs and so could cope with lowering prices more effectively than its bigger rivals. The group, which has 659 stores in the UK, plans to open a total of 70 stores this year. It will open a new distribution centre in Cardiff and 70 more stores next year, as well as refurbishing 100 stores. Aldi plans to spend \u00a3300m over the next four years to make its no-frills stores easier and more pleasant to shop, expanding fridge space for fresh fruit, vegetables and meat and improving the look of its baby and alcoholic drinks sections \u2013 all areas which have seen double-digit growth. Fruit and vegetable sales rose 18%, and fresh meat rose 20% last year as Aldi expanded its ranges. UK supermarket sales rose 0.3% in the 12 weeks to 11 September as warm weather and Britain\u2019s success at the Olympics and Paralympics increased spending on alcohol. Aldi, which sponsors Team GB, and Lidl continued to perform better than their UK rivals as sales rose 11.6% and 9.5%, respectively. The retailers are outpacing the market, despite selling a limited amount of products online, one of the fastest-growing grocery markets. Barnes said Aldi\u2019s experiment with selling wine and non-food items was going well and the company was looking at extending into new areas. But he said: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t include groceries at the moment.\u201d",

      "body": "<p> More needs to be done to combat financial crime, a senior lawyer at HSBC has said as he called for global collaboration over the rules imposed on banks to keep \u201cbad actors\u201d out of the financial system.<br></p> <p>Stuart Levey, HSBC\u2019s chief legal officer, said worldwide agreement over the rules would reduce the risk that banks refuse to do business with legitimate customers for fear of being punished by regulators.</p> <p>A former official at the US Treasury, Levey told a conference in Geneva: \u201cPut simply, the way we do financial crime compliance is outdated. It is neither as efficient nor effective as it could be at protecting the financial system from abuse and preventing financial crime.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two countervailing forces that provide us with a real opportunity to drive forward meaningful change in this area. On one hand there is a deepened policy and political commitment to combat financial crime and preserve the integrity of the financial system. On the other, there is the growing policy concern about the unintended consequence of financial exclusion that is resulting from robust pursuit of these objectives without great enough precision.\u201d</p> <p>Levey, in his first speech since joining HSBC four years ago, said governments and private sectors were using their own financial data to try to combat crime but were not working together .

      "bodyText": "More needs to be done to combat financial crime, a senior lawyer at HSBC has said as he called for global collaboration over the rules imposed on banks to keep \u201cbad actors\u201d out of the financial system. Stuart Levey, HSBC\u2019s chief legal officer, said worldwide agreement over the rules would reduce the risk that banks refuse to do business with legitimate customers for fear of being punished by regulators. A former official at the US Treasury, Levey told a conference in Geneva: \u201cPut simply, the way we do financial crime compliance is outdated. It is neither as efficient nor effective as it could be at protecting the financial system from abuse and preventing financial crime. \u201cThere are two countervailing forces that provide us with a real opportunity to drive forward meaningful change in this area. On one hand there is a deepened policy and political commitment to combat financial crime and preserve the integrity of the financial system. On the other, there is the growing policy concern about the unintended consequence of financial exclusion that is resulting from robust pursuit of these objectives without great enough precision.\u201d Levey, in his first speech since joining HSBC four years ago, said governments and private sectors were using their own financial data to try to combat crime but were not working together . He called for the Financial Action Task Force \u2013 an intergovernmental organisation \u2013 to create global roles allowing legal protections when information is shared and ensure that secrecy and privacy laws do not stop information being shared. HSBC has been battling to restore its reputation after it was fined \u00a31.2bn by the US authorities in 2012 for breaches of money laundering rules and it has since emerged that George Osborne, the then chancellor, intervened to argue that prosecuting Britain\u2019s biggest bank could lead to a \u201cglobal financial disaster\u201d. It has also been embroiled in revelations, in the Guardian and other publications, that its Swiss arm helped customers avoid tax. Levey said rules to combat financial crime had unintended consequences such as banks \u201cde-risking\u201d \u2013 pulling out of countries or business sectors. \u201cDe-risking is being applied more and more widely as an alternative to managing risk. There are various reasons for that: the basic desire of reputable financial institutions not to facilitate illicit conduct, the challenge of identifying the individual bad actors, a weighing of the commercial benefit verses the cost of compliance and, of course, fear of enforcement,\u201d said Levey. \u201cThere is a heightened imperative to keep bad actors out of the financial system in order to promote security and also an imperative as a matter of economic policy to mitigate the unintended consequences of our efforts. If we do not collaborate better, we risk being one step behind in our efforts to keep illicit actors out of the system while also exacerbating the problem of financial exclusion.\u201d Banks, including HSBC, have been facing scrutiny of the way they have pulled back from a range of services to countries such as Somalia and individuals, such as MPs. Earlier this year, Levey criticised the US for asking European banks to do more business with Iran while Washington was restricting American financial firms from doing the same. In his speech on Monday he said he said that the sanctions against Iran - imposed in 2006 and lifted this year - had worked, leaving the country isolated and affecting its economy.",

The biggest faller is InterContinental Hotels, down 142p or 4% to \u00a331.43 after Morgan Stanley cut its recommendation from equal weight to underweight on worries about the outlook for the US. The bank\u2019s analysts said: IHG has outperformed peers year to date (in US dollars) and now trades in line despite its weaker revenue per available room /system growth. Meanwhile, multiple signals are flashing that the US hotel cycle is peaking. We cut RevPAR forecasts, partly offset by an assumed $500m buyback, but IHG looks fully valued so we move underweight. IHG has enjoyed a strong re-rating. [It] has an attractive and resilient business model, with an attractive 5.6% free cash flow yield, and M&amp;A is a theme, but it has historically traded at a discount to peers, partly as its RevPAR and net system growth have underperformed. ... meanwhile there are multiple red flags over the US hotel cycle ... US RevPAR growth has been slowing for some time (2014 8.3%, 2015 6.4%, year to date 2.7%), and we think it will weaken further given declining occupancy, anaemic rate growth, accelerating supply growth, one-fifth of submarkets in RevPAR decline, \u2018compression nights\u2019 analysis suggesting Airbnb now having an impact, and independent hotels outperforming brands. If we match these occupancy/RevPAR trends to the last two cycles, IHG shares are holding up much better. IHG is a quality operator, but when RevPAR turns, all hotel stocks de-rate sharply, which in the last downturn was to 8-9 times EBITDA (versus IHG currently on 12 time 2017e). M&amp;A speculation may continue to provide support, but we think that IHG sees itself as more of a buyer than a seller, and it no longer owns \u2018trophy\u2019 assets. Overall the FTSE 100 is currently down 81.03 points at 6828.40, with banks under pressure. UK mortgage approvals came in at their lowest level since January 2015 in August, while in Europe Deutsche Bank shares hit a record low after costly US litigation claims and reported comments from German chancellor Angela Merkel ruling out state aid. Barclays is 4.9p lower at 166.5p and Royal Bank of Scotland is down 3.5p at 179.1p. In addition Lloyds Banking Group, down nearly 3% at 54.34p, was hit by a sell note from Goldman Sachs which said it faced increased competition from HSBC and challenger banks with a decline in its mortgage market share. The mortgage approval figures have also left housebuilders lower, with Taylor Wimpey down 6p at 149.5p and Barratt Developments 17.4p lower at 479.8p. Moving higher is Micro Focus, up 18p to \u00a321.42 as UBS raised its target price from \u00a320.90 to \u00a324.20. Commenting on the market, Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: European markets have started the week lower, following Asian markets down, despite a slight recovery in oil prices. The rally in markets started to come unstuck on Friday after investors became significantly more bearish about the prospect of any OPEC deal, with short positions escalating sharply. While oil prices have bounced slightly this morning, on hopes that Saudi Arabia may be prepared to cut output at a later date, fears are growing that oversupply in the oil market will subdue prices for the foreseeable future. Possibly the most significant risk event for markets this year, the US election is already compelling and tonight\u2019s first televised US Presidential debate is likely to prove must-watch TV. So far, the only markets and sectors to pay much attention to the upcoming election are US healthcare stocks and Mexican assets - but with a little over a month before November\u2019s vote, investors need to start trying to establish what the result might mean for markets more widely.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the big split that\u2019s hit the headlines. No, not Brangelina, nor even Mary Berry and Bake Off. This one involves Sports Direct and Dave Forsey, who quit as chief executive of Mike Ashley\u2019s retail group after unrelenting criticism of the working conditions for its staff. Unpopular chairman Keith Hellawell remains in place. Meanwhile, Forsey is replaced by \u2026 Mike Ashley (who most people assumed ran the business anyway). This at least might help appease shareholders who wanted Ashley to become more accountable. But the company still needs to find a permanent finance director, as well as more external directors to challenge the existing team, so the search to beef up the board should continue this week. Perhaps it could call on Transline, the employment agency which supplies workers for the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse, to help find the right people. After all, Transline\u2019s Jenni Hardy was named as Yorkshire\u2019s Rising Star at the Barclays Celebrating Women in Business Awards at the end of June. She had certainly risen into a position of prominence by then: earlier that month, she was one of the Transline executives at a select committee whose performance led chair Iain Wright to accuse the company of deliberately misleading MPs, a charge it denies. Brexit dampens foreign holidaymaking spirit The pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote clearly put a few British holidaymakers off travelling abroad, according to official figures last week. UK visitors going overseas spent \u00a33.55bn, down 1% on a year earlier, said the Office for National Statistics. But by the same token spending by foreign visitors to the UK rose by 2%. Whether this trend continues will be one of the questions asked of travel companies reporting results this week. Cruise company Carnival reported strong trading at June\u2019s half-year figures, and said bookings for the rest of the year were ahead of 2015. Another sign of confidence before this week\u2019s third-quarter update came with news it had ordered two new liners, both bigger than any in its existing fleet. Of course, it is not just Brexit which has caused uncertainty for travel companies \u2013 terrorist attacks and concerns about consumer spending are also factors. Even so, Tui is expected to report a 10% rise in full-year earnings, with investors keen to hear how it plans to use the \u20ac1.1bn from the sale of its Hotelbeds business earlier this year, as well as any updates on partnerships for its Tuifly airline. Also reporting this week is Thomas Cook. Argos: as mindblowing as coconut flakes \u201cGently blow their minds,\u201d says a Sainsbury\u2019s advert suggesting adding coconut flakes to chicken stir-fry. More minds were probably blown by the idea of the supermarket splashing out \u00a31.4bn to buy Home Retail Group, owner of Argos and home furnishings business Habitat. Now the deal is done, Sainsbury\u2019s wants to double the number of Argos outlets in its supermarkets by Christmas, and introduce Habitat into its stores at the end of the month for the first time. On Wednesday chief executive Mike Coupe will have a chance to update investors on how these plans are progressing as he unveils the company\u2019s second quarter figures. Analysts at Deutsche Bank predict a 0.8% fall in Argos like-for-like sales before the takeover, saying: \u201cWhile consumer spend does not appear to have been impacted by Brexit, it\u2019s likely that employee engagement and hence business performance suffered in the period of uncertainty pre-completion of the acquisition.\u201d Of course, the supermarket sector continues to face intense competition and cut-throat pricing, with the discounters Aldi and Lidl still gaining market share. So Deutsche expects a 1.9% fall in Sainsbury\u2019s like-for-like sales for the quarter or a 0.9% fall including new space.",

This one involves Sports Direct and Dave Forsey, who quit as chief executive of Mike Ashley\u2019s retail group after unrelenting criticism of the working conditions for its staff. Unpopular chairman Keith Hellawell remains in place.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Forsey is replaced by \u2026 Mike Ashley (who most people assumed ran the business anyway). This at least might help appease shareholders who wanted Ashley to become more accountable.</p> <p>But the company still needs to find a permanent finance director, as well as more external directors to challenge the existing team, so the search to beef up the board should continue this week.</p> <p>Perhaps it could call on Transline, the employment agency which supplies workers for the retailer\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse, to help find the right people. After all, Transline\u2019s Jenni Hardy was named as Yorkshire\u2019s Rising Star at the Barclays Celebrating Women in Business Awards at the end of June. She had certainly risen into a position of prominence by then: earlier that month, she was one of the Transline executives at a select committee whose performance led chair Iain Wright to accuse the company of deliberately misleading MPs, a charge it denies.</p> <h2>Brexit dampens foreign holidaymaking spirit</h2> <p>The pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote clearly put a few British holidaymakers off travelling abroad, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/23/spending-by-visitors-to-uk-tourism-rose-2-per-cent-in-july\">official figures last week</a>.</p> <p>UK visitors going overseas spent \u00a33.55bn, down 1% on a year earlier, said the Office for National Statistics.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s 145,000 pubs, clubs, hotels and restaurants sold less beer than supermarkets and off-licences last year \u2013 for the first time since industry records began. Of the 44m hectolitres (7.74bn pints) of beer sold in the UK during 2015, 51% was sold in the off-trade, which is dominated by large supermarkets, according to the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA). The remaining 49% was sold through pubs, clubs and other licensed premises. Venues where drinkers can buy and consume beer have been steadily losing ground to supermarkets for many years. This is due to being unable to compete with aggressive promotions, especially on popular lager brands. In 2000, more than two-thirds of beer was drunk in pubs and other on-trade locations, while the figure was almost 80% in 1990. This weekend, Tesco was selling \u201cslab\u201d packs containing 18 cans of Stella Artois for \u00a314, equivalent to about \u00a31 a pint, while Asda was offering a similar multipack of 20 Carlsberg cans for \u00a310, equivalent to 65p a pint. According to the BBPA, the average pub price of a pint of draught lager is in a range between \u00a32.40 and \u00a34.70 \u2013 38% higher than a decade earlier. A pint of bitter has seen similar rises, up from \u00a31.80-\u00a32.56 in 2006 to \u00a32.05-\u00a33.90 this year. As well as more drinkers opting to buy supermarket beer to drink at home, changing tastes in pubs and bars have also had an impact on beer sales in recent years. The popularity of wine has been steadily building, while cider and alcopops have fluctuated in and out of fashion, on each occasion taking market share from traditional beer choices. Within pubs, there has also been winners and losers among the different types of beers on tap. The BBPA figures were published on Monday in a new statistical handbook. This showed that draught lager still dominates, accounting for 27.9% of UK beer sales last year, though this figure has fallen from 33.4% a decade earlier. Sales of cask ale have held up well, rising from 7.3% of all beer sales in 2010 to 8.2% five years later. Overall, the amount of beer drunk in the UK last year was 44m hectolitres and has remained close to that level for the last four years. Before that, beer consumption declined by more than 12% between 2006 and 2009, due to factors including increased duty, the smoking ban in pubs and shrinking disposable incomes. The number of pubs in Britain, however, has not stopped declining. There were just 50,800 public houses opening their doors last year, down from 58,200 a decade earlier. Latest figures suggest the average Briton drinks the equivalent of 67.7 litres (119 pints) a year, slightly less than the European average of 72 litres. It is also considerably less than the 107 litres a head consumed in Germany and the 144 litres a head consumed in the Czech Republic. The BBPA called on the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to repeat George Osborne\u2019s surprise cut to beer duty three years ago to boost the pub trade. It said: \u201cDuty is 54% higher than it was in 2000, despite recent cuts. Much more work needs to be done to cut beer duty in the UK, still a staggering 14 times that of Germany.\u201d",
