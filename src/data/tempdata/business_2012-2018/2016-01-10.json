An outlet in Doncaster opens later this week, followed by one in Hedon near Hull a week later. Sainsbury\u2019s is also opening a second Leeds outlet and planning to complete its first newbuild store in Bransholme, Hull, in March. Beyond that, planning permission has already been sought in at least four other locations including Penketh near Warrington, Cleckheaton near Bradford, Warsop near Mansfield and Garston in Liverpool. The likely extension of the trial comes after the chain is thought to have enjoyed good trading over Christmas.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest supermarkets will reveal a slide in Christmas sales this week, underlining the pressure placed on the industry by changing shopping habits and the growth of discounters Aldi and Lidl. The grocery market will be in the spotlight as Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons and Tesco report on their performance during the vital festive period. Sainsbury\u2019s shareholders will be particularly interested in the trading updates as they consider whether to support the company\u2019s plan to bid for Home Retail Group, the owner of Argos. Analysts have warned that a bid for Argos could distract Sainsbury\u2019s, which has outperformed its closest rivals in recent years. The supermarket is planning to launch an improved takeover bid for Home Retail worth more than \u00a31bn, and is seeking to make an offer attractive enough be taken seriously while winning the support of its own shareholders. Sainsbury\u2019s is expected to reveal a 0.7% fall in sales at established stores in the three months to the end of December. That compares with a 2% slide in the nine weeks to 3 January expected at Morrisons, which will be the first of the listed chains to report on Tuesday. Tesco is expected to be a Christmas loser, with underlying sales down by between 2% and 3% in the three months to the end of November, and slightly better than that over Christmas. Asda, the other member of the so-called \u201cbig four\u201d, has cranked up the pressure on its rivals by committing another \u00a3500m to cutting prices. The Leeds-based chain, which is owned by Walmart, experienced a 3.5% drop in sales during the Christmas period, according to estimates by analysts. On Tuesday, market share figures will be released by Kantar Worldpanel showing which chains gained or lost market share over the key trading period. Waitrose has already revealed a 1.4% fall in sales in the six weeks to 2 January; the upmarket grocer said record sales in the three days before Christmas were offset by a very slow run-up to New Year\u2019s Eve. Despite this decline, managing director Mark Price predicted the chain would gain market share. The Co-op is understood to have enjoyed underlying sales growth at its convenience stores over Christmas. It said sales of mince pies soared by 37%, while prosecco sales were up 1.4%. Steve Murrells, retail chief executive at the Co-operative Group, said: \u201cWe witnessed a strong trading performance across the key festive trading weeks. And it\u2019s clear from our sales data that convenience shopping was in the ascendency this Christmas, with more customers opting to shop little and often.\u201d However, discounters Aldi and Lidl are likely to have been the biggest winners over Christmas, with both chains maintaining double-digit sales growth \u2013 a stark contrast to the performance of the \u201cbig four\u201d. Home Retail, which also owns Homebase, is scheduled to report its third-quarter figures on Thursday. Sainsbury\u2019s announced last week that it had made an approach in November to buy the retailer with cash and shares. Analysts believe Sainsbury\u2019s could afford to pay between \u00a31.3bn and \u00a31.4bn for Home Retail because of potential efficiencies that could be made by joining the two groups. This would include between \u00a3100m and \u00a3150m from closing Argos stores and instead opening concessions within Sainsbury\u2019s supermarkets. Analysts at Exane said that Sainsbury\u2019s could justify paying up to \u00a31.3bn, or 160p a share, for Home Retail, whereas Investec said the group could be worth \u00a31.45bn. However, some Home Retail shareholders, such as Richard Buxton at Old Mutual Global Investors, have said they will not accept less than \u00a31.6bn, or 200p per share. One of Sainsbury\u2019s tasks will be to bring onside its largest shareholder, the Qatari Investment Authority (QIA). The QIA has always made clear that it does not wish to pour more money into the supermarket group. However, it also does not want its 25.1% share to be diluted. If Sainsbury\u2019s issues new shares as part of any deal, the Qataris will either have to buy more or see their stake diminish. If the QIA is uneasy about new shares being issued, Sainsbury\u2019s chairman David Tyler might seek instead to fund the entire deal with cash and the proceeds from a recently drawn down \u00a31.15bn credit facility. Sainsbury\u2019s could also raise \u00a3150m to \u00a3200m by selling off the Homebase chain. Sainsbury\u2019s has until 2 February to make a further offer or walk away, under the City\u2019s takeover rules. The supermarket group\u2019s share price has slumped 6% to 242p since it was forced to reveal its bid last Tuesday. In contrast, shares in Home Retail have risen almost 40%.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Over the last couple of decades, China has undergone profound change and is often cited as an economic growth miracle. Day by day, however, the evidence becomes increasingly clear the probability of a severe economic and financial downturn in China is on the cards. This is not good news at all for Australia. The country is heavily exposed, as China comprises Australia\u2019s top export market, at 33%, more than double the second (Japan at 15%). A considerable proportion of Australia\u2019s current and future economic prospects depend heavily on China\u2019s current strategy of building its way out of poverty while sustaining strong real GDP growth. To date, China has successfully pulled hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty and into the middle class through mass provision of infrastructure and expansion of housing markets, alongside a powerful export operation which the global economy has relied upon since the 1990s for cheap imports. Though last week\u2019s volatile falls on the Chinese stock markets alongside a weakening yuan sent shockwaves through the global markets, Australia\u2019s exposure lies much deeper within the Chinese economy. The miracle is starting to look more and more fallible as it slumps under heavy corporate debts and an over-construction spree which shall never again be replicated in our lifetimes or that of our children. As of the second quarter of 2015, China\u2019s household sector debt was a moderate 38% of GDP but its booming private non-financial business sector debt was 163%. Added together, it gives a total of 201% and its climbing rapidly. This may well be a conservative figure, given it is widely acknowledged the central government has overstated GDP growth. Australia, though it frequently features high on lists of the world\u2019s most desirable locations, currently has the world\u2019s second most indebted household sector, at 122% of GDP, soon to overtake Denmark in first place. Combined with private non-financial business sector debt, Australia has a staggering total of 203%, vastly larger than public debts at all levels of government. Australia\u2019s long-term bet on China was and still is conceptually simple \u2013 an incredibly flawed assumption that the country would never cease to consume increasingly more iron ore. The assumption ran right to the top. Back during the Labor (Rudd/Gillard/Rudd) administrations of 2007-13, the bureaucrats at the Reserve Bank and the treasury, alongside the then treasurer Wayne Swan, forecast that China would import so much iron ore up to 2029 that the only way so much steel could be consumed was if they built more houses than there were people. There would also be infrastructure projects like airports, highways, exhibition centres and sports stadiums. This was just the base forecast. The best-case scenario manufactured by Australian bureaucrats would liken parts of China to resemble the planet Coruscant from the Star Wars movies (the political centre of the galaxy, whose surface is covered by an entire city). With incredible complacency, politicians from both sides of parliament basked in the glory and reacted smugly when the US and the eurozone hit a brick wall. So what did Australia do with this rosy outlook? Like a letter of guarantee, the financial services industry used it to convince the international wholesale lending community that the Australian economy was as safe as houses. Lenders around the world were facing an indefinite period of zero interest rates and were desperate for better yield. Australia must have seemed a good place to put their money. For a time, the Australian bet looked good. The banking and financial system collected all the debt they could source from overseas wholesale lenders, underpinning increasingly greater expansion into Australia\u2019s already grossly overvalued residential housing market. Like most other nations in the Asia-Pacific region, the problem for Australia now is that riding on the back of China\u2019s economic growth is no longer a \u201cletter of guarantee\u201d but a statement of significant overexposure to a bad bet and risky mortgage debt. The current downturn in China is smashing the Australian mining industry via lower demand for commodities amid increased global supply, especially in iron ore. As well as hitting Australia hard, the mining export-driven states and territories (Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory) will suffer the most. Population growth rates are falling in these regions, growth is softening and underutilization (unemployment and underemployment) is steadily rising. Spillover effects into the other states are likely, which could impact the country\u2019s largest and most leveraged asset class: the housing market. This may leave little desire for international wholesale lenders to provide credit to the banking and financial system in the future as Australia\u2019s economic prospects deteriorate. It is becoming obvious both domestically and internationally that the country is beset with a massive housing bubble, driven by debt-financed speculation. Without Australia\u2019s lenders importing an ever increasing sum of credit, the overleveraged and overvalued housing market will run into trouble. Government and industry have managed over the last decade and a half to instill severe complacency in Australia, hoping policymakers\u2019 two big bets on the finance, property and mining sectors would continue to pay dividends far into the future. While these bets paid off in the short-term, genuine productivity-enhancing policies which would diminish the incredible and mostly unearned wealth millionaires and billionaires have siphoned off could then be ignored. With the Chinese economy beginning to falter, the fear is Australians must now figure out where their economic future lies for the next generation who have been brainwashed into believing that digging up rocks and flipping houses by accumulating a gargantuan mountain of private debt is how a modern western country builds its future. The results will not be pretty. Lindsay David is the author of Australia: Boom to Bust",

      "body": "<p>Over the last couple of decades, China has undergone profound change and is often cited as an economic growth miracle. Day by day, however, the evidence becomes increasingly clear <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/08/china-stock-markets-buffeted-amid-enduring-currency-concerns\">the probability of a severe economic and financial downturn in China is on the cards</a>. This is not good news at all for Australia. The country is <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/why-everything-you-think-about-the-economy-in-2015-is-probably-wrong-20150106-12iouc.html\">heavily exposed</a>, as China comprises Australia\u2019s top export market, at 33%, more than double the second (Japan at 15%). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/09/2016-world-tumbles-back-economic-crisis\">Is 2016 the year when the world tumbles back into economic crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A considerable proportion of Australia\u2019s current and future economic prospects depend heavily on China\u2019s current strategy of building its way out of poverty while sustaining strong real GDP growth. To date, China has successfully pulled hundreds of millions of its people out of poverty and into the middle class through mass provision of infrastructure and expansion of housing markets, alongside a powerful export operation which the global economy has relied upon since the 1990s for cheap imports.</p> <p>Though <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/04/china-manufacturing-slowdown-ftse-100-stocks-markets\">last week\u2019s volatile falls on the Chinese stock markets </a> alongside a weakening yuan sent shockwaves through the global markets, Australia\u2019s exposure lies much deeper within the Chinese economy. The miracle is starting to look more and more fallible as it slumps under heavy corporate debts and an over-construction spree which shall never again be replicated in our lifetimes or that of our children. </p> <p>As of the second quarter of 2015, China\u2019s household sector debt was a moderate 38% of GDP but its booming <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/statistics/totcredit.htm\">private non-financial business sector debt was 163%.</a> Added together, it gives a total of 201% and its climbing rapidly. This may well be a conservative figure, given it is widely acknowledged the central government has overstated GDP growth.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jan/11/deja-vu-for-australian-economy-as-china-woes-portend-another-bad-year\">Deja vu for Australian economy as China woes portend another bad year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia, though it frequently features high <a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/countries/australia/\">on lists of the world\u2019s most desirable locations</a>, currently has the world\u2019s second most indebted household sector, at 122% of GDP, soon to overtake Denmark in first place. Combined with private non-financial business sector debt, Australia has a staggering total of 203%, vastly larger than public debts at all levels of government.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s long-term bet on China was and still is conceptually simple \u2013 an incredibly flawed assumption that the country would never cease to consume increasingly more iron ore.</p> <p>The assumption ran right to the top. Back during the Labor (Rudd/Gillard/Rudd) administrations of 2007-13, the bureaucrats at the Reserve Bank and the treasury, alongside the then treasurer Wayne Swan,<a href=\"http://blog.australiaboomtobust.com/2015/09/wayne-black-swan/\"> forecast that China would import so much iron ore up to 2029 </a>that the only way so much steel could be consumed was if they built more houses than there were people. There would also be infrastructure projects like airports, highways, exhibition centres and sports stadiums. </p> <p>This was just the base forecast. The best-case scenario manufactured by Australian bureaucrats would liken parts of China to resemble the planet Coruscant from the Star Wars movies (the political centre of the galaxy, whose surface is covered by an entire city). With incredible complacency, politicians from both sides of parliament basked in the glory and reacted smugly when the US and the eurozone hit a brick wall.</p> <p>So what did Australia do with this rosy outlook? Like a letter of guarantee, the financial services industry used it to convince the international wholesale lending community that the Australian economy was as safe as houses. Lenders around the world were facing an indefinite period of zero interest rates and were desperate for better yield. Australia must have seemed a good place to put their money. </p> <p>For a time, the Australian bet looked good. The banking and financial system collected all the debt they could source from overseas wholesale lenders, underpinning increasingly greater expansion into Australia\u2019s already grossly overvalued residential housing market.</p> <p>Like most other nations in the Asia-Pacific region, the problem for Australia now is that riding on the back of China\u2019s economic growth is no longer a \u201cletter of guarantee\u201d but a statement of significant overexposure to a bad bet and risky mortgage debt. The current downturn in China is smashing the Australian mining industry via lower demand for commodities amid increased global supply, especially in iron ore.</p> <p>As well as hitting Australia hard, the mining export-driven states and territories (Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory) will suffer the most. <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3101.0Main%20Features1Jun%202015?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=3101.0&amp;issue=Jun%202015&amp;num=&amp;view=\">Population growth rates are falling in these regions</a>, growth is softening and underutilization (unemployment and underemployment) is steadily rising. Spillover effects into the other states are likely, which could impact the country\u2019s largest and most leveraged asset class: the housing market.</p> <p>This may leave little desire for international wholesale lenders to provide credit to the banking and financial system in the future as Australia\u2019s economic prospects deteriorate. It is becoming obvious both domestically and internationally that the country is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/20/banks-have-treated-our-housing-market-like-a-ponzi-scheme-and-its-about-to-bust\">beset with a massive housing bubble, driven by debt-financed speculation</a>. Without Australia\u2019s lenders importing an ever increasing sum of credit, the overleveraged and overvalued housing market will run into trouble. </p> <p>Government and industry have managed over the last decade and a half to instill severe complacency in Australia, hoping policymakers\u2019 two big bets on the finance, property and mining sectors would continue to pay dividends far into the future. While these bets paid off in the short-term, genuine productivity-enhancing policies which would diminish the incredible and mostly unearned wealth millionaires and billionaires have siphoned off could then be ignored.</p> <p>With the Chinese economy beginning to falter, the fear is Australians must now figure out where their economic future lies for the next generation who have been brainwashed into believing that digging up rocks and flipping houses by accumulating a gargantuan mountain of private debt is how a modern western country builds its future. The results will not be pretty.</p> <p><em>Lindsay David is the author of Australia: Boom to Bust</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, has called for G4S to be stripped of its contract to run children\u2019s prisons after seven members of staff were suspended following abuse claims at a youth offenders institution. Burnham has also called for a wide-ranging review of all the company\u2019s contracts within the criminal justice system to be led by the home secretary and justice secretary. An investigation by BBC\u2019s Panorama, to be aired on Monday evening, features footage taken by an undercover reporter working as a guard at Medway secure training centre (STC), Kent, which holds children aged between 12 and 18. The Panorama reporter witnessed scenes of children being assaulted by guards and using restraint techniques unnecessarily. In one instance, a child tells staff who are squeezing his windpipe that he cannot breathe. \u201cWhat shocks me is that we\u2019ve heard these things time and again, and every time we\u2019ve had bland assurance from G4S it won\u2019t happen again and yet it just carries on the same,\u201d Burnham told the Guardian. In 2004, 15 year-old Gareth Myatt died after being restrained by three adult guards at Rainsbrook STC, operated by G4S, the world\u2019s largest security firm. The teenager, who who was 4ft 10in tall and weighed six-and-a-half stone, was restrained after complaining that he had wrongly been locked in his room as a punishment for failing to clean a sandwich toaster that he said other children had used. G4S currently runs England\u2019s three STCs \u2013 Medway, Oakhill in Milton Keynes and Rainsbrook in Northamptonshire. Following a damning inspection report on Rainsbrook last year, the contract to run Rainsbrook was taken away from G4S in September, although the company is in place until May this year when MTCNovo will take over. The Youth Justice Board also announced in September that G4S had won the contract to operate Medway STC for another five years. G4S said it could win only one of the two STCs under the procurement process. The inspection at Rainsbrook found children had been subjected to degrading treatment and racist comments from staff. Inspectors said some staff took drugs while on duty, colluded with detainees and behaved \u201cextremely inappropriately\u201d with young people, causing distress and humiliation. Six members of staff were dismissed. In 2014, following a Guardian investigation, 14 children who had been unlawfully restrained in STCs run by G4S and Serco were awarded damages amounting to \u00a3100,000. Neither company admitted liability, but paid two thirds of the damages. The remaining third was paid by the YJB. On Friday, G4S announced that seven members of staff at Medway had been suspended following the allegations made by Panorama. Burnham told the Guardian: \u201cThis is first and foremost a matter for Kent police, although it is incumbent on the home secretary to ensure that they have all support and resources they need to cary out. Given that this looks like institutional failure on behalf of G4s, it needs to be a far reaching investigation that doesn\u2019t just concentrate on the individuals concerned but also looks at what was done by those in managerial positions. \u201cBut more broadly it raises very serious questions for the government to answer. If these allegations prove to be true, then an immediate arrangement must be made for G4S to be stripped of this contract ... Given that this company in particular has been drinking in the last-chance saloon when it comes to government contracts, this feels like a failure too far..\u201d Paul Cook, the managing director for G4S children\u2019s services, said: \u201cWe are treating the allegations with the utmost gravity and have taken immediate action to suspend a number of staff members who are alleged to have conducted themselves in a manner which is not in line with our standards. \u201cWe take any allegations of unacceptable or inappropriate behaviour extremely seriously and are giving our full support and cooperation to the local authority designated officer for safeguarding children and the police as the investigation moves forward.\u201d The YJB said no more children would be sent to Medway while the investigation was ongoing.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sweden is one of the most generous countries in the world when it comes to international aid. Along with other Scandinavian countries, it has given bounteously to less fortunate nations for many years. With a population of under 10 million, it also takes more than its fair share of asylum seekers - an estimated 190,000 last year, with a further 100,000 to 170,000 expected to arrive in 2016. This is proving to be an expensive business. The Swedish migration agency says the cost of assimilating such a large number of asylum seekers will be \u20ac6.4bn (\u00a34.4bn) this year \u2013 and a debate is raging about whether the aid budget should be raided to help meet the bill. In 2015, 25% of the aid budget was spent on refugees. One proposal is to raise that figure to 60%. Other countries are responding in similar fashion. Italy raised its aid spending in 2015, but the extra money was mostly spent domestically on those who successfully made the dangerous voyage across the Mediterranean from north Africa. Final figures for development assistance collated by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development show that global aid spending rose to a record level of $137.2bn (\u00a394bn) in 2014 \u2013 an increase of 1.2% on the previous year. But the money is not going to those countries that are in the greatest need. Spending on the least developed countries (LDCs) fell by almost 5% and as a share of the total fell below 30% for the first time since 2005. Donor countries are increasingly dipping into their aid budgets to deal with the migration crisis or diverting money that would previously have gone to sub-Saharan Africa to countries that are deemed to be fragile, such as Egypt, Pakistan and Syria, but are not classified as LDCs. What\u2019s more, the trend is likely to have continued and accelerated in 2015, a year that saw far more people arriving in Europe from north Africa and the Middle East. Italy was already spending 61% of its aid budget on refugees in 2014. For Greece, the other country on the front line, the figure was 46%. It is hardly surprising that the governments in Rome and Athens have responded in this way. Both have had austerity measures foisted upon them and are seeking to make ends meet as best they can. The fact is, though, that the entire development assistance system is creaking under the strain at a time when demands for aid are increasing. In New York City last September, there was a grand gathering at the United Nations where world leaders committed themselves to eradicate poverty within a generation. This year, the wealthier nations are going to be asked to back up their warm words with hard cash. The Global Fund, which fights HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis is aiming to raise at least $12bn. The World Bank is looking for at least four times that much to replenish its International Development Association Fund, which provides cheap or interest-free loans to the poorest countries. The African Development Bank will also be rattling the tin. That\u2019s even before donor countries have to make good on pledges of financial assistance made in Paris last month to help developing nations cope with the effects of climate change. Adrian Lovett, Europe executive director for the ONE campaign, said: \u201cAs more aid is diverted to offer vital help to the increasing numbers of refugees arriving in richer countries, people in desperately poor nations are paying the price. \u201cLast year, world leaders promised to reverse the decline in aid to the least developed countries. Instead, it has got worse \u2013 and increasing numbers of refugees in 2015 mean the problem has almost certainly got even more serious.\u201d That\u2019s true. It is also the case that aid is becoming an increasingly fraught subject. David Cameron has been under fire for increasing Britain\u2019s aid spending to 0.7% of national income rather than spending the money on flood defences at home. Angela Merkel is almost certain to face pressure to spend some of her aid budget on the refugees she has welcomed into Germany. Britain\u2019s international development secretary, Justine Greening, says the UK\u2019s aid budget is money well spent. Her argument is that refugees are arriving in Europe because they lack the opportunity to have a decent life in their own countries. The bills being faced by Sweden, Italy and Greece, she would argue, are the price of dealing with the symptom rather than the cause. This is a sound argument. Quite often, the same people who are loudest in their criticism of overseas aid are also those demanding a zero tolerance approach towards refugees and asylum seekers. The rationale for aid is that it helps build up the economic resilience of poor countries and makes migration less attractive. The aid critics respond by saying that too much of the money is being wasted. They ask why the health systems of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone proved so woefully inadequate during the Ebola crisis and have a ready answer: the money that should have gone on building hospitals and training doctors and hospitals across Africa all too often ended up being spent on expensive western consultants or in the offshore bank accounts of corrupt politicians. Unless supporters of aid are prepared to see public support for overseas development assistance dribble away, this charge needs to be addressed. Continued political support for aid is important because 2016 is going to be a tough year for many LDCs. The collapse in commodity prices and the slowdown in China is starting to bite. Budget deficits are rising and there are already whispers of a new debt crisis. So what needs to be done? First, there has to be tougher action to prevent corruption. The deals done by big western multi-nationals in Africa must be made more transparent, tougher action is needed against tax havens to prevent capital flight. Second, western countries need to recognise that prevention is better than cure. The lesson to be learned from Ebola is that it is better policy to have a plan for long-term economic development rather than to respond to crises when they arise.

      "body": "<p>Sweden is one of the most generous countries in the world when it comes to international aid. Along with other Scandinavian countries, it has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/23/aid-cuts-refugees-extremism-thrive-sweden-norway\">given bounteously to less fortunate nations for many years</a>. With a population of under 10 million, it also takes more than its fair share of asylum seekers - an estimated 190,000 last year, with a further 100,000 to 170,000 expected to arrive in 2016. <br></p> <p>This is proving to be an expensive business. The Swedish migration agency says the cost of assimilating such a large number of asylum seekers will be \u20ac6.4bn (\u00a34.4bn) this year \u2013 and a debate is raging about whether the aid budget should be raided to help meet the bill. In 2015, 25% of the aid budget was spent on refugees. One proposal is to raise that figure to 60%.</p> <p>Other countries are responding in similar fashion. Italy raised its aid spending in 2015, but the extra money was<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/23/mediterranean-migrant-crisis-not-italy-but-europe\"> mostly spent domestically on those who successfully made the dangerous voyage across the Mediterranean from north Africa</a>.<br></p> <p>Final figures for development assistance collated by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development show that global aid spending rose to a record level of $137.2bn (\u00a394bn) in 2014 \u2013 an increase of 1.2% on the previous year. But the money is not going to those countries that are in the greatest need. Spending on the least developed countries (LDCs) fell by almost 5% and as a share of the total fell below 30% for the first time since 2005.</p> <p>Donor countries are increasingly dipping into their aid budgets to deal with the migration crisis or diverting money that would previously have gone to sub-Saharan Africa to countries that are deemed to be fragile, such as Egypt, Pakistan and Syria, but are not classified as LDCs.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, the trend is likely to have continued and accelerated in 2015, a year that saw far more people arriving in Europe from north Africa and the Middle East. Italy was already spending 61% of its aid budget on refugees in 2014. For Greece, the other country on the front line, the figure was 46%.<br></p> <p> It is hardly surprising that the governments in Rome and Athens have responded in this way. Both have had austerity measures foisted upon them and are seeking to make ends meet as best they can. The fact is, though, that the entire development assistance system is creaking under the strain at a time when demands for aid are increasing.<br></p> <p>In New York City last September, there was a grand gathering at the United Nations where world leaders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/live/2015/sep/25/un-sustainable-development-summit-2015-goals-sdgs-united-nations-general-assembly-70th-session-new-york-live\">committed themselves to eradicate poverty within a generation</a>. This year, the wealthier nations are going to be asked to back up their warm words with hard cash. The Global Fund, which fights HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis is aiming to raise at least $12bn. The World Bank is looking for at least four times that much to replenish its International Development Association Fund, which provides cheap or interest-free loans to the poorest countries. The African Development Bank will also be rattling the tin. </p> <p>That\u2019s even before donor countries have to make good on pledges of financial assistance made in Paris last month to help developing nations cope with the effects of climate change.<br></p> <p>Adrian Lovett, Europe executive director for the ONE campaign, said: \u201cAs more aid is diverted to offer vital help to the increasing numbers of refugees arriving in richer countries, people in desperately poor nations are paying the price. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/07/aid-pie-poorest-least-developed-countries-refugees\">The aid pie is growing, but the poorest countries get a smaller slice | Adrian Lovett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cLast year, world leaders promised to reverse the decline in aid to the least developed countries. Instead, it has got worse \u2013 and increasing numbers of refugees in 2015 mean the problem has almost certainly got even more serious.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s true. It is also the case that aid is becoming an increasingly fraught subject. David Cameron has been under fire for increasing Britain\u2019s aid spending to 0.7% of national income rather than spending the money on flood defences at home. Angela Merkel is almost certain to face pressure to spend some of her aid budget on the refugees she has welcomed into Germany.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s international development secretary, Justine Greening, says the UK\u2019s aid budget is money well spent. Her argument is that refugees are arriving in Europe because they lack the opportunity to have a decent life in their own countries. The bills being faced by Sweden, Italy and Greece, she would argue, are the price of dealing with the symptom rather than the cause.</p> <p>This is a sound argument. Quite often, the same people who are loudest in their criticism of overseas aid are also those demanding a zero tolerance approach towards refugees and asylum seekers. The rationale for aid is that it helps build up the economic resilience of poor countries and makes migration less attractive.</p> <p>The aid critics respond by saying that too much of the money is being wasted. They ask why the health systems of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone proved so woefully inadequate during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola crisis</a> and have a ready answer: the money that should have gone on building hospitals and training doctors and hospitals across Africa all too often ended up being spent on expensive western consultants or in the offshore bank accounts of corrupt politicians.</p> <p>Unless supporters of aid are prepared to see public support for overseas development assistance dribble away, this charge needs to be addressed. Continued political support for aid is important because 2016 is going to be a tough year for many LDCs. The collapse in commodity prices and the slowdown in China is starting to bite. Budget deficits are rising and there are already whispers of a new debt crisis.</p> <p>So what needs to be done? First, there has to be tougher action to prevent corruption. The deals done by big western multi-nationals in Africa must be made more transparent, tougher action is needed against tax havens to prevent capital flight.</p> <p>Second, western countries need to recognise that prevention is better than cure. The lesson to be learned from Ebola is that it is better policy to have a plan for long-term economic development rather than to respond to crises when they arise. There should be a robust defence of aid where there is clear evidence that it has helped, as in the fight against HIV/Aids and malaria, but also a recognition of where it has been lacking. Africa requires better infrastructure but the building blocks of development \u2013 energy, water and sanitation, education and transport \u2013 don\u2019t come cheap.</p> <p>If those two conditions are satisfied, and there is no reason why they shouldn\u2019t be, western donors need to stop short-changing the poor. Spending money that should be going to save lives and build futures in Africa on refugee camps in Europe is not just shabby, it is also an admission of failure.<br></p> <p><strong><br></strong></p>",

The departure of Mike Rees, the deputy chief executive and one of the highest paid bankers at Standard Chartered, was announced last week. He is the last remaining high-profile member of the previous management team, which has unravelled since Peter Sands, the chief executive who led the bank through the financial crisis, resigned last February. Rees could also receive a bonus payout worth \u00a32.7m at current share prices, and will be paid $2.5m (\u00a31.7m) in salary and allowances for the rest of the year. The payouts following calculations by Bloomberg that Rees had been paid $72m in the six years since the financial crisis. Rees had his management responsibilities reduced by Bill Winters, the new chief executive of the bank, in a management overhaul in July. Rees kept the title of deputy chief executive but no longer had the bank\u2019s three main divisions reporting to him. He is the last of the senior team who helped oversee a rapid increase in profits at the bank until 2013, when Standard Chartered had to admit the period of growth that helped it to stand out during the financial crisis was coming to an end. Rees \u2013 who turns 60 next month when his pension accruals will come to an end \u2013 will step down as deputy chief executive at the end of April. However, he will remain until the end of year to help the management with \u201ca comprehensive programme of actions relating to the group\u2019s new strategy\u201d. He has been at Standard Chartered for 26 years. The bank also pledged that the chairman Sir John Peace would go in 2016 once Winters, who used to work JP Morgan, had settled into the role. The bank has decided that Rees can be regarded as a good leaver, allowing him to keep any unexercised share awards that can pay out over the coming years. He has 202,000 shares which are not subject to any performance criteria and 344,000 whose payout is dependent on performance. If they were all to be paid out in full at current share prices they would be worth more \u00a32.7m. The shares fell almost 40% last year. At the end of the year, Winters raised \u00a33.3bn from Standard Charter investors and said 15,000 jobs needed to be axed as it attempts to revitalise its performance and pull out of risker trading activities. When he announced the cash call in November, Winters told City analysts there were some good aspects to Standard Chartered but they were buried under \u201cfertiliser\u201d.",

Roughly 6.4% of the company\u2019s shares are being shorted by hedge funds \u2013 a position worth more than \u00a3300m. This means that Burberry is the fifth most shorted company in the FTSE 100 according to figures from Markit. Burberry will reveal its sales figures for the last three months on Thursday, with analysts at the company\u2019s house broker Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) warning they are likely to be disappointing.

      "bodyText": "The idea of going bra shopping used to be a long way down Heidi Zak\u2019s list of priorities. \u201cThe way that a woman normally gets fitted for a bra is that there is an older lady who is going to measure you with a measuring tape,\u201d she explained. \u201cA lot of women don\u2019t feel comfortable with that process [and] don\u2019t get measured so they don\u2019t know their true size.\u201d However, Zak may have found a modern alternative to the ritual of getting sized up in the dressing room of a department store \u2013 using iPhones to calculate the dimensions of a woman\u2019s bust at home. Technology developed by Thirdlove, the San Francisco-based bra company which Zak co-founded, can work out the appropriate bra size for a woman through photos she has taken in front of a mirror. \u201cWe are providing the fitting mechanism from the comfort of a woman\u2019s home without her needing to interact with anyone else,\u201d Zak said. The technology not only means women can avoid the awkward trip to the department store, but it stops them wearing bras that are uncomfortable and not the right fit. As many as six out of every 10 women suffer from this problem according to surveys. The sizing technology works via an iPhone app. To use it, a woman must take two pictures of themselves while wearing a tight fitted top in front of a mirror. The phone is held at the bellybutton and a picture is taken from the front and the side. Software developed by Thirdlove then draws up measurements by calculating the distance between the mirror and the contours of the body. \u201cI can detect the size of her body in relation to the phone and then we infer a circumference and a body shape from that. In essence what we are getting is her overbust, her underbust measurement and her body shape, which is the same thing a bra fitter gets in a store,\u201d said Zak. \u201cThrough our technology we understand what sort of phone [iPhone 4, 5, or 6] you are on. From there we understand how far you are from the mirror based on the size of the phone and then we can calculate a woman\u2019s body in relation to the phone itself. In essence, when you think of a women in the store getting out the measuring tape, we are doing that using a phone as a standard unit of measure.\u201d When the pictures have been processed, the women is shown the measurements of the bust and a recommended bra size for Thirdlove\u2019s range of products, which includes half sizes. The use of the smartphone in calculating sizes represents another step in bridging the gap between traditional clothes shopping and e-commerce. In Sweden, a company called Volumental has developed software that can estimate the exact size of a foot using cameras. Customers can then use these details to make bespoke shoes. So far the growth of online clothing sales has failed to match initial expectations. About 15 years ago it was expected that online sales would account for between 40% and 50% of clothing sales by now, but the actual figure is less than half these projections according to Zak. One of the main reasons for this is that shoppers cannot establish the fit of clothing through a website. As a result, return rates for online clothing can average between 30% and 40% for retailers. \u201cBras are the most extreme category because fit is everything,\u201d Zak added. \u201cExchange rates are really, really high.\u201d However with tools such as Thirdlove\u2019s, Zak says people will become increasingly comfortable buying clothes online. Thirdlove\u2019s return rates are now less than 5%, with one-in-three bra sales coming through the new sizing technology. Nonetheless, some women are still sceptical that finding the correct bra fitting can be solved by an app. \u201cI have had many, many women say to me \u2018I totally can\u2019t believe this will actually work\u2019,\u201d says Zak. \u201cThey try it because they are being \u2018this is crazy, of course this is not going to work\u2019. Then they get a size and it is a half size and it seems really right.\u201d Problems can emerge when the phone is not held in the right way, meaning the gyroscopes in the device cannot record the proper measurement. \u201cIt is more accurate than a measuring tape assuming someone follows the directions properly. There can be user error, a lot of it has to do with holding the phone at the right angle,\u201d she said. Prices for the bras range between \u00a333 ($49) and \u00a346 with a shipping fee of \u00a317 applying to orders from the UK. Each bra lasts an average of about a year. The clothing is functional, according to Zak, and it should mean that women no longer have to take off their uncomfortable bra as soon as they get home at the end of the day. The initial scepticism about having a bra fitted via a mobile phone seems to be reducing: the technology is being used by roughly as many women over the age of 45 as those under that age. Thirdlove has so far received \u00a33.83m ($5.6m) in investment.

      "bodyText": "On Sunday night, as Detroit fills with auto journalists and car executives, Volkswagen will hold a media party at Fishbone\u2019s, the Cajun-themed restaurant in the city\u2019s Greektown neighbourhood. It\u2019ll be the opening salvo in a PR offensive the German company will be hoping can finally turn the tide after arguably the worst year in its history. Three months after the revelation that Volkswagen Group was using an illegal software fix called a \u201cdefeat device\u201d to circumvent US environmental regulations on about 600,000 of its diesel-powered passenger cars, the company will showcase its new vehicles at the US\u2019s largest car show on Monday. The unveiling, however, is sure to be overshadowed by news that the Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that could result in about $48bn in fines and penalties. The defeat device has been seen by federal and international regulators and many consumers as an egregious flouting of environmental protection laws. The justice department said in a statement last Monday that the vehicles \u2013 certain Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche models equipped with 2- and 3-litre diesel engines \u2013 had emitted as much as 40 times the accepted level of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) into the atmosphere. \u201cWith today\u2019s filing, we take an important step to protect public health by seeking to hold Volkswagen accountable for any unlawful air pollution,\u201d Cynthia Giles, a administrator with the EPA\u2019s office of enforcement and compliance assurance, said in the statement. Dieselgate, as it\u2019s become known, has affected about 11m vehicles worldwide. The scandal prompted yet another apology from Volkswagen, this time from Dr Herbert Diess, Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive of passenger vehicles, who addressed a crowd at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. Although the department has also been investigating VW executives over criminal fraud allegations, no charges have been filed. Martin Winterkorn, who had been chief executive of Volkswagen Group since 2007, resigned several days after news of the scandal broke but denied any personal involvement in the cheat. New CEO Matthias M\u00fceller will be in Washington on Wednesday, when the press days at Detroit have wrapped up, for a grilling by the EPA. Moving beyond the scandal is imperative for VW. Sales have dropped 4% this year, with a 9% decrease in December alone, according to figures provided by Kelley Blue Book. \u201cThe diesel scandal has affected VW about how we expected,\u201d Akshay Anand, an analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said. \u201cSales are down, but they haven\u2019t killed the company. Transaction prices are down a bit, too, but they\u2019re not overwhelming.\u201d Anand said VW was planning a big product release at the end of 2016 and suggested that the company should be more proactive about resolving potential recalls on existing vehicles. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have it figured out by then, it may affect sales,\u201d Anand said. \u201cThat\u2019s still a ways off though, so there\u2019s time for VW to right the ship.\u201d Giles, from the EPA, expressed dissatisfaction with the federal government\u2019s talks with VW thus far. \u201cSo far, recall discussions with the company have not produced an acceptable way forward,\u201d she said. \u201cThese discussions will continue in parallel with the federal court action.\u201d Anand said consumers had been \u2013 for the most part \u2013 forgiving of Volkswagen\u2019s actions. But Ashley Scarpa, who owns a 2014 Volkswagen Passat TDI, felt differently. She said VW mailed her a $500 Visa card, three years of roadside assistance and a $500 VW gift certificate that she doesn\u2019t know what to do with. \u201cMy car is less than a year old, with maintenance included for the first three years, so I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do with the VW card that expires in a year,\u201d she said, adding that she already had roadside assistance through her insurance. \u201cMaybe I can buy tires and store them in my garage?\u201d But as a sea turtle conservation volunteer and someone who generally cares about the environment, she says she still feels betrayed. The right thing to do, she reasoned, would be for VW to buy back the car or issue a partial refund. The emissions scandal has undone decades of wooing US customers with promises of a greener future, and VW has a lot to prove this week. \u201cWhat I really want is what I thought I was buying,\u201d Scarpa said. \u201cI want my car to be environmentally superior, but at this point \u2013 at the very least \u2013 I want it to be compliant with emissions standards.\u201d",

The right thing to do, she reasoned, would be for VW to buy back the car or issue a partial refund.<br></p> <p>The emissions scandal has undone decades of wooing US customers with promises of a greener future, and VW has a lot to prove this week.<br></p> <p>\u201cWhat I really want is what I thought I was buying,\u201d Scarpa said. \u201cI want my car to be environmentally superior, but at this point \u2013 at the very least \u2013 I want it to be compliant with emissions standards.\u201d</p>",

The trio have been battling for customers with each other, Walmart-owned Asda and German value chains Aldi and Lidl. Morrisons, which reports on Tuesday, may have the best chance to spring a nice surprise because expectations are so low. Sainsbury\u2019s has been the best performer of the big grocers, but boss Mike Coupe is considering taking a punt on a bid for Argos\u2019s owner, Home Retail Group. Sainsbury\u2019s revealed its interest last week and this will add spice to its update on Wednesday. At Tesco, the sector\u2019s lumbering giant, investors will look on Thursday to see if signs of revival under newish broom Dave Lewis lasted through Christmas. Asda, which suffered badly at the hands of the discounters last year, puts its figures out in February but the Kantar and Nielsen market share surveys will give a good idea of its performance, as well as how Aldi and Lidl fared. Away from the grocers, there will be updates from JD Sports, Greggs, Debenhams, Mothercare, Home Retail, Dunelm, Game Digital, Boohoo.com, AO.com and others. As veteran analyst Nick Bubb rounded off his preview note: \u201cPhew!\u201d Sharper relief at last? In October, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, reaffirmed his view that the decision to increase interest rates \u201ccomes into sharper relief around the turn of the year\u201d. Well, here we are: but hardly anyone expects the Bank\u2019s rate-setters to increase borrowing costs on Thursday. Market forecasts expect the vote to remain at 8-1 with Ian McCafferty, the former CBI economist, still the lone hawk. Markets increasingly think the first rate rise will be in the second half of this year or even in 2017. Outside events have made a rate rise less likely, with share prices tumbling and concern about global growth caused by bad news from the Chinese economy and stock market. But domestic economic news has also got worse since Carney teed markets up for a rise: wage growth has slowed, and surveys have shown manufacturing exports stagnating and Britain\u2019s dominant services sector weakening. Neil Woodford, perhaps the UK\u2019s most closely followed investor, has said that a rate rise this year would be \u201cludicrous\u201d because the economy could not stand it. With the economy once again propped up by consumer spending, and buy-to-let purchases booming, things could be all the more painful when rates eventually do rise. New year, new trials On Monday, a group of the City\u2019s former top traders will appear in court accused of manipulating the euro interbank offered rate. The 10 traders from Deutsche Bank and Barclays will be the largest group of defendants to face trial accused of fixing rates: a trial of six former employees of City interbank brokers is currently drawing to a conclusion in London. The big names involved in the new trial include Christian Bittar, formerly of Deutsche Bank, and Philippe Moryoussef, who worked at Barclays. Both men vigorously deny the charges. Bittar was one of Deutsche Bank\u2019s most profitable traders before he was fired in 2011. The trial will be the first time Barclays traders have faced charges over interest rate manipulation. Bob Diamond left as the bank\u2019s chief executive in the wake of the matter in 2012 and it cost Barclays \u00a3290m in fines. Moryoussef worked at Barclays between 2005 and 2007 before joining other banks including RBS and Nomura. Tom Hayes, a former UBS and Citi trader also involved in the scandal, is serving 11 years after being found guilty in August. His letters describing prison life, including being strip-searched and witnessing fights and overdoses, will have made grim reading for those facing similar allegations.",

      "bodyText": "Genius or madness? That\u2019s what one City analyst wondered when news of Sainsbury\u2019s bid approach to Home Retail Group, owner of Argos and Homebase, broke last week. Madness \u2013 or, at the very least, an unnecessary distraction \u2013 concluded most observers. Isn\u2019t Argos in mortal danger from the relentless march of Amazon? Isn\u2019t Sainsbury\u2019s itself trying to keep its ahead above water in a grocery market suffering deflation, discounting and maybe disruption from the same Amazonian monster? As for Homebase, Sainsbury\u2019s doesn\u2019t seem to want to own it anyway. It might flip the DIY chain to a new owner as quickly as it can, introducing another uncertainty into the arithmetic of the deal. In other words, Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, faces a tough task convincing his own shareholders of the wisdom of paying \u00a31bn-plus to build what the supermarket chain called \u201can integrated multi-channel proposition\u201d spanning food and non-food lines. It was only the target\u2019s shareholders (if not their board \u2013 yet) who seemed outright enthusiastic \u2013 but any takeover bid at a half-decent premium will feel like sweet relief after last year\u2019s halving of Home Retail\u2019s share price. But is the logic of a Sainsbury\u2019s/Argos combo really so daft, though? Actually, probably not. There are two arguments \u2013 one short-term, one long-term \u2013 for why Coupe may be on to something and why the inevitable upheaval for his staff may prove to be worth the risk. The short-term appeal is that 40% of Argos leases expire in the next four years. That presents an early opportunity to close those shops and open a replacement Argos unit within the nearest Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket, many of which have surplus space. There could be about 350 such units within a few years. If all Argos punters stay loyal, there are two benefits: you make a big saving on rent but keep all the custom; and some of the Argos punters may pick up a few groceries while they collect their toasters, toys and gadgets. Ten experimental Argos concessions within Sainsbury\u2019s stores are said to have traded well in the past year. The long-term benefit is woollier \u2013 but perhaps more significant if Sainsbury\u2019s analysis is correct. It is the idea that, in the \u201cmulti-channel\u201d age, speed and ease of delivery are retailers\u2019 best weapons. Facing up to the Amazon threat, Argos has developed a same-day delivery service, albeit not without hiccups. If those deliveries could be diverted to a Sainsbury\u2019s store, if the customer wishes, another 1,300 pick-up points would join the network. The philosophy clearly works for the John Lewis Partnership, the department store and Waitrose group. Do such advantages amount to genius? Not without hard numbers to support them. Sainsbury\u2019s shareholders should demand several details before they support any takeover terms Coupe and chairman David Tyler can agree with the Home Retail board. What is the real size of the rental saving from closing Argos stores? How quickly could it be secured? How many Argos stores would have to be closed in addition? What is the uplift in sales at those 10 Sainsbury\u2019s stores with Argos units? How much would Homebase fetch, realistically? Can Sainsbury\u2019s balance sheet stand the strain of a takeover funded partly in cash? And, most importantly, how much extra investment would be required to integrate IT systems and back-office logistics? If Coupe can provide credible answers on all those points, investors should support the adventure. The merger between Dixons and Carphone Warehouse, which has enjoyed a successful first year, is one concrete example of mutually beneficial piece of deal-making. A Sainsbury\u2019s/Argos combination sounds more unlikely on paper \u2013 the customer stereotypes are miles apart \u2013 but it might just work. Indeed, if it had been proposed a decade ago, it would have laughed out of court but, as it turns out, it would been exactly in tune with shifting shopping habits in the 21st century. Wind of change in Saudi Arabia? The Saudi government has lobbed a hand grenade into the debate on the future of oil prices by proposing the stock market flotation of its corporate crown jewel, Saudi Aramco. The possibility that a multitrillion-dollar oil and gas giant could be prepared for an initial public offering will have western investment bankers booking air tickets to Riyadh 10 to the dozen as they vie for a potential bonanza of advice work. Western oil majors and Asian state-owned energy groups likewise will wet their lips at possibly gaining access to some of the world\u2019s cheapest and largest oil and gas reserves. Shell would surely have kept the $7bn it wasted on high-cost and high-risk Arctic exploration had it known there might be a possibility of spending it on a chunk of Aramco, which has 650bn barrels of reserves (10 times those of ExxonMobil). Meanwhile, oil traders wonder what it means for future oil prices given that the Saudis have been instrumental in driving down global crude values by refusing to countenance a cut in Opec production targets. Will that strategy change? Certainly you would not choose to sell a commodity-based business at a time when prices have fallen 70% in 18 months and with stock market valuations for the sector on the floor. At least part of the rationale of an IPO is to raise cash for the Saudi exchequer at a time when the country has seen a rising national budget deficit due to the collapse in its vital oil revenues. Or is it designed to show that the state is prepared to make its sacrifices as it has recently cut subsidies in domestic fuel prices? Or are the Saudis preparing to battle it out with US shale producers long-term by keeping Aramco production high? As with all things Saudi, there is scant information, just a clear statement of intent and backing from the king\u2019s powerful son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, that an IPO is being seriously considered for a company previously thought one of the least likely to be put into private hands. But if an IPO is to attract western investors, the Saudis will have to share decision-making and break an addiction to secrecy. Can they do that? Pennycook\u2019s many parts Richard Pennycook was paid \u00a32.5m last year for his role as chief executive of the Co-operative Group, now largely a supermarkets group. Yet, when he resigned from his role as a non-executive director of housebuilder Persimmon last week, citing time commitments, there was no mention of his full-time job at the Co-op. Instead, it was his appointment as chairman of Howdens Joinery from May 2016 that was regarded as the additional pressure on his time. He was already sitting on the board of Howdens, so in giving up Persimmon he turned two non-executive roles into one big non-exec role alongside his chairmanship of the online department store The Hut. With master of serial directorships, Allan Leighton, chairing the Co-op, such plurality will no doubt be deftly managed.",

Instead, it was his appointment as chairman of Howdens Joinery from May 2016 that was regarded as the additional pressure on his time.</p> <p>He was already sitting on the board of Howdens, so in giving up Persimmon he turned two non-executive roles into one big non-exec role alongside his chairmanship of the online department store The Hut.</p> <p>With master of serial directorships, Allan Leighton, chairing the Co-op, such plurality will no doubt be deftly managed.</p>",

I do not know how many the chancellor might have sampled, but his demeanour appears to have been transformed from one of blatant complacency in his autumn statement to pre-budget nerves. He now warns of \u201ca dangerous cocktail of new threats\u201d and, yes, \u201ccreeping complacency\u201d in the British economic and political debate. This is not, of course, anything to do with him and the complacency he was fostering as recently as before Christmas. No, this is mainly because of threats to the global economic recovery emanating from a manifest slowdown in China and the impact the collapse of oil prices is having on the economies and finances of oil-producing nations \u2013 with the obvious exception of the oil-producing country known as the United States, whose \u201cfracking\u201d boom has made no small contribution to oversupply and falling prices in energy markets. It must be emphasised, however, that the oil price collapse, while affecting potential new investment in the North Sea, has had a largely beneficent impact on real incomes and consumer demand in nations such as Britain and other members of the EU. (Yes, we are still in it \u2013 just.) Indeed, it has offset to an appreciable extent the twin squeezes on economic demand of low wage rises and the austerity programmes favoured by Osborne and much of the eurozone. Faced apparently with downward revisions to economic forecasts made as recently as November and December, what does the chancellor do? Does he consider for one moment that perhaps he should rescind the austerity programme that aims at a budget surplus on current and capital account within a few years? No, on the contrary: he warns of \u201cthe beginning of the decline\u201d of Britain unless the cuts to vital services continue. Moreover he unashamedly boasts to John Humphrys on the Today programme of conducting \u201cthe most sustained squeeze on public spending for 100 years\u201d. The chutzpah of this chancellor knows few bounds. He managed to tell a straight lie to his interviewer when the subject came up of the prime minister\u2019s about-turn on his instructions to cabinet ministers regarding campaigning in the forthcoming EU referendum. And the cuts continue despite the flood (pun intended) of evidence that they are shortsighted and counterproductive, after the pattern of false economies generally. Way back in 2004 my old friend Sir David King, then chief scientific adviser to the Blair government, warned that, as a consequence of global warming, \u201cwe must either invest more in sustainable approaches to flood and coastal management or learn to live with increased flooding.\u201d In come David Cameron and George Osborne in 2010 to cut back on the budget for flood management, with the result that the floodgates open on the so-called \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d. The thing about this government is that in so many key areas it is such a sham. The real problem facing the British economy continues to be its overseas trade deficit, not the budget deficit. Why, even the Financial Times, which, with the honourable exception of certain columnists, has been far too supportive of the cuts agenda, recently published a fascinating item about the obsession with the budget deficit. In a survey of more than 100 \u201ceconomic thinkers\u201d, the FT found that nearly half the respondents were concerned about the chancellor\u2019s dependence on household consumption to fuel the recovery, with the resulting trade and current account deficit, but \u201cone concern was notable by its absence\u201d. The FT went on: \u201cJust three respondents cited the fiscal deficit as a big worry.\u201d Repeat: just three, even though it has been the overriding obsession of the chancellor, a largely supportive press and, I regret to say, many BBC interviewers. To its credit, the opposition has tried to hit back. Unfortunately to all intents and purposes it might as well have been firing blanks, because almost all the media coverage of the Labour party has been focused on the divisions within its ranks.

Oh dear: the poor old Labour party. Desperately needed, but opening all its flanks to its enemies. It is sad, indeed tragic, that the opposition has become a laughing stock when the real laughing stock should be a government whose chancellor tells us after five-and-a-half years of unnecessary and counterproductive austerity: \u201cAnyone who thinks it\u2019s mission accomplished with the British economy is making a great mistake.\u201d Yes, the mission is more of the same, with the severe risk of exit from the European Union thrown in.",

      "bodyText": "The US economy ended 2015 with improvement in the labour market. Jobs grew by 284,000 each month on average in the last quarter and if you squint pretty hard at the data you can see a mild acceleration in the pace of nominal wage growth. There will be plenty who will claim this justifies the Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions to raise short-term interest rates for the first time since 2007, and who will argue further that the economic concerns raised by the great recession and its aftermath can now be reshelved. They would then conclude that the focus can return to policy perennials like the need to reduce deficits and ensure that wage and price inflation do not spiral out of control. However, this view that the economy \u2013 in the US as elsewhere \u2013 has achieved escape velocity is not just premature, but dangerous. In a recent article, Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate in economics, picked up an earlier warning of his fear that the world was falling into a \u201cgreat malaise\u201d. Stiglitz described an \u201ceconomics of inertia\u201d and reasserted his view that the obstacles facing the global economy \u201cwere not rooted in economics, but in politics and ideology\u201d. Even in the years before the great recession, the data indicated that it\u2019s become harder and harder to sustain the growth necessary to keep the economy at full employment. You\u2019ve probably heard of this debate \u2013 former US treasury secretary Larry Summers has borrowed the term \u201csecular stagnation\u201d (from economist Alvin Hansen) to describe this chronic demand shortfall. As much as I approve of learning from Hansen (the \u201cAmerican Keynes\u201d), the \u201csecular stagnation\u201d term has mostly just been confusing to many following this debate. In simple terms, what has caused the chronic demand shortfall? There are plenty of answers, but prominent among them is the rising inequality that strangles demand growth. Basically, in the last generation we have shovelled lots of money up to the households at the top of the income distribution, which tend to save a much larger share of it than other households. These savings need to be channelled into investments in productive capacity in order not to create demand shortages. But this translation of savings into job-creating investments has required lower and lower interest rates over time. But when short-term rates slam into zero, that seamless transition of savings to job-creating investments grinds to a halt. For decades, the economy \u2013 at least according to the ruling presumptions \u2013 naturally tended to move quickly not just towards full employment but tried to overshoot full employment and spark economic overheating. It was thus the policymakers\u2019 primary job to keep this in check. So, for example, in the US the Fed had to be ever vigilant about keeping inflation tame \u2013 both wage and price inflation. If the economy was always tending towards ever lower unemployment rates, this would embolden workers into making wage demands that employers had no choice but to accommodate, but which the underlying productivity of economy just couldn\u2019t deliver. So firms raised prices to accommodate higher labour costs, which just spurred empowered workers to demand higher nominal wages to make up for the higher prices they faced\u2026and we were off to wage/price spirals. And in this world where aggregate demand never ran behind supply, any trade deficit that emerged could only occur due to the failure of American households, businesses and governments to save enough. These were the ruling presumptions that macroeconomic policymakers followed, presumptions that led to the savage early 1980s recession engineered by interest-rate increases being applauded as brave and necessary. These presumptions also led to an entire generation of fiscal policy analysts across the political spectrum being preoccupied with reducing budget deficits as a way to insure interest rates would not soar and crowd-out productive private investment. Episodes where demand growth unambiguously fell behind supply growth \u2013 normal people call these \u201crecessions\u201d \u2013 happened, for sure. But these recessions were thought to be naturally short and shallow \u2013 or at least short and shallow so long as interest rates came down for a spell. None of this describes the world we\u2019re in right now. Wage and price inflation is worryingly low, not high. Far from acting as a vigilante that punishes government profligacy, today\u2019s bond markets are positively begging for more government debt to absorb. And exchange rates are pushed around by influences far removed from Americans\u2019 savings decisions, and the trade imbalances that result from exchange rate movements matter a lot for nations\u2019 economic health. It\u2019s worth a quick detour here to ask whether or not the ruling policy presumptions of macroeconomics that I\u2019ve described above were ever right. Between 1979 and 1995, for example, the Federal Reserve kept the unemployment rate well above even its own (probably too conservative) estimate of the \u201cnatural rate\u201d. As a result, wage and price inflation rates fell significantly and continuously between those years. A key casualty was the pay of the vast majority of American workers, which either stagnated or fell for the bottom 70%. The late 1990s saw a rapid \u201ctightening\u201d of labour markets (that is, in crude terms, plenty of people were in work; and the economy was \u201cgood\u201d). This episode really should loom much larger in US policymaking than it seems to today. In the mid-1990s, for example, a range of economists across the political spectrum confidently proclaimed that the unemployment rate could not go below 5.5% without setting off an acceleration of wage and price inflation. Then unemployment started falling below that and stayed there for a significant time. However, the result was not an acceleration of wage and price growth. Instead workers saw the first across-the-board increase in inflation-adjusted hourly wages in a generation. These results should make today\u2019s policymakers much greedier for the benefits of aggressively plumbing the depths of how low unemployment can go without sparking unsustainable inflation. If the mid-1990s consensus had been followed instead of discarded (and credit for this one goes to Alan Greenspan, then chair of the Fed), millions of Americans would have had no work opportunities in the late 1990s, and tens of millions would have missed out on the first pay rises they would see in their lifetime. The sources of the tight labour markets in the late 1990s are similarly instructive, in a less happy way. They were built on a bubble \u2013 the IT and stock market bubble. When it burst in 2001, an inevitable recession followed. And while the 2001 recession was short and shallow, the recovery and expansion that followed was positively anaemic \u2013 the worst in post-second world war history. And the main source of this weakness was clear \u2013 a deficiency of aggregate demand that was so extreme that by 2003 Ben Bernanke (when he was a Fed governor but before he was the Fed chair) gave speeches trying to reassure people that the Fed could indeed push back against outright deflation if the need arose. In short, by the early 2000s it should have been crystal clear that demand-generation was a huge problem. The post-2001 recovery and expansion finally gained some steam \u2013 but only when aided by a $7 trillion bubble in housing wealth. Even with this boost, the unemployment rate and other measures of labour market health never got very close to the 1990s peaks. Inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom 70% fell in the last years of the expansion. In the end, the housing bubble burst, causing a financial crisis and (more important for most Americans and others) leaving a large hole in aggregate demand as households could no longer support consumption by borrowing against the value of their homes. This hole was never adequately filled in, leaving the recovery slow and still-incomplete a full seven years after the recession began. This leaves a key question: what does it all mean for policymaking? The chronic demand shortfall has lots of implications. Most immediately, the Fed needs to stop thinking that the US economy is constantly on the knife-edge of setting off wage and price inflation spirals if interest rates are kept too low for too long. The biggest wage problem in the US economy in recent decades is not they\u2019re always surging ahead, it\u2019s that it\u2019s quite hard to make them rise. Interest-rate tightening can wait until actual inflation is seen in the data. Policymakers need to resist putting deficit reduction above all other goals. Budget deficits do no damage when run during times of slack demand. When the economy is at the zero lower bound \u2013 when the interest rate is at or near zero \u2013 they boost demand in a system positively starved for it. Further, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a shortage of reasonable public investment projects to undertake. For example, we still don\u2019t price carbon in this economy, so private investments in energy efficiency and emissions mitigation are radically under-provided. Further afield, as Stiglitz noted, \u201cthe entire world needs to retrofit itself to face the reality of global warming\u201d. Given this, why not ramp up public investments in this area? The marginal return on the first billions we spend on such investments is near infinite in the insurance value it provides in protecting against climate disasters. Finally, we circle back to the rise in inequality that is a root cause of the chronic demand shortfall. The main reason (and a sufficient one) to try to check or even reverse the rise of inequality is simply that it\u2019s the most reliable way to boost the living standards of low- and moderate-income households. But it also turns out that if we reverse this rise in inequality, we may well go a long way to reversing the problem of chronic demand shortfalls. This is an ambitious, long-run project. The rise in inequality is at its root a decline in the bargaining power of low and moderate-wage workers. Reversing it will not happen through one-off increases in the minimum wage or the generosity of the wage subsidies. (Though I\u2019m in favour of both! And this year already in the US, five states and nine cities are considering raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.) A real reversal will occur only if there is a sustained, durable shift of economic power to low- and moderate wage workers. This in turn will happen only with policy levers across a wide range being pulled: expansionary macroeconomic policy to keep jobs markets tight, labour policy to set wage-floors and other protections for workers and to police violations. Then there\u2019s tax policy to make it less profitable for chief executives and highly paid managers to rig the rules of the game to tilt more money their way, regulatory policy to insure that the financial sector does not become a drain on economy-wide productivity in other areas. Also, we should look at international policy to ensure aggregate demand is not exported away to countries that manage the value of their own currencies for competitive gain. Finally, a restoration of workers\u2019 rights to form unions and to bargain collectively. Ambitious, yes, but worth doing, not just for the sake of fairness, but for the sake of economic growth and stability.

Stiglitz described an \u201ceconomics of inertia\u201d and reasserted his view that the obstacles facing the global economy \u201cwere not rooted in economics, but in politics and ideology\u201d.</p> <p>Even in the years before the great recession, the data indicated that it\u2019s become harder and harder to sustain the growth necessary to keep the economy at full employment. You\u2019ve probably heard of this debate \u2013 former US treasury secretary Larry Summers has borrowed the term \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/jan/25/davos-inequality-root-cause-stagnation\" title=\"\">secular stagnation</a>\u201d (from economist Alvin Hansen) to describe this chronic demand shortfall. As much as I approve of learning from Hansen (the \u201cAmerican Keynes\u201d), the \u201csecular stagnation\u201d term has mostly just been confusing to many following this debate.</p> <p>In simple terms, what has caused the chronic demand shortfall? There are plenty of answers, but prominent among them is the rising inequality that strangles demand growth. Basically, in the last generation we have shovelled lots of money up to the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/files/charts/img/1504.png\" title=\"\">households at the top</a> of the income distribution, which tend to save a much larger share of it than other households. These savings need to be channelled into investments in productive capacity in order not to create demand shortages. But this translation of savings into job-creating investments has required lower and lower interest rates over time. But when short-term rates slam into zero, that seamless transition of savings to job-creating investments grinds to a halt.</p> <p>For decades, the economy \u2013 at least according to the ruling presumptions \u2013 naturally tended to move quickly not just towards full employment but tried to overshoot full employment and spark economic overheating. It was thus the policymakers\u2019 primary job to keep this in check.</p> <p>So, for example, in the US the Fed had to be ever vigilant about keeping inflation tame \u2013 both wage and price inflation. If the economy was always tending towards ever lower unemployment rates, this would embolden workers into making wage demands that employers had no choice but to accommodate, but which the underlying productivity of economy just couldn\u2019t deliver.</p> <p>So firms raised prices to accommodate higher labour costs, which just spurred empowered workers to demand higher nominal wages to make up for the higher prices they faced\u2026and we were off to wage/price spirals. And in this world where aggregate demand never ran behind supply, any trade deficit that emerged could only occur due to the failure of American households, businesses and governments to save enough.</p> <p>These were the ruling presumptions that macroeconomic policymakers followed, presumptions that led to the savage early 1980s recession engineered by interest-rate increases being applauded as brave and necessary. These presumptions also led to an entire generation of fiscal policy analysts across the political spectrum being preoccupied with reducing budget deficits as a way to insure interest rates would not soar and crowd-out productive private investment.</p> <p>Episodes where demand growth unambiguously fell behind supply growth \u2013 normal people call these \u201crecessions\u201d \u2013 happened, for sure. But these recessions were thought to be naturally short and shallow \u2013 or at least short and shallow so long as interest rates came down for a spell.</p> <p>None of this describes the world we\u2019re in right now. Wage and price inflation is worryingly <em>low</em>, not high. Far from acting as a vigilante that punishes government profligacy, today\u2019s bond markets are positively begging for more government debt to absorb. And exchange rates are pushed around by influences far removed from Americans\u2019 savings decisions, and the trade imbalances that result from exchange rate movements matter a lot for nations\u2019 economic health.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth a quick detour here to ask whether or not the ruling policy presumptions of macroeconomics that I\u2019ve described above were <em>ever</em> right. Between 1979 and 1995, for example, the Federal Reserve kept the unemployment rate well above even its own (probably too conservative) estimate of the \u201cnatural rate\u201d. As a result, wage and price inflation rates fell significantly and continuously between those years. A key casualty was the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/files/charts/img/9265.png\" title=\"\">pay</a> of the vast majority of American workers, which either stagnated or fell for the bottom 70%.</p> <p>The late 1990s saw a rapid \u201ctightening\u201d of labour markets (that is, in crude terms, plenty of people were in work; and the economy was \u201cgood\u201d). This episode really should loom much larger in US policymaking than it seems to today. In the mid-1990s, for example, a range of economists across the political spectrum confidently proclaimed that the unemployment rate could not go below 5.5% without setting off an acceleration of wage and price inflation. Then unemployment started falling below that and stayed there for a significant time. However, the result was not an acceleration of wage and price growth. Instead workers saw the first across-the-board increase in inflation-adjusted hourly wages in a generation.</p> <p>These results should make today\u2019s policymakers much greedier for the benefits of aggressively plumbing the depths of how low unemployment can go without sparking unsustainable inflation. If the mid-1990s consensus had been followed instead of discarded (and credit for this one goes to Alan Greenspan, then chair of the Fed), millions of Americans would have had no work opportunities in the late 1990s, and tens of millions would have missed out on the first pay rises they would see in their lifetime.</p> <p>The sources of the tight labour markets in the late 1990s are similarly instructive, in a less happy way. They were built on a bubble \u2013 the IT and stock market bubble. When it burst in 2001, an inevitable recession followed. And while the 2001 recession was short and shallow, the recovery and expansion that followed was positively <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/bp214/\" title=\"\">anaemic</a> \u2013 the worst in post-second world war history. And the main source of this weakness was clear \u2013 a deficiency of aggregate demand that was so extreme that by 2003 Ben Bernanke (when he was a Fed governor but before he was the Fed chair) gave speeches trying to reassure people that the Fed could indeed push back against outright deflation if the need arose. In short, by the early 2000s it should have been crystal clear that demand-generation was a huge problem.</p> <p>The post-2001 recovery and expansion finally gained some steam \u2013 but only when aided by a $7 trillion bubble in housing wealth. Even with this boost, the unemployment rate and other measures of labour market health never got very close to the 1990s peaks. Inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom 70% fell in the last years of the expansion.</p> <p>In the end, the housing bubble burst, causing a financial crisis and (more important for most Americans and others) leaving a large hole in aggregate demand as households could no longer support consumption by borrowing against the value of their homes. This hole was never adequately filled in, leaving the recovery slow and still-incomplete a full seven years after the recession began.</p> <p>This leaves a key question: what does it all mean for policymaking?</p> <p>The chronic demand shortfall has lots of implications. Most immediately, the Fed needs to stop thinking that the US economy is constantly on the knife-edge of setting off wage and price inflation spirals if interest rates are kept too low for too long. The biggest wage problem in the US economy in recent decades is not they\u2019re always surging ahead, it\u2019s that it\u2019s quite hard to make them rise. Interest-rate tightening can wait until actual inflation is seen in the data.</p> <p>Policymakers need to resist putting deficit reduction above all other goals. Budget deficits do no damage when run during times of slack demand. When the economy is at the zero lower bound \u2013 when the interest rate is at or near zero \u2013 they boost demand in a system positively starved for it.</p> <p>Further, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a shortage of reasonable public investment projects to undertake. For example, we still don\u2019t price carbon in this economy, so private investments in energy efficiency and emissions mitigation are radically under-provided. Further afield, as Stiglitz noted, \u201cthe entire world needs to retrofit itself to face the reality of global warming\u201d.</p> <p>Given this, why not ramp up public investments in this area? The marginal return on the first billions we spend on such investments is near infinite in the insurance value it provides in protecting against climate disasters.</p> <p>Finally, we circle back to the rise in inequality that is a root cause of the chronic demand shortfall. The main reason (and a sufficient one) to try to check or even reverse the rise of inequality is simply that it\u2019s the most reliable way to boost the living standards of low- and moderate-income households. But it also turns out that if we reverse this rise in inequality, we may well go a long way to reversing the problem of chronic demand shortfalls.</p> <p>This is an ambitious, long-run project. The rise in inequality is at its root a decline in the bargaining power of low and moderate-wage workers. Reversing it will not happen through one-off increases in the minimum wage or the generosity of the wage subsidies. (Though I\u2019m in favour of both! And this year already in the US, five states and nine cities are considering raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.)</p> <p>A real reversal will occur only if there is a sustained, durable shift of economic power to low- and moderate wage workers. This in turn will happen only with policy levers across a wide range being pulled: expansionary macroeconomic policy to keep jobs markets tight, labour policy to set wage-floors and other protections for workers and to police violations.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s tax policy to make it less profitable for chief executives and highly paid managers to rig the rules of the game to tilt more money their way, regulatory policy to insure that the financial sector does not become a drain on economy-wide productivity in other areas. Also, we should look at international policy to ensure aggregate demand is not exported away to countries that manage the value of their own currencies for competitive gain. Finally, a restoration of workers\u2019 rights to form unions and to bargain collectively.</p> <p>Ambitious, yes, but worth doing, not just for the sake of fairness, but for the sake of economic growth and stability.</p> <p><em>Josh Bivens is the director of research and policy at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ade093db1f3bd5cfb0fcfc4f93033ebeb3908ca9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ade093db1f3bd5cfb0fcfc4f93033ebeb3908ca9/0_90_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, announces that the Federal Reserve is raising its benchmark interest rate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen, announces that the Federal Reserve is raising its benchmark interest rate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
