      "bodyText": "Vodafone may still be negotiating its $130bn (\u00a384bn) exit from the US, but the prospect of a Verizon Wireless sale is already prompting speculation that the British mobile phone group could itself become a target for a similarly sized acquisition. With much of Vodafone's value tied up in its 45% stake in Verizon, speculation is now focusing on what will happen to the corporate rump that remains once the transaction is complete. Chief executive Vittorio Colao has embarked on a strategy to take Vodafone into the fixed-line broadband and TV market in Europe, and industry observers say he has two choices: to continue building the company he first worked for 13 years ago, or to sell it. America's AT&amp;T and Japan's Softbank, which recently acquired a US network, are both embracing international expansion and their names are now being touted as potential Vodafone suitors. \"Vodafone might also now be in play,\" wrote strategists at Olivetree. They added: \"[AT&amp;T] have been actively on the search for European deals and reportedly have already been rebuffed in their attempts to do some form of transaction with [O2 owner] Telefonica \u2026 Vodafone would not only be a smaller deal but come with a better balance sheet.\" Robin Bienenstock, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said AT&amp;T could pay \u00a380bn for the remaining Vodafone business, which stretches from the UK to Italy, and from Turkey to South Africa. \"With all that is happening in Europe AT&amp;T's appetite to use its shares to do a deal must be rising,\" Bienenstock wrote. \"The global M&amp;A context and the likelihood that Vodafone would immediately be in play mean that Vodafone requires a solid post-deal plan beyond a special dividend and a few European acquisitions,\" she warned. For now, the plan involves adding to the miles of internet cables Vodafone already owns following its purchase last year of the UK parts of Cable &amp; Wireless. Next up is Kabel Deutschland, a deal that awaits approval by European regulators. For James Barford at Enders Analysis, the best strategy for Vodafone is to improve the assets it owns. That means increasing the amount of cash spent upgrading the network to 4G, ensuring mobile internet coverage is faster and more widespread. \"The best choice is to invest more in being aggressive around 4G because if anyone is going to buy Vodafone, that is what they would do,\" said Barford. \"AT&amp;T has already said very publicly it doesn't think the Europeans are investing enough in 4G.\" It is a strategy that has already allowed AT&amp;T and Verizon to become America's largest mobile providers, with subscribers flocking to their superior networks as they upgrade in a way that smaller operators simply cannot afford. \"The opportunity is to create a clear blue water between your network quality and the network quality offered by discount operators,\" said Barford.",

      "bodyText": "In their spare time Vodafone chief executives manage the operations. The real job, or so it seems, has always been about moving pieces around the global telecoms chessboard, meaning buying and selling assets. Sir Christopher Gent got the show on the road with his vast turn-of-the-century accumulation of businesses, first AirTouch in the US and then Mannesmann in Germany \u2013 still the biggest corporate transaction of all time at $200bn (\u00a3130bn). His successor, Arun Sarin, tried to create order within the empire, pulling out of Japan but still leaving a company that too closely resembled a telecoms investment trust for many tastes. Vittorio Colao, the current incumbent, speeded things up by selling the 44% stake in SFR in France and the pointless 3.3% holding in China Mobile. Now he stands on the brink of the big one \u2013 the sale of the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless in the US, a holding that morphed out of the AirTouch acquisition and which has been the best investment Vodafone ever made. The City's view seems clear: if Verizon Communications, owner of the other 55% of Verizon Wireless, is offering $130bn, Colao should take the money. It's not an unreasonable view. A couple of years ago analysts touted $60bn-$65bn as a \"good\" price for 45% of Verizon Wireless. Even at the start of this year, the US firm seemed to think $100bn might tempt Vodafone. Against those yardsticks, $130bn would indeed be pretty if the capital gains tax bill can be kept below $10bn. But what we've learned over the years is never to rush to judgment on Vodafone's deal-making. AirTouch turned out brilliantly but the timing on Mannesmann, Gent's supposed masterstroke, was awful: Vodafone half-drowned in the torrent of shares issued to fund the deal. As for the much maligned Sarin, the best thing he did was to resist the clamour to get out of Verizon Wireless. Is the best call now really to sell, even at $130bn? The share price, a notch above 200p for the first time in a decade, says that's what Vodafone shareholders want, provided a chunk of the proceeds is turned into a huge special dividend. So Colao has a mandate to negotiate. But, if a sale happens, wait half a decade to determine if it was the right move. Everybody wants to sell at the top, but few manage it, and here Colao would be saying goodbye to Vodafone's best asset by a mile \u2013 a large stake in the best mobile operator in the world's biggest market. The alarming part, from the point of view of Vodafone shareholders, is that Verizon Communications' investors don't seem remotely perturbed by the prospect of shelling out $130bn. Verizon's share price rose slightly on news of the talks. If Vodafone is really taking Verizon to the cleaners, that should not happen. Colao should take note. He should not be afraid to say no, especially if the US firm wants to pay a large portion of the bill in funny-money preference shares. Time to cut Serco down to size? What should outsourcing firm Serco have done differently? Not sounded quite so smug, for a start. Try this corporate boast: \"Our products and processes differentiate us from our competitors. But this goes deeper. The fundamental difference at Serco comes from the unique culture and values that underpin the way we run the company and the way we behave.\" Serco chief executive Christopher Hyman, almost everybody agrees, is a honourable chap who is sincere about such stuff. Indeed, that is how he comes across in person. The question, though, is whether Hyman and his senior colleagues know what goes on in their company, which has 120,000 employees. As police were summoned this week to investigate alleged fraudulent behaviour by Serco staff managing a \u00a340m-a-year prisoner-escort contract, justice secretary Chris Grayling issued an extraordinary statement for a government minister: \"It's become very clear that there has been a culture within parts of Serco that has been totally unacceptable, and actions which need to be investigated by the police.\" As Grayling did not have to remind us, it's been one thing after another at Serco this year. The company, with G4S, was already being investigated over alleged over-charging on a tagging contract. There has also been a withering official assessment of the state of Serco-operated Thameside prison. And the public accounts committee called the company's operation of the out-of-hours GP services in Cornwall substandard. The charitable view is that Serco has been unlucky in the sense that bad news has arrived in a flood. Don't all large companies have a few accidents? Isn't the company's long-term record still excellent? Aren't private contractors always held to greater account than the public sector? And, remember, all the facts aren't yet in on tagging and prisoner-escorting. Well, we'll see. At present, the contrast is stark. On one hand, the company seems to want to maintain that its ethical framework is intact. On the other, Grayling says corporate renewal is necessary. Any middle ground there is hard to spot. The best guess is that Hyman will be able to persuade Grayling's panel in three months' time that Serco has been \"renewed\" and is thus fit to continue as a government contractor. That's assuming no more damaging tales emerge. But the other strand in Grayling's statements is an encouragement to smaller outsourcing firms to bid. Good idea. Some of these giant companies start to look too big to manage effectively. \"We didn't know, and we're appalled,\" has become an irritating chorus from big-company boardrooms too often recently. Maybe part of the problem is size. Labour must move on HS2 Ed Miliband needs to get a firm policy on HS2, the proposed \u00a350bn (and counting) high-speed railway line. It's make-your-mind-up time. Former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling has come out against, and even the Institute of Directors this week called the project a \"grand folly\". They're right, as has been argued here more than once: other transport projects offer better value for money. Labour, officially, is still in favour, but the statements are becoming woollier. A U-turn would be embarrassing since the last Labour government dreamed up the project (based on \"almost entirely speculative\" estimates, according to Lord Mandelson) but not as embarrassing as continuing to offer lukewarm support to an idea that seems destined to go nowhere. George Osborne is determined to resuscitate the campaign in favour of HS2. That should be Labour's cue to call for a full rethink. It's a knockout The word Mark Carney barely used during his trip to Nottingham was \"knockout.\" One can understand why. If you are painting a dovish picture on interest rates by describing the economic recovery as \"fledgling\" and stressing how long it will take to get unemployment down to 7%, it's best not to remind the market of the circumstances under which borrowing costs might nevertheless rise. The trouble is, investors remember the so-called \"knockout\" clauses adopted by the monetary policy committee. If inflation looks likely to be 2.5% or higher in one-and-a-half to two years' time, the 7% unemployment threshold becomes irrelevant. As M&amp;G's Jim Leaviss points out, since the start of 2010 there have been only three months of sub 2.5% inflation, thus the market's scepticism about forward guidance and the refusal (so far) to lower gilt yields. As Leaviss says, it looks as if the currency and gilt markets will need something stronger before they deliver the easing Carney wants. The new governor has got a real problem.",

      "body": "<p>It may have been the warmest and dryest UK summer since 2006, but August's stock market performance was rather more unsettled.</p> <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> fell more than 3% over the month, hit by continuing concerns that the US Federal Reserve could soon turn off the money taps and, latterly, fears of a military strike on Syria. On top of that, the eurozone crisis was still bubbling away, with talk that Greece might need a third bailout and worries about the outlook once the German elections are out of the way.</p> <p>The leading index closed at 6412.9 yesterday, down 70 points or 1% on the day; also down 1% on the bank holiday week. Michael Hewson, senior analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"Why would any investor want to buy the current dips when the level of uncertainty remains so high?\"</p> <p>Oil rose to a high of $116 a barrel during the month on concerns about supply disruptions if the Middle East erupts into more violence, putting pressure on airlines, which could face higher jet fuel costs as a result. British Airways owner <strong>International Airlines Group</strong> fell 2% to 286.3p yesterday, while <strong>easyJet</strong> also dropped 2% to \u00a312.33. But analysts at Jefferies were unconcerned: \"Geopolitical uncertainties are an investment hazard in the airline industry and the current situation presents an interesting opportunity to invest on attractive valuations. Fuel accounts for 30%-45% of total costs, depending on the airline. But hedging can (and is at the moment) providing near-term protection from volatile, rising prices.\"</p> <p>It said IAG, for example, was 85% hedged for the second half of 2013: \"Clearly the current position of political uncertainty is not helpful to investors. Historically, we have seen before how stocks hit by geopolitical threats (like the volcanic ash cloud and the Arab spring) can bounce back quickly too.\"</p> <p>The market's fall would have been worse if not for support from <strong>Vodafone</strong>. The mobile phone group added another 1.5p to 206p following confirmation on Thursday that it had restarted talks over the disposal of its 45% stake in its US joint venture, Verizon Wireless. Some analysts believe the stake could be worth $130bn.</p> <p>Outsourcing groups had a volatile week. <strong>Serco</strong> recovered more than 1.5% to 547.5p yesterday after an 11% fall on Thursday in the wake of news that justice secretary Chris Grayling had called in police to investigate alleged fraud by the company's staff working on a \u00a3285m prisoner escorting contract. Serco said it had discovered misreporting on the contract but found no evidence that management knew about the problem. It will repay \u00a32m of profit on the contract and forgo any future benefits. Chief executive Chris Hyman said he was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" and would instititute a programme of change.</p> <p>Rival <strong>G4S</strong>, which, along with Serco, was accused of having charged the government for tagging criminals who were dead or in prison, took steps to rebuild its balance sheet during the week. The company's new chief executive, Ashley Almanza, unveiled a \u00a3348m cash call at 247p a share. It plans to sell assets and concentrate on developing its emerging market business. It closed up more than 3% at 260p yesterday.</p> <p>A consortium bid for Severn Trent may have failed recently, but that might not be the end of takeover attempts in the sector, according to analysts at JP Morgan, who said:\"We would not rule out M&amp;A in the sector with debt costs low and no immediate risk of the regulator moving to a company specific cost of capital.\"</p> <p>Leaving any takeover speculation aside, JP Morgan was particularly keen on <strong>Pennon</strong>, mainly due to its non-water business.</p> <p>Elsewhere, online gaming group <strong>bwin.party</strong> plunged 13.5% to 110p after it warned full year revenue would fall by up to 17% as it focuses on fewer markets. Half-year earnings fell a third to \u20ac60.7m, hit by a turnover tax on sports betting in Germany.

      "bodyText": "It may have been the warmest and dryest UK summer since 2006, but August's stock market performance was rather more unsettled. The FTSE 100 fell more than 3% over the month, hit by continuing concerns that the US Federal Reserve could soon turn off the money taps and, latterly, fears of a military strike on Syria. On top of that, the eurozone crisis was still bubbling away, with talk that Greece might need a third bailout and worries about the outlook once the German elections are out of the way. The leading index closed at 6412.9 yesterday, down 70 points or 1% on the day; also down 1% on the bank holiday week. Michael Hewson, senior analyst at CMC Markets, said: \"Why would any investor want to buy the current dips when the level of uncertainty remains so high?\" Oil rose to a high of $116 a barrel during the month on concerns about supply disruptions if the Middle East erupts into more violence, putting pressure on airlines, which could face higher jet fuel costs as a result. British Airways owner International Airlines Group fell 2% to 286.3p yesterday, while easyJet also dropped 2% to \u00a312.33. But analysts at Jefferies were unconcerned: \"Geopolitical uncertainties are an investment hazard in the airline industry and the current situation presents an interesting opportunity to invest on attractive valuations. Fuel accounts for 30%-45% of total costs, depending on the airline. But hedging can (and is at the moment) providing near-term protection from volatile, rising prices.\" It said IAG, for example, was 85% hedged for the second half of 2013: \"Clearly the current position of political uncertainty is not helpful to investors. Historically, we have seen before how stocks hit by geopolitical threats (like the volcanic ash cloud and the Arab spring) can bounce back quickly too.\" The market's fall would have been worse if not for support from Vodafone. The mobile phone group added another 1.5p to 206p following confirmation on Thursday that it had restarted talks over the disposal of its 45% stake in its US joint venture, Verizon Wireless. Some analysts believe the stake could be worth $130bn. Outsourcing groups had a volatile week. Serco recovered more than 1.5% to 547.5p yesterday after an 11% fall on Thursday in the wake of news that justice secretary Chris Grayling had called in police to investigate alleged fraud by the company's staff working on a \u00a3285m prisoner escorting contract. Serco said it had discovered misreporting on the contract but found no evidence that management knew about the problem. It will repay \u00a32m of profit on the contract and forgo any future benefits. Chief executive Chris Hyman said he was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" and would instititute a programme of change. Rival G4S, which, along with Serco, was accused of having charged the government for tagging criminals who were dead or in prison, took steps to rebuild its balance sheet during the week. The company's new chief executive, Ashley Almanza, unveiled a \u00a3348m cash call at 247p a share. It plans to sell assets and concentrate on developing its emerging market business. It closed up more than 3% at 260p yesterday. A consortium bid for Severn Trent may have failed recently, but that might not be the end of takeover attempts in the sector, according to analysts at JP Morgan, who said:\"We would not rule out M&amp;A in the sector with debt costs low and no immediate risk of the regulator moving to a company specific cost of capital.\" Leaving any takeover speculation aside, JP Morgan was particularly keen on Pennon, mainly due to its non-water business. Elsewhere, online gaming group bwin.party plunged 13.5% to 110p after it warned full year revenue would fall by up to 17% as it focuses on fewer markets. Half-year earnings fell a third to \u20ac60.7m, hit by a turnover tax on sports betting in Germany. James Hollins at Investec kept a buy recommendation but said: \"Bwin.party has developed an unfortunate reputation of missing expectations, with the first-half results confirming the fears of bulls like us that this issue has yet to be consigned to history.

      "bodyText": "Youth unemployment in Spain has reached a new high of 56.1%, a quarter of the 3.5 million under-25s jobless across the eurozone, according to the latest Eurostat figures. The number of young Spaniards belonging to what has become known as the lost generation is up 2% since June to 883,000. Only Greece has a higher percentage of young people out of work, at 62.9%. Among adult males, Spain has the highest unemployment at 25.3%, higher even than Greece. Despite the government's claims that the worst has passed and that employment reforms will encourage firms to hire, the figures suggest it will be a long time before any upturn in the economy is reflected in a declining jobless rate. With the holiday season coming to a close, the numbers are likely to rise as workers on seasonal contracts go back on the dole. With close to six million Spaniards out of work, unemployment is so entrenched that there was no political reaction to the latest figures, neither from government nor the opposition. Indeed, mentioning the economy at all has become virtually taboo across the political spectrum. Meanwhile, Spaniards and recent immigrants are deserting the country in search of work, with 500,000 leaving in 2012, 60,000 of them Spanish nationals, most of them to Latin America and Europe. The total number of unemployed across the eurozone is 19.2 million, 15,000 fewer than in June. Across the EU the figure was 26.7 million, down 33,000 from June. However, it has remained at a record rate of 12.1% for the fourth months. The overall rate across the eurozone is 11%, half a percentage point up on last year. Italy saw a small fall to 12%, while the lowest rates among member states are Austria (4.8%), Germany (5.3%) and Luxembourg (5.7%). The rate in the US is 7.4% and in Japan 3.8%. As the continent still grapples with the effects of the financial crisis five years on, a board member of the German central bank warned that the European financial system is still not equipped to cope with a bank failure of a similar magnitude to 2008's collapse of Lehman Brothers. \"If we had a Lehman 2.0 tomorrow, which I don't see, we still wouldn't hold the tools we designed to wind down banks globally effectively in our hands,\" said Andreas Dombret of Germany's Bundesbank. Some progress had been made and the system is now safer than in 2008, but implementation is slow, said Dombret, who is in charge of the financial stability portfolio on the German central bank's board. He added: \"More than anything, we have bought time with a number of unconventional measures. That's why financial markets are currently calm, but it doesn't have to stay like that forever.\" The bankruptcy of US investment bank Lehman plunged the global financial system into crisis, leading to a raft of new rules aimed at making banks' business less risky to avoid taxpayer-funded rescues. The European Central Bank's vow a year ago to do \"whatever it takes\" to preserve the single currency, the euro, took some heat out of the debt crisis, but it also eased pressure on struggling eurozone countries to reform, according to Dombret.",

Martin van Vliet at ING said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The...data confirms that the region is in a tentative recovery and that inflationary pressures generally remain very muted. The increase in the European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator for the 17-country region, from 92.5 in July to 95.2 in August, was much stronger than had been expected.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Eurostat reported that the number of jobless in the 17-country region fell for a second straight month in July. Eurozone inflation fell from 1.6% in July to just 1.3% in August. The decline was largely driven by a sharp fall in energy price inflation. At current oil prices ($116 per barrel) eurozone headline inflation should remain below 2% throughout the remainder of this year and next, as food price inflation eases further and core inflation continues to be held down by still significant excess capacity across the region. But this scenario would obviously change if events surrounding Syria were to push up oil prices sharply further.<br>All in all, it is encouraging to see that unemployment is no longer rising and that economic sentiment is moving in the right direction. But the tentative recovery is vulnerable to new economic shocks, either in the form of a renewed flare up of the eurocrisis, a sharp, BRICs-led slowdown in global growth or increased geopolitical tensions. The ECB is surely aware of this. So although further monetary easing by the ECB has become less likely, ECB-president Draghi will probably continue to strike a cautious tone at ECB press conferences.</p> </blockquote> <p>Timo del Carpioo at RBC Europe said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The absence of a major change to the aggregate level picture underscores the reality that, despite the gradual improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop, it will take time for the rebound in sentiment to feed through to actual hiring decisions. While the euro area is in the cusp of a recovery, domestic headwinds will clearly temper the pace of at which it exits from the recession. This in turn suggests that labour market challenges will continue to be a focal point for policy discussions going forward\u2013\u2013at both national and European level.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-30T10:22:14.170Z\">at 11.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52206877e4b0b76ce52c7837\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-30T09:41:43.512Z\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Youth unemployment remains high</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a detailed breakdown of the youth unemployment figures, with the Spanish level now standing at 56%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-accf94f1-ce51-49ac-977a-f62c5b2242a4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/30/1377855604181/530e3d89-d511-4829-a65a-652f42f8eb70-460x382.png\" alt=\"Youth unemployment in the EU and eurozone\" width=\"460\" height=\"382\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Youth unemployment in the EU and eurozone</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-08-30T12:42:10.381Z\">at 1.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52206621e4b01790173db5ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-08-30T09:35:35.967Z\">10.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion called on the EU to step up its jobs efforts, in the wake of the latest jobless numbers.

The slight decline in unemployment in these countries shows the importance of active employment policy measures like hiring subsidies, reduced taxes on low-paid labour, re-skilling and good-quality job placement services.</p> <p>But clearly it is unacceptable that more than 26.6m jobseekers are still without a job in the EU (19.2m in the eurozone), of which more than 5.5m are aged under 25 (3.5m in the eurozone). The recent improvements are minimal, and the situation is still very fragile. This is no time for celebration or complacency.

In July, German retail sales dropped by 1.4% month on month in real terms. This was the second consecutive drop. On the year, however, retail sales were up by 2.3%.<br>Over the last years, private consumption has become a silent but important helper for the German economy. Since the beginning of last year, private consumption has grown by an average of 0.2% QoQ each quarter. Record high employment, wage increases and the general feeling to indulge oneself have driven private consumption.<br>Looking ahead, the fundamentals for continued solid private consumption growth remain intact. However, today\u2019s numbers are a first setback. Even if the share of retail sales in German private consumption has dropped from around 35% to currently 28%, today\u2019s drop does not bode well for private consumption in the third quarter. In addition, two new factors have called for some caution: consumer confidence dropped this week for the first time since February and, much more important, the latest increase in oil prices. In the past, high oil prices have often turned out to be the main predator of German consumers.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-62be9dd7-6076-479f-bc62-542ea285d1ce\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/30/1377847112477/aa16c10f-4de6-4ffd-924a-22faef2fd17a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A shopping arcade in Hamburg, as German retail sales came in below forecasts.

Workers are getting scorched by the new Walkie Talkie skyscraper focusing a sharp ray of sun onto the pavement. Either it's marking the spot for the second coming (on Eastcheap near Monument tube), or the builders might have some explaining to do. Journalists at City AM headed out with a light reader, recording readings six times higher than in direct sunlight elsewhere in the City. But building co-developer told the newspaper We took advice on such matters during the design stages of the project and are satisfied that steps have been taken to ensure such risks have been mitigated. Oil prices are still on track for their biggest monthly gain in a year, as Brent Crude is up more than 6% in August. However, the UK Parliament's decision not to endorse getting involved in any Syrian conflict stalled prices, which sit at $114.95 a barrel, down 0.18%. Traders had expected a British intervention to force up the price as supply would be disrupted by any fighting. Light Crude is down 0.65% at $109.09 a barrel. The price is still reasonably steady, as the world waits to see what US Defence Secretary John Kerry has to say later this afternoon, but could shoot up if an intervention looks inevitable. Over to Brazil, one of the countries touted to take part in a coordinated intervention in offshore currency markets, where GDP growth came in higher than expected. Finance Minister Guido Mantega said Brazil's economy is likely headed back to healthy average growth rates, after Q2 GDP was up 1.5%, ahead of 0.9% expectations. Earlier this month he reduced 2013 growth targets to 2.5% from an already reduced 3.0%, and for 2014 down to 4.0% from 4.5%. The European Commission has just tweeted an interesting map showing where the EU has some form of trade agreement. And a positive consumer sentiment survey from the US. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index rose from a preliminary reading of 80 for August to 82.1, compared to a consensus of 80.5. And on that note I'm handing over to my colleague Simon Neville. More US data, this time the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index which came in at 53 for August, up from 52.3 in July. This was in line with expectations, and has helped the Dow Jones erase some of its decline following the earlier mixed spending and inflation figures. The Dow is now down just 7 points having lost around 15 points at the open. Still with India, the country is talking to other emerging economies about a co-ordinated intervention in offshore currency markets following a recent rout, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters: \"It is now time to stop,\" Dipak Dasgupta, the ministry's principal economic adviser, told Reuters, referring to the speculation he said was damaging the stability of the world economy. Dasgupta said there had been correspondence among the countries on the plans in the last few weeks and predicted action would come quickly, but he declined to share specific details of the discussions. \"It is going to happen in a matter of days rather than weeks,\" he said. \" Brazil and India can start the move.\" With the rupee on the slide. Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has stepped in to try and reassure investors in the country. Full story on the site but here's a flavour: Singh, an economist credited with leading a crucial wave of reforms in the early 1990s but recently widely criticised for inactivity, said India was not facing a repeat of a balance of payments crisis that shook the country in 1991 and said fears that economic growth could slip to as low as 3% were unfounded. \"There is no reason for anybody to believe that we are going down the hill and that 1991 is on the horizon,\" he told parliament. Over in the US, consumer spending edged up 0.1% in July from 0.6% the previous month, while inflation as measured by the consumer price index rose 0.1% after a 0.4% increase in June. So with benign inflation but weak spending, analysts will be trying to work out what it all means for any easing of the US Federal Reserve's bond buying programme. Well here's a cheery thought, courtesy of Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret. Five years after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the European banking system is still not equipped to cope with a similiar sized banking failure, Dombret told Reuters. He said the system was safer than in 2008 - when Lehman went under - but implementation was slow. Dombret, who is in charge of financial stability at the German central bank, said: If we had a Lehman 2.0 tomorrow, which I don't see, we still wouldn't hold the tools we designed to wind down banks globally effectively in our hands. More than anything, we have bought time with a number of unconventional measures. That's why financial markets are currently calm, but it doesn't have to stay like that forever. I'm not entirely happy with the implementation of the already agreed regulatory measures. There is no room for complacency. Cyprus will not need more aid beyond the \u20ac10bn already agreed, according to president Nikos Anastasiadis. He said in an interview with Germany's Handelsblatt: If we maintain budget discipline and use our chances we will not need additional funds. I hope there will be first signs of a turn around in the second half of 2014. Of course the crisis will not be over then, but I am sure that we can return to financial markets before the end of the program in 2016. (Courtesy MNI in Franfurt) After the Libor scandal comes Nibor. Norway's finance ministry has called for the country's interbank lending rate to come under government control amid fears it has been manipulated. Reuters reports: The Norwegian banking regulator should bring the setting of the benchmark Norwegian interbank lending rate under government control due to concerns that the rate could be manipulated, the finance ministry said on Friday. The decision follows calls for tighter regulation by the regulator in April after the central bank said some foreign banks had complained about suspected manipulation of Nibor, the Norwegian Interbank Offered Rate, which many bonds are linked to. The central bank has refused to disclose the names of these lenders. The financial regulator said it had not found evidence of rate-rigging, but neither could it rule out that rigging could have happened. \"The finance ministry has today asked the Financial Supervisory Authority to draft new rules to bring its benchmark interest rate under government regulation and supervision,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding the draft should be ready by the end of March next year. Overall this latest batch of eurozone data - unemployment, business sentiment and inflation - show signs of a recovery in the region, say analysts, although this could yet be derailed. Martin van Vliet at ING said: The...data confirms that the region is in a tentative recovery and that inflationary pressures generally remain very muted. The increase in the European Commission\u2019s economic sentiment indicator for the 17-country region, from 92.5 in July to 95.2 in August, was much stronger than had been expected. Meanwhile, Eurostat reported that the number of jobless in the 17-country region fell for a second straight month in July. Eurozone inflation fell from 1.6% in July to just 1.3% in August. The decline was largely driven by a sharp fall in energy price inflation. At current oil prices ($116 per barrel) eurozone headline inflation should remain below 2% throughout the remainder of this year and next, as food price inflation eases further and core inflation continues to be held down by still significant excess capacity across the region. But this scenario would obviously change if events surrounding Syria were to push up oil prices sharply further. All in all, it is encouraging to see that unemployment is no longer rising and that economic sentiment is moving in the right direction. But the tentative recovery is vulnerable to new economic shocks, either in the form of a renewed flare up of the eurocrisis, a sharp, BRICs-led slowdown in global growth or increased geopolitical tensions. The ECB is surely aware of this. So although further monetary easing by the ECB has become less likely, ECB-president Draghi will probably continue to strike a cautious tone at ECB press conferences. Timo del Carpioo at RBC Europe said: The absence of a major change to the aggregate level picture underscores the reality that, despite the gradual improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop, it will take time for the rebound in sentiment to feed through to actual hiring decisions. While the euro area is in the cusp of a recovery, domestic headwinds will clearly temper the pace of at which it exits from the recession. This in turn suggests that labour market challenges will continue to be a focal point for policy discussions going forward\u2013\u2013at both national and European level. Here's a detailed breakdown of the youth unemployment figures, with the Spanish level now standing at 56%: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Andor, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion called on the EU to step up its jobs efforts, in the wake of the latest jobless numbers. He said: GDP growth turned positive in the 2nd quarter and latest unemployment figures confirm that joblessness has stopped rising in many countries, even in Spain, Portugal and Ireland. After six quarters of recession and ten quarters of rising unemployment, this levelling off in unemployment is relatively good news. It is encouraging that many countries have managed to slightly reduce seasonally-adjusted unemployment without a time lag after economic growth picked up or even while still in recession. The slight decline in unemployment in these countries shows the importance of active employment policy measures like hiring subsidies, reduced taxes on low-paid labour, re-skilling and good-quality job placement services. But clearly it is unacceptable that more than 26.6m jobseekers are still without a job in the EU (19.2m in the eurozone), of which more than 5.5m are aged under 25 (3.5m in the eurozone). The recent improvements are minimal, and the situation is still very fragile. This is no time for celebration or complacency. On the contrary, now that we can see we are on the right employment policy track we must step up our 'jobs effort'. The budding recovery also reflects several recent broader policy shifts, which must be consolidated and continued to overcome the financial and economic crisis: progress on reforming the euro zone, including banking union; innovative actions of the ECB and moderation of fiscal consolidation. Some early comments on the jobless data, again highlighting the plight of Europe's youth. And here's a country by country breakdown (apologies for the small type - the full verion is available from Eurostat here): More detail on the unemployment figures. Eurostat estimates that 26.654m men and women were unemployed in the EU, 19.231m in the eurozone. This was a decrease of 33,000 on June in the EU and 15,000 in the euro area. Compared with July 2012, unemployment rose by 995,000 in the EU and by 1.008m in the euro area. Meanwhile eurzone inflation is expected to be 1.5% in August, according to Eurostat, down from 1.6% in July. Meawhile business confidence in the eurozone improved in August, despite the stubbornly high jobless numbers. The measure of sentiment increased by 2.7 points to 95.2. Eurozone unemployment was steady at 12.1% in July, pretty much in line with expectations. Among the member states, the lowest unemployment levels were in Austria, Germany and Luxembourg, and the highest in Greece and Spain. Youth unemployment continued to edge higher, up from 23.3% a year ago to 23.4 UK mortgage lending rose to its highest level in five years last month, and even business lending was on the rise. Helped by government incentives to help home buyers, mortgage approvals rose from 58,238 in June to 60,624 last month. Lending to firms rose by \u00a30.5bn in July, the first increase since January. The figures come after Nationwide reported a 0.6% rise in house prices in August and Bank of England governor Mark Carney said he would act to prevent any property bubble. Ahead of the overall eurone unemployment data, Italy's seasonally adjusted jobless rate has dipped to 12% in July from 12.1% the month before. But it remains close to May's record high of 12.2%, and youth unemployment rose for the second month in a row to 39.5% from 39%. Portuguese bond yields are on the rise after the country's constitutional court dealt a blow to the government's austerity drive. The court rejected a bill late yesterday that would have effectively allowed the state to fire public sector workers. According to Reuters, the bill would have had little direct impact on the country's budget deficit in 2014 but it was important because of its potential longer term structural effect. Investors may now be alarmed that the court might throw out other planned austerity measures, putting at risk Portugal's deficit targets, set as part of its EU/IMF bailout agreement. The country's 10 year bond yields are currently up 14 basis points at 6.818%. The UK market has got off to a slow start following last night's vote by MPs against military action on Syria, with the FTSE 100 up just 1.80 points at 6484.05. To follow the latest developments on Syria, our Middle East blog has all the latest developments here. Analysts expect a reasonably quiet day on the markets, especially ahead of a long weekend for the US where Wall Street is closed on Monday for Labor Day, athough that might be tempting fate of course. So Germany's Dax is down 12.28 points or 0.15% while France's Cac has dipped 7.87 points or 0.2%. Italy's FTSE MIB is off 0.66% while Spain's Ibex is down 0.77%. US futures are currently showing a 26 point gain on the Dow. Gold has slipped $12 an ounce to $1394 while Brent crude is some 0.6% lower at $114 a barrel, as the likelihood of an imminent attact on Syria eases. Although President Obama may well now make a move anyway, even without the help of other governments. German retail sales were worse than expected in July, showing a month on month fall of 1.4% compared to forecasts of a 0.5% rise. But the year on year figure beat expectations of a 2% increase, rising 2.3%. Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said: Weak start of the third quarter. In July, German retail sales dropped by 1.4% month on month in real terms. This was the second consecutive drop. On the year, however, retail sales were up by 2.3%. Over the last years, private consumption has become a silent but important helper for the German economy. Since the beginning of last year, private consumption has grown by an average of 0.2% QoQ each quarter. Record high employment, wage increases and the general feeling to indulge oneself have driven private consumption. Looking ahead, the fundamentals for continued solid private consumption growth remain intact. However, today\u2019s numbers are a first setback. Even if the share of retail sales in German private consumption has dropped from around 35% to currently 28%, today\u2019s drop does not bode well for private consumption in the third quarter. In addition, two new factors have called for some caution: consumer confidence dropped this week for the first time since February and, much more important, the latest increase in oil prices. In the past, high oil prices have often turned out to be the main predator of German consumers. On the eurozone unemployment figures, Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: The unemployment rate for July, also due out, is also expected to remain high at 12.1%, just below the record high seen a couple of months ago. Given that we\u2019ve seen unemployment levels slip back a little in countries like Spain recently there is a chance of a drop, but given seasonality factors any move lower could well be temporary in nature as the tourist season comes to an end, and temporary contracts start to roll off in September. James Howat at Capital Economics sees a similar outcome: Although the number of jobless fell by 24,000 in June, surveys and timelier national data suggest that the labour market may see a renewed, albeit small, deterioration in July. That said, while the jobless count may rise a little, it may not be enough to push the unemployment rate above its last reading of 12.1%. Here are some of today's expected events: UK 9:30 (BST) M4 Money Supply (year on year) (July) UK 9:30 Net Consumer Credit (July) UK 9:30 Net Lending to Individuals (July) UK 9:30 Mortgage Approvals (July) Eurozone 10:00 Unemployment Rate (July) Eurozone 10:00 Industrial Confidence (August) Eurozone 10:00 Consumer Price Index (year on year) (August) Eurozone 10:00 Consumer Confidence (August) Germany 7:00 Retail Sales (July) US 13:30 Personal Spending (July) US 14:45 Chicago PMI (August) US 14:55 Reuters/Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (August) Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the global economy and the eurozone. With continuing uncertainty over Syria, Asian markets edged lower again overnight. The Nikkei 225 closed down 0.53% at 13,388, while the Hang Seng lost 0.13%. Despite the UK parliament voting against taking action against the Syrian government, investors remain cautious about the prospects of action in the area. So the FTSE 100 futures are indicating a 0.1% fall when the market opens shortly. On the economic front, Japanese consumer prices index rose to an annual rate of 0.7% in July, its highest level in 5 years thanks to rising energy price. Meanwhile industrial production grew 3.2%, below forecasts of a 3.6% rise. Later come eurozone unemployment figures, as day after higher than expected German jobless numbers. Already there have been some disappointing German retail figures, of which more shortly. In the UK, consumer confidence seems to have picked up while the British Chamber of Commerce has raised its growth forecasts. My colleague Heather Stewart has the full story here. House prices rose by 0.6% in August according to the Nationwide. Details here. And after his performance in Nottingham this week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has given an interview to the Daily Mail in which he says he will step in to avert any housing market bubble.",

      "bodyText": "The economic gloom still hanging over Europe has not stopped wealthy Asian shoppers boosting the coffers of some of the most expensive luxury brands in the world. They are flocking to bag-to-belt maker Herm\u00e8s and Italian shoemaker Ferragamo in record numbers, with both companies reporting a boost in sales and profits. Herm\u00e8s, best known for its \u00a34,500 Birkin bag favoured by Victoria Beckham and Julia Roberts, saw sales rise 11% to \u20ac1.77bn (\u00a31.5bn) as operating profits soared 14% to \u20ac584.1m for the first half of the year. The results gave the group an impressive 33% profit margin, which would be a record for the company if it is maintained for the rest of the year. Demand for silk scarves was strong, with Asian customers particularly keen to keep up the insatiable appetite for luxury goods in south-east Asia. However, watch sales fell. Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, grew 17%, but they rose by 13% in France and 15% in the rest of Europe thanks in part to Asian tourists taking items back home. Luxury shoemaker Ferragamo also saw a healthy boost in sales, up 11% to \u20ac625m (\u00a3533m), as Asian shoppers and well-heeled tourists in Europe snapped up its wares. The Asia Pacific region is now the best-selling area for the company, which counts Lady Gaga and Angelina Jolie among its fans, accounting for 38% of sales \u2013 up 13%. European sales rose 14% and account for 26.7% of the total, but the company put the surprise rise down to wealthy Asian, Russian and Middle Eastern tourists. Net profits for the first six months of the year rose 81% to \u20ac81m. Several prominent luxury brands have reported strong sales across Asia, or see Asian tourist customers as a key driving force for their businesses. Last month Kering Group, owner of Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, saw sales in China jump 19%, while the British brand Burberry recently revealed double-digit growth in China and the opening of two new Shanghai stores. The Chinese city has become a firm favourite for international retailers hoping to break into the Chinese market and another retailer joined them on Friday. Floral print design brand Cath Kidston said it would open a three-storey, 557-sq-metre (6,000-sq-ft) store on Huai Hai Road selling a full range of homeware, accessories, clothing and childrenswear. The company is so popular in Asia, it now has more stores in south-east Asia than it has in the UK for the first time.",

    "webTitle": "BP accuses Louisiana leaders of 'political grandstanding' over oil spill", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BP has become embroiled in an acrimonious slanging match with one of the US Gulf states most affected by pollution from the Deepwater Horizon blowout in 2010 with the two sides trading blows over the oil company's cleanup record. A senior BP executive has accused the leaders of Louisiana of \"political grandstanding\" and making \"patently false assertions\" about the environmental record of the group since the spill. The row reflects BP's growing frustration after it failed again to persuade a judge it could limit compensation payments on the grounds of fraud and remains mired in a civil legal case with the US department of justice over the Macondo well. Geoff Morrell, BP's vice-president of US communications, responded to critical comments made by Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor, and one of his top officials, Garret Graves, at a meeting of the Gulf Coast restoration council. \"Their political grandstanding contains patently false assertions, defies the demonstrated record of environmental recovery that has occurred across the Gulf, and defames the massive efforts of tens of thousands of people to foster prompt recovery and restoration,\" said Morrell. It was an outburst that, coming after the relatively sober comments made by BP in the past, triggered an immediate response from Graves, showing neither side is in the mood for compromise. \"BP is not a victim of this disaster. No matter what they say or do, the families of the deceased and the citizens of the Gulf are the victims and we are going to fight to hold BP accountable for their actions. BP's campaign to portray themselves as the victim is shameless,\" he said in a response emailed to the Associated Press. \"For BP executives to try to call our concerns 'grandstanding' is laughable. They caused the worst oil spill in our nation's history, are doing the worst cleanup in our nation's history and we should sit idle and let them continue?\" During the restoration council meeting, Jindal had said BP had focused too much on its image and needed to turn its attention to covering restoration costs. He argued the oil company needed to stop spending hundreds of millions of dollars on its public relations campaign \"telling us how great they are and start proving it by addressing their Clean Water Act and Natural Resources Damage liabilities now\". But Morrell said that overall to date BP had spent more than $26bn (\u00a317bn) on response, cleanup and claims, adding: \"Repeated assertions that we have spent more money on advertising than this are grossly in error and seem purposefully intended to mislead the public.\" Oil industry executives with close links to BP said the company was happy to \"step up the rhetoric\" rather than continue to be used as a whipping post despite its financial commitments to help the southern states. It followed guidance given by Bob Dudley, BP's group chief executive, at the release of the company's recent financial results when he admitted BP was digging in for a long battle in the New Orleans courts over civil charges. BP had previously indicated it should be able to reach a reasonable out-of-court settlement with the department of justice, but its optimism has continually been shown to be misplaced. The London-based group was also hopeful it could obtain a court ruling to halt compensation payments amid its claims of fraud, but Judge Carl Barbier ruled there was no credible evidence to support those claims. Earlier this month the US federal energy regulatory commission (FERC) ordered BP to respond to allegations of natural gas market manipulation in Texas, threatening the energy company with fines of almost $29m. FERC pointed to a two-minute recorded conversation between a BP trainee and a senior gas trader as evidence that BP bought and sold gas at a possible loss in the physical market in order to increase the value of its derivatives position. \"These allegations are without merit and we stand by what we previously disclosed publicly in February 2011 \u2013 that BP natural gas traders did not engage in any market manipulation in late 2008. BP is disappointed that the FERC has brought this action and we will vigorously defend against these allegations,\" the company said. Spill bill Almost 5m barrels of oil gushed out of the stricken Macondo well in the US Gulf of Mexico, and BP has spent nearly $26bn (\u00a316.8bn) on compensation and the clean-up. The spill took nearly 90 days to halt following a blowout on the Deepwater Horizon rig and brought a torrent of legal cases that carry on to this day. Further payouts could result in a total bill of $40bn or more. More than $14bn has already gone on the immediate response to the accident, including a desperate attempt to remove tar from the beaches of the southern states. Another $11bn has been used to settle around 300,000 claims from individuals, businesses and state agencies affected by the country's worst ever offshore spill. Of this, $4.5bn has been spent on a plea agreement to settle criminal charges from the justice department and a civil case with the Wall Street regulator, the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission. There is still an ongoing civil case with the justice department plus claims from individual states, as well as companies and some individual claimants not party to anthe earlier major settlement. A second phase of the justice department case, under which BP could still be found guilty of a potentially-costly gross negligence charge, starts again next month.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England: consumers turn to loans, credit cards and overdrafts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Consumer credit grew last month at its fastest pace since December 2008, as households resorted to personal loans and overdrafts to maintain their standard of living in the face of falling real wages. Data from the Bank of England, released on Friday, show that the 3.5% annual increase in consumer credit, which includes borrowing on overdrafts, credit cards and unsecured loans, was the most rapid increase in four-and-a-half years. The fresh evidence of consumers' willingness to turn to costly borrowing on personal loans \u2013 which charge average rates of more than 7%, compared with the Bank's base rate of 0.5% \u2013 will increase fears that the UK is experiencing an unsustainable, \"Alice in Wongaland\" recovery, a phrase coined recently by the economist Ann Pettifor. Mortgage approvals for house purchase also rose, to 60,624, according to the Bank, the highest level since March 2008, when the worst of the financial crisis was yet to hit, in the latest sign that the housing market is picking up. David Tinsley of BNP Paribas said: \"The Bank of England's Inflation Report discussed that it was likely that approvals would rise 'above 60,0000 a month by the end of the year'. On today's evidence, this is happening at least as fast as that view. A level towards 70,000 by year-end looks achievable.\" Improved mortgage availability has helped prices to rise in many parts of the country, and Nationwide said on Friday that house prices rose by 0.6% in August. The latest snapshot of the property market by Britain's biggest building society, based on mortgages it approved over the month, put the average price of a home at \u00a3170,514 \u2013 more than \u00a38,000 higher than in January but still well below the 2007 peak of \u00a3186,044. Coupled with the turn in the housing market, the news that personal borrowing is increasing more rapidly will fuel the debate about whether the economic recovery is being built on solid foundations. Consumer credit increased by \u00a3600m in July, up from \u00a3400m in June. The bulk of the increase was in \"other loans and advances\", which includes overdrafts and personal loans. These were up \u00a3500m, compared with an average monthly increase over the previous six months of \u00a3200m. The Bank's monthly series shows a sharp turnaround earlier this year, from repayments, to a growing pace of lending growth \u2014 though 3.5% remains weak by historical standards. Consumers may be responding to signs that the economy is picking up, and reassurance from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, that interest rates will remain at 0.5% for up to three years. At his first major speech earlier this week, the new governor said he would keep a close eye on the risks of a housing or credit bubble. Business lending also staged a small rise, of \u00a3500m, in July, according to the Bank's data, although small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are still failing to benefit, despite the government's Funding for Lending Scheme, which is partly aimed at channelling lower-cost borrowing to smaller firms. Lending to SMEs fell, by \u00a3900m, in July, and total lending to businesses was 3.3% lower than the same month a year earlier.",

The bulk of the increase was in \"other loans and advances\", which includes overdrafts and personal loans. These were up \u00a3500m, compared with an average monthly increase over the previous six months of \u00a3200m.</p> <p>The Bank's monthly series shows a sharp turnaround earlier this year, from repayments, to a growing pace of lending growth \u2014 though 3.5% remains weak by historical standards.</p> <p>Consumers may be responding to signs that the economy is picking up, and reassurance from the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, that interest rates will remain at 0.5% for up to three years.</p> <p>At <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/28/bank-of-england-governor-interest-rates-low\" title=\"\">his first major speech earlier this week</a>, the new governor said he would keep a close eye on the risks of a housing or credit bubble.</p> <p>Business lending also staged a small rise, of \u00a3500m, in July, according to the Bank's data, although small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are still failing to benefit, despite the government's Funding for Lending Scheme, which is partly aimed at channelling lower-cost borrowing to smaller firms. Lending to SMEs fell, by \u00a3900m, in July, and total lending to businesses was 3.3% lower than the same month a year earlier.</p>",
