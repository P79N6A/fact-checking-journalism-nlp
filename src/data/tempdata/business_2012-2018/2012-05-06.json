      "bodyText": "Reforming the banking sector is expected to be a key theme of chancellor George Osborne's Mansion House speech next month as the government reaffirms its intention to force banks to erect ring fences around their high street operations. Osborne is likely to publish the long-awaited white paper on the Independent Commission on Banking's (ICB) proposals on the same day \u2013 14 June \u2013 in a battle against time to fulfil his promise to legislate for the proposed overhaul during this parliament. The white paper, is expected to be signalled in the Queen's speech on Wednesday when she sets out the government's legislative agenda for the current sitting of parliament. At last year's Lord Mayor's dinner at the Mansion House in the City of London, Osborne had talked about the \"British dilemma\" \u2013 a banking sector that was so large that it could put the economy at risk \u2013 and endorsed the proposals by the ICB, chaired by Sir John Vickers, for a ring fence around high street banks. While the white paper is likely to outline the intricacies of how wide and how high the ring fence around high street operations needs to be, it may also push ahead with a controversial reform known as \"depositor preference\". Banks have campaigned against this plan which puts savers first if a bank becomes insolvent. Banks are also expected to be forced to make it easier for customers to shift their accounts in an effort to bolster competition on the high street. Draft legislation is now likely in the autumn. Osborne has previously said he will get legislation through by the end of this parliament but give banks until 2019 to implement some of the more substantial plans.

      "bodyText": "Politicians have called for care home owners to face a fit and proper persons test and submit their business plans for scrutiny to avoid a second Southern Cross-style collapse. It comes as private equity baron Guy Hands prepares to become the owner of the biggest care homes provider in the country, with responsibility for 25,000 elderly residents. The \u00a3820m purchase of Four Seasons Healthcare by Hands' Terra Firma will see the care home group's debt cut from \u00a3780m to \u00a3525m, but there are concerns Hands will deploy sale and leaseback tactics which he has used in the past. Labour MP John Spellar said: \"The problem with private equity firms is, unlike pension funds, they are usually not in it for the long haul. They want to be in, make a quick profit, and get out. That's what bedevilled Southern Cross with a business model that was fatally flawed. I'd be very concerned if we ended with a similar business model with Four Seasons. \"If Terra Firma and Guy Hands can give evidence that they are in this for the long haul and demonstrate their business plan is up to scrutiny, then that would be great.\" Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston said a review of care home regulation was desperately needed. \"I'd support a fit and proper persons test for care home ownership. I think that's only right because you can't have somebody with a poor track record involved. \"Guy Hands needs to set out exactly how he is going to go about explaining how the homes are going to be run as soon as possible.\" After Terra Firma announced it had bought Four Seasons, Hands said he intended to commit further investment to achieve long-term sustainable growth. Hands said: \"Our number one priority is to ensure that Four Seasons delivers consistent high-quality care and peace of mind for residents, service users and their families.\" He made no comment about possible sale and leaseback proposals but sources close to Terra Firma insist there are no plans to sell the properties. The government has been criticised for failing to bring in safeguards after Southern Cross collapsed last year under a huge debt pile, after private equity investors sold off the care homes in a sale and leaseback scheme. It left the company with unsustainable rent increases, contributing to its collapse in June last year. Former owners, Blackstone, were heavily criticised at the time after bosses pocketed \u00a3600m after floating the company in 2007 with the flawed business plan still in place. The US-based private equity firm was keen to stress it did not set up the sale and leaseback scheme, but did use it as a selling point in its flotation documents. Labour MP John Healey, who was shadow health minister when Southern Cross went bust, warned: \"The government has failed to act on the lessons of the Southern Cross collapse and I think there is a strong case for regulating for good care standards and good business standards. \"I think there's certainly a case for a fit and proper persons test.\" He added: \"Care for some of the most vulnerable in our society was traded by predatory fund managers who saw elderly people as commodities.\" Conservative MP Stephen Dorrell, who chairs the health select committee, said he was open to the idea of a fit and proper person test. The government has promised a white paper on care homes, including regulation reform, in the spring. Dorrell added: \"I work with private equity and I'm not hostile to it. But the key thing is the regulators of care provision need to ensure there are proper safeguards in place. \"The issue of carehome ownership is clearly not going to go away and the Care Quality Commission will be back in front of us [the committee] in September and I'll be surprised if this issue does not come up again.\" Hands has used the sale and leaseback tactic in the past, most notably in 1996 when he was part of the team that bought and then leased back thousands of Ministry of Defence homes through vehicle Annington Homes.",

      "bodyText": "The worst of the recession is over. Unemployment is high but heading in the right direction. The president can boast that he has taken decisive action on a foreign field to defeat the US's enemy. Yet still he lost, for this is not Barack Obama in six months' time but George HW Bush in 1992. Obama's team know their history and they can read the opinion polls. These suggest that the race for the White House will be a close-run thing and that a stuttering economy between now and November could see Obama leave Washington as the first one-term president since Bush Snr. The case for Obama, who kicked off his re-election campaign in Ohio last weekend, is the one succinctly put by the vice-president: Osama bin Laden is dead; General Motors is alive. The administration can boast success on two fronts: eliminating public enemy number one while at the same time intervening to ensure that the Great Recession of the past five years has been less severe in the US than in Europe. That's not saying all that much, however. As the International Monetary Fund has noted, housing busts that result from an excessive build-up in personal debt tend to be long and painful. Governments can help to ease the pain but there are no quick fixes. Falling house prices mean household wealth shrinks, and rising unemployment makes it harder to keep up mortgage payments. Consumer confidence falls and spending dries up. The US over the past decade fits this pattern perfectly. In the bubble phase, low interest rates resulted in both a house-buying spree and a residential construction boom. In the past five years, house prices fell by a third, the number of foreclosures rose fivefold and unemployment peaked at 10% of the workforce. More detailed work at a local level showed that those counties that saw the biggest increase in household debt between 2002 and 2006 saw the biggest drop in consumption once the crisis began. US policymakers have pulled every available lever in an attempt to get the economy moving. As in the UK, the central bank has slashed interest rates and cranked up the electronic printing presses. The White House did its bit with a fiscal stimulus package, and \u2013 in a move that draws admiring glances from the Labour party in Britain \u2013 has delayed taking decisive action to tackle a rising budget deficit. A study conducted by the Fitch ratings agency and Oxford Economics has estimated that the stimulus package boosted US GDP by 4% of national output over the past two years. This, the report says, has prevented the recession in the US from being deeper and longer but raises doubts about the sustainability of the recovery. The point of the pump-priming is that the state acts as a substitute for consumers unwilling to spend and businesses unwilling to invest until such time as private confidence returns. In the US, as elsewhere in the developed world, this is taking a long time, although the IMF says that historically this tends to be the case. Obama's strategy has come under fire from both left and right. The leftwing argument is that the stimulus has failed to provide the necessary boost because it was not big enough. The president paid too much heed to advisers such as Larry Summers when he should have listened to Paul Krugman. A bigger fiscal boost would have meant faster growth, a more rapid decline in unemployment and a rosier outlook both for the president's re-election chances and the public finances. Not so, say Obama's critics on the right. What the president has done is throw good money after bad, borrowing money he doesn't have to fund an expansion of inefficient government. The public have become so alarmed at the explosion in the national debt that they fear taxes will have to rise and this is stopping them spending. The answer is to shrink the size of the state, which will allow taxes to be cut. There are many in the US who believe one or other of these stories. Obama's problem is that few Americans seem to be convinced by his narrative, which is that things have improved a bit since his inauguration in 2009 and will carry on improving if he gets a second term. \"It could have been worse\" is not exactly the most exciting of campaign slogans. It is certainly less gripping than \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\", which is the one Americans will hear from Mitt Romney. Obama has made falling unemployment the key benchmark of his performance, but this may prove unwise. For one thing, unemployment is coming down only very gradually and could start to rise again between now and the election, either because the economy stalls or because the improved chance of finding a job encourages people back into the labour market. A second potential weak spot is that, with the exception of those at the top, real incomes have been squeezed hard over the past four years. Obama has done next to nothing to ensure that ordinary Americans share in the growth of the economy, with work by John Schmitt at the Centre for Economic Policy Research showing that the minimum wage would today be $21.72 an hour if it had been raised in line with productivity since 1968. Its actual rate is $7.25 an hour. So while Obama and his team will no doubt scoff at the idea that a man who made his money out of private equity should be expressing concern at the living standards of blue-collar America, Romney's \"are you better off now\" question still has the potential to damage Obama. So here's how things stand. Most studies suggest that the performance of the US economy under Obama has been pretty much par for the course. A study of 24 major housing busts in rich developed countries carried out by Goldman Sachs found that they tended to have a more sluggish than usual recovery in growth, exhibit persistently high levels of unemployment, and be prone to relapses. The countries examined also had a long period in which the private sector gradually reduced its indebtedness, with this process matched by a sharp deterioration in the public finances. This describes the US today, even down to the unusually low levels of bond yields for an extended period. It would, therefore, be unwise of Democrats to imagine that a rapidly improving economy will make Obama a shoo-in come November. Recovery will remain tepid at best, with Europe and oil prices representing sizeable downside risks. Any signs of the economy faltering will be exploited by Romney, who will tack to the centre now the Republican nomination is in the bag in the hope that he can exploit the strong anti-incumbency political tide evident around the world since the start of the financial crisis.",
