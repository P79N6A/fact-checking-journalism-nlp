      "bodyText": "The Piper Alpha disaster which killed 167 workers on 6 July 1988 off the coast of Aberdeen is the world'sdeadliest ever oil rig accident. The controversy around it was heightened when a report into the disaster by Lord Cullen judged that the operator Occidental Petroleum had used inadequate maintenance and safety procedures. He made more than 100 recommendations about how safety should be improved in the North Sea. Along with other oil companies, Occidental had massively scaled back spending as the price of oil had plunged from more than $30 per barrel to $8 in the 1980s compared to today's level of more than $100. Piper Alpha was once Britain's biggest single oil and gas producing platform, bringing more than 300,000 barrels of crude a day \u2013 10% of the country's total \u2013 from below the seabed 125 miles north-east of Aberdeen. It was owned by a consortium of foreign companies including Texaco and operated by Los Angeles-based Occidental, which sold off its UK interests soon after the disaster to concentrate on the US and Middle East. Oil was discovered at the Piper field in 1973 and was brought on stream three years later. By 1980 the steel platform was modified to also take gas and was connected by pipeline to the Orkney Islands. The original modules on the structure were carefully located, with the staff quarters kept well away from the most dangerous production parts of the platform. But this safety feature was diluted when the gas compression units were installed next to the central control room. Further dangers arose when Occidental decided to keep the platform producing oil and gas as it set about a series of construction, maintenance and upgrade works. A lack of communication at a shift change meant staff were not aware that they should not use a key piece of pipework which had been sealed with a temporary cover and no safety valve. Gas leaked out and ignited while firewalls that would have resisted fire on an oil platform failed to cope with the ensuing gas explosion. When the platform blew 167 out of 228 workers either on the rig or one of the safety standby vessels patrolling it died. The platform was completely destroyed and it took almost three weeks for the fire to be brought under control by famed American wild well controller, Red Adair.

There's a good video here from WSJ Live, in which Dow Jones's Katie Martin explains today's central bank action: Time to wrap up. Here's a very brisk reminder of the main events, after a fast-moving afternoon dominated by unexpected action by the central bankers. \u2022 European stock markets have surged, and the euro and pound have fallen, after the UK and European central banks both moved to counter speculation that monetary policy will be tightened. The FTSE 100 surged 3%, its biggest rise in over 18 months, as traders anticipated a longer period of ultra-loose monetary policy. See 5.14pm and 3.35pm for details and reaction. \u2022 The Bank of England started the rally by issuing a surprise statement at noon today (full text at 12.06pm) In another sign of a change of approach under new governor Mark Carney, the BoE released comments in which it stated that the financial markets had got carried away with their UK interest rate rises (in 2015, the FT calculated). See 12.00pm onwards for details and reaction. \u2022 The European Central Bank then added to the drama, by issuing 'forward guidance' on interest rates for the first time in its history. In what Mario Draghi called an 'unprecedented move', the ECB said rates would probably remain at their current low levels, or be cut again, for an 'extended period'. Although this wasn't wildly different from existing market expectations, the move was seen as a more dovish touch from Draghi and the Frankfurt-based ECB. (see 1.35pm for highlights of the press conference). \u2022 In the eurozone crisis, Greece continued to negotiate with the Troika (IMF, EU, ECB) over its (non?) compliance with the terms of its bailout programme. Talks continue to focus on plans to lay off thousands of civil servants, and park many more in a labour pool on lower wages. Speaking this afternoon, finance minister Yannis Stournaras said he hoped to get a deal by Monday: Talks will continue tonight, tomorrow, the day after and on Sunday...We are heading for agreement on Monday. More from Athens at 4.18pm. \u2022 While in Portugal, there is speculation that a deal to shore up its coalition government is close. Prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho met with junior partner Paulo Portas -- and there are rumours that Portas might 'unresign' and become economy minister. A breakthrough could come this evening... (or might not). See 1.22pm for more. I'll be back tomorrow, when the financial markets will be gripped by the excitement of the latest US unemployment data \u2013 and what it means for the Fed's stimulus plans. Until then, thanks and goodnight. GW Over in Greece, the panel investigating the so-called Lagarde list of suspected tax evaders \u2013 which disappeared after being handed over to Athens \u2013 has recommended that charges are brought against former finance minister Giorgos Papaconstantinou (our Athens correspondent Helena Smith flags up). There's a bit more detail here Here's a few comment pieces and research notes on today's central bank action that caught my eye. In the FT, Gavyn Davies explains that the central banks have embraced forward guidance after interest rates fell to such record low levels, meaning they couldn't communicate policy through rate cuts. He concludes: First, any exit from extraordinary accommodation by the Fed is not likely to be followed by other central banks, which are more likely actually to ease in response to any global effects from the Fed. Markets have already responded to this, and the message for the dollar seems clear. Second, at the BoE, Mark Carney is probably looking for a significant regime change, not just a \u201csteady as she goes\u201d opening to his term of office, and he must be getting some encouragement from other MPC members in making this change. Third, the bias towards easier policy at the ECB is greater than many expected, but the weapons available to them are not all that convincing. More here: We are all forward guiders now Frederik Ducrozet of Credit Agricole also draws three conclusions from the ECB's press conference today, in a new research note: \u2022 In an unprecedented move by ECB standards, Mario Draghi gave more explicit guidance about the future path of policy rates, which will remain at low levels \u201cfor an extended period of time\u201d. This decision on forward guidance was unanimous, adding to the credibility and market impact of the announcement. \u2022 Effective action cannot be ruled out in the future, including a further cut in policy rates or liquidity-easing measures, depending on the macro-financial outlook. However, communication will now de facto become the ECB\u2019s main policy tool. \u2022 The bullish, periphery-friendly response by the market is unlikely to be a flash in the pan, with Draghi and the ECB back to \"whatever it takes\" form, risk perceptions for duration and credit should be adjusted downward Here's the full note: ECB: Whatever It Says (pdf) And the BBC has published a handy explainer on forward guidance: Q&amp;A: What is 'forward guidance'? Fuelled by dovish central banks, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has closed over 3% higher, up a hefty 191 points at 6421. That's its biggest percentage rise since November 2011, and the biggest points jump in nearly two years. Traders clearly welcomed the prospect of interest rates remaining at their current record low levels for a while yet. The surge added more than \u00a348bn to the value of Britain's biggest companies (and the various international firms that also make up the Footsie). That's almost exactly as much as was lost two weeks ago, after the Federal Reserve started talking about stopping its stimulus package by next summer. The other European markets finished at least 2% higher, with the FTSE MIB soaring by 3.4%. And the pound is still down heavily against the US dollar, having lost 2 cents to $1.5070. Brenda Kelly, senior market strategist at IG Index said the equity markets had enjoyed \"a free lunch\" today: Little was expected from either the European Central Bank or Bank of England today, yet much was delivered. While both interest rates remained unchanged, the central banks appeared to be at pains to appease investors\u2019 fears that tighter monetary policy was imminent. While we cannot suggest that this was a co-ordinated move from both central banks, there is a certain tendency to assume that this unprecedented rhetoric could be an attempt to temper the recent hawkish tones emanating from the US Federal Reserve. See 3.35pm for more markets reaction. The European Central Bank's new flirtation with forward guidance isn't enough for the International Monetary Fund. The IMF declared this afternoon that the ECB should make large amounts of liquidity available to eurozone banks, on top of its existing schemes, to drive a recovery. It also wants the eurozone central bank to provide more help to small firms. The advice came as the IMF cut its economic forecasts for Italy. It now expects a 1.8% contraction this year, down from 1.5% previously. The iMF urged Italy to make more structural reforms, raise inheritance tax and combat tax evasion more effectively, adding: Italy\u2019s efforts should be complemented at the euro area level with steps to strengthen the currency union and support growth. Direct asset purchases by the ECB, such as for SME credits, another LTRO of considerable tenor, and lower haircuts on eligible collateral would help lower bank funding costs and lending rates. Greece claims to be getting closer to a deal with the Troika over its \u20ac8bn bailout payment, but the deadlock is likely to last until the weekend, at least...... While the Bank of England and the ECB were stealing the headlines, the Greek government continued to hold talks with top officials from the IMF, the ECB and the EC. Finance minister Yannis Stournaras emerged from the prime minister's office this afternoon to tell the press that progress was being made. However, the two sides remain divided over issues such as the layoff of thousands of civil servants, so its \u20ac8bn aid tranche remains up in the air. Stournaras revealed that talks will continue on Sunday, ahead of Monday's meeting of eurozone finance ministers. Administrative reform minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, responsible for overhauling the public sector, met the Troika this morning. Afterwards, he told reporters that the talks were \"tough\" and would continue on Friday. Across Europe shares are soaring, government debt is rallying, and the pound and euro have fallen sharply after the Bank of England, and the European Central Bank, stunned the financial markets with new, more dovish predictions on interest rates and monetary stimulus measures. In London the FTSE 100 has surged by 3%, gaining 187 points to 6417, with other European markets posting big gains too. In the currency markets, the pound has shed two cents against the US dollar to a low of $1.508, the lowest level since May. The selloff began after the Bank of England, in a surprise move, released a statement after today's rate-setting meeting in which it warned that the financial markets had got carried away by pushing up UK borrowing costs. The statement, released after governor Mark Carney's first MPC meeting, was seen as a signal that UK monetary policy will remain loose for some time. (see 12.00 onwards for the statement, and reaction). Robert Wood of Berenberg Bank explained that the \"persuasive Canadian\" was already moving the Bank of England into new territory: Carney appears to be doing a good job of convincing his colleagues of the need for clear guidance to the markets and the public in order to keep market rate expectations in check and cement the recovery. The Euro shed a cent against the US dollar to $1.291, after the ECB took the \"unprecented\" move to issue forward guidance, and declare that eurozone interest rates will remain at their record lows, or be cut, for \"an extended period\" (full coverage of the ECB's press conference from 1.35pm) Kit Juckes of Soc Gen commented: The Q&amp;A saw an interminable discussion of what extended means but we'll call it 'a good bit longer than a year' and 18 months seems a fair bet. There is a much better than even chance of another rate cut before we are done. Such predictions helped to drive shares higher across Europe, with the German DAX and French CAC both up over 2%, and Spain's IBEX up 3%. And borrowing costs have fallen for governments across Europe, with British 10-year gilt yields dropping to 2.38%. Here's more reaction to the theme of the day, forward guidance on monetary policy. Scott Corfe of CEBR says Mark Carney could help the UK economy if he went further in August and promised low rates for a long time, as Mario Draghi appeared to today. If policymakers can credibly convince businesses that interest rates will remain at rock bottom levels for several more years, they may become more willing to make investment plans. Households may also be more willing to part with their cash if they are assured that mortgage interest payments won\u2019t rise sharply anytime soon. By removing one element of economic uncertainty, Carney may be able to put the UK economy on firmer ground. On the other hand, Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities reckons Mario Draghi pulled off a \"bravura performance in blag and bluff\": Let us give Draghi some very respectful credit on the rhetoric front: he has today been \"selling the dummy\" of 'forward guidance' as near revolutionary for the ECB, given the previous mantra of \"we not not pre-commit\" ... but were markets really thinking ECB rates might rise in the next 12 months, which is all that he has excluded? Aurelija Augulyte of Nordea Markets warns that central bankers must be cautious: While financial journalist Todd Buell takes an alternative view: The key point from Mario Draghi's press conference (from 1.35pm) is that Europe's central bank is prepared to do more to stimulate the struggling eurozone economy, and it wants everyone to know it. By embracing forward guidance, and predicting that rates will stay low or get lower for some time, the ECB has shown a new, more dovish side. Draghi denies that he's been bounced into action by the US Fed's plans to bring its bond-buying plan to a halt. He also insists he's not acting in concert with new boy Mark Carney at the Bank of England (see its own statement at 12.06pm). But it's clear that we're in a new phase of monetary policy, terms of how it's communicated. At the same time, though, the current age of ultra-low interest rates and stimulus measures isn't over yet.... Draghi defends his precious OMT programme, as the anniversary of his pledge to do \"whatever it takes, within the ECB's mandate\" to preserve the euro approaches. He denies that he took the pressure off eurozone governments to reform. Those who think governments were given an excuse not to act are \"heroes of the counterfactual\", he argues. Nice phrase... And finally, Draghi says that \"we all agree\" that low levels of interest rates can pose risks to financial stability. However, the ECB does not see such risks at this time. And that's the end of the press conference.... Asked about Portugal (where the government's future remains in doubt - see 1.22pm), Mario Draghi says the Lisbon government has achieved \"very remarkable results...if not outstanding\".He also pays tribute to Vitor Gaspar, who just resigned as finance minister this week, and also his successor, Maria Luis de Albuquerque. The ECB is \"reassured\" by her appointment, he says, having worked with her at various meeting. From this point of view, Portugal is in safe hands. Honestly, Mario. Asked once again by the Financial Times's Michael Steen about the legal framework for the ECB's bond-buying programme (OMT), Draghi says it is still being worked on and will be published when a country asks for OMT help. No point publishing the terms of the scheme earlier, Draghi smiles...... Draghi continues to deny that the European Central Bank has been bounced into giving forward guidance by the Federal Reserve's talk of slowing its stimulus package this year. However, he also talks about the ECB having to react to instability elsewhere in the world -- and a key factor there is the Fed's plans for tapering.... The Brussels press pack is terribly excited by Mario Draghi's unprecented forward guidance today, that the ECB will keep interest rates at their current, or lower, levels, for an extended period. Is this a change of policy, after 10 years of refusing to precommit? Draghi admits that it is, saying that the ECB now wants to give a \"downward bias\" to interest rates. But what about inflation? Draghi replies: Our priority is to maintain price stability -- price stability goes in both directions Draghi won't give any views on Greece's current negotiations with the Troika, but points out that Greece has made \"significant progress\" since its bailout started. We should achnowledge that, he says. Draghi also says the ECB had \"an extensive discussion about a possible interest rate cut\": How long is an extended period of time? Draghi won't say, but he says the ECB is watching a range of economic indicators when setting interest rates. The ECB has an open mind on many issues, including possibly cutting its deposit rate (on bank deposits) into negative territory. Here's a link to Draghi's statement: Draghi is asked about the report last week about Italy facing heavy losses over derivatives contracts taken out before it entered the euro, and when the ECB governor was in charge of the Italian Treasury. Draghi issues a full-throated defence -- insisting that the contracts (which the FT claims have run up a \u20ac8bn loss) were fully legal, and in line with official regulations. They've been fully checked, he insists. These derivative contracts were only taken out to protect Italy from losses in the foreign exchange markets.... \"This is the only reason they are made\". Transparancy and accountability are vital, he added. First question: will the ECB join the Bank of England in issuing forward guidance? Draghi accuses his questioner of not paying attention, and points to his comments about the governing council expecting all its interest rates to remain at current of low levels. It's an \"unprecented step\" Draghi said.. \"It's the first time that the governing council has said [this]\". It's also a coincidence that this happens on the same day as the Bank of England showing its own dovish plumage, Draghi smiles. (of course, this is the first time either central bank has met officially since the Federal Reserve's comments on slowing its QE programme, last month). In answer to a second question, Draghi reveals that today's decisions were all unanimous. Draghi is also warning that the eurozone suffers from weak loan dynamics, due to the weak state of the business cycle, credit risks and balance sheet adjustment. The euro has fallen sharply as soon as Mario Draghi gave his forward guidance, and is down almost 1 cent against the US dollar today. An early shock from Mario Draghi -- he tells his press conference that the ECB expects to maintain interest rates at their current or lower levels for an extended period of time. That's forward guidance in anyone's book -- just 90 minutes after the Bank of England's own surprise statement. Draghi adds that the ECB will keep an accomodative monetary policy stance for as long as necessary. Risks to economic growth are to the downside, he says Draghi says that confidence indicators in the eurozone show a recovery, from 'low levels'. The European Central Bank press conference is underway. Mario Draghi's reading out his statement (it'll be online soon). He's explaining that the ECB still expects an economic recovery to begin later this year, and continue through 2014. Local media in Portugal are reporting that a deal may be emerging between prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho, and junior coalition partner Paulo Portas. But speculation of a \"new compromise\" with the Troika is hitting Portugal's debt..... The two men held their second meeting in as many days today, following Portas's shock resignation as foreign minister on Tuesday night. According to one report, Portas might return to the government in the role of Deputy PM and economy minister. That would give him, and his party, more influence over Portugal's economic policies. There are also reports that the Lisbon government might seek some concessions from its lenders, in an attempt to ease the burden of its austerity package. Open Europe's Vincenzo Scarpetta flags up the details: And those reports are causing concern in the financial markets, and hitting Portuguese debt again. Having strengthened in early trading, Portugal's 10-year bonds are dropping in value again, pushing up their yield to as high as 7.6% (Tradeweb data). The real ECB drama starts in 45 minutes, at Mario Draghi's press conference. Cue a dash for sandwiches across the City (for those who can leave their desks...) No drama from the ECB, yet.... It has voted to leave interest unchanged, which means the headline cost of borrowing remains at the record low of 0.5%. The ECB also left its deposit rate (what it pays banks to leave money with it) unchanged at 0.0% -- so no negative rates yet. And the marginal rate, which it charges banks when they borrow from it, sticks at 1%. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says today's Bank of England statement shows ite monetary policy committee is moving towards a policy of providing more communications about its decisions: With gilt yields having recently been sent significantly higher amid increased global financial market turmoil, the MPC likely felt it was a good move to make it clear at an early stage that any tightening in UK monetary policy is a considerable was off. RBC Capital Markets agrees that the statement is an early move towards giving 'forward guidance' of the Bank's future intentions, adding: The fact that the MPC has decided to express such a clear view about market rates is also a sign of a more aggressive stance in terms of communication. We think forward guidance will be introduced in August.. the MPC under Mark Carney is likely to focus more on communication, restraining the rise in the expected path for future policy rates but with less emphasis on gilt purchases. This, of course, will not be the only policy initiative from the Bank: over the coming months, we expect to see further measures to ease credit conditions, particularly for the SME sector. The Bank of England's dovish comments on inflation and interest rates sparked a robust exchange of views from two former policymakers, David Blanchflower and Andrew Sentance: There are two key phrases in the Bank of England's surprise statement (see 12.06pm) 1) The first is that \"the implied rise in the expected future path of Bank Rate was not warranted by the recent developments in the domestic economy\". Broadly translated, that means bond yields have risen too high in recent weeks. From 1.6% at the start of May, the yield on Britain's 10-year debt hit 2.5% and the end of June. That was driven by fears in the financial markets that the US is about to slow its stimulus programme. 2) \"Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 2.7% in May and is set to rise further in the near term. Further out, inflation should fall back towards the 2% target...\" That suggests the MPC isn't considering tightening monetary policy to control the rising cost of living. So, no chance of an early interest rate rise, or an end to quantitative easing. That's why the pound's falling, as traders pile into gilts and shares. The days of loose monetary policy in the UK aren't over.... Shares are rallying in London, though -- with the FTSE 100 up 114 points, or 1.8%, at 6344. UK government debt, or gilts, are also rallying. That has pushed down the yield on Britain's 10-year debt to 2.35%, from around 2.4% before the Bank of England's statement. The pound has tumbled by more than a cent against the US dollar after the Bank of England took the rate step of issuing a statement. From $1.526 before the statement was released, the pound has now dropped $1.5117. Here's the offficial text of the statement released by the Bank of England at noon, alongside its decision on rates on QE. Since the May Inflation Report, market interest rates have risen sharply internationally and asset prices have been volatile. In the United Kingdom, there have been further signs that a recovery is in train, although it remains weak by historical standards and a degree of slack is expected to persist for some time. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose to 2.7% in May and is set to rise further in the near term. Further out, inflation should fall back towards the 2% target as external price pressures fade and a revival in productivity growth curbs domestic cost pressures. At its meeting today, the Committee noted that the incoming data over the past couple of months had been broadly consistent with the central outlook for output growth and inflation contained in the May Report. The significant upward movement in market interest rates would, however, weigh on that outlook; in the Committee\u2019s view, the implied rise in the expected future path of Bank Rate was not warranted by the recent developments in the domestic economy. The latest remit letter to the MPC from the Chancellor had requested that the Committee provide an assessment, alongside its August Inflation Report, of the case for adopting some form of forward guidance, including the possible use of intermediate thresholds. This analysis would have an important bearing on the Committee\u2019s policy discussions in August. In the light of these considerations, the Committee voted to maintain the size of its programme of asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank reserves at \u00a3375 billion. The Committee also voted to maintain Bank Rate at 0.5%. The minutes of the meeting will be published at 9.30am on Wednesday 17 July. [end] The Bank of England's monetary policy committee has voted to leave UK interest rates at the current record low of 0.5%, and also left its quantitative easing programme unchanged. And there's a statement,..... Twenty minutes to go until the central bank fun begins, starting with the Bank of England's decision on monetary policy. City economists are broadly united in expecting no change in interest rates, or in Britain's quantitative easing programme (the BoE has already spent \u00a3375bn buying up government debt). City brokerage Abshire-Smith explains: Interest rates are expected to be left unchanged at the record low of 0.50%, with asset purchases (QE) to be held steady at \u00a3375bn. However if the expected happens (both left unchanged) it should leave traders slightly disappointed with Carney\u2019s first week in office being an anti-climax. There's always the (small?) possibility of a statement from the Monetary Policy Committee. After such a quiet morning, the City is hoping for more action. Developments in Greece (finally) -- administrative reform minister Kyriakos Mitsotak has concluded today's meeting with Troika officials over the vexed issue of civil service layoffs. Mitsotak is now discussing the situation with prime minister Antonis Samaras - who is due to sit down with the Troika himself soon. It's a busy day for Samaras. He's already held talks with German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle this morning: Yesterday, Westerwelle ruled out another debt writedown for Greece, and suggested that the country's prospects were finally improving: My impression is that we for the first time are seeing a faint silver lining on the horizon. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras (on the left) looked pretty serious this morning as he chatted with the government's spokesman, Simos Kedikoglou at prime minister Antonis Stournaras's office: The political disagreements in Portugal didn't prevent Spain or France from selling debt this morning, although the cost of borrowing did rise slightly. The Spanish treasury sold three-year bonds at an average yield of 2.875%, up from 2.706%, as it raised a total of \u20ac4bn from the markets. France raised \u20ac8bn, but also saw yields inch higher. The Portuguese turmoil may have inflamed eurozone crisis fears, but it has also made other euro area debt look more attractive in comparison, argued Nick Stamenkovic, bond strategist at RIA Capital Markets. He explained: The recent Portuguese-driven correction has enhanced the attractiveness of Spanish bonds and the auction was taken down very well. The outlook in Portugal is very clouded. What's interesting is that Italy and Spain have been relatively resilient. The contagion is very limited and a sign that investors see those problems as very localised and don't see them being a threat to the euro zone. Nikos Dendias, Greece's minister of Public Order and Citizen Protection, has declared that the Greek goevrnment shouldn't be blamed if, as seems likely, it fails to persuade the Troika that bailout targets are being met. Appearing on CNBC, Dendias argued that Greece was doing its best to comply with an imperfect financial programme. saying: The plan is hardly our fault. We're co-responsible in a sense [for Greek debt levels before the bailout] but I'm sure that the European institutions saw a bubble being created in Greece and nobody really warned us about being more careful. I'm not saying we're not at fault, but there are others at fault. I see Europe as a family and as European friends and partners, so it's everybody's fault. But the main question is how we go forward, not to start a blame game\u2026We will do better in the future I am confident about that. More details here Dendias's comment come after finance ministry officials told Reuters yesterday that there was no real chance of meeting the Troika's demands in time for next Monday's eurogroup meeting. That would mean that the next Greek aid payment, worth \u20ac8bn, might not be paid immediately - or only paid in installments. Over in Athens, top officials from the Troika will hold further talks today with administrative reform minister Kyriakos Mitsotak over Greece's bailout programme and planned civil service job cuts. Mitsotak is under pressure to press on with moving 12,500 public servants into a labour mobility scheme, on lower wages and the risk of being fired if new jobs can't be found. Greece is also meant to be cutting 4,000 civil service positions. And local media say the EBC-IMF-EC officials aren't willing to count the staff who are being laid off at state broadcaster ERT. Kathimerini explains: Sources at the Administrative Reform Ministry told Kathimerini on Wednesday that \u201cthe basis for reaching an agreement is in place.\u201d One of the key problems is that the visiting inspectors refuse to recognize the 2,600 sackings at public broadcaster ERT as permanent dismissals. Until they are given detailed plans of how the new broadcaster will operate and how many employees it will take on, the officials will not accept that the government has carried out any firings. So after all the anger and aggrevation over the sudden closure of ERT, it may not help Greece's case with the Troika after all... Another reason for the bounceback on the Portuguese stock market is that Lisbon's financial regulator banned short-selling of four companies, including three banks whose shares all tumbled over 10% yesterday. This prevents traders from selling shares they don't own, with a plan to buy them back cheaper after they've been routed. And this morning, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority followed suit. It has prohibited anyone in the City from shorting Banco Comercial Portugues, Banco Espirito Santo or Sonae Industria. The ban expires at midnight..... Here's their announcement. Optimism abounds on Portugal's stock market - the PSI 20 is now up 3.5% on hopes that the country's leaders can resolve the crisis. Portugal's prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, is reported to have held \"very constructive\" talks last night with his junior coalition partner, Paulo Portas. That's via the Wall Street Journal's Patricia Kowsmann, in Lisbon. A reminder about the political situation -- Passos Coelho's Social Democrats govern in a coalition with Portas's CDS-PP, or Conservative Popular Party. If CDS walk away then Passos Coelho could lose his majority. He could lead a minority government, but would be at risk of losing a confidence vote. Passos Coelho had initially refused to accept Portas's resignation as foreign minister. And last night, CDS said that it didn't expect any oher ministers to also resign. Here's an early assessment of the situation today from Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale: Portuguese political leaders are planning to hold talks to ease the country's political crisis, and even if they can't calm nerves completely, 10yr yields have already dropped back 30 basis points from last night's close. With the US on holiday, the ECB meeting take centre stage. The UK MPC is also meeting. At some point, Mr Carney is going to want to shake things up in terms of post-meeting communication, but this week may be just a bit too soon. Shares are also bouncing back on the Lisbon stock market. After yesterday's 5% tumble, the PSI 20 is up over 2% on hopes that the Portuguese government won't collapse. Every share is up, led by banking stocks, which suffered badly yesterday. Prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho insisted yesterday evening that he could ride out the storm. The news that his junior coalition partner hasn't jumped ship (yet, anyway), is fuelling optimism. And here's the details: \u2022 PSI 20: up 112 points at 5,348, +2.1% \u2022 FTSE 100: up 56 points at 6285, +0.9% \u2022 German DAX: up 72 points at 7901, + 0.9% \u2022 French CAC: up 42 points at 3744, +1.15% \u2022 Spanish IBEX up 51 points at 7807, +0.5% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 103 points at 15376, + 0.68% And here's a graph of Portuguese 10-year bond yields this week, showing the sharp fall this morning back towards safer levels after yesterday's alarm: After an alarming day yesterday, the situation in Portugal appears to be easing. Portuguese government bonds are recovering some value in early trading, after yesterday's sharp selloff. And the European stock markets are bouncing back too. This follows the news last last night that the junior coalition partner (CDS) in the Portuguese government has pledged to play its part in holding the government together. Their party leader had sparked the crisis by dramatically quitting as foreign minister on Tuesday. With the Portuguese president holding talks with party leaders today, there is hope that a deal can be hammered out to hold Pedro Passos Coelho's government together. This has pushed up the value of Portugal's debt, driving down the value (effectively the interest rate) on its 10-year bonds to just 7.24%, from 7.5% last night. That's a sign of traders are less alarmed about the Lisbon situation. Shares are also up across Europe -- details to follow..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone, the financial crisis and the global economy. It's Central Banks day in Europe, with the Bank of England and the European Central Bank's top officials gathering to set monetary policy in Britain and the eurozone. And that means ECB president Mario Draghi facing the press this afternoon, at a time when the eurozone crisis is picking up pace again. The political turmoil that broke out in Portugal this week is another reminder that, for all Draghi's talk of doing 'whatever it takes' to protect the euro, this remains a poitical crisis as well as an economic, financial and social one. Analysts don't expect a cut in eurozone interest rates, but as ever, what Draghi says is almost as interesting as what he actually does. Carsten Brzeski of ING reckons the ECB president will urge the markets to stay calm, and pledge not to tighten monetary policy anytime soon: In our view, the ECB remains in crisis mode. The eurozone economy is still lagging far behind the US economy and exit discussions at a moment in which the economy is showing that signs of a bottoming out are more than premature. Draghi is also bound to field questions over issues such as whether the ECB is close to imposing negative interest rates on banks, and its promises of more support to help small firms borrow. Draghi's views on Greece, where the government continues to meet with the Troika in an attempt to unlock its next \u20ac8bn bailout loans, could also be interesting... At the Bank of England, it's the first time that new governor Mark Carney has voted on UK interest rates and quantitative easing. We're not expecting any fireworks \u2013 recent UK data has been quite upbeat \u2013 but you never know how the new man might shake things up.... I'll be watching both the Bank of England (decision at noon BST) and the European Central Bank (decision at 12.45pm, press conference at 1.30pm), along with the latest developments across the eurozone.",

      "bodyText": "A whistleblower has warned that a system of safety representatives set up to underpin the integrity of oil and gas platforms in the North Sea following the Piper Alpha explosion is being made a \"mockery\" owing to an atmosphere of offshore bullying by some managers. The claims come just before tomorrow's formal 25th anniversary of the rig disaster \u2013 the world's deadliest offshore accident in in which 167 workers died. The whistleblower, who has spent 20 years in the industry, claims some serious injuries continue to be covered up rather than reported while \"lost time accidents\" \u2013 a key industry safety measurement \u2013 can be manipulated by keeping injured employees on board a rig until it is time for their leave. \"Under Health and Safety Executive regulations a company is duty bound to look after workers by way of safety reps and their regular meetings. But it's a mockery. They don't often happen and top line supervisors risk losing bonuses if there are too many lost time incidents, so (injured) people are kept on board so they don't have to report it,\" said the offshore worker, who asked not to be named. The whistleblower says there are many North Sea safety reps who never attend any safety sessions despite the HSE regulations calling for each group of workers to hold discussions every three months. The offshore worker, whose identity is verified by the RMT union in Aberdeen, also said one of his colleagues had been re-elected as a safety rep by the workforce but his appointment had been overruled by the employer. Jake Molloy, an Aberdeen-based organiser of the RMT, supports the claims made by the whistleblower, and estimates that the safety rep structure and industrial relations, in general, are either \"poor or completely dysfunctional\" on 40% of North Sea rigs or platforms. He believes lost time injury statistics are \"meaningless\" and said BP's Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 showed the dangers of what happens when workers feel unable to challenge and halt drilling in dangerous situations. \"You can have the most technologically advanced rig on the planet like the Deepwater Horizon but it's now lying on the bottom of the sea with 11 dead \u2026 the danger of another Macondo is always real, especially on high-pressure wells in deep water off the (UK) west coast,\" he said. Last month the HSE said the number of large gas and oil leaks from the UK's offshore installations rose in 2012 from three to nine, the highest in 14 years. Included in those figures was a leak that went on for almost two months on the Elgin platform operated by Total of France. In late 2010 the same safety watchdog sent a report to rig operator, Transocean, in which staff alleged they had been bullied and harassed, something that was denied by the US company. And in 2007 the HSE issued a report following a study showing that almost 60% of North Sea oil platforms had rusting or other problems that oil companies should have addressed. But Oil &amp; Gas UK, the employers' group, issued its latest annual health and safety report two week ago in which it reported a 48% reduction in the number of reportable oil and gas releases over the last three years and an all-time low last year in the incidence of \"over-three day injuries\", which it regards as key measures for good industry performance. Sally Hatch, an Oil &amp; Gas UK spokeswoman, said on Thursday eveningthat it did not recognise the picture painted by the whistleblower of bullying and intimidation. \"We are not aware of that scenario. Industry representatives are represented at the highest level with the RMT sitting on the Step Change in Safety partnership. Safety reps are trained by the oil and gas industry and are given all the tools and knowledge needed to represent their colleagues,\" she said. \"Reporting of offshore lost time injuries is very high. HSE inspectors periodically check first aid treatment records kept on the installation by the offshore medic as part of their planned inspection activities.\" But she confirmed that only 91 of the 2,000 safety reps working across the North Sea had appeared at the Workforce Involvement Day at the Piper Alpha 25 event, which ran for three days and was a key event for discussing industry safety. Frank Doran, whose first stint as an MP for Aberdeen coincided with the accident, said he believed there had been \"huge improvements\" in the general safety culture in the North Sea but he also warned there were still gaps in the system. \"There have been some pretty shocking figures on gas releases and some of contracting companies come under pressure from the big boys (larger groups) but the general trajectory is in the right direction. At the UK (oil and gas industry) safety awards the main speech was given by the general secretary of the Scottish TUC. That would have been unthinkable in the past.\"",

Events in Egypt helped companies with operations there. Gold miner Centamin - which is in dispute with the authorities over the validity of its licence for its Sukari mine - climbed 4.6p to 35.75p. Analyst Maurice Mason at Peel Hunt said: These developments clearly elevate the political uncertainty surrounding Centamin, and at this stage the implications for the ongoing court case is unknown. However, it should be remembered that Centamin's legal troubles started only since the current government was in power and its removal from office could ultimately turn out to be positive. Meanwhile gases group BG, which has operations in the country, rose 32.5p to \u00a311.38. In a note this week, analysts at RBC said concerns about the political risk in Egypt had been overplayed: More than 50% of BG's production in Egypt goes to the domestic market, and in our view, popular discontent increases the importance to the government (Muslim Brotherhood or military) to maintain production. But Schroders fell 19p to \u00a322.36 despite a positive note from JP Morgan Cazenove which said: Following completion of the acquisition of Cazenove Capital we resume coverage of Schroders with an overweight (price target 2281p) recommendation. In our view the company continues to offer a compelling investment despite the strength of share price performance seen in the year to date. We believe that our estimates are conservatively struck with respect to potential new business flows, costs and operating leverage. In our view, Schroders is very strongly positioned to fully exploit the heritage and value of the Cazenove Capital brand. Traders suggested the market was unhappy about its launch of a sterling-hedged share class on two of its European funds. Balfour Beatty was steady at 220.1p as it won a \u00a3200m contract from Herefordshire council for highway maintenance and improvement works, as well as parks and lighting. Earlier in the week the infrastructure group was hit by a sell note from Liberum Capital. Lower down the market department store group Beale lost a quarter of its value, down 3.75p to 11.25p after half year gross profits fell by \u00a32.1m to \u00a318.4m, partly due to poor weather especially during spring. The company abandoned the TV and audio market, and tried to target its promotions more effectively. But it warned the outlook continued to be challenging although it successfully refinanced its balance sheet.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England surprise statement sends markets up and sterling tumbling", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Stock markets roared ahead and sterling tumbled after the Bank of England and European Central Bank took unprecedented steps to quash investor fears that they were preparing to reduce monetary stimulus. Under the chairmanship of new Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, the monetary policy committee issued an unexpected statement to indicate that despite a rise in inflation there was no need for the sharp rise in yields on government bonds, known as gilts. The rise in yields took place in the six weeks since the US Federal Reserve started to discuss reducing economic stimulus, rattling markets amid fears that other central bank would follow. And Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB, said the eurozone's central bank was taking unprecedented steps to give so-called forward guidance to reassure the markets that it had no plans to raise interest rates soon. The ECB, facing a new crisis in Portugal, had even discussed a rate cut, Draghi said. \"The governing council expects the key ECB rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time,\" Draghi told a news conference. The unexpected statement from the MPC \u2013 chaired for the first time by Carney in his first week as Bank of England governor \u2013 pushed the FTSE 100 almost 200 points higher and drove sterling down against the dollar. Gilt yields also fell, after rising more than one percentage point since the start of May when the Fed first started discussing easing monetary policy, after the markets responded to the remarks by the MPC. The MPC's statement is a departure from the stance adopted by Carney's predecessor, Sir Mervyn King, who retired last week and who rarely issued statements immediately after rate-setting meetings. As expected the MPC left interest rates on hold at 0.5% \u2013 the historic low they have been at for more than four years \u2013 and quantitative easing (QE) unchanged at \u00a3375bn. While the decision not to embark on more QE had been expected and follows a string of upbeat data that has reinforced hopes that growth in the UK economy was stronger in the second quarter than the first, when gross domestic product increased by 0.3%. \"At its meeting today, the committee noted that the incoming data over the past couple of months had been broadly consistent with the central outlook for output growth and inflation contained in the May [inflation] report. The significant upward movement in market interest rates would, however, weigh on that outlook; in the committee's view, the implied rise in the expected future path of Bank rate was not warranted by the recent developments in the domestic economy,\" the MPC said. The former MPC member, Andrew Sentance, tweeted: \"Inflation is set to rise, and BoE statement pours cold water on rate rises. Pretty dismal signal from MPC to Britain's savers.\" Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"With gilt yields having recently been sent significantly higher amid increased global financial market turmoil, the MPC likely felt it was a good move to make it clear at an early stage that any tightening in UK monetary policy is a considerable way off.\" Economists said more QE was also a possibility at the August policy meeting, by which point the MPC will have seen the Bank's latest forecasts for growth and inflation before its next quarterly inflation report. Since its last quarterly inflation report in May, the MPC said on Thursday that 12-month CPI inflation \u2013 a measure of consumer prices \u2013 had risen to 2.7% and could rise further before falling back. It also noted that interest rates being priced in by markets had risen sharply and asset prices had been volatile. \"In the United Kingdom, there have been further signs that a recovery is in train, although it remains weak by historical standards and a degree of slack is expected to persist for some time,\" the MPC said. Interest rates have been at an all-time low of 0.5% since March 2009, the same month that the MPC made the unprecedented decision to introduce QE, its asset purchasing programming. James Knightley of ING said: \"This is pretty aggressive stuff that has prompted a sharp move lower in sterling and suggests that Carney is very much in the dovish camp.\" Carney succeeded King as the Bank's governor on 1 July and how he voted at the meeting will not be known until 17 July. But it is now clearer that next month the MPC could start to provide guidance about the potential future path of interest rates, following in the footsteps of the Fed and marking a departure for the Bank. In the statement issued after the first meeting Carney chaired, the MPC said: \"The latest remit letter to the MPC from the chancellor had requested that the committee provide an assessment, alongside its August inflation report, of the case for adopting some form of forward guidance, including the possible use of intermediate thresholds. This analysis would have an important bearing on the committee's policy discussions in August.\" The CBI's director of economics, Stephen Gifford, said: \"Looking ahead, some form of forward guidance on interest rates remains a strong possibility. Although the MPC's scepticism will be hard to dispel, recent financial market volatility and today's statement by the Bank have strengthened the case for providing greater clarity around monetary policy, which businesses would welcome.\"",

The 469-seat Airbus A380, the first to be owned by a UK airline, was signed over in a ceremony at the manufacturer's Toulouse airport base before departing for London. Airbus claims that the giant planes, with an upper deck six feet wider than the Boeing 747s they will replace, will each save the airline \u00a3100m in fuel costs over their lifetimes.

More significantly for those under the flightpath, the A380's \"noise footprint\" on landing at Heathrow \u2013 the area greatly affected by noise disturbance \u2013 is claimed to be a quarter of that of a 747. Heathrow charges lower landing fees to quieter aircraft and is continuing to develop stands and taxiways to accommodate the A380s. Matt Gorman, Heathrow's sustainability director, said the aircraft would contribute to noise reduction and that noise now affected fewer people around the airport than at any time since the 1970s, despite flight numbers having almost doubled.

Mario Draghi, his counterpart in the eurozone, is also capable of a little creative thinking when a market wobble looks like turning into a rout. It took only a few words. But when they were finished, the FTSE 100 was up almost 3% and the cost in the UK of providing a five-year fixed rate mortgage had nudged down six basis points to 1.35%. Why the need for action? Last month Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke illustrated how panicky the markets can be when the cost of borrowing looks like climbing. It was widely considered naive of him to answer a straight question with a straight answer when he bluntly stated that the Fed must, at some point, stop printing extra dollars at the rate of $85bn (\u00a356.2bn) a month. The markets, in essence, took his words to mean that ultra low borrowing costs were coming to an end. It sent the cost of long-term borrowing, as measured by US Treasury bond yields, soaring. There has been much talk in the UK about the recovery being strong enough for the Bank of England to raise rates. Long-term borrowing costs, as measured by the gilts market, have jumped. A couple of months of decent economic figures must mean a return to more \"normal\" rates of interest, goes the argument. Carney knew this debate would gain momentum if Thursday's decision to hold rates and sit on the current \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing went without comment. No matter that his predecessor Sir Mervyn King poured cold water on the idea of a sustained recovery leading to higher interest rates in his parting shot to MPs last week. Markets would presume from the monetary policy committee's stance that a rise in rates was likely sooner rather than later and price the cost of lending money accordingly higher. Now Carney and Draghi have now placed their boots on the neck of this debate and pressed hard. In an act clearly inspired by Carney, the MPC said \"the implied rise in the expected future path of bank rate was not warranted by the recent developments in the domestic economy\". You can't be clearer than that. The MPC is saying the economy is still weak and will need low rates for some time to come. Any thoughts of a rise are premature. Draghi said much the same. We should be sceptical as to whether Carney's mastery of communications can be maintained and how much this game between the central bank and the markets will affect the long-term outcome for the economy. After all the five-year gilt yield, which determines the interest rate, may have fallen six basis points, yet remains 24 basis points higher than a month ago. But Carney is obviously going to give it his best shot.",

      "bodyText": "Budget airlines are constantly on the lookout for ways to cut their fuel bills and India's GoAir is no different. Its latest idea is to hire female-only cabin crew, refusing applications from their heavier male counterparts in a bid to limit fuel burn. The low-cost airline has calculated that the move will save up to 30m rupees (\u00a3330,000) a year, because women 20kg lighter on average. Around 130, or 40%, of GoAir's existing crew members are male, and they will keep their jobs. But men will miss out in the future, as the airline presses ahead with ambitious expansion plans for 80 new aircraft by 2020 and around 2,000 cabin crew and pilots. It currently has a fleet of 15 aircraft. The chief executive, Giorgio De Roni, said the decision was driven by the rupee's sharp fall against the dollar over the past year. \"The rupee's fall has hurt the industry badly. All major expenses \u2013 aircraft leasing, spare parts and fuel costs \u2013 are linked to the dollar,\" he told the Times of India. \"We are looking at every possible way of cost-cutting to remain profitable.\" As operating costs rise, GoAir has taken other measures to reduce the weight on board its aircraft and limit fuel burn. Its in-flight magazines have been shrunk, and water tanks are not being filled to capacity. Aircraft are also using a single engine to taxi in order to save fuel. \"Our new aircraft will have sharklets [wingtip devices] that will help in reducing fuel burn by 5%. From next year onwards, we will have sharklets installed in five of our existing planes, while the remaining 10 will be phased out to have a young fleet,\" De Roni said.",
