      "body": "<p>The chief executive of Vodafone, Vittorio Colao, has called for a \"moratorium on regulation\" in the telecoms industry, warning that unless Europe stops imposing price cuts, mobile companies will slash investment in networks.</p> <p>On the eve of a European vote to cut the cost of using a phone while travelling, Colao told reporters at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona that the move would cost jobs in the wider economy and that lawmakers faced a choice between a \"heaven and hell scenario\".</p> <p>\"Does Europe need employment or does Europe need rate cuts? We should stop having this continuous intervention on prices and let the industry reinvest the money.\"</p> <p>In the last year, operators across Europe have seen revenues fall in line with reductions on the wholesale price of calling a mobile from a landline, so-called mobile termination rates.</p> <p>They are about to pay billions for the spectrum needed to deliver superfast mobile broadband, with the UK's biggest ever auction of airspace expected to conclude early next year. The new 4G technology will require major investment in masts and fibre cables, but Vodafone believes it may not be able to sustain its \u00a36.2bn annual spend.</p> <p>\"Regulators should stop cutting mobile termination rates, pushing down roaming prices, building funny auctions which are designed to extract more money from existing operators, and resisting industry consolidation,\" Colao said. \"This is not a request for a moratorium on competition but a much stronger request for a moratorium on regulation.\"</p> <p>The UK, which will not introduce 4G nationally until the end of 2013, risks slipping further behind other nations in the race to roll out superfast broadband. The United States, Sweden, Germany and Singapore already have 4G networks.</p> <p>\"The reality is, we have a heaven scenario or a hell scenario,\" said Colao. \"The hell scenario is every year we lose hundreds of millions to mobile termination rates and we reduce our investment. Investment means jobs not just in the telecoms sector, but in the media, entertainment and applications developer sectors.\"</p> <p>MEPs are expected to vote on Tuesday on a series of price cuts that will fix the wholesale cost of using a mobile abroad while travelling in the European Union for the next decade. This will take the form of a staggered reduction in voice and internet call costs.</p> <p>Consumer group Which?, mobile operator Three and a number of small business trade groups have argued that the cuts do not go far enough, and will leave customers facing \"bill shock\" when they return from holiday.</p> <p>Last week they wrote to communications minister Ed Vaizey urging him to push for lower prices. Under the current proposals, 1 gigabyte of data (enough to download 200 songs or watch two hours of video) would cost \u00a3400 abroad, when it costs just \u00a310 at home in the UK today.</p> <p>But savings imposed by regulators are not being passed on to customers, said Colao, quoting European Commission research. For every \u20ac10 cut from the wholesale price of calling a mobile from a landline, just \u20ac2 was passed on through lower retail prices. Vodafone argues most of the balance is pocketed by fixed-line operators such as BT Group or Virgin Mobile in the UK. \"People think every time there is a reduction there is more money in the pockets of customers. This is not true.\"</p> <p>Vodafone believes regulation is out of date and needs revising. It would like to see the European Commission and national regulators back away from intrusive rulemaking such as setting prices.</p> <p>The UK telecommunications watchdog Ofcom should still have a role in regulating fixed-line and fibre-optic broadband access, said Colao, but its remit should be limited to \"competition regulation\" where mobile operators are concerned. This would still give it a say on mergers and preventing cartels, for example.</p>",

They are about to pay billions for the spectrum needed to deliver superfast mobile broadband, with the UK's biggest ever auction of airspace expected to conclude early next year. The new 4G technology will require major investment in masts and fibre cables, but Vodafone believes it may not be able to sustain its \u00a36.2bn annual spend. \"Regulators should stop cutting mobile termination rates, pushing down roaming prices, building funny auctions which are designed to extract more money from existing operators, and resisting industry consolidation,\" Colao said. \"This is not a request for a moratorium on competition but a much stronger request for a moratorium on regulation.\" The UK, which will not introduce 4G nationally until the end of 2013, risks slipping further behind other nations in the race to roll out superfast broadband. The United States, Sweden, Germany and Singapore already have 4G networks. \"The reality is, we have a heaven scenario or a hell scenario,\" said Colao. \"The hell scenario is every year we lose hundreds of millions to mobile termination rates and we reduce our investment. Investment means jobs not just in the telecoms sector, but in the media, entertainment and applications developer sectors.\" MEPs are expected to vote on Tuesday on a series of price cuts that will fix the wholesale cost of using a mobile abroad while travelling in the European Union for the next decade. This will take the form of a staggered reduction in voice and internet call costs. Consumer group Which?, mobile operator Three and a number of small business trade groups have argued that the cuts do not go far enough, and will leave customers facing \"bill shock\" when they return from holiday. Last week they wrote to communications minister Ed Vaizey urging him to push for lower prices. Under the current proposals, 1 gigabyte of data (enough to download 200 songs or watch two hours of video) would cost \u00a3400 abroad, when it costs just \u00a310 at home in the UK today. But savings imposed by regulators are not being passed on to customers, said Colao, quoting European Commission research. For every \u20ac10 cut from the wholesale price of calling a mobile from a landline, just \u20ac2 was passed on through lower retail prices. Vodafone argues most of the balance is pocketed by fixed-line operators such as BT Group or Virgin Mobile in the UK. \"People think every time there is a reduction there is more money in the pockets of customers. This is not true.\" Vodafone believes regulation is out of date and needs revising. It would like to see the European Commission and national regulators back away from intrusive rulemaking such as setting prices. The UK telecommunications watchdog Ofcom should still have a role in regulating fixed-line and fibre-optic broadband access, said Colao, but its remit should be limited to \"competition regulation\" where mobile operators are concerned. This would still give it a say on mergers and preventing cartels, for example.",

      "bodyText": "HSBC, the biggest bank in Europe, handed more than \u00a31m to 192 of its top staff in 2011, a year when profits at the bank slipped 6%. As the chairman, Douglas Flint, described overall performance as \"satisfactory in aggregate\", the bank admitted that 64 of the 192 paid more than \u00a31m were based in the UK. The shares were one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100 as even though at first sight the profits were up 15% at $21.9bn (\u00a313.8bn), the market focused on a $17.7bn figure which stripped out $3.9bn of gains on the value of the bank's own debt. Becoming the first major bank to comply with new Treasury requirements to publish the top eight highest paid \"executives\", the bank revealed that these unidentified employees shared \u00a330m between them. Under Hong Kong listing rules the bank also published the details of the five highest paid \"employees\" which produced a total of \u00a327.7m, reflecting how the UK rules on \"executives\" do not always capture the biggest earners. The highest-paid employee earned $12m \u2013 \u00a38.1m. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver \u2013 and other members of his executive team \u2013 had their bonuses docked because of the payment protection insurance scandal and the \u00a310.5m fine by Financial Services Authority for the mis-selling to elderly customers by its NHFA subsidiary. Others had their bonuses \"clawed back\" because of these incidents. Gulliver's bonus might have been \u00a31.3m higher without those mistakes but even so, the bank said he was paid \u00a37.2m in 2011 \u2013 \u00a31.25m salary, \u00a32.16m bonus and \u00a33.75m in a long-term incentive plan, and the second highest paid employee under the Hong Kong listing rules methodology.

Gulliver stressed that his plan to cut costs was a \"redesign of the group, not a shrinkage\" even though he has conceded that 30,000 roles will go in the next three years as he tries to bolster the bank's return on equity to 12-15%. The figure for 2011 was 10.9%. The bonus pool for investment bankers was down to $1.2bn from $1.6bn while the entire bank's bonus pool was $4.2bn, unchanged on the year. Profits in the global investment bank fell 24% to $7bn \u2013 and collapsed in the European investment banking arm to $77m from $2.7bn. The commercial bank made record profits of $8bn.

The average pay to its 320 \"code staff\" \u2013 up from 280 \u2013 was $1.58m down from $1.68m a year ago.

One unidentified employee \u2013 described as \"non-senior management\" \u2013 got a signing-on fee of $3.5m. While Gulliver, who took the helm a year ago, achieved his goals on its dividend policy, he missed targets on other elements of financial performance such as return on equity and improving costs. The cost efficiency ratio worsened to 57.5% from 55.2% and reached 61% on an underlying basis. The crucial measure of capital \u2013 the core tier one ratio \u2013 also deteriorated to 10.1% from 10.5%. Gulliver spelled out how the bank divided up its $16.2bn of attributable profit \u2013 50% for capital, 35% to shareholders through $7.3bn of dividends, and 15% to employees. The Association of British Insurers said this breakdown \"strengthens its [HSBC's] investment case\".

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Is the economy finally looking up? In recent weeks there has been a run of better than expected data \u2013 from export levels to the monthly tax take and high street spending \u2013 that suggests it just might be. And there are economic boosts to come later this year when the Queen celebrates her diamond jubilee and the Olympics arrive in the capital. Is the worst over, or is that just wishful thinking? Economic indicators For a couple of months, surveys of UK businesses have \"surprised on the upside\", as economists say. According to responses from manufacturers and service industry companies, especially IT and telecoms firms, there is money to be made in 2012 and they are not going to miss the opportunity. Export orders are up along with domestic output across all sectors, with the exception of construction. Fears of a double dip recession have receded. Verdict The outlook is improving, but higher unemployment, rising oil prices and public sector spending cuts could yet make things worse. Shopping Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the volume of spending in the high street and online rose by 0.9% in January. The increase \u2013 which meant consecutive rises in December and January for the first time in eight years \u2013 cheered the City, which was expecting a fall after a better than forecast Christmas. Several retailers reported a bounce in sales over the period, with House of Fraser, Sainsbury and Majestic Wine in the lead. Even Dixons held up well. Verdict The British Retail Consortium reported a drop in sales in January, so the picture is mixed. The Christmas rush was fuelled by consumers running up more debt. Can that last? Euro crisis over The deal signed between eurocrats and the Greek coalition government brings to an end two years of hand wringing over how to deal with Athens' debts. UK trade should pick up as the eurozone dusts itself down and gets back to business. Verdict As the joke says, Europe cut a hole in its pocket when Greece joined the euro. Why does anyone think the saga is over when there is so much that can go wrong, from a fractious French election in April to Greece failing to keep its austerity promises? China and the US The US is powering ahead and nothing in an election year can stop it. Congress will not want to rock the boat when it is gliding across choppy waters like a schooner. China has suffered from the euro crisis more than the US and saw export orders crash in January, but economists now believe it will have a soft landing and could start growing strongly again if the Greek deal holds. Verdict It might be storing up long-term problems, but these powerhouses will help the UK recovery. House prices The widely predicted housing crash has not happened. Prices have slipped, especially in the north and west of the country, but in many parts of London and the south east they remain at pre-crash levels and even continue to rise. Mortgage approvals are at a two-year high, a figure backed by Midlands housebuilder Redrow, which says there are plenty of people who want to buy. Verdict One City analyst recently warned of a \"lost decade\" as strict lending rules and a dearth of buyers dampen demand. Steve Morgan, the boss of housebuilder Redrow, begged to differ. The analyst, he said, was talking \"a load of bollocks\". Banks Britain's banks have boosted their reserves and are better able than most in Europe to withstand further shocks. They have stable managements and have almost met the government's demands for lending to small and medium-sized businesses. Lloyds has even told some directors they must give up some of their past bonuses, cheering taxpayers angry at their role in the financial crisis. HSBC and Barclays remain global players. Verdict The price of credit will remain high as banks pass on the cost of rebuilding their balance sheets to customers. Inflation Prices are rising at their slowest pace for a couple of years. Last month the consumer prices index fell to 3.6% from 4.2% in December. Last year it jumped above 5%. Further falls are expected, which should mean that some workers find they receive a real-terms pay increase this year for the first time since 2007. A feelgood factor is needed to spur consumption and investment, and low inflation could provide the necessary boost. Verdict Inflation is likely to remain volatile for many years with the price of oil and other commodities yo-yoing around. Since the financial crash, inflation has surged and fallen back twice. Prepare for more volatility. Productivity After years of low productivity, UK companies are attempting to increase output per unit of labour. Former defence minister Liam Fox said it was the single most important improvement that could be made and laws allowing a hire-and-fire ethos in the UK were necessary for sustained growth because the more a worker produces from the same investment in plant and machinery, the bigger the potential profits. From higher profits should come higher wages. Initially improvements will come from redundancies, but in time companies will rehire staff as existing employees reach their productive capacity. Verdict Works for employers, but if unemployment rises even higher it could wreck the government's broader recovery plan. Olympics/sport The Olympics are coming to London but the feelgood factor is being spread around. There will be football at St James' Park in Newcastle and Old Trafford in Manchester, along with sailing in Weymouth Bay. By the time of the opening ceremony, organisers hope that almost 11m tickets will have been sold. Tourist revenue should be up, with hopes that visitors will take the time to hop on the train to visit all corners of the country. A clutch of gold medals will make everyone forget David Cameron's broken Britain slogan. England are also in the European football championship in June, which could encourage more spending on barbecue food and drink. But it's hard to see a victory and 1966-style increase in productivity. Verdict The near \u00a310bn cost should spread some cheer, though one thinktank warned that the games could disappoint after Beijing's extravaganza. Queen's jubilee The diamond jubilee is gearing up to be the mother of all tea parties, with cynics and republicans cast aside in favour of joyfulness and, probably, more huge sales of food and drink. There is the Big Lunch \u2013 a sort of community street party \u2013 and the pageant on the Thames, when up to 1,000 boats will chug up the Thames. The Queen will travel in the royal barge. Verdict At a time of deep uncertainty over the UK's economic situation, the celebration could bring back the feelgood factor that put in an appearance at Will and Kate's wedding last year.",

      "body": "<p>On a down day for the market, <strong>Associated British Foods</strong> lost 1.5% after its latest trading update showed signs of a slowdown at its discount retailer Primark.</p> <p>ABF, which also owns Silver Spoon sugar, Twinings tea and Kingsmill bread, said Primark's like for like sales growth for the first half was expected to be up by 2%, compared to expectations of around 3%. The company said Primark sales had got off to a slow start due to the warm autumn but had done well over Christmas. But operating margins continued to be hit by higher cotton prices, although it expected to see the benefits of a subsequent dip in raw material costs in the second half. Martin Deboo at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> We read ABF's first half update as neutral for the consensus. Below the headline level are the usual moving parts, with sugars even stronger and grocery weaker relative to our forecasts. Primark looks to be in line with our expectations at the profit level, but the second quarter like for like looks to have slowed slightly relative to the first quarter. <br> The first half like for like in Primark is 2%.

      "bodyText": "On a down day for the market, Associated British Foods lost 1.5% after its latest trading update showed signs of a slowdown at its discount retailer Primark. ABF, which also owns Silver Spoon sugar, Twinings tea and Kingsmill bread, said Primark's like for like sales growth for the first half was expected to be up by 2%, compared to expectations of around 3%. The company said Primark sales had got off to a slow start due to the warm autumn but had done well over Christmas. But operating margins continued to be hit by higher cotton prices, although it expected to see the benefits of a subsequent dip in raw material costs in the second half. Martin Deboo at Investec said: We read ABF's first half update as neutral for the consensus. Below the headline level are the usual moving parts, with sugars even stronger and grocery weaker relative to our forecasts. Primark looks to be in line with our expectations at the profit level, but the second quarter like for like looks to have slowed slightly relative to the first quarter. The first half like for like in Primark is 2%. The first quarter [figure] was not disclosed, but we estimated it at around 3%. So the arithmetic points to a slowdown in the second quarter, which ABF hint at in the update.

Progress is slow. At the key level, pre-tax profits for 2011 fell 6% to $17.7bn. A year ago, Gulliver set a target of a cost-to-income ratio of 48%-52% by the end of 2013. Last year, however, HSBC travelled away from the target, rather than closer to it \u2013 the ratio rose from 55.2% to 57.5%. Meeting the target on time is now regarded as \"challenging\". The problem is not Gulliver's enthusiasm for cost-cutting; it's the sluggish growth in the income line, notwithstanding all that trade flowing between China and South America.

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Tucked in the small print of the payroll tax bill is a work-sharing plan that could save more than a million jobs this year", 
      "body": "<p>One of the little-noticed items attached to the extension of the payroll tax cut was a <a href=\"http://news.providencejournal.com/breaking-news/2012/02/us-payroll-tax.html\">provision that would promote work-sharing</a> as part of state unemployment insurance systems. The provision, which is based on a bill introduced in the Senate by Jack Reed and in the House by Rosa DeLuaro, would reimburse states for money spent on work-sharing programs that are part of their unemployment insurance system. It would also provide funds for the states that do not currently have work-sharing systems to establish them. </p> <p>This provision is a rare victory of bipartisanship and commonsense. The basic logic of work-sharing is straightforward. Under the current system of unemployment insurance, workers who lose their jobs can get roughly half of their pay in benefits. However, if a worker has their hours cut back because of inadequate demand, they don't get in any way compensated for the lost pay. This effectively encourages employers to go the route of layoffs, rather than shortening work hours, since that is the only way that workers can benefit from unemployment insurance.</p> <p>Work-sharing gets around this asymmetry. It allows workers to be compensated for part of their lost pay when their employer reduces their work hours. This means that if an employer decides to reduce the work hours of 50 workers by 20%, as opposed to laying off 10 workers, the 50 workers can get half of their lost pay (10% of their total pay) covered by unemployment insurance.

      "bodyText": "One of the little-noticed items attached to the extension of the payroll tax cut was a provision that would promote work-sharing as part of state unemployment insurance systems. The provision, which is based on a bill introduced in the Senate by Jack Reed and in the House by Rosa DeLuaro, would reimburse states for money spent on work-sharing programs that are part of their unemployment insurance system. It would also provide funds for the states that do not currently have work-sharing systems to establish them. This provision is a rare victory of bipartisanship and commonsense. The basic logic of work-sharing is straightforward. Under the current system of unemployment insurance, workers who lose their jobs can get roughly half of their pay in benefits. However, if a worker has their hours cut back because of inadequate demand, they don't get in any way compensated for the lost pay. This effectively encourages employers to go the route of layoffs, rather than shortening work hours, since that is the only way that workers can benefit from unemployment insurance. Work-sharing gets around this asymmetry. It allows workers to be compensated for part of their lost pay when their employer reduces their work hours. This means that if an employer decides to reduce the work hours of 50 workers by 20%, as opposed to laying off 10 workers, the 50 workers can get half of their lost pay (10% of their total pay) covered by unemployment insurance. This means that workers will end up working 20% fewer hours for roughly 10% less pay. This is an outcome that is likely to better for workers, employers, and the economy as a whole. It is better for workers because it keeps them on the job and in a situation where they can be continually upgrading their skills in accordance with changes in the workplace. By contrast, workers who are unemployed for long periods of time have great difficulty getting re-employed. Employers are reluctant to hire workers who have been out of the workforce for one to two years or longer. Unfortunately, a large number of workers now fall into this category. Work-sharing can also be beneficial to employers as many firms that have gone this route have discovered.

The bonus pool for the investment bankers was down to $1.2bn from $1.6bn while the entire bank's bonus pool was $4.2bn, unchanged on the year. Profits in the investment bank fell 24% to $7bn while the commercial bank made record profits of $8bn. Gulliver, who has embarked on a cost-cutting programme since taking the helm a year ago, said 2011 was a year of \"major progress\". \"We gained traction in our strategy designed to simplify the structure and improve the management and control of the group,\" he said. But while he achieved his goals on bolstering the bank's financial strength and its dividend policy, he missed targets on other elements of financial performance such as return on equity and improving costs.",
