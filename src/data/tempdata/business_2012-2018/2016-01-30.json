      "bodyText": "Making a living as a musician is hard. Justin Bieber might sleep on a mattress stuffed with dollar bills in a house made of Rolex watches and Ferrari parts, but down at the other end of the scale, for working performers, life can be tough. Sheffield duo Slow Club have released three increasingly successful albums and sold out venues such as London\u2019s 2,000 capacity Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire. Their videos have been viewed more than 3 million times on YouTube and their songs playlisted on BBC 6 Music, yet singer Rebecca Taylor was essentially homeless for five years, bouncing between friends\u2019 sofas in London, her parents\u2019 house in Sheffield and hotel rooms she\u2019d have to share with the rest of the band. \u201cThe toll it takes on your mind is the worst bit,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly feeling like a burden, constantly feeling you\u2019re not pulling your weight. It\u2019s a low-income job. You can do it, but it\u2019s a compromise. What a lot of people take for granted \u2013 the security of a wage, a pension, and anything around it, like a holiday \u2013 you just can\u2019t have that.\u201d For every rock\u2019n\u2019roll millionaire there are thousands of talented artists scratching out a living. The choice is a tricky one: to establish a career takes an enormous amount of work and time and essentially prevents you from having a stable, salaried job. At the same time, especially for new artists, it has virtually no income of its own, meaning it\u2019s impossible to begin a career in music without a second income of some sort, which will always have its own commitments that prevent a musical career progressing. The cycle is difficult to break. When the Leeds punk band Brawlers scored a deal with a major booking agent after their second gig, they assumed their career was about to take off. They weren\u2019t prepared for exactly what that meant. \u201cWe got drunk that night thinking, \u2018This is amazing, we\u2019ve made it,\u2019 \u201d says singer Harry Johns. \u201cThen our agent\u2019s job becomes, \u2018This is a small punk band, just get them out.\u2019 So every month we\u2019d get an email through saying you\u2019re going to go here, there, playing this\u2026 but we\u2019re a tiny band of course, so we\u2019re getting \u00a350 a night. It costs \u00a3130 to do anything a night when you include paying for petrol and a van.\u201d Brawlers were gaining momentum, getting radio plays from XFM and Radio 1, and coverage from all the right punk press, but the four members of the band were unable to earn money from it. A year later they had sacrificed girlfriends, houses, and even their original drummer to the lifestyle of a working punk band, constantly touring and playing anywhere between 15 and 30 gigs every month. They had a growing reputation as a ferocious live act and a well-received album in the shops, but things had barely improved. \u201cAfter a year of smashing your head against the wall, you\u2019re now getting \u00a3160 a gig but it\u2019s still costing \u00a3130, so we\u2019re making \u00a330 profit. There\u2019s four of us, plus a driver, and a guy who does merch and helps guitar tech \u2013 that\u2019s a small crew. We\u2019re giving up a day where we could all have earned \u00a340-\u00a360 working in a bar or an office to make \u00a34.50 each.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound like much of a life. \u201cMy rent\u2019s going to come out in four or five days and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to pay it,\u201d says Johns. \u201cI might be able to afford to cook a nice meal for my girlfriend tonight. I might. We just look forward to going on tour where we don\u2019t have to spend any money.\u201d In the meantime? \u201cMe and our drummer convinced my mate to let us live in his basement. We\u2019ll share a shower and kitchenette and both sleep in sleeping bags on the floor.\u201d I\u2019m in a band myself, The Men That Will Not Be Blamed for Nothing. We have a healthy, if rather niche following. We\u2019ve just had our most successful year yet, releasing our third album to relative acclaim (\u201cprobably the maddest, most original punk band around\u201d said Louder Than War\u2019s 9/10 review), playing an entire summer of festivals, including Glastonbury, Bestival and Secret Garden Party, and embarking on a two-week UK tour, selling roughly 100 tickets a night in smallish venues, and five times that in London. We don\u2019t have a label or management; we\u2019re a cottage industry and meet all the costs for recording and manufacture ourselves, but on the other hand, keep 100% of our profits. Last year was a successful one, but in the end, once everything had been paid off, accounting for record sales, online streams, merchandise sales, festival fees and gig tickets, the band made \u00a3843 each. Most of that will be spent on plane tickets and visa fees for a three-week US tour which, if we\u2019re lucky, will just about break even. A year of great experiences, granted, but one for which we\u2019d all given up paid work and sacrificed time with our partners and families. Which is fine for us, because we have other jobs and understanding partners, but seems to prove that playing in a band simply can\u2019t work as a career in itself. Can it? Taylor has been in Slow Club for a decade now, having started in 2006 when she was still at school. She\u2019s currently working on a solo project under the name Self Esteem, while working towards a fourth Slow Club album. Music is her full-time job. Between money coming in from royalties and publishing, merch sales and, crucially, money received from syncs \u2013 where their music is used for adverts or TV \u2013 Taylor and guitarist Charles Watson are able to pay themselves a monthly salary. It\u2019s not much \u2013 you\u2019d earn more working full time in McDonald\u2019s \u2013 but it means she can get by. \u201cIt\u2019s enough money to let the band live,\u201d says Taylor, \u201cand we don\u2019t go beyond our means, ever. We scrimp and save. We\u2019ve only, just now, started to get more than one Travelodge room on tour, even though there\u2019s six of us. I\u2019m 29 and I\u2019ve only just got to where I don\u2019t have to share a room with four boys every night. The secret to our success has been never feeling like we\u2019ve made it, or done it, so we never spend anything we don\u2019t have, and when we do it\u2019s got to be painfully important.\u201d She adds: \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an out-and-out record deal until this last album, but that money pays for the musicians we take on tour and record with. The two of us in the band are the lowest earners by a mile. Eventually you start sitting back a bit and saying \u2018Is that fair?\u2019 and, well, it\u2019s not fair. But that\u2019s how it is. We\u2019re lucky, we found players who are lovely. They could ask for a lot more money, but instead they\u2019ll do shit for free, not often, but they will. Our heads are only above the tide because it\u2019s only two of us that write, we\u2019ve done syncs pretty consistently and we\u2019re Scrooges. We\u2019ve got nothing. I am essentially skint. I guess I\u2019ve developed into a human being that\u2019s fine with that.\u201d The music industry has been in steady decline since the early 2000s as illegal downloads and then the rise of streaming took gargantuan chunks out of record sales. The situation is not improving, with global revenue for music dipping below $14bn for the first time in 2014. It was $40bn in 1998. Understandably this hits artists not shored up by the big labels the hardest. Nothing in music pays what it once did, and the decline will likely continue. \u201cThe money we get from TV and advertising syncs was double back in 2009,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cI try not to think about how much we\u2019d have been earning 15 years ago. Our records sell more now, but it costs us a grand to do a gig [because of how the band and the music has expanded], when it used to just cost the price of petrol. It\u2019s an impossible situation really.\u201d For Taylor, living so close to the line means constant anxiety about the future. \u201cI live with this fear that it\u2019ll all end and I\u2019ll have to get a real job. I\u2019ve now done 10 years of being this useless baby-woman who has no skills except that I can sing. You\u2019re in this perpetual state of being a teenager, and that\u2019s terrifying. I think a lot about it. I\u2019m obsessed with it \u2013 the idea that one day I won\u2019t be able to do this. Then you get a call saying \u2018They\u2019ve put your song on an internet advert and a few grand\u2019s coming in\u2019. I live my life like that.\u201d Dan Wale, finance manager at DEF, a management company that looks after the affairs of huge sellers like Moby, The Knife and R\u00f6yksopp, as well as completely new acts, says artists need to start letting go of the idea of music as a sole occupation in itself. \u201cA \u2018career\u2019 in music is a pretty rare thing,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has after all been a fairly small window in time whereby a musician has been able to make very large amounts of money from their craft, and even then it\u2019s only been a fraction of the overall number of people doing it \u2013 all of them for the love of it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in an industry where over 90% of releases never recoup the money spent on them,\u201d he says. \u201cThe industry underwrites failure as a necessary part of its operation and looks to the supercharged successes of a very small number of artists to cover the losses. That\u2019s pretty dysfunctional. The number one challenge facing a new artist is a financial one: become profitable or cease to exist in the medium to long term.\u201d Wale believes that by thinking on a more realistic scale, and with advances in technology, it is still possible to make an income from music. \u201cI think now, more so than ever, it\u2019s very possible \u2013 especially for a solo artist \u2013 to make a cottage-industry scale success without any outside help whatsoever. Obviously this has been facilitated greatly by the internet and the emergence of online networks, fan-supported releases and a number of great discovery platforms. All the tools are really there for someone to go out and do it themselves.\u201d However, he admits that if an act wants to make playing music their sole living, the traditional industry model must kick in at some point. \u201cUnfortunately the tipping point to becoming something larger still depends on the ability of an artist to obtain a recording/distribution deal and the commitment of marketing money that entails \u2013 along with access to the routes to market that they still dominate,\u201d he says. It\u2019s easy to see how a musician can become locked into the failing music industry model. Working within the system can still yield results, though. Last year Taylor, after five years of sofa surfing, was able to buy a small house in Margate, bucking trends as both a first-time buyer and a musician. Good timing and crafty accounting has meant that the self-confessed \u201cbaby-woman\u201d with the perilous income stream has been able to get on the property ladder. \u201cI was accidentally savvy,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t really going to give it to me, but my mortgage adviser was really experienced at working with musicians and was able to present me in the best light: it was the year we did our last album, and our record deal money and publishing had come in. It looked like I was running a viable business, plus I got a tax rebate, and got a job as the world\u2019s worst PA for a few months while the band was quiet. It looked like plenty, even though most of it went straight back out again and I\u2019m now hand to mouth. It\u2019s all smoke and mirrors. That\u2019s the only way I could do it.\u201d Playing in a band, performing of any type really, is a calling, not a career, clearly. It can be hyper-successful, but for most people it involves sacrificing security and comfort for a lifestyle that is as frightening as it is exciting. To some it must seem like a baffling choice \u2013 my Dad is constantly bewildered that I give up all my free time for something I basically don\u2019t get paid for \u2013 and it\u2019s tough admitting to my girlfriend that every bit of my annual leave that year is going on recording and touring\u2026 again. But then, standing onstage at Glastonbury with a rammed tent of 300 people singing along to a song I wrote in my bedroom \u2013 that\u2019s when it feels more than worth it. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m living it. I\u2019m doing it,\u201d says Taylor, \u201cand that all adds up to enough to say it\u2019s fine that I don\u2019t have a car, or I don\u2019t go to Tenerife every year for two weeks. I\u2019m happy with it. I\u2019m actually just really thankful. If I\u2019m not a singer in a band, then I\u2019m dead.\u201d",

I live my life like that.\u201d</p> <p>Dan Wale, finance manager at DEF, a management company that looks after the affairs of huge sellers like Moby, The Knife and R\u00f6yksopp, as well as completely new acts, says artists need to start letting go of the idea of music as a sole occupation in itself. \u201cA \u2018career\u2019 in music is a pretty rare thing,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt has after all been a fairly small window in time whereby a musician has been able to make very large amounts of money from their craft, and even then it\u2019s only been a fraction of the overall number of people doing it \u2013 all of them for the love of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in an industry where over 90% of releases never recoup the money spent on them,\u201d he says. \u201cThe industry underwrites failure as a necessary part of its operation and looks to the supercharged successes of a very small number of artists to cover the losses. That\u2019s pretty dysfunctional. The number one challenge facing a new artist is a financial one: become profitable or cease to exist in the medium to long term.\u201d</p> <p>Wale believes that by thinking on a more realistic scale, and with advances in technology, it is still possible to make an income from music. \u201cI think now, more so than ever, it\u2019s very possible \u2013 especially for a solo artist \u2013 to make a cottage-industry scale success without any outside help whatsoever. Obviously this has been facilitated greatly by the internet and the emergence of online networks, fan-supported releases and a number of great discovery platforms. All the tools are really there for someone to go out and do it themselves.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCtHncEMLVg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eCtHncEMLVg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch Slow Club\u2019s video for Complete Surrender.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>However, he admits that if an act wants to make playing music their sole living, the traditional industry model must kick in at some point. \u201cUnfortunately the tipping point to becoming something larger still depends on the ability of an artist to obtain a recording/distribution deal and the commitment of marketing money that entails \u2013 along with access to the routes to market that they still dominate,\u201d he says. It\u2019s easy to see how a musician can become locked into the failing music industry model.</p> <p>Working within the system can still yield results, though. Last year Taylor, after five years of sofa surfing, was able to buy a small house in Margate, bucking trends as both a first-time buyer and a musician. Good timing and crafty accounting has meant that the self-confessed \u201cbaby-woman\u201d with the perilous income stream has been able to get on the property ladder. \u201cI was accidentally savvy,\u201d she says. \u201cThey weren\u2019t really going to give it to me, but my mortgage adviser was really experienced at working with musicians and was able to present me in the best light: it was the year we did our last album, and our record deal money and publishing had come in. It looked like I was running a viable business, plus I got a tax rebate, and got a job as the world\u2019s worst PA for a few months while the band was quiet. It looked like plenty, even though most of it went straight back out again and I\u2019m now hand to mouth. It\u2019s all smoke and mirrors. That\u2019s the only way I could do it.\u201d</p> <p>Playing in a band, performing of any type really, is a calling, not a career, clearly. It can be hyper-successful, but for most people it involves sacrificing security and comfort for a lifestyle that is as frightening as it is exciting. To some it must seem like a baffling choice \u2013 my Dad is constantly bewildered that I give up all my free time for something I basically don\u2019t get paid for \u2013 and it\u2019s tough admitting to my girlfriend that every bit of my annual leave that year is going on recording and touring\u2026 again. But then, standing onstage at Glastonbury with a rammed tent of 300 people singing along to a song I wrote in my bedroom \u2013 that\u2019s when it feels more than worth it.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m living it. I\u2019m doing it,\u201d says Taylor, \u201cand that all adds up to enough to say it\u2019s fine that I don\u2019t have a car, or I don\u2019t go to Tenerife every year for two weeks. I\u2019m happy with it. I\u2019m actually just really thankful. If I\u2019m not a singer in a band, then I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 150 students in two halls of residence at University College London are currently on a rent strike, demanding a 40% cut in their weekly accommodation fees. The problem is places like Max Rayne House \u2013 a self-catered student house where a twin room costs \u00a3102.97 a week while a one-bed flat is \u00a3232.40 and bathrooms are shared between 10-13 people. David Dahlborn, a third-year history student and one of the campaigners, reckons the rising rents \u201cwill lead to a growing student debt crisis\u201d and says the blame for increasing costs lies at least partly with new specialist private providers of student accommodation, who are in the business for profit. He says: \u201cThe private sector is pushing rents up year after year, and universities like UCL are pushing their rent up as well.\u201d Building and providing student accommodation is a growing sector of the property market. Investors have been piling in, including private equity firms, to take advantage of the boom in purpose-built student housing. A record \u00a36bn was invested in it last year \u2013 more than in north America, according to law firm Addleshaw Goddard. Investors are attracted by the high income returns due to strong demand: students numbers are rising every year and there is a shortage of adequate accommodation. Last year a record 532,300 new students started at university and numbers are likely to keep rising after the cap on domestic and EU students at English universities was lifted last year. Some of the accommodation now being built is a world away from Max Rayne House and traditional student halls. They include studio flats or en suite rooms with luxury showers, fast broadband, kitchens with stainless steel appliances and dishwashers, 24-hour security, on-site gyms and cinemas. And they charge rents way out of the budget of most students. Overlooking Westminster Bridge in central London, Urbanest\u2019s silver-clad oval tower bears a closer resemblance to an office block. It opened in September and houses 1,140 students over 18 floors, with a gym and swimming pool in the basement. There\u2019s also a 33-storey skyscraper built by American private equity firm Blackstone in the City of London that houses up to 1,140 students. It has a bar and lounge on the top floors, along with a gym, library, cafes, post room, cinema, games and karaoke rooms. En suite rooms in two-bedroom apartments start at \u00a3265 a week and go up to \u00a3495. Single studio flats are \u00a3385-\u00a3699 a week. Hollie Packman, a third-year chemistry student at UCL, says: \u201cI know very few people apart from international students who could afford that.\u201d She pays \u00a3150 rent a week for a two-bed council flat in Camden shared by four people. A lot of London students have to live far out and commute to university, she says. The new private residences are popular with overseas and postgraduate students, who are more likely to be able to afford them, especially in central London. At Urbanest, less than a third of residents are British, 13% are American and 12% Chinese. Last week, US investment bank Goldman Sachs set up a new student housing venture called Vero Group. It is combining Wellcome\u2019s student housing, which Wellcome has been investing in since 2007, with units already owned by property fund Greystar. Vero starts with a portfolio of 23,500 beds in 25 towns and an ambition to become the UK\u2019s leading student accommodation provider. The biggest such company currently is the FTSE 250 listed Unite Group, with 46,000 beds across the UK. It charges up to \u00a3230 a week in central London and \u00a3120-\u00a3140 in the regions. Studios in central London, however, cost \u00a3350 or more a week. Chief executive Mark Allan compares it to running a large-scale hotel business. \u201cThe operators are more professional and better capitalised [than in the past]. That\u2019s better for universities and students.\u201d Shelly Asquith, the National Union of Students\u2019 vice-president for welfare, says that the private sector is on track to become the main supplier of purpose-built student accommodation nationally by 2018 \u2013 it already is in London \u2013 and wants to ensure it caters for all students, not just wealthy ones. She is worried about the growth of studio flats, particularly in London. \u201cThis is the most expensive student accommodation being provided in the centre of one of the most expensive cities in the world: of course it is nice, but is it really serving an educational need?\u201d Asquith says. \u201cWhat is certain is that it is pulling rent levels to new heights \u2013 well over \u00a310,000 a year for a small studio flat. We may be at the point where enough is enough.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "The future of e-commerce: bricks and mortar", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Remember when the future of retail was online? Now it seems that online retailers have decided they can\u2019t get by without bricks and mortar. Amazon raised eyebrows in November when it opened its first brick and mortar extension \u2013 a bookstore in Seattle\u2019s University Village. The online giant\u2019s rise, after all, is blamed for laying waste to independent bookshops across the country. But Amazon is only among the latest, if largest, e-commerce players to take a stab at traditional retail after starting life online. In the last few years, some 20 online companies in the US have launched a physical presence to better market their wares, forge closer customer relations, and yes, boost online traffic and sales. Amazon aside, these include mostly specialty and clothing stores such as Warby Parker, Bonobos, Birchbox and Casper. The trend also reflects the broader industry imperative around \u201comni-channel\u201d retailing, where merchants aim to provide customers with a seamless experience whether shopping online via desktop or mobile device or at a traditional retail store. Underscoring that point, the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual \u201cBig Show\u201d conference in New York earlier this month featured half a dozen sessions that included the term in their titles. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to launch a brand these days that\u2019s just online-only. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult and crowded e-commerce environment,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. She noted there are more than 800,000 online stores, all vying to attract customers through the gateway of Google. Online real estate has become crowded and expensive. Bidding on keywords against the likes of Amazon and large traditional retailers to land on the first page of search results is a costly game. Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, spent an estimated $6.4m and $4m, respectively, in paid search listings for the top 1,000 apparel-related keywords in the first quarter of 2015, according to a study this month from L2 Inc, a research firm that tracks digital brands. \u201cClicks disproportionately go to the highest-placed search ads, with little room for differentiation,\u201d states the L2 report, which examines what it calls \u201cevolved retailers\u201d \u2013 online merchants that have opened brick and mortar storefronts. By opening physical stores, they aim to increase awareness and draw customers in a realm where the retail options aren\u2019t infinite or influenced by an all-powerful gatekeeper. And for purveyors of tactile and personal products like clothing, eyewear and jewelry, selling stuff in person has an obvious appeal. For many, the offline foray has started with a trial pop-up shop before launching flagship stores in high-profile shopping districts like New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood or Chicago\u2019s Michigan Avenue. Encouraged by the results, some have since expanded quickly. \u201cThe big benefit of the flagship stores is that they\u2019re terrific marketing vehicles,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, senior vice-president of commerce and content at digital agency Razorfish. \u201cNot only do those stores tend to be economically successful on their own but they generate a huge lift in incremental shopping to the online store.\u201d That\u2019s been the case for Warby Parker, which has created a popular brand by selling stylish eyeglass frames for under $100. After starting online in 2010, it opened its Soho flagship three years later and now has 20 stores nationwide, with plans to add another 20 this year. Co-founder and co-chief executive Dave Gilboa said Warby Parker stores that have been open at least two years are already profitable. \u201cWe also see a halo effect where stores themselves become a great generator of awareness for our brand and drive a lot of traffic to our website, as well and accelerate our e-commerce sales,\u201d he added. Gilboa declined to disclose actual sales figures but the company\u2019s rapid ascent hasn\u2019t been lost on investors. T Rowe Price last spring led a $100m round of funding in Warby Parker at a reported $1.2bn valuation, making it a so-called unicorn. While someone can leave a Warby Parker store sporting a new pair of glasses, other e-tailers have opened what are essentially showrooms. This approach allows customers to size and sample products while minimizing real estate and other traditional retail costs. Among the best-known brands adopting this model is menswear shop Bonobos. Billed as \u201cguideshops\u201d, its 20 stores let customers try on clothing while orders are placed online for home delivery. The concept is that men want to shop in stores, but don\u2019t necessarily want to leave toting shopping bags. \u201cThis supported our idea of using Bonobos.com as the place to fulfill orders, so we didn\u2019t have to worry about stocking inventory in a location and we could focus more on the customer experience,\u201d said Erin Ersenkal, Bonobos\u2019 chief revenue officer. The average order size in Bonobos\u2019 stores has proven to be twice that of online, with a higher proportion of new customers also coming through the guideshops. Similarly, jewelry e-tailer Blue Nile last year opened its first standalone outpost in the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island for similar reasons to Bonobos. \u201cConsumers\u2019 No 1 objection to buying [jewelry] online is not being able to see and touch and feel the product,\u201d explained CEO Harvey Kanter. Purchases are still made online, where the company says prices are typically 20% to 40% lower than its traditional counterparts. Unlike others embracing brick and mortar, publicly traded Blue Nile is hardly a startup. Founded in 1999, it survived the dotcom bust, and is on track this year for revenue of about $500m. So why hit the mall now? Compared with other e-commerce categories, jewelry still has low penetration online, said Kanter. Venturing offline is a way to spur higher growth. Since opening last June, Blue Nile has seen a lift in traffic and sales in the region around its initial Long Island location. As such, it plans to open another three or four \u201cWebrooms\u201d in the first six months of 2016. As Blue Nile and other e-tailers branch out, though, don\u2019t expect them to pop up on Main Street. Given the focus on marketing, marquee locations in select cities are more likely to be their turf. \u201cTheir economic future isn\u2019t tied to opening a store in Montana or Idaho or some of those smaller markets,\u201d said Razorfish\u2019s Goldberg. Even so, Claude de Jocas, research lead on the L2 study, said the benefits of economies of scale could lead to adding more locations. \u201cSome are also beefing up their physical retail teams with senior-level hires, suggesting aggressive expansion plans are in the works,\u201d she said. So what about Amazon? Its bookstore is closely linked to its website. Amazon Books\u2019 5,000 titles are selected based on customer ratings and pre-orders on Amazon.com. Each book is displayed face-out with a barcode to check pricing using its app. The outlet also lets people test drive its devices like the Kindle e-reader and Fire tablets. Amazon didn\u2019t respond to media inquiries, and has previously declined comment on plans for additional locations. Jennifer Cast, vice-president for Amazon Books, told the Seattle Times in November: \u201cWe hope it\u2019s not the only one. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d Other \u201cevolved\u201d retailers probably hope Amazon doesn\u2019t adapt well to selling on land.",

      "body": "<p>Remember when the future of retail was online? Now it seems that online retailers have decided they can\u2019t get by without bricks and mortar.</p> <p>Amazon raised eyebrows in November when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/21/amazon-books-opens-seattle-independent-bookstores\">opened its first brick and mortar extension</a> \u2013 a bookstore in Seattle\u2019s University Village. The online giant\u2019s rise, after all, is blamed for laying waste to independent bookshops across the country.<br></p> <p>But Amazon is only among the latest, if largest, e-commerce players to take a stab at traditional retail after starting life online.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/05/amazon-book-store-seattle\">Amazon boldly goes where no internet bookseller has gone before: the real world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the last few years, some 20 online companies in the US have launched a physical presence to better market their wares, forge closer customer relations, and yes, boost online traffic and sales. Amazon aside, these include mostly specialty and clothing stores such as Warby Parker, Bonobos, Birchbox and Casper.<br></p> <p>The trend also reflects the broader industry imperative around \u201comni-channel\u201d retailing, where merchants aim to provide customers with a seamless experience whether shopping online via desktop or mobile device or at a traditional retail store. <br></p> <p>Underscoring that point, the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual \u201cBig Show\u201d conference in New York earlier this month featured half a dozen sessions that included the term in their titles.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to launch a brand these days that\u2019s just online-only. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult and crowded e-commerce environment,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail analyst at Forrester Research. She noted there are more than 800,000 online stores, all vying to attract customers through the gateway of Google.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Online real estate has become crowded and expensive. Bidding on keywords against the likes of Amazon and large traditional retailers to land on the first page of search results is a costly game.<br></p> <p>Macy\u2019s and Nordstrom, for example, spent an estimated $6.4m and $4m, respectively, in paid search listings for the top 1,000 apparel-related keywords in the first quarter of 2015, according to a study this month from <a href=\"http://www.l2inc.com\">L2 Inc</a>, a research firm that tracks digital brands. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cClicks disproportionately go to the highest-placed search ads, with little room for differentiation,\u201d states the L2 report, which examines what it calls \u201cevolved retailers\u201d \u2013 online merchants that have opened brick and mortar storefronts.</p> <p>By opening physical stores, they aim to increase awareness and draw customers in a realm where the retail options aren\u2019t infinite or influenced by an all-powerful gatekeeper. And for purveyors of tactile and personal products like clothing, eyewear and jewelry, selling stuff in person has an obvious appeal.</p> <p>For many, the offline foray has started with a trial pop-up shop before launching flagship stores in high-profile shopping districts like New York\u2019s SoHo neighborhood or Chicago\u2019s Michigan Avenue. Encouraged by the results, some have since expanded quickly.</p> <p>\u201cThe big benefit of the flagship stores is that they\u2019re terrific marketing vehicles,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, senior vice-president of commerce and content at digital agency Razorfish. \u201cNot only do those stores tend to be economically successful on their own but they generate a huge lift in incremental shopping to the online store.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s been the case for Warby Parker, which has created a popular brand by selling stylish eyeglass frames for under $100. After starting online in 2010, it opened its Soho flagship three years later and now has 20 stores nationwide, with plans to add another 20 this year.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/30/warby-parker-eyewear-valuation-funding-t-rowe-price\">Eyewear upstart Warby Parker valued at $1.2bn after latest round of funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Co-founder and co-chief executive Dave Gilboa said Warby Parker stores that have been open at least two years are already profitable. \u201cWe also see a halo effect where stores themselves become a great generator of awareness for our brand and drive a lot of traffic to our website, as well and accelerate our e-commerce sales,\u201d he added. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Gilboa declined to disclose actual sales figures but the company\u2019s rapid ascent hasn\u2019t been lost on investors. T Rowe Price last spring led a $100m round of funding in Warby Parker at a reported $1.2bn valuation, making it a so-called unicorn.</p> <p>While someone can leave a Warby Parker store sporting a new pair of glasses, other e-tailers have opened what are essentially showrooms. This approach allows customers to size and sample products while minimizing real estate and other traditional retail costs.</p> <p>Among the best-known brands adopting this model is menswear shop Bonobos. Billed as \u201cguideshops\u201d, its 20 stores let customers try on clothing while orders are placed online for home delivery.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>The concept is that men want to shop in stores, but don\u2019t necessarily want to leave toting shopping bags. \u201cThis supported our idea of using Bonobos.com as the place to fulfill orders, so we didn\u2019t have to worry about stocking inventory in a location and we could focus more on the customer experience,\u201d said Erin Ersenkal, Bonobos\u2019 chief revenue officer. </p> <p>The average order size in Bonobos\u2019 stores has proven to be twice that of online, with a higher proportion of new customers also coming through the guideshops.</p> <p>Similarly, jewelry e-tailer Blue Nile last year opened its first standalone outpost in the Roosevelt Field mall on Long Island for similar reasons to Bonobos. \u201cConsumers\u2019 No 1 objection to buying [jewelry] online is not being able to see and touch and feel the product,\u201d explained CEO Harvey Kanter.</p> <p>Purchases are still made online, where the company says prices are typically 20% to 40% lower than its traditional counterparts.<br></p> <p>Unlike others embracing brick and mortar, publicly traded Blue Nile is hardly a startup. Founded in 1999, it survived the dotcom bust, and is on track this year for revenue of about $500m. So why hit the mall now?</p> <p>Compared with other e-commerce categories, jewelry still has low penetration online, said Kanter. Venturing offline is a way to spur higher growth. Since opening last June, Blue Nile has seen a lift in traffic and sales in the region around its initial Long Island location. As such, it plans to open another three or four \u201cWebrooms\u201d in the first six months of 2016.</p> <p>As Blue Nile and other e-tailers branch out, though, don\u2019t expect them to pop up on Main Street. Given the focus on marketing, marquee locations in select cities are more likely to be their turf. \u201cTheir economic future isn\u2019t tied to opening a store in Montana or Idaho or some of those smaller markets,\u201d said Razorfish\u2019s Goldberg.<br></p> <p>Even so, Claude de Jocas, research lead on the L2 study, said the benefits of economies of scale could lead to adding more locations. \u201cSome are also beefing up their physical retail teams with senior-level hires, suggesting aggressive expansion plans are in the works,\u201d she said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>So what about Amazon? Its bookstore is closely linked to its website. Amazon Books\u2019 5,000 titles are selected based on customer ratings and pre-orders on Amazon.com. Each book is displayed face-out with a barcode to check pricing using its app. The outlet also lets people test drive its devices like the Kindle e-reader and Fire tablets.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Amazon didn\u2019t respond to media inquiries, and has previously declined comment on plans for additional locations. Jennifer Cast, vice-president for Amazon Books, told <a href=\"http://bit.ly/0oYJBE\">the Seattle Times</a> in November: \u201cWe hope it\u2019s not the only one. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d<br></p> <p>Other \u201cevolved\u201d retailers probably hope Amazon doesn\u2019t adapt well to selling on land.</p>",
