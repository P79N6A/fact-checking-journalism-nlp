      "bodyText": "It's an offer that sounds too good to be true \u2013 an entire school uniform for just \u00a34. For less than the cost of a week's school dinners you can put two polo shirts, a sweater and a pair of trousers or skirt in your shopping trolley along with your groceries at German discounter Aldi. Back-to-school is always a key battleground for the major retailers as the school holidays get under way but Aldi's aggressive entry into the schoolwear market has prompted the kind of price shock not seen since the heady days of the \u00a32 Asda chicken back in 2007. The big question is how is it possible to make, let alone ship halfway across the world and then sell a uniform for such a low price? \"It's a crazy price,\" says Douglas Miller, emeritus professor of worker rights in fashion at University of Northumbria. \"You really do have to ask questions about the conditions and the sourcing of this stuff. You are talking about mass, mass production.\" For Asda the \u00a32 chicken was a loss leader designed to lure customers into the store where it hoped they would buy more profitable products at the same time and it is possible that Aldi is using the same tactic or accepting a much smaller profit margin that is usual for clothing retailers. After spiking in 2010 on the back of floods in Pakistan and other crop problems, the price of cotton has fallen substantially as higher global stocks and weaker demand from China pulls down prices. The sweatshirt the Guardian was sent by Aldi, which is for a child aged 4-5, weighed 160g and according to industry experts would require 300g of cotton fibre to make as losses occur during manufacturing. On Friday the Cotton A Index Price \u2013 an internationally recognised benchmark for a daily cotton price \u2013 showed 83.05 cents per lb of cotton fibre which works out at 54.8 cents(32.25p) for 300g. But on top of the raw material a retailer has to factor in many other costs such as knitting and dyeing the fabric, labour costs and transporting the finished goods. With the help of a cotton specialist and former fashion buyer the Guardian attempted to break down the cost of a producing a 100% cotton sweatshirt in Bangladesh for \u00a31.25. Most of the production costs \u2013 just over 70p \u2013 relate to the fabric as the raw cotton has to be knitted and finished, with around 7p to cutting, sewing and trimming, including labour costs. The factory profit is likely to be 11.5p of the finished selling price, with shipping costs of 5p. That would leave Aldi with about 30p to cover the costs of getting the items from the ports to its warehouses, on to its shelves and through the tills. This is a far lower amount than other retailers would accept. Selling prices on fashion are usually at least four times the cost arriving at the port, although grocery retailers are used to working on far smaller margins. Giles Hurley, Aldi's managing director of corporate buying, said: \"Aldi works effectively and efficiently to responsibly make operational savings. Rather than using these savings to boost margins, we use them to reduce prices for our shoppers.\" Sophie Koers of the Fair Wear Foundation, which campaigns to improve labour conditions in the garment industry, said rock-bottom selling prices did not always mean workers suffered more. \"It doesn't mean the workers are paid any less. It could be that the retailer is taking the hit on this one. There's this sense that cheap clothes are worse for workers than making expensive clothes but that is not always true. \"As we see when something goes wrong, like in the Rana Plaza collapse, you see it's cheap and expensive brands coming out of the same factory and workers are not getting paid more for one product than the other.\" But Emma Harbour of the Clean Clothes Campaign says that at best textile workers in Bangladesh receive 2% of a completed item's cost. \"If Aldi are selling a school uniform pack for \u00a34 then it is fair to assume that the workers producing them are earning at most around 8p for the whole pack,\" she says. Aldi is ratcheting up the pressure on its rivals amid a fierce supermarket price war. Both Aldi and German peer Lidl are growing at a breakneck pace in the UK as shoppers defect from the big four supermarkets in search of cheaper prices. Aldi's eye-catching offer is a round neck sweater for \u00a31.25, a two pack of polo shirts for \u00a31.25 and a pair of trousers or skirt for \u00a31.50. At \u00a34 the uniform pack is at least 40% cheaper than its major supermarket rivals. Its competitors are privately suggesting that the uniform may not survive numerous high temperature family washes or the rough and tumble of the playground. Nonetheless, a low-cost school uniform will be welcomed by many parents daunted by the expense of a new school year. Aldi says its schoolwear suppliers have to comply with its social monitoring programme, which requires audit reports from final production sites to ensure they meet our standards. \"We promote workplace practices and conditions that are safe, fair and legal for all those involved in making our products,\" said the company. Its suppliers also have to comply with applicable national laws, industry minimum standards and the International Labour Organisation and United Nations Conventions, it said. Its parent, Aldi South, was one of the first companies to sign up the accord on fire and building safety in Bangladesh introduced following the Rana Plaza tragedy. Bangladeshi factory workers may well be receiving the legal minimum wage for their work but at just 5,300 taka it is about a fifth of the 25,687 taka that campaign group Asia Floor Wage argues is the real living wage for the country which is one of the lowest cost textile producers in the world. Miller says there as many as 5,000 factories in Bangladesh but only 1,200-1,500 are \"first tier\". \"It [\u00a34] is not doable unless at the bottom of the rung in Bangladesh where there is very little worker rights. Aldi's Hurley, however, insisted the grocer was able to deliver the cheapest prices by forming partnerships with suppliers: \"It enables us to offer shoppers some of the best value in the UK, while supporting fair and ethical ways of working.\" How they compare Tesco Sweater \u00a33.00 2 Polo shirts \u00a32.00*^ Skirt/trousers \u00a31.50^ Asda Sweater \u00a32.00 2 Polo shirts \u00a32.50*^ Skirt/trousers \u00a33.00^ Sainsbury's Sweater \u00a32.00 2 Polo shirts \u00a32.33*^ Skirt/trousers \u00a33.00^ * 2pack ^ min price",

      "standfirst": "The Competition and Markets Authority could go after the big beasts, but my money is on further tweaks and tickles", 
      "body": "<p>Who would have thought it, eh? After 25 years in which regulators and politicians merrily waved through almost every UK takeover that crossed their desks, today's competition watchdogs have concluded the banking market is not working well.</p> <p>It turns out that concentration of ownership has not improved competition or standards. Market shares have become entrenched: four banks have 77% of the market for personal accounts and 85% for business accounts. New entrants struggle to make headway. Most customers think most banks are basically the same so annual switching rates are just 3% in personal banking and 4% among small businesses. And, in that small business market, just 13% of firms trust their bank to act in their interests. So says the shiny new Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p> <p>The only big deal ever blocked was Lloyds TSB's cheeky attempt to bag Abbey National in 2001. Yet seven years later, amid the panic of the banking crisis, the Labour government arranged the marriage of Lloyds TSB and on-its-knees HBOS, an even bigger deal. On that occasion the old Competition Commission did object \u2013 but was told to keep its nose out.</p> <p>The subsequent liberation of TSB, on the orders of Brussels, is welcome but hardly a game-changer, according to the CMA. Its cold assessment: \"TSB has a relatively small size and it is unclear at this stage what its overall impact on competition will be.\"</p> <p>In part, then, the state of the banking industry is the predictable outcome of a quarter of a century of consolidation. The justification for the deals was cost-cutting, with gains supposedly finding their way to customers. Costs were certainly removed \u2013 but benefits for customers did not appear in the form of strong investment in, say, slick technology to make banking easier. Instead, we had disgraces such as the gouging of customers with payment protection insurance.</p> <p>What should be done? If a full competition inquiry follows, the CMA could suggest three broad areas of remedies. There are problems with them all.</p> <p>The radical route would be a break-up of the big beasts. For example: let Halifax escape from Lloyds, remove NatWest from Royal Bank of Scotland, and make Barclays reincarnate the Woolwich on the high street. But the costs, which would inevitably rebound on customers, might be hellish. On one tally, Lloyds spent \u00a31.3bn separating TSB. Nor would the exercise be quick. It is taking RBS about half a decade to shed just 314 branches under the Williams &amp; Glyn badge.</p> <p>A second option would be to abolish free in-credit personal banking. The theory here is that current accounts aren't really free because savers pay in the form of lower interest rates and others pay via high overdraft charges and the like. If true costs were forced into the open by making customers pay upfront for personal accounts, perhaps punters would be more inclined to shop around. Price, after all, is what drives behaviour in other markets, as Aldi and Lidl are demonstrating to the other \"big four\", the supermarkets.</p> <p>The CMA will look at the idea. It says the free-if-in-credit model \"may distort competition\". But would a government of any stripe ever declare that everyone should pay \u00a3100-plus a year for a bank account? Whatever the economic models say, the policy doesn't sound like a vote-winner.</p> <p>The third route is more of the same. That is, more regulatory tickling from the wings: lower capital requirements for new entrants; firmer policing of the intra-bank payments system, the source of too many grumbles from small banks; and greater transparency on lending rates in the small business market, aided by enforced sharing of firms' credit histories. The objection here is timidity. Over a decade, those sky-high market shares might be trimmed by only the odd percentage point.</p> <p>Which way should the CMA jump? After umpteen banking reviews, let's see the big options explored. That Lloyds/HBOS merger still looks a gross error, so let's have a proper analysis of the cost of breaking up; ditto RBS. If the CMA feels that killing \"free\" banking would help, it should make the argument whatever the political headaches. Yet more tweaks and tickles would be an admission of regulatory impotence \u2013 depressingly, that outcome is probably the way to bet.</p> <h2>Shire's shares in the spotlight</h2> <p> Shire has negotiated decent terms to be taken over by AbbVie. A price of \u00a331bn \u2013 \u00a352.48 per share \u2013 didn't meet the market's initial high hopes but it's a long way above the \u00a321.50 at which Shire traded a year ago. For good measure, AbbVie will have to cough up \u00a3930m if it walks away because US politicians quash the tax \"inversion\" lark.</p> <p>So it would be unfair to accuse Shire chief executive Flemming Ornskov of selling his shareholders short because he himself stands to collect $9.9m (\u00a35.8m) in cash just to hang around at New AbbVie for a year. All the same, why does he need a retention payment?</p> <p>If Shire was being bought wholly for cash, one could understand AbbVie's thinking: Ornskov's long-term share-based incentives would mature instantly and he might walk away. But this is a cash-and-shares deal billed as \"a merger\". Surely his share-based incentives should just roll into New AbbVie's stock at the merger terms. Then he would have plenty of motivation to stay to make the combo a success.</p> <p>AbbVie's and Shire's joint statement said \"appropriate proposals\" would be put to participants in Shire's share schemes \"in due course\". What does that mean? Will the rollover principle be obeyed or not?</p> <p>If Ornskov and senior colleagues will be cashed-up in full on their long-term incentives, and then paid handsome retention awards on top, they will be collecting twice. That would be a bad precedent, even if the deal itself is good for Shire shareholders. Before New AbbVie starts its strange life as Chicago-headquartered, Jersey-incorporated, UK-domiciled company, it should clear up this point.</p> <p>As for the tax \"inversion,\" US politicians should get their skates on if they want to stop the flow of deals. Jacob Lew, US Treasury secretary, this week accused AbbVie of being \"economically unpatriotic.\"</p> <p>But the company is definitely being economically literate.

      "bodyText": "Who would have thought it, eh? After 25 years in which regulators and politicians merrily waved through almost every UK takeover that crossed their desks, today's competition watchdogs have concluded the banking market is not working well. It turns out that concentration of ownership has not improved competition or standards. Market shares have become entrenched: four banks have 77% of the market for personal accounts and 85% for business accounts. New entrants struggle to make headway. Most customers think most banks are basically the same so annual switching rates are just 3% in personal banking and 4% among small businesses. And, in that small business market, just 13% of firms trust their bank to act in their interests. So says the shiny new Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The only big deal ever blocked was Lloyds TSB's cheeky attempt to bag Abbey National in 2001. Yet seven years later, amid the panic of the banking crisis, the Labour government arranged the marriage of Lloyds TSB and on-its-knees HBOS, an even bigger deal. On that occasion the old Competition Commission did object \u2013 but was told to keep its nose out. The subsequent liberation of TSB, on the orders of Brussels, is welcome but hardly a game-changer, according to the CMA. Its cold assessment: \"TSB has a relatively small size and it is unclear at this stage what its overall impact on competition will be.\" In part, then, the state of the banking industry is the predictable outcome of a quarter of a century of consolidation. The justification for the deals was cost-cutting, with gains supposedly finding their way to customers. Costs were certainly removed \u2013 but benefits for customers did not appear in the form of strong investment in, say, slick technology to make banking easier. Instead, we had disgraces such as the gouging of customers with payment protection insurance. What should be done? If a full competition inquiry follows, the CMA could suggest three broad areas of remedies. There are problems with them all. The radical route would be a break-up of the big beasts. For example: let Halifax escape from Lloyds, remove NatWest from Royal Bank of Scotland, and make Barclays reincarnate the Woolwich on the high street. But the costs, which would inevitably rebound on customers, might be hellish. On one tally, Lloyds spent \u00a31.3bn separating TSB. Nor would the exercise be quick. It is taking RBS about half a decade to shed just 314 branches under the Williams &amp; Glyn badge. A second option would be to abolish free in-credit personal banking. The theory here is that current accounts aren't really free because savers pay in the form of lower interest rates and others pay via high overdraft charges and the like. If true costs were forced into the open by making customers pay upfront for personal accounts, perhaps punters would be more inclined to shop around. Price, after all, is what drives behaviour in other markets, as Aldi and Lidl are demonstrating to the other \"big four\", the supermarkets. The CMA will look at the idea. It says the free-if-in-credit model \"may distort competition\". But would a government of any stripe ever declare that everyone should pay \u00a3100-plus a year for a bank account? Whatever the economic models say, the policy doesn't sound like a vote-winner. The third route is more of the same. That is, more regulatory tickling from the wings: lower capital requirements for new entrants; firmer policing of the intra-bank payments system, the source of too many grumbles from small banks; and greater transparency on lending rates in the small business market, aided by enforced sharing of firms' credit histories. The objection here is timidity. Over a decade, those sky-high market shares might be trimmed by only the odd percentage point. Which way should the CMA jump? After umpteen banking reviews, let's see the big options explored. That Lloyds/HBOS merger still looks a gross error, so let's have a proper analysis of the cost of breaking up; ditto RBS. If the CMA feels that killing \"free\" banking would help, it should make the argument whatever the political headaches. Yet more tweaks and tickles would be an admission of regulatory impotence \u2013 depressingly, that outcome is probably the way to bet. Shire's shares in the spotlight Shire has negotiated decent terms to be taken over by AbbVie. A price of \u00a331bn \u2013 \u00a352.48 per share \u2013 didn't meet the market's initial high hopes but it's a long way above the \u00a321.50 at which Shire traded a year ago. For good measure, AbbVie will have to cough up \u00a3930m if it walks away because US politicians quash the tax \"inversion\" lark. So it would be unfair to accuse Shire chief executive Flemming Ornskov of selling his shareholders short because he himself stands to collect $9.9m (\u00a35.8m) in cash just to hang around at New AbbVie for a year. All the same, why does he need a retention payment? If Shire was being bought wholly for cash, one could understand AbbVie's thinking: Ornskov's long-term share-based incentives would mature instantly and he might walk away. But this is a cash-and-shares deal billed as \"a merger\". Surely his share-based incentives should just roll into New AbbVie's stock at the merger terms. Then he would have plenty of motivation to stay to make the combo a success. AbbVie's and Shire's joint statement said \"appropriate proposals\" would be put to participants in Shire's share schemes \"in due course\". What does that mean? Will the rollover principle be obeyed or not? If Ornskov and senior colleagues will be cashed-up in full on their long-term incentives, and then paid handsome retention awards on top, they will be collecting twice. That would be a bad precedent, even if the deal itself is good for Shire shareholders. Before New AbbVie starts its strange life as Chicago-headquartered, Jersey-incorporated, UK-domiciled company, it should clear up this point. As for the tax \"inversion,\" US politicians should get their skates on if they want to stop the flow of deals. Jacob Lew, US Treasury secretary, this week accused AbbVie of being \"economically unpatriotic.\" But the company is definitely being economically literate. New AbbVie says it expects to pay an effective tax rate of just 13%. Other US companies will like the look of that. The Murdochs: Time Warner's new drama Would Time Warner be the crowning achievement of Rupert Murdoch's deal-making career? Actually, his greatest feat has been maintaining the family's iron control of the empire via voting arrangements that are patently unfair, at least to British eyes. At 21st Century Fox, the Murdoch family owns about 13% of the company but has almost 40% of the votes thanks to a type of dual share structure that went out of fashion at UK companies about 20 years ago when institutional investors demanded an equal voice for equal risk.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is to build 4,000 new homes in an attempt to make use of its vast undeveloped landbank with a \u00a31bn construction programme. The plan, announced weeks after the Guardian revealed that Tesco is hoarding land that could support 15,000 homes, is the biggest housebuilding project ever announced by the supermarket. A Guardian investigation of Land Registry records found that the retailer was sitting on 310 sites that do not currently house a Tesco store. Among the Tesco sites set for housing developments following Friday's announcement will be Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, close to the retailer's operational headquarters, where it plans to build more than 700 homes on a site where it previously planned a store. The trade journal Property Week said the majority of the sites will be in the south-east of England but developments are also scheduled further north, including in Liverpool and the west of England. Schemes include 80 houses and flats on the former Evershed printing works site in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Tesco said it was likely to build homes itself via its development wing, Spenhill, while also selling sites to housing developers, in a programme that has been valued by Property Week at \u00a31bn, based on a valuation of \u00a3250,000 per home. A Tesco spokesperson said: \"In response to changing customer shopping habits we have decided to reduce the amount of new store space we build each year, building fewer large stores. Where we no longer intend to develop sites, we sell them, lease them or develop them for housing. \"We are pleased to be bringing new investment to communities up and down the country and playing our part in meeting local housing needs over the coming years.\" Last April Tesco boss Philip Clarke cut the value of about 460,000 sq m of its land by \u00a3800m as he admitted the company would have to sell off land where it had previously planned to build stores, store extensions and distribution centres. However, the company has been slow to act as the most ready buyers for much of its land stock are likely to have been rivals such as the fast-growing Aldi and Lidl chains. Retail analysts said Tesco was now turning to housing developments because residential development was more economically viable. The poor performance of out-of-town supermarkets meant the land was not necessarily worth more if it was dedicated to new retail sites. Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital, said Tesco was under pressure to act due to public and political demand for space to build housing, alongside calls from shareholders to recoup some of the value of the land. \"This is a silver lining on a very dark cloud,\" said Black. \"Tesco is at least trying to maximise value after a high-profile profits writedown but it's not clear how much it will be able to claw back. It's a sensible move and better than building a Tesco store that's not economic or selling to the competition.\" Tesco already has a policy of building homes above or beside its stores as part of efforts to gain planning permission. In London alone, Tesco was set to build more than 800 homes last year, close to 5% of all non-local authority homes being built in the capital. That included projects in Woolwich, Highams Green and Streatham, where Tesco built a total of 450 homes. Other supermarkets are also developing housing, with at least 4,500 homes expected to be built by the major grocers between 2013 and 2018. J Sainsbury was set to begin projects involving more than 1,500 homes this year, including a partnership with Barratt on a major development in Battersea, south London, which includes 700 homes and a new tube station. Some developments are smaller in scale. Waitrose has developed a number of stores topped by flats, while many retailers are turning redundant pubs into convenience stores with housing above.",

The deal marks a big expansion for London-based Bestway, which was founded by Conservative party donor Sir Anwar Pervez with one store in Earl's Court in 1963. The Pakistani-born entrepreneur now presides over an empire that includes 64 wholesale warehouses and a network of more than 4,000 independently owned convenience stores under the Best-one and Xtra Local brands. It also owns Pakistan's second largest cement manufacturer and second largest private bank, as well as 64 UK wholesale warehouses supplying small local shops. Zameer Choudrey, Bestway's chief executive, said the acquisition of Britain's third largest pharmacy chain would marry the company's expertise in convenience retailing with a steadily growing new market. It wants to double the size of the 770-store pharmacy business over the next 10 years. \"The attraction is primarily demographics \u2013 with everybody living longer, there will be more need for medicines,\" he said. \"Like convenience retail, the pharmacy sector is very fragmented; 45% are independents, and that leaves a lot of room for us to grow, not just organically but also via acquisition.\" No job losses are expected as a result of the deal and Choudrey said Bestway would be seeking a new headquarters for the pharmacy business close to the Co-op's headquarters in Manchester. The company has a year to find new premises as part of a support package in which the Co-op brand will stay above the pharmacy doors for 12 months. Bestway, which achieved turnover of \u00a32.5bn and underlying profits of \u00a3220m last year, said the acquisition would help build the UK side of its business to bring it in balance with the Pakistani operations, which contribute more than 60% of profits. Now Britain's seventh-largest family-run business, Bestway is co-owned by five families led by Pervez. The family of his nephew, Choudrey, also owns a stake, as do the families of Younus Sheikh, who is managing director of the UK wholesale business, and the Bhatti and Chaudhary families, who are longstanding friends of Pervez's. The deal is a boost for the Co-op, which is restructuring in the wake of a crisis at its banking division which left it with a \u00a31.9bn capital shortfall. The company now has debts of \u00a31.4bn and the majority of the proceeds of the pharmacy sell-off are set to go towards paying that off. The Co-op's interim chief executive, Richard Pennycook, said the deal will enable the Co-op to invest in its remaining retail, funeral and banking businesses. \"Bestway is acquiring an excellent pharmacy business characterised by the quality and professionalism of its colleagues and high levels of customer service. \"Bestway in return is an ideal owner, being a strong, family-run group with a proven record of putting the needs of customers first.\" Choudrey said that Bestway's charitable division, which supports educational projects in Britain and Pakistan and is funded by an annual contribution equivalent to 2.5% of the group's profits, had helped persuade the Co-op to choose the company as the winning bidder.",

This has now been achieved.

      "bodyText": "That's it for today, folks. We are wrapping things up and heading out into the sun. Thanks for all your comments, and have a great weekend. We'll be back next week. Returning to the CMA's inquiy into banking, the Treasury Committee will be taking evidence from the new competition watchdog on Monday. Andrew Tyrie MP, chairman of the Treasury Committee, said: Millions of consumers and small businesses have been denied genuine choice in banking for years. The Treasury Committee, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and the Independent Commission on Banking examined this issue in depth. Everyone concluded much the same: customers do not know how much they are being charged, switching is perceived to be difficult, and would-be competitors in the market face high barriers to entry, often regulatory. Among other things, in 2011 the Treasury Committee concluded that the regulators should have statutory responsibility for improving competition and choice. This has now been achieved. But it was not enough. Over a year ago, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards recommended that a market study of both the retail and SME banking sectors begin immediately, recognising that a full market investigation may be necessary. So the CMA\u2019s announcement is an encouraging step forward. Many previous attempts to reshape banking and provide meaningful competition have faltered in the past. This work is the biggest opportunity for years of better meeting the needs of consumers and SMEs. Wall Street has opened slightly higher. The Dow has gained 0.3% to 17023.79, the Nasdaq has risen 0.6% to 4389.64 and the S&amp;P 500 is 0.4% ahead at 1966.67. Explaining the Shire takeover to analysts on a conference call, AbbVie boss, Rick Gonzalez, says it's not all about tax, although tax is \"clearly a benefit\". He insists that the Shire deal has compelling financial and strategic attractions beyond tax. But he doesn't seem to have convinced the analysts or his shareholders. It is the biggest tax inversion deal to date. Here in London, the FTSE 100 has recovered somewhat and is now down 0.2%, or 10.6 points, at 6727.83 points (it fell 0.6% earlier). Housebuilders Barratt and Persimmon were among the biggest fallers after brokerage Liberum downgraded its rating on Barratt to \"hold\" from \"buy\". Shire remains the biggest riser, up 2.7% to \u00a349.35, after it agreed to be taken over by US rival AbbVie in a \u00a332bn deal. Here's the full story. The FTSE 100 Volatility Index climbed 5.4%, reflecting investors' nervousness over the crises in Ukraine and Gaza. Follow the latest developments in Ukraine on a separate live blog here. The Bank of Italy has cut its growth forecast for this year to 0.2% from 0.7% with \"risks to the downside\". It is predicting a recovery to 1.3% growth next year. Oil has pushed above $108 a barrel as tensions rose in Gaza, where Israeli troops are advancing, and Ukraine, following the airline crash. Brent climbed 29 cents to $108.18 a barrel while New York crude was up 17 cents at $103.36 a barrel. The AbbVie-Shire deal in a nutshell: Time for a look at the markets. The Russian rouble-denominated Micex dropped 1.9% in the first minute of trading, and is now down 1.6%. In London, the FTSE 100 index has lost 0.4%, the Dax in Frankfurt has slid 0.7% and the CAC in Paris is trading 0.25% lower. The rouble, which hit a six-week low against the dollar yesterday, is down 0.27% at 35.08 today. Earlier today, RBS boss Ross McEwan admitted that the investigation into alleged manipulation of foreign exchange markets could pose a bigger problem for banks than the Libor interest rate rigging scandal. Here are the full comments. We're still doing a lot of investigation. We're going through just millions and millions of emails, chatrooms, conversations to see what actually went wrong, if anything, in this area. Unfortunately, I have the feeling that this is a sort of Libor case again. The difference this time is that we haven't sat back and denied it. We've gone into it and are doing the investigation hand in hand with the authorities. RBS paid $612m last year to settle allegations that it manipulated Libor rates, one of several banks that received big fines. Regulators are now investigating claims that traders manipulated key reference rates in the $5 trillion a day foreign exchange market. More detail on what Shire would get if the deal fell apart. As reported earlier, it would pocket a \u00a3960m break fee. Alternatively, AbbVie agreed to pay Shire \"at least\" $500m to reimburse it for its costs should the deal fall apart. Here's some analyst reaction to the AbbVie-Shire deal: Mick Cooper, analyst at Edison Investment Research, says: This is a positive outcome for both sets of shareholders and it is pleasing to see that personal egos have not interfered with the commercial rationale. Shire has just put out a trading statement, trumpeting record quarterly revenues of $1.5bn for the three months to 30 June, its second quarter \u2013 a 20% rise. Within that, product sales are up 22%. Operating income is up 32% to $630m. It expects product sales growth in the high teens for the full year and raised its earnings guidance to low-to-mid 30% growth, from mid-to-high 20% growth. Meanwhile, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee has written to business secretary Vince Cable asking him for further details on plans to strengthen the public interest test to protect British firms from foreign takeover bids. Cable has also threatened foreign firms that break commitments on jobs and investment once they've taken over British businesses with multimillion-pound penalties. The move comes after Pfizer's (failed) \u00a369.4bn takeover proposal for AstraZeneca in May triggered widespread fears that the US company would break any pledges made on jobs, given its track record. Lord Hollick, chairman of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, said: In our evidence session with Vince Cable he was reluctant to suggest that the existing public interest test could be strengthened in any meaningful way. However, since then he has indicated in the media that the government\u2019s powers to intervene in takeovers could be extended. We have written to Vince Cable to ask him to clarify his position on this issue and very much hope he is now in a position to explain to the committee what he and the government can do to offer important UK companies appropriate protection from foreign takeovers. You can read the letter in full here. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, is speaking in Paris. My colleague Angela Monaghan reports that her theme, at the Robert Schuman Foundation, is \u201csupporting the European recovery in a rapidly changing world\u201d. The territory is familiar: \"There is the danger of a vicious cycle: persistently high unemployment and high debt-to-GDP ratios jeopardize investement and lower future growth,\" she says. Lagarde reiterates Mario Draghi\u2019s point that there is \u201cmore to do\u201d on structural reforms in various economies, which if achieved could add as much as 3.5% to the currency bloc\u2019s GDP by 2019. She also reminds us of the key recommendations the IMF has made to eurozone policymakers: - Monetary policy should remain loose until demand has fully recovered and inflation rises back to the European Central Bank\u2019s target of close to 2% - Economies with the fiscal room to engage in more public investment should do so - Balance sheets must be repaired to help improve confidence - Banks should take advantage of more benign market conditions to raise more capital - Establish a banking union. A common fiscal backstop is still needed to break the link between banks and sovereigns As ever, Lagarde tells us of the need for deeper economic integration in the eurozone but admits the answers remain elusive. In particular, she stresses the need to maintain an educated labour force that is mobile across borders - \u201cthe euro area cannot afford to let its talent go to waste.\u201d From this perspective, the fact that youth unemployment is so high - an average of 24% across the region - is nothing short of a catastrophe. Its own survival requires that Europe gets the young back to work ... the needs are here and solutions remain to be found. She concludes: I think I have pointed out enough areas where concrete achievements are needed and certainly possible. I have perhaps raised more questions than provided answers, but I know that to find the solutions to these critical challenges, a dialogue such as we have today is a key step on the right path. Shire chief executive Flemming Ornskov will stay on to lead the integration on behalf of Shire and oversee the creation of a rare disease unit within the new company, reporting directly to AbbVie boss Rick Gonzalez. He will be based in Switzerland. He stands to get a retention payment of $9.9m (\u00a35.8m), equivalent to 105% of its annual pay package. 30 other senior Shire employees will get combined retention payments of $22.9m if they stay on. Ornskov, who took the helm at Shire in January 2013, holds 22,000 Shire shares and if all his long-term incentive awards pay out, he could land a windfall of up to \u00a321m. His predecessor, Angus Russell, owns shares worth \u00a321m in the company, while the former finance director, Graham Hetherington, who left in March, could pocket nearly \u00a330m from his shareholdings and long-term awards. Shire chair Susan Kilsby and Dominic Blakemore, a non-executive director, are to join the board of the combined company, which will be headquartered in Chicago. The takeover hasn't caused the same controversy as Pfizer's abortive \u00a369bn bid for AstraZeneca, Britain's second-largest drugmaker, in May, because Shire only employs about 500 people in the UK, mostly in sales and marketing. The majority of its research is done in the US. Shire is best known for its hyperactivity drugs for children, but nearly all its early research is now focused on rare diseases. AbbVie makes the world's top-selling medicine, Humira, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. Shire is once again the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, following its agreed deal with AbbVie. The shares are up 90p, or 1.9%, to \u00a349. The AbbVie-Shire deal is not a huge surprise, as the Shire board decided to back it on Monday. AbbVie will pay \u00a324.44 in cash and 0.8960 shares for each Shire share \u2013 the same terms as the ones it set out at the start of the week. This values Shire at \u00a353.19 a share. Shire shareholders will own 25% of the combined company. The main sticking point appears to have been a break fee for Shire, should the deal fall apart. Its tax structure is controversial, amid growing noises from the US about a clampdown on \"tax inversions\". The break fee is 3% of the value of the deal, i.e. about \u00a3960m. AbbVie plans to create a combined company incorporated in Jersey, the Channel Islands, which will pay an effective tax of 13%, sharply lower than its current rate of 22%, making the deal one of the biggest driven tax inversion. Breaking news: Chicago-based AbbVie agrees \u00a332bn takeover of British pharmaceutical firm Shire. Coming up: Christine Lagarde is speaking at the Robert Schuman Foundation in Paris at 10am BST (9am GMT). Ferrari asks about the CMA investigation into banking. McEwan replies: It'll be good to have the inquiry. I welcome it, let's get on with it. It's taking the uncertainty out of the marketplace. This concludes the phone-in. McEwan will be back on LBC in the New Year. and the economy? McEwan says: It's starting to improve, it's actually quite good. It's starting to get out of the main London centre and starting to spread out. He pays tribute to his predecessor Stephen Hester, saying he did an \"amazing job\" restructuring the business, at a time of great chaos. On to the Scottish independence referendum. The decision is up to the Scottish, McEwan says. I have a personal view that I'm not putting on radio. It's up to the Scots and 'I'm not a Scotsman. [He's a Kiwi.] We are having to do some contingency planning as any good business would do. After an ad break, more questions for RBS head Ross McEwan on the Nick Ferrari show on LBC radio. He says: For about 10 to 15 years the banks in general didn't put the customer the one thing that they focused on. They put a lot of other things, in particular growth and expansion offshore, first. That was a focus on revenue, not the customer. We are doing a lot of change in our business right now. He defends the bank's job cuts (are there more to come? The bank already hinted at this at its annual meeting when its chairman, Sir Philip Hampton, warned of further branch closures as the popularity of online and mobile banking grows): I've got too many staff and I've been quite open and honest about that. We need to go through change. McEwan wants to \"get back to good banking the way it used to be 20 odd years ago.\" He keeps saying: \"we need a better bank\". McEwan admits RBS still has a lot of work to do. There are a number of litigation and conduct issues that we are still grappling with. They will come out over the next 18 months, he says. Asked about bonuses, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan says he supports the idea of an incentive payment where people are providing a good service. RBS boss Ross McEwan is taking questions on LBC radio now. You can watch here. This is how LBC introduces the phone-in on its website: \"In 2008, they were the most controversial bank in the country, bailed out by the government, to the tune of \u00a346bn and embroiled in controversy over bankers bonuses. But now, they well on the way to recovery under the stewardship of a new captain who is determined to earn back your trust.\" The CMA investigation was welcomed by consumer and business organisations, while banking shares fell on the news. Charlotte Webster, campaign manager at Move Your Money, said: We welcome the CMA's decision to investigate the banking market. We've been saying this for years. Simply, people want real alternatives. This is something the big banks would have you believe don't exist, but they do. Whilst millions have switched banks in the last year, there are many parallels between energy and banking. The inquiry will also help tackle business banking concerns, says the British Chambers of Commerce. John Longworth, BCC director general, said: Businesses want more competition, choice and transparency in the banking sector, so the provisional decision by regulators to conduct a full-scale investigation into business banking is the right one. The planned CMA investigation must be wide-ranging if it is to make a real difference to the growth prospects of small and medium sized firms. In addition to competition questions around everyday business banking, we are pleased regulators will also be looking closely at SME loans. When it comes to access to finance, the current market isn't working for many young and dynamic firms. Without better access to working capital, including bank loans, Britain's future business champions will have a hard time expanding and taking their goods and services to the world. This investigation should be used as an opportunity to tackle the many concerns businesses have raised around banking and growth finance. Customer service, switching, lending and other business banking services must be examined together, to ensure that the practical issues facing businesses are addressed head on. Here's some reaction to the CMA's investigation into the \u00a310bn banking sector. Ed Balls MP, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: Ed Miliband and I have repeatedly called for an inquiry into bank competition, so it\u2019s welcome that the Competition and Markets Authority is now set to start this work later this year. Ministers claim there is no problem to solve, but everyone else recognises that we have a lack of competition in our banking sector. As we said earlier this year, in the next parliament we need to see at least two new challenger banks and a market share test to ensure the market stays competitive for the long term. Shares in Shire are the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index, opening 1.4% higher. We are still waiting for a statement from AbbVie. The Chicago-based drugmaker has to table a firm offer by 5pm or walk away for 6 months. Both sides have agreed on price (Shire said on Monday it would recommend AbbVie's latest cash-and-shares proposal of \u00a331bn to its shareholders), but have spent all week haggling over the other terms. Shire is thought to be pushing for a hefty break fee in case the deal falls apart over tax. AbbVie wants to relocate to the UK to cut its tax bill, but the US government has become more vocal on \"tax inversions\". This week the US Treasury Secretary, Jacob Lew, urged Congress to act urgently to clamp down on this \"abuse\" of the American tax system. In other corporate news, the embattled Co-operative Group has sold its pharmacy business to Bestway Group for \u00a3620m. The money will be used to pay down its crippling debts and invest in its core businesses. Aer Lingus boss Christoph Mueller is set to step down next May. During his five years at the helm, he returned the Irish carrier to profit and resisting a third takeover attempt by larger rival Ryanair. A former aviation director at TUI Travel, the German took over the then lossmaking former state airline in October 2009 and slashed costs in response to a slump in passenger numbers during Ireland's financial crisis. Pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca will unveil the design plans for its new hub in Cambridge today, which formed a key plank in its defence strategy against Pfizer's unwelcome takeover bid in May. Let's turn to today's corporate news. The Competition Markets Authority, the new competition watchdog, has set out its proposals for a sweeping investigation into Britain's major banks, which is set to take 18 months. Britain's big four high street banks could be forced to break themselves up, our banking correspondent Jill Treanor reports. The big four \u2013 the two bailed out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, along with HSBC and Barclays, control 77% of current accounts and 85% of small business current accounts. The CMA, launched in April to replace other competition watchdogs, has launched a consultation until mid September on its provisional conclusion that both small business customers and personal current account customers do not have good service from their banks. \u201cCompetitive personal and SME banking markets are essential to households and businesses throughout the country, and to the success of the UK economy. However, our studies have found that despite some positive developments, significant competition concerns remain which mean that customers may not be getting consistently good service and value from their banks,\u201d said Alex Chisholm, chief executive of the CMA. The main economic release of the day is the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, which Lawler of CMC Markets UK expects to improve slightly over last month to 83.5. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: It\u2019s hard to see what separatists looking for a more independent eastern Ukraine would have to gain from killing innocent civilians on an aeroplane from Amsterdam. At this point all possibilities are open; it is already a tragedy but the best one can hope for is that the incident was not a terrorist act or even a false-flag operation and simply a mechanical or pilot error. Once the aeroplane\u2019s black box has been examined and investigators have inspected the wreckage, if the crash is simply a tragic error, stock markets could easily snap back higher with a renewed focus on economic and earnings news. Should it be determined to have been a deliberate attack, the question would then turn who was responsible. Whether it had a direct hand in the attack or not; Russia is currently being sanctioned for its support of the separatists, so if the rebels committed the atrocity, the United States and Europe will consider Russia ultimately responsible. The consequences of a US military response against Russia don\u2019t bear thinking about. If the tragic loss of life in Ukraine was not enough, Israel has escalated the conflict with the Hamas government in Gaza by ordering a ground offensive. The FTSE 100 index in London has opened 0.5% lower, falling more than 30 points to 6706.55 in the first five minutes of trading. France's CAC is down 0.4%, Spain's Ibex has lost 0.6% and Italy's FTSE MiB has dropped 0.5%. Markets are also unsettled by Israel's assault on Gaza, after last-ditch efforts to secure a ceasefire in Cairo collapsed. More here. Oil prices are heading for their first weekly gain in four weeks after the Malaysia Airlines crash in eastern Ukraine. Oil on both sides of the Atlantic jumped 2% on the news yesterday. This morning, Brent crude is up 56 cents, or 0.5%, at $108.45 a barrel after rising 72 cents yesterday. US crude has risen 60 cents to $103.79, a 0.6% gain, after closing $1.99 higher. Both benchmarks are on track for the first weekly rise in four weeks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. The Malaysia Airlines crash in war-torn eastern Ukraine has hit stock markets around the world. The Russian stock market, Micex, opened 1.9% lower, extending losses from yesterday after the missile attack on the civilian airliner. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 posted its biggest one-day fall in three months last night, closing down 1.18%. The Nasdaq fell 1.41% and the Dow lost 0.94%. At the same time, the CBOE Volatility index jumped 32.2%, its biggest daily percentage gain since April 2013. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei lost 1.1%. Both Russia and Ukraine denied involvement in the crash, which came a day after the US ramped up sanctions against Moscow for supporting Ukrainian separatists. The president of Ukraine accused pro-Russia rebels in the east of the country of shooting down the Malaysia Airlines jet. All 283 passengers and 15 crew were killed. Hillary Clinton, the former US secretary of state, also pointed the finger at Russian-backed rebels and declared that Russian president Vladimir Putin \"has gone too far\". More here. US president Barack Obama stopped short of directly blaming pro-Russia rebels for the missile attack.",

      "bodyText": "Shire executives will receive multimillion-pound payouts after the British pharmaceutical company finally agreed to a \u00a332bn ($54.7bn) takeover by the US drugs company AbbVie, following an intense set of negotiations. Shire's insistence on holding out for a big-break fee paid off on Friday, with AbbVie agreeing to hand over 3% of the value of the deal \u2013 \u00a3960m \u2013 if it walks away. Alternatively, AbbVie has agreed to pay Shire at least $500m (\u00a3293m) in compensation for costs, losses and expenses related to the deal if AbbVie shareholders vote against it. The US company has agreed to incentivise 31 senior members of Shire's staff to stay on after the deal, in a package totalling \u00a319.2m. A retention payment of \u00a35.8m will be handed to Flemming Ornskov, Shire's chief executive, who will lead the integration on the Shire side and oversee the creation of a new rare-disease business unit within the combined company. Ornskov's retention fee is equivalent to around 150% of his annual salary. The remaining \u00a322.9m will be shared between 30 members of Shire staff considered to be key to the future of the combined company. Those employees will be entitled to a cash payment worth 100 \u2013 200% of annual salary and bonus on 30 June 2015. Ornskov, who took the reins in January 2013, could land an additional windfall of up to \u00a321m if all his long-term incentive schemes pay out. His predecessor, Angus Russell, owns shares worth \u00a321m in the company, while the former finance director, Graham Hetherington, who left in March, could pocket nearly \u00a330m from his shareholdings and long-term awards. Shire was the biggest FTSE 100 riser on Friday afternoon, up 1.6% at \u00a348.85. The combined companies will have a workforce of 30,000 and a market value of $137bn. Both companies insisted there was little overlap between the two. AbbVie makes the world's bestselling drug, Humira, for rheumatoid arthritis, and Shire is best known for its rare diseases expertise and treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Richard Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive of AbbVie, wrote an open letter to staff detailing the takeover. He said: \"The proposed transaction would create a well-positioned and focused biopharmaceutical company, giving us the opportunity to expand and augment our product portfolio, advance our pipeline, accelerate our growth, and create long-term value for our shareholders. \"The companies have complementary strategies, both focused on creating leadership positions within areas of high unmet medical need. Both businesses have complementary areas of strength, rather than overlap. Shire would add new growth platforms in neuroscience and rare diseases.\" The deal would allow Chicago-based AbbVie to diversify its product range and lower its tax bill. AbbVie wants to shift its tax base from the US to Britain as part of the deal, a move that would cut its corporation tax rate from 22% to 13% by 2016. The drugs firm is one of a string of US companies looking to redomicile abroad to save billions on tax, most notably Pfizer, whose failed \u00a369bn attempt to buy Britain's AstraZeneca in May was partly motivated by the tax savings it could make. Jacob Lew, the US treasury secretary, has urged the leaders of the congressional tax-writing committees to act now to stop US firms relocating for tax purposes. Despite the controversy in the US, the deal is unlikely to trigger the public and political opposition created in the UK by Pfizer's pursuit of AstraZeneca because Shire is largely based in the US. It was was founded in the UK but is managed in Boston, headquartered in Dublin and generates most of its sales in the US. It employs fewer than 500 people in the UK \u2013 out of a 5,000-strong workforce \u2013 and has a small research and development unit in Britain. The deal is not expected to generate big job losses, because of the lack of overlap between the two businesses. The deal values Shire shares at \u00a353.19, a 53% premium to the closing price on 2 May \u2013 the last trading day before AbbVie's initial proposal. Agreement on the deal was reached before the 5pm deadline on Friday, and followed intense negotiations between the two companies during the week. Shire achieved the protective clauses after fears the deal could fall apart because of the political sensitivity in the US surrounding AbbVie's desire to achieve a tax advantage through the deal.",

    "webTitle": "Banking sector faces wide-ranging review by finance watchdog", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain's big four high street banks could be forced to break up after the competition watchdog signalled its intention to launch a sweeping investigation into the UK's \u00a310bn-a-year banking business. Setting out its proposals for an 18-month inquiry, the new Competition and Markets Authority has gone further than its predecessors, who said they would wait until 2015 before considering such a move. The big four \u2013 the two bailed-out banks, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, along with HSBC and Barclays \u2013 control 77% of current accounts and 85% of small business accounts. These market shares are little changed despite 10 investigations in the last 15 years. The CMA, created in April to replace other competition watchdogs, will consult until mid-September on its provisional conclusion that both small business and personal current account customers get a poor service from their banks and cannot tell the difference between products provided by the main players. The watchdog will be looking at the impact of free in-credit banking, which could be cross-subsidising the industry, as some banks insist that running current accounts loses them money. The banks generate \u00a38bn a year in revenue from current accounts and \u00a32bn from small business accounts, and there are fears that the investigation will conclude with new charges for accounts. Alex Chisholm, chief executive of the CMA, said: \"Competitive personal and SME banking markets are essential to households and businesses throughout the country, and to the success of the UK economy. However, our studies have found that, despite some positive developments, significant competition concerns remain which mean that customers may not be getting consistently good service and value from their banks.\" Chisholm has been called before the Treasury select committee on Monday to discuss the inquiry. Bank shares slipped back on a stock market more concerned by wider geopolitical concerns. The investigation comes at a time when political scrutiny of the sector is intensifying. The inquiry will run beyond the May 2015 election. Ed Miliband had pledged to launch a competition investigation, and shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \"In the next parliament we need to see at least two new challenger banks and a market-share test to ensure the market stays competitive for the long term.\" The CMA could adopt structural remedies, such as forcing banks to carve new banks out of their existing networks, or it could recommend behavioural remedies \u2013 forcing them to become more transparent with charges or to send text alerts to customers when they go overdrawn. As it is, Lloyds and RBS are already being forced to reshape their branch networks as a result of the state-aid terms imposed by the EU during their bailouts. Lloyds has created a new TSB bank on the high street, which is the process of being floated on the stock market, while RBS must break out 314 branches as a new bank aimed at small business customers. The two state-owned banks have the largest market shares, partly because the banking crisis led to a wave of takeovers with names such as Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley disappearing from the high street and \"challenger bank\" HBOS being rescued by Lloyds. Chisholm said structural remedies were costly \u2013 creating TSB has cost \u00a31.3bn \u2013 but should nevertheless be considered. David Mann, head of money at uSwitch.com, welcomed the proposed inquiry. He said: \"This is potentially great news for anyone who has a bank account. The CMA has the clout to fix the broken banking industry once and for all, and lay the foundations for a competitive market that works for, rather than against, customers.\" Stephen Ibbotson of the Institute of Chartered Accountants England and Wales also welcomed a full investigation: \"It is right that the CMA is conducting a full-scale investigation into the business lending sector,\" he said. \"If the economic recovery is to be sustainable, fast-growing firms need access to finance to push them to the next level and enable them to expand further.\" But he warned: \"It is crucial that this inquiry does not over-complicate the market.\" The coalition has already embarked on a series of attempts to bolster competition, including making it easier for new banks to be set up. And the banks had hoped that a new seven-day switching service for current counts would stall any competition investigation. A Treasury spokesman said the government supported an inquiry, even though it comes as George Osborne prepares to ask the public to buy shares in Lloyds, where the taxpayer still has a 24% stake. It is not clear what impact this might have on the sale of Lloyds, or of RBS, in which the government owns an 80% stake. The industry has been aware of the threat of a competition investigation since the 2011 report by Sir John Vickers, and last month attempted to head off a full-blown investigation by proposing a number of \"remedies\" to the CMA. The watchdog has rejected these ideas, which include setting up a comparison website, establishing new account opening standards, and making it easier to compare accounts. Chisholm said the two-month consultation would be an opportunity for these proposals to be reconsidered. But few expect the industry to be successful in seeing off a full-blown investigation after the CMA found that customer satisfaction levels for the big four banks are at 60%. Even after a new switching service were launched, only 3% of personal account customers and 4% of small business customers switch every year.

      "body": "<p>Britain's big four high street banks could be forced to break up after the competition watchdog signalled its intention to launch a sweeping investigation into the UK's \u00a310bn-a-year banking business.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/personal-current-accounts-and-small-business-banking-not-working-well-for-customers\" title=\"\">Setting out its proposals for an 18-month inquiry</a>, the new Competition and Markets Authority has gone further than its predecessors, who said they would wait until 2015 before considering such a move.</p> <p>The big four \u2013 the two bailed-out banks, Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, along with HSBC and Barclays \u2013 control 77% of current accounts and 85% of small business accounts. These market shares are little changed despite 10 investigations in the last 15 years.</p> <p>The CMA, created in April to replace other competition watchdogs, will consult until mid-September on its provisional conclusion that both small business and personal current account customers get a poor service from their banks and cannot tell the difference between products provided by the main players.</p> <p>The watchdog will be looking at the impact of free in-credit banking, which could be cross-subsidising the industry, as some banks insist that running current accounts loses them money. The banks generate \u00a38bn a year in revenue from current accounts and \u00a32bn from small business accounts, and there are fears that the investigation will conclude with new charges for accounts.</p> <p>Alex Chisholm, chief executive of the CMA, said: \"Competitive personal and SME banking markets are essential to households and businesses throughout the country, and to the success of the UK economy. However, our studies have found that, despite some positive developments, significant competition concerns remain which mean that customers may not be getting consistently good service and value from their banks.\" Chisholm has been called before the Treasury select committee on Monday to discuss the inquiry.</p> <p>Bank shares slipped back on a stock market more concerned by wider geopolitical concerns.</p> <p>The investigation comes at a time when political scrutiny of the sector is intensifying. The inquiry will run beyond the May 2015 election. Ed Miliband had pledged to launch a competition investigation, and shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: \"In the next parliament we need to see at least two new challenger banks and a market-share test to ensure the market stays competitive for the long term.\"</p> <p>The CMA could adopt structural remedies, such as forcing banks to carve new banks out of their existing networks, or it could recommend behavioural remedies \u2013 forcing them to become more transparent with charges or to send text alerts to customers when they go overdrawn.</p> <p>As it is, Lloyds and RBS are already being forced to reshape their branch networks as a result of the state-aid terms imposed by the EU during their bailouts. Lloyds has created a new TSB bank on the high street, which is the process of being floated on the stock market, while RBS must break out 314 branches as a new bank aimed at small business customers.</p> <p>The two state-owned banks have the largest market shares, partly because the banking crisis led to a wave of takeovers with names such as Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bradford &amp; Bingley disappearing from the high street and \"challenger bank\" HBOS being rescued by Lloyds.</p> <p>Chisholm said structural remedies were costly \u2013 creating TSB has cost \u00a31.3bn \u2013 but should nevertheless be considered.</p> <p>David Mann, head of money at uSwitch.com, welcomed the proposed inquiry.
