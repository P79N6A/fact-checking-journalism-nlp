      "bodyText": "Fears of a British exit from the European Union are adding to the list of concerns causing turbulence on global financial markets, the IMF\u2019s managing director Christine Lagarde said on Saturday. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, she called for a swift deal that would ensure the UK could remain in the EU, for the good of the European and world economies. The comments came after a volatile week which saw sharp falls in world markets, triggered in part by concerns over a slowdown in the Chinese economy and uncertainty about the impact of the fall in the price of oil. On Wednesday, the FTSE index fell to its lowest level in more than three years, before recovering some ground later. Lagarde said Europe\u2019s overall economic outlook had improved recently and that she expected global growth this year to be 3.4%, up from 3.1% in 2015. However, she had two big concerns \u2013 a possible British exit from the EU and the threat of a collapse of the Schengen passport-free travel agreement under the weight of refugees. With regard to \u201cBrexit\u201d, she said her worry was \u201cwhether there is a deal to be had between the United Kingdom and other members of the European Union, which we hope very much because it would really be conducive to more stability and more a cohesive economic zone\u201d. She agreed with those warning that the refugee crisis could \u201cmake or break\u201d the EU\u2019s Schengen agreement. Failure to handle the crisis could put the arrangement, seen as an essential element of the single market, at risk. However, Lagarde told a panel in Davos that a proper strategy and policy on how to manage the new pool of labour could add around 0.2 percentage points to growth across the eurozone. Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP and member of the Commons Treasury select committee, says any prolonged global downturn could have a serious impact on the UK economy, and particularly George Osborne\u2019s deficit-cutting strategy. Writing on theguardian.com, Reeves warns that George Osborne\u2019s plan risks being blown off course, raising the possibility of more cuts or tax increases. Citing recent calculations by the Office for Budget Responsibility, Reeves says a failure to rebalance the UK economy has placed it more at risk. \u201cA surplus of more than \u00a35bn would now be needed in the final quarter of this financial year to meet the chancellor\u2019s targets. If that surplus doesn\u2019t materialise, that means even more cuts and tax increases or further drift in the deficit reduction plans - already extended by five years.\u201d She also ridicules Osborne\u2019s claim in his autumn statement in November that the good times were returning. \u201cJust two months ago Osborne used his autumn statement to boast about the \u2018improvement in the public finances\u2019 that allowed him to U-turn on unpopular cuts to tax credits and policing while delivering a plan that would leave Britain \u2018ready for whatever storms lie ahead\u2019. It is extraordinary how quickly those words have come to seem so incredibly complacent.\u201d Osborne, also in Davos, said he was confident of an EU deal. \u201cThere is goodwill out there with the other member states, and the institutions of the European Union. We\u2019ve now got to make it happen,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The smell of fried food wafts from the door of the Docks Cafe, which sits in the shadow of Tata Steel\u2019s sprawling Port Talbot steelworks. It is lunchtime and the place is rammed with hungry, soot-smudged men in blue overalls who huddle around the Formica tables and tuck into the all-day breakfast. Some brave souls tackle the monstrous breakfast roll, which offers five sausages, three rashers of bacon, plus black pudding, egg and beans. Sharon Evans, who runs the cafe, says: \u201cWe are packed for breakfast and packed for lunch. The talk now is all about jobs. We\u2019re worried about our business too. We\u2019ve been going for five years and are doing OK, but we rely on the works.\u201d These are worrying times for Port Talbot\u2019s steelworks. Tata, the Indian conglomerate that acquired Corus in 2007 in a debt-fuelled \u00a36.7bn deal, sent shockwaves around the town when it announced 1,050 job cuts at several UK sites last week. Port Talbot will feel the sharp edge of the axe, with 750 of its 4,000 workers going over the coming months. In addition, from Sunday, Tata is putting an end to the employment of agency staff, which will result in a further 80 to 100 young workers leaving. This steelworks is Britain\u2019s biggest, accounting for about one third of the country\u2019s total annual production: every Heinz food tin sold in the UK, every roof for the Nissan Juke car and every new 1p and 2p coin (plated in copper) is made from Port Talbot steel. Tata has invested \u00a3300m in the plant over the past four years, including \u00a3200m for a new blast furnace. However, it is still losing \u00a31m a day and sources close to Tata reckon it needs a further \u00a3500m \u2013 for new stripping and rolling mills \u2013 to make it viable. One source believes the savage round of cuts will give management a clearer view of whether it is worth pumping in more cash. \u201cThe meltdown in the steel industry is getting worse, not better, and Tata can\u2019t find an easy way to cut its losses,\u201d the source says. \u201cBut even after this restructuring, the problems [in the market] will still be there. It\u2019s the last roll of the dice.\u201d Britain\u2019s once proud steel industry is in danger of being swept away by a tsunami of cheap Chinese product, slowing demand and high energy costs. About half of the 1.6bn tonnes of steel made globally each year comes from China, giving it huge pricing power. In the past 18 months, it has flooded the market with cheap, subsidised steel as its economic growth has slowed. Beijing wants to grab whatever foreign cash it can on global markets by selling its products at a knockdown rate. Consequently, exports of steel from China nearly doubled to 88.6m tonnes in the year to the end of 2014 \u2013 more than the combined annual production of Mexico and Canada. There is evidence that British steel users are being seduced by the cheaper material \u2013 imports of Chinese steel into the UK have quadrupled from 2% to 8% in the past three years. Significantly, the glut of discounted product has virtually halved the steel price in the past 12 months, making it hard for domestic producers to compete. This toxic economic cocktail has sent the British steel industry into a nosedive. Last year, Thai group SSI shut its Redcar plant, with 2,200 jobs lost. Losses at Tata Steel doubled last year to \u00a3768m and the country\u2019s biggest steelmaker has responded by cutting thousands of jobs, shutting sites in Scotland and selling its Scunthorpe mill, which makes steel for the construction and rail industries. David Cameron is under pressure from opposition MPs to crack down on what they say is Chinese dumping. Ministers argue they are bound by EU trade rules that prevent interference. But any hopes that Brussels can act are fast evaporating. Beijing could actually tighten its grip on the steel market if, as expected, China is granted market economy status by the EU from December 2016. Beijing says this is its right after 15 years as a member of the World Trade Organisation. Market economy status would make it harder for Europe to impose anti-dumping duties on cheap Chinese goods. Axel Eggert, director general of EU steel industry body Eurofer, warns that this will threaten nearly all the 330,000 jobs in Europe\u2019s steel industry. \u201cWe do not see any way to maintain a similar level of trade defence measures if China is granted market economy status. Most of the EU steel industry may disappear,\u201d he says. Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP for Aberavon, says: \u201cThere is a sense that this government seems more interested in cosying up to Beijing than saving British jobs. The British government is now cheerleading for the Chinese to get market economy status. It just beggars belief.\u201d In Port Talbot, there is palpable anger at the government for not doing more. Dave Bowyer, a 40-year veteran of the plant and member of trade union Unite\u2019s executive council, said: \u201cCentral government \u2026 has been very weak. They don\u2019t seem to understand that if you lose your manufacturing base you become a third-class country.\u201d The economic significance of steel to the town is clear, but the effect stretches way beyond Port Talbot. A study by Cardiff University\u2019s Welsh economy research unit found that Tata Steel supports more than 18,000 jobs in Wales and estimates it is worth around \u00a33.2bn to the Welsh economy. The decline of the steelworks has been reflected in Port Talbot. Station Road, once its bustling commercial hub, is now stuffed with betting shops, payday loan stores and charity outlets. The town and the steelworks are long past their 1960s and 1970s peak, when there were 20,000 working at the mill. Michael Cosker, 63, president of the chamber of commerce and owner of the Rolls Choice cafe in the Aberafan shopping centre, still calls it the Abbey Works or simply \u201cthe steel company\u201d. Few here call it Tata. He is old enough to remember the halcyon days. He recalls how, at the end of shifts, the bar staff at Taibach rugby club would line up half-filled pints of bitter in readiness. \u201cThere were 30 pints on the bar ready to be filled and drunk. This was when 20,000-plus were working there. That\u2019s all gone,\u201d he says. While some remember the past, others can\u2019t bear to think about the future. Sue (not her real name), says her husband is approaching his 40th year at the works. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear there at the moment,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a mortgage and grandchildren that we like to help. My husband\u2019s not far short of 60. I don\u2019t know what is in store for us. Life\u2019s on hold at the moment. We\u2019ve usually got a holiday booked by now. But we\u2019re waiting to see what will happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s end on a heartwarming tale from Davos. One of the most impressive delegates this year was Mark Pollock, the first blind man to race to the South Pole who was later paralysed. Pollock\u2019s wheelchair just broke, leaving him in a serious jam. But he was rescued by a technician who trudged through the snow to find him, and fix it. And he only charged 20 francs. Quite a bargain, and proof that the world isn\u2019t all bad. Delegates are streaming away from the WEF conference all, with a lot to think about. Philip Jennings, head of the UNI Global Union, says this Davos was about \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d. We started the with Oxfam saying that 62 people are as wealthy as the poorest half of the world, prompting warning about inequality and distribution. We ended it with JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon putting two fingers up to the world, and taking a 30% pay rise. It\u2019s been a funny old Davos this year. The wild swings in the stock markets reminded us that the global economy remains fragile, dominated by emerging market woes and fears of a new global slowdown. But that was trumped by the awful news that at least 45 people drowned yesterday fleeing the Middle East for Europe. The worst January on record for refugee deaths could herald a grim 2016. Davos is nearly over - and delegates are tucking into lunch. It\u2019s quite a menu - including deer, veal ragout, soup, a *huge* swiss cheese , and pancakes (or Cr\u00eape Suzette for posher readers). There\u2019s also a rather large chocolate fountain... We know that George Osborne is a big China fan. And he concluded the session on the Global Economic Outlook by urging global leaders to support Beijing. \u201cThe world has not been very good over previous centuries at accommodating rising powers,\u201d the chancellor warned. \u201cIt is massively in our interests that we bring China into the multilateral institutions of the world.....and make it feel part of the global system.\u201d  China really has dominated this year\u2019s World Economic Forum (along with the refugee crisis). Osborne\u2019s words may fall flat, though, if policymakers fumble the move to a more domestic-driven, consumer based economy. Especially if the credit bubble that has swelled over recent years bursts badly. Bank of Japan governor Kuroda\u2019s suggestion today that China should impose capital controls highlights the pressure on Beijing. Chris Giles of the FT explains: The subject of capital controls is very sensitive for the IMF because late last year it recommended the renminbi be admitted into the fund\u2019s elite basket of currencies, including the US dollar, euro, yen and sterling, on the grounds that it was now \u201cwidely used\u201d and \u201cfreely usable\u201d. Capital controls would undermine both conditions. George Osborne\u2019s comments won\u2019t spare Google from a grilling in parliament over the tax deal. There is plenty of concern that \u00a3130m in back taxes is a rather meagre sum, for a company of Google\u2019s size and importance. And the Public Accounts Committee is determined to dig into it. Meg Hillier MP, chair of the PAC, said overnight that she was \u201cshocked\u201d by the workaround methods used by multinationals. It doesn\u2019t reflect well on the tax officials, either: \u201cHMRC now needs to assure taxpayers that it will keep up the pressure to tackle whatever the next emerging issue is in real time, rather than years later. \u201cIt is effectively admitting it pulled in too little tax from Google for nine out of ten years. \u201cThis is not a great success rate and the Public Accounts Committee will be calling in HMRC and Google to explain. George Osborne has told the Guardian that the \u00a3130m tax deal announced with Google overnight is a \u201chuge step forward\u201d Speaking to my colleagues Larry and Jill just after his panel debate in Davos, the chancellor said he regarded it as a major success for the government. He told us: This is a major success of our tax policy. We\u2019ve got Google to pay taxes and I think that is a huge step forward and addresses that perfectly legitimate public anger that large corporations have not been paying tax. I think it\u2019s a really positive step. I hope to see more firms follow suit and of course I\u2019ve introduced a diverted profits tax which will require this going forward. So I think it\u2019s a big step forward and a victory for the government\u201d. Overnight, the search giant announced that it will pay \u00a3130m to the UK - a decade\u2019s worth of tax. It will also pay more taxes in the UK in future, as part of a shake-up of the way the multinational pays tax. Osborne\u2019s comments at Davos come after Labour shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised the deal. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson reports: People will be \u201csceptical\u201d about what he said looked like a \u201csweetheart deal\u201d, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday, adding that HMRC seemed to have settled for a \u201crelatively trivial amount of money.\u201d McDonnell will be asking HMRC to publish full details of what it believed Google owed. He said he would raise the issue in Parliament next week as the issue needed \u201cwider scrutiny\u201d. The session ended with Christine Lagarde calling for a new way of measuring economic success: I\u2019ll do a more thorough wrap-up in a minute. Tidjane Thiam, head of Credit Suisse, reckons we are not on the brink of another banking crisis despite the recent market turmoil. Q: Does Christine Lagarde think China needs capital controls? Lagarde replies that it wouldn\u2019t be a particularly good idea for Beijing to burn through all its reserves propping up the yuan. China needs to give clarity, certainty and one message on exactly how the exchange mechanism works, and what the yuan is being measured against. Onto China, which has been eating into its foreign exchange reserves in an attempt to support the yuan. Kuroda says that Beijing faces a tough battle, and may need consider new restrictions to prevent money leaving the country. He says: China\u2019s authorities have been struggling to avoid excessive depreciation or appreciation of its currency while also maintaining an accommodative monetary stance. My personal view, which may not be shared by the Chinese authorities is that in this somewhat contradictory situation, capital controls could be useful to manage the exchange rate as well as domestic monetary policy in a consistent and appropriate way. Japanese central bank governor Kuroda says that inflation, currently around zero, could strengthen significantly if the oil price recovers. And if not, he\u2019s prepared to do more. Echoing the famous pledge from ECB chief Mario Draghi, Kuroda says: The Bank of Japan is fully committed to achieving the price stability target of 2% and will do whatever it takes to achieve that target, at the earliest stage. We don\u2019t believe there are any limits to our policy tools, he adds. Japan\u2019s central bank chief, Haruhiko Kuroda, says he doesn\u2019t believe China\u2019s economy will crash. Markets have been volatile this year, against heightened uncertainty over China\u2019s economy and oil prices, he says. But he does not share the pessimistic view about the implications. China\u2019s slowdown is due to the challenge of rebalancing its economy. Q: Will Britain be in the EU in a year? Osborne says he is optimistic of getting a good deal for Britain and the European Union. And he insists that Europe needs to reform itself. I don\u2019t want my continent priced out of the world economy. And if the British people see we are delivering that change across Europe, they will vote to stay in a reformed EU. Osborne says that Europe likes to cut a deal at the 11th hour, because the Greek banks need to open or a bond needs paying. But we aren\u2019t behaving like the greek government. We have taken a much more measured approach, approaching Europe as friends, colleagues and allies. Osborne says that in \u201ca mature and measured way\u201d we can get that agreement, maybe at the February meeting. If it\u2019s not a good deal, Britain won\u2019t sign. But given all the challenges in the EU, I think it\u2019s in Europe\u2019s interests to give us a deal that works for all member states. W Q: Is there any chance of a deal in the next few weeks that will satisfy the huge eurosceptical forces in the UK? There will be people who want to leave Europe, come what may, and some who want to stay, George Osborne replies. But if David Cameron can come back with a creditble reform packate, we can make a case for staying. There is goodwill out there, we now have to make it happen. Britain has three priorities through our EU renegotiation, says Osborne: We want to create a more competitive European union, to create more jobs and growth Want to address concerns about migration. Mainstream governments should not ignore these pressure, but should address the legitimate concerns that can fuel them. Thirdly, we need a better working relationship between euro and non-euro countries, and the fact that large countries such as the UK will not be in the eurozone. There is a remorseless logic that the eurozone needs ever-closer union, and Britain does not want to be part of it, Osborne concludes. Now George Osborne speaks, saying his \u2018clear economic plan\u2019 has given the UK a pretty secure footing going forwards. But we don\u2019t duck big decisions - the Scottish referendum, for example, has \u201cchecked a move towards the break-up\u201d of the UK. And with the EU referendum, Britain is seeking a more competitive EU. I have sat on panels for five years, hearing people talk about creating more competition. Now we need to do it, says Osborne. And he cites an old Chinese proverb: Talk does not cook rice. On Europe, Lagarde says the economy is in better shape than a year ago,. But the IMF has two big concerns: One is Brexit, and whether there is a deal between the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. We hope very much [there is a deal], as it would really be conducive to more stability and a more cohesive economic zone. The second is the refugee crisis, which Lagarde calls a \u2018make-or-break\u2019 issue for Europe, Lagarde adds. If it is well-handled and the integration process is handled well, it will be an upside for the eurozone, boosting growth particularly in Sweden and Germany. So do you agree that the refugee crisis is \u2018make or break\u2019 for the Schengen area? Speaking personally, not as MD as the IMF, Yes, I think so, Lagarde replies. Lagarde says there are four key risks: China\u2019s economic rebalancing, as it moves from industry to service, export to domestic market,and investment to consumption. Commodity prices, where the fall has accelerated in the last 18 months. Asynchronous monetary policies around the world, creating capital flows as money returns to the US, depreciating the currencies of some emerging markets. And emerging markets - Lagarde says India and China are performing much better than Brazil or Russia. [Is this the death of the BRICS idea?] Christine Lagarde says the IMF believes the world economy will grow at a faster rate, even though it cut its growth forecasts this week. From 3.1% in 2015, the IMF expects growth of 3.4% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2017. Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam says the financial markets have had their worst start to a year ever. Fears over China\u2019s economy are a prime factor, prompting market turmoil and concerns that we could be heading into a global recession. Massive outflows from asset managers, some from sovereign wealth funds, as they face losses on their And there is a shortage of liquidity in the market, which means shares and bonds are more volatile. But investors are over-reacting, and should remember that the fall in the oil price is good for consumers, good for Europe, and good for 5 billion people who are net importers of oil. The FT\u2019s Martin Wolf is chairing the debate, and spending several minutes running through the state of play today. And it\u2019s not great - world stock markets are in turmoil, everyone\u2019s worrying about China, emerging economies face a tough year, the US economy may be slowing too, the migration crisis is threatening European Union, populism is on the rise, and Britain may be heading towards Brexit. What on earth is going on, he demands? Reminder, the panel are UK chancellor George Osborne, Japanese central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley, and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam. Cowbells are ringing across the Davos conference centre (yes, really), signalling that the debate on the Global Economy is starting now. This year, the Guardian\u2019s Davos bureau is a prime table at the heart of WEF, just outside the office of founder Klaus Schwab. And from there, we\u2019ve seen a string of senior politicians and top central bankers emerge from a meeting. That includes the IMF\u2019s Christine Lagarde, Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Finland\u2019s finance minister Alex Stubb, and Axel Weber of UBS. It\u2019s not a crisis meeting, though, but an IGWEL - an informal gathering of world and economic leaders. Stubb has helpfully tweeted from the meeting. Gideon Rachman, the Financial Times\u2019s top foreign affairs writer, reckons that this year\u2019s World Economic Forum has been dogged by the \u201cshadow of populism\u201d: Davos delegates shouldn\u2019t be surprised that the public are looking at the state of the world economy, and the political landscape, and decide that a change is needed. But the sort of populism promoted by Donald Trump is rather alien, and alarming, for those at WEF. Gideon writes: The shadow of Donald Trump has loomed over Davos this year. So has the prospect that refugee flows into Europe will undermine centrist leaders such as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. More broadly, those at Davos are aware that they increasingly represent the \u201cunpopular\u201d \u2014 the business and political elites that are the targets of public anger and disillusionment. Sooner or later, most corridor conversations in Davos have turned to the US presidential election. It is gradually dawning on people in the Swiss resort that either Mr Trump or Ted Cruz, the Texas senator, will probably win the Republican nomination, and that the \u201cunthinkable\u201d \u2014 a Trump or Cruz victory in November\u2019s presidential election \u2014 could happen. Our economics editor Larry Elliott has been coming to Davos for two decades. And he writes that this year\u2019s meeting has been particulary dominated downbeat. For Justin Welby, mulling over the state of the world in Davos has been easier than the previous week spent trying to hammer out an Anglican church compromise over gay marriage. The Archbishop of Canterbury even cracked one of the better jokes at the World Economic Forum. Asked whether god is in cyberspace, Welby replied: \u201cI think he must be because every time I am on the underground or a bus I see people looking at their computer or mobile phone saying \u2018oh god, why won\u2019t this work\u2019.\u201d Humour has been in short supply at this year\u2019s Davos. The optimism of a year ago that the global economy was on the up after the deep slump of 2008-09 has disappeared fast.... Here\u2019s the full piece: So, what have we learned from Davos this year? In a nutshell, the so-called \u2018global elite\u2019 are worried about a range of problems, and struggling to make much progress in solving them. There\u2019s been no end of talk about refugees, market turmoil, oil, the risk of a new pandemic, and gender inequality. But no real sign that we\u2019re close to a breakthrough on any of it. As one senior delegate put it, 2016 is going to be a year of shocks. Some delegates might be heading for the ski slopes but there still signs of work being done. It\u2019s all go in the main Congress centre this morning. We\u2019ve spotted Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Canada\u2019s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Credit Suisse and WPP\u2019s Sir Martin Sorrell coming from one direction. From another direction there\u2019s been a string of top bankers. To name a few: Ana Bot\u00edn of Santander, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio of Lloyds Banking Group, Bill Winters of Standard Chartered, Axel Webber of UBS and Stuart Gulliver of HSBC. A drugs scandal has hit Davos this year, in a serious embarrassment for the Swiss authorities. It\u2019s not the delegates who have been puffing and snorting, though, but a dozen of the soldiers who patrol the ski resorts roads. They\u2019ve been sent home, and may face criminal charges. The AFP newswire has the details: Twelve on-duty soldiers had tested positive on Tuesday for cannabis and five of them had also used cocaine, army spokesman Stefan Hofer told the ATS news agency. The twelve, among some 4,500 soldiers brought in to ensure security at the World Economic Forum this week, had been tested after others in their unit raised the alarm. Using drug-sniffing dogs, military police had also discovered that one of the soldiers had more than three grammes of cocaine in his possession, according to the report. Guten Morgen. Just like the wicked, there\u2019s no rest for the world\u2019s global elite. So world leaders, CEOs, union chiefs, economists and journalists are gathering for the final act of the 2016 World Economic Forum. There\u2019s a different feel in Davos today. Partly because it\u2019s Saturday, which means this gorgeous ski resort actually has some skiers here today, trudging through the snow alongside delegates. And partly because after three days discussing the problems of the world economy, everyone\u2019s a bit shattered and ready to go home. But not before the final big event, a debate on the world economy. On the panel: UK chancellor George Osborne, Japanese central banker Haruhiko Kuroda, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley, and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam. It begins in an hour\u2019s time, at 10.30am Davos time or 9.30am UK time. You should be able to watch it here. We\u2019ll cover it in this liveblog, along with any other major developments at Davos, and try to work out what (if anything) has been achieved this year....",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Inga Beale has made business history twice in her career \u2013 so far. Two years ago she became the first woman to be appointed as chief executive of the 328-year-old Lloyd\u2019s of London insurance market. Three months ago she made somewhat bigger headlines \u2013 as the first woman, and the first bisexual person, to head the annual power list of the top 100 LGBT \u2013 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \u2013 executives. She replaced Christopher Bailey, the head of Burberry, who is now ranked in only eighth place. Alan Joyce, chief executive of Australian airline Qantas, was second, followed by Ant\u00f3nio Sim\u00f5es, who heads HSBC\u2019s UK bank. Beale is proud of the accolade, but says: \u201cIt\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about what you do for other people. For me, it\u2019s so important because you need these role models.\u201d Speaking between meetings at the World Economic Forum in Davos, she says her position at the top of the LGBT table is important for its impact on others: \u201cIt\u2019s about giving people confidence,\u201d she says. Beale made a conscious decision to come out in 2008, telling a new employer about her sexuality. \u201cI said \u2018I\u2019m coming out, I can\u2019t live with this\u2019,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt felt refreshing: you felt light, you felt a weight had come off your shoulders.\u201d The issue of diversity is a regular on the Davos agenda at the WEF and Beale took part in a panel discussion, which also included Sim\u00f5es, to discuss ways to bridge the diversity gap. Davos has its own problems: the proportion of women at the strictly invitation-only event was just 18% this year. The organisers have made a high-profile and determined attempt to boost female attendance and 18% was the largest proportion since the event began in the 1970s \u2013 but women are making only marginal headway, because five years ago the proportion was 17%. Delegates have also been warned this year that the advent of new technology \u2013 dubbed \u201cthe fourth industrial revolution\u201d by the WEF organisers \u2013 will force more women out of work than men, presenting new challenges for those working to close the diversity divide. For Beale, there are clear business reasons for working on diversity. She cites research from LGBT campaign group Stonewall showing that productivity is 30% lower among individuals who hide their identities. \u201cIt eats away at you,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you do is, you de-genderise every statement you make. You\u2019re in a business environment; you de-gender everything, You never say he or she. You do it constantly. All these little things, that if you haven\u2019t experienced you just wouldn\u2019t appreciate. And suddenly you can be free.\u201d Two years ago she married Swiss-based jewellery designer Philippe Pfeiffer, and says people are more comfortable talking to her about her husband than when she was in a relationship with a woman. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting, they feel awkward. That\u2019s why when I talk about this I say let\u2019s use the words that people are uncomfortable using \u2013 lesbian, gay.\u201d Beale was appointed chief executive of Lloyd\u2019s in December 2013 \u2013 taking the helm of a historic market that had been entirely a male preserve until the 1970s. The first female broker at Lloyd\u2019s, Liliana Archibald, was allowed into the market in 1973 and is said to have commented after her first day that \u201cthe roof was still on\u201d. Beale\u2019s own early experiences working in the City in the 1980s were dispiriting. She quit after less than 10 years, fed up with an environment in which she felt it was necessary to drink pints and go to the pub. No one forced her to behave in that way, she explains, but \u201cI felt I had to \u2026 to be included.\u201d So a 27-year-old Beale \u2013 she did not go to university \u2013 embarked on a late gap year, ending up in Australia as a receptionist at the BBC, a role she took simply because she needed the money. But it turned out to be an enlightening experience \u2013 the operation was run by a woman, a role model of the kind that was absent from the City of the 1980s. It gave her the courage, she says, to return to her previous career \u2013 although she never expected to become a chief executive \u2013 and it helps her motivate staff. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for someone with a little spark, a little bit what I am, because I decided after eight, nine years in the City that I couldn\u2019t hack it any more, I left. So I naturally look for that. Something a little bit different, courageous. You have to be courageous as a leader. You\u2019ve got to make decisions. You\u2019ve got to have courage.\u201d But she adds: \u201cI also have to check myself for unconscious bias.\u201d At one point she had ended up running an entirely female team of insurance underwriters, and acknowledges now: \u201cYou also have to look for people who are different to you.\u201d Early in her career her focus was on sport rather than seeking promotion: she rowed and played rugby for the Wasps women\u2019s team. But Beale says she now enjoys managing people: \u201cI get much satisfaction from seeing teams succeeding.\u201d At Lloyd\u2019s her focus this year is on introducing technology in a market that is still based on face-to-face contact in a huge broking room at the heart of the landmark Lloyd\u2019s building. \u201cMy top priority this year is modernisation of the market. That means embracing digital and using technology.\u201d But she is also intent on retaining what she calls \u201cthe magic of Lloyd\u2019s \u2026the relationship-based negotiation that goes on.\u201d The market \u2013 which almost collapsed in the 1990s \u2013 is now backed by businesses, rather than the wealthy individuals known as Names who put their personal fortunes behind it, but brokers still use leather slipcases containing papers that are physically stamped. Climate change is another focus. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, gave a speech at Lloyd\u2019s last year in which he warned insurers they were exposed to climate change, while a report issued by WEF before the Davos summit rated a catastrophe caused by climate change as the biggest potential threat to the global economy in 2016. Two months on from the climate accord in Paris, the question of the environment was overshadowed at Davos by this year\u2019s stock market meltdown and the global economic implications of the tumbling price of oil. But climate is a key issue for Beale, along with tackling cyber-risk and meeting the challenges posed by rival markets. It is this tough competition that has also spurred Lloyd\u2019s to try to improve its own diversity, with more individuals from a wider range of backgrounds \u2013 German and Chinese speakers \u2013 as Beale pushes into emerging markets. Currently Lloyd\u2019s is two-thirds male, 90% white and 90% British. More diversity makes commercial sense, Beale says. So the market has policies to encourage difference \u2013 not just gender, race, sexuality and disability but also faith, age and family circumstances. She has spearheaded an Inclusion@Lloyd\u2019s initiative and also been involved in the launch of Pride@Lloyds, an internal LGBT employee resource group. Beale also reveals she has been taken by an idea: she heard the prime minister of Luxembourg talking about a law which requires the under-represented gender to make up 40% of the lists of candidates in the next election. \u201cThat\u2019s a fantastic idea,\u201d she says. \u201cNo discrimination against or for women, or no discrimination against or for men: 40%. I thought was a very nice take on this whole quotas thing.\u201d CV Born May 1963 Education Newbury College, Berkshire Career 1982-92, underwriter at Prudential Assurance; 1992-2006, Various roles at GE Insurance Solutions/GE Frankona Re; 2006-07, chief executive of reinsurer Converium; 2008-09, head of mergers and acquisitions, organisational transformation and internal consulting at Zurich Insurance; 2009-11, global chief underwriting officer at Zurich Insurance; 2012-13, chief executive of Canopius, a Lloyd\u2019s managing agent; 2014-present, chief executive, Lloyd\u2019s of London; external board member to the Financial Services Trade and Investment Board.",

Boeing had prolonged the life of the 45-year-old design with its latest, more fuel-efficient iteration, the 747-8, whose freight version looked to have particular potential with early sales. But the manufacturer said a stalling air cargo market was killing off demand for the plane. Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: \u201cThe air cargo market recovery that began in late 2013 has stalled in recent months and slowed demand for the 747-8 freighter.\u201d He added that Boeing remained confident that an \u201cupcoming replacement cycle\u201d for older 747 freighters meant there would still be a need to build more. But for now, he added: \u201cWe\u2019re taking the prudent step to further align production with current market requirements.\u201d Air freight traffic has shrunk slightly, with volumes down 1.2% from a year ago, according to figures from the International Air Transport Association. But soaring passenger numbers \u2013 up another 6% in the last year \u2013 have not come to the 747\u2019s aid. Competing visions of the future of aviation saw Boeing\u2019s great rival, Airbus, launch an even bigger plane, the A380 superjumbo, a fully double-decker design. While the A380 has also struggled to sell in the last two years, it has won most of the recent trade in the 747\u2019s patch, the market for giant passenger planes \u2013 once seen as essential for major international hubs like Heathrow, where landing slots are at a premium. Boeing has found more success of late in its midsize long-haul planes, such as the 787 Dreamliner, where it is planning to ramp up production. The cost of producing the 747 has for some time exceeded the revenue it has brought in, and the manufacturer said it would report an accounting charge of $569m in its forthcoming quarterly results to reflect the new reality. It had already warned that production would slow from 1.3 planes per month to a single unit from March, but now will be halving that rate again from September. One significant customer remains in the offing: the 747-8 has been designated the preferred choice for the forthcoming upgrade of the US Air Force One presidential fleet. But that is likely to be two or three planes, and although Boeing executives have hinted at other imminent sales opportunities, only around 20 are on order. More than 1,500 747s have been sold over four and a half decades and the plane was once known as the queen of the skies by pilots and spotters. But its popularity among airline accountants has plunged in the last 10 years as higher fuel costs and narrower profit margins made it economically unviable on many routes. Older 747s have become unwelcome at major airports such as Heathrow, where they are now subject to higher landing charges to compensate for the amount of noise and pollution they create compared with more modern aircraft. One glimmer of hope for the 747 had come from Moscow, with the Russian airline Transaero having placed an order for four jumbos. However, Boeing\u2019s order book was further thinned when Transaero filed for bankruptcy in November. Even that most prestigious of buyers, the president of the United States, may yet have to think twice if battles in Congress about the potential cost resume. With the second presidential plane now slated for 2020, his or her new 747s could be the last Boeing will build.",
