      "bodyText": "Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive was told about the company\u2019s illegal emissions crisis more than a year before it admitted it was systematically cheating on US regulators tests. The German company admitted on Wednesday that its former CEO Martin Winterkorn was, in May 2014, sent a memo detailing how some VW cars were producing up to 35 times more nitrogen oxide emissions than allowed. In the memo Winterkorn was told about an independent study that found VW cars were producing very high emissions in real life, but very low emissions under strict test conditions. Up until now the company has said Winterkorn \u2013 who resigned after the scandal broke in September 2015 \u2013 was unaware of the issue, which was caused by an illegal \u201cdefeat device\u201d software VW installed in US cars specifically to trick US regulators. In a statement on Wednesday the company continued to defend Winterkorn saying there was no evidence that he had read the memo, which was included in \u201chis extensive weekend mail\u201d. However, VW said Winterkorn was told again about the problem in November 2014. At that point he was told that fixing the problem in the US would cost about \u20ac20m (\u00a314.2bn, $21.7m). On 23 May 2014, a memo about the ICCT study was prepared for Martin Winterkorn, then-Chairman of the Management Board of Volkswagen AG. This memo was included in his extensive weekend mail. Whether and to which extent Mr. Winterkorn took notice of this memo at that time is not documented. On 14 November 2014, Mr. Winterkorn received another memo that reported, amongst other things, on several then current product defect cases and referred to a cost framework of approx. EUR 20 million for the diesel issue in North America. The company still did not come clean about its systematic emissions cheating, which was made public by the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) in September 2016. The VW memo also reveals that Winterkorn and VW\u2019s chairman Herbert Diess were present at a July 2015 meeting at which the diesel issue was discussed. VW said it was \u201cnot clear whether there participants understood already at this point in time that the change in the software violated US environmental regulations\u201d. The company said Winterkorn \u201casked for further clarification of the issue\u201d. \u201cThe diesel issue, as it was treated as one of many product issues facing the company, did not initially receive particular attention at the management levels of Volkswagen,\u201d the company said. A month later VW technicians told a member of the company\u2019s board that the cars were equipped with illegal \u201cdefeat device\u201d software designed to trick regulators into believing that its cars are greener than they really are. It took another month for VW to admit its misdeeds to US regulators. The EPA made it public later in September. VW released the detailed chronology of its senior management\u2019s knowledge of the emissions crisis as part of its defence in a lawsuit brought by investors who claim that senior management knew of the illegal activity, which has wiped billions of euros of the company\u2019s market value. \u201cAfter careful examination by internal and external legal experts, the company confirms its belief that its management board duly fulfilled its disclosure obligation under German capital markets law,\u201d Volkswagen said. Volkswagen has set aside more than $7bn to cover the cost of the scandal, but some analysts have said it could cost as much as $17bn.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, which is owned by BMW, has written to all its workers in Britain to warn that exit from the European Union would drive up costs and prices and could affect the company\u2019s \u201cemployment base\u201d. The letter, leaked to the Guardian, is one of six sent by the bosses of each of BMW\u2019s British companies, including MINI, to their staff each warning of the dangers of UK withdrawal. It comes after the government warned that car-makers would be among those badly hit by Brexit in a civil service report. Torsten Muller-Otvos, chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, told staff that the decision about whether to remain in the EU would be down to British voters. But he added: \u201cFree trade is important for international business. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars exports motor cars throughout the EU and imports a significant number of parts through the region. \u201cFor BMW Group, more than half of MINIs built and virtually all the engines and components made in the UK are exported to the EU, with over 150,000 new cars and many hundreds of thousands of parts imported from Europe each year. \u201cTariff barriers would mean higher costs and higher prices and we cannot assume that the UK would be granted free trade with Europe from outside the EU. Our employment base could also be affected, with skilled men and women from most EU countries included in the 30 nationalities currently represented at the home of Rolls-Royce here at Goodwood.\u201d Out campaigners will be angry about this intervention by BMW, asking why a German multinational is wading into the debate over Britain\u2019s future in the EU. Both Rolls-Royce and BMW admitted that emails and letters had been sent out to 8,000 employees, including workers in Goodwood, West Sussex, and Oxford. The parent and its subsidiary insisted that they were not trying to influence their staff when it came to the June referendum. All letters said that Britain would have to abide by EU regulation rules whatever the outcome of the referendum. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s much better to be sat at the table when regulations are set and have a hand in their creation, rather than simply having to accept them.\u201d Richard Carter, director of communications at Rolls-Royce, said he believed the letter was justified, arguing that it was the company\u2019s duty to outline its position to employees and tell them the risks of Brexit. \u201cOnce the British people have decided we will have to judge that decision from a business point of view,\u201d he said, arguing that Brexit would have a huge impact on the company. Graham Biggs, of BMW group, added that the bosses were simply setting out the company\u2019s position because many staff had asked for it. BMW was among the signatories of a business letter \u2013 organised by government \u2013 in favour of EU membership. Nick Herbert, the chairman of Conservative In \u2013 the party\u2019s pro-EU campaign group \u2013 said that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was one of the most important employers in West Sussex where he is an MP. \u201cThe calm and sober statements of the facts by companies like Rolls-Royce remind us of the advantages of being in the single market. The more I hear things like this, the more sure I am that Britain will be better off remaining in a reformed EU,\u201d he said. Paul Stephenson, a spokesman for Vote Leave, pointed out that a number of car companies \u2013 including Toyota, Vauxhall, Bentley and Nissan \u2013 had said they would continue to invest in the UK. He said the \u201cpersonal views of chief executives\u201d did not represent the opinions of employees or shareholders. \u201cBig foreign, multinational companies like the EU because they spend millions lobbying it in order to stitch up the rules in their favour \u2013 forcing smaller players out of business.\u201d The Green party MP Caroline Lucas will make the \u201cpeace argument\u201d against Brexit on Thursday, warning that EU membership is Britain\u2019s best defence against the risk of Europe descending into war. \u201cEurope is not, historically, a very peaceful place,\u201d she will say, in a lecture at the London School of Economics. \u201cIt would be sheer folly to think that armed conflict cannot return. We cannot know what dangers lie ahead. But we can be sure that a strong and stable European Union, with Britain as an active and positive participant, provides the surest guarantee of our national security.\u201d Meanwhile Boris Johnson, a Tory MP and one of the most high-profile outers, will be taken on by his own brother. Jo Johnson, the science minister, will say: \u201cIn this referendum campaign, it is vital that we have an evidence-based debate and properly informed choice. The facts matter. And few value evidence more than scientists. That\u2019s why we should take seriously the surveys showing nine out of 10 agree EU membership benefits UK science and engineering.\u201d He said Britain could \u201csurvive and prosper\u201d outside the EU but challenged those who want to leave to explain how the levels of investment will be maintained. This article was amended on 3 March 2016 to correct a reference to Caroline Lucas as the Green party leader. Lucas is the party\u2019s single MP, while Natalie Bennett is the leader of the party.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Please don\u2019t call them financial barbarians, break-up merchants or short-termists out to make a quick buck before hot-footing it back to California. ValueAct, the US hedge fund being ushered into Rolls-Royce\u2019s boardroom, would like you to know that it is the cooperative sort of activist investor, the type that doesn\u2019t quarrel in public and is full of helpful ideas delivered in a spirit of peace, admiration and mutual long-term understanding. This pitch from ValueAct, owner of 10.8% of the engine-maker, has certainly worked on Rolls\u2019 chairman. Ian Davis said Bradley Singer, the fund\u2019s man on the job, has \u201can outstanding record as a business leader\u201d. He also brings a US perspective \u2013 apparently useful given Rolls\u2019 interests over there. A non-executive director, you\u2019d almost think, who could have been appointed even if ValueAct hadn\u2019t requested the boardroom seat itself. It is possible that life could turn out so happily. Active, engaged investors \u2013 provided they really do have a long-term outlook \u2013 can do valuable work in holding managements to account. There are many examples. Singer is also an experienced former finance director and Rolls, after five profits warnings in two years, could use some help in compiling accurate information about its own market. Warren East, the chief executive since last summer, has himself complained about \u201caccounting fog\u201d. But there are least three reasons to worry. First, is ValueAct really arriving with an open mind on strategy? It\u2019s impossible to know, but a break-up would seem to be the last thing Rolls needs. It would be useful if ValueAct had said so openly. There is a potential slippery slope if the board is cajoled into a series of compromises \u2013 for example, selling the marine or power systems divisions. Second, Rolls measures its investment horizons in decades in the aerospace game. The US fund, by contrast, holds its stakes for about three years on average. The contrast doesn\u2019t necessarily imply conflict when signing off on research and development budgets \u2013 but the possibility is there. Third, ValueAct has success stories like Microsoft on its CV but there\u2019s also Valeant Pharmaceuticals. This former debt-fuelled acquisition machine now finds itself in the midst of a US political storm over price-gouging on medicines; the share price is two-thirds below its peak. Valeant is a hard one to explain if you\u2019re trying to present yourself as the antithesis of a financial engineer. In the end, Rolls\u2019 shareholders will decide. Davis expects a large majority in favour of Singer\u2019s appointment at the next annual meeting and he is probably correct. Given Rolls\u2019 recent record and dividend cut, any sort of change can feel like an improvement. But one wonders what East really thinks. He\u2019s barely had time to get a grip on Rolls and now a recently arrived hedge fund has the right to question every detailed decision he makes from across the boardroom table. It\u2019s not how he built Arm Holdings\u2019 success. Big picture is unclear at ITV Special dividends no longer excite investors in ITV, it seems. The share price fell 3.5% even as the broadcaster and programme-maker declared a 10p-a-share special on top of a 6.5p ordinary dividend, itself a 28% improvement on a year ago. The reaction looks churlish. It is true that specials have ceased to be unusual at ITV \u2013 this was the fourth year in a row of such a handout \u2013 but this year\u2019s version was bigger than in the past and ITV isn\u2019t having to break sweat to fund it. The balance sheet looks solid. There are two possible explanations. Perhaps shareholders took fright at chief executive Adam Crozier\u2019s confession that advertising revenues will be flat in the first quarter. Yet there was a reasonable-sounding explanation: advertisers are waiting for Euro 2016 football to kick off in June. Or perhaps ITV is no longer seen as a sitting duck for a takeover bid.

ValueAct, the US hedge fund being ushered into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/02/rolls-royce-appoints-valueact-chief-operating-officer-to-board\">Rolls-Royce\u2019s boardroom</a>, would like you to know that it is the cooperative sort of activist investor, the type that doesn\u2019t quarrel in public and is full of helpful ideas delivered in a spirit of peace, admiration and mutual long-term understanding.</p> <p>This pitch from ValueAct, owner of 10.8% of the engine-maker, has certainly worked on Rolls\u2019 chairman. Ian Davis said Bradley Singer, the fund\u2019s man on the job, has \u201can outstanding record as a business leader\u201d. He also brings a US perspective \u2013 apparently useful given Rolls\u2019 interests over there. A non-executive director, you\u2019d almost think, who could have been appointed even if ValueAct hadn\u2019t requested the boardroom seat itself.</p> <p>It is possible that life could turn out so happily. Active, engaged investors \u2013 provided they really do have a long-term outlook \u2013 can do valuable work in holding managements to account. There are many examples. Singer is also an experienced former finance director and Rolls, after five profits warnings in two years, could use some help in compiling accurate information about its own market. Warren East, the chief executive since last summer, has himself complained about \u201caccounting fog\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/02/no-breakup-rolls-royce-activist-investor-board-chairman\">No breakup at Rolls despite activist investor on board, says chairman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there are least three reasons to worry. First, is ValueAct really arriving with an open mind on strategy? It\u2019s impossible to know, but a break-up would seem to be the last thing Rolls needs. It would be useful if ValueAct had said so openly. There is a potential slippery slope if the board is cajoled into a series of compromises \u2013 for example, selling the marine or power systems divisions.</p> <p>Second, Rolls measures its investment horizons in decades in the aerospace game. The US fund, by contrast, holds its stakes for about three years on average. The contrast doesn\u2019t necessarily imply conflict when signing off on research and development budgets \u2013 but the possibility is there.</p> <p>Third, ValueAct has success stories like Microsoft on its CV but there\u2019s also Valeant Pharmaceuticals. This former debt-fuelled acquisition machine now finds itself in the midst of a US political storm over price-gouging on medicines; the share price is two-thirds below its peak. Valeant is a hard one to explain if you\u2019re trying to present yourself as the antithesis of a financial engineer.</p> <p>In the end, Rolls\u2019 shareholders will decide. Davis expects a large majority in favour of Singer\u2019s appointment at the next annual meeting and he is probably correct. Given Rolls\u2019 recent record and dividend cut, any sort of change can feel like an improvement.</p> <p>But one wonders what East really thinks. He\u2019s barely had time to get a grip on Rolls and now a recently arrived hedge fund has the right to question every detailed decision he makes from across the boardroom table. It\u2019s not how he built Arm Holdings\u2019 success.</p> <h2>Big picture is unclear at ITV</h2> <p>Special dividends no longer excite investors in ITV, it seems. The share price fell 3.5% even as the broadcaster and programme-maker declared a 10p-a-share special on top of a 6.5p ordinary dividend, itself a 28% improvement on a year ago.</p> <p>The reaction looks churlish. It is true that specials have ceased to be unusual at ITV \u2013 this was the fourth year in a row of such a handout \u2013 but this year\u2019s version was bigger than in the past and ITV isn\u2019t having to break sweat to fund it. The balance sheet looks solid.</p> <p>There are two possible explanations. Perhaps shareholders took fright at chief executive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/17/itv-finances-new-shows-adam-crozier-simon-cowell\">Adam Crozier</a>\u2019s confession that advertising revenues will be flat in the first quarter. Yet there was a reasonable-sounding explanation: advertisers are waiting for Euro 2016 football to kick off in June.</p> <p>Or perhaps ITV is no longer seen as a sitting duck for a takeover bid. That seems more plausible. It is now a \u00a310bn company and, as Crozier likes to boast, the world\u2019s biggest programme producer outside the US majors. So it\u2019s hardly an easily digested morsel even for the big beasts of the media jungle.

The action brought by London lawyers Leigh Day on behalf of the Ogale and Bille communities alleges that decades of uncleaned oil spills have polluted fishing waters and contaminated farming land. Last year Leigh Day won $83.5m in damages from Shell at the high court in London for the Bodo community, who live elsewhere in the Niger delta. In a statement before the hearing on Wednesday, Shell blamed sabotage and oil theft for the pollution. The company said it had halted production more than two decades ago in Ogoniland, the area where the two communities are located. Shell said it would challenge the jurisdiction of the British court: \u201cAsking the English court to intervene ... is a direct challenge to the internal political acts and decisions of the Nigerian state.\u201d Human rights activists argue that such pollution levels would never be tolerated in the home countries of such multinationals. Ogoni protests in the 1990s were attacked by troops who turned the oil-producing south into a war zone.

At a hearing in the technology and construction court, Judge Raeside QC said legal proceedings against Royal Dutch Shell and the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria. Ogale is located in the Rivers State in Nigeria and has an estimated population of more than 40,000. It was said to have been has been subjected to repeated oil spillages since at least 1989. Residents of Bille have traditionally relied on fishing but oil spills are alleged to have destroyed their livelihood. Daniel Leader, a solicitor partner at Leigh Day, said: \u201cIt is scandalous that four year after the United Nations Environment Programme report, Shell is yet to clean up its oil in either Ogale or Bille. Our clients\u2019 patience has now run out and we intend to force Shell to act since it is clear they have no intention of doing so on their own. Given the extent of the damage, we believe that the cleanup costs for both communities will run into several hundred million pounds. The claims from the thousands of individuals affected by this pollution, could run into tens of millions of pounds given the impact on these communities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The early signs for the GDP figures were not good \u2013 capital expenditure was weak and the outlook terrible, and on Tuesday the latest balance of payments figures showed that net exports would contribute nothing to GDP growth in the December quarter. But then the figures came out on Wednesday showing that in seasonally adjusted terms the economy grew by 0.6% in December and a very solid 3.0% for the year. The big bump in annual growth from 2.5% in September was due to the ABS revising up the September quarterly growth figures from 0.9% to 1.1%. But even the trend figures showed growth of 0.7% in December and 2.8% for the year: The trend figures actually show some pretty nice numbers across the board. Per capita GDP is going well, and even nominal GDP, while still well down on what we would usually expect is doing OK at 2.5% annual growth: So where did this growth come from? Thank the households (and the houses). The biggest contributor to growth in both the December quarter and in all of 2015 in seasonally adjusted terms was household spending: Of the 0.6% GDP growth in December, household spending accounted for more than three-quarters with 0.4% points. The spending by householders more than made up for the drop in investment in the mining sector and other industries. The housing boom has also been helping to keep the economy ticking over. In 2015, private dwelling construction contributed 0.49% points to GDP growth. What is clear however is that the growth in the building of houses and apartments is not enough to counter the fall in construction elsewhere, as non-dwelling construction reduced GDP growth in 2015 by 1.1% points in seasonally adjusted terms and 0.9% points in trend terms: So what were we spending all that money on that was helping growth the economy so much? Well you might not believe it, but in the December quarter, the biggest contributor to household spending was recreation and culture. Yes Christmas helps, but the December quarter is not usually the biggest growth quarter for recreation. Annually, the story is less joyous \u2013 rents and insurance accounted for nearly a third of the 2.9% increase in household consumption: One area we continue to spend less money on is cigarettes and tobacco. In trend terms, the consumption of the nicotine sticks fell 2.5% in December and 11.4% in all of 2105. Exports are still doing well though. As I noted when the last GDP figures came out, one of the problems with relying on exports to grow your economy is that they are pretty erratic \u2013 especially in seasonally adjusted terms. In the December quarter the volume of exports grew by just 0.6%, down from the 5.4% growth in September but well above the fall of 3.9% in June (see what I mean about erratic): Imports in seasonally adjusted terms grew by 0.6% in December so the growth of net exports (exports minus imports) was effectively zero, and as a result they added nothing to growth. But when we turn to the trend figures things look rather different. Net exports were actually the biggest contributor to trend growth in the December quarter \u2013 adding 0.45% points out of the 0.7% GDP increase. Given the erratic nature of exports, it is best not to focus on the seasonally adjusted data, but rather go with the more calm trend version. And even better, forget about the quarterly growth and look at annual growth. On this score net exports are still contributing well to annual GDP growth: Indeed, in 2015, the contribution of net exports completely cancelled out the detraction of growth that came from the collapse in investment: Is mining still king? Yep, there may be a massive collapse in investment, but the growth in mining exports still sees the mining industry as the biggest contributor to GDP growth: But the manufacturing industry? Oh dear. It continued its long run of detracting from GDP growth. In terms of industry growth itself (as opposed to contribution to GDP), the big winner was real estate services \u2013 we\u2019re clearly still buying houses (and paying rents): Demand is still weak \u2013 especially out west. Strong household consumption and private dwelling consumption combined to keep total demand (the combination of consumption and investment) growth positive in the December quarter. Also of assistance \u2013 at least in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 was a big growth in public investment, both defence and non-defence. But in trend terms government investment wasn\u2019t a factor at all. And if we look at the annual growth of both private and public investment we see that public investment is doing little to bring up the slack from the end of the mining boom: There are signs the infrastructure spending is picking up, but it is still a little way from really assisting economic growth. The collapse of investment in the mining sector also continues to see demand in Western Australia absolutely plummet. In trend terms, final demand in Western Australia has now been falling for more than two years and is back at the level it was in September 2011: And you really see the change in the structure of our economy when you look at the contribution of NSW and Victoria\u2019s demand to GDP growth compared to that of WA and Queensland: The two eastern states are powering the way, with the mining states dragging us down (but of course, you don\u2019t count exports). So things are looking quite good, all things considered. We\u2019re spending nicely, our investment in the housing sector continues to do well, and most industries are growing. But the falling value of our exports and very weak wages growth has not seen this economic growth translate into income. In December the value of real net national disposable income (the ABS\u2019s broad measure of national economic well-being) fell 0.3% and in 2015 it fell 1.2%: But for now at least talk of a recession is left behind. So far our household spending and our building of apartments and houses has helped alleviate the shift from the mining boom \u2013 exactly as the RBA hoped it would when it cut rates to these current record lows. And the export phase of the mining boom continues its erratic yet substantial contribution to our economy. It\u2019s just that unlike its predecessor the investment boom it isn\u2019t doing much to contribute to our overall economic well being.",

But even the trend figures showed growth of 0.7% in December and 2.8% for the year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"fsfsd\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PEJQA/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The trend figures actually show some pretty nice numbers across the board. Per capita GDP is going well, and even nominal GDP, while still well down on what we would usually expect is doing OK at 2.5% annual growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1XwiJ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So where did this growth come from? Thank the households (and the houses). The biggest contributor to growth in both the December quarter and in all of 2015 in seasonally adjusted terms was household spending:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g3\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ln88c/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\u201dallowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Of the 0.6% GDP growth in December, household spending accounted for more than three-quarters with 0.4% points. The spending by householders more than made up for the drop in investment in the mining sector and other industries.</p> <p>The housing boom has also been helping to keep the economy ticking over. In 2015, private dwelling construction contributed 0.49% points to GDP growth. What is clear however is that the growth in the building of houses and apartments is not enough to counter the fall in construction elsewhere, as non-dwelling construction reduced GDP growth in 2015 by 1.1% points in seasonally adjusted terms and 0.9% points in trend terms:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XJwwN/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So what were we spending all that money on that was helping growth the economy so much? Well you might not believe it, but in the December quarter, the biggest contributor to household spending was recreation and culture. Yes Christmas helps, but the December quarter is not usually the biggest growth quarter for recreation.</p> <p>Annually, the story is less joyous \u2013 rents and insurance accounted for nearly a third of the 2.9% increase in household consumption:</p> <p>One area we continue to spend less money on is cigarettes and tobacco. In trend terms, the consumption of the nicotine sticks fell 2.5% in December and 11.4% in all of 2105. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/FSo5Z/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" allowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"525\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Exports are still doing well though. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/dec/03/australias-gdp-up-09-over-quarter-great-headline-but-not-the-full-story\">As I noted when the last GDP figures came out</a>, one of the problems with relying on exports to grow your economy is that they are pretty erratic \u2013 especially in seasonally adjusted terms. In the December quarter the volume of exports grew by just 0.6%, down from the 5.4% growth in September but well above the fall of 3.9% in June (see what I mean about erratic):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eYAp1/1/\" frameborder=\"0\"allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\"mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\"oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\"height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Imports in seasonally adjusted terms grew by 0.6% in December so the growth of net exports (exports minus imports) was effectively zero, and as a result they added nothing to growth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"g6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QsRPZ/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But when we turn to the trend figures things look rather different. Net exports were actually the biggest contributor to trend growth in the December quarter \u2013 adding 0.45% points out of the 0.7% GDP increase.</p> <p>Given the erratic nature of exports, it is best not to focus on the seasonally adjusted data, but rather go with the more calm trend version. And even better, forget about the quarterly growth and look at annual growth. On this score net exports are still contributing well to annual GDP growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog7\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/mxj0J/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>Indeed, in 2015, the contribution of net exports completely cancelled out the detraction of growth that came from the collapse in investment:<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog8\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DfLcN/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>Is mining still king? Yep, there may be a massive collapse in investment, but the growth in mining exports still sees the mining industry as the biggest contributor to GDP growth:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog9\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qQn59/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"600\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>But the manufacturing industry? Oh dear. It continued its long run of detracting from GDP growth. In terms of industry growth itself (as opposed to contribution to GDP), the big winner was real estate services \u2013 we\u2019re clearly still buying houses (and paying rents):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grog10\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/oqluI/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>Demand is still weak \u2013 especially out west. Strong household consumption and private dwelling consumption combined to keep total demand (the combination of consumption and investment) growth positive in the December quarter. Also of assistance \u2013 at least in seasonally adjusted terms \u2013 was a big growth in public investment, both defence and non-defence.</p> <p>But in trend terms government investment wasn\u2019t a factor at all. And if we look at the annual growth of both private and public investment we see that public investment is doing little to bring up the slack from the end of the mining boom:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"pub\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/P0rDU/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>There are signs the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/feb/18/the-infrastructure-plan-sounds-great-but-what-to-build-and-how-to-fund-it\">infrastructure spending is picking up</a>, but it is still a little way from really assisting economic growth.</p> <p>The collapse of investment in the mining sector also continues to see demand in Western Australia absolutely plummet. In trend terms, final demand in Western Australia has now been falling for more than two years and is back at the level it was in September 2011:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"demand\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/0S2yx/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>And you really see the change in the structure of our economy when you look at the contribution of NSW and Victoria\u2019s demand to GDP growth compared to that of WA and Queensland:</p> <p>The two eastern states are powering the way, with the mining states dragging us down (but of course, you don\u2019t count exports).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"staes\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rwWEf/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>So things are looking quite good, all things considered. We\u2019re spending nicely, our investment in the housing sector continues to do well, and most industries are growing. But the falling value of our exports and very weak wages growth has not seen this economic growth translate into income.</p> <p>In December the value of real net national disposable income (the ABS\u2019s broad measure of national economic well-being) fell 0.3% and in 2015 it fell 1.2%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"12\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/35307/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But for now at least talk of a recession is left behind. So far our household spending and our building of apartments and houses has helped alleviate the shift from the mining boom \u2013 exactly as the RBA hoped it would when it cut rates to these current record lows.</p> <p>And the export phase of the mining boom continues its erratic yet substantial contribution to our economy. It\u2019s just that unlike its predecessor the investment boom it isn\u2019t doing much to contribute to our overall economic well being.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Keith Hellawell has vowed to continue as chairman of Sports Direct in a snub to shareholders and campaigners calling for his head after the retailer\u2019s relegation from the FTSE 100. In an interview with the Guardian, the former chief constable suggested the retailer\u2019s difficulties with the City were largely cosmetic, despite concerns over the group\u2019s trading and its treatment of workers \u2013 as well as longstanding investor complaints including the influence of 55% shareholder Mike Ashley and the failure to hire a permanent finance director for two years. Hellawell said: \u201cYes, I do [think I\u2019m going to stay as chairman] \u2026 That is the plan, yes. I think there are a number of issues we are looking at in relation to the way in which we relate to the City \u2013 our investor relations certainly need to be improved. The issues in relation to corporate governance are very often overstated and they relate to the time we have been without a finance director, which we are resolving.\u201d Hellawell\u2019s comments appeared to make light of City concerns about the company\u2019s governance, which have resulted in investors pressing for the retailer to find a new chairman to challenge the dominance of Ashley. On Wednesday, the Sports Direct shareholder Standard Life said in its annual report into corporate governance report: \u201cIn view of the continued failure of [Sports Direct\u2019s] remuneration committee to address our concerns and in view of some wider concerns about the governance of the company, we voted against the re-election of the chairman, the senior independent director and the chairman of the remuneration committee [at the group\u2019s last annual meeting in September] to emphasise the importance we attach to these matters.\u201d The protest votes came on top of comments at the time by another shareholder, Royal London Asset Management, which said it had lost confidence in the board. Before the meeting, the Investment Association issued a red-top alert on the company, its most severe warning to investors. Of Sports Direct\u2019s independent shareholders who voted, almost a third refused to back the re-election of Hellawell as chairman. Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, which has led a long-running campaign on the treatment of Sports Direct workers, said: \u201cKeith Hellawell needs to consider his position. On his watch Sports Direct has become the poster boy for bad British business with a reputation for shady corporate governance and draconian working practices. \u201cThe retailer needs to heed the message being delivered by the City with a fundamental rethink of its corporate structures and the way it treats its workforce. Otherwise investors will continue to turn their backs on a company that brings with it a stench of abuse and malpractice.\u201d Sports Direct\u2019s relegation from the FTSE 100 was formally confirmed on Wednesday as part of the quarterly reshuffling of stock market indices based on Tuesday night\u2019s closing prices. At that point, Sports Direct was ranked as the 142nd most valuable company on the main list of the London stock exchange, thereby demoting it to the FTSE 250 index of smaller companies. The relegation came after a torrid three months in which \u00a31.6bn was wiped from the retailer\u2019s value after a slump in the group\u2019s trading and an undercover Guardian investigation that revealed how thousands of temporary Sports Direct warehouse workers were receiving hourly rates in effect below the minimum wage. The minimum wage disclosures prompted the Institute of Directors to brand the company a \u201cscar on British business\u201d and Labour\u2019s former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna to file an urgent parliamentary question, which resulted in the business minister, Nick Boles, being summoned to the Commons to answer questions on the scandal. Sports Direct denied paying less than the minimum wage. It responded by announcing a pay rise for its staff, as well as a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which was to be overseen by Ashley. When asked for a progress report on the billionaire\u2019s review, Hellawell said: \u201cI think it\u2019s still under review. He\u2019s looking at a lot of things within the company particularly in relation to the way we reward our staff which, obviously, we regard quite highly. He reported to the last board on the work that was being done and he\u2019ll report to the next board on further developments. \u201cWe meet quite frequently. I think the next scheduled board \u2013 we\u2019re probably going to meet within the next three or four weeks.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The rally of recent days seemed set to continue after a strong performance from Asian markets, but as the day wore on it ran out of steam. A volatile oil price did not help. Early gains for the crude price reversed sharply in the wake of higher than expected US stocks. But then investors noticed the oil update also showed a fall in US production, which helped lift the crude price once more, as did talk that Saudi Arabia was negotiating a possible $10bn loan. So after all that, the FTSE 100 was virtually unchanged but other markets in Europe ended higher but off their best levels. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 5.82 points or 0.09% Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.61% to 9776.62 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.41% at 4424.89 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 1.08% to 18,206.41 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.78% at 8764.5 In Greece, the Athens market added 3.02% to 535.78 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 35 points or 0.2%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow for a whole host of services PMI data to digest. San Francisco Federal Reserve president John Williams has dismissed concerns that the US could be heading for recession. He told a group of businessmen that domestic demand was strong enough to overcome any economic weakness abroad. He said raising interest rates was the right strategy, but emphasised that any rate hikes would be gradual. And if the Fed did need to ease policy, he would rather use tried and tested methods such as quantitative easing rather than negative interest rates. US Fed chair Janet Yellen said last month that negative rates were not off the table. As if to emphasise the volatility of the oil price and the markets generally, crude is now rallying despite the higher than expected US inventory figure. The impetus appears to be a Reuters report suggesting that oil producer Saudi Arabia has asked banks to discuss giving it an international loan that could total $10bn. Brent crude is currently up 0.79% at $37.10 a barrel, having fallen as low as $36.1 in the wake of the US stock figures. News of the big jump in US crude stocks has had a predictable effect. Brent crude, having been as high as $36.99 a barrel, is now down 1% at $36.41, while West Texas Intermediate - the US benchmark - has fallen 1.5% to $33.86. Meanwhile stock markets have also fallen further, as investors use the excuse to take some profits from the recent rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now off 77 points or 0.46% while the FTSE 100 has fallen 48 points or 0.79%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: After a positive start markets in Europe have slipped back from their intraday peaks as cautious profit taking started to creep into a market that has been on a good run of late. A slide back in oil prices appears to have been the main catalyst behind the caution now permeating into some of today\u2019s more cautious trading, as US oil inventories rose sharply by over 10m barrels, reflecting a similar sharp rise in the API numbers late last night. And storing all these stocks of crude is a growing issue: The headline rise of 10.37m was the biggest weekly increase since April 2015, said the Energy Information Administration. And imports also rose sharply: Crude stocks in the US jumped by much more than forecast last week, renewing fears of oversupply at a time when producers are reluctant to reduce output. They rose by 10.37m barrels to 517.98m, compared to expectations of a rise of 3.6m. But weekly gasoline stocks fell by 1.47m barrels, rather than the forecast increase of 1.08m. Risks in the UK housing market are growing but they are not as bad as in 2014, according to Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe. Reuters reports: [Cunliffe] also said the growth of the rapidly growing so-called \u201cbuy-to-let\u201d rental property sector potentially poses a financial stability risk. The Bank of England has asked the government for the power to intervene in the sector, which is likely to be approved. A public consultation on the matter will continue until March 11. \u201cThe risks are a bit less now than they were in 2014 but you can see the market starting to move back again,\u201d Cunliffe told a parliamentary committee. \u201cThe market is now coming back again so maybe some of those risks are becoming a little bit more prominent.\u201d More hints of slight weakness in the US economy, from the New York Institute of Supply Management index for February: A dip in the oil price has taken the shine off the global rally, with Wall Street heading lower in early trading and other markets off their best levels. Data from the American Petroleum Institute late on Tuesday showed crude inventories rose by 9.9m barrels last week, sending Brent down 0.7% to $36.55. Department of Energy data due out later could either confirm this trend, or reverse it, given how volatile the oil price has been in recent times. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently off 30 points or 0.18%. The S&amp;P 500 opened 0.2% lower and Nasdaq down 0.17%. In Europe, the FTSE 100 is 23 points or 0.4% lower while France\u2019s Cac is virtually flat and Germany\u2019s Dax has edged up 0.16%. How resilient is the eurozone to another economic downturn? Not very resilient at all, if you believe French bank Credit Suisse. They\u2019ve warned that a new recession would trigger deeper political turmoil, putting the single currency under very heavy strain. Mehreen Kahn of the Telegraph has the details: In a research note titled \u201cClose to the edge\u201d, economists at French bank Credit Suisse warned the fate of monetary union hangs in the balance if Europe\u2019s policymakers are unable to ward off another global slump and keep in check anti-euro populism. \u201cThe viability of the euro is contingent on the current recovery,\u201d said Peter Foley at Credit Suisse. \u201cIf the euro area were to relapse back into recession, it is not clear it would endure.\u201d Is a recession imminent? Well, the eurozone has been growing at a lacklustre 0.3% per quarter recently, so it wouldn\u2019t take must to knock it back to stagnation. The EC is more confident, though, predicting growth of 1.7% this year. City chartists are squinting at their screens, wondering if the FTSE 100 rally is about to continue or fizzle out. Apparently we\u2019ve just reached an \u2018initial support level\u2019, based on recent trading, which could signal that the market will rise. Unless it falls though this level, in which case it might keep falling. Tricky stuff, chartism... Today\u2019s US jobs report show that the American economy isn\u2019t sliding into recession, says Paul Ashcroft of Capital Economics. The 214,000 increase in the ADP survey measure of private sector employment in February, up from 193,000 the month before, is another illustration (as if any more were needed) that the economy isn\u2019t rolling over. The turmoil in financial markets, which has most recently begun to fade, obviously didn\u2019t stop employers hiring last month. The breakdown shows that most of those gains (+208,000) were in the services sector, with construction adding +27,000. Manufacturing employment fell by 9,000. Just in: American companies took on more new workers than expected last month. ADP, the US outsourcing group, reports that 214,000 new private sector jobs were created in February, beating forecasts of 190,000. That suggests that Friday\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll, the eagerly-awaited health-check on the US labour market, might not be bad news. Economists are expecting that the NFP will rise by 195,000, leaving the jobless rate at an eight-year low of 4.9%. We shouldn\u2019t get carried away by the recent recovery in the stock markets. Anxiety about the global economy may have eased a little, helped by the prospect of another dose of stimulus from central banks. But the underlying problems still aren\u2019t fixed - from the unbalanced nature of the world economy to the debt piles built by advanced economies, and the slide towards deflation. Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, the French bank, reckons this means the optimism in the markets won\u2019t last. Michael Lewis\u2019 grumble in The Big Short is, I think, that more crooked bankers weren\u2019t sent to gaol, yet his book and the film show that the problem was an excess of fools more than an excess of crooks. But what surprised me in the period after 2008, was that the world\u2019s economic leaders didn\u2019t push for debt destruction or forgiveness, but chose instead to use monetary policy to create enough inflation to deflate the debt away. In a global economy with excess supply of goods, and one where the marginal cost of supply of many services is infinitesimally small, I can\u2019t see why we should escape disinflation any time soon. And that\u2019s why the risk rally will be a short-lived affair. After that early surge, shares in London have been dipping back. As the lunchtime dash to the sandwich shop approaches, the FTSE 100 is now down 18 points at 6134 - partly dragged down by ITV. The other European markets are still up, though, having hit one-month highs this morning. Broadcaster ITV isn\u2019t getting much love from the City this morning. Its shares have fallen over 3%, despite posting a decent rise in profits this morning. It may just be profit-taking, but there\u2019s also some anxiety about sales growth - ITV says ad revenue will be flat until the European Football hits the screens. It\u2019s a better morning for Virgin Money - the challenger bank that is being built from the remains of Northern Rock. It quadrupled its pre-tax profits in 2015, helped by decent demand for mortgages. But investors in Entertainment One, which owns the rights to Peppa Pig, are squealing after seeing its shares slide 12% to the bottom of the stock market fallers. It reported a 3% fall in revenues for the last nine months of 2015, dragged down by a 14% slide film revenues. But don\u2019t worry, kids! Retail sales still look strong, as Sky News explains: Retail sales were expected to show a rise of 275%, with toys up 230% and clothes 300% ahead, the company said. Canada and France are next in line for a Peppa retail launch. Markets in South East Asia and China were continuing to develop and expected to see strong growth in the next financial year. Entertainment One\u2019s TV revenues were up 39% but film was down 14% reflecting tough market conditions, fewer film releases than the year before and \u201csome recent title underperformance\u201d. This rather pretty chart shows that the City is bracing for the pound to be rather volatile this summer, around the EU referendum (on 23rd June) The copper price has hit a three-month high today - another signal that economic demand is picking up. Copper on the London Metal Exchange is up 1.55 per cent to $4,789 a tonne, the highest level since November. In Shanghai copper rose 2.7 per cent to 36,820 yuan a tonne (that\u2019s via the FT). Today\u2019s stock market rally highlights a surprising fact - miners have been the best-performing shares in 2016. Europe\u2019s natural resources companies are up around 5% this year, while the wider market has lost 7%. Quite a decent recovery - until you remember that some miners lost two-thirds of their value during 2015. Uncertainty over Britain\u2019s EU referendum could be hurting the UK construction industry. Mike Chappell, global corporates managing director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, explains: The conversations I\u2019ve had with those in the industry over the past month have been largely positive and many will be surprised to see a dip in the PMI reading. \u201cCommercial construction is increasingly buoyant, while in infrastructure sentiment is also positive, in spite of a number of key projects taking longer than expected to break ground. The reality is contractors are used to such delays and are otherwise comforted by the positive rhetoric suggesting improving the UK\u2019s infrastructure is a long-term priority. \u201cThe great unknown, however, remains Brexit. Many construction firms generate the bulk of their revenues in the UK but also rely on a steady stream of skilled workers from the EU. They are therefore considering how a vote to leave the union might impact these current arrangements.\u201d This might dampen the mood a little. Growth across Britain\u2019s construction sector has hit a 10-month low in February, due to a drop in housebuilding. Building firms interviewed by data firm Markit reported : Slowest rise in overall construction output since April 2015 Residential building work is the weakest performing category of activity Jobs growth moderates to a 21\u20442 year low And that dragged Markit\u2019s construction PMI down to 54.2 last month, down from 55.0 in January, showing slower growth. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, says builders lost optimism last month. Aside from the pre-election slowdown last year, the latest upturn in construction output was the weakest for over-two- and-a-half years. \u201cSurvey respondents noted that underlying business conditions remained favourable, especially in relation to commercial building and infrastructure-related work, but some clients had been hesitant to commit to new projects so far in 2016. Reflecting this, new order growth weakened again and construction firms were the least optimistic about their year-ahead growth prospects since December 2014. And this chart shows how housebuilding (blue line) slowed. Anything above 50 points indicates growth, though. Over in the Treasury, a light may be flashing away on George Osborne\u2019s desk. And that\u2019s because shares in Lloyds Banking Group have hit 73.8p this morning. That\u2019s just above the point where the government can sell its stake in Lloyds. Chancellor Osborne was forced to suspend his selloff of Lloyds shares to the public last month, because its share price has shrivelled below the \u2018break-even\u2019 point. But if shares cling onto today\u2019s level, the sale could soon be on again! Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9, European Central Bank board member, has dropped a clear hint that the ECB will ease monetary policy this month. Speaking in Frankfurt, C\u0153ur\u00e9 said it was \u201cvital\u201d to stimulate economic growth and push inflation up, after seeing prices fall by 0.2% in January. Some analysts are concerned that the ECB could harm the banking sector by cutting borrowing costs again - it already imposes negative rates on banks. But C\u0153ur\u00e9 argued that banks should accept ultra-low interest rates, as the alternative is poor economic growth. \u201cWe have seen from the recent sharp fall in bank equityprices that the sector is highly sensitive to a weaker-than-expected economic outlook In that context, our commitment to our price stability mandate is vital to anchor expectations of nominal growth.\u201d The global rally has also reached Istanbul, pushing Turkey\u2019s stock market to its highest level since the start of December. London Capital Group analyst Ipek Ozkardeskay says encouraging economic data from America is luring money back into shares. The French and German markets both up around 0.8% this morning, mirroring the rally in London. It\u2019s early days (!), but March is proving to be a better month for shares than January or February. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the situation: Rising a further 30 points after the bell the FTSE has already tentatively touched the 6200 mark for the first time since the end of 2015. That is a marked improvement on the barrel-scraping 3 and a half year lows seen in the middle of last month, the UK index arguably aided by the somewhat volatile, but gradually steadying, oil prices, Brent Crude slipping around a 0.5% but still hovering around the $36.50 per barrel level with the latest US crude oil inventories to come this afternoon. The Eurozone indices, meanwhile, are similarly buoyant; the DAX, approaching 9800, is at its highest point since the start of February. Risk sentiment is on the up in the markets today, says Chris Weston of IG, sparked by the strong rally on Wall Street last night. Weston identifies several technical reasons behind the optimism: The Bloomberg US financial conditions index is about to turn accommodative for the first time in 2016. Bloomberg incorporates the S&amp;P 500, VIX, various credit spreads, the US dollar and money market spreads into this index. This will fill the Federal Reserve with confidence. VIX measures volatility in the markets, and is known as the \u2018fear\u2019 index. Credit spreads show the difference between the yield on risky and less risky assets - they\u2019ve narrowed recently, which means a greater appetite for danger. The London stock market has hit its highest level since New Year\u2019s Eve 2015, as the global rally reaches Europe. In early trading, the FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares has gained 39 points to 6192, following those strong gains in Asia overnight. It\u2019s not been this high since 31 December, when the blue-chip index closed at 6,242 points. Mining shares are leading the rally, with copper producer Antofagasta up over 4%. That suggests City investors are taking heart from encouraging manufacturing data from the US yesterday. They\u2019re also probably betting on fresh central bank stimulus in China and the eurozone (which has just fallen back into deflation). Michael Hewson of CMC Markets believes investors are taking confidence from recent rises in commodity prices. They suggest demand for energy and metals may be picking up again, after some hefty falls last year. The continued rebound in commodity prices is all the more welcome given solvency concerns about some of the more leveraged firms in the sector. The recovery in copper, iron ore and oil prices has been a key arbiter in the rebound seen in mining and oil and gas stocks over the past few weeks, and the recent recognition by Chinese authorities that steps need to be taken to cut back on the overcapacity in the sector do appear to have also helped sentiment. Those cutbacks could see around 6 million Chinese workers laid off in the next couple of years. Switzerland has also smashed growth forecasts this morning. Swiss GDP rose by 0.4% in the October-December quarter, compared to forecasts of just 0.1%. It shows Switzerland did better than expected after the shock of January 2015, when it broke its currency peg and allowed the Swiss franc to soar against the euro Economists had feared this would hurt exports badly and drive Switzerland into recession. But as Cornelia Luchsinger, an economist at Zuercher Kantonalbank, says: \u201cA year ago no one would\u2019ve thought 2015 would wind up being as good as it was.\u201d Australia has helped drive shares higher today, by releasing stronger-than-expected growth figures. Australian GDP rose by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2015, meaning the economy grew by 3% during the last year. That beat forecasts, suggesting that the slowdown in the commodity market has caused less grief than feared. Here\u2019s the full story: China\u2019s stock market has posted its best day since November, despite credit rating agency Moody\u2019s threatening to downgrade the country\u2019s credit rating. The Shanghai Composite has just closed 4% higher, amid hopes that Beijing policymakers will take more steps to stimulate the economy. Shares in property developers led the surge, helped by reports that house prices in China are picking up, according to Reuters. It\u2019s quite a rally, given Moody\u2019s began the day by cutting the outlook on China\u2019s credit rating from stable to negative. Moody\u2019s warned that Beijing\u2019s finances would come under strain if it was forced to take on the liabilities from troubled state-owned companies. It also questioned whether the Chinese government was really committed to economic reforms. Marie Diron, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, told Bloomberg Television that: \u201cThe government\u2019s ability to absorb shocks has diminished and we want to signal this in the negative outlook.\u201d Pertinent questions, given the recent capital outflows out of China which prompted the yuan to be devalued. But it didn\u2019t hit the mood in Asia, where shares hit a two-month high. A stunning session in Asia has sent Japan\u2019s Nikkei index surging by 4%. A burst of renewed confidence helped investors to drive the Tokyo market up to its highest level since 8 February. It was a broad-based rally too, with 220 of the 225 companies on the Nikkei gaining. ground. And shares across Asia hit their highest levels in two months. Anxiety about a possible global recession appear to have eased, a little, giving traders a new appetite for risk. Stefan Worrall, director of Japan equity sales at Credit Suisse, told Reuters: \u201cFollowing the selloff and the fears of recession that emerged early in the new year, people pulled back aggressively from their previous expectations about how a rate hike from the Federal Reserve might unfold, \u201cSuddenly some of this lost confidence has been restored as we\u2019ve seen a lot of recent economic data from the U.S. beating expectations.\u201d Hopes of future economic stimulus from the European Central Bank, and the People\u2019s Bank of China, are also helping the mood. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. City traders can leave their tin hats at home today, because shares are going up. Wall Street set the mood last night, where shares rallied after stronger-than-expected construction and manufacturing data. The Dow Jones industrial average surging by 2% - its biggest one-day move since January. And the Nasdaq posted its best day in six months. Asia has picked up the baton with a strong session, helped by decent growth figures from Australia. And European shares are going to follow, adding to yesterday\u2019s gains (which saw the FTSE 100 hit its highest levels since the start of January). After a scary start to this year, investors seem to have regained some confidence about economic prospects, financial conditions, and the slowdown in emerging markets. How long that lasts is another issue.... On the Agenda.... There\u2019s a bit of economic data to look forward to, and a couple of central bank speeches too. 8:30am GMT: ECB executive board member Beno\u00eet C\u0153ur\u00e9 is speaking in Frankfurt 9:30am: The Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI will show how Britain\u2019s builders fared in February 10:00am: Bank of England deputy governor Ben Broadbent is speaking in London 1.15pm: The ADP jobs report shows how many private sector jobs were created in America last month 3.30pm: The US Department of Energy reports new Crude Oil Inventory figures And on the corporate front, the City are getting results from broadcaster ITV, transport group Stagecoach and financial group Virgin Money.",

A volatile oil price did not help. Early gains for the crude price reversed sharply in the wake of higher than expected US stocks. But then investors noticed the oil update also showed a fall in US production, which helped lift the crude price once more, as did talk that Saudi Arabia was negotiating a possible $10bn loan.

      "bodyText": "Shares in ITV were among the worst performers on the FTSE 100, despite rising profits, a special dividend and ever-present speculation of buyers waiting in the wings. Shareholders were handed a one-off windfall of 10p a share, or \u00a3400m overall, on top of the full-year dividend of 6p, itself a 28% increase on last year\u2019s payout. The increased dividend was possible thanks to an 18% rise in pre-tax profits during 2015 to \u00a3843m, on revenues that grew 15% to \u00a32.97bn. The efforts by ITV\u2019s chief executive, Adam Crozier, to reduce reliance on the fragile advertising market also bore fruit, with income from its fast-growing ITV Studios arm 33% higher at \u00a31.2bn. The group derives 49% of revenue from sources other than advertising as it closes in on Crozier\u2019s target of at least 50%. ITV\u2019s share price has risen more than 300% since the former chief of the Football Association and Royal Mail took over in 2010 with the stock languishing at about 50p. But they fell back 3.5% to 243p on Wednesday, underperforming nearly every other blue-chip stock, as investors focused on disappointing viewing figures. ITV said it had suffered a 3% decline in the audience share for its stable of channels over the year, as some of its showpiece programmes failed to delight viewers. One of these was Jekyll and Hyde, which sold well abroad but underperformed in the UK, amid a flood of complaints about violent scenes in which characters were bludgeoned and burned. But the company said viewers were already coming back, with ITV enjoying a 5% increase in audience share for its main channel so far in 2016 and a 2% increase across all its channels. The broadcaster expects advertising revenue to be flat in the first quarter, due to the difficulty of repeating the 12% growth in the first three months of 2015. But the European football championships this summer are expected to provide a shot in the arm for income from advertising in the second quarter. Crozier has made ITV Studios the central pillar of his strategy for ITV, pouring money into organic growth and acquisitions inan attempt to generate cash by selling popular TV shows around the world. Its American division reported a 36% increase in revenues to \u00a3320m, making ITV the biggest independent maker of unscripted shows, such as reality TV, in the US. Its growing profile has fuelled perennial rumours that ITV will be taken over by a US media giant such as the cable tycoon John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global. Liberty owns a stake of just under 10% in ITV, which analysts said meant it was in \u201cpole position\u201d to do a deal and could probably block any other suitors. \u201cThey\u2019ve got 398m shares, so at the current price that\u2019s about \u00a3930m,\u201d said Steve Clayton, a media analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cYou don\u2019t put more than $1bn into something on a whim. If they buy just over 0.1% more, they can prevent anyone else buying it. They\u2019ve got a tank parked on the lawn and it\u2019s not clear who else could realistically challenge.\u201d He added that the UK market was \u201cunfinished business\u201d for Malone, despite his \u00a315bn takeover of Virgin Media in 2013. Crozier, speaking on a conference call with analysts, said ITV was more focused on continuing an acquisition spree that has helped fuel the growth of ITV Studios. \u201cOur business is growing very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, we are a consolidator of companies. Given our increasing scale and volume as a company, I think that is the best form of defence, just to keep doing what we are doing.\u201d ITV\u2019s recent acquisitions have included Talpa, producer of The Voice, for \u00a3355m. The deal means that the broadcaster will wrest control of the popular singing contest programme from BBC next year. Its US expansion has also been built partly on acquisition, including a $360m (\u00a3256m) deal for Leftfield, whose programmes include the Real Housewives of New Jersey. ITV was bullish about its prospects later this year. It expects revenues from ITV Studios and its online and digital division to grow by double-digit percentages and to outperform the wider advertising market by airing programmes such as Victoria, a drama about the long-reigning monarch, and the revival of comedy drama series Cold Feet. The popularity of such shows abroad will be key, given that 53% of revenue in ITV Studios now comes from outside the UK. Its growing international business should also reduce the company\u2019s sensitivity to UK audience share, which was the focus of negative sentiment around the 2015 results. While UK revenues in ITV Studios were up 19% to \u00a3547m and US sales grew 36% to \u00a3320m, income from the rest of the world more than doubled to \u00a3213m. Sir Peter Bazalgette, who presided over the launch of Big Brother as chairman of Endemol, will take over from Archie Norman as chairman in May. His appointment has led to speculation that the company is preparing for Crozier\u2019s possible departure after six years in the role.",

One of these was Jekyll and Hyde, which sold well abroad but underperformed in the UK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/29/itv-jekyll-and-hyde-investigation-complaints-ofcom\">amid a flood of complaints</a> about violent scenes in which characters were bludgeoned and burned.</p> <p>But the company said viewers were already coming back, with ITV enjoying a 5% increase in audience share for its main channel so far in 2016 and a 2% increase across all its channels.</p> <p>The broadcaster expects advertising revenue to be flat in the first quarter, due to the difficulty of repeating the 12% growth in the first three months of 2015. But the European football championships this summer are expected to provide a shot in the arm for income from advertising in the second quarter.</p> <p>Crozier has made ITV Studios the central pillar of his strategy for ITV, pouring money into organic growth and acquisitions inan attempt to generate cash by selling popular TV shows around the world.</p> <p>Its American division reported a 36% increase in revenues to \u00a3320m, making ITV the biggest independent maker of unscripted shows, such as reality TV, in the US. </p> <p>Its growing profile has fuelled perennial rumours that ITV will be taken over by a US media giant such as the cable tycoon John Malone\u2019s Liberty Global. Liberty owns a stake of just under 10% in ITV, which analysts said meant it was in \u201cpole position\u201d to do a deal and could probably block any other suitors.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got 398m shares, so at the current price that\u2019s about \u00a3930m,\u201d said Steve Clayton, a media analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. \u201cYou don\u2019t put more than $1bn into something on a whim. If they buy just over 0.1% more, they can prevent anyone else buying it. They\u2019ve got a tank parked on the lawn and it\u2019s not clear who else could realistically challenge.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the UK market was \u201cunfinished business\u201d for Malone, despite his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/06/virgin-media-takeover-john-malone-liberty-global\">\u00a315bn takeover of Virgin Media</a> in 2013.</p> <p>Crozier, speaking on a conference call with analysts, said ITV was more focused on continuing an acquisition spree that has helped fuel the growth of ITV Studios. \u201cOur business is growing very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anything, we are a consolidator of companies. Given our increasing scale and volume as a company, I think that is the best form of defence, just to keep doing what we are doing.\u201d</p> <p>ITV\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/12/itv-the-voice-producer-talpa-media-john-de-mol\">recent acquisitions have included Talpa</a>, producer of The Voice, for \u00a3355m. The deal means that the broadcaster will wrest control of the popular singing contest programme from BBC next year.</p> <p>Its US expansion has also been built partly on acquisition, including a $360m (\u00a3256m) deal for Leftfield, whose programmes include the Real Housewives of New Jersey.</p> <p>ITV was bullish about its prospects later this year. It expects revenues from ITV Studios and its online and digital division to grow by double-digit percentages and to outperform the wider advertising market by airing programmes such as Victoria, a drama about the long-reigning monarch, and the revival of comedy drama series Cold Feet. The popularity of such shows abroad will be key, given that 53% of revenue in ITV Studios now comes from outside the UK.<br></p> <p>Its growing international business should also reduce the company\u2019s sensitivity to UK audience share, which was the focus of negative sentiment around the 2015 results. While UK revenues in ITV Studios were up 19% to \u00a3547m and US sales grew 36% to \u00a3320m, income from the rest of the world more than doubled to \u00a3213m.</p> <p>Sir Peter Bazalgette, who presided over the launch of Big Brother as chairman of Endemol, will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/16/sir-peter-bazalgette-itv-chairman\">take over from Archie Norman</a> as chairman in May. His appointment has led to speculation that the company is preparing for Crozier\u2019s possible departure after six years in the role.</p>",

    "webTitle": "No breakup at Rolls despite activist investor on board, says chairman", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of Rolls-Royce has insisted the engineering group will not be broken up despite appointing the chief operating officer of ValueAct, the activist US investor, to its board. Rolls has named Bradley Singer as a non-executive director and a member of its science and technology committee, giving him a front row seat from which to see the company\u2019s latest innovations. The California-based fund had been lobbying Rolls behind the scenes for a seat on the board since the final quarter of last year and there were fears that it could push the company into breaking itself up. ValueAct revealed seven months ago that it was building a shareholding in Rolls and it now owns 10.8%, making it the biggest shareholder. However, Ian Davis insisted Rolls would not split off its largest businesses. Asked whether ValueAct was pushing for a breakup, he said: \u201cThey have not and we will not break the company up.\u201d Rolls has issued five profit warnings in the last two years and cut its dividend for the first time in 24 years. It is understood that ValueAct plans to use Singer\u2019s position on the board to gather more information about the company and will then decide whether to propose the sale of any assets. The investor was attracted to Rolls by its intellectual property and market-leading position, but believes it can help the engineering group to become more efficient. Rolls has five divisions \u2013 civil aerospace, defence aerospace, marine, nuclear, and power systems. The civil aerospace business, which makes engines for the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, is widely considered to be the most lucrative part of Rolls. The company has struggled due to defence spending cuts by western governments, a fall in demand for corporate jets, and customers in the energy industry cutting investment. Sir John Rose, who led Rolls from 1996 to 2011, led the diversification of the company into sectors outside its core aerospace business, such as marine. However, this led to Rolls pulling out of the market for single-aisle aircraft, which critics claim is at the heart of the company\u2019s problems given the booming market for short-haul aircraft. Although Davis ruled out a breakup of Rolls, he admitted the company could make smaller asset sales. Warren East, who took over as chief executive of Rolls last summer, is trying to turn the company around by cutting up to \u00a3200m of costs a year, which he hopes will make the engineer more nimble. ValueAct is thought to back this strategy. Singer insisted he was \u201cdeeply impressed\u201d by the senior team at Rolls and their \u201ccommitment to improving their operations to match the company\u2019s world-class product portfolio and engineering capabilities\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is a privilege to be joining the board and I look forward to working closely with the board members and management team as they execute their plans for sustained long-term success.\u201d The agreement between Rolls and ValueAct means the investor will lose its seat on the board if it takes its shareholding above 12.5% or below 7.5%. ValueAct will also be blocked from calling shareholder meetings, proposing a merger or takeover of Rolls, proposing changes to strategy or management, and publicly criticising the company. ValueAct must also vote in favour of resolutions proposed by the board at Rolls\u2019 annual meetings. The terms of the deal, revealed in a document published by Rolls alongside the announcement about Singer\u2019s appointment, will last until its annual shareholder meeting in 2018, although they could be extended. The Rolls chairman said that Singer had an \u201coutstanding record\u201d as a business leader and had been appointed after a rigorous selection process. \u201cHe has a deep understanding of institutional investors in the US, which is very important to Rolls,\u201d he added. However, Davis admitted that ValueAct\u2019s shareholding in Rolls had been the \u201ccatalyst\u201d for the appointment. Shareholders will vote on the appointment at Rolls\u2019 annual meeting in May. Davis said he expected investors to back the appointment, after canvassing their views. \u201cThe vast majority are neutral or positive,\u201d he said. Davis said he had spoken to the UK government about the appointment. The government has a \u201cgolden share\u201d in Rolls due to its involvement in key defence projects, such as the UK\u2019s collection of nuclear submarines. \u201cThe UK government is a shareholder and I have talked to all shareholders on this,\u201d he said. The appointment at Rolls comes after East sent a memo to staff last year describing activist investors as mostly \u201ccapitalists seeking the opportunity of a business in some kind of transition\u201d. However, Davis said the phrase \u201cactivist investor\u201d was \u201cemotive\u201d and actually represented a \u201cbroad\u201d collection of groups, with ValueAct at one end of the spectrum and focused on long-term investments. ValueAct has pressed for changes at 75 companies since Jeffrey Ubben launched the firm in 2000. It helped to engineer the departure of Steve Ballmer as the chief executive of Microsoft and has taken seats on the board at roughly half the companies it invested in. The fund seeks to distinguish itself from aggressive US activists such as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman, who use public campaigns to pressurise boards into doing their bidding. ValueAct portrays itself as a low-key, long-term investor, working more like a private equity firm to improve a company\u2019s performance over many years. ValueAct holds investment in 12 companies, with Rolls the only company it bought into last year. ValueAct researched the engineer for three years before making the investment. Before joining ValueAct, Singer was the chief financial officer of Discovery Communications and American Tower Corp. He also worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs in London and New York.",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest fund manager, BlackRock, has warned that a Brexit vote would damage Britain\u2019s economy by leading to lower growth and investment, and possibly higher unemployment and inflation. In a gloomy analysis, the US asset manager said a decision to leave the EU would also hit the pound and UK equities, as well as damaging Britain\u2019s financial industry, the London property market and the fashion industry. BlackRock\u2019s wide-ranging warning is a sign of the growing unease among investors about the Brexit debate. A number of leading business figures have spoken in favour of the UK remaining in the EU. This week, the Cabinet Office warned of 10 years of uncertainty in the government\u2019s first official analysis of how Brexit would unfold in practice. But the out campaign, backed by the London mayor, Boris Johnson, likened such extreme warnings to those made when Britain considered joining the euro. BlackRock\u2019s vice-chairman, Philipp Hildebrand, said: \u201cOur bottom line is that a Brexit offers a lot of risk with little obvious reward. We see an EU exit leading to lower UK growth and investment, and potentially higher unemployment and inflation. Any offsetting benefits look more amorphous and less certain, in our view.\u201d The report said sterling was most vulnerable to Brexit fears. \u201cA Brexit could pressure the UK\u2019s budget and current account deficits, hurting the currency and potentially triggering credit downgrades. Conversely, we see depressed sterling bouncing back if the UK votes to stay.\u201d It predicted rising volatility in UK and European assets in the run-up to the referendum in June, and a sell-off in domestically focused UK equities in the event of a Brexit vote. A decision to leave the EU would also hurt the UK\u2019s fashion trade, deals for the key services sector, and damage London\u2019s property market, in particular demand for office space. Turning to the City, the report argued: \u201cA Brexit would cut into the financial industry\u2019s outsized contributions to the UK economy, tax revenues and trade balance, we believe, and offset apparent fiscal gains from leaving the EU.\u201d The UK\u2019s surplus in financial, insurance and pension services of \u00a318.5bn was likely to shrink, BlackRock added. The City is also a key source of Britain\u2019s tax revenues, and if 10% of workers lost their jobs after a Brexit, the government could lose up to \u00a33bn in annual employment taxes and, to a lesser extent, for the rest of the EU. No country has ever left the union, and Brexit talks could drag on for several years. Senior figures from the out campaign were likely to demand leading roles in the exit negotiations, which could make the process \u201cunpredictable and destabilising\u201d. A Brexit could also encourage the Scottish National party to call for another independence referendum, although the oil price slump has undermined the case for an independent Scotland. Even a yes vote might not be enough to ward off political turmoil. The report argued that a tight result, or a feeling by out campaigners that it had not been a fair fight, could put further pressure on David Cameron\u2019s small parliamentary majority and authority over his divided party. This could make it more difficult to pass controversial legislation in future. There would be a negative impact on the EU as well. The report said: \u201cThe EU, for its part, would lose a major budget contributor, a leading voice for free markets and easy access to a world-class financial centre. A Brexit could spur separatist calls and embolden populist parties across the continent, but we do not see a EU breakup as a result.\u201d One of the report\u2019s authors is BlackRock\u2019s chief macro strategist, Rupert Harrison, a former chief of staff to the chancellor, George Osborne.",

      "bodyText": "Poundland shares have slipped back as the discount retailer announced that chief executive Jim McCarthy was retiring after a decade in the job. The company said McCarthy would be succeeded in April by Kevin O\u2019Byrne, former chief executive at DIY group B&amp;Q., who joins as the business faces a number of challenges. Poundland has grown from 146 stores to 900 in Britain, Ireland and Spain under McCarthy\u2019s tenure, and it recently bought rival 99p Stores for \u00a355m after a protracted competition enquiry. But sales growth has slowed in a tough high street environment as the company integrates and rebrands the 99p estate, and profits are expected to fall in the full year. Poundland\u2019s shares have dipped 5p to 176.3p but analysts were generally positive about the succession plan. David Mccarthy at HSBC said: Jim McCarthy\u2019s retirement will be a disappointment, but is not a surprise. The succession plan appears well thought out. Jim will be leaving after the 99p Stores integration is completed in April, and Kevin O\u2019Byrne will benefit from the tailwind of synergy benefits flowing through in the following year or so, while he gets firmly established. Credit Suisse issued an outperform rating on the shares with a 250p price target and said: We understand that Jim wanted to retire at 60 and the appointment suggests that search has been underway for some time. The change in the management comes at a time when the company is going through a period of significant change, and we think this might lead to some near term uncertainty around strategy. Poundland is about halfway through the integration of the 99p estate, but much work remains to integrate back office/supply chain. Key decisions on international strategy (Spain rollout) are pending. The rollout of a new multi-price format is about to kick off, and while the core Poundland offer now includes considerably more conditional multi-price offers, so decisions need to be taken on the acceleration of this transformation as well as steps to address the structural challenges (high street exposure) and the cost base (labour). Clive Black at house broker Shore Capital said We shall, naturally, be interested to see how Mr. O\u2019Byrne\u2019s plans for Poundland evolve. The group has been through considerable change recently, which continues apace with the...conversion of the 99p Stores estate. That change, particularly embodying the ridiculous phase II investigation by the Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA), to our minds\u200e, sterling strength until recently against the euro and a tough UK market, burdened by weak high street footfall, has brought some pressure upon Poundland\u2019s P&amp;L in recent times; note: Poundland has not updated on its recent business performance in this update, which leads us to believe that the company still expects to deliver underlying profit within the guidance provided on the 7 January third quarter update. However, whilst so, we believe that once the company has a single Poundland fascia and platform then a tight management team can press on with energising a high intensity and impulsive business, build out the opportunity in the UK and Ireland, grow online and make a decision on the future in Iberia. All these considerations take place within a business that has a strong balance sheet, noting the leasehold nature of the group.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s construction industry put in its worst performance for 10 months in February after the slowest rise in housebuilding since the summer of 2013. Concerns that the economy is slowing, difficulties in finding skilled staff and the prospect of Britain leaving the EU helped restrict activity across the sector last month. The Markit/Cips UK construction purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) registered 54.2 in February, down from 55.0 in January, the lowest figure since last April. Although still above the 50.0 value that separates expansion from contraction, Markit said the latest reading pointed to one of the weakest rises in construction output seen over the past two-and-a-half years. The figures came a day after the Labour MP Clive Betts, the chair of the local government committee, said the failure of the big housebuilders to speed up development was simply designed to maximise their profits. Betts said planners were doing their bit, giving the green light to plots for 475,647 homes in England that have yet to be built. Last year, more homes were built in the UK than at any time since 2008, but the MP said: \u201cIt is clear that the big developers are building at a rate to maximise their profits rather than addressing the country\u2019s housing need.\u201d Tim Moore, a senior economist at Markit, said that while construction firms remained in expansion mode, the loss of momentum in the residential building sector was marked. \u201cSurvey respondents noted that underlying business conditions remained favourable, especially in relation to commercial building and infrastructure-related work, but some clients had been hesitant to commit to new projects so far in 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cReflecting this, new order growth weakened again and construction firms were the least optimistic about their year ahead growth prospects since December 2014.\u201d He said the growth in jobs slipped back to levels seen in 2013, as did the level of stock building, which is usually high when companies expect orders to rise. Mike Chappell, a construction specialist at Lloyds\u2019 commercial arm, said anecdotal evidence showed that the industry was recovering from a dip last year. \u201cThe conversations I\u2019ve had with those in the industry over the past month have been largely positive and many will be surprised to see a dip in the PMI reading,\u201d he said. \u201cCommercial construction is increasingly buoyant, while in infrastructure, sentiment is also positive, in spite of a number of key projects taking longer than expected to break ground. The reality is [that] contractors are used to such delays and are otherwise comforted by the positive rhetoric suggesting improving the UK\u2019s infrastructure is a long-term priority. \u201cThe great unknown, however, remains Brexit. Many construction firms generate the bulk of their revenues in the UK, but also rely on a steady stream of skilled workers from the EU. They are therefore considering how a vote to leave the union might impact these current arrangements.\u201d",

The UK\u2019s biggest advertiser-funded broadcaster on Wednesday reported a 15% increase in revenue to \u00a32.97bn last year, despite a 3% decline in audience share for its TV channels. ITV still posted 6% growth in TV ad revenue to \u00a31.72bn. But the biggest growth came from production arm ITV Studios, up 33% to \u00a31.24bn; and online, pay and interactive, up 23% to \u00a3188m. However, despite its strong results and an upbeat forecast for 2016 overall, investors took fright after ITV said it expected ad revenue to be flat in the first three months of the year before picking up in the second quarter with the European Championship, with the share price falling 3% in early trading. The broadcaster said it would return \u00a3400m to shareholders with a special dividend of 10p a share in addition to a final dividend of 4.1 Non-TV advertising revenues, including production, online and sponsorship, grew 25% to \u00a31.66bn, though this figure includes \u00a3441m of \u201cinternal supply\u201d \u2013 money ITV Studios makes from commissions for the broadcaster\u2019s own channels, such as Coronation Street. Excluding this figure, non-TV ad revenue accounted for 42% of the total external figure, up from 37% in 2014, as the strategy of the ITV chief executive, Adam Crozier, of diversifying the business away from traditional TV advertising continued to make progress. ITV Studios revenues exceeded \u00a31bn for the first time, with 53% coming from outside the UK. Growth was driven partly by further acquisitions in the TV production sector, including The Voice producer Talpa for \u00a3355m and Twofour, the company behind The Jump and Educating Yorkshire. The company has also recently completed the \u00a3100m acquisition of UTV Media\u2019s TV business, including the ITV franchise for Northern Ireland and Irish TV channel UTV Ireland. ITV said the cash cost of its 2015 acquisitions was \u00a3406m.",

      "bodyText": "With the week\u2019s market rally continuing, Lloyds Banking Group has passed the break even price on the government\u2019s stake for the first time this year, paving the way for further share sales by the chancellor. In early trading the shares breached the 73.6p level, the average government purchase price, and hit 73.8p before slipping back to 73.38p, a 0.31p rise. In October chancellor George Osborne unveiled plans to sell a \u00a32bn stake in the bank to the public - billed as the biggest privatisation for 20 years - when the share price was nearly 78p. But in January he postponed the move after the stock market turbulence during the first weeks of the year, particularly in the banking sector where investors became concerned about the outlook for profits as well as the effect of negative interest rates on the sector\u2019s balance sheets. The government has been gradually cutting back its stake, from 43% to less than 10%, but Osborne is unlikely to revived the public offer until after the EU referendum in June. But if the shares remain above the break-even level for a sustained period, he may well decide to edge down the stake by selling in the market or to institutions. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The continued recovery in the banking sector has seen Lloyds Banking Group shares move back closer to its 73.6p level breakeven price, increasing the prospects that we could well see the government look to pare down its remaining stake in the bailed out bank. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor, said: Lloyds bank has reached the magic 73.6p, average government purchase price, for the first time this year. The slump in share price had caused George Osborne to postpone the proposed sale of their last tranche of Lloyds shares. If the share price stabilises above their breakeven level, this opens the door for the Chancellor to resume the share sale, which would be welcome news for both the Government and prospective investors. Overall the FTSE 100 has continued its revival, up 21.31 points to 6174.19. But it has come off its best levels after weaker than expected UK construction data. Mining companies continue to benefit from recent Chinese measures to stimulate the economy, with Antofagasta adding 15.1p to 505.5p and BHP Billiton 20.8p better at 761.2p. Positive results have lifted Virgin Money, up 27.5p to 367.76p, but testing group Intertek has dropped 98p to \u00a329.06 after final results saw a 3.5% rise in revenues to \u00a32.1bn but a loss after a \u00a3577m impairment charge on past acquisitions. Oil and gas services group Amec Foster Wheeler has jumped more than 6% to 414.8p after it announced the completion of a \u00a31.7bn refinancing. Analysts at Haitong said the shares were being lifted by the news and strength in the crude price but added: Full year results are due on March 10. We see a risk that that company may be forced to write down a significant portion of the goodwill associated with the Foster Wheeler acquisition at these results. We are a buyer of this stock so our message is use any weakness that may ensue from 2015 results to pick this stock up.",

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce has appointed a representative of ValueAct Capital to its board after months of lobbying by the US activist hedge fund for the company to improve its performance. Bradley Singer, ValueAct chief operating officer, will join the board of the Derby-based engineering company immediately as a non-executive director and also be a member of its science and technology committee. ValueAct bought a 5.5% stake in Rolls-Royce last July, making it the company\u2019s largest shareholder, and said it wanted to work with the company to improve its performance. The San Francisco-based fund increased its stake to 10.8% in November as it stepped up pressure for board representation. Rolls-Royce has issued a string of profit warnings before and after ValueAct bought its stake and earlier this month cut its dividend for the first time in 24 years, when it was reported that the company was preparing to appoint a representative to its board. Warren East, who took over as chief executive in July, has said the group is bloated and cumbersome, making it too slow to react to market changes. The company has also been affected by cuts to defence budgets, falling demand for corporate jets in emerging markets and plunging oil prices that have forced energy companies to reduce spending. East has said he is content with Rolls-Royce\u2019s range of businesses, which include making marine engines and reactors for nuclear submarines. In discussions with the company and shareholders, ValueAct has played down any immediate desire to split off those businesses from the core aerospace division, the FT reported. After early reluctance, the Derby-based group became more open to appointing a director from ValueAct, whose co-founder, Jeffrey Ubben, has helped engineer corporate shakeups such as the departure of former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer. ValueAct has pressed for changes at 75 companies since Ubben launched the firm in 2000. But the fund seeks to distinguish itself from aggressive US activists such as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman, who use public campaigns to pressurise boards into doing their bidding. ValueAct portrays itself as a low-key, long-term investor working more like a private equity firm to improve a company\u2019s performance over many years.",

      "bodyText": "A subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, which wants to build Australia\u2019s largest coalmine, has been accused by its own lawyer in India of fraud, illegal land purchases and other violations over a solar project. The allegations emerged in an order by the Madras high court, ironically after Adani sought to gag the lawyer over what it claimed was a blackmail attempt to get paid more. Justice KK Sasisharan issued the injunction against the lawyer Kabilan Manoharan, who allegedly threatened to \u201cpublicise illegalities\u201d around a Tamil Nadu solar power plant, Indian website The News Minute reported. But the judge\u2019s order revealed the \u201cfraudulent and illegal acts\u201d alleged by Manoharan in a letter to Adani. In a reply to the lawyer, Adani denied it had engaged in any wrongdoing. The 648MW solar plant, which would be the largest in the world, is being built by Adani Green Energy, a 51%-owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises. Adani Enterprises is also the parent company of Adani Mining Australia, the proponent of the $16bn Carmichael coal project in Queensland\u2019s Galilee basin. Sasisharan reportedly noted there was a prima facie case for blackmail against Adani\u2019s lawyer, in view of its argument that all the information it shared with him was subject to legal client privilege. The court order stated that his allegations included that Adani was involved in illegal land purchases, as well as submitting fraudulent documents to gain a power purchase agreement with a Tamil Nadu utility, which was later used to gain bank loans worth 23b rupees (A$470m). Manoharan also accused Adani of violating Indian stock market regulations by \u201cnon-disclosure of material information\u201d. He reportedly told Adani in the letter that \u201cno amount of political patronage will ever be able to sweep under the carpet the illegalities, non-compliance and surreptitious circumvention of procedure in the bid to meet (Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation) specification\u201d. A spokesman for Adani Mining Australia was contacted for comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The global super rich continued to splash out on super-yachts and luxury goods last year, despite a decline in their overall wealth in the wake of financial market turmoil. According to the latest wealth report from estate agents Knight Frank, published on Wednesday, sales of super-yachts \u2013 boats longer than 24 metres \u2013 soared 40% in 2015, with the rich roaring off to ever more far-flung destinations, such as the Antarctic and outposts in Asia, rather than their traditional ports of call in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. The number of ultra rich \u2013 people with $30m (\u00a322m) or more in assets \u2013 fell 3% last year. There are now 187,500 with assets in excess of that benchmark, down from from 193,100 in 2014. This was the first decline since the financial crisis. Between them, they controlled $19.3tn in assets, down from $22tn the year before. This reflected the rollercoaster global stock markets, the slump in commodity prices and slowing economic growth in China and other countries. The number of dollar millionaires around the globe also fell from 13.6 million in 2014 to 13.3 million last year. Together, they hold assets worth $66tn \u2013 more than the value of all global shares added together. But the report believes that the decline in the number of millionaires is just a blip, and predicts that by 2025, there will be more than 18 million of them. So-called investments of passion such as art, cars, stamps and jewellery remain popular among the super rich. Knight Frank\u2019s art index rose by a muted 4% last year, but a number of records were set in the world\u2019s auction houses. Pablo Picasso\u2019s Les Femmes d\u2019Alger notched up a new record for a painting sold at auction after fetching more than $179m, while Reclining Nude by Amedeo Modigliani went under the hammer for $170m to a buyer from Shanghai. Classic cars increased by 17% in value last year, while coins went up 13%. Knight Frank\u2019s overall luxury investment index rose 7% in 2015. This compares with a 5% drop in the value of London\u2019s leading share index, the FTSE 100, and a rise of just 1% for prime London residential property. Andrew Shirley, the editor of the wealth report, said: \u201cAlthough no classic car managed to beat the record set by Bonhams in 2014 when it auctioned a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Berlinetta for $38m, eight of the 25 cars ever to have sold for over $10m at auction went under the hammer in 2015.\u201d Wine and luxury watches both posted 5% increases. A Hong Kong-based billionaire set a record for a gem or piece of jewellery when he paid $48.4m for the Blue Moon, a rare fancy vivid blue diamond auctioned by Sotheby\u2019s in Geneva in November. The day before, he paid $28.5m for a vivid pink diamond sold by Christie\u2019s. The value of investment-grade Bordeaux wines slumped as a result of a sharp fall in demand from China, but they have now started to recover, said Nick Martin of Wine Owners. Even furniture values, which generally had a poor year, set a new auction record for a living maker when the Lockheed Lounge sofa by the Australian designer Marc Newson sold for \u00a32.4m in April 2015.",
