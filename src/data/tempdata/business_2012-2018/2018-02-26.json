      "bodyText": "The latest detailed data employment data has revealed that in 2017 full-time median earnings rose by less than inflation as the low wages growth problem flowed through all segments of employment while at the same time the levels of casualisation continue the trend upwards. Last year, median full-time earnings was $65,577 \u2013 a 1.5% increase on the $64,584 recorded in 2016. But that 1.5% growth in the 12 months to August last year was below the 1.8% increase in inflation in the 12 months to September. This marked the third year since 2012 that full-time median earnings had not kept pace with inflation: Partly the cause is the increase in the number of women working full-time. Women as a general rule earn less than men even when working full-time. Across Australia, median full-time earnings for men is 13% higher than for women. Last year the median full-time earnings for women was $61,724 compared with the men\u2019s $69,784. The biggest difference was in Western Australia, where male full-time median earnings of $78,000 was 20% above women\u2019s $65,000 median: And thus when more women move into full-time work, it lowers the overall median full-time income. But even when we look at the growth of median earnings by gender and by full-time or part-time status, we see that growth in 2017 was well below the average that occurred from 2005 to 2012, when the wages growth began to fall to the current near record low levels: Only the median earnings for part-time women saw an increase above the 2005-2012 average \u2013 and even that only occurred after two years where there was no increase at all. These annual figures also allow us to compare the difference between average earnings and median ones, to show just what \u201cmiddle Australians\u201d are earning. Because high incomes skew average earnings higher, talking of average earnings as \u201cmiddle incomes\u201d gives a distorted picture \u2013 which is helpful when suggesting for example that raising the second-highest income tax level from $80,000 to $87,000 was helping such middle Australia. Such was the case when Malcolm Turnbull in 2016 argued that \u201cmiddle-income Australians, those that are on average full-time earnings, which as you know is nudging $80,000 ... \u201d. And he is right about full-time average earnings \u2013 they are currently $84,661, but \u201cmiddle-income Australians\u201d are earning nowhere near $80,000, let alone the new threshold of $87,000. In 2017, the median full-time earnings in people\u2019s main job (thus excluding those who work more than one job) was $65,577, and for all workers \u2013 both full-time and part-time \u2013 the median earnings was $52,988: The data also shows that the biggest gaps between men and women\u2019s full-time earnings occur at high incomes. While the median full-time income for men is 13% higher than the median for women, the amount earned by men among the top 10% is nearly 20% more than is earned by the top 10% of women working full-time: Because of the higher proportion of women working part-time the gap is accentuated when looking at overall earnings. The median earnings for men of $62,400 is a third higher than the $46,800 median earnings for women. The biggest earnings disparity occurs in the professional, scientific and technology industry, while the smallest gap occurs in the public administration and safety industry \u2013 reflecting the better gender diversity hiring practices within the public sector. The data also showed that the level of casualisation remains a growing concern. Whereas throughout the first decade of this century the percentage of women working casual slowly fell, since 2012 it has been on the rise. As the level of men working casual has been rising for 25 years, this has meant that the overall level has risen since 2012 from 23.5% of all employees to 25.1% last year \u2013 the equivalent of around 155,000 more workers being employed on a casual basis: Casual workers are also more likely to be employed in industries with lower skill levels. For example not one of the industries with above-average levels of employees with bachelor degrees or five years\u2019 worth of industry experience has above average numbers of casual workers. Such workers are also much more likely to be working on weekends, with 30% of all casual employees working both weekends and weekdays, compared with 21% of employees who are employed with leave entitlements: But for all workers, casual or not, the latest data only serves to reinforce how stagnant living standards have been over the past five years and will only add fuel to fire of the debate over how to solve the problem.",

      "bodyText": "Ahead of a testimony from new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday, investors appear to have got over their fears of interest rate hikes, helping markets to regain their poise after the early February slump. With Wall Street adding to last weeks gains, Europe was on the front foot for most of the day. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 45.17 points or 0.62% higher at 7289.58 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.35% to 12,527.04 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.51% to 5344.26 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.15% 22,706.21 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.81% higher at 9902.4 But in Greece, the Athens market slipped 0.84% to 837.04 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 279 points or 1.1% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Commenting on Draghi, Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: Speaking today, Mario Draghi stuck to his view that continued accommodation was necessary, and this was enough to drive the euro sharply lower against the US dollar, catching a few overeager euro bulls on the hop. Clearly the ECB is in no rush at all to taper further. \u2018Sufficient unto the day\u2019 would appear to be the message that this central banker is sending. Of course, the big event is still to come this week, as the new Fed chairman appears before US lawmakers. Draghi\u2019s dovishness is a given, but Mr Powell is something more of an unknown quantity. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, added: Mario Draghi...stated inflation in the currency bloc is still conditional on the stimulus programme. Mr Draghi has a track record of leaving the door open to additional monetary easing, and it sounds like he hasn\u2019t changed his ways. A final string of questions, including: Is monetary policy the only main tool for the recovery? Draghi: No, you must be tired of hearing this, I have been saying it for five years, structural reforms are of key importance. How can we avoid currency wars? Draghi: there is no currency war, the worries of the governing council are about increasing volatility which might cause an unwanted tightening of financial conditions in the eurozone. Question about Greece\u2019s inflation not being on target. Draghi says the longer and more dramatic the recessession, the slower the rate of inflation getting towards its target. The improvement in the situation should strengthen the belief the objective will be reached. But the ECB target is not individual country\u2019s inflation target but the eurozone as a whole. And the session concludes. Question on non performing loans at banks. Draghi says the case for tackling NPLs in a determined way is clear. Banks with high stock of NPLs have given less credit to the economy, high NPLs mean less support to firms and households, harming growth. Question: will QE need to be pursued further than 2018 if targets not met. Draghi says the possible extension of QE has not been discussed by the governing council. What I have been saying, in the presence of an improving economic situation, we need the right blend of three features. We are more confident that inflation is proceeding towards our objective, but we have to be persistent and patient. Headline inflation is still not within our objective, that will be key measure of monetary policy in coming months. The effects of monetary policy have been produced by several measures, one is net asset purchases, another is the stock of assets accumulated by the ECB. The governing council will keep on reinvesting bonds that come to maturity for a length of time after end of QE. Guidance on interest rates is very important, and the \u201cwell past\u201d comment is very important. Question about Draghi\u2019s controversial membership of G30 group and what he will say to ombudsman. Draghi says we have taken note of ombudsman letter and will provide an answer by the allotted time, in April. Question on failure of Latvian bank. Draghi says he won\u2019t comment on details of emergency liquidity assistance to the bank, shortly before it failed. Another question on Greece\u2019s performance. Draghis says, almost all agreed prior actions have been implemented, just two left, expected to be completed in next two weeks. Question on Greece, and whether a fourth programme will be needed. Draghi says, lot has been done at Greece, but certain prior actions need to be taken place in the next two weeks. At the ECB we didn\u2019t discuss further programmes. Supplementary question on a bubble in asset prices causing the financial crisis. Draghi says expansive monetary policy is one way of explaining the financial crisis. Another is the dismantling of existing financial legislation. Expansionary policy is required by our mandate so the last thing we want to see is the dismantling of existing legislation. Question on including house prices or all asset prices in the ECB\u2019s inflation measurements. Draghi says our primarily objective is to hit the inflation target, our focus on consumer prices can best preserve the purchasing power of the people in the euro area. We assess asset prices, for example on wealth effects and financial conditions. Question on the appointments to the ECB board, and the fact there are no women on the board. Draghi reads out the articles of the treaty about appointments. Then he adds, diversity and gender diversity is one of strategic priorities, we are aiming to do more than we have achieved so far. Question on the US tax reforms. Draghi says US tax reforms will support the US and US corporates, but it is too early to say if the spillovers will be significant for the euro area. It will reshape the tax landscape in the world. The implications are complex. We have seen money outflows from European corporates to US corporates. For the time being we are observing these flows but it is hard to say what the long term consequences are. On the financial effects of Brexit, he says the EU should finalised clearing measures ahead of Brexit: Let me also stress the crucial importance of finalising the adoption of key pieces of EU legislation... well in advance of Brexit, in order to be prepared for all possible contingencies, including a no-deal scenario. Failing to do so could leave central banks and supervisors without the appropriate tools to handle the risks.. Delayed plane flights is the explanation for the late start to the Mario Draghi session at the European parliament, explains the chair of the economic committee Roberto Gualtieri. So he will skip his opening remarks, and will also keep questions short after Draghi\u2019s speech, which belatedly gets underway. Draghi concludes by repeating calls for further policy measures: Our monetary policy measures have had tangible benefits for the euro area economy. Further policy initiatives are however needed to reduce vulnerabilities, strengthen resilience in crisis situations and increase growth potential. Only ambitious policies will deliver concrete benefits for the people of Europe. Europe is growing more strongly than expected but inflation is yet to show sustained signs of moving higher, says Mario Draghi. Ahead of the ECB president\u2019s address to the European Parliament, the bank has released his opening statement. He said: A comprehensive analysis by the Eurosystem has concluded that adverse cyclical factors have played a crucial role in explaining low underlying inflation. These notably consisted of dampened economic activity and high unemployment in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis, and subsequently subdued foreign demand and low oil prices. Yet, these factors are of a temporary nature and should not affect inflation over a medium-term horizon, even though they might impact on the speed of adjustment in inflation. He added: Overall, the analysis indicates that the relationship between growth and inflation remains largely intact, even if it has temporarily weakened in recent years to the extent that the speed of adjustment in inflation towards our aim has been affected. Looking ahead, we anticipate that headline inflation will resume its gradual upward adjustment, supported by our monetary policy measures. At the same time, uncertainties continue to prevail. In particular, the recent volatility in financial markets, notably also in the exchange rate, deserves close monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. Therefore, while the strong momentum of the euro area economy has clearly strengthened our confidence in the inflation outlook, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy is still needed for inflation to sustainably return to levels of below, but close to, 2%. In fact, the evolution of inflation remains crucially conditional on an ample degree of monetary stimulus provided by the full set of our monetary policy measures: our net asset purchases, the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and our forward guidance on policy interest rates. ECB president Mario Draghi is due to start his testimony shortly: US markets have opened higher, ahead of a key testimony by new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday. Hopes that Powell will keep the Fed on a steady course have helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 153 points or 0.6% in early trading. Meanwhile the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.46% higher and the Nasdaq Composite 0.5% better, helped by a rise in technology shares. As we wait for ECB president Mario Draghi, here\u2019s more on US interest rates. Federal Reserve member James Bullard says he is concerned about the central bank going too far, too fast on interest rates unless the data supports it. And he adds: He also indicated he was not overly concerned about the recent stock market volatility, and he did not think it meant investors were re-thinking the prospects for growth in either the US or globally. Here\u2019s our latest on the Melrose bid for GKN, which is likely to hot up this week. Karl West reports: The hostile \u00a37.4bn battle for control of GKN, one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering groups, is expected to come to a head this week as the aerospace and auto parts manufacturer reports annual results, which could prompt a raised bid from predator Melrose. GKN is scrapping for its life after rejecting the offer from Melrose, a corporate turnaround firm that specialises in buying unloved industrial assets, improving the financial returns and selling for a huge premium. Melrose has offered 1.49 of its own shares, plus 81p for every one of GKN\u2019s shares. The mainly share-based bid would leave GKN investors with 57% of the enlarged group. Simon Peckham, the chief executive of Melrose, is confident he can pull off a coup and break GKN\u2019s resistance. \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening in the market \u2013 our shares are going up and theirs are tracking ours,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s their job to explain to investors why they think they are the best management for the business. Their shareholders haven\u2019t told us to go away.\u201d Melrose is expected to raise the stakes following GKN\u2019s results on Tuesday. It is thought the buyout firm may have to sweeten its offer by raising GKN investors\u2019 holding to about 65% of the merged group. The full story is here: The strength of the pound in the wake of weekend comments from the Bank of England\u2019s Dave Ramsden - it is currently up 0.5% at $1.4034 against the dollar - is not limiting the gains in the FTSE 100. The leading index is up 0.55% at 7284, near the highs of the day. Meanwhile European markets are shrugging off a stronger euro, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.39% and France\u2019s Cac climbing 0.55%. Forecasts of a stronger opening on Wall Street are helping. After the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed a late spurt on Friday to end the day 347 points or 1.39% higher, the futures are indicating an opening gain of around 169 points. But the outlook for the euro and therefore European markets could be determined later when European Central Bank president Mario Draghi testifies before the European Parliament. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, said: The ECB has long been preparing the markets for the end of bond buying and recent statements, minutes and comments from Draghi himself have indicated that the central bank intends to give plenty of warning of upcoming changes leading many to expect such a warning in the not too distant future. Draghi may therefore drop further hints on the timing of such a policy shift in today\u2019s hearing which the euro will be particularly sensitive to. It\u2019s another bad morning for hundreds of Carillion workers. The Official Receiver has announced that another 230 employees have been made redundant, following its collapse last month. In happier news, the Receiver has managed to save an extra 456 jobs by finding new suppliers to take on Carillion\u2019s public and private sector contracts. Over the last month, 8,066 jobs have been saved and 1,371 jobs have been made redundant. That means that roughly half of Carillion\u2019s 19,000 workers still face uncertainty, The Receiver is hopeful that more jobs can be saved, saying: Discussions with potential purchasers continue and I expect that the number of jobs safeguarded through the liquidation will continue to rise. I am continuing to engage with staff, elected employee representatives and unions to keep them informed as these arrangements are confirmed. The French economic recovery is gathering pace, says UBS Wealth Management, which has just raised its forecasts for the eurozone\u2019s second-largest member. UBS now expects the French economy to grow by 2.3% this year, up from 1.8% previously. In 2019, it now expects GDP to rise by 2%, up from an earlier forecast of 1.6%. A year ago, investors were fretting that far-right candidate Marine Le Pen might become France\u2019s new president. Things look brighter today, says Dean Turner, Economist at UBS Wealth Management: \u201cAlong with the rest of the Eurozone, the outlook for the French economy has improved sharply. The risks around last year\u2019s presidential elections now seem like a distant memory. \u201cFollowing his election and subsequent parliamentary landslide, Emmanuel Macron\u2019s willingness to embark on his ambitious program of domestic structural reforms has led to a renewed confidence in the outlook for the economy. The current sense of optimism amongst French firms should mean that investment continues to rise, and the outlook for hiring remains positive.\u201d Back in the markets, shares in outsourcing group Interserve have slumped by almost 10% today. Interserve provides services to the UK government across health, education and defence. It has been under tight scrutiny since the collapse of Carillion last month. According to the Sunday Telegraph, Interserve\u2019s banks are reluctant to back a crucial debt refinancing deal, having already suffered big losses following Carillion\u2019s liquidation. Interserve is hoping to persuade creditors to agree new loans lasting up to five years, to replace emergency funding that expires at the end of March. It has denies that talks with creditors have \u2018stumbled\u2019. The UK cabinet office has been watching Interserve closely, and denied that the company could be \u2018the next Carillion\u2019. Financial commentator Frances Coppola tweets: Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, reckons that some certainty over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU would help the housing market. He writes: \u201cThe UK Finance numbers are quite encouraging as they bear out what we have been seeing on the ground - in other words, buyers and sellers are getting on with business, albeit at more realistic prices. Certainly we don\u2019t see any signs of fireworks but nor do we see any major corrections in the market either. Looking forward towards the spring market, we hope for a little bit of better news on the Brexit front which would give more certainty to the market and more balance of supply and demand in this crucial period for the housing market.\u201d Although mortgage approvals rose in January, the amount of money borrowed by UK businesses actually shrank last month. This morning\u2019s report from UK Finance shows that firms owed \u00a3263.9bn to Britain\u2019s high street banks in January - 1.4% less than a year ago. As this chart shows, UK businesses have been trimming their debts over the last few months. That may be another sign that firms are cautious about committing to new projects while Brexit remains uncertain. Despite January\u2019s pick-up in mortgage approvals, 2018 is likely to be a tough year for the UK housing market, says Howard Archer of EY. He predicts that the threat of interest rate rises, and weak consumer confidence, means that prices will only rise by 2% this year. If so, that might help some first-time buyers scramble onto the property ladder. Archer writes: The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain challenging. Consumers have faced an extended squeeze on purchasing power, and it is likely to ease only gradually as the year progresses. Additionally, housing market activity is likely to be hampered by fragile consumer confidence and limited willingness to engage in major transactions. House buyers will also likely be concerned about further interest rate hikes this year following November\u2019s first tightening of monetary policy by the Bank of England since 2007. While the increase in interest rates was just 0.25% and mortgage rates are still at historically very low levels, there does appear to have been some impact on house buyers\u2019 psychology. We expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates twice in 2018 (each time by 0.25%), with the next move likely in May. Economist Rupert Seggins shows how UK mortgage approvals and house price growth are both weaker than a few years ago: Today\u2019s figures also show that more people remortgaged their homes last month. They may be looking to \u2018lock in\u2019 today\u2019s low interest rates, before the Bank of England raises borrowing costs. Simon French of Panmure Gordon predicts that this trend will continue, especially as a May hike is looking more likely.... Here\u2019s a chart showing how UK mortgage approvals (in green) rose in January after cooling towards the end of 2017. Breaking: British mortgage approvals have risen, for the first time in four months. Some 40,117 mortgage loans were approved in January, new industry figures show. That\u2019s an increase on December\u2019s 36,085 -- which was the weakest since April 2013. However, this is still down on January 2017, when 44,259 mortgages were agreed with lenders. The pound is gaining ground this morning, after a senior Bank of England policymaker hinted that interest rates will rise soon. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden told the Sunday Times that: \u201cRelative to where I was, I see the case for rates rising somewhat sooner rather than somewhat later\u201d. That\u2019s significant, as Ramsden opposed last November\u2019s interest rate hike, meaning he\u2019s seen as a dovish member of the Monetary Policy Committee. Traders have driven sterling up by 0.5% this morning, or three-quarters of a cent, to $1.4042. Some City experts believe the Bank will hike interest rates, currently 0.5%, in May. Kit Juckes, foreign exchange expert at Societe Generals, says that \u201cDave the Dove\u201d has helped the pound overcome \u201cthe usual depressing Monday morning Brexit headlines\u201d. Every major European share index has risen this morning, pushing the pan-European Stoxx 600 index up by 0.6%. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: The DAX was the region\u2019s most robust index, surging nearly 1% to tickle 12600 for the first time since February 7th, while the CAC posted a respectable, 5350-crossing 0.7% increase. It\u2019ll be interesting to see whether Mario Draghi\u2019s testimony in Brussels changes the day\u2019s cheery sentiment. Last year\u2019s brutal hurricane season and other natural disasters wiped more than 90% of insurance firm Hiscox\u2019s annual profits. The Lloyd\u2019s of London firm, which provides cover for anything from burst water pipes to hurricane damage and kidnappings, said 2017 had been a \u201chistoric year for catastrophes\u201d. The industry as a whole footed a $140bn bill \u2013 the worst year ever for natural disasters. Hiscox\u2019s pretax profits shrank to \u00a330.8m from \u00a3354.5m in 2016. Its London market cut premiums by 20% but is now raising them following last year\u2019s hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria battered the Caribbean and US Gulf coast in a month. Hiscox shares fell 8% in early trading and are now down almost 5% at \u00a313.29. \u201cMarket pricing has improved and as a consequence we have growth ambitions for every part of our business,\u201d said chief executive Bronek Masojada. Some solid corporate results are pushing the London stock market higher this morning. Associated British Foods shares are up 1.5% after it told the City that profits at its Primark fashion chain are expected to accelerate over the next six months. Business supplies company Bunzl have inched up 0.3% after reporting a 13% rise in profits for the last year. Mining companies are also helping to keep the FTSE 100 up this morning. They\u2019re rallying because the US dollar has weakened today (which pushes up commodity prices). Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, Head of Investment at interactive investor, says: Equity markets in the UK and Europe are off to a good start, following on from a late surge in the US on Friday and a positive start to the week in Asia. Britain\u2019s biggest shopping centre owner Hammerson is adding adventure games and mini golf centres to its malls, after reporting a 6.8% rise in profits to \u00a3246m last year. The owner of the Bullring in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London is focusing on providing \u201cexperiences\u201d to draw shoppers in, such as ice-skating in the winter and a beach in the summer. Hammerson has just signed up Escape Hunt, which offers games where players solve a crime story or mystery, at Cabot Circus in Bristol and Martineau Galleries in Birmingham. Hammerson\u2019s chief executive David Atkins brushed aside talk of the death of the mall. He told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. \u201cAround 85% of all retail sales do still touch a physical store, so we\u2019re very firmly of the view that the physical store has a genuine place to play.\u201d Hammerson said 98.3% of its space was occupied, a 17-year high. \u201cOur portfolio is focused on the better, bigger shopping centres and we try and provide more than just retail by offering experiences for our shoppers that provide more than just the physical shops,\u201d Atkins added. The company is letting about 40% of its space to fashion, down from 60% a few years ago. At the same, space taken up by leisure and dining has gone up by a third to 14%. A Hammerson spokeswoman explained there was less space allocated to cheaper \u201cfast fashion\u201d (with the notable exception of Primark) while shops selling \u201cathleisure\u201d were taking more space. The chief executive of Bank of Ireland has warned that the uncertainty over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union is hitting business confidence. Bank of Ireland restored its dividend this morning, for the first time in a decade, after posting an underlying profit of \u20ac1,078m last year. But while it hasn\u2019t suffered any \u2018material\u2019 hit from Brexit, it can see that companies in Ireland are nervous. CEO Francesca McDonagh told Reuters that some firms, particularly smaller ones, are holding back from investment until they know how Brexit will pan out. McDonagh said: \u201cWhile uncertainty remains for our UK business, we\u2019ve seen nothing material today with regards to asset quality, there\u2019s nothing that gives us concern. \u201cFor our customers in Ireland, there is an element of uncertainty, particularly for smaller businesses. We do see that two out of three business customers intend to invest in their businesses in the coming years but some of them are applying a wait and see approach.\u201d The UK government says it\u2019s committed to avoiding a \u2018hard border\u2019 with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. However, it\u2019s not clear how this can be achieved if Britain leaves the Single Market and the customs union. Research has shown that Ireland could be the EU member most badly affected by Brexit. Two weeks ago, taoiseach Leo Varadkar warned that achieving a frictionless Irish border was \u201cthe tricky bit\u201d of the Brexit talks.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Traders faced a chilly commute into the City this morning, as the Beast from the East brings a blast of icy weather - freezing fingers and causing some delays on the rail network... But once they get in, investors are expected to push stocks higher. The main European indices are all rising in early trading, as confidence returns to the markets after the wobbles earlier this month. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 0.5%, or 38 points, to 7278. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say: Equity markets are likely to continue benefitting from the strong economy and thus strong earnings growth despite higher bond yields acting as a drag on P/E ratios. Yet, with corporate bond yields still low, there seems no imminent risk for corporate funding, corporate profits and the economy as a whole. Today we find out how many UK mortgages were approved in January. Economists expect a small increase compared to December, when approvals hit a four-year low. Investors will also be listening out for any guidance from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, when he appears before MEPs later today. Draghi could be quizzed on Europe\u2019s economic recovery, and when the ECB will wind up its stimulus programme. The agenda 9.30am GMT: UK mortgage approval figures for January 2pm GMT: ECB president Mario Draghi testifies to the European Parliament in Brussels. 6pm GMT: Bank of England deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe speaks at Warwick University",

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A comprehensive analysis by the Eurosystem has concluded that adverse cyclical factors have played a crucial role in explaining low underlying inflation. These notably consisted of dampened economic activity and high unemployment in the aftermath of the sovereign debt crisis, and subsequently subdued foreign demand and low oil prices. Yet, these factors are of a temporary nature and should not affect inflation over a medium-term horizon, even though they might impact on the speed of adjustment in inflation. </p> </blockquote> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Overall, the analysis indicates that the relationship between growth and inflation remains largely intact, even if it has temporarily weakened in recent years to the extent that the speed of adjustment in inflation towards our aim has been affected. </p> <p>Looking ahead, we anticipate that headline inflation will resume its gradual upward adjustment, supported by our monetary policy measures. At the same time, uncertainties continue to prevail. In particular, the recent volatility in financial markets, notably also in the exchange rate, deserves close monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.</p> <p>Therefore, while the strong momentum of the euro area economy has clearly strengthened our confidence in the inflation outlook, patience and persistence with regard to monetary policy is still needed for inflation to sustainably return to levels of below, but close to, 2%. In fact, the evolution of inflation remains crucially conditional on an ample degree of monetary stimulus provided by the full set of our monetary policy measures: our net asset purchases, the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and our forward guidance on policy interest rates. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a941b42e4b05fe61cc6cddb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-26T14:36:00.414Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>ECB president Mario Draghi is due to start his testimony shortly:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/968130935467200513\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: ECB Draghi\u2019s Speaks To EP Committee On Economic And Monetary Affairs Approx. 14:40 GMT  <a href=\"https://t.co/QnhhiKinSd\">https://t.co/QnhhiKinSd</a></p>&mdash; LiveSquawk (@LiveSquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LiveSquawk/status/968130935467200513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a941a23e4b04a8523004c00\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-26T14:33:50.240Z\">2.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall Street opens higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>US markets have opened higher, ahead of a key testimony by new Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday.</p> <p>Hopes that Powell will keep the Fed on a steady course have helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average 153 points or 0.6% in early trading.

Total mortgage lending rose by 9.7% to \u00a321.9bn in January compared with the same month a year ago, according to UK Finance, the body that represents all the major high street banks. Much of the boost to mortgage lending is believed to have come from a cut in stamp duty, although the bounce-back comes from low levels, and total lending was still at its third lowest level since September 2016. But lending to businesses contracted by 1.4%, with construction falling. Spending on credit cards rose by 5.8%, or much faster than the growth in personal incomes, although the banks said that repayment levels on credit cards were also high. The figures suggest that borrowers are switching away from personal loans, which declined by 15% on the month, and preferring to borrow via their credit cards instead. Despite concerns about household over-indebtedness, the credit card companies continue to offer deals of up to 37 months interest-free. Deposits at banks and building societies advanced just 2% on the year, hitting a total of \u00a3835bn, with Isa products continuing to see outflows. UK Finance warned that the overall figures suggest that the UK economy is \u201csluggish\u201d. It said: \u201cWhile January figures showed an increase in consumer confidence and improvement in wage growth, the underlying long-term picture is pointing to sluggish growth. \u201cHouseholds are expected to continue to feel the squeeze on their finances, and therefore their propensity to spend, as real earnings, when adjusted for inflation, are still running well below the inflation rate. At the same time, household savings are declining as debt servicing costs, as a share of disposable income, rise.\u201d It warned that inflation will remain at elevated levels, which will keep consumer spending at subdued levels and restrain the outlook for economic growth. Meanwhile businesses are taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude to investing, as uncertainty around Brexit and growth continue to take its toll. UK Finance noted a discrepancy between business confidence, which is strong, and investment levels, which are sudued. Stephen Pegge of UK Finance said: \u201cBusiness sentiment remains positive with confidence in short-term trading conditions buoyed by the recovery in international markets. Investment levels remain broadly unchanged and borrowing continues to err on the side of caution, as companies adopt a \u2018wait and see\u2019 attitude to trading uncertainties, opting to use their deposits as buffers for spending decisions.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The hostile battle for control of GKN, one of Britain\u2019s oldest engineering groups, is expected to come to a head this week as it reports annual results, which could prompt an increased bid from Melrose. The aerospace and automotive parts manufacturer is fighting for its life after rejecting a \u00a37.4bn offer from Melrose, a corporate turnaround company that specialises in buying unloved industrial assets, improving the financial returns and selling for a huge premium. The offer consists of 1.49 new Melrose shares and 81p in cash for each GKN share. It would leave GKN investors with 57% of the enlarged group. Simon Peckham, the chief executive of Melrose, is confident he can pull off a coup and break GKN\u2019s resistance. \u201cLook at what\u2019s happening in the market \u2013 our shares are going up and theirs are tracking ours,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s their job to explain to investors why they think they are the best management for the business. Their shareholders haven\u2019t told us to go away.\u201d Melrose is expected to raise the stakes following GKN\u2019s results on Tuesday. It is thought the company may have to sweeten its offer by raising GKN investors\u2019 holding to about 65% of the merged group. In a letter to shareholders this month, Mike Turner, GKN\u2019s chairman, said: \u201c[We believe] that Melrose is more focused on financial engineering than real engineering.\u201d Last week, the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, wrote to the business secretary, Greg Clark, who has the power to call a public interest inquiry into the deal, expressing his concern over Melrose\u2019s bid. The outcome is hugely important to Britain. GKN can trace its roots back to 1759 with the founding of the Dowlais Ironworks in South Wales. Today, it operates in more than 30 countries and has 58,000 employees, including 6,000 in the UK. They work on a range of automotive and aerospace projects, including the Porsche 918 Spyder, Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Ariane 5 rocket. At a time when another government is working on an industrial strategy, damaging a UK-based group such as GKN could dent its ambition to bolster Britain\u2019s science and manufacturing base. Jeremy Corbyn said last week that he wanted to broaden the public interest test for takeovers and labelled Melrose an \u201casset stripper\u201d. The company denied this claim, saying it makes a large contribution to the UK economy. Last week, Melrose announced a full-year loss of \u00a327.6m, down from \u00a369.3m the previous year, and raised its dividend by 91%. Melrose\u2019s approach to GKN in early January was timed perfectly, because it caught its target at a low ebb. GKN had been left weakened by profit warnings in October and November, caused by problems in its aerospace division, where the company makes parts for the US F-35 fighter, Typhoon jet and A400M military transport aircraft. GKN\u2019s vulnerability was exacerbated by management turmoil after the departure of Kevin Cummings, the chief executive designate, following the second profit warning. The chief executive role had just been filled by Anne Stevens, a former chief operating officer at Ford, when Melrose made its move. Under a radical restructuring plan, Stevens said GKN would sell off its powder metallurgy division and hand back \u00a32.5bn to shareholders. It will also split itself into aerospace and automotive divisions. GKN insiders say splitting the businesses would make it easier for investors to value the automotive arm, which it believes is grossly undervalued by the market. However, the split could also pave the way for one or both divisions to be sold off to trade buyers. According to one well-placed investment banking source, GKN and the US group Spirit AeroSystems have flirted with each other for years. The source said in the event of a split, it would be far more likely that GKN will offload the aerospace business to Spirit, leaving the remaining automotive arm as a FTSE 100 standalone. If Melrose wins, sources at GKN expect it to sell off the automotive arm at a premium within a few years, followed by the aerospace division a few years later. This plan could see Melrose\u2019s senior management cash in with larger amounts than they have previously earned. Last year, the leading four executives at Melros received share-based bonuses worth about \u00a336m each. Investors face a choice between the short-term sweeteners plus longer-term promise of a more focused business offered by GKN, or the proven ability of Melrose\u2019s management team to make a fast buck. Melrose was co-founded in 2003 by Christopher Miller, the executive chairman, David Roper, the executive vice-chairman, and Peckham. They listed Melrose that year on Aim as a \u00a313m cash shell. Today, it is a FTSE 250 powerhouse with a market value of \u00a34.4bn.",

It is thought the company may have to sweeten its offer by raising GKN investors\u2019 holding to about 65% of the merged group.</p> <p>In a letter to shareholders this month, Mike Turner, GKN\u2019s chairman, said: \u201c[We believe] that Melrose is more focused on financial engineering than real engineering.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, wrote to the business secretary, Greg Clark, who has the power to call a public interest inquiry into the deal, expressing his concern over Melrose\u2019s bid.</p> <p>The outcome is hugely important to Britain.

The company denied this claim, saying it makes a large contribution to the UK economy. Last week, Melrose announced a full-year loss of \u00a327.6m, down from \u00a369.3m the previous year, and raised its dividend by 91%.</p> <p>Melrose\u2019s approach to GKN in early January was timed perfectly, because it caught its target at a low ebb. GKN had been left weakened by profit warnings in October and November, caused by problems in its aerospace division, where the company makes parts for the US F-35 fighter, Typhoon jet and A400M military transport aircraft.</p> <p>GKN\u2019s vulnerability was exacerbated by management turmoil after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/16/gkn-chief-executive-writedown-kevin-cummings\">departure of Kevin Cummings</a>, the chief executive designate, following the second profit warning.</p> <p>The chief executive role had just been filled by Anne Stevens, a former chief operating officer at Ford, when Melrose made its move. </p> <p>Under a radical restructuring plan, Stevens said GKN would sell off its powder metallurgy division and hand back \u00a32.5bn to shareholders. It will also split itself into aerospace and automotive divisions.</p> <p>GKN insiders say splitting the businesses would make it easier for investors to value the automotive arm, which it believes is grossly undervalued by the market.</p> <p>However, the split could also pave the way for one or both divisions to be sold off to trade buyers. According to one well-placed investment banking source, GKN and the US group Spirit AeroSystems have flirted with each other for years. The source said in the event of a split, it would be far more likely that GKN will offload the aerospace business to Spirit, leaving the remaining automotive arm as a FTSE 100 standalone.</p> <p>If Melrose wins, sources at GKN expect it to sell off the automotive arm at a premium within a few years, followed by the aerospace division a few years later.</p> <p>This plan could see Melrose\u2019s senior management cash in with larger amounts than they have previously earned. Last year, the leading four executives at Melros received share-based bonuses worth about \u00a336m each.</p> <p>Investors face a choice between the short-term sweeteners plus longer-term promise of a more focused business offered by GKN, or the proven ability of Melrose\u2019s management team to make a fast buck.</p> <p>Melrose was co-founded in 2003 by Christopher Miller, the executive chairman, David Roper, the executive vice-chairman, and Peckham. They listed Melrose that year on Aim as a \u00a313m cash shell. Today, it is a FTSE 250 powerhouse with a market value of \u00a34.4bn.</p>",

The chain is fighting back against competition from the likes of Franco Manca as well as the switch to takeaways via the likes of Deliveroo, in a tough business environment that has led a string of rivals in the casual dining sector to close restaurants. Zoe Bowley, managing director of Pizza Express, said the company has already tested customers\u2019 appetite for live music by revamping a site in central Birmingham in late 2016 and then making a significant investment at an outlet in Holborn in central London. Holborn hosted \u201cAudience with\u201d events with Goldie and Martin Kemp in 2017 and singer Gareth Gates performed there this weekend, while jazz-funk band Shakatak plays the Birmingham venue next month. \u201cIt\u2019s a cluttered market so what\u2019s critical is to remain differentiated,\u201d said Bowley. \u201cThe sector has moved on and everybody has upped their game but is casual dining a busted flush? Absolutely it isn\u2019t. Innovation is keeping the industry going.\u201d The Pizza Express Live venues will have dedicated performance spaces similar to the group\u2019s flagship Dean Street Jazz Club site which has been a music venue since 1976 hosting a string of names from Jamie Cullum and Benny Carter to Amy Winehouse, Norah Jones and Cybill Shepherd. The company is now reviewing all its sites with multiple floors to decide how many might be viable as a music venue. Acoustic live music nights, which Pizza Express currently operates in just over 20 restaurants, are also being expanded. Live music is a part of Pizza Express\u2019s history. Its founder, Peter Boizot, was a jazz lover hosting music from the 1970s at his former venue Pizza on the Park near Hyde Park in London which closed in 2010 and Kettner\u2019s in Soho as well as Dean Street. The group currently has five live venues including one in Maidstone, which has hosted music for 20 years, and the Pheasantry in Chelsea, London. The new venues may not necessarily host jazz, however. Birmingham and Holborn have put on comedy nights and a wide variety of acts including Spandau Ballet star Martin Kemp. \u201cWe sold a lot of [low calorie] Leggera pizzas and prosecco,\u201d says Bowley. She said well-known names such as Kemp, and former footballer-turned pundit Paul Merson, often brought with them a large social media following which ensured a packed venue. The group, which already has 477 restaurants in the UK, plans five new restaurants this year and Bowley said there were no plans for major closures. However, the company did sell off its Firezza delivery-based business late last year, less than two years after acquiring it, and several of those outlets have since closed. \u201cChristmas trading was particularly strong and January was slightly ahead of of expectations. We have been outperforming the market in the last quarter,\u201d she said. Pizza Express is rolling out its music plans at a time of flux for the restaurant trade. Jamie\u2019s Italian is closing 12 branches and is \u00a371.5m in debt, the Italian eatery Strada recently shut a third of its restaurants while rival Prezzo is now looking at restructuring. It\u2019s part of a casual dining crunch that has also seen the planned closure of almost a third of the Byron burger chain while the five-strong Square Pie group in London and Jamie Oliver\u2019s Piccadilly barbecue restaurant, Barbecoa, have both gone into administration.",

      "bodyText": "If the personal finances of every household could be ranked, the period following the 2008 financial crisis puts the baby boomer on top. There is a counterpoint to this, say campaigners for older savers, which is the level of interest rates over the period. Surely a decade of ultra-low rates favours borrowers and most of them are young. Likewise, final salary pension schemes, dominated as they are by the older generation, have struggled to bring down their deficits as low interest rates squeezed the return on assets. A report by the Intergenerational Foundation, a charity that funds research into issues that divide the generations, has found that far from losing out to younger people, baby boomers have proved themselves adept at ensuring they are the winners across many areas of public policy. Governments, say the authors, have been \u201ctempted by short-term pressures to set rates that clearly disadvantage the young and favour the older generations\u201d \u2013 compare university fees charged at an interest rate of 6.1% with the 2% the elderly are charged on loans to pay for residential care costs. Another example can be found in the rates of interest offered on state-sponsored savings bonds. The pensioner bond, which was launched by George Osborne and proved so popular it was credited with helping the Tories secure a majority in the 2015 general election, paid a 4% rate of interest. National Savings bonds for everyone else pay a maximum 2.2%. Worst of all is the huge bill in store for younger people in 30 or 40 years\u2019 time by virtue of the current calculations of future liabilities. Pension liabilities are top of the list, with public sector pensions in particular carrying a heavy cost. The foundation\u2019s concern is that the government overestimates the state\u2019s capacity to pay for future liabilities by exaggerating how fast the UK\u2019s income will grow over time. If GDP growth is forecast at an absurdly high rate then the income will supposedly be in place to pay generous pension payments in 30 years. If that growth fails to materialise, those who are in their 20s and 30s today will need to find large sums of cash to fill the hole when they are in their 50s and 60s. The debate centres on the discount rate, which is the calculation of a fund\u2019s long-term growth, which is used to reflect how much money should be set aside today to pay for tomorrow. Downgrade the discount rate by 0.5% and the government will need to set aside additional pension contributions worth 3% of salaries, it says. \u201cFrom this you can see very starkly why representatives of older workers have been lobbying strongly for higher discount rates. If they succeed in keeping discount rates 1% above what they should be, they have essentially transferred 6% of the total pension bill for each of these years from the old to the young, so the young will have to pay this bill,\u201d the authors say. So it is worth looking at how the discount rate is set. In a review orchestrated by Osborne in 2011, the Treasury said it should be aligned with expected GDP growth of 3%. When the GDP figures for subsequent years showed this to be wildly optimistic, the Treasury had a rethink and reduced it to 2.8%. Even at 2.8% it is a full percentage point above last year\u2019s growth rate. This year, when GDP growth is expected to be 1.5%, it is absurdly optimistic. In short, the pension contributions of teachers, nurses and police officers fail to account for how poor Britain will be in 2050 and the paucity of funds available to pay their pensions. The strike last week by university lecturers would appear to sit outside this debate. Like their local authority cousins, the university scheme is among the small band of public sector organisations that does not pay pensions out of whatever it can lay its hands on that year, as teachers and nurses pensions are, but from an investment pot built up over decades. The healthy lifestyles of most academics mean they (fortunately) live long lives. And with interest rates low, the university pension fund, the USS, has failed to build up a sufficient pot to cover an academic\u2019s extended retirement. Just short of 200,000 workers are affected. The USS deficit was \u00a39bn a year ago, but now stands at \u00a317.5bn, making it the largest on record at any British retirement fund. There are those who say the USS should copy the government and adopt a generous discount rate on its \u00a360bn fund. Then the fund\u2019s assets can be forecast to grow like Topsy, closing the gap with \u00a377.5bn of future pension payments. Pension rules on non-government funds are a bit stricter and so that\u2019s not so easily done. Instead, the USS has opted to follow the rest of corporate Britain and dump the problem on the young. To the untrained eye, that\u2019s not the case. Instead, it appears everyone is treated equally with all scheme members transferring to cheaper private pension plans, which depend for growth on stock market returns. But the young lecturer, with only a few years inside the guaranteed final salary scheme, is hit much harder than older academics, who will have their long years of service and entitlements in the USS protected. Such a proposal shows that sharing the problem of ballooning pension entitlements is alien to the baby boomer. Their representatives berate the Bank of England for maintaining low interest rates and when that doesn\u2019t work, reconstitute the pension scheme to the young\u2019s detriment. In the battle to maintain unaffordably generous schemes, and the USS is one example, the unions and Labour believe they are fighting the good fight, except they have failed on all fronts. The UK has found itself with a private pensions system that is dedicated to feathering the nests of the old, coupled with a public pensions system that will antagonise the young. Public sector pensions can only continue to pay out their commitments if inflated discount rates are imposed on the young, who will have to pay extra into their schemes over a 20- or 30-year period. All of this alongside paying their exorbitant university fees. The generational battle lines are drawn.",

Surely a decade of ultra-low rates favours borrowers and most of them are young.</p> \n<p>Likewise, final salary pension schemes, dominated as they are by the older generation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/aug/04/uk-interest-rate-cut-workplace-pension-schemes\">have struggled to bring down their deficits</a> as low interest rates squeezed the return on assets. </p> \n<p>A report by the Intergenerational Foundation, a charity that funds research into issues that divide the generations, has found that far from losing out to younger people, baby boomers have proved themselves adept at ensuring they are the winners across many areas of public policy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Governments, say the authors, have been \u201ctempted by short-term pressures to set rates that clearly disadvantage the young and favour the older generations\u201d \u2013 compare university fees charged at an interest rate of 6.1% with the 2% the elderly are charged on loans to pay for residential care costs.</p> \n<p>Another example can be found in the rates of interest offered on state-sponsored savings bonds. The pensioner bond, which was launched by George Osborne and proved so popular<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/feb/08/george-osborne-accused-buying-votes-pensioner-bonds\"> it was credited with helping the Tories secure a majority</a> in the 2015 general election, paid a 4% rate of interest. National Savings bonds for everyone else pay a maximum 2.2%.<br></p> \n<p>Worst of all is the huge bill in store for younger people in 30 or 40 years\u2019 time by virtue of the current calculations of future liabilities. Pension liabilities are top of the list, with public sector pensions in particular carrying a heavy cost.</p> \n<p>The foundation\u2019s concern is that the government overestimates the state\u2019s capacity to pay for future liabilities by exaggerating how fast the UK\u2019s income will grow over time. If <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economicgrowth\">GDP growth</a> is forecast at an absurdly high rate then the income will supposedly be in place to pay generous pension payments in 30 years. If that growth fails to materialise, those who are in their 20s and 30s today will need to find large sums of cash to fill the hole when they are in their 50s and 60s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"14f0fd6b-4543-4ffa-9c03-0398c9b698c8\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A deficit occurs when a salary-related pension scheme doesn't have enough assets to pay for all its future possible liabilities - ie, payouts to workers when they retire.</p>\n    <p><b>How is it measured?</b></p>\n    <p>There are different ways of measuring a deficit, which can result in widely different figures. However, it is a legal requirement to reduce any deficit over time. This requirement has changed a number of times in recent years as the government has tried to get the right balance between protecting members' future pensions and not putting so heavy a funding obligation on employers as to encourage them to close schemes, according to workSMART, a website run by the TUC.</p>\n    <p>Things that affect a scheme\u2019s funding position include contribution levels, investment returns (both those being achieved now and what experts forecast for the future), interest rates, inflation and life expectancy data.</p>\n    <p><b>What can be done to top up pension schemes?&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>Either the employer makes additional payments to narrow the deficit, or the trustees find other ways of reducing it, such as cutting benefits, upping member contributions or even shutting down the scheme so that workers can't carry on paying into it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The debate centres on the discount rate, which is the calculation of a fund\u2019s long-term growth, which is used to reflect how much money should be set aside today to pay for tomorrow.<br></p> \n<p>Downgrade the discount rate by 0.5% and the government will need to set aside additional pension contributions worth 3% of salaries, it says.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom this you can see very starkly why representatives of older workers have been lobbying strongly for higher discount rates. If they succeed in keeping discount rates 1% above what they should be, they have essentially transferred 6% of the total pension bill for each of these years from the old to the young, so the young will have to pay this bill,\u201d the authors say.</p> \n<p>So it is worth looking at how the discount rate is set. In a review orchestrated by Osborne in 2011, the Treasury said it should be aligned with expected GDP growth of 3%. When the GDP figures for subsequent years showed this to be wildly optimistic, the Treasury had a rethink and reduced it to 2.8%. </p> \n<p>Even at 2.8% it is a full percentage point above last year\u2019s growth rate. This year, when GDP growth is expected to be 1.5%, it is absurdly optimistic.</p> \n<p>In short, the pension contributions of teachers, nurses and police officers fail to account for how poor Britain will be in 2050 and the paucity of funds available to pay their pensions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/22/lecturers-begin-14-day-strike-over-pensions\">The strike last week by university lecturers</a> would appear to sit outside this debate. Like their local authority cousins, the university scheme is among the small band of public sector organisations that does not pay pensions out of whatever it can lay its hands on that year, as teachers and nurses pensions are, but from an investment pot built up over decades.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4421da00-4e0a-4598-bf2e-0a1cabe90cd9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Why are university staff striking?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>University staff who are members of the University and College Union are angry at proposed changes to their pensions, which they argue could leave them up to \u00a310,000 a year worse off when they retire. UCU say this would result in a loss more than \u00a3200,000 over the course of a retirement for a typical member of staff. Universities UK wants to change the <b>Universities Superannuation Scheme</b> from a defined benefit scheme \u2013 giving a guaranteed retirement income \u2013 to a defined contribution scheme, which would mean pensions would be subject to changes in the stock market. The union says young lecturers would be worst affected, with some losing up to half their pensions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the argument for the changes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Universities UK says its pension scheme has a \u00a36bn deficit and it have a legal duty to put in place a credible plan to tackle it by this summer. Without reform, pensions contributions would have to rise steeply \u2013 and would mean spending cuts in other areas such as teaching, student support and research. Universities UK says that even after the changes the scheme would compare well with employer contributions double the private sector average.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What about students?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>About 80,000 students at 30 of the universities affected have signed petitions. Many are supportive of striking staff but are demanding compensation for the hours of tuition they will miss because of the strikes. Students in England pay \u00a39,250 a year, and have rights under consumer law. Whether these rights apply to industrial disputes is untested.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The healthy lifestyles of most academics mean they (fortunately) live long lives. And with interest rates low, the university pension fund, the USS, has failed to build up a sufficient pot to cover an academic\u2019s extended retirement. Just short of 200,000 workers are affected.</p> \n<p>The USS deficit was \u00a39bn a year ago, but now stands at \u00a317.5bn, making it the largest on record at any British retirement fund. There are those who say the USS should copy the government and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/22/the-solution-to-university-pensions-better-fund-managers\">adopt a generous discount rate</a> on its \u00a360bn fund. Then the fund\u2019s assets can be forecast to grow like Topsy, closing the gap with \u00a377.5bn of future pension payments.</p> \n<p>Pension rules on non-government funds are a bit stricter and so that\u2019s not so easily done. Instead, the USS has opted to follow the rest of corporate Britain and dump the problem on the young. To the untrained eye, that\u2019s not the case. Instead, it appears everyone is treated equally with all scheme members transferring to cheaper private pension plans, which depend for growth on stock market returns.</p> \n<p>But the young lecturer, with only a few years inside the guaranteed final salary scheme, is hit much harder than older academics, who will have their long years of service and entitlements in the USS protected.</p> \n<p>Such a proposal shows that sharing the problem of ballooning pension entitlements is alien to the baby boomer. Their representatives berate the Bank of England for maintaining low interest rates and when that doesn\u2019t work, reconstitute the pension scheme to the young\u2019s detriment.</p> \n<p>In the battle to maintain unaffordably generous schemes, and the USS is one example, the unions and Labour believe they are fighting the good fight, except they have failed on all fronts. </p> \n<p>The UK has found itself with a private pensions system that is dedicated to feathering the nests of the old, coupled with a public pensions system that will antagonise the young. Public sector pensions can only continue to pay out their commitments if inflated discount rates are imposed on the young, who will have to pay extra into their schemes over a 20- or 30-year period. All of this alongside paying their exorbitant university fees. The generational battle lines are drawn.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8fe38a3d-cc39-4eb1-a24a-4f52f5decd72\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Gross domestic product (GDP) is a key government statistic and provides a measure of the UK's total economic activity.</p>\n    <p>Put simply, if GDP is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing; if it is down, it is contracting.

In the latest offensive in the war against plastic waste, the chain said it hoped the move, starting on Monday, would help change behaviour and encourage customers to switch to reusable cups instead. In the three-month trial, consumers buying hot drinks in takeaway cups in 35 selected London branches of Starbucks (including the City and West End) will have to pay an extra 5p. Baristas across the chain will also offer customers drinking in store a ceramic cup, cutting paper use further. Its research, published on Monday, revealed that almost half (48%) of consumers said they would definitely carry a reusable cup to avoid paying the extra 5p. The trial is being carried out with the environmental charity Hubbub, which will receive the proceeds of the levy and use it to fund further research. In January, MPs on the environmental audit committee called for 25p to be charged on top of the price of a hot drink, as concerns grow over coffee cup wastage. In the government\u2019s 25-year environment plan released that week, Theresa May announced a call for evidence into charges for single-use items. Disposable cups cannot be recycled by normal systems because they are made from cardboard with a tightly bonded polyethylene liner that is difficult to remove. As a result, just one in 400 cups are recycled \u2013 0.25%. Half a million coffee cups are dropped as litter each day in the UK. Although some coffee shops offer discounts for customers who bring their own cup, uptake of these offers remains low, at only 1 to 2% of purchases. Yet the impact of the plastic bag charge \u2013 which reduced bag usage by more than 83% in the first year \u2013 showed consumers were more responsive to a charge than a discount. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this charge will remind customers to rethink their use of single-use plastic-lined cups, as it has with plastic bags,\u201d said Simon Redfern, vice-president of communications at Starbucks Europe. \u201cWe\u2019ve offered a reusable cup discount for 20 years, with only 1.8% of customers currently taking up this offer, so we\u2019re really interested in working with Hubbub to see how this charge could help to change behaviour and help to reduce waste.\u201d The trial comes after financial incentives to encourage consumers to use reusable coffee cups have had disappointing results. In 1998 Starbucks was the first coffee chain in the UK to offer users of reusable cups a discount \u2013 10p \u2013 before upping it to 25p in 2008. In 2016 it doubled this to 50p, but take-up remained low and it is now back to 25p. Earlier this month Pret a Manger doubled its discount to 50p on all hot drinks bought by customers with reusable cups, and is planning to launch its own reusable cup later in the year. In 2017, Hubbub led the successful Square Mile challenge campaign that recycled 4m cups from the City of London in nine months. The Hubbub co-founder Gavin Ellis said: \u201cPrevious studies have shown that adding a charge on single-use cups is more effective than money off with a reusable cup. We\u2019re excited to be working on this initiative with Starbucks to find out if this is the case on the high street and to discover what else will encourage people to use reusable cups.\u201d The Q&amp;A about reusable cups was amended on 26 February 2018 to clarify that Greggs offers a 20p discount to customers presenting any such cup, not just its own-brand ones.",

But figures from the Bank of England suggest there remain about 200m tenners worth \u00a32bn still in circulation. Returns of old \u00a310 notes have been running at about \u00a385m a week, so it is likely that despite a last-minute rush, there will still be significantly more than \u00a31bn-worth of tenners that will cease to be legal tender from Thursday. The Bank says the withdrawal of the paper \u00a310 note featuring Charles Darwin is proceding very similarly to the old \u00a35 note. It said: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect all notes to be returned as some will have been destroyed, gone overseas or kept as memorabilia.\u201d When shops and stores stop taking the old notes, it does not mean that if someone unearths one after 1 March they are obsolete. Holders of the notes should still be able to exchange them at post offices or local banks, although they are not under a legal obligation to do so. Old notes can also be posted to the Bank of England or individuals can visit the bank in person at Threadneedle Street in the City of London, and it will exchange old notes for new ones. The Bank has an open-ended promise to exchange old notes at face value at any time. The new plastic \u00a310 note featuring Jane Austen came into circulation in mid-September, replacing the \u00a38bn-worth of notes that carry the image of Charles Darwin. The Bank of England said that if the remaining Darwin tenners still in circulation were laid end to end \u201cthat\u2019s enough notes to retrace almost half of Darwin\u2019s journey on HMS Beagle. Or, these would weigh the same as nearly 2,000 giant Gal\u00e1pagos tortoises that Darwin saw on his travels.\u201d In Scotland, it\u2019s not just the paper \u00a310 note that ceases to be legal tender on 1 March, but also the paper \u00a35 note. In England, the paper \u00a35 note stopped being accepted in shops in May last year. More people turn up at the Bank of England with old notes than might be expected. The Bank said that since the paper fiver was withdrawn in May, it has exchanged notes for 46,000 customers \u2013 of which 27,000 visited Threadneedle Street in person.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Political efforts to force the business secretary, Greg Clark , to intervene in the hostile takeover bid for industrial giant GKN have intensified with an accusation by Britain\u2019s largest trade union that bosses of bidder Melrose support a hard Brexit that will damage manufacturing jobs. Research by Unite shows Melrose\u2019s executive chair, Christopher Miller, and his wife, Monica, donated \u00a337,500 to Vote Leave in the runup to the EU referendum while the vice-chair, David Roper, donated \u00a320,000 \u2013 a pro-leave stance that the union says justifies blocking the\u00a37.4bn deal unveiled last month. Steve Turner, Unite\u2019s assistant general secretary, said GKN\u2019s employees were reliant on \u201ctariff-free, frictionless trade\u201d but the donations meant \u201cworkers will want to know whether Melrose\u2019s bosses support a hard Brexit which could damage GKN\u2019s business and destroy jobs\u201d. GKN employs 6,000 of its 58,000-strong workforce in the UK. Of these, 3,000 employees predominantly help manufacture Airbus wings in the Bristol area, while a further 1,800 supply the car industry from a plant in Redditch, south of Birmingham. Last week it emerged that Miller and Roper are also sizeable donors to the Conservative party, with the former (who donates under the name James Christopher) having given at least \u00a340,492 and the latter at least \u00a3131,375. But Melrose said the political donations were a matter for the two individuals, and that the company itself did not donate to any political party. A Labour and a Conservative MP are also coordinating a letter of protest to be signed by Commons colleagues whose constituencies contain GKN sites. Employees are also preparing to lobby parliament on Wednesday to demonstrate their opposition to the bid. Jack Dromey, the Labour MP for Birmingham Erdington, is coordinating the letter with Conservative Rachel Maclean, who represents Redditch. He said: \u201cGKN is a good company, a good employer. Melrose is an asset-stripper. For a company like GKN to fall prey to a company like Melrose would make a mockery of the idea of an industrial strategy in Britain.\u201d Melrose rejects the characterisation that it is an asset-stripper, describing its strategy as one where it acquires underperforming engineering companies and aims \u201cto double shareholders\u2019 investments over a three to five year time scale\u201d by restructuring them and selling them on. In an interview on Sunday, the chief executive of Melrose, Simon Peckham, said: \u201cWe are not asset-strippers, we are renovators and improvers. We don\u2019t load businesses with debt. We don\u2019t own businesses for ever, we do sell and give the money back to shareholders, then we do it again.\u201d The GKN row has rapidly become a test case for government\u2019s willingness to intervene as part of an emerging UK industrial strategy. Clark\u2019s business department is examining if it can call a public interest inquiry. But the only legal grounds for doing so are national interest, which applies to defence contractors, or financial stability, which is intended to apply to banks. Last week, Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, wrote to Clark expressing his concern over the deal because GKN supplies parts for the F-35 fighter jet, the A400M military transport aircraft, and the Ajax armoured vehicle that is used by the British Army. However, the bidder is understood to believe the legal grounds for Clark to become involved are thin. Melrose argues that GKN is not amongst the 100 largest suppliers of defence equipment for the MoD, and given that both are British companies, the question of national security should not arise. GKN releases full-year results on Tuesday, at a crucial point in the bid battle. Some believe this could be a point where Melrose sweetens its mostly paper bid to win a board recommendation, although with GKN share price of 426.5p roughly tracking the bid price of 419p it is not certain a high offer will be necessary. GKN has been fighting the takeover on financial value grounds while the political concerns swirl, although company sources have also accused Melrose of operating a short-term approach, acting as an industrial conglomerate that aims to sell assets around three years after acquiring them.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carillion\u2019s former finance director sold nearly \u00a3800,000 of shares after retiring last year shortly before the firm\u2019s collapse, according to evidence published by MPs. Richard Adam, who had managed Carillion\u2019s finances for a decade, offloaded \u00a3534,000 of shares on 1 March last year, three months after stepping down from the company, before selling a further \u00a3242,000 of stock handed to him in May as part of a bonus scheme. Soon after the second sale, auditor KPMG performed a review of the company\u2019s key contracts that eventually forced it to slash their value by \u00a3845m and issue a profit warning, beginning a rapid descent into liquidation that rendered shares in the firm worthless. Details of the share sales emerged days after evidence submitted in a parliamentary inquiry revealed that the chair of the Carillion\u2019s pension trustees believed Adam considered payments into its ailing pension scheme a \u201cwaste of money\u201d. Work and pensions committee chair, Frank Field, who is leading the inquiry along with the business committee chair, Rachel Reeves, said Adam\u2019s share sales were indicative of his view of the company\u2019s prospects. \u201cMr Adam presided over Carillion\u2019s finances for a decade,\u201d said Field. \u201cHe, more than anyone else, ought to know the merits of Carillion shares as a long-term investment in the light of his lengthy and lucrative tenure. His assessment? Dumping the last of his shares at the first possible moment because he is \u2013 with his own money at least \u2013 \u2018risk averse\u2019. What conclusions are we to draw from that?\u201d In a letter to MPs conducting the inquiry, Adam said: \u201cI sold the shares on these dates because they were the days that I was invited to do so by the company.\u201d The committee also published evidence from Adam\u2019s successor, Zafar Khan, who has claimed in evidence to MPs that he was sacked in September 2017 after he \u201cspooked\u201d the rest of the board with a presentation warning that the company\u2019s finances had worsened. In a letter to the inquiry, Khan said he could not understand the board\u2019s reaction as it \u201cshould have been apparent to the board by then that the company was struggling to improve both its net debt and profit positions\u201d. Field said: \u201cThe other directors appear keen to set up the hapless Zafar Khan as the fall guy for the collapse. It is not lost on us, however, that he inherited Carillion\u2019s mountain of debt. Khan told MPs that while the deterioration in key contracts had been an important element in Carillion\u2019s demise, the \u201cprincipal contributing factor\u201d was the level of debt that had built up before his brief tenure as finance director. He said that by the time he became a director on 1 January 2017, the board had \u201cover a number of years, allowed Carillon\u2019s debt to get, in my view, far too high, and had not addressed the reduction of debt as a priority\u201d. Carillion\u2019s average net debt on a monthly basis increased from \u00a341.8m in 2010 to \u00a3586.5m by 2016, Khan said. Khan and Adam were among former directors branded \u201cdelusional\u201d by MPs after they gave evidence about the circumstances leading up to Carillion\u2019s failure.",

His assessment? Dumping the last of his shares at the first possible moment because he is \u2013 with his own money at least \u2013 \u2018risk averse\u2019. What conclusions are we to draw from that?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d5e7f303-db04-4283-b095-c2f490e251f5\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Carillion relied on major contracts, some of which proved much less lucrative than it thought.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Earlier this year it slashed the value of them by \u00a3845m, of which \u00a3375m related to major public-private partnerships (PPPs) such as Royal Liverpool University hospital.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>As its contracts underperformed, its debts soared to \u00a3900m.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The company needed a \u00a3300m cash injection, but the banks that lent it money refused to put more in.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The government also refused to step in and bail the firm out.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>That left the company unable to continue trading and forced it to go into liquidation.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a letter to MPs conducting the inquiry, Adam said: \u201cI sold the shares on these dates because they were the days that I was invited to do so by the company.\u201d</p> \n<p>The committee also published evidence from Adam\u2019s successor, Zafar Khan, who has claimed in evidence to MPs that he was sacked in September 2017 after he \u201cspooked\u201d the rest of the board with a presentation warning that the company\u2019s finances had worsened.</p> \n<p>In a letter to the inquiry, Khan said he could not understand the board\u2019s reaction as it \u201cshould have been apparent to the board by then that the company was struggling to improve both its net debt and profit positions\u201d.</p> \n<p>Field said: \u201cThe other directors appear keen to set up the hapless Zafar Khan as the fall guy for the collapse. It is not lost on us, however, that he inherited Carillion\u2019s mountain of debt.</p> \n<p>Khan told MPs that while the deterioration in key contracts had been an important element in Carillion\u2019s demise, the \u201cprincipal contributing factor\u201d was the level of debt that had built up before his brief tenure as finance director.</p> \n<p>He said that by the time he became a director on 1 January 2017, the board had \u201cover a number of years, allowed Carillon\u2019s debt to get, in my view, far too high, and had not addressed the reduction of debt as a priority\u201d.</p> \n<p>Carillion\u2019s average net debt on a monthly basis increased from \u00a341.8m in 2010 to \u00a3586.5m by 2016, Khan said.</p> \n<p>Khan and Adam were among former directors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/carillion-director-mp-executives-collapse\">branded \u201cdelusional\u201d by MPs </a>after they gave evidence about the circumstances leading up to Carillion\u2019s failure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a73f85d-6e55-43ac-8fd1-627d04f34d7a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>How did the company get into trouble?</p>\n    <p>Companies like Carillion have to keep projects on budget and keep winning new contracts. When one of those fail, problems loom.</p>\n    <p>Carilllion shocked the market in July with a massive profit warning, writing down its value by \u00a3845m, all related to key contracts. Two more profit warnings followed and the company admitted it needed cash quickly not to breach bank loan terms</p>\n    <p>At the start of 2017 shares were changing hands at 240p. This weekend they were 14p.</p>\n    <p>With debts of \u00a3900m it has been trying to arrange a \u00a3300m cash injection. However, lenders will not provide the cash without government guarantees.</p>\n    <p>What happens to the pension scheme?&nbsp;<br></p>\n    <p>Carillion has a \u00a3580m pension scheme deficit. If it collapses the government-backed Pension Protection Fund would take over the scheme, although the liability would swell, to \u00a3800m. While the Fund provides a safety net for millions of workers, there are limits on what it can pay out.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Who runs Carillion?</p>\n    <p>Chief executive Richard Howson quit after the July profit warning, with the new boss yet to start. It has been run by engineering industry veteran Keith Cochrane and the group\u2019s chairman Philip Green, the former boss of United Utilities. Sally Morgan, who was director of government relations for Prime Minister Tony Blair, is also a director.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",
