      "bodyText": "The number of lawsuits accusing Starbucks of deceiving its customers by serving them too much ice has fallen by one. In June, a California man named Alexander Forouzesh filed a proposed class action suit alleging that customers ordering cold beverages from Starbucks received less liquid than advertised as ice could take up as much space as 10 fl oz. But ordering a cold drink means it will be served with ice, according to US district judge Percy Anderson. In his decision, Percy wrote: If children have figured out that including ice in a cold beverage decreases the amount of liquid they will receive, the Court has no difficulty concluding that a reasonable consumer would not be deceived into thinking that when they order an iced tea, that the drink they receive will include both ice and tea and that for a given size cup, some portion of the drink will be ice rather than whatever liquid beverage the consumer ordered. The judge also pointed out that since the cups used for cold drinks are clear, it is easy for customers to see how much ice they are getting. Since the lawsuit was first filed, Starbucks has insisted that ice is an \u201cessential component of any \u2018ice\u2019 beverage\u201d. The company also reiterated that any customer unhappy with their beverage could alert their barista and get a new one. Customers are also welcome to ask for light ice or extra ice when placing their order. A similar case against Starbucks is still making its way through the Illinois court system. Chicago resident Stacey Pincus filed a 29-page complaint claiming that Starbucks\u2019 cup sizes were deceiving customers since ice beverages contained less liquid than advertised. The complaint also noted that cold drinks tended to cost more than hot drinks and that the company was making more money off of customers buying iced drinks. \u201cI can promise you the ice issue is much ado about nothing,\u201d Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, told CNBC in June. However, a few weeks later, a San Francisco judge allowed another lawsuit against Starbucks to go forward. This time, the plaintiffs said that the coffee giant was deceiving customers by serving them too much foam in their lattes and thus providing them with 25% less liquid than advertised. \u201cBy underfilling its lattes, thereby shortchanging its customers, Starbucks has saved countless millions of dollars in the cost of goods sold and was unjustly enriched by taking payment for more product than it delivers,\u201d claimed the lawsuit. US district judge Thelton Henderson did not rule on the case\u2019s merits and allowed the lawsuit to go forward, noting: \u201cThis is not a case where the alleged deception is simply implausible as a matter of law. The court finds it probable that a significant portion of the latte-consuming public could believe that a \u2018Grande\u2019 contains 16 ounces of fluid.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Local authority pension funds are planning to back a shareholder resolution calling for an independent review of Sports Direct\u2019s treatment of employees. The retail group will hold its annual general meeting on 7 September in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where shareholders will vote on a trade union-backed plan to commission an investigation into working practices that will report back within six months. Last week, the company said it would publish an \u201cindependent report\u201d on working practices put together by its lawyers, RPC. It said the report would review and report on an internal investigation announced last December after the Guardian\u2019s revelations about treatment of staff at its Shirebrook warehouse. The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) said it was supporting the Unite resolution, briefing member funds that the company\u2019s review, led by Sports Direct\u2019s majority shareholder and founder Mike Ashley, was not independent. It added that RPC\u2019s report \u201cwould just rubber-stamp the company\u2019s version of affairs\u201d. \u201cLAPFF\u2019s hope is that an independent human capital strategy review will rectify any workplace practices deemed inappropriate and will help Sports Direct to move forward from the reputational and financial damage it has suffered,\u201d said LAPFF\u2019s chairman, councillor Kieran Quinn. \u201cLAPFF\u2019s view is that responsible business practices by companies lead to sustainable returns for investors over the long term. We are worried that this view is not shared by Sports Direct.\u201d The Trade Union Share Owners group, which represents \u00a31bn of pension funds and worked with Unite and Sports Direct shareholders including the Unison and TUC pension funds to put forward the resolution, said RPC \u201clacks relevant expertise in employment and industrial relations practice\u201d. Sports Direct\u2019s board has advised shareholders to vote against the resolution as it had already asked RPC to undertake a review. In its recommendation, it said: \u201cThe board therefore considers the action called for by this resolution to be an unnecessary distraction that would duplicate the important work that is already under way.\u201d Sports Direct has come under pressure to reform its working practices and corporate governance as its sales performance and share price have suffered following damning revelations about its treatment of store and warehouse workers. The calls for change got louder this week as it emerged that Sports Direct pays an obscure company owned by Ashley\u2019s brother to deliver online orders outside the UK. One of Sports Direct\u2019s top 10 shareholders said the arrangement with John Ashley did not look good, while Royal London Asset Management said it had lost confidence in the retailer\u2019s directors to protect the interests of investors other than its founder. Leading shareholders had already told the Guardian they were considering voting against board reappointments. A leading advisory group has recommended that Sports Direct shareholders should vote against the reelection of the company\u2019s chairman Keith Hellawell, and Mike Ashley. In a note to clients, Pensions and Investment Research Consultants (Pirc) said under Hellawell\u2019s leadership Sports Direct\u2019s board had \u201cconsistently failed to address the employment practices issues raised by some shareholders and trade unions that have also been criticised by a parliamentary select committee report\u201d. Sports Direct has commissioned an external evaluation of its board of directors, following criticism of the retailer\u2019s corporate governance. More than 28% of independent shareholders did not back Hellawell at last year\u2019s annual meeting, including the well-respected Standard Life. New rules mean he must now win their support, rather than relying on the vote of Ashley, the company\u2019s founder who owns a 55% stake.",

      "bodyText": "Britain appears to be bouncing back from the post-Brexit panic in better shape than expected, after a string of indicators showed growth across the manufacturing sector, the building industry and in consumer spending. A survey of manufacturers reported a rise in exports to their highest level in two years. Persimmon, Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilder, said customers were flocking back to view new build homes. And grocers enjoyed a 0.3% rise in sales in the 12 weeks to 14 August, the best performance since March. Nicholas Wrigley, Persimmon\u2019s chairman, said that while the result of the EU referendum had created increased uncertainty, the news was quickly digested by customers. \u201cCustomer interest since then has been robust with a strengthening of visitor numbers to our sites compared to the same period last year,\u201d he said. Economists have revised their pessimistic forecasts for the rest of the year and 2017 following a run of figures showing only a modest dip and steady rise in activity since the June 23 vote. Pro-Brexit campaigners have taken these figures as a sign that the warnings of an economic collapse after a no vote were alarmist and misleading. However, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at financial data provider IHS Markit, said the bounceback was mostly the result of a \u201chuge policy response\u201d from the Bank of England and the Treasury. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that everyone who was ringing the alarm bells over Brexit was scare mongering because really it was the warnings that triggered those strong policy actions,\u201d he said. Bank of England governor Mark Carney said in June policymakers would consider radical action to avert a recession and in August pushed through a cut in interest rates and a \u00a340bn boost to quantitative easing (QE). The chancellor, Philip Hammond, who rebuffed calls for an emergency budget, has also hinted strongly that the government\u2019s previous plans for budget cuts could be relaxed. Williamson said that without steep falls in the purchasing manager indices (PMIs) of activity in manufacturing, construction and services for July, collated by IHS Markit, it is possible the economy would have sleepwalked into a recession. \u201cIf the PMIs hadn\u2019t fallen off a cliff, the BoE wouldn\u2019t have cut interest rates and expanded QE,\u201d he added. The survey by the business lobby group the CBI of manufacturers found that the dive in sterling, prompted by the vote to leave the EU, gave a strong boost to exports of manufactured goods that offset uncertainty in the domestic market. Total order books were slightly weaker in the three months to August compared with the quarter to the end of July, down from a balance of -4 to -5, the report said. But the overall picture was of an industry with orders that remained \u201ccomfortably above the long-run average\u201d, according to the CBI, with output growth at a healthy pace. The main shadow on the horizon was a concern that rising import costs would squeeze profitability. The average prices that manufacturers expected to charge over the next three months rose to +8 in August from +5 in July, their highest since February 2015. Paul Hollingsworth, a UK economist at Capital Economics, said the relatively upbeat tone of August\u2019s survey gave another reason to be tentatively optimistic about the referendum\u2019s impact on business. \u201cThe latest survey is another reason to think that the economy should avoid a deep recession,\u201d he said. British supermarket sales were boosted in August by the belated arrival of warm summer weather and a gold tinged Olympics feelgood factor, giving the best performance since March, according to Kantar Worldpanel. The market analysis firm said sales of ice-cream and lollies jumped by nearly a quarter in the last month of that period, while chilled drinks rose by 10% as Brits sought to cool off. The performance marks a bounceback from supermarkets\u2019 worst performance in two years in July when cold, damp weather hit sales in the wake of the Brexit vote. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to outperform the rest of the market with sales up 10.4% and 12.2% respectively. All the big four major supermarkets saw sales fall back, with Asda the worst of the bunch as sales fell 5.5%. Tesco achieved its best performance in 18 months but sales still fell by 0.4% taking its market share to 28.1%. The building industry suffered a share price slump ahead of the Brexit vote and in the week following. But Persimmon said trading since 23 June had been strong and that after a short period of wariness, customer interest had increased from a year earlier. However, after Persimmon\u2019s upbeat first half results and outlook its shares closed up 4.2% and other house builders were also among the biggest FTSE 100 risers, with Barratt rising 4.9%, Taylor Wimpey 4% and Berkeley Group 3.9%. Along with other housebuilders, Persimmon\u2019s shares fell after the referendum result amid fears that falling consumer confidence and an economic slowdown would dent the housing market. Countrywide, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent, predicted this week that average prices would fall 1% next year before rising again.",

      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has settled a damaging dispute with two of its suppliers that hit car production at more than half of its German factories. After more than 20 hours of negotiations that lasted through the night, the German carmaker said on Tuesday that it had reached an agreement with CarTrim, which makes seats, and ES Automobilguss, which manufactures cast iron parts for gearboxes. The dispute affected almost 28,000 workers at six of VW\u2019s 10 factories in Germany. The Wolfsburg-based company halted production of the popular Golf and Passat cars at the start of the week, as well as assembly of engines, gearboxes and emissions systems. In a statement, VW said that the suppliers would start delivering parts again \u201cin the near future\u201d and that the affected factories would gradually resume production. Reeling from the emissions scandal, which has resulted in a sales slump and billions of euros of costs, VW had indicated that it would be pushing for price cuts from its suppliers. It has set aside \u20ac18bn to cover litigation and other costs of the scandal, after admitting last September that 11million diesel-powered cars around the world were fitted with software designed to cheat emissions tests. Last week VW asked a German court to take action against Prevent, the Bosnia-based parent group of CarTrim and ES Automobilguss, for refusing to follow an order to resume deliveries. The dispute centred on a cancelled contract. Prevent\u2019s German subsidiaries stopped delivering parts to VW when it refused to reimburse the supplier for changes made at its factories before the start of a new contract that was then cancelled. Olaf Lies, the economy minister of the state of Lower Saxony, where VW is based, and a member of the company\u2019s supervisory board, has said that the dispute had hit VW at the worst possible time. Whether VW\u2019s management should face questions for being overly reliant on a single supplier required clarification, he said. Germany\u2019s economy ministry had urged both sides to drop their dispute, expressing concern about the impact on jobs. The German Association of Supply Chain Management, Procurement and Logistics has warned of knock-on effects on 500 other companies that supply parts for the Golf. A VW spokeswoman said it was difficult to predict when production would be resumed and that decisions would be made on a site-by-site basis. At Emden, where the company makes the Passat, production was halted last Thursday when the carmaker ran out of seats. On Monday, production ceased at Wolfsburg, which normally makes 2,200 Golfs a day and employs 10,000 people; Zwickau, which produces Golfs and Passats; and Braunschweig, which makes chassis components and plastic parts. Kassel, which produces transmission and exhaust systems, was due to switch to short-time working on Thursday but is now ramping up production again. It was unclear whether Salzgitter, which is involved in engine production, would suspend production on Wednesday as planned. Analysts at investment bank UBS have estimated that a one-week production stoppage at Wolfsburg could cut VW\u2019s profits by \u20ac100m, while analysts at Commerzbank have put the damage at \u20ac70m a week.",

    "webTitle": "The time has come for a speaking clock with a northern accent", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The first reaction to the news that BT are looking for a replacement voice for the speaking clock was surprise that it still exists. In our time-obsessed world of mobiles and iPads, are there really people who need to call 123 to get the time? Well, yes, there are \u2013 12 million of them a year; down from 70 million a decade ago but still a sizeable chunk of the population. \u201cClocks on computers are not as accurate as people think,\u201d explains David Hay, head of BT heritage and archives. Which is where the speaking clock, accurate to five-thousandths of a second, comes in, with demand peaking on New Year\u2019s Eve and Remembrance Sunday, when exactitude is everything. There have been four voices in the speaking clock\u2019s 80-year history: Jane Cain (1936-63); Pat Simmons (1963-85); Brian Cobby (1985-2007); and, since 2007, Sara Mendes da Costa. The first three were Post Office or BT employees, chosen in an internal competition. Mendes da Costa was selected in a public competition, and the latter model will again be followed, with BT linking up with The One Show to find the next voice, which will be revealed in November. Cain and Simmons had wonderfully clipped, cut-glass accents. Hay says telephone operators in the 1930s and 40s were rigorously trained in enunciation; Cain and Simmons make the Queen sound common. Simmons\u2019s voice, which was used in the era when the telephone was becoming universal and when the number of calls to the speaking clock ran into hundreds of millions, is preserved on a separate service run by another company. Cobby\u2019s voice had more warmth \u2013 the characteristic BT now places first among the qualities it is looking for. He had been an actor before he joined BT, and Hay calls his voice \u201cmellifluous\u201d. The story goes that his voice was so reassuring that elderly ladies liked to ring the speaking clock last thing at night. Mendes da Costa has that warmth, too, as well as clarity and classlessness. So, what now? \u201cWe have no preconceived ideas,\u201d says Hay, who is on the panel that will select the winning voice. \u201cPersonally, I really liked the last two voices and will be looking for that kind of warmth.\u201d Surely it\u2019s time for a northern voice? \u201cIt could be northern, Scottish, Welsh, Irish \u2013 accent shouldn\u2019t be a bar,\u201d he says. But you wonder if the panel choosing the voice would make that leap.

      "body": "<p>The first reaction to the news that BT are looking for a&#xa0;replacement voice for the speaking clock was surprise that it still exists. In our time-obsessed world of mobiles and iPads, are there really people who need to call 123 to get the time? Well, yes, there are \u2013 12&#xa0;million of them a year; down from 70&#xa0;million a&#xa0;decade ago but still a sizeable chunk of the population. \u201cClocks on computers are not as accurate as people think,\u201d explains David Hay, head of BT heritage and archives. Which is where the speaking clock, accurate to five-thousandths of a second, comes in, with demand peaking on New Year\u2019s Eve and Remembrance Sunday, when exactitude is everything.</p> <p>There have been four voices in the speaking clock\u2019s 80-year history: Jane Cain (1936-63); Pat Simmons (1963-85); Brian Cobby (1985-2007); and, since 2007, Sara Mendes da Costa. The first three were Post Office or BT employees, chosen in an internal competition. Mendes da Costa was selected in a public competition, and the latter model will again be followed, with BT <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5HG6zJ9VBnB5VjS6SMDvxJF/the-one-show-speaking-clock-competition?preview=true\" title=\"\">linking up with The One Show</a> to find the next voice, which will be revealed in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ff380de34034a3ebceca06e3c6ce751915dab47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ff380de34034a3ebceca06e3c6ce751915dab47/0_0_1000_802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ethel Jane Cain, the voice of the speaking clock.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ethel Jane Cain, the voice of the speaking clock.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BT Heritage and Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cain and Simmons had wonderfully clipped, cut-glass accents. Hay says telephone operators in the 1930s and 40s were rigorously trained in enunciation; Cain and Simmons make the Queen sound common. Simmons\u2019s voice, which was used in the era when the telephone was becoming universal and when the number of calls to the speaking clock ran into hundreds of millions, is preserved on a&#xa0;separate service run by another company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/but-time-is-against-ou-at-the-third-stroke-the-speakingclcok-will-have-a-new-voice\">At the third stroke \u2013 the speaking clock will have a new voice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cobby\u2019s voice had more warmth \u2013 the characteristic BT now places first among the qualities it is looking for. He had been an actor before he joined BT, and Hay calls his voice \u201cmellifluous\u201d. The story goes that his voice was so reassuring that elderly ladies liked to ring the speaking clock last thing at night. Mendes da Costa has that warmth, too, as well as clarity and classlessness.</p> <p>So, what now? \u201cWe have no preconceived ideas,\u201d says Hay, who is on the panel that will select the winning voice. \u201cPersonally, I really liked the last two voices and will be looking for that kind of warmth.\u201d Surely it\u2019s time for a northern voice? \u201cIt could be northern, Scottish, Welsh, Irish \u2013 accent shouldn\u2019t be a bar,\u201d he says. But you wonder if the panel choosing the voice would make that leap. Hay says the BBC now permit \u2013 indeed positively encourage \u2013 regional accents, but that\u2019s as part of a mix of voices.

      "bodyText": "A recovery in the oil price following talk that Iran might back moves to support crude helped lift stock markets, although investors remained cautious ahead of the speech by US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Friday. In the UK housebuilding shares were boosted by a upbeat update from Persimmon, while mining companies were lifted by a positive report from analysts at Jefferies. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 39.97 points or 0.59% better at 6868.51 Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.94% to 10592.88 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.72% to 4421.45 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 2.5% to 16778.05 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 1.33% at 8580.9 In Greece, the Athens market edged up 0.33% to 567.90 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 37 points or 0.2%. Elsewhere Brent crude has climbed 1.34% to $49.82 a barrel, while the pound is up 0.4% against the dollar at $1.3190. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with oil, and in the run up to the producers\u2019 meeting next month there are likely to be a number of conflicting headlines. Following Reuters\u2019 report that Iran might back measures to support the price and that the country had confirmed it would attend the meeting, comes this: Here\u2019s more on the earlier US manufacturing PMI figures from Markit: Brent crude is now up around 1% at $49.70. Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: Oil markets were volatile on Tuesday amid speculation and rumours over an OPEC output freeze. Early on, oil extended its decline on Tuesday following a bearish note from Goldman Sachs but anonymous sources reportedly from inside OPEC suggesting Iran is sending \u201cpositive signals that it may support joint action\u201c triggered a an afternoon rebound. While few really expect any agreement from OPEC when Iran is still increasing production, the mere prospect of one is enough to keep short-sellers at bay. The biggest build in net speculative positions in five years on Friday was in large part triggered by massive short-covering, which could easily come back into the market, should no deal be reached. Of course, getting an agreement on measures to support the oil price will not be easy. Reuters again: \u201cThe difficult question for all will be defining the freeze - at what level of production. Agreeing a number may be a challenge - unless they all agree to allow some form of flexibility?\u201d the senior industry source said. An OPEC source from a main Middle East oil producer agreed. \u201cFreezing output now is difficult, everyone is raising production. And even if, and I am saying \u2018if\u2019 ... we agreed to a freeze, no one will commit to stick to it,\u201d the source said. Oil is recovering some ground after its recent weakness, following a Reuters report that Iran may back measures to help support the price at a producers meeting next month. Crude prices had slipped back in recent days following a period of strength, as hopes that a deal on output began to fade. But Reuters said: Iran is sending positive signals that it may support joint action to prop up the oil market, sources in OPEC and the oil industry said, potentially aiding efforts to revive a global deal on freezing production levels at talks next month. OPEC\u2019s third-largest producer has been boosting output after the lifting of Western sanctions in January. Tehran refused to join a previous attempt this year by OPEC plus non-members such as Russia to stabilise production, and talks collapsed in April. Though Iran has not yet decided whether to join a new effort, Tehran appears to be more willing to reach an understanding with other oil producers, the sources said... \u201cIran is reaching its pre-sanctions production level soon and after that it can cooperate with the others,\u201d said a source familiar with Iranian thinking after del Pino\u2019s visit to Tehran. \u201cIn general, Iran prefers more actions from the OPEC side rather than just freezing at the maximum production level of all members. If this freezing issue helps prices to improve, Iran by positive words of support, will help\u201d... Iran confirmed its participation in the OPEC meeting in Algeria, an OPEC source said on Tuesday. Brent is currently up 0.41% at $49.36 a barrel after earlier falling as low as $48.48. The Bank of England\u2019s weekly purchase of 15 year plus gilts could signal it will struggle to fulfil its QE target, said Mitul Patel, head of interest rates at Henderson Global Investors: Today marked the third attempt by the Bank of England to buy long dated bonds as part of its new Quantitative Easing programme. Unfortunately, it proved to be a reversion back to the signals shown at the first buyback. Whilst the Bank attracted sufficient offers, they had to pay over a 5bps premium compared to the prevailing market yield level for some bonds. Gilts have rallied sharply following the result, led by longer dated bonds and it again raises concerns over how easily they will be able to complete their asset purchases over the coming months. Even so the ECB is likely to introduce further stimulus measures, according to ING senior economist Bert Colijn: Consumers seem more concerned about the post-Brexit economy than businesses are as confidence declines for third month in a row. Consumer confidence decreased by -0.6 points to -8.5 in the Eurozone, indicating that Europeans have lost quite some confidence this summer. While businesses are not yet signalling a weaker economic environment, consumers are clearly less confident after the Brexit-vote. This is the third decline in a row of confidence and it marks uncertainty over the current geopolitical and economic climate, but also about the personal economic situation as July\u2019s decline in confidence indicated. With indications from this morning\u2019s PMI that hiring might be slowing, that concern could be valid. If this were to be the case, that would likely slow down domestic demand in the Eurozone, which has been driving the recovery over recent quarters. The picture remains that optimism post-Brexit is premature. Although the PMI reached a 7-month high this morning, consumer confidence declines indicate that uncertainty does linger and that growth is likely to be affected by Brexit uncertainty as the process of the British exit drags along. Because of that, we remain of the opinion that growth rates are likely to decline in the second half of the year and that the ECB will announce further stimulus to counter the weakening growth environment shortly. The mixed signals from the eurozone should not trouble the European Central Bank too much, according to Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com. He said: ECB president Mario Draghi won\u2019t be overly concerned about the poor consumer confidence results released today as the downbeat sentiment has been part and parcel of the economic picture for some time now. The ECB will have been pleased to see strong data this morning from the two big beasts of the eurozone \u2013 Germany and France \u2013 in addition to the positive signals from the EU\u2019s manufacturing and services industries. However, Draghi will know that his plate is still full with events in Italy likely to be his most pressing concern. Ensuring the Italian economy remains resilient in the face of global uncertainty will be central to his wider eurozone plans, especially as the British government has no immediate plans to begin exit proceedings. In the wake of the Brexit vote, eurozone consumer confidence continued to fall. The European Commission said confidence declined from -7.9 in July to -8.5 in August, compared to expectations of a rebound in morale. The figures for the European Union as a whole saw a less dramatic fall, down from a revived -7.7 in July to -7.8. Back with the US, and the Richmond Federal Reserve manufacturing data is also painting a downbeat picture. The Fed\u2019s composite manufacturing index came in at -11 compared to +10 in July. Meanwhile new home sales are higher than expected: The Bank of England has successfully bought \u00a31.17bn of long-dated UK government debt for the second week in a row. After the failure of the first of the three auctions so far, the Bank received offers worth \u00a31.799bn this time round, with investors willing to sell 1.54 times what the Bank wanted. However that was down on the 2.67 cover last week, leaving some analysts worried about slowing demand. As the Federal Reserve considers its options for interest rates, an initial estimate for US manufacturing for August has come in below expectations. The Markit manufacturing PMI was 52.1 compared to 52.9 in July and expectations of a figure of 52.7. The output index edged up from 53.8 to 53.9 while the employment index dropped from 53.3 to 50.6 in August. As expected Wall Street is on the front foot in early trading, although investors are still cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen appearing at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday. There are also some manufacturing and housing figures due shortly, which could give further clues to the Fed\u2019s thinking on rate rises. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 91 points or 0.49%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have both opened around 0.3% higher. Wall Street is expected to open higher for the first time in three days. The focus is shifting to the big event of the week - the annual meeting of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. It kicks off on Thursday, but all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen on Friday when she gives a speech. Investors will be looking for any clues on when the Fed might raise rates. Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citi Private Bank, told Reuters: There is strong evidence that investors are staying on the sidelines ahead of Yellen\u2019s speech. But, by no means will the Fed want to cut off the bait for the September or December meeting. The Guardian\u2019s Sean Farrell reports: Dominic Chappell has been disqualified from driving for six months after an unsuccessful attempt by the former owner of BHS to argue he needed the use of his car to help employees of the stricken retailer. Chappell was fined \u00a3665 and given six points on his licence for driving his green Range Rover at an average speed of almost 64mph in Andover, Hampshire, on 6 April. The speed limit on the road was 40mph. The former racing car driver pleaded guilty to the offence at Aldershot magistrates court. He had 10 points on his licence for speeding offences in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Chappell, 49, told the court it would be a stretch for him to employ a chauffeur or take taxis and that he was the subject of abuse and \u201cstrong language\u201d when he took the train. He said he spent four days a week attending meetings about the collapse of BHS, which went bust in April after little more than a year in Chappell\u2019s ownership. The court heard Chappell\u2019s manor house in the village of Winterborne Clenston in Dorset is two miles from a bus stop and about 20 miles from the nearest train station. Chappell\u2019s wife drives 100 miles a day taking his young son to a private boarding school, where his daughter is a weekly boarder, he said. Magistrate Jenny Gove said Chappell\u2019s speed was \u201creally very excessive\u201d and the withdrawal of his licence would not cause him exceptional hardship. She ordered him to pay \u00a3150 in costs. Full story: Back with Ireland and following its latest unemployment data, the country has announced its first year of net immigration since 2009. Net immigration to Ireland peaked at more than 100,000 at the height of its housing boom in 2008. But during the subsequent EU and IMF bailout, the country lost around 30,000 people a year. Now the figures from the Central Statistics Office show migration added 3,000 to the population in the year to this April, the first increase in seven years. The Brexit vote has boosted sales of Swiss watches in the UK, as tourists take advantage of the weaker pound to snap up luxury goods. Sales jumped 13% in July. It makes the UK the fastest growing major market for the sale of watches brands such as Omega, Breitling and Rolex, with Italy the only other major market to see growth year on year. Read the full story here: In the corporate world, Asda is selling its loss-making photo business to Photo-Me International for about \u00a35.4m in cash. The photo booth operator will buy 191 Asda in-store photo centres and 172 self-service kiosks and operate the supermarket\u2019s online photo-processing service. It is paying \u00a33.35m for the business and will also buy about \u00a32m of stock. The deal is part of the supermarket chains attempts to offload some services and focus on its main grocery business where sales have fallen. Ireland has revised up its July unemployment rate to 8.3% from an earlier estimate of 7.8%. Irish unemployment peaked at 15.1% in early 2012. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, says the better-than-expected CBI survey suggests the economy will grow in the third quarter. Overall, the August CBI industrial trends survey supports hopes that the economy can keep growing in the third quarter, despite the heightened uncertainty after the Brexit vote. Third quarter growth hopes have been lifted by robust retail sales in July and the CBI survey suggests that manufacturing output could hold up better than had been feared. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said it was \u201cso far so good\u201d for the UK manufacturing sector. The fundamentals are supportive (low and falling bond yields, weaker pound etc) - all we need to fear is fear itself. If sentiment for hiring and investment suffers, then there is a downside risk to growth. But a great case in point is that export orders [in the CBI survey] boomed - up to -6 from -22 and the highest for around 2 years. So far so good... The CBI\u2019s industrial trends survey suggests manufacturers are preparing to pass on some of the higher prices they are having to pay for raw materials since the pound weakened. Average prices are expected to increase over the next quarter, with 17% companies expecting to raise prices and 8% expecting to cut prices, giving a balance of +8% - the highest since February 2015. Export order books at UK manufacturing firms were the strongest in two years in August according to the CBI. The business lobby group suggested it was down to the weakness of the pound, which makes British-made goods cheaper abroad. Of the 505 firms surveyed for the CBI\u2019s industrial trends survey, 21% said export orders were above normal, and 27% said they were below. That gave a -6% balance, which was the highest since August 2014. The orders balance overall (combining exports and domestic orders) was -5%, just below July\u2019s -4%. Output growth slowed to a balance of +11% from +16% in July, but it was better than manufacturers had expected. Anna Leach, the CBI\u2019s head of economic analysis and surveys, said it was a positive picture but added the government would have to do more to support businesses in the pro-Brexit vote environment. It\u2019s good to see manufacturing output growth coming in stronger than expected, and some signs that the fall in sterling is helping to bolster export orders. But the pound\u2019s weakness is a double-edged sword, as it benefits exporters but also pushes up costs and prices. The most significant effects of the vote to leave the EU will flow over the medium to long-term. Therefore firms need to see ambitious decisions in the [chancellor\u2019s] Autumn Statement that will secure the UK\u2019s economic future as changes to trade, regulation and access to skills loom on the horizon. Capital Economics has produced a useful table listing the upcoming UK data and whether it will tell us anything about economic activity since the Brexit vote: Britain\u2019s gender pay gap is a \u201cnational embarrassment\u201d according to the Lib Dems. The party is responding to a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which shows that on average women in the UK still earn 18% less then men. Meral Hussein-Ece, the Lib Dems\u2019 equalities spokesperson, said: The continued existence of the gender pay gap is a national embarrassment. It is appalling that half the UK population are destined for lower pay simply for being female. As a society we must fight to ensure everyone is given an equal chance in life yet every day that the gender pay gap remains we are failing to give that opportunity to millions. Some legal reaction from Kate Hodgkiss, employment partner at DLA Piper: The IFS report confirms that progress towards closing the gender pay gap remains glacial and verifies that a fundamental change in the way in which we address inequality of pay in the workplace is needed. The government\u2019s own affirmation that the draft Gender Pay Gap Regulations will come into effect by April 2017 is therefore welcomed as a first step in this process. Whilst the Equal Pay Act continues to assist women to achieve parity of pay, the act has not been effective to reduce the pay differential during the same period of time, as the report demonstrates. Furthermore, the impact of taking time out of the workplace for family reasons continues to have a significant impact upon a woman\u2019s pay potential for the remainder of her working life. Britain\u2019s quoted housebuilders are the FTSE\u2019s biggest risers this morning. The sector has been boosted by Persimmon, which has seen a jump in the number of people reserving new homes over the two months. It appears those in the market to buy new homes have not been put off by Brexit uncertainty. In the run-up to the 23 June referendum it was thought housebuilders would be among the worst hit by Brexit uncertainty. Christine Lagarde, head of the International Monetary Fund, warned of a potential housing market crash in the event of a vote to leave the EU. The FTSE 100 is currently up 0.5% or 36 points at 6,865. And at the other end of the table: Oil prices are down again this morning. Brent crude is down 1.2% at $48.58 a barrel. The price is under pressure amid signs that supply is rising and as hopes fade that oil producing countries will agree steps to try and halt the price falls. In a note on Monday, Morgan Stanley said major decisions were unlikely to be reached at next month\u2019s OPEC meeting. It followed earlier optimism among traders that an agreement to support crude prices could emerge. The flash PMIs for the eurozone show a mixed picture for August. Manufacturing growth slipped slightly lower, while growth in the services sector picked up. Overall the composite PMI index combining both sectors pointed to a slight rise in activity in August, suggesting any uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote is having a limited impact so far. The headline composite index edged up to 53.3 in August from 53.2 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had pencilled in 53.1. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit said the August PMIs suggested the eurozone economy would grow by 0.3% in the third quarter. The August flash PMI indicates that the eurozone remains on a steady growth path in the third quarter, with no signs of the recovery being derailed by Brexit uncertainty. The survey data are consistent with the region\u2019s GDP growing at a quarterly rate of 0.3% in the third quarter, or 1.2% annualised, which is similar to that seen on average over the first half of the year. A solid 0.5% pace of expansion in Germany is being accompanied by a return to modest growth in France in the third quarter, while the rest of the region is also seeing growth pick up after slowing in the second quarter. The flash PMIs for Germany show that private sector output continued to grow in August, but at a slower rate than July. The composite index combining manufacturing and services slipped to 54.4 in August from 55.3 in July. Anything above 50 is growth territory. Economists were predicting 55. The biggest drag on growth was Germany\u2019s services sector, which dropped to 53.3 in August from 54.4 in July. The flash manufacturing PMI dipped slightly to 53.6 from 53.8 last month. Oliver Kolodseike, economist at IHS Markit said the surveys still pointed to solid - but slowing - growth in Europe\u2019s largest economy: Today\u2019s survey results highlight that the German economy is continuing its uninterrupted upward trend in August. However, output, new orders and employment all rose at slightly weaker rates during the month, thereby signalling that business conditions have become a bit more challenging since the prior month. Nonetheless, the long-standing theme of solid economic growth in Germany continued in August and based on the survey data available for the third quarter so far, we should expect further steady GDP growth. It is unlikely that the 0.7% pace from the beginning of the year will be repeated, however. The pound is rising against the dollar this morning and is currently up 0.4% at $1.3186. It hit a three-week high of $1.3195, apparently as speculators trim back their short positions. The pound has also hit an 11-day high against the euro, with one euro worth 85.915p. Europe\u2019s major markets are all up in early trading: FTSE 100: +0.5% at 6,859 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.6% at 10,557 France\u2019s CAC: +0.6% at 4,415 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.8% at 8,535 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.8% at 16,496 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.6% at 342 The French flash PMIs have come in slightly better-than-expected overall. The manufacturing sector shrank with the headline index coming in at 48.5 (where anything below 50 signals contraction). Economists polled by Reuters were predicting a slightly less weak 48.8. But the services sector was in much better shape than expected, rising to 52 in August from 50.5 in July. Taking the two Makit surveys together, that gave a composite headline index of 51.6 in August, better than July\u2019s 50.1 and an indication that growth in the French private sector picked up modestly. Jack Kennedy, senior economist at IHS Markit said the picture was still mixed in the eurozone\u2019s second largest economy. France\u2019s private sector economy gathered some momentum in August, raising hopes of a pick-up in GDP growth after the stagnation seen in the second quarter. A stronger contribution from the service sector bolstered overall output, while manufacturing held its ground to halt a recent slide. That said, the trend in incoming new business remains muted while firms indicated a return to job shedding in the latest month, suggesting that the recovery remains stuck in the slow lane. A survey published overnight by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that pay inequality is still a major issue in the UK. On average, women earn 18% less than men and it gets worse for women who have children. The pay gap widens consistently for 12 years after a first child is born, by which point women receive 33% less pay an hour than men, according to the research funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. As the Guardian\u2019s Katie Allen points out in the full story below, Theresa May faces a challenge to create \u201ca country that works for everyone.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Flash PMIs for Germany, France, and the eurozone as a whole will provide the latest clues on how the private sector is performing in those economies. The surveys for August, which cover the services and manufacturing sector, are expected to show diverging fortunes for Europe\u2019s two largest economies, with Germany outperforming a more sluggish France. They will provide some idea of how well the eurozone is faring in the face of continued Brexit uncertainty. Also today, the Bank of England will attempt to buy more government bonds as it expands its quantitative easing programme. The CBI will give a snapshot of how British industry has performed in August, and there will be the latest manufacturing PMI and new home sales data in the US. European markets are expected to open higher this morning after sliding on Monday:",

While businesses are not yet signalling a weaker economic environment, consumers are clearly less confident after the Brexit-vote. This is the third decline in a row of confidence and it marks uncertainty over the current geopolitical and economic climate, but also about the personal economic situation as July\u2019s decline in confidence indicated. With indications from this morning\u2019s PMI that hiring might be slowing, that concern could be valid. If this were to be the case, that would likely slow down domestic demand in the Eurozone, which has been driving the recovery over recent quarters.</p> <p>The picture remains that optimism post-Brexit is premature. Although the PMI reached a 7-month high this morning, consumer confidence declines indicate that uncertainty does linger and that growth is likely to be affected by Brexit uncertainty as the process of the British exit drags along. Because of that, we remain of the opinion that growth rates are likely to decline in the second half of the year and that the ECB will announce further stimulus to counter the weakening growth environment shortly.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-57bc5ce6e4b048662988f5fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-08-23T14:26:57.525Z\">3.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The mixed signals from the eurozone should not trouble the European Central Bank too much, according to Dennis de Jong, managing director of UFX.com.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Just two days after Frank Ocean\u2019s Blonde, one of the biggest releases of the year, was released on Apple\u2019s iTunes, Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group and widely regarded as the most powerful executive in the music industry, has reportedly ordered the company\u2019s labels to stop the practice of making \u201cexclusive\u201d distribution deals with streaming services. According to Bob Lefsetz, author of an influential music industry newsletter, Grainge sent out a company-wide email on Monday. UMG, which boasted seven of 2015\u2019s 10 best-selling albums and 38.5% of the year\u2019s recorded-music sales, will be the first major label to ban the practice, which many feel has begun to diminish rather than enhance the way music is distributed and consumed. The directive will affect dozens of bands under the UMG umbrella, including all five of this year\u2019s album of the year Grammy nominees: Kendrick Lamar, Taylor Swift, the Weeknd, Chris Stapleton and Alabama Shakes. The practice of artists offering exclusives to competing streaming and download services, including Apple and Tidal, has been gaining traction this year. Both Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna launched their recent albums through Tidal, the streaming service part-owned by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s husband, Jay Z. The ultra-hyped Frank Ocean release coming exclusively through Apple, coupled with a deal announced earlier this month between Apple and Cash Money Records, whose artists include Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Young Money and Birdman, appears to have been sufficient to provoke label executives to action. Lefsetz, like many others in the business, believes making exclusive distribution deals is anti-competitive and ultimately harms the consumer and the artist. He says the Cupertino hardware giant whose music arm, Apple Music, is steered by former Universal head Jimmy Iovine, should be investigated by the government over anti-trust concerns \u201cbecause there\u2019s a conspiracy between Apple Music and the industry to change the game, to get everybody to pay for a subscription by putting hit content behind a paywall\u201d. But, he continues, the truth is few care. \u201cMost people don\u2019t give a crap about the new Frank Ocean album. We\u2019ve got an industry that promotes marginal products that appeal to few and makes them unavailable to most people? That\u2019s hysterical!\u201d Unhappiness over Apple\u2019s exclusive control of the Frank Ocean release comes a year after Taylor Swift wrote an open letter to Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, finding it to be \u201cshocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company\u201d that the firm was refusing to pay artists streaming revenue during its free, three-month trial period. Apple ultimately backed down. Previously, Apple had been forced into an embarrassing apology after loading half a billion Apple iTunes users with the latest U2 album during an iPhone launch. The download, for which Apple paid the band a reputed $60m, proved to be a PR disaster for the company and the band. The company\u2019s dispute with Swift predates the current trend for \u201cexclusives\u201d among streaming services \u2013 often accused of paying pitiful rates to copyright holders \u2013 as part of an effort to drive up subscriptions. For some artists, the war for subscribers has proved highly profitable even if, as many argue, the services ultimately serve to restrict rather than enhance broader consumer appeal. Last year, Apple paid the Canadian rapper Drake a reported $19m for an exclusive deal \u2013 a figure Apple has since disputed \u2013 to steal him away from signing with Jay Z\u2019s Tidal. \u201cI think that\u2019s just his competitive nature, and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s looking at the bigger picture: that it\u2019s not about me and it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about the future of the music business,\u201d Jay Z later said of Iovine. But as the battle for artists, especially those from the hip-hop/R&amp;B world, heats up, can Grainge \u2013 recently named the music business\u2019s most powerful executive \u2013 or any other label rival hope to compete? \u201cUpfront money talks,\u201d points out one former record company head, cautioning that the deals work for the streaming services but not necessarily for artists and labels. But with industry leader Spotify competing against the deep-pocketed tech giants Apple, Google and Amazon, hungry for market share, the stage is set for a new showdown over control as streaming becomes the dominant means of distribution. To Lefsetz, exclusives represent a misreading of the market that will ultimately alienate consumers. \u201cApple Music is a me-too product that works badly that\u2019s locked behind a paywall and the music industry wants it to be the dominant platform so the fan is squeezed and indie acts are pushed down to the bottom where they belong.\u201d But as the music industry awaits confirmation that UMG is pulling out of streaming exclusives, Lefsetz is also taking artists who sign exclusive distribution deals to task. \u201cShame on you Frank, and shame on everybody else who takes money from Apple and screws fans. There\u2019s enough money in music without taking every last buck, and the joke is on you, for thinking so short term, you want your music available to everybody, because in these days of information overload we need nobody, everybody is superfluous, you don\u2019t want to enter the marketplace with one hand tied behind your back,\u201d he wrote.",

Both Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna launched their recent albums through Tidal, the streaming service part-owned by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s husband, Jay Z. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/19/frank-ocean-endless-review-brilliantly-confounding\">Frank Ocean: Endless first-listen review \u2013 brilliantly confounding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ultra-hyped Frank Ocean release coming exclusively through Apple, coupled with a <a href=\"http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/apple-music-signs-game-changing-label-deal-cash-money-records/\">deal announced earlier this month</a> between Apple and Cash Money Records, whose artists include Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj, Young Money and Birdman, appears to have been sufficient to provoke label executives to action. </p> <p>Lefsetz, like many others in the business, believes making exclusive distribution deals is anti-competitive and ultimately harms the consumer and the artist.</p> <p>He says the Cupertino hardware giant whose music arm, Apple Music, is steered by former Universal head Jimmy Iovine, should be investigated by the government over anti-trust concerns \u201cbecause there\u2019s a conspiracy between Apple Music and the industry to change the game, to get everybody to pay for a subscription by putting hit content behind a paywall\u201d.<br></p> <p>But, he continues, the truth is few care. \u201cMost people don\u2019t give a crap about the new Frank Ocean album.

That\u2019s hysterical!\u201d</p> <p>Unhappiness over Apple\u2019s exclusive control of the Frank Ocean release comes a year after Taylor Swift wrote an open letter to Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, finding it to be \u201cshocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company\u201d that the firm was refusing to pay artists streaming revenue during its free, three-month trial period. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/22/apple-royalties-u-turn-is-taylor-swift-the-most-powerful-woman-in-music\">Apple ultimately backed down</a>.</p> <p>Previously, Apple had been forced into an embarrassing apology after loading half a billion Apple iTunes users with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/09/u2-songs-of-innocence-itunes-customers-free-album\">latest U2 album</a> during an iPhone launch.

The standard narrative in the UK is that we don\u2019t build enough houses, and that the likes of Persimmon, Barratt Homes and Taylor Wimpey need to knock out hundreds of thousands more a year if we\u2019re ever going to cap runaway price inflation and house our growing population. But Britain\u2019s big housebuilders are far from failing. Persimmon (the biggest player in the market) has issued bumper figures, with completions up 6%, profits up 29% and sales barely affected, if at all, by Brexit. Its share price has recovered to within a whisker of its pre-referendum high. If Persimmon were American, it would be that vast country\u2019s fourth biggest home builder. Persimmon is just under half the size of the biggest in the US, DR Horton, but its completions this year put it above America\u2019s fourth biggest builder, NVR. The problem with housebuilding in the UK lies not in the majors but in the minors. In 1988, according to the Home Builders Federation, there were 12,000 small and medium-sized residential housebuilding firms in Britain, defined as completing one to 100 homes a year. The number today? Fewer than 2,500. America builds far more homes because it has thriving mid-size building firms that have all but disappeared in Britain. Britain\u2019s former Mittelstand of mid-size housing firms have been destroyed by two forces: finance and planning. Reforms to the planning process in the early 1990s made the task of obtaining building permission more risky, and more expensive. Builders have always griped about the bureaucracy around obtaining planning permission, but the reality is that an application can cost tens of thousands of pounds, be hugely time-consuming, and ultimately unsuccessful. It\u2019s a risk that few small enterprises can afford to take. The second issue is development finance. Loans to building firms dried up completely during the credit crunch. Even the majors survived only by painful cash-calls to shareholders. Barratt Homes went cap in hand to the market for \u00a3720m in 2009, shortly after Taylor Wimpey asked for \u00a3533m to repair its balance sheet. Smaller builders just went to the wall. Since then, money has dribbled back, but only slowly. It says something about how abysmal bank lending still is when Funding Circle, a peer-to-peer lender, has become one of the biggest providers of loans to small builders. Since Funding Circle launched property finance loans in 2014, its loans have helped small property developers to build approximately 2,200 homes across the country. Such loans are welcome, but we can\u2019t rely on peer-to-peer as the whole answer. There are mutterings about new government-backed development finance packages in the offing, but precious little evidence so far. Theresa May spoke of the need to get Britain building again just before entering No 10. Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith are engaged in a bidding war as to who can promise the most new homes. What none of them are saying in detail is which companies are going to build these new housing estates, how they are going to be financed, and how they are going to unlock the blockages in the planning system. Unfortunately there is an innate tendency to corporatism in planning, as city councils prefer dealing with the volume builders. When they have a site for 500 homes to be allocated, it will be one of the giants who picks up the deal. Some of the smaller builders compare the current situation to Tesco v the independent shops \u2013 and it\u2019s Tesco that is still winning. Yet those rows of terraces that define the Victorian and Edwardian expansion of Britain\u2019s cities were not built by Barratt or Persimmon. Usually they were built to a plan but then sub-contracted to large numbers of small and artisan builders. To get Britain building again, we need not just the help of the volume builders \u2013 but a new strategy to revive the all but forgotten small building firm as well. Short-term bargains The price tag on Zara\u2019s clothes is a useful barometer of the currency markets. Shoppers will be familiar with the store\u2019s practice of listing prices in both sterling and euros, and for those with a knowledge of current exchange rates, it\u2019s obvious the pricing has gone awry. If this writer were 30 years younger and could slip into a pair of skinny jeans, the Zara store in London would charge \u00a329.99, equal to \u20ac34.92. The same item in Zara Paris or Madrid is \u20ac39.95. In other word\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest clothes retailer is charging, in euro terms, around 15% more than it charges in sterling. These price differentials have not been lost on wealthier cross-border shoppers (aka Chinese tourists). The latest evidence comes from Swiss watch makers, who are enjoying a boom in popularity in the UK, with Britain suddenly regarded as the world\u2019s bargain basement for luxury goods. Enjoy it while it lasts. What were seeing is a giant clearance sale, and the bargains will largely disappear once we restock our shelves with new imports, and are invoiced, rather painfully, in euros or dollars.",

      "bodyText": "The arrival of warm weather and a gold-tinged Olympics feelgood factor has boosted British supermarket sales over the past three months. The grocers enjoyed a 0.3% rise in sales in the 12 weeks to 14 August, the best performance since March, according to Kantar Worldpanel. The market analysis firm said sales of ice-cream and lollies jumped by nearly a quarter in the last month of that period, while chilled drinks rose by 10% as Brits sought to cool off. Analysts at Nielsen said that sales rose at their fastest pace since November 2013 in the four weeks to 13 August, but only if periods boosted by Easter and Christmas were excluded. It said mineral water sales rose 18.5%, beef burgers were up 19% and beer, wine and spirits rose 3% as sparkling wine sales leapt nearly 14%. The performance marks a bounceback from supermarkets\u2019 worst performance in two years in July when cold, damp weather hit sales after the Brexit vote. \u201cThe stellar Team GB performances at the Olympics combined with the hot weather, particularly in mid-July, helped supermarkets to their own personal best for some time,\u201d said Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight. \u201cBrexit seems to have been replaced by an Olympic feelgood factor among shoppers and there were more visits to buy food and drink in the last four weeks than this time last year.\u201d Sales were not boosted by any sign of inflation despite fears that the fall in the pound against the euro would make importing food more expensive. Grocery prices fell by 1.3% in the three months to 14 August, the 25th consecutive period of deflation, according to Kantar. However, analysts have previously said they do not expect food price inflation to feed through until the autumn when crops grown in the UK start to make up a smaller share of those bought in the supermarket. Discounters Aldi and Lidl continued to out perform the rest of the market with sales up 10.4% and 12.2% respectively. The big four supermarkets all saw sales fall back, and with Asda the worst of the bunch as sales fell 5.5%. Tesco achieved its best performance in 18 months but sales still fell by 0.4%, taking its market share to 28.1%.",

      "bodyText": "A return to growth in France and a solid pace of expansion in Germany have helped the eurozone shrug off the UK\u2019s vote to quit the EU. Economists feared the eurozone would suffer a damaging blow from the Brexit vote as exports to the UK became more expensive and business confidence waned. But those concerns appeared unfounded after the August composite IHS Markit survey \u2013 which brings together manufacturing, services and construction \u2013 indicated GDP growth across the 19-member currency zone will continue at 0.3% a quarter and 1.2% for the year. France posted a rise in output driven by the private sector, which increased output at the sharpest rate in 10 months during August. The IHS Markit purchasing managers\u2019 index jumped to 51.6, up from 50.1 in July, where a figure above 50 indicates an expansion in activity. The better-than-expected news for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, follows a report showing that France\u2019s unemployment rate fell below 10% in the second quarter, the lowest level since the French president took office in 2012. In Germany, a slowdown in the services sector was offset by strong export growth reported by manufacturers. The balance left the economy with slightly lower growth, but employers still faced large backlogs of work and increased employment to match the buoyant outlook. Political instability continues to threaten the recovery in the eurozone as countries as diverse as Italy, Finland and Greece struggle to recover from the 2008 financial crash. The refugee crisis and the longer-term threat of the UK leaving the EU are also high on European leaders\u2019 agenda at a meeting in Naples this week, which seeks to breathe new life into the European project. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at the data provider, said that in the short term there were \u201cno signs of the recovery being derailed by Brexit uncertainty\u201d. He said: \u201cThe survey data are consistent with the region\u2019s GDP growing at a quarterly rate of 0.3% in the third quarter, or 1.2% annualised, which is similar to that seen on average over the first half of the year.\u201d A sign that consumers are beginning to worry could be found in the European commission\u2019s consumer confidence indicator, which dipped 0.6 percentage points to -8.5 in the August flash release. But Bill Adams, senior international economist at PNC Financial Services, said this was only slightly weaker than its -8.2 average in 2016 before the referendum and hit confidence less than the Brussels terrorist attack in March or early 2016 financial volatility. The composite PMI found that German firms suffered a rise in input costs for the fourth consecutive month. However, inflationary pressures remained muted across the eurozone and growth, while steady, is likely to disappoint officials at the European Central Bank, who have pumped billions of euros into the financial system in a bid to increase growth and boost prices. Williamson said: \u201cWhile the resilience of the PMI in August will add to the belief that the ECB will see no need for any immediate further stimulus, the weakness of the overall pace of expansion and disappointing trends in hiring, order books, business optimism and prices all suggest that policymakers will keep the door open for more stimulus later in the year.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Swiss watch exports to UK rise as tourists make most of fall in sterling", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Swiss watch exports to the UK rose by 13.4% in July as tourists exploited the drop in the value of the pound to snap up luxury goods. The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry said watches worth 110.2m Swiss francs (\u00a387m) were exported to the UK last month, the best figures since November 2015. The figures are the latest sign of a boost for luxury retailers following the EU referendum result, which has pushed down sterling and made British shops more attractive to foreign visitors, with sales of jewellery and watches across the UK growing by more than 16% last month. The UK is now the cheapest luxury goods market in the world, according to analysts at stockbroker Exane BNP Paribas, which has predicted an uplift for British brands such as Burberry, Mulberry and Stella McCartney, as the stronger euro and dollar against the pound fuel tourist visits. \u201cTourist inflows and spend are highly correlated to exchange rates. Continental markets such as France have suffered from relatively higher prices and terror attacks. \u201cThe likely consequence is a tourist spend boom in the UK,\u201d said Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. The increase in Swiss watch exports to the UK compared with July 2015 makes Britain the fastest-growing major market for the sale of brands such as Omega, Breitling and Rolex. Brian Duffy, the chief executive of Aurum, which owns the Goldsmiths, Mappin &amp; Webb and Watches of Switzerland chains, said his outlets had seen an immediate pickup in sales of luxury watches (above \u00a35,000) on the day after the Brexit vote. This was most evident in London and at the group\u2019s airport stores, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear there\u2019s a boom going on. We are selling a lot of very high-end pieces where the absolute amount of savings can justify the cost of foreign travel. The savings on a \u00a330,000 watch can pay for a flight,\u201d he said. Michael Wainwright, the managing director of Boodles, which sells Patek Philippe watches, said the British luxury jeweller had seen good business from Asian and Middle Eastern clients, who usually visit the UK at this time of the year, because the exchange rate had made desired items about 18% cheaper than anywhere else in the eurozone. The pound has fallen by 11% against the euro and dollar since the vote to leave the EU. Wainwright said the chain had also recorded a rise in American buyers last month, when Swiss watches were as much as 30% cheaper in the UK than in the US. \u201cTo some extent, it is commodity dealing. Collectors will gravitate to the country offering the lowest price and at the moment that is the UK,\u201d he said. Jewellery sales were also benefiting from the pound\u2019s decline, although the market was less commoditised, and so differences in design, service and other factors had a bigger role to play than the watch market, where collectors know exactly what they want. \u201cThe weaker pound doesn\u2019t have such an enormous benefit as it does on watches, but it will help London, retail and luxury goods,\u201d he said. Mario Ortelli, a luxury goods analyst at Bernstein, agreed that the UK luxury market was likely to benefit as a whole from the lower value of the pound. \u201cMany tourists will decide to come to the UK, not because they like the weather, but because they think the exchange rate is improving prices,\u201d he said. But the global market for luxury goods was not likely to benefit overall from strong sales in the UK, he said, as shoppers were merely shifting from one country to another. However, Ortelli said luxury brands were likely to put up prices to ensure that they protected sales and profits, meaning the boost to the UK may not last. \u201cThe benefit will be short term,\u201d he said. Jewellers said brands including Patek Philippe and Cartier had already put up prices by between 8% and 10%, although Rolex, Omega and Breitling had yet to change. Meanwhile, Ryanair said it was carrying 20% more Americans and 10% more Chinese from Europe on shopping trips to the UK this summer, which it attributed to the fall in sterling. The rise in luxury spending in the UK might help brands with British heritage such as Burberry, which have suffered from falling numbers of Chinese visitors to Europe due to terror fears, and to Hong Kong because of visa changes.",

    "webTitle": "Former BHS owner Dominic Chappell gets driving ban", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell has been disqualified from driving for six months after an unsuccessful attempt by the former owner of BHS to argue he needed the use of his car to help sort out the affairs of the stricken retailer. Chappell was fined \u00a3665 and given six points on his licence for driving his green Range Rover at an average speed of almost 64mph in Andover, Hampshire, on 6 April. The speed limit on the road was 40mph. The former racing car driver pleaded guilty to the offence at Aldershot magistrates court. He had 10 points on his licence for speeding offences in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Chappell, 49, told the court it would be a stretch for him to employ a chauffeur or take taxis and that he was the subject of abuse and \u201cstrong language\u201d from other passengers when he took the train. He said he spent four days a week attending meetings about the collapse of BHS, which went bust in April after little more than a year in Chappell\u2019s ownership. He leaves home at 5.30am and returns at 9.30pm, he said. The court heard Chappell\u2019s manor house in the village of Winterborne Clenston in Dorset is two miles from a bus stop and about 20 miles from the nearest train station. Chappell\u2019s wife drives 100 miles a day taking his young son to a private school, where his daughter is a weekly boarder, he said. Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions bought BHS from Sir Philip Green in March 2015. The company entered administration 13 months later, but Retail Acquisitions banked at least \u00a317m. Chappell, a former bankrupt, had no retail experience when he bought the ailing chain from Green for \u00a31. The last of BHS\u2019s 164 stores are scheduled to close before the end of month. The department store chain\u2019s failure caused the loss of 11,000 jobs and left a \u00a3571m pension deficit that Green has promised to resolve. Chappell\u2019s barrister Michael Levy asked the court for \u201cone last chance\u201d for his client and for the magistrate to take into account Chappell\u2019s isolation and the commitments in meeting the Pension Regulator and dealing with parliamentary inquiries. He argued Chappell would suffer exceptional hardship if he lost his licence. \u201cIt may be there is a genuine public interest in this defendant helping these people as much as he possibly can, to the full and maximum. Clearly if he is not able to do that the whole process is going to be more difficult and drawn out and take longer.\u201d Magistrate Jenny Gove said Chappell\u2019s speed was \u201creally very excessive\u201d and the withdrawal of his licence would not cause him exceptional hardship. She ordered him to pay \u00a3150 in costs. Gove said: \u201cWe don\u2019t find exceptional hardship - it has to relate to other people who are innocent. You are the one who has to be punished.\u201d When police pulled Chappell over, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been driving since I was 18 and have never had an accident. I drive an average of 35,000 miles a year and I used to be a race car driver.\u201d Speaking after the hearing, Chappell said: \u201cI was speeding and shouldn\u2019t have been, and that\u2019s what happened. I am sorry for that.\u201d He said he would \u201cpossibly\u201d use public transport to take 20,000 documents in three boxes to meetings about BHS. Asked about BHS workers, he replied: \u201cI feel very sorry for them. British Home Stores has been a very difficult turnaround for us and I do regret that situation.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on 23 August 2016 to make clear that Dominic Chappell claimed he needed his driving licence to help in his continued dealings with the Pension Regulator and MPs.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in housebuilders have risen after Persimmon, the biggest company in the sector, said the UK vote to leave the EU has not put off potential homebuyers. Announcing first-half results, Persimmon said trading since the 23 June referendum had been strong and that after a short period of wariness customer interest had increased from a year earlier. Along with other housebuilders, Persimmon\u2019s shares fell after the referendum result amid fears that falling consumer confidence and an economic slowdown would dent the housing market. Countrywide, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent, predicted this week that average prices would fall 1% next year before rising again. Nicholas Wrigley, Persimmon\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cWhile the result of the EU referendum has created increased uncertainty, the news was quickly digested by our customers. Customer interest since then has been robust with a strengthening of visitor numbers to our sites compared to the same period last year.\u201d Customer cancellations for viewings rose slightly in the week following the referendum but they are now running slightly lower than a year ago, Wrigley added. After dropping 37% on 24 June to \u00a313.10, Persimmon shares have regained most of the loss and were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100 following its upbeat statement, rising almost 5% to \u00a318.77 in early trading. Rival housebuilders Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Berkeley were also among the index\u2019s top 10 gainers. Persimmon\u2019s pre-tax profit rose 29% to \u00a3352m in the six months to the end of June as revenue rose 12% to 1.3bn. Housebuilders have boomed over the past few years supported by rising prices, economic growth and the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme. Finance director Mike Killoran said that after the traditionally quiet summer months Persimmon expected business to pick up in the autumn and that potential customers had their finances in place to buy. Killoran added: \u201cGiven the interest we are seeing on the sites from visitor traffic and people genuinely wanting to buy we can see no reason why we wouldn\u2019t see that [autumn] seasonality continue. All the feedback we are getting from sites is that given the market we are in and the product we are offering \u2026 there is a great desire to buy.\u201d",

Countrywide, Britain\u2019s biggest estate agent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/22/house-prices-to-fall-1-in-2017-predicts-countrywide\">predicted this week that average prices would fall 1% next year before rising again</a>.</p> <p>Nicholas Wrigley, Persimmon\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cWhile the result of the EU referendum has created increased uncertainty, the news was quickly digested by our customers. Customer interest since then has been robust with a strengthening of visitor numbers to our sites compared to the same period last year.\u201d<br></p> <p>Customer cancellations for viewings rose slightly in the week following the referendum but they are now running slightly lower than a year ago, Wrigley added. </p> <p>After dropping 37% on 24 June to \u00a313.10, Persimmon shares have regained most of the loss and were the biggest risers in the FTSE 100 following its upbeat statement, rising almost 5% to \u00a318.77 in early trading. Rival housebuilders Taylor Wimpey, Barratt and Berkeley were also among the index\u2019s top 10 gainers.</p> <p>Persimmon\u2019s pre-tax profit rose 29% to \u00a3352m in the six months to the end of June as revenue rose 12% to 1.3bn. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/06/nice-pile-executives-cashing-britains-housebuilding-berkeley-persimmon-barratt\">Housebuilders have boomed</a> over the past few years supported by rising prices, economic growth and the government\u2019s help-to-buy scheme.</p> <p>Finance director Mike Killoran said that after the traditionally quiet summer months Persimmon expected business to pick up in the autumn and that potential customers had their finances in place to buy.</p> <p>Killoran added: \u201cGiven the interest we are seeing on the sites from visitor traffic and people genuinely wanting to buy we can see no reason why we wouldn\u2019t see that [autumn] seasonality continue. All the feedback we are getting from sites is that given the market we are in and the product we are offering \u2026 there is a great desire to buy.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Leading shares are heading higher after two days of decline, with housing companies building up some good rises following a positive update from Persimmon. Persimmon said its reservation rate had risen by 17% since the start of July, as it shrugged off fears of a negative Brexit impact on the market. Its shares have added 74p to \u00a318.68 while rival Barratt Developments is up 20.7p at 484.2p, Taylor Wimpey has risen 6.5p to 165.2p and Berkeley Group is 99p better at \u00a326.49. Tesco has climbed 5.1p to 164.6p after Kantar Worldpanel said grocery sales received a warm weather boost in August, with Tesco\u2019s sales down 0.4% in the most recent 12 weeks, better than its major rivals but still well below the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Jefferies analysts said: Kantar UK food share update to 14 August confirms a healthier reading, supported by more favourable weather. Total market grew by +0.8% with continued healthy growth at the discounters (+11%) and resilience at the premium end (Marks +6.1%, Waitrose +1.8%). The Big 4 also saw an improvement (-1.1%) with pick up at Tesco (+0.9%) and Sainsbury (+0.2%). Morrison (-3%) continues to be impacted by the non-repeat of summer vouchering while share loss at Asda (-4.6%) persisted. Bruno Monteyne at Bernstein said: Tesco saw the best performance of the big-4 with a 0.4% sales decline (70 basis points below the market) and 20 basis points of market share losses, its best performance since March 2015 and a substantial improvement from the 1% market share Tesco was losing as recently as November. On a 4 week basis, Tesco\u2019s sales were up 0.9%, just 20 basis points below the market. National Grid has put on 1.5p to 1082.5p as regulator Ofgem said it could recoup \u00a395m of the \u00a3113m it had awarded to SSE and Drax to provide emergency back-up power for the coming winter. But the company said it was disappointed it would have to bear \u00a318m of the costs - which relate to the Drax contract - itself. But Royal Dutch Shell A shares are down 10p at \u00a318.91 amid the weakening oil price, while pharmaceutical shares were also unwanted. Hikma is down 8p at \u00a323.04 and AstraZeneca has dipped 7p to \u00a350.84. Overall the FTSE 100 has added 31.02 points to 6859.56, helped by reasonable eurozone manufacturing and service sector data for August, showing little impact from the Brexit vote. But investors are still cautious ahead of a speech from US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, said: Steady gains for markets are the order of the day, although cautious heads are pointing towards weakness in oil, further troubles for the dollar-yen rate and low volumes as reasons why the bounce may not last. Among the mid-caps annuity provider JRP - the merged Just Retirement and Partnership groups - jumped 14% to 100.8p after a positive update and a better than expected solvency ratio of 130%. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital issued a buy note and said: The news vacuum surrounding JRP since its first quarter 2016 interim management statement in mid-May has allowed the \u2018bears\u2019 to have a real pop at the company, especially throughout the Brexit-induced volatility in financial markets. In this context, we view today\u2019s trading statement as positive in respect of new business and the group\u2019s financial strength. Meanwhile Rank - which recently abandoned its joint bid with 888 for William Hill - has risen 4.2p to 225.7p as it reported a 2% dip in full year operating profit to \u00a382.4m but said recent trading had been positive and it had seen little or no direct effect from the Brexit vote. Analyst Ivor Jones at Peel Hunt said: The UK gambling industry is consolidating and getting more competitive. As the big get bigger we believe that life is going to get tougher for the squeezed middle. It was sound strategy to propose taking on debt and execution risk to create scale. With ambitious management, a soon-to-be debt free balance sheet and strong cash flow, we believe Rank is undervalued. There is still plenty of self-help to be getting on with to help keep the bottom line ticking over but we expect Rank to participate in consolidation in the medium-term.",
