      "bodyText": "OK, that\u2019s all for tonight. A very quick recap of this afternoon\u2019s developments. The US government has increased the pressure on Athens tonight, by warning finance minister Yanis Varoufakis that he needs to reach a \u2018constructive deal\u2019 soon. The ECB has thrown Greek banks a lifeline, by increasing the amount of emergency liquidity available to them by around \u20ac3.3bn Athens is expected to submit his proposal for a loan extension tomorrow. Varoufakis remains confidence; predicting that an agreement could be reached on Friday, on a teleconference with other finance ministers. But Germany\u2019s Wolfgang Schauble has warned there is little \u201cwriggle room\u201d, and there\u2019 not been many supportive noises from other eurozone members today. And the Open Europe thinktank has warned there are big divisions between the two sides, on crucial issues such as economic reform and the sale of state assets. Rating agency Fitch also weighed in, warning that the risks of the talks completely collapsing has risen. The Greece government has one success, though; MPs have elected a new president. Not that Prokopis Pavlopoulos lacks baggage..... And the European financial markets remained calm; most rose today, on hopes of a deal. If you missed this morning\u2019s action, check out the lunchtime summary. Otherwise, cheers, and goodnight all. GW Reuters\u2019 Athens bureau is now reporting that the ECB\u2019s liquidity increase might give Greek banks a week\u2019s grace, assuming savers don\u2019t withdraw funds at a faster rate: GREECE HAD ASKED THE ECB TO RAISE THE ELA CAP BY \u20ac5BN - SOURCES THE ACTUAL \u20ac3.3BN EUR INCREASE IN THE ELA CAP IS ENOUGH TO MEET GREEK BANKS\u2019 LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR ANOTHER WEEK IF CURRENT DEPOSIT OUTFLOW TRENDS PERSIST -SENIOR BANKER THE INCREASE IN ELA IS TO COVER GREEK BANKS\u2019 NEEDS, NOT THE GREEK STATE\u2019S SHORT-TERM BORROWING NEEDS -BANKING SOURCE Our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, points out that Prokopis Pavlopoulos is a controversial choice as Greece\u2019s new president. He was interior minister when riots erupted in Athens for days running, in an orgy of violence after the police shot dead a teenaged boy, Alexandros Grigoropoulos, in December 2008, Helena reminds us. As we wrote then: How police shooting of a teenage boy rallied the \u2018\u20ac700 generation\u2019 Helena adds: Pavlopoulos was also in government during the record growth of Greece\u2019s public finances with profligate practices that included rampant public sector hiring. The white-haired Pavlopoulos was among the worst offenders hiring almost everyone there was to hire in his local constituency in central Greece. Kostas Karkagiannis of the Kathimerini newspaper makes the same point: More reaction..... Back to the ECB\u2019s decision to give more emergency liquidity to Greece\u2019s banks tonight. Reuters\u2019 Frankfurt bureau is reporting that the Greek central bank actually asked for the cap to be raised by \u20ac10bn, but only got \u20ac3.3bn. That does suggest it wanted significant protection against deposit outflows. RTE\u2019s Tony Connelly reckons there wasn\u2019t a formal vote: There\u2019s not much \u201cwiggle room\u201d for a deal with Greece, according to Germany\u2019s finance minister: GERMANY\u2019S SCHAEUBLE SAYS EVERYONE NEEDS TO KEEP IN MIND IN TALKS WITH GREECE OVER THE COMING DAYS THAT WE HAVE A COMMON RESPONSIBLITY TO STABILISE EUROPE SCHAEUBLE SAYS THERE IS LIMITED WIGGLE ROOM IN THE LOOMING NEGOTIATIONS WITH GREECE Wiggle room is such a great term, although not very encouraging. Wonder if Sch\u00e4uble actually used a German term -- Spielraum perhaps? Hang on....make that a reported \u20ac3.3bn increase in Greek bank liquidity -- today\u2019s rise to \u20ac68.3bn would be on top of the surprise \u20ac5bn rise last week (from \u20ac60bn to \u20ac65bn). So, not as big a move as thought, but better than a poke in the eye with a draft eurogroup statement. Greece\u2019s finance minister has declared that he\u2019s confident that eurozone finance ministers will approve his request for a loan extension on Friday, via a teleconference. Reuters has the details: GREEK FINMIN VAROUFAKIS SAYS I BELIEVE ON FRIDAY VIA A EUROGROUP TELECONFERENCE THE GREEK PROPOSAL WILL BE APPROVED GREEK FINMIN VAROUFAKIS SAYS I BELIEVE THE PROPOSAL WILL SATISFY THE GREEK SIDE AND THE EUROGROUP PRESIDENT Correction.... just seeing reports that the ECB has also voted to give Greek banks more emergency liquidity. A helpful move under the circumstances, which might calm fears over the health of the Greek banking sector in the coming days. Brace yourselves for a flurry of news flashes. First up: Dow Jones are reporting that the ECB has agreed to extend liquidity to the Greek banking sector for another two weeks. No word on whether they\u2019ve raised the limit -- as we mentioned earlier, the ECB was apparently split on this issue, with Germany\u2019s Jens Weidmann taking a hard line. It\u2019s official. Alexis Tsipras has succeeded where his predecessor Antonis Samaras failed, and persuaded MPs in the Greek parliament to elect a new president. There are two candidates in tonight\u2019s presidential vote. Greece\u2019s To Potami party weren\u2019t happy with the government\u2019s candidate, so proposed Nicos Alivizatos, a Professor of Constitutional Law, instead. He\u2019s not got a chance, though -- Prokopis Pavlopoulos can rely on the votes of the opposition New Democracy party (in which he served as a minister), as well as the Syriza-led government Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and finance minister Yanis Varoufakis spoke during the first round of the presidential vote.... Giovanna Pancheri, Europe correspondent at Sky Tg24, has heard the ECB probably won\u2019t released a statement tonight (which fits with what Bruno was told earlier) Nearly time for that vote in Athens.... (that\u2019s energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis) This is a little worrying.... Reuters is reporting that the European Central Bank is split tonight on whether to give Greek banks access to additional liquidity. Germany is not keen to offer extra help to the banks, who have suffered from deposit outflows since the crisis escalated, it says: Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, who has warned against the misuse of the emergency funding to indirectly finance the Greek state, opposed any increase in the cap, the sources said. But while some governors share his reservations, others want more leniency. One eurozone central bank official forecast a \u201cslight increase\u201d in ELA for Greece, stressing that the ECB \u201chas to try to preserve financial stability\u201d and \u201cits role is not to teach Greece some kind of lesson\u201d... More here: ECB divided over extra emergency funds for Greek banks So it might all come down to a vote. To turn off the ELA altogether would take a two-third majority.... Greece\u2019s finance minister has just confirmed that Jack Lew did indeed warn him that Greece will suffer without a deal (and also confirmed that he \u2018gets\u2019 Twitter like few other politicians): Heads up: the Greek parliament is convening to vote on whether to appoint Prokopis Pavlopoulos, a former interior minister, as President. Sounds like the eurogroup of finance ministers could be meeting again on Friday (assuming Greece submits its proposal in time) Europe\u2019s stock markets closed higher tonight, apart from the FTSE 100 which finished flat. CMC analyst Jasper Lawler says City traders are still hoping for an agreement whenGreece returns to the negotiating table: There is optimism that permission will be granted by Greece\u2019s EU creditors to extend its loan program beyond February and keep the country from defaulting and falling out of the Eurozone. The EU appears generally agreeable to a six-month extension of Greece\u2019s loan agreement. The major sticking point is whether over that 6 months Greece will be beholden to the same bailout terms as the current agreement. The new government in Athens has been given the mandate by Greek voters to undo austerity measures imposed in the existing program. To extend the bailout program after just a few weeks in power would be politically untenable for the Greeks. Documents from Monday\u2019s meeting indicate Greece\u2019s FinMin Varoufakis has proposed that the Greek government be allowed to run a budget surplus of just 1.5% instead of the current 3% and that the privatisations of public assets be reduced. This does not appear to be to the liking of European commission VP Valdis Dombrovakis who has said Greece must stick to the conditions of its existing bailout package. Tonight the ECB will decide whether Greek banks will maintain access to the ELA. Greek bonds have strengthened through the day, too, although prices are still show a high danger of default. It\u2019s 10-year debt is trading around a yield of 10.4% currently, down from 10.6% on Tuesday evening. Back in Athens, the main share index closed 1% higher as traders clung onto hopes that a deal will be reached. Financial stocks all rallied; Attica Bank gained 7.6%, National Bank of Greece finished 6.7% higher and Eurobank rose 6.1%. The United States has waded into the deadlock gripping the eurozone, by giving Greece a clear nudge to find a \u201cconstructive\u201d path towards a deal with its creditors, quickly. US Treasury secretary Jack Lew spoke with Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis today. He warned him that Greece would face \u201cimmediate hardship\u201d without an agreement, and that the current deadlock is \u201cnot good\u201d for Europe.. A Treasury official said that Lew: ....noted that failure to reach an agreement would lead to immediate hardship in Greece, that the uncertainty is not good for Europe, and that time is of the essence.\u201d That\u2019s quite an intervention from Lew, showing the concern in America that Europe\u2019s debt crisis is flaring up again. Greece could be dragged back into recession by the uncertainty over its bailout programme, rating agency Fitch has just warned. The risks of a policy mistake that sinks the chances of a negotiated agreement have risen, it believes, and predicted that Greece\u2019s government will probably have to compromise. In an article called \u201cGreek Brinkmanship Could Do Lasting Economic Damage\u201d, Douglas Renwick and Mark Brown warned that it will lower its forecast for real GDP growth in 2015 again. The damage to investor, consumer, and depositor confidence is increasing downside risks to growth and Greece\u2019s incipient economic recovery. It may take time to repair even if agreement with official creditors is reached in the coming days or weeks. This echoes 2012, when around 30% of deposit outflows from Greek banks in May and June were not recovered in the second half of the year, even as fears that Greece would leave the eurozone receded. The private sector also experienced a long period of limited or costly access to market financing. My colleague Alberto Nardelli has crunched the numbers, to work out when Greece\u2019s coffers might actually run dry without a new bailout deal. It\u2019s a tricky question. By one measure, Greece might have to start tapping emergency reserves on 24th February, to tide it into mid-March before it faces repayments to the IMF, and then other creditors. But the real crunch will be whether the European Central Bank keeps providing liquidity: If, and it\u2019s a big if, the ECB were to ever pull the plug on Greek banks, the country\u2019s financial system would collapse, and Greece itself would de facto lose its last line of credit. It is hard to see how the house of cards would not then come tumbling down. Simply put, Mario Draghi, the ECB president, holds a sword over Greece\u2019s head. Open Europe, the think tank, has helpfully broken down the differences between Greece\u2019s position and the eurogroup. What deal could be struck to keep Greece in the Eurozone? They reckon that the two sides are nowhere near agreement on pension reforms, or labour market reforms, or privatisations. But there is a good chance of agreement on Greece\u2019s fiscal surplus targets, changes to public administration, and a renewed crackdown on tax evasion. Bruno Waterfield of the Telegraph reckons we won\u2019t hear anything from the ECB about Greek liquidity until late tonight, if at all.... The early optimism in the financial markets is evaporating, after Greece revealed it will not submit its request for a loan extension until Thursday. Wall Street has opened lower, the FTSE 100 is now down 15 points, or 0.2%, and the Athens stock market is up just 0.8% (having jumped 2.7% at the open) A quick recap: Greece has confirmed that it will apply to extend its loan arrangement, to avoid running out of funds by the end of February with potentially disastrous results. However, the request is now not expected to arrive in Brussels until Thursday morning. That\u2019s a day later than planned, as the government fine-tunes its proposal. Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis insisted that Athens will not cave in to demands to extend its existing bailout: We believe the terms of the bailout cannot continue by any means.\u201d But Germany\u2019s finance ministry has warned that Greece cannot separate its loan from its bailout commitments. And European commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis was adamant today that Athens must stick to the conditions of its existing bailout. Dombrovskis also warned that he sees \u201cworrying tendencies\u2019 in Greece\u2019s economic and financial situation, and urged Athens not to make \u2018unilateral\u2019 moves to unravel its austerity programme while negotiations are ongoing. There is also political tension in Greece, where a government minister has hinted that an EU Summit may be needed fix the problem. And a hard-left group have blasted the new government for caving into pressure from Brussels, arguing that Greece should quit the \u201creactionary, undemocratic and authoritarian\u201d EU instead. Over in Brussels, technical officials are expected to hold a Working Group tomorrow. And another Eurogroup meeting could be called on Friday. To add to the fun, Greece has released the documents that it presented to the Eurogroup at two meetings this week. They show how Yanis Varoufakis promised to work with fellow finance ministers, but also insisted that Greece\u2019s new government cannot stick to the mistakes of the past. The files also outline Athens\u2019 proposal to run a smaller budget surplus, and to renegotiate its bailout targets on privatisations and reforming its public sector and labour markets. Varoufakis also committed to keeping Greece in the eurozone. Coming up later... The ECB will rule on whether, or not, to maintain the emergency liquidity assistance that is keeping Greek banks afloat. And the Greek parliament will decide whether to elect Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the former Conservative minister, as their new president. Greece\u2019s minister of state Alekos Flamboraris, a close aide of prime minister Alexis Tsipras, has stirred the waters this morning saying Greece may request an emergency EU summit is held because the Greek crisis is as much political as economic, Helena Smith reports. Speaking to the local radio channel Parapolitika, the minister said in the event that an extraordinary eurogroup wasn\u2019t called by the end of the week, Athens would request that EU leaders convene for an extraordinary summit \u201cas the issue is political.\u201d He told the radio station: \u201cAthens is not requesting an extension of the memorandum as the vote of the Greek people has abolished the memorandum..... \u201cOur country is asking that the extension of the loan agreement be agreed so that we can resolve a few things that are still outstanding.\u201d Such an extension would allow the Greek economy \u201cto breath\u201d he said \u201cas we will get some money.\u201d \u201cWe should meet [each other] mid-way in the road,\u201d he said adding that the German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble\u2019s tough stance was purely motivated by the ongoing negotiations. [On Monday night, eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem said European Council president Donald Tusk had no intention of calling a summit] The Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, speaking to Germany\u2019s public television network ZDF, said Athens planned to ask for an extension of European financing \u201cfor a few months\u201d so that stability was achieved to enable both sides \u201cto negotiate a new agreement.\u201d French finance minister Michel Sapin hopes that a Greece deal will be hammered out by the end of the week: AFP reports that Sapin told a cabinet meeting that: \u201cTalks have not yet been successful. France\u2019s objective is for a deal to be reached with Greece by the end of the week.\u201d It\u2019s official: Greece\u2019s application is going to land in Brussels inboxes tomorrow morning, not today as the government said early this morning: So why the change? Apparently the request still being polished In Athens the battle lines are being drawn. The ultra-left anti-capitalist Antarsia party has fired off an excoriating statement following the new government\u2019s decision to request an extension of its loan agreement last night. Under the headline \u201cIt is time to break away from the European Union\u201d Antarsia (which is to the left of Syriza and has strong representation on Greece\u2019s powerful trade union of civil servants ADEDY) has blasted the euro group and the Syriza-led government for its handling of the Greek crisis. \u201cWhat has happened has proved yet again that the EU is the most reactionary, undemocratic and authoritarian construct in Europe after Nazism,\u201d it announced today. \u201cWe have a Greek government that in reality accepts the overwhelming debt and the immediate obligations that derive from this, commits itself to [pulling off] a primary surplus (that is to say austerity) has asked for an extension of the current loan agreement and declared that it accepts 70 % of the memorandum.\u201d Even if the government pulls off its ultimate goal of coming up with \u201ca bridging agreement\u201d in the months ahead, the party warned that ultimately it will amount to kicking the can down the road. \u201cThe same problems will crop up again with the same result of austerity, privatisations and changes in the [domains of] labour and pension reforms,\u201d the ultra-leftists said. \u201cThe European Union\u2019s blackmailing is not the exception but the rule. There is no democratic EU, nor is there an EU of the people.\u201d (via Helena Smith in Athens) Crumbs. And the eurogroup think Yanis Varoufakis is hard work?.... The head of Greek opposition party To Potami (The River) has said Athens will file its application for a loan extension on Thursday, not today as expected. Stavros Theodorakis was speaking to reporters after a meeting with Greek prime minister Tsipras, where he learned that the proposal will include some costed economic reforms. Rumours are swirling that eurozone technical officials are going to hold talks tomorrow at a Working Group. They would lay the groundwork for a full eurogroup on Friday to discuss Greece\u2019s bailout. Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commission vice-president for the Euro, is discussing the Greek situation in Brussels now. There\u2019s a livefeed here. Dombrovskis is telling reporters that he sees \u201cworrying tendencies\u2019 in Greece\u2019s economic and financial situation. He\u2019s arguing that Greece should stick with its existing programme, and then both sides can look at the flexibility that is available. What do you think about the vote on social reforms scheduled for a vote in Athens on Friday? Dombrovskis replies that the eurogroup believes that Greece should refrain from unilateral action while negotiations are underway. Good news for UK holidaymakers (and eurozone exporters); sterling has hit a seven-year high against the euro this morning. One euro is now worth 73.67p, down from 74.3p last night, following today\u2019s strong UK unemployment report. The euro has also dipped by 0.36% against the US dollar, to $1.136. That\u2019s still higher than the 11-year low plumbed in January. Insiders in Athens say much of the focus now will be on the wording of whatever document is drawn up to keep debt-stricken Greece afloat, our correspondent Helena Smith says. Former minister for international economic relations, Constantine Papadopoulos, says although the new government is now focusing on the loan agreement it is fully aware that it will have to keep \u201cto the general spirit\u201d of the conditions on which rescue funds have been given Greece. Speaking to the Guardian Papadopoulos, who was responsible for the country\u2019s international economic relations when the crisis first broke, said: \u201cWhat we are hearing is that the government is making a tremendous effort to reach an agreement in order to ensure there is no abrupt break in our relations with our euro zone partners. It will request a sixth-month extension of the loan agreement which underpins the memorandum of understanding..... [That MoU is the \u20ac240bn bailout accord Athens has signed with creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF.] ....\u201cbut will do so avoiding the term memorandum of understanding which it cannot be seen to be adopting.\u201d Papadopoulos said negotiations in the coming days would inevitably focus on the terms of the agreement the Syriza-dominated government would sign with creditors. \u201cThey will focus on the conditions Greece must meet to have the funds released. They cannot be identical to what we had before but Athens also understands they cannot digress too much from the general spirit of [previous] conditions. \u201cGreece is is prepared to make commitments on a number of controversial issues,\u201d he added saying taxation and privatisation would be among them. Back in Berlin, German economy ministry has also warned that Greece\u2019s loan agreement cannot be separated from its reform commitments. In other words, no money without austerity. The battle lines are being drawn, even before Athens submits its request. European commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has told Germany magazine WirtschaftsWoche that he\u2019s helping to craft a deal. In an interview published this morning, Juncker says: \u201cI am working together with Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem to achieve an extension of the existing programme, in order to bridge the time until summer.\u201d Juncker added that \u201cIt goes without saying that all the financial obligations to the European and international partners must be respected\u201d. Germany\u2019s government has welcomed the news that Athens is applying for a loan extension today: Dan Davies, senior research advisor at Frontline Analysts, is tweeting as he reads though the Greek negotiation papers released a few minutes ago. He reckons the documents suggests that there could have, and should have, been more progress: And where\u2019s the detail which eurozone finance ministers will have expected? Dan also spotted that Greece talks about writing off around \u20ac70bn of tax arrears: (I think that\u2019s penalties for unpaid tax; which is owed by bankrupt firms, criminals, etc, and arguable unrecoverable). This lack of detail from Greece must have made it harder for the eurogroup to assess the concessions which Varoufakis was promising. But I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a reason to have ditched the Moscovici compromise altogether. The immediate impression from these documents is that Yanis Varoufakis talks a pretty good game at the eurogroup, but Greece\u2019s proposals are rather short of actual numbers. Classy move from the Greek government. It has published the proposals which Yanis Varoufakis took to the two eurogroup meetings of finance ministers, on 11 and 16 February. It is online here in English (via the invaluable Yannis Koutsomitis), and here in Greek (on Capital.Gr). It shows that at the first meeting, Greece\u2019s new finance minister promised to cooperate in good faith, to deliver economic reforms, and to fight corruption, while also ending Greece\u2019s debt trap. As we thought, he proposed running to a surplus of 1.5% of GDP (rather than 4.5%); more support for Greece\u2019s financial sector; the release of \u20ac1.9bn of funds to help with Greece\u2019s financing needs, plus an agreement to issue more short-term loans to cover looming bills. Then at the meeting on the 16th (which collapsed amid much rancour), Varoufakis insisted that Greece was \u201cready and willing\u201d to apply for an extension to its loan agreement, with various \u201csensible conditionalities\u201d. He argued that he could not simply agree to \u201cextend the current programme\u201d, having been elected on a promise to change it: He called on finance chiefs to agree to a three-to-six month agreement to explore the \u201ccommon ground\u201d between the two sides, and provide the short-term funding Athens needs. And a second \u2018non-paper\u2019, Greece said the technical work with eurogroup ministers had achieved \u201csome progress\u201d: But it also said there were \u201creal differences in logic\u201d on some issues, including labour market reform, public sector reform, and privatisations. They\u2019re all central to Greece\u2019s bailout programme, suggesting common ground was scarcer than hoped.... Reaction, and more highlights, to follow Greece\u2019s government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis has confirmed that Athens will formally ask for an extension to its loan agreement today, but not the austerity measures which it has vowed to reverse. Sakellaridis told Greece\u2019s Antenna TV that: \u201cWe believe the terms of the bailout cannot continue by any means.\u201d That appears to confirm that Greece may be trying to revive the compromise proposal pulled together by the European Commission earlier this week. That may well open up a new clash with some fellow eurozone members, including Germany [see our opening post for an explanation]. Sakellaridis also declined to give details of exactly what Greece will be asking for: \u201cLet\u2019s wait today for the request for an extension of the loan contract to be submitted by Finance Minister Varoufakis.\u201d \u201cAll along deliberations are going on to find common ground. We want to believe that we are on a good path. We are coming to the table to find a solution.\u201d (quotes via Reuters and AP) No reaction from other \u20ac-countries yet.... In other UK economic news, the Bank of England has revealed that one policymaker believes the BoE it is as likely to loosen monetary policy as tighten it. The minutes of the BOE\u2019s last meeting also show that all policymakers voted 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.5% this month. Today\u2019s UK unemployment report looks pretty decent. The number of people out of work fell by 97,000 in the October-December quarter, lowering the jobless rate to a new six-year low of 5.7%. And the number in work rose by 103,000 to 30.896 million, driving the employment rate up. So with wages picking up too, it\u2019s a nice pre-election gift for UK PM David Cameron Just in: Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has fallen to 5.7%, a new six year low. And average earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 1.7%, year-on-year, in the last three months of 2014. Including bonuses, they were up by 2.1%. That\u2019s ahead of inflation, showing that real wages are accelerating. Analysts at French bank BNP Paribas warns that the next few days will be lively: \u201cThe tone between Greece and other European partners (is) less harsh but an agreement is still far from being reached. We still expect an agreement will be reached before the end of February, but we also see room for volatility until that time.\u201d It\u2019s business as usual outside the Athens parliament today: Greek government bonds are continuing their recovery \u2013 the yield on its three-year debt has dropped to 17.6%, from 18.8% last night. Newsflashes from Athens: Greece\u2019s government has just confirmed that it will submit a request to extend its existing loan today. No details yet on what conditions Greece will offer in return; as explained in the opening post we think Athens wants to reheat the \u201cMoscovici compromise\u201d. That puts the ball firmly back into the eurogroup\u2019s court. Will Jeroen Dijsselbloem now call a eurogroup meeting on Friday to consider the plan? In other news... Swiss prosecutors have just said they\u2019re probing a local subsidiary of HSBC for suspected money laundering, according to AP: Greek government bonds are recovering this morning. The yield (effectively the interest rate) on its 10-year debt has fallen from 10.6% to 10.4%, meaning it is seen as slightly safer. The Greek three-year bond is also rallying a little. The Greek stock market is also enjoying a relief rally, with the ATG index up 2.7% in early trading. Optimism abounds, even though a) Athens hasn\u2019t submitted an application yet, and b) eurozone finance ministers may not accept a loan extension if it\u2019s not tied to bailout targets. Other European markets are also rising in early trading, with Germany\u2019s DAX gaining 0.5% and the French CAC up 0.7%. In London, the FTSE 100 index has hit its highest levels in 15 years, and is closing in on its record peak. The blue-chip index has gained 20 points to 6920, not far from the 6930-point level it closed at back in December 1999. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says Greek optimism is pushing shares higher: The positive open comes as talks between Greece and the Eurogroup continue this week with PM Tsipras indicating yesterday that, while he remains absolutely committed to forging an agreement with the creditors, the two parties remain far from striking a deal. Nonetheless, it is reported that the Syriza government may request a 6-month extension of its bailout today and that will no doubt calm the waters slightly. Eurozone ministers have another incentive to get a deal done quickly \u2013 it will spare them from any more lectures from George Osborne. Britain\u2019s chancellor raised hackles at yesterday\u2019s Ecofin meeting in Brussels, by asking fellow European Union finance ministers what alternative arrangements were being drawn up in case Greece ran out of funds. Bloomberg reports that this went down rather badly: \u201cThere was a minister this morning, a non-euro-zone member, who asked if we had thought about what would happen if Greece left the euro,\u201d French Finance Minister Michel Sapin told reporters. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s indecent.\u201d... Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who presided over Monday\u2019s negotiations, also told Osborne at Tuesday\u2019s gathering that there was no alternative to Greece staying in the euro area, one of the people said. Other ministers reacted with anger to Osborne\u2019s intervention, the person said. European stock markets are inching higher at the start of trading: One crucial point: Any Greek deal would need to be approved by other eurozone governments. And Germany is very likely to oppose a mere loan agreement, rather than a formal extension of the current bailout + conditions. lias Siakantaris, columnist at Greece\u2019s Kathimerini newspaper, tweets: Hopes that Greece might make a breakthrough with its creditors today drove Japan\u2019s stock index to its highest level since the financial crisis struck. The Nikkei gained 1.2%, or 212 points, to close at 18,199.17. That\u2019s the highest point since July 2007. Other Asian markets also picked up. Trading was thin because of Lunar New Year celebrations; the Manila stock exchange was the place to be: Good morning. The deadlock between Greece and its creditors could be broken today, if Athens bows to pressure and applies for a loan extension. But it may not be as simple as that. Greek government insiders revealed last night that they are poised to ask for an extension to its existing bailout, which runs out in just 10 days. However, it may not request an extension of all its bailout conditions - a crucial distinction. The proposal is due to be sent to Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem this morning; he\u2019ll then decide whether to call an extraordinary meeting of eurozone finance chiefs on Friday. The third in under two weeks... The Tsipras government doesn\u2019t appear to be caving in completely. Instead, based on the rumours floating around overnight, it appears to be attempting to revive the compromise plan pulled together on Monday by European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici. One source told us last night: \u201cWe are not going to ask for an extension of the programme or memorandum. The Greek government won\u2019t accept ultimatums.\u201d Greece to seek loan extension under pressure from eurozone And as the Financial Times explains, under this proposal: Greece would not roll back economic reforms; it would continue to run a primary budget surplus; it would pledge to pay its creditors in full. In exchange, Athens would be given leeway in deciding which reforms it would agree to. But it\u2019s far from certain that Dijsselbloem will accept the Moscovici deal being retrieved from the wastepaper basket. Monday night\u2019s meeting, you\u2019ll recall, collapsed when the eurogroup presented Greece with another proposal, to basically stick with its bailout. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank will decide today whether to keep granting Greek banks access to its Emergency Liquidity Assistance programme. They are unlikely to turn off this life-support right now, though. As Michael Hewson of CMC Markets puts it: ECB President Mario Draghi is unlikely to want to go down in history as the man who pulled the plug on Greece and undermine the \u201cirreversible\u201d nature of the euro. Also, the Greek parliament should be voting on its new president tonight. Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the former conservative minister nominated yesterday, is likely to be approved by MPs. And if that\u2019s not enough drama, we get the latest UK unemployment data at 9.30am GMT, and also the minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s most recent meeting.",

But it may not be as simple as that.</p> <p>Greek government insiders revealed last night that they are poised to ask for an extension to its existing bailout, which runs out in just 10 days.</p> <p><strong>However, it may not request an extension of all its bailout conditions - a crucial distinction.</strong></p> <p>The proposal is due to be sent to Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem this morning; he\u2019ll then decide whether to call an extraordinary meeting of eurozone finance chiefs on Friday. <em>The third in under two weeks</em>...</p> <p><strong>The Tsipras government doesn\u2019t appear to be caving in completely.</strong> Instead, based on the rumours floating around overnight, it appears to be attempting to revive <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheEIU_Europe/status/567926223600508928\">the compromise plan pulled together on Monday by European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici</a>.<br></p> <p>One source told us last night:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cWe are not going to ask for an extension of the programme or memorandum. The Greek government won\u2019t accept ultimatums.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/feb/17/greece-bailout-talks-george-osborne-says-its-crunch-time-for-the-eurozone\">Greece to seek loan extension under pressure from eurozone</a></h2> <p>And as the <strong>Financial Times </strong>explains, under this proposal: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Greece would not roll back economic reforms; it would continue to run a primary budget surplus; it would pledge to pay its creditors in full. In exchange, Athens would be given leeway in deciding which reforms it would agree to.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it\u2019s far from certain that Dijsselbloem will accept the Moscovici deal being retrieved from the wastepaper basket. Monday night\u2019s meeting, you\u2019ll recall, collapsed when the eurogroup presented Greece with another proposal, to basically stick with its bailout.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <strong>European Central Bank</strong> will decide today whether to keep granting Greek banks access to its <strong>Emergency Liquidity Assistance</strong> programme. They are unlikely to turn off this life-support right now, though.<br></p> <p>As <strong>Michael Hewson </strong>of<strong> CMC Markets </strong>puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>ECB President Mario Draghi is unlikely to want to go down in history as the man who pulled the plug on Greece and undermine the \u201cirreversible\u201d nature of the euro.</p> </blockquote> <p>Also, the Greek parliament should be voting on its new president tonight. Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the former conservative minister nominated yesterday, is likely to be approved by MPs.</p> <p><strong>And if that\u2019s not enough drama, </strong><strong>we get the latest UK unemployment data at 9.30am GMT, and also the minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s most recent meeting.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-02-18T07:43:34.884Z\">at 7.43am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

The 111-year-old marque, owned by German car firm BMW, said customers had asked it to add the as-yet unnamed vehicle to its existing saloon models \u2013 the Phantom, Ghost and Wraith - whose prices start at about \u00a3200,000. The company\u2019s chairman, Peter Schwarzenbauer and chief executive Torsten M\u00fcller-\u00d6tv\u00f6s said in a joint statement that the new car was not a radical departure for the venerable brand and that the move reflected Rolls-Royce\u2019s rugged roots. \u201cRolls-Royces conveyed pioneers and adventurers like Lawrence of Arabia across the vastness of unexplored deserts and over mountain ranges. In other parts of the world including Australia, India and the Americas, Rolls-Royces carried their owners over challenging terrain with absolute reliability and comfort. Rest assured, we are creating a motor car in the greatest traditions of our marque.\u201d Without mentioning SUV, 4x4 or other names normally used for off-road vehicles, Rolls-Royce\u2019s bosses said in an open letter that they would produce a high-bodied car that could cross any terrain. A spokesman said: \u201cThe words sport and utility don\u2019t feature in the Rolls-Royce lexicon and that was why it was important not to say those words and nor will we ever.\u201d After at least three years of planning, Rolls-Royce\u2019s team have come up with a design for the car, which will hit forecourts in 2017 or 2018. The company has been wary of undermining its brand but has seen competitors such as Porsche, Bentley and Jaguar go ahead with plans for their own models. Rolls-Royce said it had decided to produce the car after listening to its customers. With off-road cars the fastest growing part of the market, especially among wealthy customers, it was a request the company could not ignore. Global sales of premium and luxury SUVs rose from less than 397,000 in 2000 to 1.1m in 2007. Sales dipped during the credit crisis but hit a new peak of 1.2m last year and will rise to more than 1.3m by 2020, industry analyst IHS estimates. Off-road vehicles such as Land Rovers were originally designed for rough terrain but they have become popular with rich city dwellers, earning the nickname \u201cChelsea tractor\u201d. Luxury SUVs are also popular with newly wealthy people in developing markets such as India and Brazil, where roads outside big cities are often rough going. Ian Fletcher, an analyst at IHS, said: \u201cAt the high end, there are plenty of customers for these vehicles. A lot of customers who have a Rolls-Royce will have some sort of SUV in their fleet already. \u201cI\u2019m sure some old school customers will say this isn\u2019t necessary but the world is changing and they are looking for a younger audience and people who will be customers in the future.\u201d Rolls-Royce was founded in 1904 when Charles Rolls, a racing driver and car dealer, and engineer Sir Henry Royce teamed up. BMW acquired the brand in 1998 and relaunched Rolls-Royce, which is separate from the jet engine company of the same name, in 2003.",

Real wage increases, currently at the best levels in nearly seven years, represent a silver bullet for the wider UK recovery.</p> <p>Real wage increases come from optimistic employers happy with business conditions, they allow consumers to re-balance spending figures having taken on credit in leaner times and promote growth in generalised output with a central bank more comfortable to normalise monetary policy. Indeed, the Bank of England told us in their latest minutes that they expect to see CPI rising \u201cfairly sharply\u201d after the fall in oil drops out of the basket.</p> <p> All in all this is a corking jobs report; higher wages, lower unemployment mixed with lower inflation released yesterday is nothing but good news.</p> <h2><strong><br></strong></h2> <h2><strong>Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown</strong></h2> <p>Unemployment fell once more to a six-year low of 5.7% in the three months to December, ONS figures released today showed. 30.9m people were in work, an increase of 608,000 from a year earlier.<br></p> <p> Meaningful real wage growth is starting to emerge too. Average weekly earnings increased by 2.1% including bonuses and by 1.7% excluding bonuses in the three months to December compared with a year earlier. Combined with inflation at 0.3% and falling, this means the squeeze on household budgets is beginning to ease significantly.</p> <p> The Bank of England [in minutes published on Wednesday] noted that the pickup in pay growth has been faster than it had anticipated. It previously said that it wants to see a marked increase in pay before judging that sufficient labour market slack has been eroded for interest rates to rise. </p> <p>If pay growth continues to improve, this removes a key barrier to higher interest rates. However, given that inflation is expected to fall below zero in the coming months, and stay close to zero for the rest of the year, there is no pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates in the short term. </p> <p>Indeed, Mark Carney indicated last week that the Bank would even consider cutting rates if deflation looked like it was becoming entrenched. With inflation likely to pick up once the effect of the drop in oil prices falls out of the year-on-year calculation, a cut in rates looks most unlikely, but I don\u2019t see them rising until mid-2016 at the earliest.</p> <h2><strong>Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club</strong></h2> <p>December\u2019s rise was not enough to prevent real pay in 2014 as a whole dropping by 0.3%. This left real pay in 2014 down more than 8% on its 2007 level, the largest seven-year fall in inflation-adjusted earnings since records began in the middle of the nineteenth century.<br></p> <p>Looking forward, falling unemployment may put further upward pressure on pay rises. But the capacity of firms to accommodate those rises from rising productivity continues to be lacking, with the UK\u2019s dismal productivity performance showing little sign of improving. <br></p> <p>Total hours worked grew by 0.8% in Q4, exceeding growth in GDP of 0.5% and implying that output per hour fell in the quarter.<br></p>",

Indeed, the Bank of England told us in their latest minutes that they expect to see CPI rising \u201cfairly sharply\u201d after the fall in oil drops out of the basket. All in all this is a corking jobs report; higher wages, lower unemployment mixed with lower inflation released yesterday is nothing but good news. Ben Brettell, senior economist, Hargreaves Lansdown Unemployment fell once more to a six-year low of 5.7% in the three months to December, ONS figures released today showed. 30.9m people were in work, an increase of 608,000 from a year earlier. Meaningful real wage growth is starting to emerge too. Average weekly earnings increased by 2.1% including bonuses and by 1.7% excluding bonuses in the three months to December compared with a year earlier. Combined with inflation at 0.3% and falling, this means the squeeze on household budgets is beginning to ease significantly. The Bank of England [in minutes published on Wednesday] noted that the pickup in pay growth has been faster than it had anticipated. It previously said that it wants to see a marked increase in pay before judging that sufficient labour market slack has been eroded for interest rates to rise. If pay growth continues to improve, this removes a key barrier to higher interest rates. However, given that inflation is expected to fall below zero in the coming months, and stay close to zero for the rest of the year, there is no pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates in the short term. Indeed, Mark Carney indicated last week that the Bank would even consider cutting rates if deflation looked like it was becoming entrenched. With inflation likely to pick up once the effect of the drop in oil prices falls out of the year-on-year calculation, a cut in rates looks most unlikely, but I don\u2019t see them rising until mid-2016 at the earliest. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club December\u2019s rise was not enough to prevent real pay in 2014 as a whole dropping by 0.3%. This left real pay in 2014 down more than 8% on its 2007 level, the largest seven-year fall in inflation-adjusted earnings since records began in the middle of the nineteenth century. Looking forward, falling unemployment may put further upward pressure on pay rises. But the capacity of firms to accommodate those rises from rising productivity continues to be lacking, with the UK\u2019s dismal productivity performance showing little sign of improving. Total hours worked grew by 0.8% in Q4, exceeding growth in GDP of 0.5% and implying that output per hour fell in the quarter.",

Speaking at the Rolls Royce car factory in Goodwood, Sussex where the luxury car firm has just announced plans to build an SUV, Cameron said: \u201cI\u2019m not saying we have solved all our problems in the British economy in the last four and a half years, but we are on our way.\u201d Employment increased by 103,000 in the three months to December, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), driving the employment rate to 73.2%, as the economy continued to grow. The ONS said that this figure was higher than the pre-crisis peak of 73%, recorded in early 2008, and has only been matched once, in 2005, since records began more than 30 years ago. The prime minister has said he wants to create full employment, and the latest rise will boost his hopes of stoking a feelgood factor in the runup to the general election in May. The ONS pointed out that the record employment rate for women, at 68.5%, partly reflected the increase in the state pension age, \u201cresulting in fewer women retiring between the ages of 60 and 65\u201d. Unemployment fell by 97,000 over the three-month period to 1.86 million, the ONS said, and average wages rose at the fastest pace since mid-2013. The unemployment rate continued to decline, to 5.7%. Measured on the claimant count, which only includes the number of people in receipt of out-of-work benefits, unemployment also fell, by 36,300 in the month to January, to 843,100. Average pay including bonuses was up by 2.1% on an annual basis, the ONS said. With inflation running at an annual rate of just 0.5% in December, that confirmed that the long-running squeeze on living standards has come to an end for the time being. John Philpott, the director of The Jobs Economist, pointed out that without factoring in bonuses, pay growth remained relatively weak, at 1.7%. \u201cAlthough the December bonus season pushed growth in total average weekly earnings above 2%, underlying pay pressure as measured by regular average weekly earnings fell slightly. \u201cThis suggests that the jobs rich economic recovery is still failing to boost labour productivity, which does not bode well for long-term improvement in UK living standards, even if very low price inflation is at present helping to raise real incomes,\u201d he said.",
