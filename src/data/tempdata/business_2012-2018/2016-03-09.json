      "bodyText": "The head of Volkswagen in the US resigned \u201ceffective immediately\u201d on Wednesday night as the company struggles to agree on a settlement with the US government over its emissions cheating scandal. Michael Horn, who had served as VW\u2019s US president and chief executive since 2014, was not quoted in the company\u2019s three-paragraph statement announcing his immediate exit from the firm after more than 25 years of service. VW said Horn\u2019s resignation was by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d and he would be \u201cleaving to pursue other opportunities effective immediately\u201d. The company did not explain why Horn was leaving the company now \u2013 six months after VW was caught using \u201cdefault device\u201d software to systematically cheat on US regulators\u2019 tests. Martin Winterkorn, the global CEO of VW, resigned in September 2015 in the near-immediate aftermath of the scandal, which has wiped billions of euros of VW\u2019s market value and left the company facing fines of as much as $20bn and a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice. It was revealed last week that Winterkorn was told about the illegal emissions crisis more than a year before the company admitted it to regulators. Horn has at times appeared frustrated with the German company\u2019s handling of the crisis. When he was called before the US Congress in October, he denied any prior knowledge of the software, and said its installation was not a corporate decision. \u201cI agree it\u2019s very hard to believe,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cPersonally, I struggle too.\u201d Herbert Diess, CEO of Volkswagen brand, said: \u201cI want personally to say \u2018thank you\u2019 to Michael Horn for the great work he has done for the brand and with the dealers in the United States. During his time in the US, Michael Horn built up a strong relationship with our national dealer body and showed exemplary leadership during difficult times for the brand.\u201d Horn will be replaced on an interim basis by Hinrich Woebcken, who was recently appointed head of VW in North America. A federal judge has given the company until 24 March to reach an agreement with the government on recalling the affected vehicles. Both state and federal regulators will have to sign off on any planned recall. VW has not indicated whether it will be able to meet the deadline. The \u201cdefeat device\u201d, which dramatically reduced VW diesel emissions only when cars were undergoing regulatory tests not when they were on the road, was installed in 6000,000 vehicles in the US and 11m across the world. VW has set aside \u20ac6.7bn to deal with the costs of recalling and fixing cars across the world, but penalties in the US lawsuit could cost Volkswagen more than $30,000 per vehicle, which could total as much as $20bn. Analysts have warned that the total cost of the scandal could be as high as \u20ac78bn, which would be 60% more than the Deepwater Horizon disaster cost BP.",

      "bodyText": "While the prices of Australia\u2019s major export commodities fell throughout 2015, international tourist and student numbers saw a huge jump largely off the back of a 35% increase in Chinese visitors. And best of all for the Australian economy, Chinese visitors spend more than anyone else. The swings and roundabouts of the economy really become apparent when you look at the exchange rate. The low Australia dollar helps exporters, as it makes our goods relatively cheaper compared with other nations, but when that lower dollar is largely being driven by low prices for commodities it\u2019s not a great help to our largest exporters of iron ore and other minerals. But the low dollar is absolute manna from heaven for the tourism and educational industries. A low dollar makes international travel more expensive, thus keeping more Australian tourists at home rather than overseas, and it makes coming to Australia a very inviting proposition for those from overseas. The same holds for international students \u2013 the lower our dollar is, the further their home currency stretches. Despite some recent upticks in the strength of our currency, from 2013 through to 2015 the value of the dollar fell against most of our trading partners: These falls have led to a reinvigoration of our tourism sector, with last year seeing an 11% rise in the number of short-term international visitors, almost 40% of which was due to visitors from China: In 2015 there were 531,700 more short-term arrivals than in 2014 and 196,700 came from China. In the 12 months to January 2016 there were 564,200 more arrivals than in the 12 months to January 2015 and 210,400 (37%) of those came from China. In January overall there were 66,200 more visitors to Australia than there was in the same month in 2015, and 26,600 of those came from China. China is fast approaching New Zealand as the largest source of visitors, and that is good news for our economy because Chinese visitors bring more money than those from other nations. The reason is the type of visitors. Not everyone comes to Australia for a holiday. Some come to visit relatives and friends (still a holiday, but one more likely to seeing people staying a bit longer but spending a bit less because they spend more time staying in someone\u2019s house rather than a hotel), others are here for business, some for employment and for education. The big growth in the past year has been for employment and education, with holidays coming in third. But in terms of sheer numbers, holidaying is the overwhelming reason why people come to Australia for a short visit. Thus while there has been a 14% increase in such visits, that accounted for two-thirds of the total increase in visitors into Australia throughout 2015: But while numbers are great, and it is wonderful that people like to come to our country, what really matters from an economic sense is that they come with money to spend. Foreign visitors spending money in Australia actually counts as exports as it is essentially money coming into our economy. And on this score, as with the other big Australian export of minerals, China is the dominant player: According to Tourism Research Australia, spending by Chinese visitors in 2015 grew by a staggering 48% over 2014, and accounted for a quarter of all spending. And while Chinese visitors are the biggest spenders as a group, they are also the biggest spenders on average: This is because of the reasons Chinese come to Australia. As the largest proportion of people coming to Australia do so for a holiday, such visitors account for the largest share of spending. Holiday-makers spent $14.3bn while in Australia in 2015, compared with $8.7bn spent by those here for education reasons: But those who are here for their education spend a great deal more on average than any other group \u2013 $17,721 per person in 2015 compared with $8,008 by those here for employment and just $2,499 by those here for a holiday. And this is where the Chinese really jump out as the big spenders. Where 64% of Japanese visitors are here for a holiday, only 54% of Chinese are. Similarly while 43% of those from the UK and 34% from New Zealand are here to see family or friends, only 20% of Chinese visitors are. While a mere 2% of visitors from across the Tasman or from the UK are here to attend education, 15% of Chinese are here to study: The importance of Chinese to our education export market is clear when we compare the number of Chinese student here each year since 2005 with students from other nations: And what is more, those Chinese students also spend more on average than most other student visitors. While the big spending holiday-makers are those from the UK ($3,958 on average in 2015), in all other categories Chinese visitors spend the most: It all adds up to a nice export earner and one that will continue to rise in importance as the Chinese middle class continues to grow. Given travel services account for nearly 15% of our exports \u2013 almost as much as the rural sector \u2013 it will continue to be a valuable part of our economy especially due to the labour-intensive nature of tourism-related services: Given the importance of the Chinese market to our tourism and educational sector, you can also be sure it is one that won\u2019t be taken for granted by governments, businesses or universities. Australian might have a heck of a lot of iron ore and coal compared with most nations, but we don\u2019t have any comparative advantage on universities or tourist spots. And it is always worth remembering that while we are relatively close to parts of China, a flight from Beijing to Heathrow is 20 minutes shorter than one to Sydney.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "No 10 has conceded that its plans to relax Sunday trading laws are dead in the water, after David Cameron suffered his biggest Commons defeat since the election at the hands of his own Conservative MPs. The government\u2019s attempt to let larger shops trade for longer than six hours each Sunday was voted down after 27 Tory backbenchers teamed up with Labour and the SNP. It lost by 31 votes after Cameron failed to reach a compromise with unconvinced MPs, who argued that it was necessary to \u201ckeep Sunday special\u201d and protect family time for shop workers. The defeat is the second of this parliament in the Commons for Cameron, and the first major one since his failure to win a vote on military action in Syria in 2013. His first loss of the parliament was a vote won by Tory Eurosceptics and Labour over the \u201cpurdah\u201d rules governing the EU referendum in September. Downing Street was quick to blame the SNP, whose MPs helped scupper the measures relating to England and Wales even though Sunday trading laws are already relaxed in Scotland. But the real damage to the government was done by 27 of its MPs, whose rebellion underlined Cameron\u2019s weakened grasp over his parliamentary party and highlighted the fractious mood of backbenchers in the run-up to next week\u2019s budget and June\u2019s referendum on membership of the European Union. The defeat was particularly painful because ministers had offered to significantly water down the plans by rolling them out in only 12 pilot areas, in a last-ditch attempt to stave off the rebellion. However, the government submitted its amendment too late to the Speaker, John Bercow, and MPs were unwilling to accept a promise by Brandon Lewis, a communities minister, that the concession would be introduced in the House of Lords. It is understood No 10 then rang round Tory MPs to try to bring them onside, but was unable to persuade enough to make a difference to the result. After the vote, Downing Street sources confirmed they were conceding defeat and there were no plans to proceed with more pilot schemes or find a way to circumvent the SNP\u2019s opposition. The source said it was a clear result so they would not expect there was any way forward. The plan would have allowed local councils to make a decision about whether to let larger stores stay open for longer than six hours on Sundays, which ministers said could benefit the UK economy by an estimated \u00a31.5bn or more over 10 years. But the successful rebellion was led by David Burrowes, who laid an amendment to kill off the plans completely by striking them from the legislation. The Burrowes amendment was supported by 317 MPs from across the parties, including Labour, the SNP, the DUP, some Tories and some Lib Dems, while 286 voted against it. Speaking against the plans, Burrowes said: \u201cWe have a job to do in parliament, we don\u2019t just devolve every decision out to our constituents. \u201cIf we listen to our constituents \u2026 I have many shopworkers, many faith groups and many others saying: why are we doing this? Why are we trying to unpick something that\u2019s fairly settled? \u201cThat\u2019s me listening to my constituents. But also we have important principles as well. Those are complex arrangements for Sunday trading and it\u2019s a duty on us to look at it carefully, to consult widely and also scrutinise it fairly. \u201cNone of those things have happened to the regard that did happen back in the 1990s and 1980s. It shouldn\u2019t surprise us that we are in this situation now where there is a lot of concern, a lot of cross-party concern.\u201d Ministers had hoped to avoid a defeat by doing a deal with the SNP but the party decided on Tuesday night to vote against the measures \u2013 giving the government little time to thrash out a compromise with Tory rebels. The SNP said it acted to avoid a \u201cknock-on impact to Scottish workers who would be at risk of pay cuts\u201d. Responding for the government, Sajid Javid, the business secretary, said he respected the will of MPs, who opposed the measures out of principle, despite the \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d result. However, he condemned the \u201cchildish and hypocritical actions of the SNP\u201d, saying it had sought to deny shoppers in the rest of the UK the same freedoms enjoyed in Scotland and pointing out that a majority of English and Welsh MPs had voted in favour. Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said it was Labour which had led the charge against the government\u2019s plans to deregulate Sunday trading. \u201cWe support the current arrangements, which work well and mean retailers can trade, customers can shop, and shopworkers can spend time with their families,\u201d she said. \u201cI warned the government that unless they pulled their plans then they would face a public and humiliating defeat on the floor of the House of Commons. That is exactly what we have delivered. \u201cThe government must now listen to the settled will of the House of Commons and confirm that they will not attempt to bring back these plans, which were not in the Tory election manifesto, for a third time.\u201d The defeat was greeted with delight by John Hannett, the general secretary of the shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw. \u201cThis is the third occasion in five years that Conservative ministers have attempted to permanently change Sunday trading regulations and the third time they have been unsuccessful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe hope now the government will leave this great British compromise alone and focus on providing real support for the retail sector, not the unwanted and unnecessary bureaucracy that devolution would have resulted in. \u201cThe current Sunday trading rules are a fair compromise, which has worked well for over 20 years.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "John Lewis is planning to shut staff canteens and introduce longer shifts for hundreds of delivery drivers as part of efforts to cut costs and modernise its business. New contracts, which are currently under discussion, will also include a contractual requirement to work on Sundays and Bank Holidays if required. The John Lewis depots currently don\u2019t operate on those days, and the company said there was no immediate plan to change that. The changes emerged as the retail group is expected to reveal another cut in its staff bonus this year to around 9%, from 11% in 2015, after a period of tough trading for its Waitrose supermarket chain and a hit from higher pension charges. John Lewis staff, known as partners, receive a share of profits every year and own the company via a trust. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, said he expected annual pretax profits at the group to drop to about \u00a3300m from \u00a3343m last year. The cuts will affect about 700 drivers, who deliver to homes from 20 delivery hubs around the country. John Lewis is also reviewing the position of dozens of admin staff at the hub and once source said the company might consider centralising their role at head office. Less than 40 staff who work in canteens at the hubs are already in consultation about job losses. The canteens will be replaced by vending machines and other self-service equipment. The cut reflects a similar move by Asda, which is consulting on the closure of about 350 staff canteens in its stores and planning to axe free tea and toast for staff in a further 230 outlets. In a briefing document for drivers seen by the Guardian, John Lewis said the planned changes would create 50% more delivery slots on Mondays and Saturdays, and cut \u201cunproductive time\u201d for drivers, helping the retailer save \u00a36m a year. It said the introduction of seven-day contracts would mean John Lewis could deliver on Sundays in future and spread resources more evenly across the week. One driver affected by the changes said: \u201cI love my job but these changes could make it really difficult to pick up the kids from school. Someone sitting in a comfy office has said let\u2019s change these hours. Customers will think this is not the John Lewis I know.\u201d He said the rota changes also reduced the potential for earning overtime pay which many drivers currently use to top up their income . He said some delivery drivers were paid close to the minimum wage. A spokeswoman for John Lewis said: \u201cCustomers increasingly want flexible shopping and delivery times. As a result, we are talking to our driver partners about changing their working patterns to work fewer days in a week but more hours in a day. We believe the changes will meet the needs of our customers better. \u201cWe do not take any decision to change our partners working practices lightly. We have engaged our partners through the Partnership\u2019s democratic channels, and have had many positive responses.",

      "bodyText": "The energy company behind the Hinkley Point nuclear project has still not signed off a contract with its Chinese partner that is needed for the \u00a318bn plant to go ahead. EDF Energy and China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGNPC) reached an outline deal that was unveiled last October by David Cameron during a state visit by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. But five months on the companies have not finalised the agreement, amid growing doubts over EDF\u2019s commitment to the project. When the outline deal was announced, the French state-owned power company said construction work could begin within weeks. However, it has now emerged that the delay in EDF taking the final investment decision on Hinkley is not just because of well-publicised financing concerns in France, but also because there is no legally binding contract with Beijing. The French energy company has found it has taken longer than expected to do due diligence on state-owned CGNPC\u2019s ability to make its \u00a36bn contribution to the Somerset power scheme. \u201cThe complexity of the issue is hard to imagine. There are dozens of different legal agreements and literally thousands of pages,\u201d said one nuclear industry source. The source added that the agreements also apply to projects at Sizewell and Bradwell. EDF has brought CGNPC into a post-Hinkley deal for a new reactor at Sizewell in Suffolk and plans to help the company construct its Chinese-designed reactors at Bradwell in Essex. The delays are said to have been prolonged by breaks for Christmas and Chinese new year but sources said EDF was close to reaching a final legal deal that both sides can sign off on. EDF declined to comment. However, the hold-up comes as EDF is still trying to convince the French government it has enough cash to meet the \u20ac1.8bn annual payments it needs for Hinkley \u2013 even with the Chinese taking a 33% stake. Last week the EDF finance director, Thomas Piquemal, resigned from the company amid reports he could not support the project going ahead for at least three years until EDF\u2019s finances were in better shape. Despite the upheaval, and the firm opposition to Hinkley from trade union members of the EDF board, the company is attempting to deliver final approval at the start of April. But a procession of deadlines for the scheme, which if built could provide 7% of Britain\u2019s electricity, have come and gone. And many in the City of London believe the project will never happen because it is too expensive for the British consumer who will eventually end up paying back EDF via energy bills. Hinkley Point is a flagship policy for the Conservative government at a time when other energy initiatives have been foundering and there are increasing concerns that the lights will go out. Sir Ed Davey, the former energy secretary, who negotiated a much-criticised subsidy regime for the power generated by Hinkley, said the Conservatives would have been willing to pay even more than he agreed. The government will pay \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for Hinkley electricity, which at the time of the CNGPC announcement was double the UK wholesale price. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Davey said: \u201cThey [the Conservatives] were gagging for nuclear. George Osborne in particular was wanting to have Chinese investment, big infrastructure projects to show off to the Tory backbenchers. It was me saying \u2018I\u2019m going to walk away from this deal if we don\u2019t do what we promised parliament\u2019, and that meant we had to get the price down to below \u00a390 per megawatt hour, which I did.\u201d The government disputes Davey\u2019s account of events. A government source told the Times that Conservative ministers lost faith in Davey\u2019s negotiating skills and insisted on Treasury involvement in the deal. But Davey pointed out that negotiations in 2013 were led by his permanent secretary at the energy department. He said: \u201cMy permanent secretary was the person I appointed to run it, and he worked with the Treasury because the Treasury were involved. But I was the one who was prepared to walk away.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "This time last year shares in G4S were 300p, surpassing their level of 2012, the calamity year in which the firm failed to supply enough security guards to the London Olympics. Ashley Almanza, the chief executive recruited to bring order to the sprawling empire built by predecessor Nick Buckles, seemed to be halfway to success. He\u2019d put some muscle into the balance sheet with an early rights issue \u2013 \u00a3350m in 2013 \u2013 and the rest of the job seemed to be a decluttering exercise to restore G4S to its security roots. Buckles\u2019s disjointed vision of G4S as a jack-of-all-trades outsourcer would soon be forgotten. The picture looks very different now. The share price stands at 187p, down 12% on Wednesday; G4S is out of the FTSE 100 index; and the past still haunts the business. On a flattering definition, G4S\u2019s earnings rose 14% to \u00a3227m in 2015; on a statutory basis, there was a slump from \u00a3145m to just \u00a38m. Almanza\u2019s desire for \u201cfocus\u201d and \u201cdiscipline\u201d remains, but it\u2019s hard to concentrate when there are contracts like the one to house asylum seekers in the UK. G4S is struggling with a \u201cmaterial increase\u201d in the number of asylum seekers and is obliged to foot hotel bills when its can\u2019t find suitable accommodation. The result was a \u00a320m increase in the provision to cover losses until August next year; but if the Home Office extends the contract by two years, as it can, G4S estimates further losses of \u00a357m. With numbers like that flying around, G4S ought to be conservatively financed. But the figure that scared the City was a rise in debt to \u00a31.78bn, about 3.3 times earnings before all nasties. Almanza is flogging unwanted business as fast as he can (23 gone since 2013; 38 still to go) but that debt ratio still looks too high. This corporate recovery story has veered seriously off track. The City is right to fear another rights issue. BHS pensioners still need Sir Philip What was it Sir Philip Green said when he sold BHS for \u00a31 almost a year ago today? Oh, yes: \u201cI am deeply proud of the work ethic displayed by the very many people I have worked with for so long at BHS, both within our head office and across the stores.\u201d The great retailing knight now has a chance to express his gratitude in more than mere words. To the surprise of almost nobody, BHS has not prospered under the ownership of Retail Acquisitions, the obscure outfit to which Green sold the department store chain. BHS has filed for a form of insolvency and current and former employees face deep cuts in their pensions. Green, reportedly, has offered \u00a380m as a contribution to BHS\u2019s underfunded pension scheme. Before we call that generous, let\u2019s see the size of the underfunding. If the hole is much bigger, Green should be asked to find more. The management of BHS under its new owner is plainly not his concern, but, when you\u2019re selling a loss-making business with a large pensions deficit, your moral responsibilities to pensioners should not evaporate within 12 months. The Green family enjoyed \u00a3400m of dividends from BHS in happier days. A substantial contribution would be the honourable course \u2013 but substantial may mean more than \u00a380m. Ashley must go direct to Westminster The problem for Mike Ashley is that declining an invitation to appear before MPs isn\u2019t a practical option for long. Sports Direct\u2019s founder got away with it last year, insisting he was too busy and then dispatching his chairman, Keith Hellawell, to bat against the Scottish affairs committee. With the business committee, his tactic was to offer a personal tour of the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse. No thanks, committee chair Iain Wright has now replied, we\u2019ll do this on our turf, in Westminster and in public; and, by the way, you may be in contempt of parliament if you still decline to come. At this point, even Ashley should realise that procrastination has reached its limit. If his appearance turns into a battle of wills, the MPs will win. Ashley\u2019s best approach now is to accept that he should go and get on top of every detail. The rest of us should hope the MPs also do their homework. Back in 2007, a different committee was terribly pleased with its power to summon the bosses of the private equity industry but incapable of handling vaguely technical answers. The result was three hours of frustration on all sides.

    "webTitle": "BHS pensioners face cuts to payouts as struggling chain goes into insolvency", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Thousands of BHS pensioners are to have their pension entitlement cut after the retailer launched insolvency proceedings. Nearly 13,000 current and former BHS employees who are under retirement age will have their pensions cut by 10%. Those who have already retired but are still below the official retirement age will have their pension payments cut within months. It is not currently clear how many people this will affect. A handful of staff \u2013 less than a dozen \u2013 are facing much more substantial cuts. The majority of BHS\u2019s 6,700 existing pensioners will not see any change to their payments as they are above retirement age. Those receiving a pension because of ill health or one linked to a deceased relative will also not be affected. Last week, BHS filed a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a type of insolvency proceeding, at the high court in an attempt to restructure its finances. The proceedings trigger regulatory rules under which pension trustees are only allowed to pay scheme members the amount they would receive if the scheme had to be rescued by the government-backed Pension Protection Fund \u2013 which is 90% of their current benefits. The PPF is currently assessing BHS\u2019s fund, and that process could take up to two years. If the BHS scheme does go into the PPF \u201clifeboat\u201d then the cuts to pensioners\u2019 payments will be permanent. Chris Martin, chairman of BHS\u2019s pension fund trustees, said: \u201cIt seems very unlikely to me that pensioners will receive anything other than the PPF level of benefits in future even if the CVA is successful ... The scheme is so underfunded it won\u2019t change the outcome.\u201d The PPF is understood to be in discussions with retail tycoon Sir Philip Green, BHS\u2019s former owner, about support for the pension fund. One report claimed Green had offered to pay an \u00a380m contribution. Green\u2019s Arcadia group is already committed to paying \u00a315m into the scheme over three years. While the changes to pension payments apply from the first day that BHS filed for its CVA, no pension payments will be changed immediately. Martin said all of those affected would be informed before their payments were reduced and that process would take several months. The next payroll is on 1 April. Martin said: \u201cWe intend to send communication out to members later this week or early next week and then we will start an orderly process of adjusting payments to PPF levels.\u201d Green sold BHS for \u00a31 in March to a little-known collection of financiers, lawyers and accountants. Since then concerns about the future of the retailer, which employs more than 10,000 staff, have grown. It emerged the man who led the buyout, Dominic Chappell, is a former bankrupt, while credit insurers have refused to support BHS\u2019s suppliers, meaning the retailer had to pay upfront for stock. Under the CVA scheme, which must be approved by creditors later this month, BHS told landlords it would have to shut 40 stores if rents cannot be reduced by 75%. It is seeking reductions of up to 50% at a further 47 stores. It says it can continue to pay full rent at only 77 stores. One major landlord said he was unlikely to back the deal as BHS was already \u201cdeeply embedded in the mire and there was no point in prolonging the agony\u201d. But other landlords are thought be keen to back the scheme rather than be stuck with empty stores. This article was amended on 10 March 2016. An earlier version said the Pension Protection Fund has powers to pursue related parties for additional funding for struggling pension schemes. Only the Pensions Regulator has those powers.",

That\u2019s not surprising, since in the years leading up to the start of the financial crisis in 2007 few people were employed on one. Today, after an eightfold increase in the past 10 years, everybody knows what a zero-hours contract is and what it represents. It is a symbol of an increasingly insecure labour market in which the balance of power is tilted decisively in favour of employers. The fact that zero-hours contracts have their own acronym (ZHC) shows how widespread they have become. In 2005, there were 100,000 workers on contracts that did not guarantee a minimum number of hours. The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics show that by the end of 2015 there were 801,000. Somewhat surprisingly, the big increase in ZHCs was not during the Great Recession itself, when the number of people on them doubled to 200,000. Instead, it has been the period when the economy has been recovering from its longest and deepest slump since the second world war that their use has rocketed. Initially, the argument was that ZHCs were a response to the sluggish and uneven nature of Britain\u2019s recovery, and they would become less prevalent as unemployment decreases. This argument looks less tenable now that the jobless rate is back to its pre-recession level. In the past year alone, the number of zero-hours contract workers has increased by 15%. Let\u2019s be clear. Some workers like ZHCs because they provide flexibility. Tens of thousands have been with their current employers for 10 years or more. Similarly, many people at university find that a ZHC dovetails well with their studies. Even after the sharp rise since 2012, people on zero-hours contracts account for just 2.5% of those in employment. That said, this is not just a question of an undergraduate taking a couple of hours\u2019 break from their essay on Hamlet to pull pints down the local pub. While 10% of workers overall say they would like to work longer hours, the figure rises to 37% for those on ZHCs. TUC research has shown that average weekly earnings for zero-hours workers are \u00a3188 compared to \u00a3479 for permanent staff, and that two-fifths earn less than the \u00a3111 a week needed to qualify for statutory sick pay.

      "bodyText": "And finally...the European stock markets have closed slightly higher, as all eyes turn to tomorrow\u2019s European Central Bank meeting. Mario Draghi is expected to announce new stimulus measures - perhaps deeper negative interest rates, and another splurge of quantitative easing to drag inflation above zero again. Here\u2019s Barbara Teixeira Araujo, economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, say: We believe the ECB will cut its deposit rate from -0.3% to -0.5% and expand its bond-buying program, as the pressure for it to act ramps up amid recent financial turmoil and sluggish growth in the euro area\u2019s main economies.\u201d The ECB president may also attempt one of his famous jawboning sessions to reassure investors, and perhaps weaken the euro. And that leaves investors nervous, having been disappointed in December. Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, explains: As John Cleese observed in \u2018Clockwise\u2019, it\u2019s not the despair that gets you, it\u2019s the hope. Traders have learned the wisdom of that observation over the past three days, as stock markets continue to oscillate in relatively tight ranges. In one sense, this is due entirely to the ECB \u2013 no one wants to get caught out with aggressive positioning ahead of a potentially decisive meeting tomorrow. Either that, or we are simply having to endure the inevitable consolidation period that follows a significant rally. Either way, most investors have opted to sit on their hands. At least now we have fewer than 24 hours to go until we know Mario Draghi\u2019s mind. So the FTSE 100 has just closed up 20 points, or 0.35%, at 6146. Prudential was the biggest riser, up 2.6%, after it posting a 22% jump in profits and announced a special dividend. Burberry shares were firmly out of fashion. They slumped by 6.7% after it emerged that it isn\u2019t facing a mystery takeover bid after all. And across Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index finished 0.5% higher. Goodnight, and thanks for reading and commenting. GW Britain\u2019s growth rate has dropped to just 0.3% in the last three months, according to the latest research from The National Institute Of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). NIESR estimated that growth weakened in the December-February quarter, down from the 0.4% seen in November-January. It\u2019s also a slowdown compared to the 0.5% growth that was officially recorded in the final three months of last year. NIESR\u2019s data shows that the UK economy hit a sticky patch in December, a time when global slowdown fears were rising. It also sees signs that growth picked up since. Jack Meaning, research fellow at NIESR, says: It looks as if output growth at the start of 2016 has been subdued. However, it appears that December 2015 may have been a low point for GDP and as this drops out of the calculation of quarterly growth rates, output growth for the first quarter may strengthen slightly.\u201d Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity International, is concerned by the slowdown: Back in parliament, Steve Baker MP has accused the Bank of England of being at \u201csixes and sevens\u201d over the Brexit issue, following Clara Furse and Richard Sharp\u2019s testimony today. Baker supports the campaign to leave the EU. Anti-austerity protests are also underway in Athens this afternoon, against the economic reforms contained in the Greek bailout. Two former government ministers who broke away from the government last summer, Panagiotis Lafazanis and Dimitris Stratoulis, are taking part: The Treasury committee is now examining Richard Sharp, ahead of his reappointment to the FPC. Like Dame Clara Furse, Sharp has neglected to mention Brexit in his homework. But he takes a different view - arguing that it isn\u2019t a long-term financial instability issue at all, although it will create some volatility. Sharp says There are clearly issues around the Brexit situation. We have seen them manifest themselves in the foreign exchange market, but I don\u2019t consider them to be fundamental financial stability issues for this nation. That is likely to please the eurosceptic side of the argument, who have claimed that the government is running a Project Fear campaign. Over in parliament, Bank of England policymaker Dame Clara Furse has agreed that the possibility of Britain leaving the EU is a threat to UK financial stability. She told the Treasury committee that: It is clearly true that any significant uncertainty is likely to create disruption, and that disruption creates risks. It also creates opportunities, but it creates risk. And in the short term, that seems to be the case. Dame Clara was being quizzed by the Treasury committee ahead of her re-appointment to the Bank\u2019s Financial Policy Committee, which is charged with ensuring financial stability. However, committee chair Andrew Tyrie isn\u2019t too impressed that Brexit didn\u2019t actually appear on the list of risks gave to the committee in her written evidence. Why wasn\u2019t it there? It\u2019s all a little awkward, with Dame Clare eventually admitting that: \u201cI shall think more carefully next time I put in a written submission\u201d. She also denies being influenced by yesterday\u2019s session, where BoE governor Mark Carney said Brexit was the biggest single domestic threat to the recovery. You can watch the session live, here. Over in France, transport unions and youth groups have been holding demonstrations and a strike against the government\u2019s labour reforms. Crowds took to the streets in scores of cities to protest against proposals to amend France\u2019s 35-hour working week. There was a big turnout in Marseille: In Paris, several schools were blocked off by students who set up barricades with garbage cans. Associated Press has more details: Outside the Helene Boucher high school, students cheered any mention of how the movement would prevent Hollande and the government from passing the bill. Maryanne Gicquel, a spokesperson for the FIDL student union, described young people\u2019s journey towards a stable job as \u201ca succession of internships and poorly paid jobs\u201d. \u201cNow we\u2019re being told that it will be easier for companies to lay off workers,\u201d she said. The Wall Street Journal has a good take on the Burberry takeover bid that wasn\u2019t. Saabira Chaudhuri writes: Who is the mystery Burberry Group investor? There isn\u2019t one. The takeover speculation that drove the British luxury retailer\u2019s shares 6.6% higher on Tuesday turned out to be mistaken, according to a person familiar with the matter, sending the stock tumbling in Wednesday trading. The shares had soared after a Financial Times article reported on a routine shareholder filing made in February, showing that HSBC Holdings PLC had accrued a stake of more than 5% in Burberry on behalf of what appeared to be an undisclosed investor. That fueled speculation about a possible takeover bid or activist investment. Burberry asked HSBC for the investor\u2019s identity and was waiting on the bank\u2019s response. On Wednesday, the person familiar with the matter said Burberry had learned that the stake had been accumulated by several HSBC entities on behalf of multiple, separate investors, triggering the 5% threshold. More here: Shares in Burberry have slumped by over 5%, as the takeover talk that gripped the City yesterday deflates. That wipes out all yesterday\u2019s rally: Rumours that fashion house Burberry might be facing a takeover battle appear to be unfounded. Burberry has been scrambling to protect itself against a mysterious predator, after it emerged that HSBC was holding a 5% stake in the company. This looked like a takeover bid could be looming. But now, HSBC has revealed that this stake is actually made up of several smaller bundles of shares it\u2019s holding for a few different clients. The FT has more details: One person close to Burberry said the company was informed on Tuesday that the unusual surge in HSBC holdings was \u201cbusiness as usual trading\u201d and described the nature of the investors as \u201cinstitutional\u201d. Another person said it was \u201cmultiple\u201d investors. Burberry and HSBC declined to comment. More well-heeled readers can cancel their private jet orders, because Michael O\u2019Leary has got them covered. His budget airline, Ryanair, has today announced plans for a new corporate jet operation, as my colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The budget airline will offer fine dining on a Boeing 737-700 jet refitted to seat 60 passengers on reclining business class seats. A spokesman said the plane can be hired by the hour, with the \u201ccompetitive\u201d rate depending on the arrival and departure airports. Ryanair said the jet would be \u201cideal for private corporate, sports team or group travel\u201d. Asked if Ryanair would accept booking from stag and hen dos, a spokesperson said the carrier was \u201chappy to provide quotes for any groups\u201d. After all, nothing says luxury like a bunch of lads necking J\u00e4gerbombs at 20,000 feet (I imagine). More here: The Economist Intelligence Unit is gloomier about China today, following dire-looking trade date earlier this week: Wall Street shares are expected to rise when trading begins, at 2.3opm GMT/8.30am East Coast time. After a subdued start, European stock markets are now positive, partly thanks to the rise in UK manufacturing output. Here\u2019s the situation: FTSE 100: up 35 points at 6160, +0.6% German DAX: up 112 points at 9805, + 1.1% French CAC: up 45 points at 4449, + 1% Investors are also anticipating fresh stimulus measures from the European Central bank tomorrow, as Spreadex\u2019s Connor Campbell explains: It is interesting that the French index kept in-step with its German counterpart, since the Banque de France cut its growth forecasts to 0.3% for the quarter this morning following a factory sentiment slump. Arguably, however, that news merely puts more pressure on Mario Draghi ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting, investors hoping for a multi-faceted approach to stimulus (and not a damp squib like last December) from the region\u2019s central bank. The oil price is pushing up this morning, following reports that crude producers are planning a meeting. Brent crude has gained 1.7% to $40.34, after an Iraqi oil official told state newspaper Al-Sabah that OPEC and non-OPEC members are going to gather in Moscow. They could potentially discuss freezing output. Mike Ashley, the boss of Sports Direct, has been ordered to testify to the House of Commons over the company\u2019s treatment of its staff. The Business, Innovation and Skills Committee has warned Ashley that, unless he appears, he would be found in contempt of parliament. That could, in theory, mean he\u2019d be jailed*. BIS decided in December to question Ashley, following the Guardian\u2019s exposure of working practices at Sport Direct. Ashley hasn\u2019t accepted any of the dates offered by the committee..... and now Iain Wright, chair of the committee, has told him to find a window in his diary within two weeks, or else.... Here\u2019s the full letter (which is online here) I am writing on behalf of the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee to establish whether you will accept the Committee\u2019s invitation to give evidence to it at Westminster. The Committee would like to hear about the action that you have taken in response to reports in the media about the treatment ofworkers at Sports Direct and about the scope, progress and timetable of your own review of working practices that you announced in December. The treatment of low paid workers and enforcement of the national minimum wage are issues that the Committee will be keeping under review over the coming months. The Committee noted your invitation to attend a meeting at the company\u2019s premises at Shirebrook. In line with select committees\u2019 commitment to transparency, it is normal practice for the BIS Committee to meet in public at Westminster and we agreed to adhere to this practice on this occasion. A number of alternative dates have been offered to you by the Committee Clerk, but as yet you have not accepted any of them, nor agreed in principle to attend. As you will be aware, select committees do not normally need to have recourse to our formal powers to summon witnesses in order to secure attendance; refusal to attend without good reason may be considered a contempt of the House. Should you fail in your reply to agree to attend on one of the dates offered to you, or a mutually convenient alternative before 1 June, the Committee reserves the right to take the matter further, including seeking the support of the House of Commons in respect of any complaint of contempt. In the interests of transparency, I may make this letter publicly available, and also your subsequent reply, which I would ask that we receive by 21 March. * Update: The consequences of being in contempt of parliament are not completely clear. Back in 1880, one Charles Grissell was locked up in the House of Commons\u2019 belltower for the offence. But no-one has fallen foul of the law for decades, so the powers are effectively untested in recent times. But the government\u2019s recent \u201cgreen paper on parliamentary privilege, published in 2012, said: [Parliament\u2019s] power to punish non-members for contempt is untested in recent times. In theory, both houses can summon a person to the bar of the house to reprimand them or order a person\u2019s imprisonment. Unions have warned that British workers are getting a raw deal, after the number of people on zero-hours contracts jumped again. New government figures show that 801,000 people were on contracts that don\u2019t guarantee a minimum number of hours work each week. That\u2019s up from 697,000 six months earlier. Around one in three people on a zero-hours contract wanted to work more hours, with most wanting them in their current job, the ONS added. Britain\u2019s unemployment rate is currently just 5.1%, which ought to put workers in a strong position. Instead, employers still seem to be calling the shots. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says workers without guaranteed hours need more support: \u201cZero-hours contracts may be a dream for cost-cutting employers, but they can be a nightmare for workers. Many people on zero-hours contracts are unable to plan for their future and regularly struggle with paying bills and having a decent family life. The so-called flexibility these contracts offer is far too one-sided. Staff without guaranteed pay have much less power to stand up for their rights and often feel afraid to turn down shifts in case they fall out of favour with their boss. The European Union is proposing better rights for zero-hours workers - another reason why workers should be worried about the risks of Brexit.\u201d British manufacturers did extremely well to boost output by 0.7% in January, given the global turmoil. So says Mark Stephenson, UK manufacturing industry leader at Deloitte: \u201cThe challenges UK manufacturers are up against should not be underestimated. Slow global economic growth, weak Chinese trade data, downgraded UK growth forecasts, turmoil in the steel industry and the PMI at its lowest point for almost three years, are just some of the factors at play. \u201cTherefore today\u2019s manufacturing output figures show how resilient the industry is and signals the prospect of a more positive year ahead for UK manufacturers. This week\u2019s EEF survey highlighted that firms expect modest growth in the coming months, and a weakened pound should boost many exporters.\u201d This rather retailed chart confirms UK manufacturing picked up in January, while the mining and energy sector was notably weak: Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector has burst back to growth. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7% month-on-month in January, according to the new report from the Office for National Statistics. That follows three months of falling output and also beats City forecasts, with economists expecting an increase of just 0.2%. Firms making plastic, metal and rubber products all reported that output rose during the month, and there was also a big rise in the \u2018manufacturing and repair\u2019 section of the report. It looks like a decent sign, says Alex Lydall, senior sales trader at Foenix Partners: Given fresh concerns over what a potential Brexit could do for large UK corporate companies, the strong recovery seen this morning for January\u2019s Manufacturing Sector - recording 0.5% above analyst forecasts - will be a huge relief and welcome news for Bank of England governor Mark Carney. But it\u2019s not all good news. Manufacturing output is still 0.1% smaller than a year ago. And wider measure of industrial production only rose by 0.3%, and was dragged down by a fall in mining, crude oil and gas production. The gloom swirling over France has darkened this morning. The country\u2019s central bank has cut its growth forecast for the current quarter, after finding a big fall in confidence among factory bosses. Bloomberg has the story: Sentiment among factory executives dropped to 98 in February from 101 in January, its biggest decline since January 2013, according to a monthly survey from the central bank. As a result, the economy will expand 0.3% this quarter instead of 0.4%, the Bank of France said on Wednesday. The drop in confidence is a significant indication that a slowdown in emerging-market economies such as China and Brazil is spilling over into Europe and may threaten France\u2019s first real recovery since President Francois Hollande came to power in May 2012. The political storm swirling over Bank of England governor Mark Carney has intensified this morning, with one MP suggesting he should consider resigning. Carney has irked the government\u2019s eurosceptic wing (not a difficult task, to be fair) by warning yesterday that Britain\u2019s economy could suffer if it left the EU. He suggested some banks could move jobs overseas, while consumer spending and house prices could be hit. The governor insisted that the Bank wasn\u2019t making any recommendation about Brexit, but that hasn\u2019t convinced Sir Peter Bone. Bone told Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme that Carney\u2019s performance was \u201cextraordinary\u201d, adding: \u201cHe was speculating, and speculating in a way that I say is wholly unbelievable. It seemed to be part of the Project Fear. I guess it was orchestrated by conversations either with the Chancellor or the Prime Minister. \u201cIf the governor had speculated that way that we should come out of the EU, do you think Downing Street wouldn\u2019t be clamouring for his head at the moment?\u201d Bone is one of parliament\u2019s more colourful backbenchers, famous for often telling the House of Commons what (the long-suffering) Mrs Bone thinks about the affairs of the nation. So Carney may not be packing his bags quite yet..... Insurance firm Prudential has just cheered the City by announcing a 22% jump in operating profits. Investors are going to be quids in -- the Pru is raising its dividend by 5%, and paying a special divi of 10p as well. The company is also arguing that we\u2019re too pessimistic about the Asian emerging markets, where it is a big player. European stock markets have made a mixed start to trading, after seeing Asia hit a one-week low overnight. Mining shares are mostly down in the City, reflecting concerns over China. And the Restaurant Group\u2019s downbeat results statement has also hit sentiment. Despite the recent market turbulence, Britain\u2019s premier luxury chocolate maker has decided to float on the London exchange. Hotel Chocolat is hoping to raise \u00a350m by entering the AIM Market. The company already runs 84 shops, a tasting club with 70,000 members, and its own cocoa plantation on St Lucia. It now plans to expand its British chocolate manufacturing, and invest in in new stores and its digital operations. Here\u2019s the announcement. Kit Juckes, top foreign exchange strategist at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, has an interesting take on the state of the markets. He told clients this morning: I can\u2019t help reflecting that we\u2019re still living with the consequences of the twin bubbles - credit and commodities - that were unleashed by the Fed\u2019s absurdly easy monetary policy in 2003. The credit bubble burst in 2008 and prompted even easier policy, as well as QE. That drove bond yields down and gave the commodity bubble a fresh lease of life, but when that too burst, we got commodity price deflation to go with the low yields and the result is they are even lower. Investors are left hunting for yield by buying emerging market or high-yield bonds as soon as there is any semblance of calm, but it\u2019s no surprise that the over-riding mood is so fragile. And while all this is going on, China\u2019s economic re-balancing is still progressing at a glacial pace, Europe\u2019s recovery is hamstrung by a broken financial transmission mechanism and an inability to ease fiscal policy, and the US is stuck in post-GFC second gear, with 2% growth in wages, employment and GDP but not prospect of an acceleration that would provide comfort for emerging market economies. All of this leaves markets subject to mood swings such as we\u2019re seeing. There\u2019s thin gruel for investors in the Restaurant Group today. Shares in the company have tumbled 15% at the start of trading, after it warned the City this morning that like-for-like sales are down by 1.5% so far this year. And it also cautioned that trading will remain tricks at its outlets, which includes the Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s and Chiquito chains, plus eateries at various airports. The more challenging trading conditions we saw at the end of last year have continued into the early part of 2016, reflecting a softening in consumer demand and weaker overall consumer confidence. Whilst still early in the year, our assessment is that this more challenging environment and recent trading patterns are likely to persist. Germany\u2019s push into renewable energy has driven its utility giant E.ON into a record loss. E.ON reported a net loss of \u20ac7bn for 2015, after writing billions off the value of its power plants. It also warned that 2016 will be tough too, due to the \u201cstructural transformations\u201d in Germany\u2019s energy industry. The FT\u2019s Nathalie Thomas explains: Germany is aiming to generate 80 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources, such as wind and solar, by 2050, up from around a quarter today. But government subsidies for renewables have led to an increase in power generation which has caused wholesale prices to tumble, eroding profitability at the utility companies\u2019 coal and gas-fired power stations. Worries over the Chinese economy have weighed on Asian stock markets overnight. Yesterday\u2019s alarmingly weak trade data, which showed a 25% tumble in China\u2019s exports in February, hit many shares on the Shanghai stock market. Reuters has the details: China stocks dropped more than 1% on Wednesday, snapping a six-session winning streak, as a tumble in commodity prices hit resource shares and prompted profit-taking amid signs of persistent lethargy in the economy. The blue-chip CSI300 index declined 1.2%, to 3,071.91, while the Shanghai Composite Index shed 1.3%, to 2,862.56 points, registering their first losses in seven sessions. All sectors, with the exception of banks, lost ground as China\u2019s much worse-than-expected February trade data revived concerns about the country\u2019s economic health. An index tracking resource businesses tumbled 5.3 percent, while the energy sector slumped 3.6 percent. Investors dumped index heavyweights such as Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel Co and Sinopec on lower raw material and oil prices. Japan\u2019s Nikkei also fell by almost 1%, while Hong Kong is also in the red in late trading. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a fragile feel in the air in the City today - along with a LOT of rain - after Tuesday\u2019s barrage of gloomy news. The 25% slump in Chinese exports, allied to another warning from the IMF about economic risks, have punctured the optimism that had been building in the last couple of weeks. Wall Street\u2019s Citigroup has created extra anxiety, by warning last night that revenues this quarter will be sharply below forecasts. And with the oil price falling back below $40 last night, we can all expect more volatility as 2016 shapes up to be an edgy and uncertain year. We get a new healthcheck on the UK manufacturing sector this morning, when the latest industrial production data is released at 9.30am. Economists are hoping for a decent report, as CMC\u2019s Michael Hewson explains: The manufacturing sector has borne the brunt of the global economic slowdown over the past few months and once again the UK economy is in the cross hairs today with the latest ONS manufacturing and industrial production data for January. December was an extremely disappointing month with sharp declines in both as 2015 came to a disappointing end. The expectation is for a rebound in January with a 0.4% rise in industrial production, and a 0.2% rise in manufacturing production This would be in line with a similar improvement seen in the January PMI numbers, but could well prove only temporary given the sharp drop seen in the February PMI data. Otherwise, there\u2019s not too much afoot, although tensions are building ahead of Thursday\u2019s European Central Bank meeting. Here\u2019s today\u2019s agenda: 9.30am: UK industrial and manufacturing report for January 3pm: Canadian central bank interest rate decision 3pm: NIESR publishes its latest estimate of UK growth in the last three months And on the corporate front, we\u2019re getting results from Germany utility firm E.ON, security firm G4S and eating out chain the Restaurant Group.",

The German power group announced a \u20ac7bn (\u00a35.4bn) net loss for 2015 just 24 hours after another big six supplier, npower, reported UK losses of \u20ac130m and unveiled plans to cut 2,400 jobs in Britain. The losses come ahead of a Competition and Markets Authority report tomorrow, which will announce new measures aimed to crack down on overcharging in the energy supply sector. E.ON blamed a collapse in commodity values and a slump in European wholesale electricity prices for last year\u2019s losses, which are double those reported 12 months earlier. Both E.ON and npower\u2019s parent group, RWE, have also blamed some of their problems on the German government policy of closing down nuclear plants after the Fukushima accident, as well as pushing renewable power in favour of fossil fuels. E.ON\u2019s UK subsidiary reported flat profits despite a 9% fall in earnings to \u00a3267m from its supply business. E.ON has been gradually shutting down some of its UK coal or gas-fired power plants but opening wind farms as well as continuing to supply 5 million gas and electricity customers. All big six UK energy suppliers have been fighting to retain customers as they come under threat from a new breed of small independents such as Ecotricity and First Utility. E.ON has recently run into trouble over an agreement it made with Age UK to provide power to the charity\u2019s members. The deal has been suspended after accusations that the tariff was more expensive rather than others on offer. In Germany, E.ON is in the middle of its own company restructuring which will see the traditional generating capacity hived off into a separate company called Uniper to be listed on the German stock market later this year. E.ON will in future concentrate on renewable energy, but the group said the internal shakeup and Germany\u2019s move to a low-carbon power system would pose difficulties. Johannes Teyssen, the group chief executive, argued the turbulence would be \u201ctougher and longer than anticipated\u201d.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Prudential\u2019s new boss, Mike Wells, said the UK should remain in the European Union, but noted that the impact of a vote to leave on the insurer\u2019s business would be \u201cmanageable\u201d. His comments came as the company beat City forecasts with a 22% rise in profits to \u00a34bn for 2015 and said it would pay a special dividend. Wells was among almost 200 business leaders who signed an open letter calling for Britain to stay in the EU, published in the Times last month. The signatories included executives at BP, BT, Vodafone, Asda, HSBC and Marks &amp; Spencer. Wells, Prudential\u2019s former US chief who took over from Tidjane Thiam as group chief executive in June, said: \u201cIt\u2019s in our interest for the UK to remain.\u201d But he noted that the company generates 87% of its business outside the EU, and said the impact of a Brexit vote in the June referendum would be \u201cmanageable\u201d. The group\u2019s investment arm, M&amp;G, would be most affected should Britain leave the EU. \u201cThe infrastructure for its distribution is set up in Europe, and an exit from the EU could affect that materially,\u201d Wells said. M&amp;G suffered fund outflows of 7% to \u00a3246bn last year, as retail investors pulled nearly \u00a311bn of funds during volatile markets. Its Optimal Income fund, run by Richard Woolnough, was hit by withdrawals of \u00a39bn, leaving it with \u00a315bn in funds. Woolnough is one of the highest paid fund managers in the City and scooped \u00a317.5m last year after a bumper year for his bond funds. Prudential\u2019s Asian business made operating profits before tax of \u00a31.3bn, up 17% at constant exchange rates, while the US put in \u00a31.7bn, up 10%, and the UK contributed nearly \u00a31.2bn, up 60%, boosted by a one-off item of \u00a3339m. Hong Kong was particularly strong with sales surging 74%, as the firm hired more agents and demand from mainland Chinese customers, who account for half of its new business in Hong Kong, picked up. However, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia slowed. The company now has 560,000 agents across Asia, mostly women. Wells brushed off concerns about China\u2019s economic slowdown, arguing that the country\u2019s growing middle classes still wanted to invest in savings products, and foreign insurers only had a small slice of the Chinese market \u2013 less than 10% \u2013 with Prudential controlling 5.5% through a joint-venture. Prudential raised its 2015 dividend by 5% to 38.78p a share and will also pay a special dividend of 10p a share. Its share price rose nearly 3% to \u00a313.65, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index.",

The signatories included executives at BP, BT, Vodafone, Asda, HSBC and Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>Wells, Prudential\u2019s former US chief who took over from Tidjane Thiam as group chief executive in June, said: \u201cIt\u2019s in our interest for the UK to remain.\u201d But he noted that the company generates 87% of its business outside the EU, and said the impact of a Brexit vote in the June referendum would be \u201cmanageable\u201d.<br></p> <p>The group\u2019s investment arm, M&amp;G, would be most affected should Britain leave the EU. \u201cThe infrastructure for its distribution is set up in Europe, and an exit from the EU could affect that materially,\u201d Wells said.</p> <p>M&amp;G suffered fund outflows of 7% to \u00a3246bn last year, as retail investors pulled nearly \u00a311bn of funds during volatile markets. Its Optimal Income fund, run by Richard Woolnough, was hit by withdrawals of \u00a39bn, leaving it with \u00a315bn in funds. <a href=\"http://%20http//www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/01/m-and-g-richard-woolnough-city-top-earners-poor-performance-finance-prudential\">Woolnough is one of the highest paid fund managers in the City</a> and scooped \u00a317.5m last year after a bumper year for his bond funds.</p> <p>Prudential\u2019s Asian business made operating profits before tax of \u00a31.3bn, up 17% at constant exchange rates, while the US put in \u00a31.7bn, up 10%, and the UK contributed nearly \u00a31.2bn, up 60%, boosted by a one-off item of \u00a3339m.</p> <p>Hong Kong was particularly strong with sales surging 74%, as the firm hired more agents and demand from mainland Chinese customers, who account for half of its new business in Hong Kong, picked up. However, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia slowed. The company now has 560,000 agents across Asia, mostly women.</p> <p>Wells brushed off concerns about China\u2019s economic slowdown, arguing that the country\u2019s growing middle classes still wanted to invest in savings products, and foreign insurers only had a small slice of the Chinese market \u2013 less than 10% \u2013 with Prudential controlling 5.5% through a joint-venture. </p> <p>Prudential raised its 2015 dividend by 5% to 38.78p a share and will also pay a special dividend of 10p a share.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair has taken its move upmarket to a whole new level by launching a corporate jet service. The budget airline will offer fine dining on a Boeing 737-700 jet refitted to carry 60 passengers on reclining leather business class seats. A spokesman said the plane can be hired by the hour, with the \u201ccompetitive\u201d rate depending on the cost of using the arrival and departure airports. The average Ryanair fare is \u20ac47 one-way, whereas a 60 seater private jet from London to Geneva charges about \u00a333,000 \u2013 or \u00a3550 a head \u2013 for a return day trip. Ryanair said the jet would be \u201cideal for private corporate, sports team or group travel\u201d. Asked if Ryanair would accept bookings from stag and hen parties, a spokesperson said the carrier was \u201chappy to provide quotes for any groups\u201d. The service can operate flights of up to six hours duration, which puts it within reach of north Africa, Turkey and Israel. A Ryanair spokesman said: \u201cMore than 25 million business travellers fly with Ryanair every year ... Now, business and group travellers can also enjoy the benefits of Ryanair\u2019s corporate jet service, as we offer a customised Ryanair Boeing 737-700 for private charter.\u201d The cost for prospective hen or stag dos runs into hundreds of pounds per head. PrivateFly, a charter service, recently flew a hen party to Paris on an eight-seater King Air plane for a day trip that cost \u00a3350 a head. Carol Cork, sales and marketing director at PrivateFly, said Ryanair would be able to undercut other private jet operators because it has stronger buying power on fuel and airport landing fees. But, she added that Ryanair faced a bigger problem in handling the service at airports and providing good catering. She said Ryanair had got the timing right, with the European football championship taking place this summer. \u201cThis is where you would see much more demand,\u201d she said. She added that Ryanair could decide to configure its aircraft to tap into the VVIP market \u2013 by adding millionaire-friendly touches such as fish tanks and grand pianos. The move is Ryanair\u2019s latest attempt to revamp its image and move more upmarket. The Irish carrier was slower than its rival easyJet in launching a business service. It introduced \u201cbusiness plus\u201d fares in mid-2014 which offer flexible tickets, more check-in baggage, priority boarding and \u201cpremium\u201d seats for quick boarding or passengers seeking extra legroom. Ryanair has also introduced reserved seating and relaxed cabin bag restrictions for all passengers, after its chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, realised that being \u201cnice\u201d to customers would pay off. PrivateFly\u2019s Cork noted that Ryanair\u2019s fleet was newer than some of the other converted Boeing 737s used in the market. She estimated the cost per flying hour at \u00a38,000 to \u00a39,000, plus landing and handling fees, while smaller private jets cost from \u00a31,500 an hour to charter. Private jet charter firm Hunt &amp; Palmer charges \u00a356,000 for a three-day trip from London to Rome, Berlin and Paris on a 45-seater Boeing 737. London to Malaga, with a one night stop, costs \u00a349,000. David Doughty, sales director at Private Jet Charter, said the pricing would depend on the aircraft, because some private jets have showers and bedrooms. One of the more memorable trips he recalled was flying a dog to Jersey from Bournemouth as a Christmas present for a customer\u2019s young son. \u201cHis dog had died and his best friend had died from leukaemia, so his mother tried to cheer him up.\u201d That trip cost \u00a38,500.",

      "bodyText": "The UK company behind Trunki ride-on suitcases for children has lost its battle in the supreme court in London, which dismissed its appeal over the design of Hong Kong rival Kiddee. Lawyers and intellectual property experts said the ruling was a blow to small creative businesses in Britain that rely on design rights, and meant that designers would need to take great care when applying for protection for designs in future. Jeremy Drew, head of retail at law firm RPC, said it would \u201csend shockwaves through design-driven businesses\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is highly likely that other businesses may now begin to see cheaper versions of their well-known original registered designs coming on to the market.\u201d In a long-running legal saga, Magmatic, the Bristol-based company behind Trunki, argued that Kiddee suitcases infringe its registered design rights. They are made by the Hong Kong-based PMS International and, like Trunki cases, are decorated to look like animals. Five supreme court justices unanimously ruled in favour of PMS on Wednesday. The case centred on the issue of whether surface decoration ought to be considered when deciding if design rights have been infringed. Magmatic\u2019s chief executive and founder, Rob Law, said the company was \u201cdevastated and bewildered\u201d by this judgment. \u201cWe created an original product in Trunki and protected it by computer-generated registered design \u2013 a process used to protect a third of designs across Europe. In my honest opinion, the Trunki was wilfully ripped off.\u201d The legal battle has lasted several years and cost the firm more than \u00a3500,000. Lord Neuberger, the court\u2019s president, expressed \u201csome regret\u201d as the conception of the Trunki \u201cseems to have been both original and clever\u201d. The judgment then said: \u201cIt appears clear that Mr Beverley of PMS conceived the idea of manufacturing a Kiddee Case as a result of seeing a Trunki, and discovering that a discount model was not available. Unfortunately for Magmatic, however, this appeal is not concerned with an idea or an invention, but with a design.\u201d Paul Beverley, the managing director of PMS, has openly admitted that he came up with the idea for Kiddee Cases after seeing Trunki luggage. He hailed the court decision as a \u201cvictory for fair competition\u201d. He said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision in PMS\u2019s favour ensures that the Kiddee Case can continue to be sold to price-conscious UK families.\u201d Tania Clark, partner and trademark attorney at European intellectual property (IP) firm Withers &amp; Rogers, said: \u201cWhat Magmatic was effectively trying to achieve in this case, on the basis of a single registered design, was the exclusion of a competitor\u2019s design from the market. Given the differences in the designs, however, this was not enough.\u201d Clare Jackman, an IP lawyer at global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, said it was likely that designers would file a number of applications to protect products in future, rather than relying on just one. Arty Rajendra, partner at law firm Rouse Legal, described the court ruling as an \u201cundoubted blow for UK design and creative industries\u201d. \u201cThe courts have to strike the right balance between incentivising innovation, while simultaneously promoting fair competition. Today\u2019s ruling cements the growing perception that the pendulum swings too far in favour of the alleged infringer.\u201d",

Ashley has seen almost \u00a31bn wiped from his personal fortune after a downturn in trading at the store chain and a Guardian investigation which revealed that thousands of the retailer\u2019s temporary warehouse workers were receiving effective hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. In a strongly worded letter to the billionaire, Iain Wright MP, the chairman of the business, innovation and skills (BIS) committee, said: \u201cA number of alternative dates have been offered to you by the committee clerk, but as yet you have not accepted any of them, nor agreed in principle to attend. As you will be aware, select committees do not normally need to have recourse to our formal powers to summon witnesses in order to secure attendance; refusal to attend without good reason may be considered a contempt of the house. \u201cShould you fail in your reply to agree to attend on one of the dates offered to you, or a mutually convenient alternative before 1 June, the committee reserves the right to take the matter further, including seeking the support of the House of Commons in respect of any complaint of contempt.\u201d Wright has given Ashley, who owns 55% of Sports Direct, until 21 March to reply. The standoff is the second time Ashley has resisted attempts to have him give evidence to MPs. He declined an invitation to appear in front of the Scottish affairs select committee last year, explaining that he was busy on the dates suggested. Instead, the company sent its chairman, Keith Hellawell, who repeatedly struggled to answer detailed questions. Ashley has offered to meet the BIS committee privately at Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, but Wright has declined \u201cin line with select committees\u2019 commitment to transparency\u201d. A spokesman for Sports Direct said: \u201cMike Ashley has previously invited members of the committee to attend Shirebrook in order to see for themselves the company\u2019s working practices. That invitation remains open. Mike will respond to the committee\u2019s recent letter in due course.\u201d Last year, undercover Guardian reporters employed inside the retailer\u2019s warehouse found that thousands of workers were subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance, while local primary schoolteachers also told the newspaper that pupils could remain in school while ill \u2013 and return home to empty houses \u2013 as parents working at the depot were too frightened to take time off work. The reports added to the pressure on the firm, which had already been accused of operating \u201cDickensian practices\u201d by the union Unite. Ashley responded to the Guardian\u2019s reports by announcing a pay rise for staff, as well as a review of all agency staff terms and conditions, which he would oversee personally. However, the moves \u2013 coupled with disappointing trading by the retailer \u2013 failed to relieve any pressure from the group\u2019s shares and the company was relegated from the FTSE 100 last week. Outside retailing, Ashley has also suffered a number of reverses. Newcastle United, the football club he owns, is reportedly scrambling to find a new manager as the team struggles against relegation from the Premier League. Meanwhile, the tycoon has been hit by a series of problems in his high court battles with Scottish championship club Rangers, of which he owns about 9%, including being chastised by a high court judge for abusing the legal system to \u201cintimidate\u201d the club\u2019s chairman, Dave King. Theoretically, contempt of the House of Commons can be punishable by imprisonment, although the powers are so archaic they may no longer be practically enforceable. The government\u2019s green paper on parliamentary privilege, published in 2012, said: \u201c[Parliament\u2019s] power to punish non-members for contempt is untested in recent times. In theory, both houses can summon a person to the bar of the house to reprimand them or order a person\u2019s imprisonment. In addition, the House of Lords is regarded as possessing the power to fine non-members. The House of Commons last used its power to fine in 1666 and this power may since have lapsed.\u201d If Ashley continues to refuse to give evidence, the most likely procedure is for the select committee to seek the support of the Commons for \u201can order to attend\u201d, effectively a summons. If that fails, the matter could either be referred to the committee of privileges to rule upon contempt, or, if the offence is blatant, parliament itself could take action through a motion deploring the witness\u2019s conduct, all of which could inflict further damage on the reputations of Ashley and his company.",

Founders Angus Thirlwell and Peter Harris, who each own half of the business, plan a \u00a350m placing on the London Stock Exchange\u2019s Aim by the end of June, which will raise \u00a310m and hand them \u00a320m each in cash. Hotel Chocolat, which started in 1993, has more than 80 stores in the UK and three in Copenhagen, and also sells its luxury chocolates online. The brand has a cocoa plantation on St Lucia, which is home to a luxury hotel where a two-week stay costs up to \u00a310,000. The plantation is currently a separate company under the same ownership, but it will be acquired by the main group prior to the listing. Hotel Chocolat has sales of \u00a381.1m and makes an underlying pre-tax profit of \u00a37.9m. Previously, Hotel Chocolat has steered clear of raising money through the traditional channels. It issued \u201cchocolate bonds\u201d to customers and private retail investors when it needed to raise capital to expand in 2010. Interest was paid in chocolate, rather than cash. A second issue of chocolate bonds followed and the company was able to raise about \u00a37m in development capital from the two schemes. Thirlwell, Hotel Chocolat\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cHotel Chocolat is built on our core values of authenticity, originality and ethical trading. We are very excited at the prospect of listing as it is the next logical step in our growth plans and will enable us to accelerate the many initiatives that we have in place, in particular additional investment in our British chocolate manufacturing, in new stores and in our digital offering.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A dramatic spike in the price of iron ore this week has been blamed on an upcoming flower show that is designed to showcase green-living in one of China\u2019s most smog-choked industrial cities. Steel mills in Tangshan \u2013 a city of about 7 million inhabitants in China\u2019s steel-producing heartlands \u2013 reportedly sent prices rocketing by nearly 20% on Monday, after going on an unexpected shopping spree for the commodity ahead of an enforced shutdown later this year. The partial shutdown is intended to reduce smog during the 2016 World Horticultural Exposition, which the city will host from April until October . Speaking at China\u2019s annual rubber-stamp parliament on Tuesday, Jiao Yanlong, Tangshan\u2019s Communist party secretary, told the Financial Times (\u00a3) that temporary air quality control measures would see production at the city\u2019s steel mills cut in half until the end of September. In an interview with the state-run China News Service the Communist party chief of Tangshan, which produced more steel in 2014 than the US, said the flower show highlighted his city\u2019s determination to pioneer the \u201cgreen development of this resource-based city\u201d. Tangshan\u2019s horticultural expo is an attempt to remake the image of a city that outsiders associate with two disasters: one natural, one man-made. A catastrophic earthquake in 1976 \u2013 the year Chairman Mao died \u2013 is thought to have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and levelled most of the city. After rebuilding, Tangshan, which is about 200km south-east of Beijing, became a heavy industry powerhouse, creating great wealth for some but also a severe and deadly pollution crisis that sees the city regularly cloaked in toxic smog. Now Tangshan\u2019s rulers are billing the horticultural event \u2013 which has the theme \u201cCity and Nature, Phoenix Nirvana!\u201d \u2013 as a chance to show the world another side of their much maligned city. A promotional video boasts that the expo will highlight the \u201charmonious coexistence between human and nature\u201d. Visitors will witness Tangshan\u2019s attempts to transform itself into \u201ca new model of the times\u201d as well as \u201ca comprehensive beautiful coastal city with prosperity and harmony\u201d. Organisers say the exhibition will feature a series of international-themed floral exhibits including British Garden: Maze of the Rose, French Garden: Exquisite Life and German Garden: Dream of romance. For all the florid rhetoric Tangshan is currently at the sharp end of a major crisis that is gripping the Chinese steel industry as Beijing grapples with the problem of massive over-capacity in the sector. Some once bustling corners of the city are now eerily deserted with mills forced to close down as a result of over-capacity and plummeting demand. \u201cDomestically, problems and risks that have been building up over the years are becoming more evident,\u201d Chinese premier Li Keqiang admitted last weekend at the start of the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing. \u201cBut we will not be daunted by these problems and challenges.\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao",

      "bodyText": "Conservative rebels have said they are willing to enter an \u201cunholy alliance\u201d with the SNP and Labour in an effort to defeat government plans to liberalise Sunday trading laws. The decision leaves Downing Street facing a knife-edge vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday. Whitehall sources accused the SNP of hypocrisy for intervening in the vote, because it only relates to England and Wales and the reforms already exist in Scotland. The reforms represent the biggest shakeup in Sunday trading laws for 20 years, ending a rule that restricts large stores to open for just six hours between 10pm and 6pm. Small shops have been able to open for longer since 1994. The Tory rebellion is being led by David Burrowes, who said he wanted a \u201cmore sensible, palatable way forward\u201d that might restrict the changes just to seaside towns and city centres. \u201cIt is a fairly unholy alliance but it is not so much about what the SNP thinks but how the government will deal with the large concerns across party.\u201d He suggested that the SNP was justified in its decision because the plans could trigger a \u201cdomino effect\u201d that could affect Scottish workers. The SNP fears that the change could reduce the \u201cpremium\u201d wages earned by Scottish people who work on Sundays. The decision by the party\u2019s deputy leader, Stewart Hosie, that he would not support the reforms outlined by George Osborne in his budget in July, was a change of tack after the weekly meeting of his party\u2019s MPs. The party\u2019s 54 MPs will vote with the Tory rebels, who are seeking to defeat government plans to give councils the right to zone areas that would be free from restricted trading hours. Hosie said: \u201cWe will support the Burrowes amendment.\u201d UK government sources indicated that the decision by the SNP guarantees that the vote on the final Commons stages of the enterprise bill on Wednesday afternoon will be tight. Burrowes has won the support of 24 Tory MPs. If he can increase that number to about 36, he should be able to defeat the government with the help of Labour and the SNP. The government has a parliamentary majority of 17. One option would be for the government to seek to reduce the number of Tory rebels by accepting an amendment by the former Tory environment secretary Caroline Spelman to allow cities with large numbers of tourists to opt out of the current Sunday trading laws. A UK government source said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing and hypocritical of the SNP to be trying to deny people the freedoms to shop that are already available to those they represent in Scotland. \u201cIt\u2019s a particularly extraordinary position for a party that supposedly believes in devolution of powers from Whitehall to be seeking to stand in the way of local leaders in the rest of the UK being able to choose what\u2019s right for their communities and their economies.\u201d Whitehall sources expressed irritation with the SNP, which reportedly indicated to the UK government in recent weeks that it would not stand in the way of the reforms. The Conservative MP Grant Shapps called the SNP\u2019s decision to oppose the vote as the \u201cmost bizarre position I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday, the former Tory chair argued that the bill provided extra protections for workers, pointing to a reduction in the amount of notice workers have to give to opt out of Sunday working. But he conceded that there was no specific policy to offer employees a Sunday pay premium, as demanded by the SNP. Instead he argued that could be the natural result of the policy as, \u201cbusinesses who want to employ people on Sunday may find they have to pay a premium on a Sunday\u201d. Shapps argued that families could purchase goods online on a Sunday and wanted to be able to go to the shops for longer as well. \u201cIt is a bit ridiculous and it is time to update these rules.\u201d The SNP has an informal policy of abstaining in votes on matters which do not relate to Scotland. But Angus Robertson, the SNP leader at Westminster, announced last November that the SNP would oppose the plans on the grounds that they could drive down the wages of Scottish workers who enjoy a special Sunday premium. The shopworkers\u2019 union Usdaw warned the SNP that normalising Sunday trading hours in England and Wales would prompt large retailers to set a lower wage for workers across the UK. The government shelved the vote after Robertson\u2019s announcement in November. Whitehall sources said that they had been given indications by the SNP, which recently brokered a new fiscal settlement with the UK government, that the party had changed its position. It had been widely expected that the SNP would abstain in the vote. Hosie denied that the SNP had changed tack under pressure from the Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, ahead of the Holyrood elections in May, who had warned that the \u201crights of Scottish workers must not be subject to a Tory-SNP stitchup in Westminster\u201d. The SNP deputy leader said: \u201cThere\u2019s never ever been any guarantee at all, any understanding, [or] indication that we would be automatically supporting any such measure. There was never any agreement that we would support or abstain to allow this measure to go through.\u201d Hosie added: \u201cOur key concern all along was the protection of premium pay for employees in Scotland. We have listened to the evidence on both sides of this incredibly carefully. \u201cOur judgment is that should this become a UK-wide system without legal protections in place, there would be an inevitable erosion of premium pay for employees in Scotland.\u201d The UK government sought to win over wavering Tory MPs by releasing a letter from the leaders of 102 Conservative councils supporting government plans to give councils the right to zone areas that would be free from restricted trading hours. Brandon Lewis, the communities minister who received the letter, argues that the current law prevents shops that cover more than 3,000 sq ft from opening for more than six hours on a Sunday. Lewis says that allowing department stores, supermarkets and garden centres to open for longer would rejuvenate high streets.",
