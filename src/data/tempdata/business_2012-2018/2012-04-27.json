      "bodyText": "Even before the financial crisis, the Occupy movement and the new era of austerity, the Sunday Times Rich List was an odd kind of fixture in the media landscape. The annual roll call of the wealthiest 1,000 individuals or families in the UK has always triggered the full range of our ambivalent responses to people with staggering amounts of money: envy, admiration, disdain, awe, and that special flavour of inverse snobbery that stems from being convinced that you've spent your life more meaningfully than the head of the Tetra Pak food-packaging empire, whatever the impact on your bank balance. Now, though, for reasons we all understand, attitudes towards the super-rich are changing: disdain is hardening into anger; ambivalence has been replaced with hostility. Despite a still-weak economy, the collective wealth of the 2011 Rich List increased by \u00a360.2bn on the previous year, and in the 2012 list, which is published tomorrow, that divergence looks set to get larger. In the end, the Rich List is only a list, but in a climate such as today's, it inevitably acquires a certain grotesque aspect. The Rich Listers are not merely the 1%, but the 0.01%, and this fanfared celebration of their assets feels like a celebration of things that nobody feels like celebrating: bankers' bonuses, complex corporate tax-avoidance structures, the stifling grip of aristocratic family wealth. Still, in focusing on the Haves and the Have-Nots, let us not forget a third group \u2013 the people you might call the Had Once, But Then Blew It All On A Private Jet With Gold Plumbing In The Bathroom. That's a somewhat unfair way of summarising the fate of the Irish hospitality magnate Sean Quinn (in reality, the near-collapse of Anglo Irish Bank had much more to do with his being declared bankrupt). But it will serve as a general label for those featured today in Weekend magazine's inaugural Not-So-Rich-Any-More List \u2013 a selection of former plutocrats who crashed out of the list in spectacular fashion. Those featured on the list vary widely: some overreached in their business ventures; others overreached in their lavish personal lifestyles; one tried to reach over the laws against fraud. But it is striking that none was done in by circumstances wholly outside their control. Schadenfreude is not an emotion to be proud of, and in the case of the Not-So-Rich-Any-More List, it may not even be warranted: many of those here are almost certainly still vastly wealthier than you or I. (It is a testament to the times in which we live that still having a few million put aside gets you nowhere in the rankings of the rich.) And their having received a modest dose of reality does nothing at all, of course, to ameliorate structural inequalities in the economy. Still, maybe it's useful to be reminded that stratospheric wealth offers no immunity to failure, or to foolish decisions; and that the lives of the mega-rich can be as subject to precipitous ups and downs as anyone else's. If you must indulge in schadenfreude, you might as well direct it at these people. And if you find yourself feeling sorry for them instead, congratulations: you're more empathic than most people, and that's worth much more than an aeroplane bathroom with taps made of gold. Sean Quinn Business: Construction; hospitality Rich List rating: No 12 in 2008, worth \u00a33.73bn Sean Quinn started his career in a literal hole and ended it in a metaphorical one. In 1974, aged 26, he realised his family's 23-acre dairy farm was sitting on vast swaths of gravel and shale. With a single mechanical shovel, Quinn started digging, and all of a sudden he had a profit-making quarry. A year later, he diversified into concrete and cement, and by the early 80s he was making roof tiles. Quinn left school at 15, allegedly unable to read or write, but by 2008, with assets of \u00a33.73bn, he was Ireland's richest man. He had shares in hotel and insurance companies, and all the while he professed a love for the simple life: for Gaelic football, for small-stake poker games on a Tuesday night, and a private jet furnished with gold. But by this year, the jet was gone and, technically, so was the small-stake poker. Following the near collapse of Anglo Irish Bank, in which he had a 25% stake, Quinn was declared bankrupt \u2013 first in Belfast and then, in January, in Dublin. Simon Halabi Business: Property Rich List rating: No 14 in 2007, worth \u00a33bn \"Money,\" Simon Halabi once said, \"is generated by making money, and that has really been my greatest success.\" They are words property tycoon Halabi may now regret, not just because they border on tautology, but because they are no longer true. Halabi was once the 14th richest businessman in Britain. Born in Syria around 50 years ago, he used inherited money to invest in British property. By 2007, he had built a property empire worth \u00a33bn and his investments included the Shard, a soon-to-be-completed London skyscraper; the offices of bankers JP Morgan and insurers Aviva; and Mentmore Towers, the Rothschilds' one-time ancestral seat. Halabi dreamed of turning Mentmore into a six-star hotel, along with 94 Piccadilly, the crumbling former home of Lord Palmerston. His achilles heel was Esporta, a chain of health clubs he bought for \u00a3475m in 2006, but that was in administration by the end of 2007. Then the housing market collapsed, weakening demand for much of his office space, and by 2009 he was heavily in debt. Mentmore was mothballed, and work never started on the derelict 94 Piccadilly. Halabi was declared bankrupt in April 2010, and his last known address was a hotel room in Switzerland. Andrew Davis Business: Hospitality Rich List rating: No 244 in 2010, worth \u00a3292m Andrew Davis's hotel business should really have failed a lot earlier than it did. \"Davis,\" said fellow hotelier Peter Hauser, \"did not understand how to run hotels\", an argument that was underscored in 2004 when seven of the 25 properties in Davis's Von Essen hotel group were struck from the Good Hotel Guide after a series of Fawlty Towers-style bungles. Yet Von Essen kept on growing, and in the following six years Davis's personal wealth almost doubled to reach \u00a3292m. No one was that sure where his money had initially come from, or who he really was. He said he went to Gordonstoun, Prince Charles's old school, but really he went to Reigate Grammar. He claimed Von Essen was named after an aristocratic European relative, though this remains doubtful. All people could really be sure of was his charm. \"A mixture of Benny Hill and Frankie Howerd: immensely entertaining and very raucous,\" Michael Winner once said of the hotelier. \"He could sell a barrel-load of ice to an Eskimo,\" said Lord Roy Vaughan, who himself once sold Davis four hotels, \"and the next day he'd sell him another one.\" But charm could get Davis only so far and in 2011, barely a year after his first \u2013 and only \u2013 appearance on the Sunday Times Rich List, Von Essen finally went into administration. Wensley Haydon-Baillie Business: Pharmaceuticals Rich List rating: Joint 303rd in 1994, worth \u00a340m Herpes was how Wensley Haydon-Baillie first hit the jackpot. In the 1980s, the City financier invested heavily in Porton International, a drugs company that claimed it was developing a cure for the disease. A cure never materialised, but interest in the company was still high enough 10 years later for Haydon-Baillie to sell it at a huge profit. He made other clever investments \u2013 a struggling engineering firm, for example, that he turned into a successful electronics manufacturer \u2013 and he made friends in high places. Prince Michael of Kent was best man at his marriage to Samantha Acland, a secretary. He also had a taste for the high life. He bought some of the largest stately homes in Europe, a collection of Spitfires and six Rolls-Royces, which he supposedly inspected every morning. All this cost too much to maintain and by 1998 Haydon-Baillie was \u00a313m in debt, unable even to pay his television licence. Things may have picked up since: in 2006, it was reported that he had bought two of the world's largest passenger hovercraft, and he now also owns a very big yacht. John Palmer Business: Property; fraud Rich List rating: Joint 76th in 1996, worth \u00a3200m \"John Palmer,\" reported the Sunday Times Rich List in 1996, \"runs a large and lucrative timeshare operation on Tenerife.\" In fact, it was rather more lucrative than it should have been. In 2001, it emerged that Palmer had conned more than 16,000 people into paying \u00a330m for shares in 450 Tenerife holiday homes to which they never received access. He was jailed for eight years, released in 2005, and declared bankrupt. It was not his only brush with authority. In the 80s, Palmer \u2013 a former scrap merchant and coin dealer \u2013 was accused of melting down gold stolen during the 1983 Brink's-Mat heist. Palmer \u2013 nicknamed Goldfinger \u2013 was acquitted, but in 1991 he was separately convicted of mortgage fraud. In 2007, following a seven-year investigation, Spanish authorities imprisoned him for a series of crimes ranging from money laundering to drugs trafficking. He was never charged, was released after two years, but remains on bail. Rival crime bosses are said to have placed a \u00a31m bounty on Palmer's head. John Fleming Business: Construction Rich List rating: No 75 (in Ireland) in 2008, worth \u00a3138m John Fleming was bankrupted by an unfinished block of flats. Ironically, he built his reputation in the construction business by getting the job done. The son of a Cork fisherman, Fleming started out in the 70s building sheds and outhouses for farmers. He was soon a byword for quality, and within a decade had secured major public contracts to build new schools and water pipelines. In the late 80s, he helped build one of the biggest bypasses in Ireland, and in the 90s he began developing hotels and industrial parks. By 2008, Fleming's wealth had reached \u00a3138m and he was the 75th richest person in Ireland. He kept himself grounded. He volunteered with the local lifeboat team, and in 2007 was given a medal in recognition of his long-term service. But by then he had already overstretched himself professionally. At the height of the Irish housing bubble in 2006, Fleming paid over the odds for a residential site in Sandyford, a suburb of Dublin. The development would have housed 880 flats, but the block was only half-finished when the housing market crashed. Fleming's firm was left with debts of \u20ac1bn, his financial house came tumbling down, and he filed for bankruptcy in 2010. Christine and Isabel Maxwell Business: Technology Rich List rating: Joint 227th in 1999, worth \u00a3100m When he died in 1991, newspaper baron Robert Maxwell notoriously left his seven children with nothing but debt. Eight long years passed without a Maxwell in the Rich List \u2013 and then, in 1999, two broke back in at once. Christine and Isabel Maxwell \u2013 twin sisters born in 1951 \u2013 had emigrated to California in the 70s and were now involved in the dotcom boom. They helped run McKinley, an early search engine. In 1995, McKinley was sold to their rivals Excite, with the Maxwell sisters given 850,000 shares. In 1999, Excite was bought by AtHome, an internet service provider, in what was then one of the largest internet mergers. The value of the Maxwells' shares rocketed 2,000% and gave them a windfall of \u00a3100m. But it did not last long. Like many dotcom companies, AtHome peaked at the start of the new millennium and was bankrupt by October 2001. The Maxwells were not destitute, but their stay in the Rich List lasted only two years. Isabel now runs her own communications agency and lives in New York; Christine lives in the south of France.",

Ironically, he built his reputation in&#xa0;the construction business by getting the job done. The son of a&#xa0;Cork fisherman, Fleming started&#xa0;out in the 70s building sheds and outhouses for farmers. He was soon a byword for quality,&#xa0;and&#xa0;within a&#xa0;decade had secured major public contracts to build new schools and water pipelines. In the late 80s, he helped&#xa0;build one of the biggest bypasses in Ireland, and in the 90s he began developing hotels and industrial parks. By 2008, Fleming's&#xa0;wealth had reached \u00a3138m&#xa0;and he was the 75th&#xa0;richest&#xa0;person in Ireland. He kept himself grounded. He&#xa0;volunteered with the local lifeboat team, and in 2007 was given&#xa0;a medal in recognition of his&#xa0;long-term service.</p> <p>But by then he had already overstretched himself professionally. At the height of&#xa0;the&#xa0;Irish housing bubble in&#xa0;2006,&#xa0;Fleming paid over the odds&#xa0;for a residential site in Sandyford, a suburb of Dublin. The&#xa0;development would have housed 880 flats, but the block was&#xa0;only half-finished when the housing market crashed. Fleming's firm was left with debts of \u20ac1bn, his financial house came tumbling&#xa0;down, and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/feb/18/ireland-property-crash-bankruptcy-tourism\" title=\"\"> he filed for bankruptcy in 2010</a><strong>.</strong></p> <h2><strong>Christine and Isabel&#xa0;Maxwell</strong><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-389155866\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/4/24/1335285539155/Maxwell-sisters-001.jpg\" alt=\"Maxwell sisters\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photographs: UPPA Ltd; Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Business: Technology</strong><br><strong>Rich List rating: Joint&#xa0;227th in 1999, worth \u00a3100m</strong><br>When he died in 1991, newspaper baron Robert Maxwell notoriously left his seven children with nothing but debt. Eight long years passed without a Maxwell in the Rich List \u2013 and then, in 1999, two broke back in at once. Christine and Isabel Maxwell \u2013 twin sisters born in 1951 \u2013 had emigrated to California in the 70s and were now involved in the dotcom boom. They helped run McKinley, an early search engine. In 1995, McKinley was sold to their rivals Excite, with the Maxwell sisters given 850,000 shares. In 1999, Excite was bought by AtHome, an internet service provider, in what was then one of the largest internet mergers. The value of the Maxwells' shares rocketed 2,000% and gave them a&#xa0;windfall of \u00a3100m.</p> <p>But it did not last long. Like many dotcom companies, AtHome peaked at the start of the new millennium and was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/29/business/at-home-files-for-bankruptcy-will-sell-a-unit.html\" title=\"\">bankrupt by October 2001</a>. The Maxwells were not destitute, but their stay in the Rich List lasted only two years. Isabel now runs her own communications agency and lives in New York; Christine lives in the south of France.</p>",

A Three spokesman said: \"We are beginning to sense that this is indeed a campaign to push for and protect a potential monopoly position.\" An email dated 13 April to a prospective supporter from a member of EE claimed: \"4G Britain is a not-for-profit group supported by organisations including Everything Everywhere (Orange and T-Mobile), eBay, Autonomy, TheTrainline.com, The Countryside Alliance and London First \u2026 and others.\" In fact, three of these have not joined. A spokesman for Mike Lynch, who sold his Autonomy software company for \u00a37bn last year, said the campaign was presented as a \"coalition of the operators\". He has not signed and is now considering whether to participate. A spokesman for eBay said: \"While we support faster mobile broadband, at no stage did we confirm our involvement.\" London First, which promotes inward investment in the capital, said it declined to sign, on the grounds the campaign does not have cross sector support. EE said it hoped others would be joining in the coming weeks. \"Everything Everywhere is proud to be helping raise awareness of the benefits of next generation telecommunications services. The 4G Britain website has been initiated by our organisation to help educate and build understanding of the benefits of 4G for consumers and businesses in the UK. It is open to all, and is intended to be an ongoing initiative which we hope many organisations will join in the coming weeks and in the future. \"We'd like to make clear that, notwithstanding the campaign, today's existing operators have an opportunity to deploy 4G services, subject to: their willingness to invest; that they have requested from Ofcom a variation to their licence; and that this has been granted. The suggestion that this campaign is designed to seek an unfair benefit for Everything Everywhere ahead of other telecoms companies is wrong. \"It is disappointing that some of our competitors are falsely claiming that an as yet unlaunched website, being built to help stimulate awareness amongst the public of potential benefits of 4G, is in any way bad for consumers and the wider British economy. This is a ridiculous position for them to adopt especially when you consider that when 4G becomes available it will bring significant levels of investment and job creation to the UK.\" The Association for Lobbying Transparency whose members include Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, has been campaigning for the government's proposed register of lobbyists to include charities and not for profit organisations in order to promote openness. Tamasin Cave of the ALT said: \"4GBritain looks very much like it is basically Everything Everywhere. It has been initiated by the firm, who appear to be the group's sole financial backers, and they have paid PR people to run it. Using third parties to push a line is a common lobbying tactic \u2013 it's about separating the message from what could be seen as a self-interested messenger. They understand that people are more likely to pledge support if its Stephen Fry rather than a commercial interest doing the asking.\" EE points out that it has always been open about its involvement, declaring its role in meetings, phonecalls and emails. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 April 2012 after Jonathan Ross's spokesman changed his comment from saying the presenter \"knows nothing about it, and will not be involved\" to: \"We have been approached and Jonathan is still talking.\"",

After Co-op missed deadlines to reach a formal agreement over the terms of the sale, Lloyds opened the door to talks with NBNK, the acquisition vehicle fronted by former Northern Rock boss Gary Hoffman. The sale of the branches \u2013 codenamed Verde by Lloyds \u2013 is required under EU state aid rules because of the \u00a320bn of taxpayer funds pumped into the enlarged Lloyds after its takeover of HBOS in the autumn of 2008. But Lloyds will not embark on any discussions with NBNK until it has received assurance that the Financial Services Authority is satisfied with NBNK's ability to take control of the branches and raise the funds to buy them. Lloyds, just under 40% owned by the taxpayer, also wants NBNK to prove its potential bid offers more value to its shareholders than a stock market flotation of the branches. NBNK, which failed last year to be selected as preferred bidder, described the Verde deal as \"a unique opportunity to create a new nationwide challenger bank and brand that will shake up UK high street banking and operate in the interests of its customers\".

More than one in five investors failed to support the re-election of Carnwath, a veteran of many boardroom battles, to the board \u2013 a huge protest given that directors usually expect near-unanimous support for their positions.</p> <p>The bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, had to ask the assembled shareholders to behave in a \"responsible\" and \"adult\" manner after a number of heckles from the floor while Carnwath was attempting to defend the pay policies.</p> <p>The bank's pay structure has run into controversy not just for the pay of Diamond, but also the fact that more was handed out to staff in bonuses last year \u2013 \u00a32.1bn \u2013 than in dividends to shareholders \u2013 \u00a3700m. Shareholders have also been angered that the bank paid a \u00a35.7m tax liability incurred by Diamond when he relocated from New York to London to become chief executive on 1 January last year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://reports.barclays.com/cr11/servicepages/downloads/files/entire_barclays_cr2011.pdf\" title=\"\">bank also published its first ever report on \"citizenship\" </a>\u2013 one of Diamond's priorities \u2013 in which it revealed it had paid \u00a3300m in UK corporation tax. The bank reported \u00a35.9bn of profits in 2011 but stressed it made \u00a31bn of profits in the UK. Last year the bank was forced to admit it paid just \u00a3113m in UK corporation tax in 2009 \u2013 a year when it rang up a record \u00a311.6bn of profits.</p> <p>It also defended its use of Cayman Islands companies, saying that the total profit not taxed in these entities was less than \u00a31m in 2010 and 2011.</p> <p>The result of the vote, announced after a two-hour annual meeting attended by more than 800 private investors, stunned hardened City observers. Few had expected a protest vote of more than 20%, after a 10% protest last year, because the existence of a number of large, supportive investors would reduce the protest.</p> <p>Business secretary Vince Cable welcomed the news, saying shareholders were \"doing what they are supposed to do, which is holding executives to account\". It coincided with the end of his consultation on handing shareholders more powers over executive pay. If his consultation had already become law, Barclays would have been one of the first companies to have to comply with his proposal that those failing to get 75% support on pay would be forced to issue an explanatory statement to the market.</p> <p>Even after changing the terms of the bonuses for Diamond and the finance director Chris Lucas last week, only 73% of investors supported the remuneration report \u2013 68.5% if deliberate abstentions were included. For Carnwath, fewer than 80% voted in favour - 79.15% \u2013 and deliberate abstentions drove this down to 77%.</p> <p>While a veteran of many boardrooms, Carnwath has only been chair of the Barclays remuneration committee since July and suffered a rough ride as she read from a prepared script, saying the bank \"reduced awards significantly in 2011\". To this one shareholder shouted \"not enough\" to both laughter and applause.</p> <p>She pressed on: \"We will continue to seek to push down remuneration levels in the context of the environment in which we operate.\" To this there was a cry of: \"Why have you only just woken up to this?\" Agius insisted that bonuses had to be paid. He apologised, but only for his handling of the issue rather than the size of the deals. He said: \"It's not an option to pay zero bonus.

      "bodyText": "Shareholders have demonstrated their mounting anger over runaway boardroom pay, delivering a huge protest against Barclays pay policies \u2013 including the \u00a317m package for chief executive Bob Diamond. Nearly a third of shareholders failed to back the remuneration report at a sometimes hostile annual meeting in the Royal Festival Hall, London, where one shareholder warned of the damage to the bank's reputation because of its pay deals. Shareholders also handed a severe rebuke to Alison Carnwath, the non-executive director who sanctioned the pay deals. More than one in five investors failed to support the re-election of Carnwath, a veteran of many boardroom battles, to the board \u2013 a huge protest given that directors usually expect near-unanimous support for their positions. The bank's chairman, Marcus Agius, had to ask the assembled shareholders to behave in a \"responsible\" and \"adult\" manner after a number of heckles from the floor while Carnwath was attempting to defend the pay policies. The bank's pay structure has run into controversy not just for the pay of Diamond, but also the fact that more was handed out to staff in bonuses last year \u2013 \u00a32.1bn \u2013 than in dividends to shareholders \u2013 \u00a3700m. Shareholders have also been angered that the bank paid a \u00a35.7m tax liability incurred by Diamond when he relocated from New York to London to become chief executive on 1 January last year. The bank also published its first ever report on \"citizenship\" \u2013 one of Diamond's priorities \u2013 in which it revealed it had paid \u00a3300m in UK corporation tax. The bank reported \u00a35.9bn of profits in 2011 but stressed it made \u00a31bn of profits in the UK. Last year the bank was forced to admit it paid just \u00a3113m in UK corporation tax in 2009 \u2013 a year when it rang up a record \u00a311.6bn of profits. It also defended its use of Cayman Islands companies, saying that the total profit not taxed in these entities was less than \u00a31m in 2010 and 2011. The result of the vote, announced after a two-hour annual meeting attended by more than 800 private investors, stunned hardened City observers. Few had expected a protest vote of more than 20%, after a 10% protest last year, because the existence of a number of large, supportive investors would reduce the protest. Business secretary Vince Cable welcomed the news, saying shareholders were \"doing what they are supposed to do, which is holding executives to account\". It coincided with the end of his consultation on handing shareholders more powers over executive pay. If his consultation had already become law, Barclays would have been one of the first companies to have to comply with his proposal that those failing to get 75% support on pay would be forced to issue an explanatory statement to the market. Even after changing the terms of the bonuses for Diamond and the finance director Chris Lucas last week, only 73% of investors supported the remuneration report \u2013 68.5% if deliberate abstentions were included. For Carnwath, fewer than 80% voted in favour - 79.15% \u2013 and deliberate abstentions drove this down to 77%. While a veteran of many boardrooms, Carnwath has only been chair of the Barclays remuneration committee since July and suffered a rough ride as she read from a prepared script, saying the bank \"reduced awards significantly in 2011\". To this one shareholder shouted \"not enough\" to both laughter and applause. She pressed on: \"We will continue to seek to push down remuneration levels in the context of the environment in which we operate.\" To this there was a cry of: \"Why have you only just woken up to this?\" Agius insisted that bonuses had to be paid. He apologised, but only for his handling of the issue rather than the size of the deals. He said: \"It's not an option to pay zero bonus. We would be so far out of line with our competitors that the commercial consequences would be dire.\" One shareholder, Patrick Evershed \u2013 a former employee of fund manager New Star \u2013 at first spoke in support of the bank, then he said: \"All the good work has been undone by the pay row\". He added the bank was \"dividing society \u2026 doing a lot of damage to the reputation of the bank.\" Agius was repeatedly questioned by one shareholder about whether anyone had lost their jobs or bonuses over mis-selling payment protection insurance, for which the bank has taken a \u00a31.3bn provision. Diamond intervened, to say: \"There is no-one employed at Barclays today that was part of the management decisions that led to PPI.\" The action in the hall was overshadowed by the size of the rebellion. Big investors such as F&amp;C, Fidelity and M&amp;G were among institutions to vote against. Robert Talbut, chairman of the investment committee at the Association of British Insurers, whose members control a fifth of the stock market, said the result showed investors take executive pay seriously. \"Getting it right is an important part of a successful company. All banks face a challenge to improve their investment case by getting a better balance of returns to shareholders, payments to employees and capital retention,\" Talbut said. David Paterson, head of corporate governance at the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), said: \"The vote may have been passed, but the level of dissent about executive pay at Barclays needs to be taken seriously by the company and by the rest of the banking industry\" After the meeting, Diamond told the Guardian he conceded the row over pay was a \"distraction\" from his goals. \"We have do more on our journey to our 13% return (on equity).

      "standfirst": "Hedge fund group jumps more than 14%, while market shrugs off latest eurozone woes", 
      "body": "<p>Nick Fletcher</p> <p><strong>Man</strong>, the world's largest listed hedge fund, lead the way, jumping more than 14%, as the FTSE 100 finished the week on a positive note despite the continuing eurozone crisis.</p> <p>The company's shares have been under pressure recently on worries about its future growth and the performance of its key AHL fund and 2010's underwhelming acquisition, GLG. They were lifted earlier in the week as UBS said Man could be vulnerable to a takeover at a 50% premium to its current price, perhaps by a north American asset manager.</p> <p>Analysts at Societe Generale yesterday played down talk of a bid, but even so raised their recommendation on the company's shares from hold to buy following its recent 35% decline. SocGen's Michael Sanderson said:</p> <blockquote> In our view the positive momentum was too great following its results in March, and we now believe negative momentum is too great given the proven fundamentals of the business. Despite the market backdrop for hedge fund sales being challenging and the risks at Man being finely balanced, we see upside being driven by the likely improvement in either the industry backdrop or the performance of AHL (or both). <br> </blockquote> <p>On the prospect of a bid, Sanderson said there was a low probability of this happening:</p> <blockquote> Given many of the benefits that an acquirer could extract with Man are achievable by the business itself in the next twelve months, there would appear little merit for bidders or shareholders to consider a bid unless it was at a significant premium to the current price. Man's stock traded 50% higher within the last six weeks and since then there has been little change at the business other than a negative period at AHL and some overall market weakness. As such, while a bid cannot be ruled out, we consider any acquisition price would have to be significantly in excess of that level given the speed that Man's stock could recover if any evidence of better industry demand or AHL performance emerges in the near term. </blockquote> <p>There were also reports that unhappy shareholders had given chief executive Peter Clarke around nine months to turn the company around. Man, which issues a first quarter trading update next week, rose 13.25p to 107p. This marks its first positive week in six weeks.</p> <p>Overall, investors shrugged off poor unemployment figures from Spain and a downgrade of the country's credit rating, as well as disappointing US GDP figures, and the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> closed 28.39 points higher at 5777.11. Over the week the index was barely changed, up just five points. But that disguises a 103 point fall on Monday following news that Francois Hollande had won the first round of the French election and the Dutch government had collapsed over disagreements about its proposed austerity budget. In the UK, new figures revealed the country had fallen back into recession.</p> <p>By the end of the week some of the eurozone fears had eased, however, and a number of positive corporate updates from the likes of Amazon, Apple, Ford and Sanofi also helped the market regain ground.

      "bodyText": "Nick Fletcher Man, the world's largest listed hedge fund, lead the way, jumping more than 14%, as the FTSE 100 finished the week on a positive note despite the continuing eurozone crisis. The company's shares have been under pressure recently on worries about its future growth and the performance of its key AHL fund and 2010's underwhelming acquisition, GLG. They were lifted earlier in the week as UBS said Man could be vulnerable to a takeover at a 50% premium to its current price, perhaps by a north American asset manager. Analysts at Societe Generale yesterday played down talk of a bid, but even so raised their recommendation on the company's shares from hold to buy following its recent 35% decline. SocGen's Michael Sanderson said: In our view the positive momentum was too great following its results in March, and we now believe negative momentum is too great given the proven fundamentals of the business. Despite the market backdrop for hedge fund sales being challenging and the risks at Man being finely balanced, we see upside being driven by the likely improvement in either the industry backdrop or the performance of AHL (or both). On the prospect of a bid, Sanderson said there was a low probability of this happening: Given many of the benefits that an acquirer could extract with Man are achievable by the business itself in the next twelve months, there would appear little merit for bidders or shareholders to consider a bid unless it was at a significant premium to the current price. Man's stock traded 50% higher within the last six weeks and since then there has been little change at the business other than a negative period at AHL and some overall market weakness. As such, while a bid cannot be ruled out, we consider any acquisition price would have to be significantly in excess of that level given the speed that Man's stock could recover if any evidence of better industry demand or AHL performance emerges in the near term. There were also reports that unhappy shareholders had given chief executive Peter Clarke around nine months to turn the company around. Man, which issues a first quarter trading update next week, rose 13.25p to 107p. This marks its first positive week in six weeks. Overall, investors shrugged off poor unemployment figures from Spain and a downgrade of the country's credit rating, as well as disappointing US GDP figures, and the FTSE 100 closed 28.39 points higher at 5777.11. Over the week the index was barely changed, up just five points. But that disguises a 103 point fall on Monday following news that Francois Hollande had won the first round of the French election and the Dutch government had collapsed over disagreements about its proposed austerity budget. In the UK, new figures revealed the country had fallen back into recession. By the end of the week some of the eurozone fears had eased, however, and a number of positive corporate updates from the likes of Amazon, Apple, Ford and Sanofi also helped the market regain ground. Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said: After a terrible start to the week, where it looked like we could be in for a more prolonged move to the downside following dire manufacturing data from across the globe and the prospects of a new anti-European president of France, slowly but surely we've clawed back those losses to almost end the week in positive territory. All this with a worsening macro economic backdrop where the UK retrenched back into an official recession, the world's biggest economy slowed and Spanish unemployment hit a record high. The lack of a bigger and broader sell off is a testament to the strength of the stock markets which in the past few weeks have suffered sharp moves to the downside, but have always been quick to regain the lost ground. Barclays was among the risers, up 10.1p to 223.1p despite a shareholder revolt over pay. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 0.77p to 24.35p but Lloyds Banking Group lost 0.285p to 31.19p following further problems with its proposed branch sales. Pearson, the publishing group behind Penguin books and the Financial Times, said its first year profits will be lower than the same time last year, but investors were unruffled by the comments. In a statement to co-incide with its annual meeting, the company blamed the shortfall on the fact its operating profits are heavily weighted to the second half, as well as investment and restructuring costs, and the sale of its stake in information group FTSE International. Overall it said trading was in line with expectations, and its strong position in US educational services has helped it overcome a weak market. Pearson put on 17p to \u00a311.67. BG rose 13.5p to \u00a314.44 after the gases group sold its 40% stake in a liquified natural gas terminal in Quintero, Chile, for $352m to Spain's Enagas. AstraZeneca added 14p to 2680.5p as it recovered from Thursday's announcement of the departure of chief executive David Brennan and a cut in its full year earnings forecast.

GlaxoSmithKline, which also released disappointing first quarter results during the week, moved 3.5p higher to 1423.5p after it received European approval for its nimenrix immunisation treatment against meningococcal disease. CRH, the Irish building materials group, climbed 48p to \u00a312.68 following an upgrade from JP Morgan Cazenove, which moved from underweight to overweight.

And now one cannot suppress the thought that Kim's election could turn into a disaster for the cause of development. His tirade in 2000 against the liberal reforms that have transformed countries like India and China into global growth engines, reduced poverty and benefited marginalised groups shows that he lacked good judgment on fundamental issues. No one recalls any expression of regret by him, which suggests that he persists in such folly \u2013 and would use conditionality to turn the clock back on decades of progress in development economics. But my fear is that Kim would be a disaster even on healthcare issues \u2013 an area where he has rightly earned credit for his work on Aids, malaria and tuberculosis. Thanks to the economic growth that resulted from the reforms that he denounced, countries such as India and Brazil now have higher revenues to spend on healthcare for the poor, among other public goods. As a result, the public health questions that Kim will face at the World Bank are very different from the \"big\" diseases with which he dealt in the past. India, for example, is struggling with the balance between public and private provisions of medical care for routine health problems, and with questions of medical training and availability (that is, whether India should have \"barefoot doctors\" or aim for only fully qualified practitioners). Can Kim lead on these and other issues that are beyond his experience? Foreboding is in order. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2012",

Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at City Index, said: A key focus will be on US GDP rates at 1.30pm, where US growth is expected to slow in the first quarter to 2.5% from 3% in the prior quarter. Whilst any number below 2.5% growth will likely raise concerns over US growth this year, these concerns could be watered down by the fact that weaker than expected US growth would likely be interpreted by investors as increasing pressure on the Federal Reserve into supportive action in the form of more quantitative easing. Among the mid-caps chip designer CSR has climbed 13.5p to 224.1p. On Thursday the company was the subject of a spate of renewed takeover talk.",
