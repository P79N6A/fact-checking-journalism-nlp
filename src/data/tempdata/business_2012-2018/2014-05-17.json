Hayward was handed the gig after almost a year as Glencore's interim chairman, and the view is that he might favour Glasenberg over outsiders. A well-known fund management group said last week that it had sold all its Glencore shares as: \"This [Hayward's] appointment suggests a company that is public but feels like it is being run as a private company.\" Who'd have thought it?",

      "bodyText": "'EMU [European Monetary Union], involving the fixing of exchange rates, could create disequilibria between different areas of the community since it would remove, or render less effective, the normal powers of governments to compensate for differences of performance by varying exchange rates, taxes and rates of interest.\" This quotation comes from volume two of The Official History of Britain and the European Community by the distinguished British diplomat Sir Stephen Wall. With the Conservatives committed to a referendum if they win the next election, and all the hot air surrounding the Ukip phenomenon, I suspect that many people will be consulting Sir Stephen's book, either to remind themselves of the sterling efforts a previous generation took to enable us to join the European Union, or to learn an important chunk of our recent history for the first time. For pro-Europeans of my generation, the idea that this country may have to go through the whole process yet again of deciding whether it wishes to remain in the EU is tiresome to say the least. But it is important at this point to distinguish between being a British \"pro-European\" and being a supporter of membership of the eurozone. Which brings me to the relevance of the above quotation, which was from a summary of the conclusions of an internal Whitehall study that was never published, but in essence anticipated the central points of the famous \"five tests\" conducted decades later by the Treasury, under instructions from Gordon Brown when he was chancellor. The study, by retired diplomat Sir Bernard Burrows, was commissioned by the prime minister, Edward Heath, shortly before the February 1974 general election. Mr Heath, as he was then, had successfully negotiated our entry in 1973 to what was then the European Economic Community. But now they were talking of European \"union\", and Heath had wanted to know what his new European partners meant by this. At this stage he was not to know that they would start the revolution without him, because the result of the February 1974 election on \"who governs the country\" was that it was no longer to be Ted Heath. Back came Harold Wilson to Downing Street, after unexpectedly losing office in 1970. In 1974, Wilson was as surprised to be elected as Heath was to be ejected. But the Labour party was divided over Europe. As Wall writes in his most engaging and unstuffy \"official history\", Wilson \"had seen that the only way to win a decisive victory over the anti-marketeers in the Labour party was to go beyond the party to the country at large\". Hence the 1975 referendum, with a two to one majority in favour of staying inside what was successively known over the years as the Common Market, the European Economic Community and the European Community. According to Gallup polls, the decisive issues for the electorate in favour of our staying put were: defence, Britain's voice in international affairs; Britain's position in the world; and hopes for the future of \"our children\". The possibility one day of monetary union did not figure in the campaign. But soon after the 1974 election, James Callaghan, who was foreign secretary, had asked the same question as Heath, and Burrows was allowed to continue his quest to work out what was meant by \"European union\". Burrows's report was never published, which was probably just as well, because Wall tells us Burrows found it \"impossible in practice to draw a clear distinction between European union and EMU\". So much water has flowed under the metaphorical bridge between the UK and the continent that the British still seem to refer to \"Europe\" as though we were not part of it. During the 1974-75 \"renegotiations\" (up to a point) of the terms on which we joined the European Community, foreign secretary Callaghan was heavily involved, with a lot of help from his junior minister, Roy Hattersley. The talk is that, if the Conservatives win the next election, George Osborne wishes to be foreign secretary. This would serve two purposes: he would be where the action is, and would abandon the Treasury before the chickens of his so-called \"long-term strategy\" come home to roost. Meanwhile, thanks to the reaction to the five tests that Burrows so cleverly anticipated, we did not join the single currency and retain freedom of decision-making when it comes to interest rates and the exchange rate. This exemption does not apply to new applicants to join the EU, who are obliged to sign up to the euro. Ours really is a special relationship. British business \u2013 often foreign-owned! \u2013 overwhelmingly wishes to retain the advantages of being within the EU, but British economic policy is not constrained by the sado-monetarism and fiscal flagellation that predominate within the eurozone. Nevertheless, economic policy in this country could have been a lot better handled, as the Bank of England's monetary policy committee knows only too well.",

Statisticians in Canada found that when the population of hares was big and growing, the lynx thrived because there was plentiful prey. The population of lynx went up and they killed more and more hares. Eventually, there were too few hares left and the lynx starved. The population of lynx went down and the number of hares started to rise again.</p> <p>This story has a bearing on the way the UK economy works. For the past 30 years, one of the big aims of policy has been to make the labour market more flexible. Trade unions have been curbed, industries have been privatised, welfare reformed and employment protection reduced. The balance of power between labour and capital has been tilted decisively in favour of the latter.</p> <p>The evidence of this is all around. There are 1.3m jobs on zero-hour contracts; wages can barely keep pace with price increases, even with unemployment coming down at a fair lick. Around half of the jobs created in the past year have been for the self-employed, with the suspicion that many of those \"running their own business\" are doing so involuntarily.</p> <p>This is the flexible labour market in action. It is what has distinguished the UK economy from some of the more heavily regulated economies in the rest of Europe. Supporters of the reforms of the past three decades say the flexible labour market is the reason the jobless rate is around half the average for the eurozone. Critics say that the smashing of organised labour and the triumph of management is bad for workers, bad for growth and ultimately bad for employers.</p> <p>Vince Cable can now be added to the list of those who wonder whether the labour market has become too flexible. The business secretary is right to pose the question because there are three big downsides to the way it works now.</p> <p>The first is that the taxpayer ends up subsidising low pay through the tax credits and benefits system. There are now more people in poverty who are working than are jobless.</p> <p>The second problem is that the loss of labour's bargaining power has meant the share of national income taken by wages has fallen. That has created a problem of weak demand, which in the buildup to the financial crisis was solved by households taking on more debt. It was a period of rising house prices and equity withdrawal.</p> <p>When the crisis broke, individuals became more debt-averse. They started to pay off some of what they had borrowed and were reluctant to take out new loans. What needed to happen was for real wages to grow, since that would have allowed living standards to rise while indebtedness fell. Instead, real wages have fallen by 8%, and ultra-low interest rates have been required to get people borrowing again. Household debt is on the way back up again.</p> <p>The final problem is that the surfeit of cheap, insecure labour discourages investment. There is little inducement for firms to buy expensive new kit when demand rises, because they can always hire inexpensive labour that can be summarily dismissed later.</p> <p>What does all this mean? It means that in the long term there is a clear choice. Either the power of labour will be increased by full employment, stronger trade unions and collective bargaining or the flexible labour market will arrive at its ultimate destination: a form of capitalism that cannot function without excessive debt; is marked by low wages, low investment and low productivity; and which eventually ends up eating itself.</p> <p>Britain is well advanced down that road. As with the lynx, there is a price to be paid for slaughtering too many&#xa0;hares.</p> <h2>Pay battle hots up<br></h2> <p>As the weather gets warmer, so does the temperature at the annual shareholder meetings that take place at this time of year. Last week, investors at Hiscox, BG&#xa0;and ITV joined their peers at Pearson, Standard Chartered and AstraZeneca in registering their concerns about big bonuses. But a serious blow had yet to be landed.</p> <p>And then it finally happened. Vince Cable's binding vote on remuneration policies claimed its first victim: the FTSE 250 engineering company Kentz. Based in Jersey, Kentz was not only the first to have its remuneration policy opposed but also have its remuneration report voted down at the same time.</p> <p>The significance? The vote on the remuneration report is one that has been in place for 10 years and covers pay that was handed out in the past. It is advisory. Companies can ignore it \u2013 but at their peril, as they risk a bad run with shareholders in the future. The vote on the remuneration policy is binding: it cannot be ignored and was introduced by the business secretary in October to cover the pay plans for the coming three years.</p> <p>For Kentz, which had managed to avoid putting its pay deals to a vote until this year by exploiting a loophole created by its registration in Jersey, it was a moment of shame.</p> <p>But it is one that has been narrowly avoided by others. The Lloyd's of London insurer Hiscox, for instance, had a 42% vote against its remuneration policy. Standard Chartered had suffered a rebellion on a similar scale the week before.</p> <p>Little wonder, then, that HSBC <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/13/hsbc-talks-shareholder-revolt-chairman-pay-douglas-flint-share-bonus\" title=\"\">took steps to head off a full-scale row </a>over proposals to hand its chairman Douglas Flint up to \u00a32.2m in shares at this week's shareholder gathering.</p> <p>HSBC said Flint would be more likely get a smaller sum and only as a \"one-off\": a valiant attempt to show it is listening to concerns. But shareholders may still ask if any bank chairman should be handed a bonus \u2013 as is being proposed here \u2013 for working to improve relationships with regulators. The HSBC vote will be one to watch.</p> <h2>Engineering a manufacturing boom</h2> <p>Celebrations to mark 175 years of train building in Derby were held last week at Bombardier's factory, which is Britain's oldest surviving rail plant.</p> <p>With his thoughts on the 2015 election, transport secretary and member for Derbyshire Dales Patrick McLoughlin pointed to the renewed optimism around Bombardier as a sign that the economy is now back on track.</p> <p>Yet the important contracts that have kept Bombardier's historic Litchurch Lane works afloat did not come from the private sector, and were not the export orders that George Osborne craves. They were government-backed contracts. Had McLoughlin not signed off a \u00a31bn deal to build trains for Crossrail back in February, it could have been 175 and out for Derby.</p> <p>This economy wasn't sustained by Osborneomics but by the Keynesian stimulus of a public infrastructure scheme: digging the giant Crossrail tunnels under London. Good news for Derby, and the supply chain, but a long way from evidence of a sustainable manufacturing-led recovery.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 May 2014. An earlier version said that around 80%, rather than half, of the jobs created in the past year have been for the self-employed.</p>",

The first is that the taxpayer ends up subsidising low pay through the tax credits and benefits system. There are now more people in poverty who are working than are jobless. The second problem is that the loss of labour's bargaining power has meant the share of national income taken by wages has fallen. That has created a problem of weak demand, which in the buildup to the financial crisis was solved by households taking on more debt. It was a period of rising house prices and equity withdrawal. When the crisis broke, individuals became more debt-averse. They started to pay off some of what they had borrowed and were reluctant to take out new loans. What needed to happen was for real wages to grow, since that would have allowed living standards to rise while indebtedness fell. Instead, real wages have fallen by 8%, and ultra-low interest rates have been required to get people borrowing again. Household debt is on the way back up again. The final problem is that the surfeit of cheap, insecure labour discourages investment. There is little inducement for firms to buy expensive new kit when demand rises, because they can always hire inexpensive labour that can be summarily dismissed later. What does all this mean? It means that in the long term there is a clear choice. Either the power of labour will be increased by full employment, stronger trade unions and collective bargaining or the flexible labour market will arrive at its ultimate destination: a form of capitalism that cannot function without excessive debt; is marked by low wages, low investment and low productivity; and which eventually ends up eating itself. Britain is well advanced down that road. As with the lynx, there is a price to be paid for slaughtering too many hares. Pay battle hots up As the weather gets warmer, so does the temperature at the annual shareholder meetings that take place at this time of year. Last week, investors at Hiscox, BG and ITV joined their peers at Pearson, Standard Chartered and AstraZeneca in registering their concerns about big bonuses. But a serious blow had yet to be landed. And then it finally happened. Vince Cable's binding vote on remuneration policies claimed its first victim: the FTSE 250 engineering company Kentz. Based in Jersey, Kentz was not only the first to have its remuneration policy opposed but also have its remuneration report voted down at the same time. The significance? The vote on the remuneration report is one that has been in place for 10 years and covers pay that was handed out in the past. It is advisory. Companies can ignore it \u2013 but at their peril, as they risk a bad run with shareholders in the future. The vote on the remuneration policy is binding: it cannot be ignored and was introduced by the business secretary in October to cover the pay plans for the coming three years. For Kentz, which had managed to avoid putting its pay deals to a vote until this year by exploiting a loophole created by its registration in Jersey, it was a moment of shame. But it is one that has been narrowly avoided by others. The Lloyd's of London insurer Hiscox, for instance, had a 42% vote against its remuneration policy. Standard Chartered had suffered a rebellion on a similar scale the week before. Little wonder, then, that HSBC took steps to head off a full-scale row over proposals to hand its chairman Douglas Flint up to \u00a32.2m in shares at this week's shareholder gathering. HSBC said Flint would be more likely get a smaller sum and only as a \"one-off\": a valiant attempt to show it is listening to concerns. But shareholders may still ask if any bank chairman should be handed a bonus \u2013 as is being proposed here \u2013 for working to improve relationships with regulators. The HSBC vote will be one to watch. Engineering a manufacturing boom Celebrations to mark 175 years of train building in Derby were held last week at Bombardier's factory, which is Britain's oldest surviving rail plant. With his thoughts on the 2015 election, transport secretary and member for Derbyshire Dales Patrick McLoughlin pointed to the renewed optimism around Bombardier as a sign that the economy is now back on track. Yet the important contracts that have kept Bombardier's historic Litchurch Lane works afloat did not come from the private sector, and were not the export orders that George Osborne craves. They were government-backed contracts. Had McLoughlin not signed off a \u00a31bn deal to build trains for Crossrail back in February, it could have been 175 and out for Derby. This economy wasn't sustained by Osborneomics but by the Keynesian stimulus of a public infrastructure scheme: digging the giant Crossrail tunnels under London. Good news for Derby, and the supply chain, but a long way from evidence of a sustainable manufacturing-led recovery. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 May 2014. An earlier version said that around 80%, rather than half, of the jobs created in the past year have been for the self-employed.",

      "bodyText": "The perception that high-achieving businesswomen are more vulnerable than their male counterparts to being abruptly fired \u2013 pushed off the \"glass cliff\" in the contemporary corporate vernacular \u2013 has been borne out by a new study from a global management consultancy. Researchers at Strategy&amp;, formerly known as Booz &amp; Company, found that women are forced out of chief executive positions more than a third of the time, while only a quarter of men in similar positions suffer the same fate. The precarious position of women in the highest echelons of power \u2013 illustrated last week by the dramatic departures of Jill Abramson and Natalie Nougayr\u00e8de as the editors of the New York Times and Le Monde \u2013 remains a stubborn fact of corporate life. According to the authors of the 2013 Chief Executive Study, women's higher rate of failure is not because they are placed in more challenging roles or set up to fail. The research looked at CEO turnover over the past decade at the top of the world's 2,500 largest public companies and found that, while women represent only 3% of new CEOs, they are often forced out of top jobs sooner. The report finds that men and women are broadly comparable in every area \u2013except one: \"Women are more often outsiders,\" says co-author Ken Favaro. \"So they're more vulnerable. They don't know the organisation. They can't diagnose the problems as quickly and don't understand the culture or how to get it to work for them \u2013 and they aren't necessarily given more time to deliver.\" While the proportion of women in the CEO class has doubled to nearly 4% in the past five years, a figure that the study's authors believe could rise to 33% by 2040, the sex norms of global corporate leadership remain stubbornly hard to shift. With a smaller internal leadership pool to choose from, companies hiring female executives from outside are also likely to be less tolerant of shortcomings than they are with executives groomed in-house. And external CEOs are seven times more likely to be dismissed after a short tenure. \"We tend to like those that are most like us,\" says Favaro. \"Sadly, company boards are still mostly men, and they're more inclined to pull the trigger on women if things aren't working out. Women are treated more harshly by men because there are more men in the boardroom.\" As long as this lasts, he adds, \"women will be at a disadvantage\". Last week, after claims that Abramson was paid significantly less than her male predecessor at the New York Times had been challenged by the owning Sulzberger family, reasons for her dismissal fell back on cliches no less likely to cause offence. Abramson was described as \"bossy\" \u2013 a term that, at least in the US, is loaded with sexist hostility. On Saturday afternoon, New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr released a statement detailing his decision to fire Abramson and responding to the growing controversy that gender played a role in her dismissal. He said a pattern of behaviour that included \"arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her, inadequate communication and the public mistreatment of colleagues\" was behind her dismissal. Earlier this year Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg launched a campaign to stamp out \"bossy\", claiming that it discourages young women from developing leadership skills. \"I'm not bossy. I'm the boss,\" announced Beyonc\u00e9 in one of Sandberg's anti-bossy TV adverts. The same issue appears to have brought down Nougayr\u00e8de, who had covered the Chechen wars for Le Monde before being forced out by a staff insurrection at the paper. Faced with such treatment, many female CEOs are choosing to not go quietly over the glass cliff. In 2009, Carol Bartz became chief executive of Yahoo!, but her appointment was viewed less as a victory for women than as evidence that women are more willing to accept positions at companies with no future \u2013 and then take the fall. After Bartz was fired two years later, she characterised Yahoo!'s board as \"doofuses\" who \"fucked me over\". While the authors of Strategy&amp;'s report refuse to comment specifically on the saga at the New York Times, Favaro believes that Abramson's experience at the paper was \"not inconsistent\" with its findings: \"She wasn't given a whole lot of time to develop her track record and earn her tenure.\" Gary Neilson, another co-author of the report, believes the data, though thin, shows an improving situation. While women may be forced out of companies faster, they are coming in faster than they are going out. Neilson believes that as companies start to do a better job of developing internal female executive talent, they will be less likely to look outside to fill top positions. That, in turn, will reduce the risk that women are taking top jobs at companies that may already be in crisis, experiencing performance problems or be in transition. In 20 years this is all going to be quite different, says Neilsen. As more women move up the corporate ladder and sit on boards, companies will have a stable source of homegrown talent. \"The data is clear \u2013 being an outsider is a tough situation,\" he says. Companies care about performance, their boards are under pressure, so they need to be doing a better job developing female talent internally. The situation is, he says, improving rapidly \u2013 \"but from a very small base\".",

    "webTitle": "Nobel winner tells Pfizer: give us firm promises, and for 10 years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Paul Nurse, the Nobel prize-winning scientist and president of the Royal Society, has a message for Pfizer, the US drugs company trying to gobble up AstraZeneca in the biggest-ever foreign takeover of a British company: \"We don't trust you.\" Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, has been desperately trying to win Nurse's support for the proposed \u00a363bn deal. So far he has failed. \"I told them, people don't trust you,\" Nurse said in the Royal Society's John Nash-designed offices overlooking the Mall in central London. \"The public don't trust you. I think the government isn't happy either \u2026 and I don't think the scientific community is at all happy.\" Winning over the UK's scientists \u2013 particularly Nurse, widely regarded as the most influential \u2013 is vital if Pfizer is going to succeed in gaining public and political support for a takeover before a City deadline on 26 May. While it initially appeared that the government would not put any obstacles in the way of the proposed deal, the scale of the backlash from scientists has forced the prime minister and the chancellor to demand ever firmer assurances over British jobs and research. Vince Cable, the business secretary, refused to \"rule out intervention\", and shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna raised the stakes further by saying last week he would block the deal if Labour won next year's general election. Read has declared that the deal will be \"a win-win for society, a win-win for shareholders, and a win-win for stakeholders\" and promised to keep 20% of the combined company's research and development jobs in the UK for five years. But Nurse said: \"Read has been nothing but evasive. There's nothing that hasn't been conditional. I haven't heard anything to make me believe he is prepared to make long-term commitments, and without those there is a risk they might just strip it.\" Nurse, whose predecessors at the Royal Society include Sir Christopher Wren and Sir Isaac Newton, said the merger could be beneficial for British research and the economy if Pfizer was really in it for the science rather than a quick buck: \"I could imagine it being quite a good deal if they are really serious about investing in the business \u2013 a business that is trying to make drugs to cure people.\" Looking relaxed in rolled-up shirt sleeves in his palatial Carlton House Terrace office, with sweeping views across St James's Park to Whitehall and the London Eye, Nurse added that combining Pfizer's \u00a340bn cash pile (which it has built up from overseas profits and wants to spend abroad rather than see it taxed in the US) with AstraZeneca's pipeline of potentially groundbreaking drugs could produce real benefits and open doors all over the world. \"If, on the other hand, they are doing it for short-term share price [gains] and to cut R&amp;D, it can't be good for anybody.\" Read was pressed on his pledges over jobs and research in a tense series of parliamentary hearings last week, when one MP reminded him that Pfizer had been likened by former AstraZeneca boss Sir David Barnes to a \"praying mantis\" that \"sucks the lifeblood out of their prey\". The Scottish-American Pfizer chief was forced to admit that, despite his promises, a merger would be followed by job losses and cuts to research spending. \"I'm not sitting here saying that we can become more efficient without some reduction in jobs,\" he said. Nurse, who is well known in Whitehall for campaigning to protect science spending, demanded a firm commitment from Read on the number of British jobs that would be secured \u2013 and for 10 years, not five. \"Drugs can take 20 years to develop,\" he said. \"If you come in offering five years, you're not really taking it seriously. It will take five years for a graduate student of mine to get a PhD.\" His warnings prompted MPs on the science and technology select committee to demand longer-term assurances from Pfizer, saying five years was inadequate in an industry that measures progress in decades rather than years. \"Science is a long-term enterprise and it requires a genuinely long-term commitment,\" committee chairman Andrew Miller said in a public letter to science minister David Willetts. \"We are not yet convinced that this is what Pfizer is offering. The government must be willing \u2013 and, crucially, able \u2013 to hold Pfizer to account if necessary.\" Nurse said politicians should also force Pfizer to commit \u00a3100m to a new fund to connect the company's research to universities and innovative small businesses: \"If they are serious, they wouldn't mind giving commitments.\" He pointed out that Pfizer had cut tens of thousands of jobs following previous takeovers, despite promises to the contrary, and closed most of its research lab in Sandwich, Kent, \u2013 site of the discovery of Viagra \u2013 just three years ago. The 65-year-old scientist conceded that it might be hard for Read to make firm offers before the company has submitted a formal bid. But he said: \"Read is saying he is unable to commit to research without looking at the books properly, but have they looked at the books enough to know what price to offer?\" Nurse said he would tell Read he should be made to commit to something far more legally binding, not just \"a piece of elastic\" about R&amp;D. \"If you are serious about R&amp;D, you would have no hesitation. You would tell your money men and your legal men, 'This is good for business. We'll tie ourselves into this.' They had the opportunity [to do so] in the last two select committees, but they certainly haven't reassured people like me.\" Nurse, who won a Nobel prize for a discovery crucial to the understanding of cancer in 2001 and heads the new \u00a3700m Francis Crick Institute, said he had the impression that money was the real motivation. He said pharmaceutical companies' constant worrying about short-term share price movements distracted them from their mission to create new medicines, which would be more beneficial to shareholders in the long run. \"Pharma is rapidly getting into a crisis,\" he went on. \"The only way forward it sees is to merge, merge, merge and buy discoveries from somebody because they're not doing it themselves.\" He said AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot appeared to be as driven by money as Read, adding that although the French-Australian boss had warned that lives could be put at risk by any delays the takeover might cause to drug development, he had also indicated he would recommend an offer if the price was high enough. \"They [AstraZeneca] say they have a fiduciary duty to shareholders, so if it's a lot of money \u2013 no matter what it means for the company \u2013 they will do it. If you were making chocolates or something maybe that is the way to run a business, but we're talking high-tech science. Understanding how humans work in life and disease is complicated.\" Nurse said Soriot, a fellow biologist by training, would find it hard not to let a potential \u00a331m personal share-option windfall influence his decision: \"I don't blame him. He would be saintly to turn it down, frankly.\"",

I think the government isn't happy either \u2026 and I don't think the scientific community is at all happy.\"</p> <p>Winning over the UK's scientists \u2013 particularly Nurse, widely regarded as the most influential \u2013 is vital if Pfizer is going to succeed in gaining public and political support for a takeover before a City deadline on 26 May.</p> <p>While it initially appeared that the government would not put any obstacles in the way of the proposed deal, the scale of the backlash from scientists has forced the prime minister and the chancellor to demand ever firmer assurances over British jobs and research. Vince Cable, the business secretary, refused to \"rule out intervention\", and shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna raised the stakes further by saying last week he would block the deal if Labour won next year's general election.</p> <p>Read has declared that the deal will be \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/10/pfizer-boss-calls-astrazeneca-takeover-proposal-a-win-win\" title=\"\">a win-win for society, a win-win for shareholders, and a win-win for stakeholders</a>\" and promised to keep 20% of the combined company's research and development jobs in the UK for five years.</p> <p>But Nurse said: \"Read has been nothing but evasive. There's nothing that hasn't been conditional. I haven't heard anything to make me believe he is prepared to make long-term commitments, and without those there is a risk they might just strip it.\"</p> <p>Nurse, whose predecessors at the Royal Society include Sir Christopher Wren and Sir Isaac Newton, said the merger could be beneficial for British research and the economy if Pfizer was really in it for the science rather than a quick buck: \"I could imagine it being quite a good deal if they are really serious about investing in the business \u2013 a business that is trying to make drugs to cure people.\"</p> <p>Looking relaxed in rolled-up shirt sleeves in his palatial Carlton House Terrace office, with sweeping views across St James's Park to Whitehall and the London Eye, Nurse added that combining Pfizer's \u00a340bn cash pile (which it has built up from overseas profits and wants <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/28/pfizer-astrazeneca-takeover-tax-benefits\" title=\"\">to spend abroad rather than see it taxed in the US</a>) with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/14/astrazeneca-cancer-drug-med14736-trials\" title=\"\">AstraZeneca's pipeline of potentially groundbreaking drugs</a> could produce real benefits and open doors all over the world. \"If, on the other hand, they are doing it for short-term share price [gains] and to cut R&amp;D, it can't be good for anybody.\"</p> <p>Read was pressed on his pledges over jobs and research in a tense series of parliamentary hearings last week, when one MP reminded him that Pfizer had been likened by former AstraZeneca boss Sir David Barnes to a \"praying mantis\" that \"sucks the lifeblood out of their prey\".</p> <p>The Scottish-American Pfizer chief was forced to admit that, despite his promises, a merger would be followed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/13/pfizer-astrazeneca-uk-job-cuts-mps-hostile\" title=\"\">job losses and cuts to research spending</a>. \"I'm not sitting here saying that we can become more efficient without some reduction in jobs,\" he said.</p> <p>Nurse, who is well known in Whitehall for campaigning to protect science spending, demanded a firm commitment from Read on the number of British jobs that would be secured \u2013 and for 10 years, not five. \"Drugs can take 20 years to develop,\" he said. \"If you come in offering five years, you're not really taking it seriously. It will take five years for a graduate student of mine to get a PhD.\"</p> <p>His warnings prompted MPs on the science and technology select committee to demand longer-term assurances from Pfizer, saying five years was inadequate in an industry that measures progress in decades rather than years.</p> <p>\"Science is a long-term enterprise and it requires a genuinely long-term commitment,\" committee chairman Andrew Miller said in a public letter to science minister David Willetts. \"We are not yet convinced that this is what Pfizer is offering. The government must be willing \u2013 and, crucially, able \u2013 to hold Pfizer to account if necessary.\"</p> <p>Nurse said politicians should also force Pfizer to commit \u00a3100m to a new fund to connect the company's research to universities and innovative small businesses: \"If they are serious, they wouldn't mind giving commitments.\"</p> <p>He pointed out that Pfizer had cut tens of thousands of jobs following previous takeovers, despite promises to the contrary, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/04/pfizer-astrazeneca-takeover-attempt-sandwich\" title=\"\">closed most of its research lab in Sandwich, Kent,</a> \u2013 site of the discovery of Viagra \u2013 just three years ago.</p> <p>The 65-year-old scientist conceded that it might be hard for Read to make firm offers before the company has submitted a formal bid. But he said: \"Read is saying he is unable to commit to research without looking at the books properly, but have they looked at the books enough to know what price to offer?\"</p> <p>Nurse said he would tell Read he should be made to commit to something far more legally binding, not just \"a piece of elastic\" about R&amp;D. \"If you are serious about R&amp;D, you would have no hesitation. You would tell your money men and your legal men, 'This is good for business. We'll tie ourselves into this.' They had the opportunity [to do so] in the last two select committees, but they certainly haven't reassured people like me.\"</p> <p>Nurse, who won a Nobel prize for a discovery crucial to the understanding of cancer in 2001 and heads the new \u00a3700m Francis Crick Institute, said he had the impression that money was the real motivation. He said pharmaceutical companies' constant worrying about short-term share price movements distracted them from their mission to create new medicines, which would be more beneficial to shareholders in the long run.</p> <p>\"Pharma is rapidly getting into a crisis,\" he went on. \"The only way forward it sees is to merge, merge, merge and buy discoveries from somebody because they're not doing it themselves.\"</p> <p>He said AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot appeared to be as driven by money as Read, adding that although the French-Australian boss had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/13/us-takeover-could-cost-lives-astrazeneca-boss-warns\" title=\"\">warned that lives could be put at risk by any delays the takeover might cause to drug development</a>, he had also indicated he would recommend an offer if the price was high enough. \"They [AstraZeneca] say they have a fiduciary duty to shareholders, so if it's a lot of money \u2013 no matter what it means for the company \u2013 they will do it. If you were making chocolates or something maybe that is the way to run a business, but we're talking high-tech science. Understanding how humans work in life and disease is complicated.\"</p> <p>Nurse said Soriot, a fellow biologist by training, would find it hard not to let a potential \u00a331m personal share-option windfall influence his decision: \"I don't blame him. He would be saintly to turn it down, frankly.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The saga of the \u00a363bn takeover bid for AstraZeneca by Pfizer took a fresh twist on Saturday as it emerged that ministers have opened talks in Brussels about strengthening the UK's ability to force the American firm to honour its commitments on jobs and research. The Observer has learned that exploratory talks have begun with EU officials over amending the terms of the British government's public interest test, which currently only allows ministers to block takeovers where there are concerns over national security, media plurality or competition. It has been mooted by UK ministers that the public interest test could be revised to include continued investment in research and design as grounds on which the government could threaten to block the takeover or, at least, seek stronger commitments from Pfizer than have so far been given. A source said: \"The public interest test does not have to be about blocking: it can be about securing legally binding commitments on research. Early exploratory talks in Brussels have begun about whether it is possible to write a commitment on research and design into the approval process, into the public interest test.\" Labour has been calling for business secretary Vince Cable to amend the criteria for a public interest test on sensitive takeovers, and will regard the development as a victory. Pfizer has said it will employ at least 20% of the new combined company's R&amp;D workforce in the UK but there are serious concerns within Whitehall that this promise is to apply for five years only. Ministers want to force Pfizer to commit to longer and to use a strengthened hand to secure such a guarantee. Should the takeover be completed, it would then be fall to the competition and markets authority to judge whether the government's public interest test was being met in the assurances made to the government. Pfizer made a \u00a363bn approach to AstraZeneca two weeks ago which was rejected but the US firm is preparing to come back with a higher offer that could value the Anglo-Swedish firm at up to \u00a367bn. It is unlikely that the deal could be completed within a year, allowing ministers time to secure agreement in Brussels for their plan to pass legislation to amend the public interest test. Labour has said they would vote in favour of such legislation. Last week Pfizer's chief executive, Ian Read, declared that the takeover deal would be a \"win-win for society\", despite concerns that the US firm's prime motivation is to reduce the company's tax liability by redomiciling in the UK. In an interview with the Observer, Sir Paul Nurse, the Nobel prize-winning scientist and president of the Royal Society, warns Pfizer: \"We don't trust you\". He adds: \"Read has been nothing but evasive. There's nothing that hasn't been conditional.

      "bodyText": "The Co-op's members voted unanimously on Saturday to accept a controversial plan to overhaul the 150-year-old organisation, which has been rocked by a series of crises. The decision to endorse reforms put forward by City grandee Paul Myners will be seen as a major victory for its executive directors. Spelling out the scale of the crisis facing the group, Richard Pennycook, the group's interim chief executive, pointed out that debt interest payments were now costing the organisation \u00a3100m a year. \"That's \u00a3100m we could not invest to make our food stores better,\" he said. \"\u00a3100m we could not share with our members. \u00a3100m sucked down in the City of London rather than staying in the communities where our members live and work.\" The Co-op group's chair, Ursula Lidbetter, said only stringent reforms would turn the group around. \"2013 was a disaster waiting to happen,\" she said. \"We had built it into our structure.\" But many Co-op members are deeply uncomfortable with plans that would replace the sprawling organisation's board \u2013 made up of 15 elected lay representatives from its regional boards, which represent its eight million members, and five drawn from its independent societies \u2013 with a smaller version. Under the Myners proposals, the new board would comprise an independent chair and six or seven non-executives plus two executives, all drawn from professional backgrounds. A separate body to handle members' concerns, which would be called the national membership council and have about 50 members, would hold the board to account and help choose who was elected to the new board. The Co-op's grassroots members fear the plans would severely curtail their ability to influence the board's thinking and would be inimical to the co-operative ethos. Such is the strength of their opposition that Myners resigned from the board in AprilMyners resigned from the Co-op board in April after his interim suggestions for reforming its corporate structure met fierce resistance. Myners was paid a nominal \u00a31 for his work but it is being claimed by well-placed sources within the group that the review cost the Co-op about \u00a35m in all, as the salaries and expenses of those involved spiralled. It was clear that many who voted in favour of the motion proposing the reforms, made at a special general meeting at the Co-op's Manchester HQ, did so in the belief that they had been drafted, to quote the group's respected former chief executive, Sir Graham Melmoth, with some degree of \"wriggle room\". Co-op members were also buoyed by comments from Lidbetter suggesting that the Myners recommendations would be up for discussion. Following a series of scandals, including the conviction of the Co-op bank's former chairman, the Rev Paul Flowers, on drugs charges and the resignation of the group's chief executive, Euan Sutherland, after details of his \u00a33.6m salary were leaked to the Observer, many felt the Myners plan was \"the only game in town\", as one put it. The organisation racked up losses of \u00a32.5bn last year and owes its lenders \u00a31.4bn. Lidbetter said: \"We may like to think that we control our business, but because of our level of debt, the banks have more say in what we can do than any of us here. How tragic a situation is that?\" Pennycook said the Co-op's tarnished reputation was having an impact on its trading. He pointed to a recent ICM poll that found one in four regular Co-op customers saying they would shop at its stores less as a result of the scandals. Speaking with Melmoth at a conference on the Co-op movement, held on Friday, Patrick Gray, president of Midcounties Co-operative, captured the conflicted mood of many members. \"It is a matter of the utmost urgency that the group lifts the very real threat from its creditors by paying down its debt, and provides the reassurance that its bankers demand, that in the nearest future it will be run by a board which is competent, cohesive and capable of taking business decisions in an informed and decisive manner.\" But Gray added: \"It is equally important that the group, as part of far-reaching reform, becomes substantially and democratically controlled by its members \u2013and so remains, in letter and in spirit, a genuine co-operative.\" Others, though, were furious that the 160 or so Co-op members eligible to vote at the meeting were going to back the motion. One member at the Friday conference talked of the \"madness of Myners\" and said: \"I can't believe we are supporting this.\" Melmoth, who has hinted that he may be brought out of retirement to help bridge the divide between members and the group board, appealed for pragmatism. \"We've got to batten down the hatches,\" he said. \"Phase 1: adopt the motion [backing Myners] with all of its faults. It's very peculiarly worded. It can mean what ever we want it to mean.\" Meg Hillier, a Labour MP with close links to the Co-op movement, agreed. She said that the vote \"was not the end but the beginning\" and suggested that history would look at the vote as the moment when the organisation turned a corner. But others were not so positive. Privately, many said that they believed the Co-op group board would now argue that it had a clear mandate to introduce the drastic changes proposed by Myners. The one thing both sides agree on, however, is that the Co-op's sorry saga is unlikely to be drawing to an end soon. One member predicted: \"If they look to force Myners through without substantial changes, there will be civil war.\"",

One member predicted: \"If they look to force Myners through without substantial changes, there will be civil war.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Co-operative Group members have unanimously voted in favour of overhauling the governance of the troubled 150-year-old British mutual. The decision at a special meeting in Manchester paves the way for a radical shakeup of the business after it suffered a \"catastrophic failure of governance\" and losses of \u00a32.5bn in 2013. The proposals by Lord Myners include replacing the Co-op's 20-strong board of representatives with a slimmed-down structure of professionally trained directors. Announcing the unanimous vote, the Co-operative Group chair, Ursula Lidbetter, said the business had \"let a great many people down and we owe them a considerable apology\". She said: \"Over the last year we have been a sorry sight for anyone who cares about cooperation. We have to accept the seriousness of the mistakes we've made.
