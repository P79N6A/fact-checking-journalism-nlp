Asked whether he would sell Homebase and focus solely on Argos, he said: \"It would be wrong of us not to think about getting rid of it, but there are synergies between the two that work together.\"",

      "bodyText": "The recovery \"is in sight\" and demand for UK exports is strong, according to the governor of the Bank of England Sir Mervyn King, in a boost to the chancellor ahead of next week's budget. King blamed the crisis in the eurozone, which accounts for almost 50% of exports, for the weakness of the UK's return to economic health, but said growth was now gaining momentum. Speaking in Birmingham as mortgage figures showed the housing market bounced back into life in January, King said: \"There is momentum behind the recovery that's coming, and I think that during the course of 2013 we will see the recovery come into sight.\" The upbeat tone of his comments will lift some of the gloom surrounding the debate over the economy in parliament, where both sides of the house have grown restless after four years of stagnant growth. George Osborne is braced for heavy criticism from his own backbenchers and opposition MPs concerned that his policies are allowing the economy to flatline. King said: \"If you just take away for the moment what happened in North Sea Oil production and in construction, the UK economy even last year grew by 1.5%.\" \"Two things are holding us back at the present. One is the extraordinary degree of weakness in the euro area. It's in recession, it's our single biggest trading partner. The economies in or close to the area really affect about half of our economy.\" The second factor is \"the enormous uncertainty generated by what is happening in the euro area is encouraging firms to hold back on investment\", he added. Mortgage lending to home-buyers registered its best start to the year since 2008, after lending in January was more than 10% higher than the same month a year ago. The rise, driven by a steady rise in buy-to-let activity and the return of first-time buyers, follows predictions earlier in the year from several of the big estate agency chains that activity was likely to pick up, though price growth would remain weak outside London and the south-east. New housebuilders have also signalled a steady rise in demand, which they credit in part to the government's \u00a380bn funding for lending scheme (FLS), which gives lenders access to cheap finance in order to help borrowers. Richard Sexton, director of e.surv chartered surveyors, said: \"Life is becoming easier for first-time buyers. Although deposit requirements are still high, rates are lower and banks are more willing to lend to lower-income borrowers.\" Last year the \u00a380bn failed to lift mortgage lending after two of the UK biggest banks - the state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds - withdrew more funds than they lent. But figures rushed out by the Bank of England appeared to show a turnaround in the scheme's fortunes in January following a steep rise in loans supplied by the main banks and building societies. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said 38,300 loans were advanced to home buyers in January worth \u00a35.7bn, marking an 11% year-on-year increase. The CML figures showed that despite a seasonal dip compared with December, These figures marked the strongest start to a year since 2008, when 47,800 loans were taken out. For the third month in a row, first-time buyers accounted for 42% of all house purchase loans, suggesting that recent improvements to the mortgage market are having an impact in helping people to get on the property ladder, the report said. A total of 15,900 loans worth \u00a32bn were advanced to first-time buyers, which is almost a quarter (24%) higher than a year ago and and also the largest January total since 2008. Experts said that the housing market has reached a \"crucial stage\" in its tentative recovery, which the government must encourage further in next week's Budget. Home buyers taking their first step on the property ladder still typically need to raise a 20% deposit, which is unchanged from a year ago. Most first time buyers benefit from a distribution of wealth from their parents who in many instances supply all or most of their deposit. CML director general Paul Smee said: \"Seasonal factors clearly had an impact on lending figures in January, but it still remains the best start to a year since 2008.\"",

David Blanchflower, a former MPC member and a critic of King's 10-year reign, said: \"This is about King defending his turf, preventing dissent and blocking transparency.\" Blanchflower, who now teaches economics at the Dartmouth College, an Ivy League research university in New Hampshire, said the governor, who will be replaced by Canadian Mark Carney when he retires in the summer, wanted to maintain control of the quarterly inflation report that guides the MPC's policies. The Stockton review of MPC forecasting warned that it had deteriorated since the financial crash and was worse than many independent forecasters. The bank was also accused of indulging in groupthink, which prevented debate and quashed ideas from lower-ranking staff. In response, Threadneedle Street said it agreed some procedures were opaque and there was a need for clear lines of responsibility, but said that criticisms of the MPC, which King chairs, were largely unfounded.",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has pledged to put Britain at the forefront of a new international seabed mining industry, which he claimed could be worth \u00a340bn to the UK economy over the next 30 years. But the prime minister has chosen an American defence company \u2013 Lockheed Martin \u2013 to spearhead the drive to collect from the depths of the ocean the copper, nickel and rare earth minerals used in mobile phones and solar panels. Russia and China also have licences to \"mine\" the ocean bed but Cameron said on Thursday: \"With our technology, skills, scientific and environmental expertise at the forefront, this demonstrates that the UK is open for business as we compete in the global race.\" Speaking at a launch at the Excel Centre in London's Docklands, he said talks were already under way with a potential supply chain of up to 100 British companies, even though the main activity will take place off the west coast of America. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has, in partnership with UK Seabed Resources \u2013 a newly formed subsidiary of Lockheed \u2013 obtained a licence and contract to explore a 58,000 sq km area of the Pacific Ocean for mineral-rich polymetallic \"nodules\". These rocky chunks, the size of a tennis ball, will eventually be scooped up using a seabed harvester and then broken up to release the minerals, if all goes to plan. Lockheed claims to have discovered riches in that particular area off the US coast after a bizarre hunt in the 1970s for a lost Russian submarine paid for by eccentric US billionaire Howard Hughes. The defence and aerospace group is keen to stress that its extraction measures are different from the deep-sea mining techniques that have been proposed by others and which have enraged environmentalists. It also argues that the nodules containing rare earth minerals found on the seabed have little of the uranium content that has also been a brake on terrestrial mining in places such as Greenland. \"Environmentally responsible collection of polymetallic nodules presents a complex engineering challenge but our team has the knowledge and experience to help position the UK at the forefront of this emerging industry,\" said Stephen Ball, the British-born chief executive of UK Seabed Resources and of Lockheed Martin UK (a company that is part of the managing consortium of the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston as well as being a key Ministry of Defence contractor.) The science minister, David Willetts, also present at the project launch, said the UK should benefit from already being a leader in underwater robotics and autonomous systems used in the development of North Sea oil and gas. Ball was more cautious than the prime minister about the potential to create thousands of jobs and bring in more than \u00a31bn a year from the industry, saying he was not too keen on \"aspirational promises\". And while he was keen that British companies should be engaged in future deepsea production, he said they would only be chosen if they were better than the competing foreign firms. Currently the licence obtained from the International Seabed Authority (ISA) gives the UK government and Lockheed the right to explore but not extract, so a second licence would be required for that. And before any mechanical harvester is built, there will have to be a thorough environmental study, which could begin this summer. The experience of the offshore wind industry has shown that even projects close to the coast of the UK have been driven by foreign companies using non-British suppliers. Exploration outside 200-mile territorial waters can only be undertaken through application for a licence from the ISA, established under the United Nations law of the sea convention.

One reason for Arm's share price strength has been the view that it will take market share from Intel in the server market which Intel currently dominates, but VMware's comments run contrary to this. Our view is that the size of the smartphone and tablet markets is significantly bigger than Arm's addressable market in servers and over 70% of Arms' royalties are from smartphones and tablets. Intel is beginning to take share here and the negative impact of any loss of share here will be significantly bigger than the impact of any gains in the server market. It is also worth keeping in mind that there was a lot of expectation in past years regarding Arm taking share from Intel in the Windows market for tablets and notebooks, but the launch of Windows RT on Arm has proved to be highly unsuccessful in the past five months. We believe Arm will see slowing revenues on the back of slowing sales of smartphones and losses of share to Intel. </blockquote> <p>Arm shares reversed an early fall to end 2.5p higher at 922.5p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> ended 47.91 points higher at 6529.41, a new five year high, helped by better than expected US weekly jobless claims, a day after positive American retail sales numbers.

But it is not downhill from here.</p> <p>But we cannot give up, we need to stay focused on the goal, the common goal. Our plan has four clear and consistent strands: <br>One: restoring financial stability \u2013 and maintaining it; <br>Two: ensuring sound public finances \u2013 structurally sound; <br>Three: fighting unemployment, especially for the young, today's emergency; <br>And four: working on long-term growth, preparing for the future.</p> <p>We need all four at the same time. The question is finding the right balance. We won't overcome a debt crisis with more debt. We won't create jobs if companies have no access <br>to credit.</p> <p>But neither will we bring back confidence and opportunities if our economies continue to shrink. It's not black and white. Nuances matter. As some might say, there are many <br>\"shades of grey\".</p> <p>So I am looking forward to our exchange and I am convinced we can find the best way forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full text is <a href=\"http://t.co/vtGu36FwgX\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5141fe3495cb3037f5c82709\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-03-14T16:43:32.805Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">What they said when they arrived</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a rundown of some of the comments from European leaders as they arrived for the two day summit:</p> <p><strong>UK prime minister David Cameron</strong>: <em>We need a European Union that does not over-regulate, but one that cuts regulations and that is what I am going to be pushing for at this council.</em></p> <p><strong>Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras:</strong> <em>Europe turns its focus to growth, which is the number one European problem today because the lack of growth creates unemployment and</em> especially youth unemployment.</p> <p><strong>German chancellor Angela Merkel:</strong> <em>It is expected there will be an emphasis on the fight against youth unemployment.

      "bodyText": "As the great leaders meet in Brussels, European markets have been in a positive mood, not least because another set of decent US numbers (jobless claims) has lifted Wall Street. \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished up 47.91 points at 6529.41, a 0.74% gain \u2022 Germany's Dax was up 1.1% \u2022 France's Cac climbed 0.93% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 2.45% higher \u2022 Spain's Ibex added 1.88% \u2022 There was an exception - the Athens market edged 0.5% In early trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 50 points. And with that, we're shutting up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow to wrap up all the summit developments. European Council president Herman Van Rompuy welcomed a return to relative stability but said there was much more to do. In his opening remarks to the spring council (and how cheery that seems compared to the bleak reality) he said: After three years of hard work to overcome the crisis, we've returned to relative stability, financial stability \u2013 and that is the precondition for all the rest. But these results are not yet translating into stronger growth and more jobs. That's what hurts people now, that's where our focus must be. We are engaged in a long distance race. We've already made huge progress, climbed hills \u2013 even mountains! \u2013, which before seemed insurmountable. Yes, we are closer to the finishing line than to the starting line. But it is not downhill from here. But we cannot give up, we need to stay focused on the goal, the common goal. Our plan has four clear and consistent strands: One: restoring financial stability \u2013 and maintaining it; Two: ensuring sound public finances \u2013 structurally sound; Three: fighting unemployment, especially for the young, today's emergency; And four: working on long-term growth, preparing for the future. We need all four at the same time. The question is finding the right balance. We won't overcome a debt crisis with more debt. We won't create jobs if companies have no access to credit. But neither will we bring back confidence and opportunities if our economies continue to shrink. It's not black and white. Nuances matter. As some might say, there are many \"shades of grey\". So I am looking forward to our exchange and I am convinced we can find the best way forward. The full text is here. Here's a rundown of some of the comments from European leaders as they arrived for the two day summit: UK prime minister David Cameron: We need a European Union that does not over-regulate, but one that cuts regulations and that is what I am going to be pushing for at this council. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras: Europe turns its focus to growth, which is the number one European problem today because the lack of growth creates unemployment and especially youth unemployment. German chancellor Angela Merkel: It is expected there will be an emphasis on the fight against youth unemployment. We have decided on a growth pact in the summer of last year, and now this growth pact has to be filled with life. Cyprus president Nicos Anastasiades: I do hope that by tomorrow we can negotiate and find a solution [on a bailout]. European Council president Herman Van Rompuy: There is still a long way to go to restore our growth prospects, to revive our economies, to heal our banking systems, to create more jobs and to improve welfare across our union. EU commissioner Olli Rehn: There is no real contradiction between sustainable growth and the sustainability of public finances. Finnish prime minister Jyrki Katainen: The division of labour is clear: the EU sets the goals, monitors and provides guidance. The member states are responsible for the implementation. Until the confidence in the member states' commitment is restored, it will be very difficult to get out of this crisis. (Quotes courtesy Reuters) Ahead of tomorrow's meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Cyprus, Reuters has put together a factbox here about what any bailout might entail. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban has dismissed concerns that changes made to his country's constitution are undemocratic. The EU, US and human rights groups have criticised the reforms, saying they could limit the power of Hungary's top court and undermine democracy. But ahead of the EU summit, Orban said: Who is able to present even one single point of evidence, facts may I say, which could be the basis for any argument that what we are doing is against democracy? Without facts there is no sense of any general political discussion. (Quote from Reuters) More on Italy, and it's another vote of confidence, of sorts. Luxembourg president and ex-Eurogroup head Jean-Claude Juncker says the country may not need to tap the rescue mechanisms. But it's not all positive. He also said he had great concerns about the economic trends in Europe. And he talked of \"social rebellion\" if jobs and growth were not addressed. Surely we've seen some of that already, in protests across the eurozone and in the Italian elections? Meanwhile as Mario Monti arrives in Brussels for his last summit, another former Italian prime minister could also be on the move: And with that I'm going to hand you over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. The European Central Bank should be ready to pull make good on its promise to buy government bonds of crisis-hit countries, if certain conditions are fulfilled, an ECB governing council member said today. Klaas Knot said: I don't want to speculate on any specific case. But it is clear that if certain circumstances are fulfilled, then the ECB should be ready for activation. Another ECB governing council member Panicos Demetriades told Reuters earlier today that Ireland's issuance of its first long-term bond since the bailout was an important step towards qualifying for help from the programme. IMF chief Christine Lagarde will take part in the Eurogroup meeeting of eurozone finance ministers tomorrow (see 8.55am), according to a Reuters headline. This is particularly interesting as the IMF is keen to push its line on Cyprus, that depositors in Cypriot banks should bear some of the cost of any bailout. (see 8.56am) Meanwhile, the protestors outside are growing in number, despite the snow. Reuters estimates that around 10,000 people took part in a demonstration on outside the EC headquarters on the first day of the EU summit. Here come the pictures of the leaders arriving for the EU summit. A pick of the best... While Germany might be keen to push the austerity line at the EU summit, it seems the draft conclusions, at least, appear to be very focused on growth. The stagnation of economic activity forecast for 2013 and the unacceptably high levels of unemployment emphasise how crucial it is to accelerate efforts to support growth as a matter of priority. Particular priority must be given to supporting youth employment and promoting growth and competitiveness. The German finance minister is now speaking. Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble says he is very confident Italy will build a government capable of acting. He says Italy under prime minister Mario Monti has made great progress. He also says there is no reason to be depressed on the economic outlook. Then he comes out with the (now rather predictable line) that the \"crisis is not over\". Over in Greece, hundreds of students have been blocking up the education ministry today to protest against the shake-up of the university system. The Greek government plans to reduce the number of higher education departments in the new academic year, in a bid to save funds as the country grapples with its worst financial crisis in decades. And so it begins. Italian prime minister Mario Monti has said he will ask his EU partners to grant Italy more flexibility in its budget deficit objectives to help efforts to boost its stagnant economy. Speaking on the way into the EU summit, he said: Reasonable margins for flexilbility have been introduced and we will ask to be able to avail ourselves of these margins. Another positive sign for the US employment market has come with better than expected jobless claims figures. Weekly initial claims unexpectedly fell 10,000 to 332,000, the third straight week of declines. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise to around 350,000. Quick look at the markets, which are buoyant, after cheery US retail sales figures out yesterday drove optimism that the global economic outlook is improving. (Clearly traders have chosen to ignore the rather more pessimistic data out of Europe today). UK FTSE 100: up 0.35%, or 23 points, at 6505 France CAC 40: up 0.54% Germany DAX: up 0.69% Spain IBEX: up 1.33% Italy FTSE MIB: up 1.35% Here's a picture of the vast banner protestors have erected outside the EC headquarters, for the two-day European summit that starts today. Eurozone employment numbers (see 10.40am) are \"disappointing and worrying\" says Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight. While Eurozone economic activity seemed to bottom out last October and business confidence has trended up in recent months, neither appears strong enough to prevent further rises in Eurozone unemployment for some time to come - although the situation will vary markedly between countries. Meanwhile, the increased drop in Eurozone employment in the fourth quarter of 2012 maintains belief that consumer spending will remain generally muted in the near term at least, especially as consumers are also facing muted wage growth and tighter fiscal policy in many countries. The troika \u2013 of the EU, the ECB and the IMF \u2013 leave Greece today without a resolution over civil service job cuts. After extending their trip by several days, Greece's international lenders said they would return to the country in April to finish their review. The troika said in a statement that Greece was making significant progress in reforms required to receive the next tranche of emergency loans, but some issues remain and Athens needs time to complete the work. ekathimerini reports: Talks between Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and troika officials lasted for a couple of hours on Wednesday night but no conclusion was reached on matters including the reduction of civil servant numbers and a payment plan for firms and individuals who owe social security contributions. Despite the apparent impasse in the discussions, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras insisted that the two sides were edging toward a deal and that Greece\u2019s next loan tranche of \u20ac2.8bn was not in danger. Eurozone employment, meanwhile, dropped by 0.3% in the fourth quarter compared with the third, as the stagnant economy failed to generate new jobs despite the Christmas shopping season. Of the eurozone's major economies, only Germany managed an increase in employment, while the job rate in Spain dropped 1.4%. Marie Diron of accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young offered this gloomy assessment of the European jobs market: A further rise in unemployment int he short term, and only a slow decline from 2014 is likely to be an impediment to growth. Even with recovery, the number of people out of work across Europe will remain stubbornly high. By the end of 2017, we estimate the unemployment rate will remain above 11%. Meanwhile, the ECB's confidence of a turnaround this year (see 9.47am) looks a little misplaced in the light of Greek jobless figures out this morning. Unemployment in Greece hit 26% in the fourth quarter of last year, up from 24.8% in the third. The highest unemployment rate is recorded among people aged between 15 and 24, at 57.8%. There are also deeply worrying figures on long-term unemployment. The statistics agency Elstat said the percentage of people that have been looking for a job for more than one year has reached 65.3%. Spain's borrowing costs have come down again at a special debt auction. The country sold \u20ac803m of longer-dated debt, with healthy demand for the government bonds on offer. The Treasury sold \u20ac134m of 2029 bonds at a yield of 5.22%, compared with 5.78% at the last sale in February. Yields were 5.434% and 5.432% respectively on the 2040 and 2041 bonds, lower than at the previous sales. Lyn Graham-Taylor at Rabobank said: It looks like a decent set of auction results. Much lower yields than when these bonds were last auctioned, which is not surprising given the continued compression of Spanish yields. The size was roughly as anticipated and obviously it was always going to go well given that it looks like this was a request from primary dealers, a reverse inquiry and to an extent a chance for the Tesoro to dip their toe at the longer end again. In the secondary market, the yields on Spanish 10-year debt are still ahead of Italy's but only just. Bond investors are growing increasingly nervous about the political deadlock in Italy and so are selling bonds, driving prices down and yields higher. Meanwhile, Spain's fortunes are seen to be improving. The yield \u2013 effectively the interest rate \u2013 on Spanish 10-year debt is currently at 4.853%. The yield on Italian 10-year debt is 4.682%. For further explanation of how the bond market works, see our eurozone crisis glossary. The European Central Bank does not need to change interest rates at this stage, ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny said this morning, despite recent exhortations from the IMF that it should do exactly that. Nowotny said that growth momentum in the eurozone was set to pick up this year and that the bank needed to wait to see the positive impact of structural reforms. President [Mario] Draghi has said that while we have generally unsatisfactory economic developments in Europe now we assume that growth forces will improve in the course of 2013. So this is why we are watching developments. It would not be appropriate to take interest rate policy steps. Massive improvements have begun here. One has to give the improvements time to take effect. The ECB said in its monthly bulletin that the eurozone is expected to recover gradually later this year, although that could be hampered if governments fail to implement structural reforms. Sticking with Spain, the European Court of Justice has today ruled that the country's mortgage laws are \"abusive\" and \"illegal\". (Thanks to DonJuan for flagging this up in the comments below.) At present, banks can demand full payment for the outstanding mortgage if a homeowner fails to pay just one monthly installment. This has resulted in a wave of people losing their homes. The Christian Science Monitor reports: Eviction proceedings have soared since 2007 to some 450,000, according to the most recent court data, although that includes all types of properties. The number of those ending in evictions increased by nearly 135 percent in 2012 from the year before, pointing toward worsening trends. El Pais reports this morning that the European court ruling will be directly applicable from today and in current lawsuits. [Typo corrected - thank you for flagging it up.] [Clarification: Sorry it was not very clear before.] Spanish retail sales dropped 10.2% in the year to January. The Spanish statistics office says this is adjusted for \"calendar and seasonal effects\", i.e. each month's statistics will take into account seasonal effects and the differing number of working days from year to year. That compares with expectations of an 11.1% decline, and an annual decline of 11.4% in December (revised down from -10.7%). Spain's annual retail sales figures have shown a decline for the past 31 months. However, in January, they ticked up by 0.9% compared with the previous month. Over to Spain, which is looking to cash in on a recent rally in its bonds with an unscheduled debt auction today. It is likely to sell \u20ac1bn-\u20ac2bn of debt and we should get the results through in about half an hour. Watch this space. This Eurogroup meeting (see 8.55am) will be the first time all 17 finance ministers debate the subject and deep divisions remain over how to manage a bailout of the tiny island. Peter Spiegel of the FT reports: Differences continue to centre on how fast Cyprus should get its debt down to a manageable level. Without a cut in the \u20ac17bn cost, Cypriot sovereign debt will reach 145 per cent of gross domestic product, by far the highest in the eurozone except for Greece. Advocates of a more radical plan \u2013 which would include a big restructuring of the crippled Cypriot banking sector, which needs about \u20ac10bn in new capital \u2013 want Nicosia\u2019s sovereign debt cut to 100 per cent of GDP by 2016, the end of the three-year bailout. Others are urging a more gradual path, which would get Cyprus to 100 per cent by 2020. The International Monetary Fund has been leading the charge for tougher action and has received strong backing from a German-led group of northern eurozone countries. Part of the IMF plan is to force losses on depositors in Cypriot banks to finance the \u20ac10bn bank rescue. This is seen as popular in countries (such as Germany), which are concerned Cypriot banks are nests for Russian mobsters to launder their money. But the EC and the Cypriot government are worried it would spark bank runs in Cyprus, which could spread to the likes of Spain. As debt guru Lee Buchheit noted, the way policymakers handle the Cyprus bailout is crucial to the next stage of the crisis. He told me: The world will watch what they do in Cyprus and view it as an expression of their current thinking. In one sense, the fact that Cyprus is small arguably allows them to experiment a bit more. But the world will watch it and see Spain. More of that interview here. Meanwhile, German finance minister Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble was very clear that a bailout of Cyprus was not on the agenda for the summit. Some would like that this question will be discussed at the EU summit. This is not on the agenda of the EU summit and also not its responsibility. A German official did, however, admit that it was likely to be discussed on the sidelines. Separately, the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers will meet on Friday to discuss the thorny issue of a bailout for the tiny island, as announced by the group's new head on Twitter. [Correction: Apologies, Friday is definitely tomorrow, not today] Germany, meanwhile, is starting to look like the smug man of Europe, with claims that its finances are the \"envy of the world\". Europe's largest economy yesterday revealed budget plans that show net new borrowing falling to \u20ac6.4bn next year, while the structural deficit will drop to zero. Economy minister Philipp Roesler said: With all modesty, this is a result of historic proportions. The lesson from the sovereign debt crisis is that solid finances are essential. Thanks to this approach Germany is in the vanguard in Europe. Our success with a policy of growth-oriented consolidation is the envy of the world. (One can only imagine what he would have said if he weren't being modest.) It is thought the plans were rushed through ahead of the EU summit, so Germany could lead by example. The FT reports: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, German finance minister, said on Wednesday that his budget for 2014, involving spending cuts of more than \u20ac5bn to trim the total below \u20ac300bn, was \u201ca strong signal for Europe\u201d. He described the 2014 spending plan as \u201cgrowth-friendly consolidation\u201d, intended to prove to the rest of the eurozone that \u201cconsistent sustainable budgeting and growth are not mutually exclusive\u201d. It is thought that there is already some disagreement over how much to emphasize austerity in the final conclusions of the summit. FT reporters write: According to a draft seen by the Financial Times, the conclusions call for \u201cshort-term targeted measures to boost growth and jobs\u201d \u2013 a line that has come under criticism from a German-led group of northern eurozone countries. All in all, today's summit is likely to see some lively debate. The summit is also likely to reveal the growing tensions between Germany and France, the eurozone's two largest economies. French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said earlier this week that he would not be able to cut the public deficit to the EU limit of 3% of GDP this year, and that it was more likely to come in at 3.7%, as a result of the country's troubled economy. German finance minister Wolfgang Scha\u00fcble, however, has since said that he was \"sure that France would, like us, respect the rules\" on the public deficit. With unemployment across the eurozone at record highs and Italy still reeling from the anti-austerity vote at its recent elections, EU politicians will be keen to show they are focussing on growth and not just belt-tightening. One EU official told AP: If there is no growth for 10 years then you can't pay back your debt ... there is not much room for manoeuvre. As is the way with these things, a draft of the summit conclusions is already circulating. AP reports: [The draft] says that with no upturn this year and \"unacceptably high levels of unemployment\", it is critical to support growth \"as a matter of priority\". Stabilising public finances must be done through \"growth-friendly fiscal consolidation\", it adds. \"Hiding in this language is the idea that you can stretch the time (to meet deficit targets) a bit ... while those in a stronger position can increase expenditure,\" another EU official said. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone debt crisis and other global economic events. EU leaders gather in Brussels today for a two-day summit in an attempt to negotiate the difficult balance between austerity and growth. Already, the protestors are gathering and have strung huge banners outside the EU headquarters proclaiming \"Austerity Pact, No! Solidarity Pact, Yes!\" (We'll try and get pictures of that, as soon as we can.) Eurozone finance ministers, meanwhile, will meet tonight after the summit closes to discuss a Cyprus bailout. We'll have all the news on that and other economic developments around the world as the day goes on.",

      "bodyText": "David Cameron has been rightly hammered for last week's big speech on the economy, by his own Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) for misrepresenting its position on cuts and growth and by assorted economic grown-ups for a wider misunderstanding of the damage his government's strategy is doing to Britain's fragile-to-negative recovery. But it's worse than that. Liam Fox, one of several Tories making \"look at me\" noises as Cameron's government hits choppy waters (yes, we know you're there too, Theresa), made a speech too last week. It didn't get as much coverage, rightly so, though the unstoppable Andrew Sparrow provided the bullet points on his daily blog here. The full text is (oddly?) here in the New Statesman and the Guardian's summary is here. What Fox says doesn't matter in itself. As I never tire of explaining he's damaged goods, his chance of becoming the post-Dave Tory leader are slightly less than mine, unless the party is defeated in 2015 \u2013 by no means clear \u2013 and decides to wander off into the wilderness as it did under William Hague after John Major was defeated in 1997 by the man we mustn't mention.

    "webTitle": "Private equity crash could trigger next wave of financial crisis, Bank warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England warned on Thursday that the next phase of the UK's six-year financial and economic crisis may be triggered by the collapse of debt-laden companies bought by private equity firms in the boom years before the crash. In its latest quarterly bulletin, Threadneedle Street said the need over the next year to refinance firms subject to heavily leveraged buyouts posed a systemic threat. The Bank added that it would use its new role as the watchdog of the City to monitor private equity deals in future \"episodes of exuberance\" to prevent a repeat of the debt-driven takeover boom in the run-up to the banking crisis. \"In the mid-2000s, there was a dramatic increase in acquisitions of UK companies by private equity funds,\" the Bank said. \"Many of these buyouts, especially the larger ones, were highly leveraged and the increased indebtedness of such companies poses a risk to the stability of the financial system \u2013 a risk that is compounded by the need for companies to refinance debt maturing over the next few years in an environment of much tighter credit conditions.\" Noting that there had been a surge of private equity deals in the first six years of the last decade, the Bank said a feature of the investments had been the use of debt. Buyouts were typically financed by money borrowed from banks, with the debt becoming the liability of the purchased company. There was evidence, it said, that private equity companies had been particular beneficiaries of \"forbearance\" by commercial banks \u2013 the tendency of lenders to go easy on borrowers for fear that they might go bust. But it said a refinancing challenge was looming in 2014, because the peak in debt issuance was in 2007 and the average maturity of leveraged buyout debt is seven years. Deals became bigger and bigger as the decade wore on, and this trend coincided with a loosening of credit conditions by banks, which made debt finance even more attractive as they vied for business. The study cited the case of Royal Bank of Scotland, now 83% owned by the taxpayer after being rescued from collapse by the Treasury in October 2008. An aggressive expansion into leveraged finance was an important factor in RBS's credit losses, Threadneedle Street said. Owners of private equity companies say the buyouts help to make companies more efficient by spurring management to provide regular interest payments on the debt. But the Bank said there were also potential downsides to private equity, including the risk that the pressure for short-term returns would starve companies of long-term investment. \"A consequence of the increased use of debt financing on buyouts in the mid-2000s was that debt to earnings ratios, in particular on deals in excess of \u00a3100m, climbed to persistently high levels. \"One risk to the UK financial system from these debt levels is the heightened fragility of the corporate sector. Specifically, higher debt levels could make companies less likely to undertake long-term investment if that investment is crowded out by the costs of servicing debt.\" In a separate article in the bulletin, the Bank said it would expect to make a profit on the purchase of gilts under the \u00a3375bn quantitative easing programme unless the announcement that the scheme was to be reversed triggered a big rise in long-term interest rates. The Bank has been making money on its gilt purchases since QE began in early 2009 because the price of government bonds has risen. When the time comes for QE to be reversed, the Bank expects the fall in bond prices to push up yields \u2013 a measure of the cost of borrowing \u2013 on gilts. Work by the Bank's economists has shown that the state would still make a small profit on QE if yields on 10-year gilts rose from 2% to 5% but there would be a \u00a35bn loss if they increased to 6%.",
