      "body": "<p>SuperGroup, the company behind the Superdry fashion brand, has sought to draw a line under a turbulent year as it reported a 13% rise in first half profits.</p> <p>Shares in the retailer, whose celebrity fans include Pippa Middleton and the singer Ed Sheeran, have more than doubled over the past six months as the management has clawed back its credibility after a series of profit warnings and mistakes \u2013 including a misfiring IT system and accounting errors \u2013 that weighed heavily on the company's value.</p> <p>\"We are better organised than we were a year ago, and I am feeling as positive as a retailer can feel, given the current economic conditions,\" said its co-founder and chief executive Julian Dunkerton, before the busiest sales weeks of the year. \"If you go into any shopping mall and look how busy we are compared to other people \u2026 I think you will realise that we are on track.\"</p> <p>SuperGroup made an underlying pre-tax profit of \u00a314.7m in the six months to 28 October which was in line with analysts' expectations and up from \u00a313m made in the same period last year. The retailer said sales of its trademark T-shirts, hooded tops, checked shirts and jogging bottoms rose 16.2% to \u00a3158.2m, as the firm reaped the benefits of an expanded product range, which includes more knitwear and denim styles, as well as behind-the-scenes improvements.

      "bodyText": "SuperGroup, the company behind the Superdry fashion brand, has sought to draw a line under a turbulent year as it reported a 13% rise in first half profits. Shares in the retailer, whose celebrity fans include Pippa Middleton and the singer Ed Sheeran, have more than doubled over the past six months as the management has clawed back its credibility after a series of profit warnings and mistakes \u2013 including a misfiring IT system and accounting errors \u2013 that weighed heavily on the company's value. \"We are better organised than we were a year ago, and I am feeling as positive as a retailer can feel, given the current economic conditions,\" said its co-founder and chief executive Julian Dunkerton, before the busiest sales weeks of the year. \"If you go into any shopping mall and look how busy we are compared to other people \u2026 I think you will realise that we are on track.\" SuperGroup made an underlying pre-tax profit of \u00a314.7m in the six months to 28 October which was in line with analysts' expectations and up from \u00a313m made in the same period last year. The retailer said sales of its trademark T-shirts, hooded tops, checked shirts and jogging bottoms rose 16.2% to \u00a3158.2m, as the firm reaped the benefits of an expanded product range, which includes more knitwear and denim styles, as well as behind-the-scenes improvements. UK like-for-like sales were up 3.9%, while wholesale orders increased nearly 8%. Some analysts worry that the Superdry brand is losing its cachet in the trend-conscious youth market but Dunkerton batted the concerns away: \"The most important thing is does your product progress?

It has also been taken to court over allegations of exploiting warehouse workers in outsourced parts of its American supply chain.</p> <p>But Duke said the company saw no link between its huge profits \u2013 relentlessly eked out against razor-thin margins in the tough retail sector \u2013 and the various protests and problems that have marked the year. \"I don't spend much time thinking of the tensions,\" Duke said. \"This tension from some of the recent protests \u2026 for me, it is not a tension,\" he added.</p> <p>In a relentlessly cheerful speech to a packed room of luminaries at the council's Upper East Side headquarters in Manhattan, Duke said he regularly visited ordinary Walmart workers as a way of bolstering his mood. \"If you are feeling down in the dumps, go out in the stores and visit our associates,\" he said.</p> <p>Duke insisted that Walmart, which is the world's largest private firm with 2.4 million employees, offered a chance of a better life to those who took jobs there. \"We pay competitive wages with outstanding benefits,\" he said. \"Our jobs become great opportunities for the future.\"</p> <p>That opinion is contested by the groups, such as Our Walmart, which has been seeking to protest against what they say are low wages at the firm. The group last month organised a nationwide series of strikes and walkouts to mark Black Friday, the busiest single shopping day in America.</p> <p>The group contends that many Walmart workers earn barely over minimum wage, and are often assigned too few hours to get by or qualify for proper health benefits. The day of action saw Our Walmart hold actions at some 1,000 stores, earning headlines across the country.</p> <p>Duke joked that he welcomed the protests, including those happening outside the Council's offices as he spoke. \"Isn't it wonderful that we can live in a country and be here in this great city and express different points of view?\" he said.</p> <p>But he was less dismissive over the allegations of overseas corruption and the aftermath of the Bangladesh fire. While insisting that corporate responsibility was \"part of our DNA\" at Walmart, he admitted the firm took allegations of bribery in Mexico, India, China and Brazil \"seriously\". The firm is investigating the issue, which may break a US federal anti-corruption law called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \"We will take the appropriate action upon conclusion of this investigation,\" he said.</p> <p>Duke also addressed the fire at the Tazreen Fashions Ltd plant in Bangladesh that killed 112 people last month. The plant had been \"de-authorised\" by Walmart and was not supposed to supply clothes to the giant firm, he said.</p> <p>However, documents uncovered by labour activists, and reported by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, have shown that Tazreen was still making clothes for two different Walmart suppliers just a few weeks before the deadly blaze.</p> <p>Separately, Bloomberg News has reported that at a garment industry meeting in Bangladesh in April 2011, a regional Walmart executive said the firm would not share the expense of safety improvements to local factories, including fire safety issues, as the price would be too high.</p> <p>However, in New York, Duke said the firm did not make a judgment call between profit and safety. When asked if the firm would pay its suppliers more and thus make it easier for them to afford safety standards, he said: \"There is no conflict. We will not back an unsafe factory. This is not a price discussion,\" he said.</p> <p>That comment was unlikely to satisfy some of the protesters on the streets outside the council, some of whom had come to specifically demonstrate about the Bangladesh disaster.</p> <p>Kazi Fauzia, who works with low wage group DRUM, said she saw Duke as a hypocrite whose supply chain exploited low wage workers in Bangladesh with little regard for their pay or their safety.</p> <p>\"This is not just. Walmart should pay higher wages and they have to do more on fire safety,\" she said. Other protesters were more blunt. A group of left-wing labour protesters chanted: \"Mike Duke! You make us puke!\" as they marched on the pavement outside the building. Meanwhile, across the other side of the street a group of several dozen animals rights demonstrators held up pictures of animals with anti-Walmart slogans on them.</p>",

The firm is investigating the issue, which may break a US federal anti-corruption law called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \"We will take the appropriate action upon conclusion of this investigation,\" he said. Duke also addressed the fire at the Tazreen Fashions Ltd plant in Bangladesh that killed 112 people last month. The plant had been \"de-authorised\" by Walmart and was not supposed to supply clothes to the giant firm, he said. However, documents uncovered by labour activists, and reported by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, have shown that Tazreen was still making clothes for two different Walmart suppliers just a few weeks before the deadly blaze. Separately, Bloomberg News has reported that at a garment industry meeting in Bangladesh in April 2011, a regional Walmart executive said the firm would not share the expense of safety improvements to local factories, including fire safety issues, as the price would be too high. However, in New York, Duke said the firm did not make a judgment call between profit and safety. When asked if the firm would pay its suppliers more and thus make it easier for them to afford safety standards, he said: \"There is no conflict. We will not back an unsafe factory. This is not a price discussion,\" he said. That comment was unlikely to satisfy some of the protesters on the streets outside the council, some of whom had come to specifically demonstrate about the Bangladesh disaster. Kazi Fauzia, who works with low wage group DRUM, said she saw Duke as a hypocrite whose supply chain exploited low wage workers in Bangladesh with little regard for their pay or their safety. \"This is not just. Walmart should pay higher wages and they have to do more on fire safety,\" she said. Other protesters were more blunt. A group of left-wing labour protesters chanted: \"Mike Duke! You make us puke!\" as they marched on the pavement outside the building. Meanwhile, across the other side of the street a group of several dozen animals rights demonstrators held up pictures of animals with anti-Walmart slogans on them.",

      "bodyText": "The former chief City watchdog is joining Barclays bank in a newly created role to overhaul the bank's compliance procedures following the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal and to rebuild its battered relationship with financial regulators. Hector Sants will join the bank in January as head of compliance, government and regulatory relations after six months' gardening leave from the Financial Services Authority. He will be responsible for the embattled bank's relationship with regulators and a department staffed by 1,300 compliance officers. Despite his seniority in the past, Sants will not have a seat on the board. Salary details have not been revealed. He is joining a bank that his successor at the FSA, Andrew Bailey, said had a \"culture of gaming\". Sants left the FSA in June days before the announcement of the \u00a3290m fine for Libor rigging that led Barclays' chairman Marcus Agius, chief executive Bob Diamond and chief operating officer Jerry del Missier to leave. His appointment to Barclays \u2013 the subject of speculation for the past week \u2013 has been approved by the FSA, which he joined in 2004 after a career as an investment banker before being promoted to chief executive in the summer of 2007, just as the credit crunch was taking hold. Sants, who was not involved in setting the level of the Libor fine against Barclays, ended up becoming embroiled in the scandal and had to explain to MPs the events that led to the regulator's approving Diamond's promotion to chief executive two years ago. He wrote to the Treasury select committee, which took evidence from Diamond and others, to say he told Barclays \"the relationship with [Diamond] had not reached the level of openness, transparency and willingness to air issues\" that the regulator had had with his predecessor, John Varley. In his new role at Barclays, Sants will not become involved in any of the current FSA investigations such as into the mis-selling of payment protection insurance and interest rate swaps or the inquiry involving finance director Chris Lucas and others into the information disclosed to the market during its life-saving fund-raising with Middle Eastern investors in 2008. Stephen Gilchrist, head of City legal firm Saunders Law, said: \"Appointing Hector Sants as head of compliance is a bit like Mary Queen of Scots appointing her executioner to represent her best interests. Talk about gamekeeper turned poacher.\" Privately some questioned how Sants had been able to join a bank so quickly after leaving the FSA. Had he stayed at the watchdog he would have ended up running the new prudential regulation authority, to be set up inside the Bank of England next year, but some MPs had questioned whether he should have joined the new regulator. He had first announced his intention to leave the FSA in February 2010 but by June 2010 George Osborne convinced him to stay on to see through the coalition's break up of the FSA. Sants, who received a salary at the FSA of \u00a3500,000, will report to Antony Jenkins, the internal candidate who succeeded Diamond in September and who is under pressure to produce his plan to change the culture at Barclays. The bank said Sants' appointment would mean that for the first time \"all compliance staff within the bank report to one individual, and operate independently of business and regional management teams\". Jenkins said: \"Our people always acting in the right way in all of our interactions will be central to our culture \u2013 simply how we do business \u2013 but it is important to bolster that with the second line of defence provided by controls and a world class compliance function.\" Sants had always said he hoped to take on another job. \"Taking on the responsibility of leading Barclays' global compliance function, and overseeing the bank's relationships with governments and regulators, gives me that opportunity,\" Sants said.",

      "bodyText": "It is almost a decade since the late Sir Derek Higgs provided a list of solutions to counter the \"pale male\" dominance of the boardrooms of the UK's biggest companies. One of them involved commissioning Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former advisor to Bill Clinton and one time dean of the London Business School, to draw up a list of 100 people from outside the corporate sector who might make suitable candidates for non-executive roles at big companies. Higgs wanted Tyson to produce a list \"that will be long enough to stop [the media] poking all over the names but short enough not be a telephone directory\". After toiling for several months Tyson decided that she preferred not to name any names at all. Instead she opined that there were plenty of good, diverse candidates available if only companies took the trouble to look \u2013 and the project fell by the wayside. Almost 10 years later and a list is now available, not just of 100 names but of more than 8,000 women ready, able and qualified to take seats on boards around the world. Known as the \"global board-ready women\" database, it has been created by the European Business Schools/Women on Boards Taskforce, aided by LinkedIn and the Financial Times non-executive directors club.

    "webTitle": "UK unemployment falls as private sector jobs hit all-time high", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Unemployment in Britain recorded its sharpest quarterly drop in more than a decade in the late summer and early autumn as strong jobs growth by private companies more than offset labour shedding in the public sector. Despite signs that the economy has failed to maintain its rapid pace of growth in the summer, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the number of joblessfell by 86,000 to 2.51 million in the three months to October. But with the latest official data again showing that earnings had failed to keep pace with inflation, the Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said workers were much worse off than they were before the financial crisis began five years ago. The ONS reported that employment was 499,000 higher in the three months to October 2012 than it had been in the same period a year earlier to stand at 29.6 million \u2013 its highest ever level. But the ONS said average earnings excluding bonuses were rising at an annual rate of 1.7% \u2013 well below the current inflation rate of 2.7%. Dale said the UK was still adjusting to the post-crisis world and singled out the hefty fall in productivity that has seen employment rise but output stagnate. \"The harsh but inescapable reality of these developments \u2013 and the real adjustments they necessitate \u2013 is that households and families in our economy are worse off. Much worse off,\" Dale said. Speaking in London, he praised the labour market's \"extraordinary flexiblity\", but noted that the pay packet of the average worker bought 15% less than it did in the pre-crisis period. \"No wonder that people are finding life tough,\" Dale said, adding: \"One of the most striking \u2013 and indeed encouraging \u2013 features of the performance of our economy since the financial crisis are the falls in real wages that have been achieved without a very sharp rise in unemployment. Unemployment has indeed risen, but by far less than would have been the case had the labour market displayed the resistance and rigidities of the past.\" The monthly ONS figures for the labour market showed that employment in the quarter ending in October 2012 was 40,000 higher than in the previous three months. Private sector employment was up by 65,000 to a record 23.9 million while public sector employment was down by 24,000 to 5.7 million - its lowest level since 2002. Despite job creation over the past year, unemployment is still 879,000 higher than it was in the summer of 2007, when the financial crisis began. The employment rate peaked at 73% in the early months of 2008 and currently stands at 71.2%. An alternative measure of unemployment \u2013 the claimant count \u2013 showed that the number of people on jobseeker's allowance fell by 3,000 to 1.58 million in November. Employment minister Mark Hoban said it was particularly encouraging that youth unemployment had fallen to its lowest level in three and a half years. \"But we're not complacent and know there are still lots of challenges ahead, which is why the Government will continue working hard to help those people who want to get on in life and allow the UK to compete in the global race.\" John Walker, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"It is good news that the labour market is inching in the right direction and that youth unemployment is falling. However, latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility suggest that unemployment will peak at 8.2% which may mean further job losses in the medium term. \"Small firms are key to hiring the economically inactive \u2013 an area in which unemployment rose by 60,000. Small firms that want to expand and take on more staff need an extra incentive. Extending the national insurance contributions holiday to all micro firms across the whole of the UK would be a good starting point. This would help to create an additional 45,000 jobs while adding \u00a31.3bn to GDP.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) has raised its estimates for oil demand next year but says soaring shale production in America should ensure there are no shortages in supply. Improving economic conditions in China and the US is likely to result in about 865,000 barrels of extra crude demand during 2013, to reach total consumption to 90.5m barrels a day, according to the IEA's latest oil report. That figure is more than 110,000 barrels more than estimated just four weeks ago even though the IEA believes demand will remain sluggish in the first half of the year. The expected increase in overall demand, plus increasing speculation that America is about to unleash a new round of quantitative easing to further boost the domestic economy, helped to raise Brent crude futures to $109 a barrel. Meanwhile, a meeting of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) ministers in Vienna agreed to hold its official output at 30m barrels a day. But there is unease inside Opec that relatively low-demand growth, accompanied by major increases in American and Iraqi oil production, could lead to a price collapse next year. Iraq is a member of Opec but made clear it would not help with any production cuts next year even if prices did dip, arguing that other members such as Saudi Arabia, which have previously increased their output, should make cuts first. After 20 years of war, sanctions and civil strife that left its oil industry in disarray, Iraq is in no mood to consider curtailing output just as it starts to take off. \"Iraq will never cut production,\" Iraq's Opec governor Falah Alamri told Reuters. \"Some countries that have increased their production in the last two years \u2013 they should do so. This is a sovereign issue, not an Opec issue.\" That was a clear reference to Saudi Arabia, which this summer lifted output to a 30-year high above 10m barrels a day to prevent oil prices soaring after western sanctions on Iran halved its production. The tensions inside Opec have increased since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the Arab spring, culminating in a row over who should lead the cartel when the secretary general, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, a Libyan national, steps down. Neil Atkinson, director of energy research at Datamonitor, said: \"Iraq is impervious to arguments. It says that it was subject to sanctions for so long that it has a free pass to rebuild its economy. \"There is rising oil from places like the United States, and Iraqi output is rising quite sharply. There's a risk that we see a sharp drop in price next year.\" Output from Iraq has increased by 1m barrels a day to 3.4m following the release of service contracts to western oil companies such as BP, Shell and ExxonMobil. The US Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday that US output would rise by 760,000 barrels a day in 2012, the fastest rate since commercial oil production began more than 150 years ago.",

But there is unease inside Opec that relatively low-demand growth, accompanied by major increases in American and Iraqi oil production, could lead to a price collapse next year.</p> <p>Iraq is a member of Opec but made clear it would not help with any production cuts next year even if prices did dip, arguing that other members such as Saudi Arabia, which have previously increased their output, should make cuts first.</p> <p>After 20 years of war, sanctions and civil strife that left its oil industry in disarray, Iraq is in no mood to consider curtailing output just as it starts to take off.</p> <p>\"Iraq will never cut production,\" Iraq's Opec governor Falah Alamri told Reuters. \"Some countries that have increased their production in the last two years \u2013 they should do so. This is a sovereign issue, not an Opec issue.\"</p> <p>That was a clear reference to Saudi Arabia, which this summer lifted output to a 30-year high above 10m barrels a day to prevent oil prices soaring after western sanctions on Iran halved its production.</p> <p>The tensions inside Opec have increased since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and the Arab spring, culminating in a row over who should lead the cartel when the secretary general, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, a Libyan national, steps down.</p> <p>Neil Atkinson, director of energy research at Datamonitor, said: \"Iraq is impervious to arguments. It says that it was subject to sanctions for so long that it has a free pass to rebuild its economy.</p> <p>\"There is rising oil from places like the United States, and Iraqi output is rising quite sharply. There's a risk that we see a sharp drop in price next year.\"</p> <p>Output from Iraq has increased by 1m barrels a day to 3.4m following the release of service contracts to western oil companies such as BP, Shell and ExxonMobil.</p> <p>The US Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday that US output would rise by 760,000 barrels a day in 2012, the fastest rate since commercial oil production began more than 150 years ago.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Gordon Brown deigned to pop across to Brussels to commune with his continental counterparts during his years at Number 11, he often spent as much time lecturing them about the benefits of Britain's flexible labour market as discussing the latest wrinkle in EU growth policy. But regimes drawn up in good times only reveal their full meaning when they're tested by adversity, and the grim reality of the flexible labour market in this non\u2013recovery is falling real wages, mass underemployment, and millions of families living hand\u2013to\u2013mouth. Wednesday's jobs figures signalled another rise in employment, so that a record 29.6m people are now in a job in the UK, the highest number since records began in 1971. That must be good news. But Wednesday's figures, showing that incomes are still rising at just 1.7% a year, when inflation is a percentage point higher, also lay bare the fact that the painful, post\u2013crisis adjustment in the UK's economy is being felt on the bottom line of millions of households' finances. As the Bank of England's chief economist Spencer Dale put it in a speech on Wednesday, shortly after the jobs figures were published, \"the harsh but inescapable reality,\" is that, \"households and families in our economy are worse off. Much worse off.\" He highlights the \"extraordinary flexibility\" of wages. Once adjusted for inflation, pay is now more than 15% lower than where it would have been if it had followed the pre\u2013crisis trend. In other words, the \"flexibility\" of the labour market has meant that anxious workers have had little choice but to accept paltry pay rises in exchange for holding on to their jobs. The Office for National Statistics has also revealed that the number of people who are \"underemployed\" \u2013 working fewer hours than they would like \u2013 has increased by more than a million since 2008, suggesting many are struggling to get by on less income than they would like. And at the same time as workers are accepting these unenviable choices, sterling is weaker on the world's foreign exchange markets, making imports more expensive. And the slow rate of economic growth, despite the improving employment picture, suggests productivity \u2013 measured as the amount each person produces per hour \u2013 has plunged. Economists aren't sure how to explain this last development \u2013 it may be because the battered financial sector is still casting a shadow across the rest of the economy, or some of the productivity uplift in the boom years was illusory. But as Dale points out, when combined with the decline in sterling, a sharp fall in productivity means we are producing less, just at the same time as \"the pound in our pocket\" buys less on the global market. \"The less we produce,\" and the less \"we can purchase using the proceeds from our domestically\u2013produced output\", he says \"the less we can ultimately consume\". In other words, most households are just going to have to get used to their living standards being lower than they were before the bubble burst \u2013 an extraordinary turnaround, after decades of steady improvement. No one would argue that mass unemployment on the scale seen in previous downturns would be preferable to the long, slow decline in living standards the UK's families now face. Unemployment brings with it severe social, economic and psychological problems, as well as the immediate damage to laid\u2013off workers' livelihoods. It's clearly better that the pain is being more widely shared. But it also means ministers seizing on the happy news of another rise in jobs \u2013 or tempted to laud the flexibility of Britain's labour market \u2013 must be senstive to the fact that millions of workers up and down the country may see little reason to cheer.",

      "bodyText": "The Fed also unexpected added some numerical targets, such as saying it was likely to keep interest rates close to zero as long as unemployment remained about 6.5%, inflation between one and two years ahead was forecast to be no more than 2.5% and long term inflation expectations remained contained. The full Fed release is here. As expected the US Federal Reserve has boosted its stimulus moves in an attempt to lift the country's economy. It said it was disappointed with the pace of recovery in employment, and the US budget impasse can only heighten the uncertainty. So it has committed to $45bn of longer term treasuries a month on top of the $40bn of mortage-backed bonds it started buying in September. Silvio Berlusconi has reportedly said he would not run for prime minister of Italy if current incumbent Mario Monti - who is resigning - returned to lead a centrist coalition. According to Reuters Berlusconi said he would back Monti as a canditate at the head of a \"moderate\" coalition. So, no worries about being too German then? Back with Greece, and some snippets from Dow Jones: The pre-Christmas rally has continued, if not particularly convincingly, as investors await the US Federal Reserve meeting and the two day EU summit beginning on Thursday. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 20.88 points higher at 5945.85 \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.33% \u2022 France's Cac has closed virtually unchanged, up just 0.01% \u2022 Spain's Ibex was up 0.83% \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB has ended up 1.15% \u2022 In Athens the market has edged up 0.14% \u2022 Ahead of the Fed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up around 7 points UK chancellor George Osborne said the UK supported the efforts to create a banking union, it was a logical consequence of a single currency. The UK would not be joining the banking union but has a huge interest in it working effectively, since 30% of EU banking is in the UK. He welcomed the spirit of consensus but said the voting arrangements should be a simple majority but with weighted votes. Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem had earlier said if the deadline of April 2014 was fixed, it needed to be clear that the ECB was ready and able to take on its role. Osborne agreed with that. He also said the agreement should be \"future proofed\" : Should the number of member states not participating in the banking union fall to say 4 or less, we would have to look again at how the voting arrangements work. He warned that the ECB should not have powers to intervene in countries not in the banking union, if those powers were not available to national regulators: It would be difficult to accept the ECB coming to exercise powers for Deutsche Bank in London when the Bank of England could not exercise similar powers for HSBC in Paris. Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's finance minister, has added his voice to those hoping for an agreement tonight or if not \"to get a final decision before Christmas.\" (Let's hope that was a joke). He said Ecofin was only looking for a political agreement for banking supervision - other issues like banking union were for the heads of government. They should also avoid the issue of direct banking recapitalisation, he said. And he warned not to create too much expectation: \"In the last three years we created expectations we could not fulfil.\" The key issue for Germany is that we have a clear distinction - a Chinese wall - between monetary policy and banking supervision. Monetary policy should be independent of the ECB. Banking supervision cannot be. He also said the meeting should not try to find a solution to the issue of a steering commitee but leave it to the future. EU finance ministers are currently discussing a compromise proposal put forward by Cyprus, which holds the EU presidency. The compromise involves banks with assets of \u20ac30bn or assets of more than one fifth of their country's GDP being supervised directly by the ECB. Smaller banks, if they become a problem, would also fall under the remit of the ECB, rather than national regulators. An update on Greece, courtesy of Dow Jones. Here's a live stream of the Ecofin meeting from the council website. Here's more Bloomberg on the EU draft proposals for this week's summit: European Union leaders will press for June 2013 agreement on how to handle failing banks and how to set minimum standards for deposit guarantee schemes, according to draft conclusions for this week\u2019s summit. Leaders will urge nations to agree on the two measures by March 31 and then reach an accord with the European Parliament by mid-year, according to Dec. 12 draft conclusions obtained by Bloomberg News. The timeline is a change from a Dec. 3 draft, which aimed to wrap up all agreement on the measures by March. Story here. More comments as finance ministers arrive for the meeting. Spanish economy minister Luis de Guindos said: We hope to have a deal today, we have made a lot of progress. We have a mandate from leaders to reach a deal. We need to establish different organs for supervision and monetary policy in the ECB. It is very important to send a message that we have a plan. Swedish finance minister Anders Borg said an agreement on banking union would be \"a sad day for Europe\". We could see an agreement today, but that's on the prerequisite that we would have a good compromise on European Banking Authority rules so that we have safeguards against being dominated by the ECB as supervisor. But he added: Sweden are not likely to join the banking union. We don't think it is likely we will achieve an equal treatment. We don't think that we have the safeguards when it come to the Swedish banks and the Swedish taxpayers not being responsible for banking mistakes in other countries. And we're off... The EU council site has videos of various dignitaries arriving for the Ecofin meeting here, including Wolfgang Schaeuble. Among other things, Sch\u00e4uble said Mario Monti's government in Italy had done better than its predecessor. Is that an endorsement Monti would want, after being accused by that predecessor and possible successor, Silvio Berlusconi, of being too German? While EU finance ministers haggle over the fine print of a new eurozone banking supervisor today in Brussels, the Germans have been playing down expectations of tomorrow\u2019s Brussels summit on the euro\u2019s future gameplan, reports Ian Traynor. Briefing reporters in Berlin, a senior German official did not even mention Herman Van Rompuy, the summit chair and main author of the euro \u201croadmap\u201d, the main points of which are eventually to introduce structural reform pledges by eurozone governments which are to be policed by the European Commission as well as the creation of a eurozone budget to help finance these reforms. The French and Germans are predictably at loggerheads over the scale and scope of these twin proposals. The French want the eurozone budget as a Keynesian growth tool, but do not want the commission enforcing policy in France. The Germans want the control and rigour brought by the contracts or pledges, but don\u2019t want to put up the money for the eurozone budget. \u201cEveryone wants to talk about money, but not about competitiveness which is the source of the problem,\u201d said the German official. \u201cBig pots of money are not on the German government\u2019s agenda.\u201d By contrast a senior official at the Elysee Palace said that the contracts \u201cshould not only be about structural reforms, but also about growth\u2026As soon as you sign the contract, you should get access to the fiscal capacity [eurozone budget].\u201d It transpires that David Cameron will be a bit of a bystander at tomorrow\u2019s summit since the two days of talks will be consumed by not very conclusive discussions on the \u201carchitecture\u201d of the eurozone. That prompted Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, to quip today that there was little point in Cameron going to these summits as Britain was now so \u201cmarginalised.\u201d Courtesy of Bloomberg via Newedge Strategy, some flashed from the EU draft document for the summit: *EU LEADERS TO CALL FOR SINGLE RESOLUTION PLAN IN 2013: DRAFT *EU DRAFT MAY BE MODIFIED AT DEC. 13-14 LEADERS SUMMIT *EU MAINTAINS CALL FOR 'CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS' AS OF 2013 *EU TO START `EX ANTE' DISCUSSION OF NATIONAL REFORMS IN 2013 *EU DRAFT SETS NO TIMELINE FOR POSSIBLE 'SHOCK ABSORBER' BUDGET *EU SUMMIT DRAFT DROPS 3-STAGE TIMELINE FOR EURO-ZONE OVERHAUL *EU COUNCIL DRAFT CONCLUSIONS OBTAINED BY BLOOMBERG NEWS *EU TO URGE NATIONS TO AGREE ON MEASURES BY MARCH, DRAFT SAYS *EU TO URGE JUNE 2013 ACCORD ON DEPOSIT SCHEMES, DRAFT SAYS *EU LEADERS TO URGE JUNE 2013 BANK RESOLUTION ACCORD, DRAFT SAYS I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher now but thanks for joining the blog. Over to Rome where Tom Kington has been looking at the latest twists in the political drama there. Tom writes: Italy may have lowered its borrowing costs at a one year debt auction on Wednesday, indicating the nervous reaction to news of Mario Monti\u2019s resignation has calmed, but political shenanigans in Italy suggest the election of a solid, reform-oriented government in February is not a given. The centre-left Democratic Party, which is leading the polls, may yet have trouble winning a Senate majority should Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s anti-austerity tub thumping win votes, and it could depend on an alliance with Nichi Vendola, the leader of the Left Ecology Liberty party on the left, and with centrist Pierferdinando Casini. Vendola however has said he refuses to enter a government with Casini, and, just as importantly, would never back a government that seeks to push on with Monti\u2019s austerity program. It is not all plain sailing for Berlusconi either. He is counting on reforging his old alliance with the Northern League, yet League officials have said they will only ally with Berlusconi\u2019s party if Silvio is replaced as leader. Berlusconi may hope to tempt the League with the chance to govern the Lombardy region in place of his backer Roberto Formigoni, who has been weakened by corruption allegations. Berlusconi meanwhile looks set to ratchet up his rabble rousing rhetoric after yesterday blaming Italy\u2019s economic crisis \u2013 which began while he was in power -- on Germany\u2019s decision to sell off Italian bonds, an ingenious way to blame Italy\u2019s problems on its neighbour. \u201cThis seems like the kind of talk typical of a trattoria, very late at night,\u201d said one union leader. The question is whether Italian voters are in a late night mood. Spain now and Giles Tremlett has been following the latest developments in the country's banking crisis, which on the face of it is not so bad as it was yesterday after it took delivery of nearly \u20ac40bn this morning. But the hard work might be about to start now for banks such as Bankia. Giles writes: Spain's \u20ac40bn of banking bailout money has today arrived from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) \u2013 and the shockwaves are already being felt in the largest recipient, Bankia. The failed collection of seven former cajas, or savings banks, had already said it planned to shed 6,000 workers as part of the \u20ac18bn bailout deal for the bank. But chairman Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Goirigolzarri had said this would be done as painlessly as possible via early retirement, the sale of units and outsourcing. Now unions say the bank has told them it wants to sack 5,000 people and reduce salaries by up to 40%. As one-third of the staff of El Pa\u00eds newspaper found out recently, changes to labour laws give loss-making Spanish businesses, or those with falling sales, a far wider scope for sacking employees or making them accept salary reductions instead. The rest of the bailout money goes to nationalised Catalunya Banc, Banco de Valencia, Novagalicia Banco and the new Sareb \u201cbad\u201d bank for toxic real estate. More may be needed for a second raft of banks that are currently trying to raise capital elsewhere. Before I do a lunchtime round-up, should just say that the FTSE100 is up 15 points at 5940, closing in on the 6,000 mark. Other markets are also up: DAX - up 0.39% at 7,619.65 CAC 40 up 0.05% at 3,648.02 IBEX - up 0.75% at 7,980.10 At the end of Helena's last post she mentions comments by Greece's central bank boss in which he says that the economy could rebound on the back of the latest rescue package. Optimistic you might think for an economy set to shrink by 21.5% in the five years to 2013. But the bank governor's upbeat tone reflects similarly optimistic remarks from the country's powerful development minister Costis Hatzidakis. Helena writes: \"I think the Greek economy is now standing before an economic upturn after five years of recession,\" Hatzidakis told Germany's leading business newspaper Handelsblatt. As such, he said, the country was \"thirsting\" for foreign investment in areas such as energy, tourism and agriculture. The politician based his optimism not only on the fact that talk of a Grexit had finally died down but that Greece had moved ahead with long-overdue structural reform that included deregulation of the transport system, energy sector and labor market. But unrest still continues. Protesting municipal employees, slated to lose jobs under EU-IMF mandated austerity measures, ralled en masse outside the reform ministry today. \"We are determined to continue our struggle to prevent dismissals ordered by the troika that the vile three-party government is pushing,\" said the employees' union, POE-OTA, announcing a 48-hour strike as of tomorrow. Clashes erupted outside parliament as unionists tried to jump over fencing erected around the building in Syntagma Square. Over to Greece, where our correspondent Helena Smith reports the country\u2019s debt management agency has announced it is seeking an additional \u20ac1.29bn from foreign lenders to finalise the buy-back scheme that formally closed on Tuesday. She writes: Although the take up was good, Greece has not quite got there yet. If the country is to successfully complete the buy back of its own debt \u2013 a prerequisite of receiving further rescue funds from the EU and IMF tomorrow \u2013 it will need foreign lenders to cough up an extra \u20ac1.29bn. In an announcement released at noon the agency said it had accepted to buy \u20ac31.9bn from holders of Greek debt at 33.8% of their face value. The buy back amounted to some 51.% of the total \u20ac61.44bn of government bonds held by the private sector. \u201cThe republic hereby announces that is has advised its official sector creditors that \u2026 it intends to accept all designated securities of each series validly offered for exchange,\u201d the agency said. The scheme will allow Greece to shave around \u20ac20 bn (once \u20ac11.9bn in repurchasing expenses are withheld) from its massive debt pile currently estimated at around \u20ac340bn or 175% of GDP. The IMF had made the buy back scheme a condition of continued financial assistance to a country that has seen its economy kept afloat by international creditors since May 2010. Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, said while she would reserve judgment \u201cI can only welcome the results that have been produced by the debt buy back.\u201d Meanwhile, Bank of Greece governor George Provopoulos, has just announced that the country\u2019s economy could be about to see an upswing, adds Helena. \u201cAfter serious delays and uncertainties, Greece finds itself today before new circumstances which under certain conditions could give new prospects to the economy,\u201d the central bank governor told parliament\u2019s committee of economic affairs. \u201cThese developments are positive and create well-founded hopes that the Greek economy can rebound perhaps even earlier that what is today foreseen,\u201d Provopoulos said. The Spanish government has confirmed that it has received the \u20ac39.5bn in bailout funds for the country's troubled banks. AP reports that a spokeswoman for the economy ministry said the money is now in the hands of the state-run fund set up to help those banks worst hit by the property market collapse in 2008. The money will be handed out in the coming days. One of the recipients, Bankia, said today it will sack thousands of workers to meet the terms of the bailout having said it would shed staff through voluntary redundancies and other such mutual agreements. Greece is also expected to get its long-delayed \u20ac34bn in aid after just about completing its bond buy-back yesterday. More from our correspondents in Madrid and Athens on these stories very soon. On the same theme, figures this morning from Darty, Europe's third largest electrical retailer, are interesting. The company formerly known as Kesa unveiled a strategic review basically saying that it's going to focus on core markets of France, Holland and Belgium. Fair enough but to rely on France has its own dangers. The Bank of France no less said this week that it expects the country to go into recession this quarter and there has been much speculation about how France could be the next shoe to drop in the eurozone crisis. More on those poor eurozone industry figures. Germany, France and Italy, which make up two-thirds of the eurozone's industrial production, all saw their factory output fall in October with Germany shrinking the most. Overall, only production of consumer goods such as food and cosmetics rose in October, with all other sectors falling. Output of cars, electronics and furniture fell almost 4%. The car industry seems especially weak with General Motors this week announcing the closure of its Bochum plant by 2016. In that same story we reported that 2012 has been the worst year for the French car industry since 1997, with sales of French cars down 28% in November from a year earlier. PSA Peugeot-Citroen, which plans to shed 10,000 jobs, is mothballing its Sochaux plant in eastern France for 19 days over the Christmas holiday period. The problem for French car makers is that they rely more on European demand than, say, UK manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover who are benefiting from growth in emerging markets. Some reaction to the unemployment stats. Labour's Liam Byrne welcomes the fall in overall numbers but makes the fair point that wages are being screwed down ever tighter. \u201cPay packets are taking an absolute hammering. Last month prices rose at twice the rate of wages. Grim figures on the eurozone economy. Industrial production in the currency bloc fell 1.4% in October, much worse than the expected 0.2% gain. The numbers confirm that the weakness of the eurozone is spreading from the periphery to the core. Here is the unemployment story by our economics editor Larry Elliott. As usual the job market figures are full of interesting details, not least of which is that the public sector payroll is at its lowest for a decade - 5.7 million. Private sector employment is at a record high with 23.8 million. Average wages are still rising below inflation at 1.7%. The number of Britons unemployed fell last month and the number of people in work hit a new high, the ONS said this morning. Full story coming very soon. Ian Traynor will be waiting for the outcome later today and in the meantime has sketched out the latest: George Osborne travels to Brussels this afternoon for a crunch meeting of EU finance ministers on a new eurozone banking supervisor and looks to be facing a Franco-German stitch-up over how power in the new authority will be wielded. \u201cThere is a Franco-German deal. The UK will still fight, but it looks pretty good,\u201d a senior EU source told The Guardian. The crucial point for Osborne is to secure \u201csafeguards\u201d protecting the UK financial sector against decisions taken by the eurozone in the shape of the European Central Bank which is to be the banking supervisor. The detail of the voting arrangements - between the 17 countries of the eurozone and the 10 EU countries not in the single currency - remain unclear. But to judge by the last few days in Brussels, they look unlikely to accommodate Britain\u2019s insistence on being able to block ECB decisions it deems unfavourable. Under the Franco-German pact, the London-based European Banking Authority, representing all 27, is to be given a mediation role in the event of a dispute over an ECB decision. Ian goes on to say: The Swedes and the Czechs are also unhappy with the arrangements and will support Britain today. It appears that the French and German finance ministries have been beavering away on an accord for the past week and cut the deal on Tuesday evening. Despite the agreement, the froideur between Paris and Berlin remains on a whole host of issues, with the splits certain to be on display at an EU summit opening tomorrow on the euro and the future of monetary union. EU finance ministers are meeting today to resolve differences over plans for the European Central Bank to supervise banks. They need to crack the problem before the EU summit tomorrow and Friday. France and Germany are at odds over the plan with Berlin resisting proposals for the eurozone's smallest banks to be covered by the new powers. It wants a minimum of \u20ac50bn in assets to apply while Paris wants a minimum of just \u20ac2.5bn. Divisions run deeper than just those across the Rhine with Sweden seemingly set to join Britain on the sidelines of any agreement. Its finance minister Anders Borg said yesterday that Sweden still had reservations about the lack of safeguards given to non-eurozone countries and he did not expect those problems to be resolved \"for the foreseeable future\". We'll try to keep tabs on the talks today. And if you want to read an expert view on the whole issue, here is our Europe editor Ian Traynor on the matter last week. Sorry for the lack of posts so far today but the blog has been hit by some technical problems. Anyway, back into it now and although it's fairly quiet out there in euroland there is still plenty to talk about. That's mainly the Fed statement tonight when Ben Bernanke is expected to start outright bond purchases of around $45bn to replace Operation Twist, which ends this month. The Fed is currently buying $40bn in long dated treasuries each month, funded by selling short dated bonds. This pushes up bond prices and forces yields lower, therefore keeping interest rates lower. It's also expected to be good for equities. Peter O'Flanagan of Clear Currency says this morning: The Operation Twist extension comes to an end this month that is why the market is expecting the Fed to step in a fill this void. The recent rally in US equities is evidence that market expectations are for suitable replacement to help support US growth, any form of disappointment is likely to weigh on US equities and benefit the US dollar as safe haven flows return. Good morning and welcome to the euro crisis live blog. The markets have mostly opened up this morning as investors look ahead to tonight's expected announcement by the US Federal reserve to throw another $45bn worth of electronic money at the US economy. More of that in a bit. The FTSE100 in London is creeping ever nearer the 6000 point mark again but it's now down a fraction this morning 5923. Anyway, here are the main things to look for today: UK unemployment at 9.30am Eurozone industrial production figures at 10am Fed statement at 5.30pm Bernanke press conference at 6.15pm",

The company is caught up in a bidding war with US chipmaker Ceva for control of MIPS Technologies. James Goodman at Investec said: Given the share's weak performance, we are initially encouraged by today's report, with a very strong royalty unit performance (237m units versus our 172m) and guidance to 500m full year units (versus our 429m). However, we calculate a 15% decline in average rates (due to higher volume of lower-end phones) which suggests full year royalty revenue unlikely to move up materially. In addition, Technology margin is down as costs rise and [digital radio business] Pure's loss has doubled. Hold. SuperGroup has fallen 27.5p to 569p even though the fashion retailer reported a 13% rise in first half profits to \u00a314.7m, as it recovered from recent disappointments. Chief executive Julian Dunkerton said the economic outlook was uncertain but he was confident of meeting its full year profit target. Caroline Gulliver at Espirito Santo said: While the business has stabilised, our view remains that consensus expectations of around \u00a350m pretax profit for 2013 are too high as the cost of growth becomes apparent. Given around 13% growth in first half profits, consensus implies an acceleration to 18.5% growth in the second half. We do not think that there is anything in the statement to suggest this acceleration, particularly given the fourth quarter weighting of new space.",

What does he hope to gain by predicting that the Virgin Atlantic name will disappear as a result of Delta's purchase of a 49% stake from Singapore Airlines? He has reinforced the stereotype that big bad BA is driven mad by the mere existence of little 'ol Virgin. Branson will love that \u2013 indeed, as ever, he is milking it. As it happens, it's odds-on that wee Willie loses his silly wager. The deal between Virgin and Delta, encompassing a joint venture on north Atlantic routes, was accompanied by a firm commitment from both sides that the Virgin Atlantic name will retained. Nothing is for ever, of course, but five years \u2013 the duration of the bet \u2013 doesn't seem a stretch. After all, Branson is keeping his 51% stake, and you can be 100% confident that the name will be retained as long as that shareholding structure survives. And, even if KLM or some other EU-based airline eventually buys part of Branson's holding, the bearded one may insist that his brand lives on. The terms of the Delta deal look reasonable from Virgin's point of view. Nobody is under any illusion about why this partnership is happening: BA, which already has a joint venture with American Airlines, has half the take-off slots at Heathrow after its purchase of BMI British Midland; Virgin, with only 3% of the slots, feels squeezed. Delta doesn't bring many additional Heathrow slots but it is the biggest US airline and may be able to deliver some of the promised \"significant corporate traffic flows\" as loyalty programmes are merged and flight schedules co-ordinated. That's assuming regulators give their approval \u2013 but they should. The deal represents a change of tack for Virgin Atlantic but after losing \u00a380m last year it had to do something. It's not a game-changer, but one can understand why Walsh is annoyed by the threat of greater competition.

    "webTitle": "Research highlights lack of women in executive roles", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The lack of women in executive roles is highlighted by two reports which also show compulsory quotas to install women in boardrooms have not increased their prospects of running big businesses. Research for the High Pay Centre and the Guardian shows quotas have boosted the number of non-executive women directors, but left the number in senior management stubbornly low. A separate report by the Association of British Insurers warns that a \"key area of concern for shareholders remains the lack of women executives in boardrooms\". The High Pay Centre research, by headhunters Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann, shows Norway leads the way with 35% non-executive women directors after firms were ordered to ensure that 40% of boardroom seats were held by women from 2008. However, the number of women in senior management has only risen from 15% to 18% in the past five years, with no female chief executive of any major Norwegian company. The country with the highest number of female chief executives is the US where there are no quotas but where women are in charge of 20 of the S&amp;P 500 leading companies. \"The research \u2026 begs the question as to whether quotas are truly effective in driving material change at the executive level, with many of those European countries that do have board quotas having few female senior leaders, and several having no female chief executives,\" said Sonamara Jeffreys, managing director of Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann. The fresh evidence of the low levels of full-time executives comes less than a month after the business secretary, Vince Cable, called on the eight FTSE 100 companies with men-only boards to improve their diversity. The ABI, whose members control a fifth of the stock market, warns in its report on boardroom effectiveness that the lack of women executives also has an impact on the number of women who become non-executive directors. \"The low number of women on boards is in part a symptom of insufficient numbers emerging at the top of the management structure and the under-representation of women in senior management generally,\" the ABI said. \"We continue to encourage companies to recognise their role in developing the potential of women in the corporate pipeline,\" the ABI said. From 1 October 2013 UK companies will need to disclose the proportion of women and men in boardrooms, in senior executives positions and through out the organisation. The ABI wants companies to begin disclosing the proportion of women they employ and in their boardrooms before then. The ABI, which remains opposed to compulsory quotas and opposes legislation, argued that legislation would fail to address the underlying issue of how women progress through their organisation. The High Pay Centre report warned: \"There is a danger that appointing women to non-executive board positions is used as window dressing for companies that are doing little to promote women through the executive ranks. \"There is a danger that governments believe they have fixed the diversity issue by introducing quotas on overall board membership whilst not addressing the dearth of women actually running companies.\" By comparison, in the UK, which takes a more voluntary approach brought in after Lord Davies recommended women make up 25% of FTSE 100 boardroom positions by 2015, there has been an increase from 11% to 17% in female representation on boards, with women in senior management positions up to 19%. However, the departure of Cynthia Carroll from Anglo American and Marjorie Scardino from Pearson leaves only two women bosses in the FTSE 100 \u2013 Angela Ahrendts at Burberry and Alison Cooper at Imperial Tobacco. All except Cooper are American. Consideration is now being given as to whether such quotas should be introduced for the FTSE 250, where the ABI's research found that 59 companies still had no women on their boards. Eight FTSE 100 companies have no female representation on their boards. The Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann research found that the biggest companies in France, Germany, Japan, Belgium and Italy all had no women chief executive. Other countries with legislation include Spain, with a 40% women quota by 2015. However, since the quotas were announced, female board membership has increased from 7% to just 13% \u2013 almost all in non-executive positions, while women in senior management has increased from 7% to 10%. In Sweden, which also has a target of a 50/50 gender balance by 2010, new rules appear to be working, with 25% of women sitting in boardrooms and the highest number of female senior management, at 22%. Last month the EU had hoped to introduced mandatory quotas of 40% across Europe. However, this was watered down after opposition orchestrated by the UK, leaving the decision to individual member states. In the US, where no boardroom quotas exist, just 17% of board members are women \u2013 a number which has remained unchanged for the past seven years. And according to the Catalyst Census of Fortune 500 women board and executive directors, only 14.3% of executive officers were women, the same level for a third year in a row. They also found that the gender imbalance over pay remains, with female workers making up just 8% of the highest earners in the country. Non-white women held only 3% of board seats and more than 65% of Fortune 500 companies had no female board members from ethnic minorities at at all. However, in terms of total women chief executives at the head of major companies, the US tops the worldwide list. There are currently 20 running companies in the S&amp;P 500.",

The ABI, whose members control a fifth of the stock market, warns in its report on boardroom effectiveness that the lack of women executives also has an impact on the number of women who become non-executive directors.</p> <p>\"The low number of women on boards is in part a symptom of insufficient numbers emerging at the top of the management structure and the under-representation of women in senior management generally,\" the ABI said.</p> <p>\"We continue to encourage companies to recognise their role in developing the potential of women in the corporate pipeline,\" the ABI said.</p> <p>From 1 October 2013 UK companies will need to disclose the proportion of women and men in boardrooms, in senior executives positions and through out the organisation.
