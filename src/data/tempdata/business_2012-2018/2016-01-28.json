      "bodyText": "The dealmaker who played a key role in finding backers for Barclays\u2019 emergency fundraising during the 2008 financial crisis has filed a lawsuit against the lender and is reportedly seeking nearly \u00a31bn. A spokesman for Amanda Staveley confirmed the existence of the claim but declined to put a figure on the total being sought by the financier and her firm, PCP Capital Partners. However, the Financial Times reported that Staveley is suing for almost \u00a31bn. Staveley, who is using the London law firm Fladgate for the dispute, is believed to be arguing that the bank has not fully paid the fees due to her for setting in motion a crucial investment, said to be worth around \u00a33.5bn, from Abu Dhabi\u2019s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan. In the aftermath of the financial crash, Barclays was desperate to bolster its balance sheet to stay out of the hands of the Labour-led UK government. Its share price plunged as a government rescue, as was needed by Lloyds Bank and RBS, became a very real threat. PCP Capital Partners is going ahead with the dispute against Barclays, which will be defended by an entirely new management team to the one embroiled in the controversy in 2008. The claim from PCP is likely to include an element for damages, a source said. According to the Financial Times, Barclays said in a statement: \u201cWe believe the claim against Barclays is misconceived and without merit and Barclays will be vigorously defending it.\u201d Full details of the case are expected to be unveiled in official court documents in 14 days\u2019 time. As well as Staveley\u2019s clients, the bank also attracted investment from a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority. That part of the deal is currently the subject of an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. Staveley, 42, has always had extensive connections in the Middle East. Born and raised in Yorkshire, she was based in Dubai for several years but has now relocated to London. When asked in a 2011 interview to explain her success in leading deals, she said: \u201cI can see an opportunity or a problem faster than any lawyer. I can see a document and find a hole in it, or I can understand what I can put in to make the contract work.\u201d Staveley has been involved in several high-profile deals throughout her career. In 2008, she brokered the acquisition of Manchester City Football Club, also with Sheikh Mansour. She often invests her company\u2019s own cash alongside her clients\u2019 investment.",

In the past decades, Saudi-led Opec has acted as a swing producer, slashing its production to lift global prices. But at a meeting of the cartel last month in Vienna, the Saudis argued against changing Opec output targets.

    "webTitle": "FCA orders new inquiry into HBOS chiefs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "City regulators are to investigate the role of HBOS\u2019s senior management in the near-collapse of the bank during the financial crisis more than seven years ago. The Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) will look into the bank\u2019s former bosses, who could be barred from working in the City. The FCA said the investigations would decide whether the senior figures, who include the former chief executive Andy Hornby and former chairman Lord Stevenson, should face proceedings that could strike them off the FCA\u2019s approved persons list. The FCA declined to identify which past managers it would investigate. Those under investigation have been informed, although the names have not been made public, and the FCA has appointed investigators with the power to call subjects in for questioning as it re-examines evidence. Potential penalties against the bank bosses do not include fines, due to a three-year time limit. That limit has since been extended to six years. The investigation is likely to take many months and could face multiple legal hurdles if individuals choose to challenge potential attempts to ban them. The decison follows a highly critical report in November by Andrew Green QC into decisions made by the FCA\u2019s predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, over HBOS. The bank, which traded on the high street as Halifax and Bank of Scotland, was rescued by Lloyds in a Labour government-engineered deal in September 2008. Green criticised the FSA\u2019s decision to ban and fine HBOS\u2019s former head of corporate banking Peter Cummings from working in the City, but leave others free to carry on their business careers. But he said the FSA was reasonable in deciding not to investigate James Crosby, who quit as chief executive in 2006 and has since handed back a knighthood over the HBOS affair. Green said the regulators should consider immediately whether to investigate other former managers of HBOS, including Hornby and Stevenson, and that the regulator was wrong not to have considered investigations into other former bosses. Regulators have also faced intense political pressure to look again at HBOS. The Financial Reporting Council said last week that it would re-examine KPMG\u2019s auditing of the bank after criticism from the Treasury select committee, which also called on the FCA to hold individuals to account. Andrew Tyrie, the committee chairman, said: \u201cOverdue doesn\u2019t capture it. It is eight years since the collapse of HBOS. It has taken a heap of pressure from parliament to secure appropriate action from the regulators. \u201cMr Green concluded that the FSA should have got on with this in 2009. So the FCA and PRA should conduct these investigations immediately.\u201d Hornby revived his career, first as chief executive of Alliance Boots and, since 2011, at the bookmaker Gala Coral, where he is chief operating officer. Gala Coral, which is privately owned, is planning to merge with Ladbrokes in a deal that would put Hornby back near the top of a public company, though not on the board. The FCA cannot bar someone from being a company director outside the finance industry, but the Department for Business can do. Other former HBOS leaders who could face investigation include the former finance chief Mike Ellis, the chairman of Skipton building society, Colin Matthew, who ran HBOS\u2019s international division, and Lindsay Mackay, who ran the treasury operation. Gala Coral said Hornby had played an important role in improving the bookmaker\u2019s business and that he had the confidence of colleagues, management and the company\u2019s owners. Skipton said neither Ellis nor the building society had been contacted by the FCA about its decision. Stevenson could not be reached through the House of Lords. In November, he and other former HBOS directors issued a statement saying that an investigation into their conduct was not warranted. HBOS, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, was almost brought down by reckless corporate lending and attempts to run its treasury operation for maximum profit. Green\u2019s review of the FSA\u2019s decisions on HBOS accompanied a wider report into the bank\u2019s failure that described an inexperienced board and a management team which ignored risks in a quest for growth. The bank\u2019s lending spree caused bad debts of \u00a345bn \u2013 more than the \u00a338bn in losses racked up by the far larger Royal Bank of Scotland. After Lloyds bought HBOS, the combined bank was bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayers\u2019 money as Gordon Brown\u2019s government tried to prevent the financial system from collapsing. George Osborne announced on Thursday that he was postponing the sale of the final 9% of Lloyds shares owned by taxpayers due to volatile financial markets.",

The FCA declined to identify which past managers it would investigate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/19/hbos-timeline-countdown-collapse-lloyds-takeover\">HBOS timeline: the countdown to collapse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those under investigation have been informed, although the names have not been made public, and the FCA has appointed investigators with the power to call subjects in for questioning as it re-examines evidence. </p> <p>Potential penalties against the bank bosses do not include fines, due to a three-year time limit. That limit has since been extended to six years. The investigation is likely to take many months and could face multiple legal hurdles if individuals choose to challenge potential attempts to ban them.</p> <p>The decison follows a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/nov/19/hbos-report-stock-markets-federal-reserve-live\">highly critical report in November</a> by Andrew Green QC into decisions made by the FCA\u2019s predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, over HBOS. The bank, which traded on the high street as Halifax and Bank of Scotland, was rescued by Lloyds in a Labour government-engineered deal in September 2008.</p> <p>Green criticised the FSA\u2019s decision to ban and fine HBOS\u2019s former head of corporate banking Peter Cummings from working in the City, but leave others free to carry on their business careers. But he said the FSA was reasonable in deciding not to investigate James Crosby, who quit as chief executive in 2006 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/apr/09/james-crosby-give-up-knighthood-pension\">has since handed back a knighthood</a> over the HBOS affair.</p> <p>Green said the regulators should consider immediately whether to investigate other former managers of HBOS, including Hornby and Stevenson, and that the regulator was wrong not to have considered investigations into other former bosses.</p> <p>Regulators have also faced intense political pressure to look again at HBOS. The Financial Reporting Council said last week that it would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/21/accounting-watchdog-frc-kpmg-audit-hbos\">re-examine KPMG\u2019s auditing of the bank</a> after criticism from the Treasury select committee, which also called on the FCA to hold individuals to account.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the committee chairman, said: \u201cOverdue doesn\u2019t capture it. It is eight years since the collapse of HBOS. It has taken a heap of pressure from parliament to secure appropriate action from the regulators.</p> <p>\u201cMr Green concluded that the FSA should have got on with this in 2009. So the FCA and PRA should conduct these investigations immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Hornby revived his career, first as chief executive of Alliance Boots and, since 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/18/andy-hornby-new-boss-coral\">at the bookmaker Gala Coral</a>, where he is chief operating officer. Gala Coral, which is privately owned, is planning to merge with Ladbrokes in a deal that would put Hornby <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/23/andy-hornby-return-ladbrokes-coral-talks\">back near the top of a public company</a>, though not on the board. The FCA cannot bar someone from being a company director outside the finance industry, but the Department for Business can do.</p> <p>Other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/19/hbos-collapse-where-are-the-main-players-now\">former HBOS leaders who could face investigation</a> include the former finance chief Mike Ellis, the chairman of Skipton building society, Colin Matthew, who ran HBOS\u2019s international division, and Lindsay Mackay, who ran the treasury operation.</p> <p>Gala Coral said Hornby had played an important role in improving the bookmaker\u2019s business and that he had the confidence of colleagues, management and the company\u2019s owners. Skipton said neither Ellis nor the building society had been contacted by the FCA about its decision. </p> <p>Stevenson could not be reached through the House of Lords. In November, he and other former HBOS directors issued a statement saying that an investigation into their conduct was not warranted.</p> <p>HBOS, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, was almost brought down by reckless corporate lending and attempts to run its treasury operation for maximum profit. Green\u2019s review of the FSA\u2019s decisions on HBOS accompanied a <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/Documents/publications/reports/hbos.pdf\">wider report into the bank\u2019s failure</a> that described an inexperienced board and a management team which ignored risks in a quest for growth.</p> <p>The bank\u2019s lending spree caused bad debts of \u00a345bn \u2013 more than the \u00a338bn in losses racked up by the far larger Royal Bank of Scotland.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has discovered that share prices can go down as well as up. The chancellor has postponed his plan to flog \u00a32bn of Lloyds Banking Group shares to the public because stock markets are deemed too \u201cturbulent\u201d, by which he means that Lloyds shares sit at 64p, well below the state\u2019s break-even price of 73.6p. Spring had been the deadline for the sale \u2013 now it\u2019s not. The scheme can be resuscitated at a later date but there is a simple moral to this tale: don\u2019t make promises on timing, because markets can make you look foolish. The chancellor started talking about \u201cthe biggest privatisation for 20 years\u201d before the 2015 general election, trying to summon Thatcherite visions of a \u201cshareholding democracy\u201d. At the Conservative party conference in October, the unwise \u201cnext spring\u201d pledge was made. Technically speaking, the Treasury could have gone ahead with the retail offer because the formal promise not to sell below 73.6p applied only to sales to institutional investors \u2013 that \u201cdrip-feed\u201d process has successfully reduced the state\u2019s stake in Lloyds from 43% in 2013 to 9%. In practice, a springtime sale would have risked yet more accusations of shortchanging the public purse. The idea was to give private punters a 5% discount to the market price, plus loyalty bonuses. That plan always had the whiff of a bung to those people able to write a cheque for a few thousand quid at short notice, as argued here at the time. But the political storm would have been more intense if the shares were departing at 60p, rather than the 80p-ish that Osborne had surely originally hoped for. In that sense, postponement is correct decision \u2013 politically and for the public coffers. Indeed, a delay has been inevitable for weeks. But before Osborne spends too much time congratulating himself on his \u201cresponsible\u201d move, he should ask why Lloyds\u2019 share price has fallen by a quarter since May. Yes, those pesky turbulent markets are a major contributor. But Lloyds \u2013 more than any other big UK bank \u2013 is also a proxy for the market\u2019s view of the health of the UK economy. Investors sense bigger problems for the chancellor than an embarrassing delay in a \u00a32bn share sale. Is Russian-Saudi oil production cut really in the pipeline? It was another wild day in oil markets, this time triggered by reports that Russia wants to talk to Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Opec cartel about production cuts to try to force prices higher. If they happened, coordinated cuts would be a very big development. The oil market, it is said, is oversupplied by about 1m barrels a day: that could be cleared if Russia and the Saudis both reduced output by 5%. It is easy to see why recessionary Russia would dearly love the Saudis to cut, but it is still a stretch to believe that a deal will happen. The Saudis don\u2019t want to cede any share of the oil market to new Iranian supplies. Production of US shale oil seems, finally, to be falling, which many assumed was the point of the Saudis\u2019 \u201ckeep pumping\u201d policy. And, as thinktank Capital Economics points out, \u201cit is not obvious that Russia would be a reliable partner\u201d. Its competing oil firms cannot be controlled in the way that state-owned Saudi Aramco can. Anything is possible, of course, in the current oil climate, but the Saudis have another reason to be wary of Russian overtures. From the point of view of producers, a failed deal is worse than no deal: it advertises weakness. HBOS inquiry: disgracefully late is better than never The investigation of HBOS bosses, mark two, can\u2019t fail to be better than the original version. Recall Andrew Green QC\u2019s damning verdict \u2013 \u201cmaterially flawed\u201d \u2013 in November on the old Financial Services Authority\u2019s timid efforts back in 2009 that led to action against only Peter Cummings, the bank\u2019s former head of corporate lending. Given that backdrop, it will have been the easiest decision in the world for the FSA\u2019s successors \u2013 the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority \u2013 to decide that, yes, they will begin investigations into \u201ccertain former HBOS senior managers\u201d. Andrew Bailey, soon to transfer from the PRA to the FCA, had signalled as much in November when the official report into the failure of HBOS was finally published; it was just a question of going through the formalities of launching an investigation. Can we, then, expect a speedy outcome? After all, a lot of the work should already have been done. Don\u2019t hold your breath. When individuals dispute findings, these investigations can take up to two years to conclude. That could mean that it will be 2017, or even 2018, before the full results are known. HBOS failed in 2008 \u2013 an age ago \u2013 but don\u2019t think that the passage of time renders the fresh investigation pointless. Disgracefully late is still better than never.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Margrethe Vestager: the woman prepared to take Google to task over tax", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At a time when the foundations of the European Union have never looked shakier, Margrethe Vestager is a powerful reminder that Brussels, when it works as it should, has clout. The EU competition commissioner\u2019s threat to investigate the British government\u2019s controversial tax settlement with Google and take action if she deems it necessary is no empty one, as multinationals such as Fiat, Starbucks, Gazprom and \u2013 in a separate case \u2013 Google can attest. In her continuing fight against anti-competitive behaviour by global corporations and the unfair aid given to them by member states, Vestager is aided by robust European legislation that allows her, for example, to fine guilty firms up to 10% of their global turnover. But she also brings to the job a determined, no-nonsense personality seen as tough even by Danish standards; an actual, working sense of humour \u2013 unconventional in Brussels \u2013 and a quirky charm best exemplified by her longstanding habit of knitting during meetings, especially elephants. Vestager, a member of the Social Liberal party, was appointed competition commissioner in 2014 after a stellar career in Danish politics, a world of minority governments, fragile coalitions, consensus and compromise. In that setting, she appeared steely and cold-blooded almost to the point of callousness. Vestager pushed through swingeing cuts to the country\u2019s once-sacrosanct unemployment and early retirement benefits while economic affairs minister in the unstable three-party leftist coalition headed by the former Social Democrat prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Then widely considered by Danish media and pollsters to be the most powerful politician in the country, before even Thorning-Schmidt, Vestager won recognition on the European stage during Denmark\u2019s 2012 presidency of the EU council, chairing the Ecofin finance ministers\u2019 meetings. Her coolness has at times been startling. Asked about the misery likely to be endured by people losing their benefits, Vestager, who has an economics degree from Copenhagen University and has also served as education minister and deputy prime minister, replied: \u201cWell, that\u2019s the way it goes.\u201d But a similar single-mindedness has been evident in Brussels. Since her arrival, Vestager has already tackled Google, launching formal antitrust proceedings against the company in April last year over accusations that it uses its dominance as a search engine to unfairly privilege Google\u2019s online shopping service over those of its rivals. She also has the mostly state-owned Russian gas company Gazprom firmly in her sights, which she suspects of unfair pricing and illegally interfering with the energy markets in at least eight European countries. Vestager is also looking at the subsidies paid by some European governments to their electricity utilities, arguing that they may amount to illegal state aid. Despite the fact that her boss, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, is a former prime minister of Luxembourg, she has not shied away from pursuing watershed test cases against the preferential tax treatment allegedly and variously granted to multinationals Amazon, Apple, Starbucks and Fiat by Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Fiat and Starbucks have already been ordered to pay tens of millions of euros; verdicts on Amazon and Apple await. Vestager insists she is not opposed to ultra-low taxes in principle, as long as they are available to everyone and not just a select multinational few. \u201cI was brought up with a very strong value that you should always protect the small and the few against those who want to misuse their muscle and weight in order to get what they weren\u2019t supposed to,\u201d she told Reuters just before her appointment. In another interview, Vestager said: \u201cIf you as a company can get a deal that I as a company cannot get, you can compete with me but not on the merits, because your tax burden is not the same as mine.\u201d An intern in the European parliament and a senior civil servant before being elected to the Danish parliament in 2001, Vestager, 47, is married to a secondary school maths and philosophy teacher with whom she has three daughters. Her admission that Sidse Babett Knudsen, who plays Denmark\u2019s fictional prime minister in Borgen, \u201cfollowed me around when I was economic affairs minister, to see how it works,\u201d prompted speculation she was one of the main inspirations for Knudsen\u2019s character, Birgitte Nyborg, in the hit TV drama. But perhaps the most revealing revelation about the straight-talking, tough-acting commissioner is that when she headed off for Brussels in 2014, she left her successor as Denmark\u2019s economic affairs minister a handknitted elephant \u2013 reportedly by no means the first she has produced \u2013 along with a note. \u201cI have knitted a friend for you,\u201d the note said. \u201cIt is an elephant. Elephants are social, thoughtful animals. They live in communities and \u2013 I have to say it \u2013 in matriarchal societies. They bear no grudge, but they remember well.\u201d Google might take that as a warning.",

    "webTitle": "Osborne suspends Lloyds share sale; UK growth hits 0.5% - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been an awfully busy day, so let\u2019s wrap up with a reminder of the key points (with links to the appropriate news stories) The government has slammed the brakes on its plan to sell its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to the public. Chancellor George Osborne said it would have been \u201cfrankly quite irresponsible\u201d to press on with the sale when Lloyds shares are just 64p, compared to a break-even price of 74p. City analysts say Osborne made the right decision, but political opponents have claimed he was reckless in pushing for the sale at all. The UK economy has posted its weakest annual growth in three years. New GDP figures showed that the economy expanded by 1.9% year-on-year in the last three months of 2015. On a quarterly basis, GDP rose by 0.5%. City regulators have reopened investigations into the senior managers who ran HBOS, before its collapse in 2007. The probe could lead to former HBOS being banned from the City for mismanaging the bank, which was rescued by Lloyds - triggering a taxpayer-led bailout (and leaving George Osborne with a lot of shares to sell) The EC has proposed new rules to prevent multinational companies gaming the system and avoiding paying a fair rate of tax. Announcing the move, commissioners Pierre Moscovici vowed to \u2018name and shame\u2019 those who didn\u2019t play by the rules, but denied planning to impose a flat rate of corporation tax across the EU. He also confirmed the EU could investigate the UK\u2019s new tax deal with Google. And it\u2019s been another volatile day in the markets. Oil soared, then subsided, when rumours of OPEC supply cuts were denied. Traders were cautious, after the US Federal Reserve said last night it was watching the global economic and financial system closely. The FTSE 100 shed 1%, or 58 points, to close at 5931. And there were bigger losses across Europe, on concerns that global economic problems is hurting Europe\u2019s recovery. Conner Campbell of Spreadex has the details: The UK index has flailed about for much of the day, only just recovering from its lunch-time losses to start the US session flat. The Eurozone was a whole different story; plunging nearly 1.5% the DAX got a taste of the dramatic today, struggling in the face of Germany\u2019s weak inflation and import prices figures. This helped drag the CAC with it, though the French index was slightly less hysterical, tumbling around 35 points as the day wore on. And that is all for today. Thanks, and goodnight. GW There\u2019s also speculation that Lloyds could be planning to set even more money aside to cover Payment Protection Insurance compensation. The chancellor might want to keep the share sale off the table, until the PPI scandal is off the agenda again. Raul Sinha, banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase said: \u201cWe are estimating that Lloyds will take \u00a33bn of PPI provisions up to 2018 and the market fears that they might decide to take some of that now.\u201d Yesterday, Royal Bank of Scotland announced another \u00a3500m to cover PPI claims, while Santander put aside \u00a3450m. PPI has already cost Lloyds an eye-watering \u00a314bn, making it the biggest culprit. Susan Kramer, Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, has criticised the chancellor for his eagerness to sell the government\u2019s remaining stake in Lloyds: She said (via the Financial Times): \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s dash to sell off the public\u2019s stake in Lloyds as soon as possible was already a bad idea. \u201cIt is worrying that it has taken a major collapse in global economic confidence to finally make him see sense.\u201d More volatility in the markets! Shares are diving on both sides of the Atlantic, as OPEC members rubbish today\u2019s rumour of production cuts. The FTSE 100 index of blue chip shares listed in London has now shed 97 points, or 1.6%, to 5892. Not a great environment to be launching the Lloyds retail share offering. The German DAX has slumped by 2.4%. And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones is now in the red, extending yesterday\u2019s losses. The selloff also follows some disappointing US economic data, showing a big drop in durable goods production (that machinery and long-lasting goods). Capital Economics explains: The 5.1% m/m decline in durable goods was due primarily to a sharp decline in the notoriously volatile aircraft component. Nevertheless, the details suggest that equipment investment shrank in the fourth quarter. Can\u2019t argue with this tweet..... Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, agrees that Osborne couldn\u2019t have got away with selling Lloyds to the public on the cheap. But the chancellor should consider exactly why the bank\u2019s shares have fallen so much this year. He writes: Before Osborne spends too much time congratulating himself on his \u201cresponsible\u201d move, he should ask why Lloyds\u2019 share price has fallen by a quarter since last May\u2019s election. Yes, those pesky turbulent markets are a major contributor. But Lloyds \u2013 more than any other big UK bank \u2013 is also a proxy for the market\u2019s view of the health of the UK economy. Investors sense bigger problems for the chancellor than an embarrassing delay in a \u00a32bn share-sale. City firm IG reckons that the Lloyds share sale will be a success, eventually. IG analyst Chris Beauchamp reports that there\u2019s plenty of public interest in it: \u201cResearch conducted by IG shows there is significant public appetite for the Lloyds share offer, with 43% of the UK adult population being aware of the offer and 6% likely to apply. This is the equivalent of 2.4 million people, which exceeds the government\u2019s goal of engaging 2 million investors based on them investing \u00a31000. But who are those 2 million people? I\u2019d guess that many of them will be experienced investors, who aren\u2019t daunted by the City, and who also have a spare grand to invest. Speaking of the markets... the oil price is suddenly surging. Brent crude has leapt 8% to $35 per barrel, a remarkable move, following reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia might agree a 5% production cut. However, there\u2019s nothing official yet.... Is Osborne justified in blaming \u2018market turbulence\u2019 for scuppering the Lloyd sale (at least temporarily)? I think so. The FTSE 100 has fallen by around 7% since last October, but bank shares have suffered a steeper decline - as this chart shows. And other global markets have seen bigger losses. German\u2019s DAX index has lost almost 9% since the start of this year, a period in which Japan\u2019s Nikkei is down 10%. Economic problems in China, the oil price rout, and fears of a global slowdown and rising deflation have all spooked investors this year. There\u2019s little prospect of Lloyds share price surging from 63p to the 74p break-even point anytime soon. Pausing the Lloyds float is embarrassing for the government, but it does avoid the possibility of a failed privatisation. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell, says a Lloyds flop could have undermined the zeal for Thatcherite privatisations. He says: \u201cOsborne will clearly be looking for a better deal for the Government, to maximise returns as best he can, and he won\u2019t want any issue that was aiming for substantial involvement from private investors to be a flop. That would damage already fragile sentiment and make it harder for any future privatisations to do well. It\u2019s more than two years since the government sold off Royal Mail, prompting claims that it had sold the firm off far too cheaply. Royal Mail shares are worth 450p today, around a third higher than the 330p float price, and peaked at over \u00a36. That\u2019s the problem with flotations. If shares slide, they were a rip-off. And if they surge, then the company was sold off too cheaply. George Osborne took his mind off the Lloyds sale suspension and the Google tax tow with a trip to Airbus\u2019s factory in Filton this morning. Looks like the chancellor enjoyed himself: Banking analyst Ian Gordon says George Osborne has made the right call given the circumstances. The Press Association has the details: Lloyds shares were to be offered to retail investors at a 5% discount to the market price, with a bonus share for every 10 shares held by the investors for more than a year. \u201cIf Osborne were to have gone ahead with the sale to retail investors ... this would have produced an effective price of sub 60 pence,\u201d said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. \u201cThat would be politically and economically impossible to justify. So I think that this (decision) is perfectly sensible.\u201d A Downing Street spokesperson has also blamed the current stock market volatility for the decision to postpone the Lloyds retail offering, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s important that any share sale delivers value for money and we have to take account of current market conditions.\u201d And the market conditions aren\u2019t great today. After a calm start, the FTSE 100 has now fallen by 30 points or 0.5% to 5958. Lloyds shares have dropped by 1.5% to 63.93p -- around 10p shy of the break-even level (as explained earlier). Lloyds Banking Group has issued a statement: \u201cThe Government has already been able to progressively reduce its stake in the Group from 43% to just 9% today, returning over \u00a316 billion to taxpayers at a profit. This reflects the hard work undertaken over the last four years to transform the Group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank. The timing of any future retail sale is a matter for the Government. Our focus is on moving the Group forward so that it can continue to be profitable and deliver sustainable returns to all our shareholders.\u201d Sky News also ask George Osborne if he regrets calling the \u00a3130m Google tax deal a major success (when speaking to the Guardian at the World Economic Forum in Davos last Saturday). Osborne says that his only interest as chancellor of the exchequer is to get the best deal for Britain. Google used to pay no tax, now it is paying tax. And he cites his new diverted profits tax, which is aimed at large multinationals who artificially shift their profits offshore. I regard that as a major success, he adds. Clearly there is more to do, and the ultimate solution is to create more succesful UK companies. So he\u2019s still using the \u2018major success\u2019 line, but appears to be tweaking it to cover his general action on tax avoidance, not just the Google deal. Sky News just broadcast their interview with George Osborne. In it, he says it would be \u201cfrankly quite irresponsible\u201d to embark on a major share sale when the markets are so volatile. His aim is to get the best deal for the public and the country. Q: Is the sale of Royal Bank of Scotland shares also going to be postponed? Osborne says he will continue, when it\u2019s right, to sell RBS shares to the market. \u201cMy interest is a bank that works for the British people, that\u2019s out there lending to businesses, but also ensuring that over time we do get out of that bank. We will continue to make sales to the market. Britain currently owns around 70% of Royal Bank of Scotland, whose share price is around half the break-even price of 500p. The government is aiming to sell shares to City institutions, rather than to the public. Hundreds of thousands of small investors will be disappointed by the postponement of the Lloyds shares sale, says Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. He points out that Osborne had promised to sell the shares at a 5% discount to the market price, so he must now hope for a recovery in markets later in the year. Market volatility in recent months has seen UK stock market values fall by around 20% since the April 2015 high, so its understandable that the share sale is being delayed. The government are committed to returning the Bank to private hands and within that had previously pledged to offer at least \u00a32 billion as a retail offering. Therefore we expect this share sale to proceed at some stage but the timescales are unknown. Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway smells a rat with the timing of the Lloyds news: For anyone just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on the Lloyds share sale suspension: George Osborne has postponed the sale of the last taxpayer-owned tranche of Lloyds Bank shares this spring, blaming \u201cmarket turbulence\u201d. The chancellor pledged in last year\u2019s election manifesto to sell the remaining stake in the bank \u2013 just under 10% of the company \u2013 to the public this spring. However, he told Sky News and other broadcasters that he has decided to delay the sale following the sharp selloff in stock markets in recent weeks. Several indices, including London\u2019s leading share index, entered bear market territory earlier this month, pressured by the slump in oil prices coupled with concerns about China and global economic slowdown. The FTSE has recovered this week but it global equity markets remain volatile. The Lloyds share price has dropped more than 10% below the price at which the government would make a profit from the share sale. Osborne told reporters that: I want to create a share-owning democracy. It\u2019s also my responsibility to ensure economic responsibility so with these turbulent financial markets now is not the right time to have that sale. \u201cWe will sell Lloyds to the British people but we will do so when the time is right.\u201d It is yet another U-turn on a manifesto pledge, following his change of heart over tax credit cuts in the autumn statement. By announcing the postponement today, George Osborne avoids breaking the bad news in March\u2019s budget. But this is still a blow to his plans, and probably means he\u2019ll need to borrow more money to balance the books. The chancellor has billed the sale as the \u201cbiggest privatisation for 20 years\u201d. He was planning to raise \u00a32bn through the retail offering to small shareholders that has now been halted. Osborne announced the sale at the Tory party conference last October, telling activists that: Next Spring, we will make Lloyds shares available to every member of the public. They\u2019ll be offered at a discount. Small shareholders will get priority, and long-term investors will get a bonus. You can register from today. It\u2019s the biggest privatisation for more than twenty years. And every penny we raise will be used to pay off our debts. So, with the Google tax row gathering pace, this is turning into a week to forget for the chancellor. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, warned two weeks ago that the Lloyds share sale was in trouble. He wrote: Under the drip-feed programme [sales to City firms], which has reduced the state\u2019s stake to 9%, sales are prohibited below 73.6p, the break-even price. And, if the drip-feed programme is stalled, can Osborne really go ahead with his parallel idea to exit Lloyds with a flourish this spring by selling \u00a32bn worth of discounted shares to the public? Technically, he can. But it would be highly embarrassing, politically speaking, to sell Lloyds shares to private punters at a loss to the public purse. At today\u2019s share price, the government would swallow a chunky loss if it carried on with the Lloyds sale. The break-even point, above which Osborne could boast a profit, is 73.6p. Lloyds shares are changing hands this morning at 63.9p. They haven\u2019t been above 74p since New Year\u2019s Eve 2015, before global stock markets began 2016 with hefty falls. Osborne has confirmed that the sale of Lloyds shares is off: It\u2019s all go today! Back in the UK, the chancellor has just announced that he\u2019s putting the sale of Lloyds Banking Group shares to the public on hold. He blames market turbulence. Britain acquired a 43% shareholding in Lloyds following the collapse of HBOS (now being freshly probed, of course). Osborne has managed to whittle it down to 9% 14% , and had hoped to shift the rest to the public soon. But Lloyds shares have shed a quarter of their value in the last eight months, and clearly the sale is no longer \u2018a goer\u2019. Q: These proposals still allow companies to shift profits to other EU, or non-EU countries. Won\u2019t that simply lead to a race to the bottom, as member states cut their corporation tax bills. We don\u2019t want to impose corporation tax at the national level, Pierre Moscovici reiterates. But there are also fiscal rules, public services to fund, which means countries cannot afford a race to the bottom. Q: And will you impose more punitive measures, if we don\u2019t see the \u20ac50bn-\u20ac70bn lost to tax evasion flooding into EU coffers. That\u2019s an official estimate, but we won\u2019t use it as a benchmark of success, Moscovici says. Q: Which countries are helping multinational companies avoid paying fair tax? Switzerland, perhaps? I was at Davos last week, says Moscovici. I met the new Swiss minister for finance, and we agreed that the excellent co-operation that exists between the EC and Switzerland would continue. A recent EC-Swiss agreement means that the banking secrecy no longer exists, and will aid the exchange of information, Moscovici adds. He doesn\u2019t want to point a finger at any countries, but wants to create a new system to prevent aggressive tax avoidance and boost transparency. Q: Would these EC\u2019s new proposals on tax avoidance stop legal arrangements such as Google, where the UK operations are carried out by a separate company working for Google in Dublin, who is paid a fee, to ensure the UK operations make as small a profit as possible? Moscovici says he can\u2019t talk directly about the Google deal. however. There are some measures inside our proposed directive that can address the issue. Especially exit taxation, to prevent companies relocating assets purely to avoid taxation. Q: How does this deal relate to the UK\u2019s controversial deal with Google, under which the search giant will pay \u00a3130m in back taxes? Pierre Moscovici says they aren\u2019t directly linked. The commission could investigate the UK\u2019s deal with Google, and the broad principle is that: All companies must pay their fair share of taxes, where they pay their profits. That\u2019s why we have been active in preventing member states ability to offer sweetheart deals. The measures I am announcing today will tackle the most common loopholes in international law, Moscovici insists. It should have a major impact in tackling aggressive tax planning. Q: Won\u2019t these new rules penalise countries a long way from the centre of Europe, who might struggle to attract firms without an attractive corporation ? (Ireland, perhaps) Moscovici says the EC isn\u2019t planning to set tax rates across the region. It\u2019s talking about common rules. Pierre Moscovici is taking questions now Q: How confidence is the EC that member states will accept new rules on tax? Moscovici says he expect a lively debate with national governments. He doesn\u2019t think his new plan will be accepted 100%, but he has \u201cevery confidence\u201d that new rules to combat tax avoidance will be agreed. Over in Brussels, European commissioner Pierre Moscovici is announcing a new crackdown on multinational companies\u2019 tax avoidance. Moscovici, Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and customs, is telling reporters that tax avoidance is a \u201cglobal problem\u201d. But the EC is determined to crack down on companies who play the system and cut their tax bills. It is \u201ctoo easy for companies to escape taxation by shifting assets to tax havens\u201d, Moscovici says, vowing to \u201cname and shame\u201d companies who don\u2019t play fair. The Commission is also keen to rein in member states who offer unfairly low tax rates to encourage multinationals to base their HQs there. Today we take action to put states on an equal footing, by setting legally binding rules that they must all abide by.....Member states must all apply a minimum level protection against tax avoidance. And he concludes: The days are numbered for companies who avoid paying tax at the expense of others. City regulators certainly haven\u2019t been quick-off-the mark on the HBOS scandal. Yes, HBOS bosses could potentially be banned from the City, but it\u2019s eight years since the bank was rescued by Lloyds Banking Group, who then required a massive taxpayer bailout. The decision to start investigating HBOS\u2019s former top managers is a significant moment. Until now, only one HBOS banker - Peter Cummings -- has been banned, even through a parliamentary inquiry blamed \u201ccolossal failure of management\u201d for its failure. Breaking news: Britain\u2019s City watchdogs have announced they are starting a probe into some of the top managers at HBOS, the bank which collapsed during the financial crisis. This statement just landed in my inbox: The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) have decided to start investigations into certain former HBOS senior managers. These investigations will determine whether or not any prohibition proceedings should be commenced against them. The FCA and PRA continue to review materials with a view to making further decisions regarding other former HBOS senior managers. The move comes two months after an official report into the HBOS affair was finally published. It concluded that the decision to not investigate at least 10 former executives was \u201cmaterially flawed\u201d. That list included chairman Lord Stevenson and chief executives Andy Hornby and James Crosby. Potentially, the FCA and the PRA could decide to ban former HBOS top executives from working in the City..... The GDP report shows that Britain\u2019s economy has suffered from the slump in oil prices in the last year: Britain\u2019s growth was \u201crelatively lacklustre\u201d and \u201cworryingly lopsided\u201d, warns Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight, an analyst group. It was completely dependent on the services sector, which saw output growth pick up to 0.7% quarter-on-quarter from 0.6% in the third quarter. There was marginal contraction in construction output (0.1% quarter-on-quarter) and industrial production (down 0.2%). Services is the only part of the UK economy that is larger than before 2008, when the financial crisis began. Quick clarification. Today\u2019s report shows that GDP was 1.9% higher in Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2015 compared with the same quarter a year ago. During 2015, the economy grew by 2.2%. That\u2019s a slowdown, as the UK grew by 2.6% during 2014. The chancellor tweets: Britain\u2019s economy has now posted 12 quarters of growth, and is estimated to be 6.6% higher than the pre- economic downturn peak in Q1 2008. This chart highlights how Britain relies on the service sector for growth (it does make up around 80% of the economy) Britain economy continues to rely on services company for growth, while manufacturers failed to grow. The ONS reports that: The service sector grew by 0.7% in the last quarter agriculture grew by 0.6% But the production sector shrank by 0.2%, with manufacturing output flat Construction decreased by 0.1% Here\u2019s Reuters first take on the GDP figures (they\u2019ve been in a lock-in at the Office for National Statistics): Britain\u2019s economy ended 2015 on a soft note after the annual pace of growth slowed to its weakest in nearly three years as the global economic slowdown weighed on its previously rapid expansion. Fourth-quarter gross domestic product grew by 0.5%, up slightly from 0.4% in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday, and in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. Output in the three months to December was 1.9% higher than a year earlier, down from 2.1% in the third quarter and the smallest increase since early 2013. The figures are likely to ease worries that Britain is facing a sharp economic slowdown, as domestic demand appears to have remained resilient. But they suggest that the robust growth of the past two years will not return until the world economy regains strength. Breaking! The UK economy grew by 0.5% in the final three months of 2015. That\u2019s up from 0.4% in the third quarter, and in line with expectations. But annual growth has slowed to 1.9% - the slowest in three years. More to follow.... Just 10 minutes to go until the GDP figures are released. Reminder: The City is expecting UK growth of 0.5% in the last quarter, with annual growth dipping to 1.9% Gross domestic product is a blunt tool for assessing a country\u2019s economy. Although it measures activity within an economy, GDP doesn\u2019t assess the actual value of that work. Burning down a rainforest and building a new railway are seen in the same way. And it doesn\u2019t measure inequality - whether the fruits of the economic success are shared fairly. This message has finally filtered through to the global elite at Davos last week, where IMF chief Christine Lagarde called for a shake-up. Lagarde told the World Economic Forum that: \u201cWe have to go back to GDP, the calculation of productivity, the value of things \u2013 in order to assess, and probably change, the way we look at the economy.\u201d Newsflash from Japan: the economy minister, Akira Amari, has announced his resignation. It follows allegations that he had received at least 12 million yen (about \u00a370,000) from a construction company, breaching political funding law. Amari, a key player in the stimulus programme spearheaded by prime minister Sinzo Abe, had denied wrong-doing. We\u2019ll be hearing from George Osborne shortly, flags up Sky News Faisal Islam. That may be a sign that today\u2019s growth figures is OK; the chancellor has a habit of being \u2018otherwise engaged\u2019 when there\u2019s bad news to discuss.... European markets are pretty calm this morning, as investors wait for the UK growth figures in 45 minutes time. The main indices are all up, a little, and oil is hovering around $33 per barrel. But Conner Campbell of SpreadEx warns that Britain\u2019s GDP report could spoil the mood: The upward movement from Brent Crude has caused a wave of green to overcome the UK index\u2019s crucial oil and mining stocks, in turn allowing the FTSE to flirt seriously with the 6000 mark for the first time in a fortnight. However, a major spanner in the works could be thrown in if the day\u2019s first look at the UK\u2019s fourth quarter GDP disappoints. Analysts are expecting 0.5%, marginally better than the 0.4% seen back in Q3; yet there is more than a chance that the figure might underperform, with the Chinese slowdown, Brexit fears AND those weaker than hoped for Christmas retail sales all swirling around to potentially take a point or two off the reading. Here\u2019s a round-up of today\u2019s other corporate news: Transport company FirstGroup warned profits would come in lower than expected. It blamed the recent wet weather and flooding in Britain and driver shortages in the US. Drinks giant Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker scotch and Smirnoff vodka, reported a 1.8% rise in first-half sales. It took a hit from foreign exchange rates and the sale of assets, including its wine business. Sweden\u2019s H&amp;M has also been hit by the strong dollar, which drove up its purchasing costs (it buys most of its clothes in Asia in US dollars), and warned that big markdowns on winter wear will hurt its profit margins in the first quarter. Like rivals, the world\u2019s second-biggest fashion retailer pointed to the unusually warm weather in many part of Europe and north America, which put customers off buying winter clothes. Jimmy Choo had a good 2015, as Asian shoppers snapped up its luxury shoes. It said strong demand in Asia, especially Japan, had countered the loss of Russian visitors at its European stores and the impact of the Paris terrorist attacks. Retail net revenues grew by 9% at constant exchange rates to \u00a3208m, contributing to 7% growth in overall revenues to \u00a3318m. But the price cut does not even come close to the drop in wholesale gas prices, consumer experts point out. Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis, founder of www.cheapenergyclub.co.uk, said: Baaaah. SSE has bleated and followed Eon\u2019s price cut last week, the rest of the big six sheep will likely soon follow. And again it\u2019s just a trivial 5% on gas only not electricity, nothing close to the drop in wholesale prices. Energy firms must be whooping for joy that they can get away with such small cuts and have the energy minister praising them, albeit slightly. Yet the real picture here is that even after cuts the vast majority of households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy. E.ON and SEE customers with typical usage on their standard tariffs will be paying at least \u00a31,050, after the cuts, and those from other firms even more. Yet the market\u2019s cheapest tariffs for switchers are around \u00a3770 a year on the same usage. And indeed both E.ON and SSE offer these for those who bother to switch.\u201d SSE, one of Britain\u2019s big six energy companies, will cut its domestic gas prices by an average of 5.3% \u2013 but not until after Easter. The company said: This latest reduction will save a typical household gas customer on our standard tariff \u00a332 a year compared with existing prices.\u201d The move, which takes effect on 29 March, comes a week after rival E.On reduced its gas prices by 5.1% from 1 February. SSE said it lost 300,000 customers in the first nine months of its financial year, as customers defected to smaller utility firms \u2013 part of a wider trend. Customer accounts dropped to 8.28m by 31 December. Even so, the company stuck to its full-year adjusted earnings per share target of 115p and said it would hike its dividend at least in line with retail price inflation. Some economists fear that UK growth slowed to just 0.3% in the last quarter, due to economic problems overseas and political uncertainty back home. Others predict a healthy pick-up in GDP. My colleague Katie Allen explains: Economists forecast that the figures will show growth of 0.5% in the final three months of 2015, slightly faster than growth of 0.4% in the previous quarter, according to the consensus in a Reuters poll. But with worries about China\u2019s downturn and the wider global economy clouding the outlook, there is significant uncertainty over the UK\u2019s performance. Individual economists\u2019 forecasts range from 0.3% to 0.6%. Weak retail sales figures for the key Christmas season There have also been warnings from businesses that the looming EU referendum is hurting confidence and forcing some firms to put investment plans on hold. With polls pointing to a tight vote, the pound has fallen sharply in recent weeks. Britain\u2019s place in the world.... Good morning. We\u2019re about to find out how well, or badly, Britain\u2019s economy fared in the last three months of 2015. Fresh GDP data for the October-December period is released at 9.30am. It will show how the UK performed during a time of growing worries about the global economy, and volatility in the markets. Economists predict that the UK economy expanded by around 0.5% during the quarter. That would be a small improvement on the 0.4% growth posted in July-September, and fairly unremarkable compared with long-term averages. But in the current climate, with China suffering a somewhat bumpy slowdown, any growth is better than nothing. The figures have global significance; Britain is the first major advance economy to report fourth-quarter GDP data. As we covered in last night\u2019s blog, the US central bank has said it\u2019s watching the global economy and the markets closely. And domestically, the data are another quarterly term card report for George Osborne, and his management of the economy. It\u2019s likely that service sector firms provided most of the growth, not the industrial sector that the chancellor hoped to reinvigorate. We\u2019ll be covering the build-up to the figures at 9.30am, and instant reaction and analysis once they are released.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne has postponed the sale of the last taxpayer-owned tranche of Lloyds Banking Group shares, blaming \u201cmarket turbulence\u201d. The chancellor pledged in last year\u2019s election manifesto to sell the remaining stake in the bank \u2013 just under 10% of the company \u2013 to the public this spring. However, he decided to delay the sale following the sharp sell-off in stock markets in recent weeks. The sale will not happen until after Easter, it is understood. Osborne said: \u201cI want to create a share-owning democracy. It\u2019s also my responsibility to ensure economic responsibility, so with these turbulent financial markets, now is not the right time to have that sale. \u201cWe will sell Lloyds to the British people, but we will do so when the time is right.\u201d Several indices, including London\u2019s leading share index, entered bear market territory last week. There was panic selling as crude oil prices fell to fresh 13-year lows and investors fretted about China\u2019s economic slowdown and the state of the global economy. The FTSE 100 index has recovered this week and hit a three-week high of 6012.4 on Thursday before falling back again; global equity markets remain volatile. The Lloyds share price has fallen to 64p, well below the government\u2019s average purchase price of 73.6p, above which it would make a profit. In October, when Osborne set out details of the Lloyds sale, the shares were trading at nearly 78p, but the price fell towards the end of the year as investors became concerned about the global economy. A successful sale of the shares at a 5% discount to the reduced price, as planned, would have been criticised as a politically unacceptable giveaway to those with money to invest. But if the shares fell sharply after the sale due to rocky markets, that could also have proved politically damaging for Osborne. The cut-price sale, to hundreds of thousands of retail investors, was expected to raise \u00a32bn and was billed as the \u201cbiggest privatisation for 20 years\u201d. In the 1980s, BT and British Gas were sold for nearly \u00a34bn and \u00a35.6bn. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThis will be a big disappointment for the hundreds of thousands of investors who had queued up for a chunk of Lloyds, but taking a big loss on selling shares when markets are low was always going to be a bridge too far for the chancellor. \u201cThe fall in the Lloyds share price has left them about 10p below what the government thinks it needs to break even, and together with the planned 5% discount and bonus share scheme would have meant the chancellor putting his hand in his pocket, so now he looks to be pinning his hopes on a recovery in markets later in the year.\u201d The planned sale appeared in question when Lloyds shares ended 2015 at 73.07p after dipping as low as 68p in December, although they traded above the break-even point at certain times during the month. The postponement is yet another reversal on a manifesto pledge, following Osborne\u2019s change of heart over tax credit cuts in the autumn statement. Lloyds Banking Group noted that the government had progressively reduced its stake in the group from 43% to 9%, returning more than \u00a316bn to taxpayers at a profit. A spokesman said: \u201cThis reflects the hard work undertaken over the past four years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank. \u201cThe timing of any future retail sale is a matter for the government. Our focus is on moving the group forward so that it can continue to be profitable and deliver sustainable returns to all our shareholders.\u201d Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said: \u201c[The chancellor] won\u2019t want any issue that was aiming for substantial involvement from private investors to be a flop. That would damage already fragile sentiment and make it harder for any future privatisations to do well. \u201cInvestors will also note that it is not just Lloyds\u2019 share price that is struggling \u2013 all banks are floundering. Bank sector indices in the UK, Europe and USA are all trading at their 12-month lows.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s economy picked up pace at the end of 2015 but GDP growth for the year as a whole was down markedly, as both the manufacturing and construction sectors struggled with an uncertain outlook. Official figures published on Thursday showed GDP expanded 0.5% in final three months of 2015, up from 0.4% growth in the previous quarter and in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. On a year earlier, GDP was up 1.9%, after growing an annual 2.1% in the third quarter. This latest quarter marks the slowest annual expansion rate since early 2013. For 2015 as a whole, GDP growth was 2.2%, down from 2.9% in 2014. The pound strengthened against the dollar after the data met market expectations. Some economists had warned in recent days that GDP growth could come in softer against the backdrop of a global economic slowdown, a downturn in China and turmoil on financial markets which have seen oil prices plunge in recent months. Services drive growth The details behind the GDP figures are likely to fan fears about the unabalanced nature of the UK\u2019s economy, with the services sector being relied upon again for growth in the latest quarter. Commenting on the figures, ONS chief economist Joe Grice said: \u201cGrowth continues to be driven by the UK\u2019s dominant services sector, while the production and construction sectors shrank slightly in the fourth quarter.\u201d Chris Williamson, chief economist at the data company Markit which compiles surveys of UK businesses, said the outlook remained tough for the UK. \u201cThe upturn masks an unbalanced economy and a slowing pace of expansion, with the annual rate of growth slipping to the weakest for almost three years. Survey data also point to a further loss of momentum in December,\u201d he said. \u201cUncertainty over \u2018Brexit\u2019, weak overseas growth and financial market volatility are all creating an unsettling business environment and point to downside risks to the economy in 2016.\u201d The official figures follow mixed reports on the economy in recent weeks. Christmas retail sales figures disappointed, manufacturers have been showing signs of struggling with tough export markets and construction output has dipped. There have also been warnings from businesses that the looming EU referendum is hurting confidence and forcing some firms to put investment plans on hold. Chancellor George Osborne said in a Tweet that the latest figures showed the UK \u201ccontinues to grow steadily\u201d but warned that with \u201cturbulence\u201d in the world, \u201cthere may be bumpy times ahead\u201d. The Bank of England has indicated it will keep interest rates at their record low of 0.5% for many months to come after signs the economy lost steam in recent months and as low oil prices have kept inflation close to zero. Policymakers say low oil prices, which recently hit a 13-year trough, should support the UK economy by boosting consumer spending. There were signs of such a fillip in a survey of UK retailers on Thursday. Retail sales growth was broadly steady over the year to January, beating retailers\u2019 expectations for a slight slowdown, according to the poll of 126 companies by business group CBI. Sales were considered to be well above average for the time of year but the outlook was less upbeat. Orders placed on suppliers fell over the year at the fastest pace since May 2013 and sales growth is predicted to slow next month. CBI director of economics, Rain Newton-Smith, commented: \u201cWith competition remaining fierce and persistent price deflation in the sector, it\u2019s not surprising the outlook for retailers in February looks subdued. \u201cMild weather looks to have hit clothing sales, but current low oil prices continue to support consumer spending.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The six brokers found not guilty of helping Tom Hayes rig Libor interest rates have said their trial was a sham and they were made scapegoats, in heavy criticism of the Serious Fraud Office\u2019s handling of the investigation. They spoke outside Southwark crown court after Darrell Read was found not guilty of the one outstanding count against the brokers, meaning they have all been cleared. The jury returned a majority verdict of not guilty against Read, prompting cheers from the other five men, who were in court supporting him a day after they were cleared. The other brokers were Danny Wilkinson and Colin Goodman, who worked at Icap with Read; Noel Cryan, formerly of Tullett Prebon; and Jim Gilmour and Terry Farr of RP Martin. They were accused of helping the former UBS and Citigroup trader Hayes, who is serving 11 years in prison, to rig Libor. Cryan said: \u201cIt has turned our lives upside down. Realistically, we should never have been here. We feel we\u2019ve been scapegoated. There are things to be answered but we are not the ones who should be answering them.\u201d Read said the case had been a sham and that the SFO \u201cdidn\u2019t investigate it properly and didn\u2019t listen\u201d.The brokers celebrated the verdict by heading to the local pub. Their trial lasted four months but the jury was out for less than a day before announcing the verdicts. The men, whose nicknames included \u201cLord Libor\u201d and \u201cBig Nose\u201d, were accused of acting as go-betweens by passing around requests from traders and being paid extra commission by Hayes. Libor is the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other. It underpins trillions of pounds worth of contracts, from mortgages to corporate lending. Nick Hayes, the father of Tom Hayes, applauded the verdict and said the SFO\u2019s investigation had been a shambles. The verdict raises the prospect of Hayes appealing his sentence. In a series of posts on Twitter, Nick Hayes said: \u201cToday Tom Hayes stands tall. He refused to testify versus the Libor brokers and paid the price, while they\u2019re back with the [sic] family. I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d \u201cIn conspiracy to defraud prosecution must first prove \u2018agreement\u2019 between conspirators. Where now Tom Hayes, who must\u2019ve agreed only with himself? I strongly believe fraudsters should be behind bars. Lets start with the SFO who defrauded the UK taxpayer of millions of pounds in the Libor shambles.\u201d A spokesman for the SFO confirmed the agency will not appeal the verdicts. David Green, the SFO director, said: \u201cThe key issue in this trial was whether these defendants were party to a dishonest agreement with Tom Hayes. By their verdicts the jury have said that they could not be sure that this was the case. Nobody could sensibly suggest that these charges should not have been brought and considered by a jury.\u201d A new Libor-related trial involving a group of former Barclays traders is scheduled to begin in February. The SFO is also pursuing six individuals for allegedly rigging Euribor, the European equivalent of Libor. The jurors were told by the judge only to convict the six brokers if evidence showed that they played a \u201csignificant\u201d role in helping Hayes rig Libor. \u201cYou would need to be satisfied that any involvement was not minimal or merely transitory, but something which establishes significant involvement in the continuing conspiracy,\u201d Judge Nicholas Hamblen said. Lawyers said that the SFO had been hindered in securing prosecutions because the British legal system meant it was difficult to pursue companies as opposed to individual employees. Alison McHaffie, a partner with law firm CMS, said: \u201cApart from being acutely embarrassing to the SFO, these verdicts show how difficult it is to demonstrate criminal activity by individuals for this type of type of market misconduct. \u201cIt is always easier to bring regulatory action rather than criminal prosecution against the firms themselves. In future, the regulator will find it easier to pursue disciplinary actions against individuals for wrongdoing.\u201d Matthew Frankland, the solicitor for Wilkinson, said: \u201cUltimately, there is a hypocrisy in charging brokers. Brokers do not work for banks, they play no part in the Libor submission process and are not and never were regulated by the BBA in relation to their Libor predictions. \u201cThe case also further highlights that, yet again, most of the individuals prosecuted in the Libor cases are relatively junior within the different organisations, with more senior people not being held to account.\u201d David James, the solicitor for Goodman, who was known as Lord Libor, added: \u201cWe can only reiterate what his counsel told the jury, that the SFO case was a complete shambles and should never have been brought.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Last summer, a brief recovery in the manufacturing sector was already running out of steam. The construction sector followed the same path. Affected by a slowdown in global trade, the high value of the pound, and possibly the government\u2019s determination to impose another five years of austerity, businesses became more circumspect about expanding output. Now, official figures for GDP growth in the final three months of 2015 show that these backbone of the economy activities, the stuff of making and building things, actually shrank. While manufacturing accounts for little more than 10% of the economy, and construction about 7%, they are vital elements. The chancellor, George Osborne, promised a march of the makers. It hasn\u2019t happened. In fact, the manufacturing sector\u2019s output remains well below its pre-crash peak. Should we worry? Of course we should. Osborne might welcome growth wherever it comes from. But if the source is the residential property sector, where a return to buying, selling and buoyant lending means the pace of price rises is three times that of wages, then the economy is like a listing ship. It might still be moving ahead, but not all the engines are in the water and even a modest wave could knock it over. Osborne has largely given up on an increase in corporation tax receipts over the next five years \u2013 Google is just one element of that surrender \u2013 but he expects receipts from stamp duty on property to soar between now and 2020, as prices continue to outstrip wages. The other element of growth, highlighted by Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, in a recent speech, has been the increase in GDP that relates to immigrants. A net figure of more than 330,000 last year increases the size of the economic pie and the number of people wanting a slice. It will be interesting as the year wears on how much Britain\u2019s GDP per capita increases. The betting must be not much. Osborne is gambling that the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which will come into force in April, cheers up the low paid, while rock-bottom interest rates please middle-income families. He might be right. It\u2019s just that his constant tactical manoeuvring is storing up a whole heap of trouble.",

      "bodyText": "European Union authorities in Brussels have reiterated their readiness to investigate the British government\u2019s tax deal with Google, following the launch of a wider crackdown on so-called sweetheart arrangements. Pierre Moscovici, Europe\u2019s most senior tax policy official, said: \u201cThe commission will investigate the UK deal with Google if the need arises. However, the commission is clear that all companies must pay their fair share of taxes where they earn their profits.\u201d Moscovici, a former French finance minister, was speaking at the launch of a wide-ranging plan aimed at tackling corporate tax avoidance and sweetheart deals cooked up between companies and \u201cavoidance-friendly\u201d EU governments. The plan aims to close down the main tax loopholes that have helped multinational companies avoid billions in corporation tax. Hours earlier, his colleague in charge of EU competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, said EU authorities could investigate the British government\u2019s deal with Google. Catherine Bearder, a Liberal Democrat MEP, said she had tabled an urgent written question to the commission calling for an EU investigation into the Google arrangement. \u201cMore transparency is needed across Europe to end these cosy deals and ensure multinationals pay their fair share,\u201d Bearder said. \u201cOnly by working together in Europe can we stamp out tax avoidance and get a better deal for British taxpayers.\u201d EU scrutiny of the Google deal will add to the pressure on David Cameron, who has been accused of allowing the internet company to hold too much sway over his government, with critics ranging from the former business secretary Vince Cable to the media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. The intervention by two of the most powerful economic policymakers in Europe is part of the EU\u2019s two-fold attack on aggressive tax avoidance by multinationals. Vestager is examining whether the Irish government\u2019s tax treatment of Apple amounts to illegal subsidies, and has also launched inquiries into Gazprom and Amazon. Moscovici has embarked on an overhaul of EU tax law as part of an effort to stop companies hiding profits in tax havens. Moscovici said the EU was restricting member states\u2019 ability to offer sweetheart deals, citing Vestager\u2019s state aid work and his transparency measures. \u201cThe days are numbered for companies that avoid paying tax at the expense of others,\u201d he said, citing research that aggressive tax avoidance costs the EU between \u20ac50bn-\u20ac70bn (\u00a338bn-\u00a353bn) a year. This is the equivalent of Bulgaria\u2019s GDP and five times more than the EU spent on the refugee crisis in 2015, he said. Without naming names, the EU commissioner said some member states had \u201cmore avoidance friendly regimes [where] it is too easy for companies to lower their tax bills\u201d. The commission is seeking to close the most commonly used tax loopholes, such as the practice of setting up a subsidiary in a non-European tax haven, which is used to pay dividends back to the European parent company that are not subject to tax. Companies will no longer be able to shift profitable intellectual property that has been mostly developed in Europe to a low-tax jurisdiction to avoid paying tax. There will be a catch-all anti-abuse rule empowering governments to close down new loopholes devised by creative accountants. Moscovici said he was seeking to revive plans for corporations to file a single European tax form, regarded by officials as a vital step in preventing companies from funnelling profits to EU member states with more lax, less transparent tax systems. The idea \u2013 known in tax jargon as common consolidated corporate tax base \u2013 would mean that companies face a single set of rules across the EU, although member states would still be free to set their own corporate tax rates. The UK has long opposed CCCTB, as successive Labour and Conservative governments have jealously guarded national powers on tax. Ireland, another long-standing opponent, has traditionally seen the measures as a strike against its 12.5% corporate tax rate, one of the lowest in the EU. Moscovici said he was ready to pursue the idea, as the commission\u2019s latest approach \u201ccould reduce the reluctance of some member states\u201d. All tax plans have to be agreed by all 28 EU member states, prompting fears that they could be watered down. Moscovici expects countries will sign up to his anti-avoidance plan by the summer, far faster than the usual EU legislative process. He said he was optimistic because EU governments had already signed up to a non-binding version of the plan through the OECD. He thinks public pressure will help: \u201cMember states today are conscious of the demand from public opinion.\u201d Not everyone shares this view. Markus Ferber, a German centre-right MEP, who has campaigned against tax avoidance, said he was concerned that EU countries would dilute the tax-avoidance plan, citing an agreement on a tax transparency directive last December that he sees as limited. \u201cThey adopted something to say they did something, but in reality it does not change anything at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is my experience, so I am pessimistic [about the latest proposals].\u201d",

That slowdown came against the backdrop of a waning global economy. </p> <p>After the latest bout of turmoil on financial markets and with the UK gearing up for a referendum on EU membership, here is how economists and commentators reacted to the GDP figures released on Thursday and how they see the year ahead.</p> <h2><strong>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the difficult international background, it is not surprising that the UK failed to sustain the more impressive economic growth seen in 2014. Services remains the main driver of the economy, while production and construction are down.</p> <p>The GDP figures demonstrate that the recovery remains fragile. While the services sector continues to grow, production is close to stagnation and the construction sector is now in recession. Every effort must be made to support both these sectors as we seek to rebalance the economy.</p> </blockquote> <h2>John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Despite some global headwinds, the UK economy continued to deliver solid growth of 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015, close to its long-term trend rate. As in previous quarters, this reflected the strength of domestic demand and private services sectors, while manufacturing and construction output were broadly flat.</p> <p>Looking ahead, strong job creation, low energy prices and positive real income growth should keep consumer spending growth at a decent rate of about 2.5% in 2016. This should allow the UK economy as a whole to deliver continued steady growth of just over 2% this year, despite recent financial market volatility. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Manufacturing ended the year on a flat note, rounding off a disappointing year for the sector. However, the picture remains very much a sectoral story, with those sectors exposed to oil and gas struggling, while those consumer facing, such as automotive, are faring much better on the back of a healthy labour market and strong wage growth. </p> <p>While we expect the sector to grow this year, the risks are mounting. Along with the oil price remaining low, slower growth in emerging markets, especially China, is likely to hamper export prospects.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EEF_Economists/statuses/692652980349358080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our Deputy Chief Economist Zach Witton comments on today&#39;s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GDP?src=hash\">#GDP</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/manufacturing?src=hash\">#manufacturing</a> figures from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ONS\">@ONS</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ukmfg?src=hash\">#ukmfg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/XflbvV73sD\">pic.twitter.com/XflbvV73sD</a></p>&mdash; EEF Economics Team (@EEF_Economists) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EEF_Economists/status/692652980349358080\">January 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After volatility in the financial markets during the first few weeks of the year, these GDP figures should settle nerves about the health of the real economy. Growth of 0.5% a quarter is far from remarkable, but with services continuing to power the recovery, and housebuilding expected to undergo something of a revival as the year progresses, this expansion looks sustainable.</p> <p>Across the economy, high levels of debt remain a concern \u2013 especially at this point in the cycle. This debt bubble can still be deflated with effective monetary policy, and it would be wise to take action before it becomes unmanageable.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The upturn masks an unbalanced economy and a slowing pace of expansion, with the annual rate of growth slipping to the weakest for almost three years. Survey data also point[s] to a further loss of momentum in December. </p> <p>Uncertainty over \u2018Brexit\u2019, weak overseas growth and financial market volatility are all creating an unsettling business environment and point to downside risks to the economy in 2016. The coming year could easily see the pace of economic growth slow further from last year\u2019s 2.2% expansion, and the chances are growing that we will see yet another year in which interest rates are left at their record low of 0.5%.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/statuses/692652962448039937\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UK GDP +0.5% in Q4, but driven (once again) entirely by services according to ONS <a href=\"https://t.co/dxJHKsitv5\">pic.twitter.com/dxJHKsitv5</a></p>&mdash; Chris Williamson (@WilliamsonChris) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/status/692652962448039937\">January 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>Vicky Redwood, c</strong>hief UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The figures mean that GDP in 2015 as a whole rose by 2.2% \u2013 respectable, but still a fairly significant slowdown from 2014\u2019s 2.9% rate. And the economy faces a number of headwinds this year, potentially including the EU referendum and rising inflation and interest rates. So we doubt that we will see a strong pick-up in growth this year. Nonetheless, we don\u2019t expect a further slowdown either. And we are still more optimistic than most about the prospects for growth next year.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconUK/statuses/692646911485054976\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sub-trend growth suggests one of Carney&#39;s conditions for rate rise - growth set to use up remaining slack - not met <a href=\"https://t.co/ckqWdvfLiE\">pic.twitter.com/ckqWdvfLiE</a></p>&mdash; Capital Economics (@CapEconUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CapEconUK/status/692646911485054976\">January 28, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s a big concern how fragile the recovery still looks, and how unbalanced it is, with growth almost entirely dependent on services.</p> <p>We need a stronger recovery that\u2019s built to last and that reaches all sectors of the economy. The weakness of manufacturing and construction is no surprise given the government\u2019s lack of a proper industrial policy to boost the economy and protect crucial industries such as steel.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Adam Chester, head of economic research at Lloyds Bank commercial banking</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This morning\u2019s UK GDP figures provide a timely counterweight to some of the recent economic pessimism ... Although this was in line with median expectations, given the singular focus on the downside risks in recent weeks, many in the market were no doubt braced for a weaker outturn.</p> <p>Today\u2019s data provides welcome confirmation that the economy continued to grow broadly in line with its trend. It remains to be seen whether this resilience can be maintained in the wake of the recent market turmoil. Given the strength of the labour market, exceptionally loose monetary conditions and the positive impact on consumer and business spending of the fall in oil prices, we believe it will.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>Scott Corfe, d</strong>irector at the <strong>Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr)</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The outlook for the UK in 2016 remains fragile and we expect a slowdown in growth compared with last year. The public could easily vote to leave the European Union in a referendum later this year, if the latest opinion polls give an accurate picture of voting intention.</p> <p>While the longer term implications of \u2018Brexit\u2019 are debatable and depend on a wide range of factors, the short-term implications would undoubtedly be messy. If Brexit happens, Cebr envisions a sharp fall in the value of sterling, as well as further volatility in other financial markets. There would also be negative impacts on overseas demand for property and foreign direct investment \u2013 in the short term at least.</p> <p>Other risks to growth include a worsening global economic slowdown, which would further curb demand for UK exports, and the prospect of the property market (especially in London) losing momentum following the new stamp duty surcharge on second purchases, such as buy-to-let investments.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for most of the year and help sustain or even accelerate consumer credit growth \u2013 already at decade highs \u2013 and boost consumption. </p> <p>In addition, consumer confidence remains elevated and stable, with the negative effects of continuing economic and financial market turbulence being offset by record high employment levels and continued increases in house prices. Finally, further falls in the price of oil and strong competition in the supermarket sector are driving down the cost of basic necessities such as food and oil, freeing up household income to spend on other goods and services. </p> <p>Taken together, these are a significant tailwind for domestic demand. As such, we expect the domestic-oriented services sector, which accounts for about 80% of GDP, to maintain a consistent pace of healthy growth throughout 2016. </p> </blockquote>",

After the latest bout of turmoil on financial markets and with the UK gearing up for a referendum on EU membership, here is how economists and commentators reacted to the GDP figures released on Thursday and how they see the year ahead. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce Given the difficult international background, it is not surprising that the UK failed to sustain the more impressive economic growth seen in 2014. Services remains the main driver of the economy, while production and construction are down. The GDP figures demonstrate that the recovery remains fragile. While the services sector continues to grow, production is close to stagnation and the construction sector is now in recession. Every effort must be made to support both these sectors as we seek to rebalance the economy. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC Despite some global headwinds, the UK economy continued to deliver solid growth of 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015, close to its long-term trend rate. As in previous quarters, this reflected the strength of domestic demand and private services sectors, while manufacturing and construction output were broadly flat. Looking ahead, strong job creation, low energy prices and positive real income growth should keep consumer spending growth at a decent rate of about 2.5% in 2016. This should allow the UK economy as a whole to deliver continued steady growth of just over 2% this year, despite recent financial market volatility. Zach Witton, deputy chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation Manufacturing ended the year on a flat note, rounding off a disappointing year for the sector. However, the picture remains very much a sectoral story, with those sectors exposed to oil and gas struggling, while those consumer facing, such as automotive, are faring much better on the back of a healthy labour market and strong wage growth. While we expect the sector to grow this year, the risks are mounting. Along with the oil price remaining low, slower growth in emerging markets, especially China, is likely to hamper export prospects. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors After volatility in the financial markets during the first few weeks of the year, these GDP figures should settle nerves about the health of the real economy. Growth of 0.5% a quarter is far from remarkable, but with services continuing to power the recovery, and housebuilding expected to undergo something of a revival as the year progresses, this expansion looks sustainable. Across the economy, high levels of debt remain a concern \u2013 especially at this point in the cycle. This debt bubble can still be deflated with effective monetary policy, and it would be wise to take action before it becomes unmanageable. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit The upturn masks an unbalanced economy and a slowing pace of expansion, with the annual rate of growth slipping to the weakest for almost three years. Survey data also point[s] to a further loss of momentum in December. Uncertainty over \u2018Brexit\u2019, weak overseas growth and financial market volatility are all creating an unsettling business environment and point to downside risks to the economy in 2016. The coming year could easily see the pace of economic growth slow further from last year\u2019s 2.2% expansion, and the chances are growing that we will see yet another year in which interest rates are left at their record low of 0.5%. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics The figures mean that GDP in 2015 as a whole rose by 2.2% \u2013 respectable, but still a fairly significant slowdown from 2014\u2019s 2.9% rate. And the economy faces a number of headwinds this year, potentially including the EU referendum and rising inflation and interest rates. So we doubt that we will see a strong pick-up in growth this year. Nonetheless, we don\u2019t expect a further slowdown either. And we are still more optimistic than most about the prospects for growth next year. Frances O\u2019Grady, TUC general secretary It\u2019s a big concern how fragile the recovery still looks, and how unbalanced it is, with growth almost entirely dependent on services. We need a stronger recovery that\u2019s built to last and that reaches all sectors of the economy. The weakness of manufacturing and construction is no surprise given the government\u2019s lack of a proper industrial policy to boost the economy and protect crucial industries such as steel. Adam Chester, head of economic research at Lloyds Bank commercial banking This morning\u2019s UK GDP figures provide a timely counterweight to some of the recent economic pessimism ... Although this was in line with median expectations, given the singular focus on the downside risks in recent weeks, many in the market were no doubt braced for a weaker outturn. Today\u2019s data provides welcome confirmation that the economy continued to grow broadly in line with its trend. It remains to be seen whether this resilience can be maintained in the wake of the recent market turmoil. Given the strength of the labour market, exceptionally loose monetary conditions and the positive impact on consumer and business spending of the fall in oil prices, we believe it will. Scott Corfe, director at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) The outlook for the UK in 2016 remains fragile and we expect a slowdown in growth compared with last year. The public could easily vote to leave the European Union in a referendum later this year, if the latest opinion polls give an accurate picture of voting intention. While the longer term implications of \u2018Brexit\u2019 are debatable and depend on a wide range of factors, the short-term implications would undoubtedly be messy. If Brexit happens, Cebr envisions a sharp fall in the value of sterling, as well as further volatility in other financial markets. There would also be negative impacts on overseas demand for property and foreign direct investment \u2013 in the short term at least. Other risks to growth include a worsening global economic slowdown, which would further curb demand for UK exports, and the prospect of the property market (especially in London) losing momentum following the new stamp duty surcharge on second purchases, such as buy-to-let investments. Kallum Pickering, senior UK economist at Berenberg Monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for most of the year and help sustain or even accelerate consumer credit growth \u2013 already at decade highs \u2013 and boost consumption. In addition, consumer confidence remains elevated and stable, with the negative effects of continuing economic and financial market turbulence being offset by record high employment levels and continued increases in house prices. Finally, further falls in the price of oil and strong competition in the supermarket sector are driving down the cost of basic necessities such as food and oil, freeing up household income to spend on other goods and services. Taken together, these are a significant tailwind for domestic demand. As such, we expect the domestic-oriented services sector, which accounts for about 80% of GDP, to maintain a consistent pace of healthy growth throughout 2016.",

The bank said more than 1,000 new customers were joining it each day, while 6.8% of all UK consumers switching or opening a new account were joining TSB, beating its own target of 6%. However, management profit, which removes the distortion of one-off and volatile items, came in at \u00a3105.7m for 2015, representing a decrease of 21% on the previous year. The TSB chief executive, Paul Pester, who has led the organisation first through a flotation after it was spun off from Lloyds and then through the sale to the new Spanish parent, said the bank was \u201cabsolutely on track\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not about focusing on short-term profit,\u201d he added, saying the bank had decided to invest in a number of great properties while \u201cencouraging new customers to come to us\u201d.

    "webTitle": "Google agrees to face grilling from MPs on 'sweetheart' tax deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Google executives and UK tax officials are to face a grilling from MPs within weeks after they agreed to appear before the Commons public accounts committee to discuss their tax settlement. Representatives from the US internet company and HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) are due to give evidence in a hearing on 11 February, the committee confirmed. Google was given an extremely rough time by the committee in 2013 when Margaret Hodge, the committee\u2019s then chair, subverted the company slogan \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d, claiming that its tax strategies meant \u201cyou do do evil\u201d. The committee is now chaired by the Labour MP Meg Hillier. The government\u2019s tax deal with Google could fall foul of European competition rules and will be investigated if a complaint is made, the European commissioner responsible for the rules has said. Margrethe Vestager said so-called \u201csweetheart deals\u201d between member states and companies were unfair and could amount to illegal state aid. The SNP has already written to Vestager calling for a European commission investigation into Google\u2019s tax settlement, and Labour is expected to make a similar complaint. Meanwhile, tax authorities in Italy could formally notify Google on Thursday that it is being investigated for allegedly avoiding \u20ac300m in taxes over five years from 2008, La Repubblica newspaper reported. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme about the UK government\u2019s \u00a3130m deal with Google on back taxes, Vestager said: \u201cThat\u2019s way too early to say because I don\u2019t know the details of the deal.\u201d Asked whether she would investigate, Vestager said: \u201cIf we find that there is something to be concerned about, if someone writes to us and says \u2018maybe this is not as it should be\u2019, then we will take a look.\u201d She added: \u201cWe should be in a union where everyone has a fair chance of making it. If you are in a small innovative company \u2026 the bigger ones shouldn\u2019t close the market and disable your opportunity to find customers.\u201d Vestager\u2019s remarks will add to the mounting pressure on David Cameron, whose government has been accused of being too close to Google. Stewart Hosie, the SNP\u2019s Westminster spokesman on the economy and deputy leader of the party, said: \u201cThere is a palpable sense of scepticism amongst the public, experts and even within the Conservative party, that the tax settlement reached with Google represents value for the taxpayer. \u201cThe truth is that we know very little about the settlement reached between the tax authorities and the company. These discussions have taken place in private, little detail has been revealed by the Treasury and the methodologies employed by HMRC are shrouded in secrecy.\u201d Hodge, who brought the issue of Google\u2019s tax bill to national attention in 2013, told Today: \u201cI think the European commissioner should have a look at it. It is a question of fairness.\u201d On Wednesday the former cabinet minister Vince Cable and the media mogul Rupert Murdoch voiced concerns that Cameron and George Osborne had allowed the technology giant to hold too much sway. On Thursday the European commission announced new measures to prevent tax avoidance by companies across the EU. Setting out the aims of the measures, Vestager said: \u201cHopefully we will end up in a situation where companies pay taxes in the countries where they also make their profits. These new proposals will take us another step down that road.\u201d Vestager has been chairing an inquiry on whether Apple should pay hundreds of billions of euro in back taxes after channelling profits through Ireland. Vestager said it was \u201cway, way too early to conclude on that case\u201d. But she set out the commission\u2019s general stance on tax breaks. \u201cJust as it is illegal to give a selective advantage in the form of a grant, it is as illegal to give a selective benefit by saying \u2018you don\u2019t have to pay your taxes\u2019, because two companies may compete door-to-door for the same customers, more or less on the same products on price, quality, service. \u201cIf one company doesn\u2019t pay the taxes then obviously this company has a stronger position in that competition. That\u2019s why we can use state-aid tools to look for more individual companies and more selective advantages being given out in the form of tax rulings.\u201d Vestager defended a private meeting she had last week with Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook. She said: \u201cIt is important for anyone who has a case with us to be able to state their [view] and then of course we listen \u2026 This is a union built on the rule of law. Every company, when they have a case, has the full right of defending themselves, presenting their arguments, their facts of the case.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m here to do a job for all Europeans. For all the companies who pay their taxes, for all the Europeans who pay their taxes.\u201d Italy\u2019s financial police said they could not confirm figures contained in the Repubblica report. There have been reports this week about a possible settlement with Google after a long-running inquiry into its tax affairs. \u201cGoogle complies with the tax laws in every country where we operate. We continue to work with the relevant authorities,\u201d Google in Italy said. A source close to Google said the group had not yet received any official notice from prosecutors or other authorities. Google paid about \u20ac2.2m in taxes in Italy on official sales of \u20ac54.4m, according to publicly available accounts. However, the true revenue figure is thought by government officials to be far higher. The company \u2013 like other internet groups in Italy that pay low taxes \u2013 has publicly claimed that its activities in Italy are limited to marketing and consulting services in connection to its European headquarters in Ireland.",

      "bodyText": "SSE is to cut its household gas price by 5.3% from late March, becoming the second of the UK\u2019s big six energy suppliers to change its tariff following the collapse in commodity prices. Britain\u2019s energy watchdog welcomed the move but called for further price reductions in the sector, while consumer experts branded SSE\u2019s price cut as \u201ctrivial\u201d and a \u201cfig leaf\u201d to appease the media and politicians. Dermot Nolan, chief executive of Ofgem, said: \u201cThis is a move in the right direction, but, if the market is as competitive as suppliers claim, we would expect to see further price cuts. Ofgem referred the market to the Competition and Markets Authority because we feel competition is not bearing down fast or hard enough on consumers\u2019 bills.\u201d The price cut, which comes after SSE lost 300,000 customers to smaller rivals, will be introduced from 29 March and follows rival gas supplier E.ON\u2019s 5.1% reduction last week. SSE said it will save a typical gas customer on a standard tariff \u00a332 a year. UK energy companies have faced repeated calls to reduce their gas prices after months of falling wholesale costs. SSE\u2019s price cut was praised by Amber Rudd, the secretary of state for energy and climate change, as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d. However, consumer experts were less impressed. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said the reduction did not even come close to matching the decline in wholesale costs. He said: \u201cAgain it\u2019s just a trivial 5% on gas only, not electricity, nothing close to the drop in wholesale prices. Energy firms must be whooping for joy that they can get away with such small cuts. The real picture here is that even after cuts the vast majority of households in the UK are massively overpaying for their energy.\u201d Lewis said E.ON and SEE customers with typical usage on their standard tariffs will be paying at least \u00a31,050 a year after the cuts, and those from other firms even more. He said the cheapest tariffs, often offered by smaller firms, are around \u00a3770 a year on the same usage. \u201cAnd indeed both E.ON and SSE offer these for those who bother to switch,\u201d he added. Customers are already voting with their feet: SSE lost 300,000 customers in the first nine months of its financial year, as many defected to smaller utility firms \u2013 part of a wider trend. Customer accounts dropped to 8.28 m by 31 December. Even so, the company stuck to its full-year adjusted earnings per share target of 115p and said it would raise its dividend at least in line with retail price inflation. James Padmore, head of energy at comparison site comparethemarket.com, described the cut as a \u201cBig Six fig leaf\u201d.\u201cThe cut merely scratches the surface \u2013 \u00a332 a year is not much considering people stand to save on average \u00a3336 a year by changing to the cheapest dual fuel tariff. \u201cThis round of cuts are a clear attempt to stop the rot,\u201d he added, referring to SSE\u2019s customer losses. SSE\u2019s price cut will not take effect until after Easter, but the company said it comes three months before its current price freeze ends. In March 2014, the group pledged to keep energy prices on hold until the end of June 2016. Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of the Perth-based utility, said it had also achieved a \u201csignificant reduction in the number and duration of power cuts experienced by our networks customers\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "McDonald\u2019s is attempting to reverse its sagging fortunes in Japan with the launch this week of a new menu item: french fries smothered in chocolate sauce. While the combination of deep-fried potato and sugary condiment is unlikely to impress dieticians, the fast-food chain\u2019s Japan unit is hoping the arrival of McChoco Potatoes will counteract a slew of bad news about its performance in the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. While McDonald\u2019s reported a 5.7% rise in US in the last three months of 2015, as well as plans to open another 60 stores in Russia this year, its Japanese sales have been hit by a series of food scandals and supply issues. In late 2014, the firm was forced to restrict sales of fries after industrial action at US ports affected shipments of thousands of tonnes of the chain\u2019s staple accompaniment to a burger to Japan. Earlier the same year, officials in China closed down the firm\u2019s poultry supplier amid allegations that it had deliberately mixed fresh chicken with expired produce. Last year, its Japan operation was hit by reports of foreign objects \u2013a piece of plastic and what appeared to be a human tooth \u2013 in McDonald\u2019s chicken nuggets and french fries. McDonald\u2019s Japan, which operates almost 3,000 stores, reported a group net loss of \u00a529 billion for the first nine months of 2015. It was expected to suffer a \u00a538 billion ($318 million) net loss for the full year, with sales forecast to drop 10%. Last year, the firm said it would close about 130 stores in Japan and refurbish 2,000 others in the next four years. The Nikkei business newspaper recently reported that the burger chain had reached out to investors about selling a part of its stake in its Japan business for 100 billion yen. The sweet-and-salty fries, which come with two types of chocolate sauce \u2013 milk and white \u2013 cost 330 yen (2.77 US dollars), compared with 270 yen for a medium-sized portion of the regular version. \u201cCustomers will find McChoco Potatoes enjoyable for different occasions, as it also makes for a great dessert. The combination creates a wonderful salty and sweet harmonious taste,\u201d the company said in a press release. Early reviews suggest the combination, while perhaps not to everyone\u2019s taste, works surprisingly well. \u201cSalt and chocolate complement each other quite well,\u201d Brian Ashcraft wrote on the Kotaku website. \u201cSince the fries are served hot, when you squirt on the sauce, the warm fries heat up the sauce. This causes the chocolate smell to become even stronger and more noticeable.\u201d Japanese consumers won\u2019t be able to indulge their sweet tooth for long, however: the chocolate fries will only be available until around mid-February, according to Rocket News.",

      "bodyText": "If there is any sign that the Australia economy is in a weird place, it is the reaction to Wednesday\u2019s inflation numbers. The annual inflation rate of 1.7% is well below the Reserve Bank\u2019s target rate of 2% to 3%. Yet the market\u2019s response was based on the assumption that inflation was too high to allow the Reserve Bank to cut rates next week. There really is no getting past the fact that inflation at the moment is historically low. While as a general rule, the Reserve Bank doesn\u2019t focus too greatly on the official \u201cconsumer price index\u201d, even if you use the RBA\u2019s underlying inflation measures of the trimmed mean and the weighted median, inflation is only running at 2.1% and 1.9% respectively: This isn\u2019t just a bit cool, it\u2019s practically frozen. Inflation is pretty much dead right now. And, yes, it is never so gone that it can\u2019t make a zombie-like return, but it has been nearly six years since underlying inflation has been over 3% (in March 2010). That is the longest sub-3% run that the RBA has charted for underlying inflation going all the way back to 1983. So we have a low inflation result, and what happens? Well, unexpectedly, the market reacts in a way that causes the value of the Australian dollar to rise as traders predict the figures mean the RBA won\u2019t cut rates next week. When inflation is higher than expected, the market assumes the RBA won\u2019t risk cutting rates; when inflation is lower than expected, the market assumes this gives the RBA room to cut rates. In reality, the RBA is now no more or less likely to cut rates next week than it was prior to the inflation figures coming out \u2013 and given the market was pricing in only a 19% chance, that chance was always pretty slim. So what happened? The market expected underlying inflation growth in the December quarter to be a bit lower than its 0.6%, and thus the algorithms in place no doubt caused a few trades to occur, pushing the dollar higher. But throughout the day, the consistent view was that the figures showed inflation was such that the RBA might be worried about cutting rates: The issue is that for some reason people like to annualise the most recent quarter (ie assume the next three quarters will be the same) to somehow predict where inflation is headed. Doing this is a mug\u2019s game \u2013 but it\u2019s great if you like overreacting, because annualised rates tend to bounce around pretty erratically: And it\u2019s worth noting that annualising the trimmed mean over the past six months \u2013 to try to get a little less excitable prediction \u2013 comes in at just 1.7%. If this is a level of inflation growth that would have the RBA worried, then we clearly have ditched the 2%-3% range. But the RBA hasn\u2019t, and we shouldn\u2019t either, when pondering what it might do. This is the case even more so when we look at what drove the (very low) inflation. The biggest contributor came via tradeables \u2013 those products whose price is determined on the world market. Somewhat ironically, this includes tobacco, which saw a 7.4% increase in the December quarter owing to the tobacco excise increase on 1 September last year. Overall the price rises of items that are \u201cnon-tradeable\u201d, ie that are mostly determined in Australia \u2013 such as rents, electricity, childcare and health costs \u2013 rose by just 0.4% in the December quarter and 2.3% in the past year \u2013 the lowest rate this century: Nothing in these figures would scare the RBA into thinking it needs to hold off on cutting rates for fear that inflation is about to let rip. Indeed, the drop in automotive fuel prices recorded in the inflation figures includes petrol prices from October which are more than 10 cents a litre higher than current prices, it is likely the March quarter inflation figures will again be low off the back of low petrol prices. Since 2010 the world price of oil in Australian dollars has coincidentally been in step with the ABS\u2019s index of automotive fuel. But in the past six months the price of oil has dropped much faster than petrol prices. Given the prediction for oil prices to keep falling, motorists around Australia should expect petrol prices to fall further: The main remit of the Reserve Bank is to keep inflation between 2% to3%, but it does this only in order to achieve \u201cthe maintenance of full employment in Australia\u201d and \u201cthe economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia\u201d. I often think the market focuses too greatly on the difference between its expectations of inflation than on the actual inflation level and also the state of the broader economy. Given the recent good employment figures, decent building activity and continuing solid house price rises nationally, the Reserve Bank was always unlikely to cut rates next week. The latest inflation figures only serve to underscore how little heat is in the overall economy, and if anything, show that should the RBA wish to cut rates, fears of inflation are no reason to stop them.",
