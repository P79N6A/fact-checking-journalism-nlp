    "webTitle": "Co-operative Group board member defends 'robust' business model", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Co-operative Group should not stray from the mutual model or add layers of authority that distance the group from its members, according to an independent member of its governing board. Ben Reid, chief executive of the Midcounties Co-operative, Britain's biggest independent customer-owned retailer, said the model had been proven to work and the Co-operative Group needed to respond to its troubles by getting back in touch with its customer owners. The co-operative model of member ownership has faced severe criticism after the Co-op Group, the movement's biggest business, was plunged into financial crisis last year when a \u00a31.5bn black hole was found in its banking arm. The group is expected to report a loss of at least \u00a32bn next month. Reid said: \"Independent cooperatives have weathered the recession well and have shown how robust the co-operative model is.\" Reid, who is one of the five representatives of independent co-operatives who sit on the Co-op Group's 21-strong board, declined to comment specifically on proposals from Lord Myners, its independent director, for overhauling its governance. Myners, called in to review how the group is run, has proposed an overhaul of the board of directors, which includes a nurse, a farmer and a tax official. He said governance at the group was worse than at the bailed-out banks in the run-up to the financial crisis. But Reid said: \"The co-operative model is alive and well. It might have taken a few knocks over the last few weeks but we have shown there is a way of doing this. I want to project it out there. Our movement is bigger than the problems we face. \"What we don't need is a multiplicity of layers in the structure that make it difficult for co-operative enthusiasts to have their voice heard.\" He also called for caution following Myners' initial report. \"I think there is still a lot of debate to be had. There has been an initial outline produced and we shouldn't get too excited until the full report comes out. It could be easy to misinterpret what he [Myners] means.\" In an interim report rushed out two weeks ago after the shock departure of former group chief executive Euan Sutherland, Myners proposed a smaller board made up mainly of outsiders with business experience. Members would elect representatives to a new membership council to oversee the board and spread power from about 100 activists who guide the group. Reid spoke as Midcounties announced operating profit up 21% to \u00a322m on revenues up 24% to \u00a31.2bn \u2013 the first independent co-operative to pass the billion-pound mark for sales. Midcounties, based in Warwickshire, will pay more than \u00a36m of dividends to its 439,000 members and staff. \"We are an independent society with direct connectivity to our membership. Maybe that is one of the things Lord Myners will look at in his report.\" Myners has claimed that one member of the group's board had threatened to block his proposals by using their influence over 28% of the votes that will determine whether they take effect. Reid said he was not the person Myners was talking about and that no one could wield that kind of power at the group. \"I just don't recognise the description. That isn't the way a co-op works. This isn't a plc where you log votes.\" He said Midcounties had \"taken a step back\" a few years ago to draw customers and employees, who volunteered more than 44,000 hours for local causes last year, into the business. That is what the group needs to do now, he added. \"I'm a believer so I believe it is possible. The trick we have to pull off with the group is to reconnect it to its membership. \"Whatever the structure is, and there will be all sorts of suggestions, we have to find a way for the voice of the ordinary members to influence the group and its strategy. That is what is more difficult as you get bigger.\" Reid said he supported the idea of bringing in independent non-executives and that he was very disappointed when Sutherland quit amid a furore over the \u00a33.6m pay deal he negotiated last year.",

The group is expected to report a loss of at least \u00a32bn next month.</p> <p>Reid said: \"Independent cooperatives have weathered the recession well and have shown how robust the co-operative model is.\" Reid, who is one of the five representatives of independent co-operatives who sit on the Co-op Group's 21-strong board, declined to comment specifically on proposals from Lord Myners, its independent director, for overhauling its governance.</p> <p>Myners, called in to review how the group is run, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/14/extent-co-op-shambles-laid-bare-by-lord-myners\" title=\"\">has proposed an overhaul of the board of directors</a>, which includes a nurse, a farmer and a tax official. He said governance at the group was worse than at the bailed-out banks in the run-up to the financial crisis.</p> <p>But Reid said: \"The co-operative model is alive and well. It might have taken a few knocks over the last few weeks but we have shown there is a way of doing this. I want to project it out there. Our movement is bigger than the problems we face.</p> <p>\"What we don't need is a multiplicity of layers in the structure that make it difficult for co-operative enthusiasts to have their voice heard.\"</p> <p>He also called for caution following Myners' initial report. \"I think there is still a lot of debate to be had. There has been an initial outline produced and we shouldn't get too excited until the full report comes out. It could be easy to misinterpret what he [Myners] means.\"</p> <p>In an interim report rushed out two weeks ago after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/11/co-operative-group-chief-executive-euan-sutherland-resign\" title=\"\">shock departure of former group chief executive Euan Sutherland</a>, Myners proposed a smaller board made up mainly of outsiders with business experience.</p> <p>Members would elect representatives to a new membership council to oversee the board and spread power from about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/23/co-op-myners-reforms-regional-members-power\" title=\"\"> 100 activists who guide the group</a>.</p> <p>Reid spoke as Midcounties announced operating profit up 21% to \u00a322m on revenues up 24% to \u00a31.2bn \u2013 the first independent co-operative to pass the billion-pound mark for sales. Midcounties, based in Warwickshire, will pay more than \u00a36m of dividends to its 439,000 members and&#xa0;staff.</p> <p>\"We are an independent society with direct connectivity to our membership. Maybe that is one of the things Lord Myners will look at in his report.\"</p> <p>Myners has claimed that one member of the group's board had threatened to block his proposals by using their influence over 28% of the votes that will determine whether they take effect.</p> <p>Reid said he was not the person Myners was talking about and that no one could wield that kind of power at the group.</p> <p>\"I just don't recognise the description. That isn't the way a co-op works. This isn't a plc where you log votes.\"</p> <p>He said Midcounties had \"taken a step back\" a few years ago to draw customers and employees, who volunteered more than 44,000 hours for local causes last year, into the business. That is what the group needs to do now, he added.</p> <p>\"I'm a believer so I believe it is possible. The trick we have to pull off with the group is to reconnect it to its membership.</p> <p>\"Whatever the structure is, and there will be all sorts of suggestions, we have to find a way for the voice of the ordinary members to influence the group and its strategy. That is what is more difficult as you get bigger.\"</p> <p>Reid said he supported the idea of bringing in independent non-executives and that he was very disappointed when Sutherland quit amid a furore over the \u00a33.6m pay deal he negotiated last year.</p>",

But they are broadly consistent with the limited hard data that is already available. As a result, the risks to our forecast of 0.5% growth in 2014 now appear to lie to the upside.</p> <p>Nonetheless, even growth of 0.4% in the first quarter would still be a disappointingly small improvement on the 0.3% registered in Q4 and would indicate that the eurozone\u2019s recovery is still struggling to gather significant momentum.

But as the euro area continues to integrate, it is important that countries outside the euro area are not at a systematic disadvantage in the EU.

      "bodyText": "Over to Greece where the finance minister has just told us that he expects a crucial parliamentary vote on the latest package of measures - the price of further further financial assistance - to go smoothly on Sunday. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The reforms may be unpopular among MPs and industry groups but prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 fragile coalition is confident that the vote now needed to release more than \u20ac10bn in aid will ultimately pass on Sunday As many as eight ruling coalition lawmakers had emerged as potential rejectors of the bill \u2013 an omnibus piece of legislation encompassing a wide range of measures to boost the debt-stricken country\u2019s competitiveness. With a majority of just three any losses could have have spelt catastrophe for the government which faces a bond repayment of some \u20ac9. bn in May. But the finance minister Yannis Stournaras flatly ruled out such a scenario. \u201cI expect that it will go smoothly,\u201d the finance minister told me this afternoon. \u201cMPs feel the responsibility of the moment \u2026 they understand that Greece has emerged from the grave, that the worst is behind it,\u201d he said. Deputies in both the centre right New Democracy party and centre left Pasok had been especially incensed by a reform that will allow longer shelf-life for milk, arguing it would enable cheap, low quality milk from Bulgaria and Romania to flood the market. But even though industry figures joined others today in opposing the reform, Stournaras insisted that the issue had been resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s been settled, they now understand that the regulation is actually a good one.\" The macro-economics professor, the only technocrat in the two-party administration, said the once crisis-plagued Greek economy was now \u201cso benign\u201d he did not expect any political turmoil on the horizon. \u201cI am not afraid at all,\u201d he said speaking of upcoming euro elections in May. \u201cGreece\u2019s place in the eurozone is fully secured \u2026 the economy is so benign there won\u2019t be any problems,\u201d he added predicting that Athens\u2019 primary surplus, which is to be announced by Eurostat towards the end of April, would be at least \u20ac2bn or 1 percent of GDP. \u201cI can tell you with certainty that it will be around 1 percent of GDP.\u201d The government has originally forecast the surplus would be no more than half a percent of national output but the finance minister said Athens had outperformed all targets. \u201cTwo-thirds will come from reduction of expenditure and the rest from increased revenue from both tax and non-tax,\u201d he explained. The bumper aid package \u2013 which took seven months to negotiate with the country\u2019s triumvirate of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF \u2013 is expected to be rubberstamped by an Ecofin meeting of finance ministers in Athens on Tuesday. Stournaras repeated that the government\u2019s next aim would be to reach an agreement with lenders that would resolve the root of the country\u2019s financial woes: its monumental debt. \u201cWe have done more than what we promised,\u201d he said. \u201c\u201dNow it\u2019s time for our partners to realize the decision they made back in November 2012 to open talks to reduce [our] debt load further.\u201d And on that note it's time to close for the day and indeed the week. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back next week. Have a good weekend. Positive comments from the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, eased fears that the country's economy would continue to slow down, and helped markets to a positive end to the week. All week investors had been hoping for signs that China would make moves to stimulate its economy, and the premier's words reinforced that view. Mining companies in particular were in demand, China being a major consumer of commodities. Investors seemed able to shrug off the continuing tensions over Ukraine. So the final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 27.26 points or 0.41% higher at 6615.58 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 1.44% to 9587.19 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.74% better at 4411.26 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 1.53% higher at 21,498.24 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended up 1.27% at 10,328.9 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 78 points or 0.48% higher. The US Federal Reserve should keep interest rates low until early 2016 and only raise them gradually, according to one of the central bank's officials. Chicago Fed chairman Charles Evans, a noted dove but a non-voting member this year, said the Fed had to make sure it did not derail the economic recovery by acting too quickly. Evans said in Hong Kong: I personally doubt that the funds rate is going to start to increase before the middle of 2015. It's more likely to be late, after the middle of 2015. I'd actually hold off until early 2016 for the funds rate increase. (Quotes from Reuters and Market News International) Cyprus has abolished maximum daily cash withdrawal limits a year after it imposed capital controls. The country made the move to prevent a flight of cash out of the country during its painful bailout. It now says the banking system had now stabilised enough to allow the lifting of the \u20ac300 a day limit. Meanwhile: Back with the UK insurers, and Resolution has issued a statement after the news of the FCE probe into pensions and savings. Resolution said: Resolution notes the FCA's announcement regarding a review of the fair treatment of long standing customers in life insurance. We look forward to receiving further details from the FCA. We put all of our customers at the heart of our business and engage with them on a regular basis. In 2011, Resolution established Heritage, a standalone division with a dedicated management team specifically focused on meeting the ongoing needs of customers with legacy products. An example of the benefits from this specific focus is the recent investments in the Heritage division, including the migration of our customers from legacy systems to a modern IT platform that will deliver improved customer service. The costs of these investments are borne by Resolution and do not fall to customers. Life insurance has been and remains a highly regulated industry. It has undergone a series of independent reviews to ensure transparency and fair treatment of customers. We therefore look forward with confidence to working with the FCA once it issues official guidance. The company's shares are still down 8% however. Earlier, the latest US consumer confidence figures came in lower than expected. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index slipped to 80 in March, down from 81.6 the month before. It was higher than the preliminary March reading of 79.9 but below forecasts of 80.5. Survey director Richard Curtin said: Current conditions in the overall economy were reported by consumers to have recently weakened, and long term prospects for the economy softened. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: Opposing forces might have played an important role in driving sentiment in March. More seasonal weather conditions and the improvement in the labour market are likely to have been supportive but rising confidence has been somehow limited from the recent spike in fuel prices and energy bills in late March. Back in the corporate world and pharmaceuticals group Shire has slipped back after a US court setback. A Federal court of appeal has reversed an earlier ruling in favour of Shire in a patent case against Actavis. The earlier judgement said Activis' Watson unit had infringed Shire's patent over Lialda - a treatment for bowel disease - but the appeal court said the scope of the patent had been incorrectly analysed. Shire's shares are currently down nearly 2%. One final chart from the ONS: here is the UK's current account as a share of GDP. To recap we found out today the UK's current account - a deficit of \u00a322.8bn - is worth 5.4% of GDP. And that's all from me. Nick Fletcher will be taking over for the rest of the afternoon. Thank you for following so far and for all your comments. How much will global warming cost the economy? And can economists be trusted to work out the answer? A United Nations draft report has forecast that climate change would cut economic output by between 0.2 and 2.0 % a year by damaging human health, disrupting water supplies and raising sea levels. But according to Reuters, some think this doesn't go far enough. But many countries reckon that is an underestimate because it excludes risks of catastrophic changes, such as a runaway melt of Greenland's ice, collapse of coral reefs or a drying of the Amazon rainforest that could cause massive economic losses. Trying to address the objections, an updated draft text from the meeting on Friday, obtained by Reuters, adds that impact estimates \"do not yet account for catastrophic changes, tipping points, and many other details. The British government has described the 0.2-2% data as \"at best an under-estimate, and at worst completely meaningless\". Here is Bob Ward, communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. Economists argue that it's difficult to estimate risks of catastrophic events, so they leave them out. But that's like saying the risk is zero, which isn\u2019t true. Is the picture brightening in the eurozone? While today's consumer sentiment data suggests it is, Capital Economics sounds a cautionary note. A note from the famously bearish consultancy says that although the recovery \"probably gained a little momentum in the first quarter\", growth is likely to remain \"disappointingly sluggish\" while risks of deflation are growing. From Capital Economics' Jessica Hinds: Of course, the relationship of these [consumer sentiment] surveys with GDP growth is far from perfect. But they are broadly consistent with the limited hard data that is already available. As a result, the risks to our forecast of 0.5% growth in 2014 now appear to lie to the upside. Nonetheless, even growth of 0.4% in the first quarter would still be a disappointingly small improvement on the 0.3% registered in Q4 and would indicate that the eurozone\u2019s recovery is still struggling to gather significant momentum. Even in Germany, the survey data published last week suggest that growth is likely to remain solid rather than spectacular. Consequently, the pressure will build on the ECB to ease monetary policy further in the coming months to head off deflation and support the economic recovery. On that front, comments from ECB officials last week hinted that further action might be on the cards. Bank of Finland governor Erkki Liikanen stressed that a negative deposit rate was \u201cnot a controversial issue\u201d while the Bundesbank\u2019s Jens Weidmann unexpectedly appeared to soften his anti-QE stance. Weidmann said QE was no longer \"out of the question\", while Liikanen also suggested the door wasn't closed to an expansive monetary policy.\ufeff Capital Economics is not expecting any action at the ECB's meeting next Thursday, but thinks monetary-stimulus (in the form of quantitative easing) is possible. To underline the point, the euro has fallen to a three-week low against the dollar today as investors take the hint of further ECB action. In Berlin the red carpet has been rolled out for China's president Xi Jinping, the first state visit to Germany by a Chinese president in 8 years. He is meeting German chancellor Angela Merkel, and is expected to give a speech later today about China's role in the world. Ahead of his arrival in Berlin on Friday, Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed his optimism for closer economic ties with Germany, which is already its most important trade partner in Europe. Here are some more details on the trip from Deutsche Welle. The Chinese president described relations between the two economic powerhouses as \"close,\" in a commentary published on Friday in the German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Cooperation between China and Germany - the leading economies in Asia and the EU - could open the world to enormous possibilities of economic growth, he added. China is Germany's most important trade partner in Asia and second most important globally after the US. According to provisional figures the government statistics agency Destatis, the value of exports to China - mainly vehicles, machines, electrical and chemical products - reached 67 billion euros ($92.1 billion) in 2013. Meanwhile, imports from the Asian country cost 73.4 billion euros in total. For its part, Germany ranks as China's sixth most important trade partner in the world, and its most important in the EU. The visit has also drawn protesters demonstrating for a free Tibet and protection of the Uigurs in north western China. I promised German inflation data, and finally, here it is. Germany's statistics agency has reported that prices are expected to have risen by 1.0% in March 2014 on the previous year. This relatively low rate of inflation reflects falling energy prices, which have offset an rise in food prices. The March figure is 0.9% when calculated using a more widely-used European methodology. In the latest update on US consumption, we learn that consumer spending grew by 0.3% in February, a fraction higher than the 0.2% recorded in January. Here is an extract from the Reuters' report: The Commerce Department said on Friday that consumer spending increased 0.3% last month after rising by a revised 0.2% in January. Spending was previously reported to have increased 0.4 percent in January.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rising 0.3% in February.The dollar rose to a session high against the yen after the data. U.S. stock index futures were little changed. Spending in February was lifted by an increase in services consumption, likely because of increased demand for health care and utilities. And from AP on the bigger picture Many analysts foresee the economy growing 3% for the year, after a weak first quarter. It would be the most robust annual expansion since 2005, two years before the Great Recession began. The National Association for Business Economics is predicting that the economy will grow 3.1% this year, far higher than the lacklustre 1.9% gain in 2013. If that forecast proves accurate, it would make 2014 the strongest year since the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, expanded 3.4% in 2005. Since the Great Recession ended in June 2009, annual growth over the past four years has averaged a weak 2.2%. George Osborne and Ed Miliband are attempting to woo small business at the Federation of Small Business conference in Manchester. In his speech, the Labour leader concentrated his fire on the 'big six' energy companies. He said that the energy market competition inquiry announced on Thursday showed he was right to argue the market was rigged. And he said gas and electricity price rises cannot be justified until the market has been reformed. The big six energy companies have made huge profits at the expense not just of hard-working families but hard-working business people too. They have done it because the market just isn't working. And while we reform that broken market, there can be no justification for further price rises. Because we now have official confirmation that these will be price rises taking advantage of a market that is rigged. Meanwhile, the chancellor set out plans to make it easier for small businesses to get credit, if they have been turned down by a bank. More details here. A big bank saying 'no' should not be the end of the line for a small business. Now, with our plan, it won't be. But the big revelation of the day... More Blackberry crumble. The Canadian smartphone maker has reported a loss of $423 million (\u00a3254m) for the final quarter of 2014. A painful result for shareholders, but not as bad as the \u00a32.7bn loss it reported a year earlier. Read more on Canada's CBC Business news. And now it's all gone. The tumble in insurance stocks has helped wipe out the gains the FTSE100 made earlier today. The UK's bluechip index is now largely flat on its opening value at around 6590 points. Shares in Aviva are down 7.9%; Legal &amp; General has fallen 7.5%. This means the UK has been outperformed by all the major continental markets, as mining stocks rise on a construction boom in China. Correction: I typed the wrong numbers for the insurance shares in my 9.29 post. These have been deleted with the latest, correct, numbers are here. Is it springtime in the eurozone? Consumer and business confidence hit its highest level for five years in March, with morale improving in Spain and Italy. The European Commission's economic sentiment indicator was 102.4, up 1.3 points, comfortably higher than economists forecast of 101.4. The five largest eurozone economies all saw an increase in economic sentiment, mostly fuelled by buoyant consumer confidence. The Netherlands+2.3 Spain +2.2 Italy +1.3 France +0.7 Germany +0.4 This is what the Commission said Consumer confidence was particularly buoyant, registering the sharpest monthly increase since April 2009 (+3.4). Consumers' views on the future general economic situation and the level of future unemployment, as well as their savings expectations improved sharply. The improvement in households' expected financial situation was comparatively moderate. The slight improvement in retail trade confidence (+0.4) was the result of managers' more positive evaluation of the volume of stocks in combination with broadly unchanged assessments of the present and expected business situation. The flat development in construction confidence (-0.3) reflects opposing tendencies in its two components: while employment expectations were revised upwards, managers showed increased concern about the level of order books. One interesting footnote: the Commission data shows that sentiment in the UK fell by 4.1%\ufeff, a finding at odds with the upbeat survey from domestic organisations - see 8.16 You can read the full release - and see all the charts - here. Labour has issued its reaction to news that Germany wants to protect the interests of non-eurozone countries in the event of treaty change. Read in at 8.41. The party's Europe spokesman Gareth Thomas said: Labour wants to see Europe work better for Britain, and that includes reforms to ensure Europe does more to boost growth and jobs here in the UK. Of course, as the eurozone consolidates, there need to be proper safeguards to protect the single market. But what David Cameron won't admit is that, because of his arbitrary timescale of 2017, he now only has 24 months to convince all 27 member states to agree to major treaty change on the terms set by Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers. EU reform is possible, and necessary, but David Cameron is unable to approach it in a sensible way. The gap between what his party will accept and what our European allies can agree to remains unbridgeable. Via PA A sharp-eyed reader points out that the savings rate is falling. The relevant link is here Turning to the Ukraine crisis, Germany's energy and economy minister Sigmar Gabriel has said there is \"no sensible alternative\" to Russian natural gas imports. According to the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitungand he said it was unlikely Russia would stop deliveries because of the crisis over Ukraine. \"Even in the darkest hours of the Cold War Russia respected its contracts. Germany imports one third of its gas from Russia, while energy utilities E.ON and RWE get most of their supply from Russia's state-controlled gas producer Gazprom. This reads like a rebuff to Barack Obama who this week urged Europe to do more to reduce its dependence on Russian gas. Economists have also been giving their reaction to the latest GDP data. Howard Archer of IHS, who is forecasting GDP growth of 2.7% for 2014, is encouraged by today's numbers. Encouragingly, growth in the fourth quarter was much less dependent on consumer spending, with business investment and exports seeing marked improvement. Indeed, business investment rose 2.4% quarter-on-quarter and 8.7% year-on-year. In addition, net trade was markedly positive, with export growth revised up appreciably to 2.8% quarter-on-quarter. Consumer spending growth actually slowed appreciably compared to the third quarter but was respectable. But the current account shortfall - \u00a371.1bn for 2013 - still looks \"horrible\" with few signs it may improve dramatically. Exports should benefit from improving global growth in 2014 although net trade\u2019s contribution will still be limited by solid domestic demand sucking in imports. The strong pound could also have some limiting impact on exports. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, warns that consumer spending looks unsustainable. While growth has remained strong through the past 12 months or so, today\u2019s numbers confirm that it has come at a cost. Disposable real income fell by 0.1% and the amount of money saved by UK households fell to 5% from 5.6% - a clear sign that the reserves that the UK consumer is relying on to fund services spending is being depleted. We saw yesterday that retail sales had flown higher in the UK in February \u2013 at a stronger annualised rate than China \u2013 but we all know that this is coming from unsustainable spending practices via an expansion of consumer credit and a reduction in savings patterns. Here is a round-up of the best analysis and reaction on Twitter to the latest batch of UK economic data. As expected the UK economy grew by 0.7% in October- December, in line with earlier estimates. But GDP for the full year was revised down to 1.8%, compared to the earlier estimate of a 1.9% increase. GDP for the five quarters - Q4 12 - Q13 - was left unchanged at 2.7% The full data set published by the Office for National Statistics is available here. Here is what else we have learned. The current account deficit was \u00a322.4 billion in Q4 2013, only a smidgeon below the \u00a322.8 bn in the previous quarter, and still far bigger than the \u00a314bn economists had expected. This makes the Q4 deficit 5.4% of GDP, down from 5.6% in the previous quarter. In 2013, the UK was a net borrower of \u00a365.7 billion, up from \u00a355.4 billion in 2012. The ONS says this was mainly a result of increased deficits in income and current transfers, partially offset by a decreased deficit in trade. UK service industries grew by 0.4% in January. Breaking news: GDP stands unchanged at 0.7% for Oct-Dec 2013, but the current account deficit is worse than expected. But for UK insurance companies it is another story. Their stocks are tanking after it emerged that regulators are planning an investigation looking into 30m policies sold between 1970 and 2000. Clive Adamson, the director of supervision at the FCA, told the Daily Telegraph We want to find out how closed-book products are being serviced by insurance companies, as we are concerned insurers are allocating an unfair amount of overheads to historic funds. As firms cut prices and create new products there is a danger that customers with older contracts are forgotten. We want to ensure they get a fair deal. As part of the review we will collect information to establish whether we need to intervene on exit charges. European stocks are up this morning, as optimism about the global economy lifts mining shares. FTSE 100 +0.55% to 6623 points Germany's Dax +0.77% at 9523 points France's CAC 40 +0.38% at 4395 points Italy's FTSE MIB +0.8% at 21, 345 points Investors are feeling optimistic after China's premier Li Keqiang indicated he was ready to support further stimulus, a boon for natural resource companies. Here are some extracts from his speech, courtesy of Reuters. We have gathered experience from successfully battling the economic downturn last year and we have policies in store to counter economic volatility for this year. We will launch relevant and forceful measures according to what we have planned in our government work report. The overall performance in the economy so far this year is relatively stable and we saw some positive changes, but we cannot neglect the increasing downward pressure and difficulties. A few more details on those French consumer spending figures: household spending on goods increased by 0.1% in February, Insee reported this morning. This was a big improvement on the 2.1% decrease in January, although far from where economists expected spending to go. Consumption of most goods, including food and clothing was down, although spending on cars was up. See the full data here. In a potentially significant result for David Cameron, Germany has said the interests of non-eurozone countries must be protected in the event of further EU integration. In a joint letter in the Financial Times chancellor George Osborne and his German counterpart Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble say that treaty change must guarantee \"fairness\" for those outside the eurozone. Here is the key extract: A stable euro is good for the global economy, and especially for Europe. The crisis has shown that the eurozone needs a common fiscal and economic policy with corresponding improved governance. The UK fully recognises the progress made so far in responding to the crisis, and it supports the case for further steps forward. But as the euro area continues to integrate, it is important that countries outside the euro area are not at a systematic disadvantage in the EU. So future EU reform and treaty change must include reform of the governance framework to put euro area integration on a sound legal basis, and guarantee fairness for those EU countries inside the single market but outside the single currency. Some suggest that reforming the EU is impossible. We have already proved them wrong. Last year saw the first ever real-terms cut to the EU budget. Together, we are proposing a programme for cutting red tape in Europe that already has the support of 12 other member states and the European parliament. The FT describes this as a boost for David Cameron, whose relationship with chancellor Angela Merkel seems to have improved after a rocky start. But the paper points out that treaty change remains a contentious issue. Germany\u2019s desire for treaty change is not shared elsewhere in the EU, especially in France, which does not endorse Berlin\u2019s enthusiasm for more centralised budgetary control in the eurozone. There would also be widespread opposition to any treaty change that triggered referendums in any member state because the rise of populist and anti-European parties would make such polls a perilous exercise. Mats Persson, director of the Open Europe think-tank, described Germany\u2019s commitment as \u201ca substantial win for Osborne and Cameron\u201d. He added: \u201cThis is the first time treaty changes for further eurozone integration and safeguarding the rights of non-euro countries have been linked by senior German and UK figures.\" Also worth reading: an FT editorial is full of praise for Nick Clegg after the Liberal Democrat leader took on Nigel Farage of UKIP in a TV debate on Wednesday. Mr Clegg \"has valiantly led the way\" in exposing the darker edges of Farage's euroscepticism, it writes. \"Others must follow.\" But will they? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. So far, the UK\u2019s economic recovery has been a story of shopping and house prices. Today we will learn more about the fine detail of the economic picture, with official data out later expected to confirm that the UK economy grew by 0.7% in the last quarter of 2013. While the Bank of England is worried the housing market is overheating, consumer confidence is picking up. People were feeling more optimistic about their personal finances and the bigger economic picture in March than at any point over the last six years, according to market researchers GfK. The upcoming batch of data from the ONS is also expected to show good news for the UK\u2019s trade balance, according to Reuters Insider. Market watchers expect nothing less. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets writes The growth rate is encouraging and retail sales and confidence are high in the UK, markets will be looking for the needed uptick in investment spending to give the economic recovery more balance. It is a different story in France, where consumers remain reluctant to spend: household spending grew by just 0.1% in February, way below expectations of a 0.8% rise. We are also expecting a slight slowdown in German inflation. I\u2019ll have more on those stories and all the latest...",

Perhaps the acquisition is a signal that Bacbock's core defence markets are mature. But no one can doubt Babcock's track record. And as ever, there is some clever financial engineering. Vague talk of a possible merger between Mitchells &amp; Butlers, down 6.3p at 448.7p, and Greene King, 2p lower at 891.5p, did the rounds. Meanwhile Jefferies issued a positive note on M&amp;B, saying: M&amp;B's chief executive and finance director presented to the Jefferies sales desk [on Thursday] afternoon. We reiterate our buy recommendation and remain confident that the re-rating opportunity is realistic. No information on current trading was forthcoming. M&amp;B expressed the view that the economy outside London and the south east remains fragile although expects conditions to improve as wage inflation starts to outstrip inflation. Lower down the market Kromek crashed 29p to 39p after the radiation detection specialist warned full year revenues would be significantly below expectations due to a delays with a number of large contracts, and it would not now break even. Analysts at the company's broker Panmure Gordon said: [The] profit warning from Kromek is clearly a disappointing turn of events. The business, while on the cusp of accelerating its commercial strategy, has found itself on the wrong side of delays to the commencement of UK and US government contracts, weakness in the Japanese market for nuclear detection products, delays in setting up its distribution channels in nuclear radiation and delays in other commercial contracts. Our downgrades will now see the business loss-making in 2014, reaching EBITDA breakeven in 2015. We downgrade to hold with a target price of 50p (previously 92p).",

      "bodyText": "Britain was warned over the sustainability of the recoveryafter official figures showed the country's trading position was much worse than expected and separate data suggested consumers were running down their savings as real incomes fell. The current account deficit \u2013 made up of the trade deficit, plus losses on overseas ventures \u2013 came in at \u00a322.4bn in the fourth quarter last year, far above forecasts from City economists and down only slightly from a record \u00a322.8bn deficit in the third quarter. It was well above a consensus forecast of a \u00a314bn deficit in a Reuters poll of economists. As a percentage of GDP, the deficit was 5.4%, down from 5.6% in the third quarter. Separate data confirmed GDP rose 0.7% in the fourth quarter, as expected, but detail showed the percentage of household savings fell to a five-year low in 2013 while real disposable income slipped 0.1% in the last three months of the year. The current account gap underlined fears about imbalances in the UK economy, said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec. Describing the currrent account figures as \"very poor\" he said: \"As a proportion of GDP, the current account positions in Q3 and Q4 last year represent the largest two quarterly deficits in the history of the UK (5.6% and 5.4% respectively) and sit uncomfortably with hopes of an external rebalancing in the economy.\" For 2013 as a whole, the ONS said the UK was a net borrower of \u00a365.7bn, up from \u00a355.4bn in 2012. \"This was mainly a result of increased deficits in income and current transfers, partially offset by a decreased deficit in trade,\" it said, which will be of some comfort to George Osborne as he vows to raise net exports and boost Britain's trade performance. ONS chief economist Joe Grice underlined the net trade situation in a statement alongside Friday's figures. \"As a percentage of GDP, the current account deficits over recent quarters represent some of the largest on record. However, relatively little of this is due to deteriorating net trade. Most of the decline stems from falling income from UK assets overseas, compared with income from foreign-owned assets in the UK,\" he said. But Rob Wood, chief UK economist at German bank Berenberg, said: \"This looks like a domestic recovery and it is quacking like one. Hence the UK's colossal balance of payments deficit is showing no signs of closing \u2026 The UK is storing up big problems for the future.\" Separate data confirmed economic growth of 0.7% in the fourth quarter. While unchanged from the previous two Office for National Statistics estimates, this release provided more detail on the nature of that growth. Samuel Tombs, UK economist at the thinktank Capital Economics, said the details painted a mixed picture on rebalancing. \"On a positive note, a bigger proportion of the 0.7% rise in GDP in the fourth quarter is now thought to have come from net exports. Business investment is also still thought to have grown by 2.4% quarter-on-quarter. But as we feared, the 0.4% quarterly rise in real household spending was funded by households saving less.\" Providing more evidence people were having to dip into their savings after years of falling real wages, the ONS said there was a drop in households' saving ratio, which estimates the amount of money households have available to save as a percentage of their total disposable income. Suggesting that Osborne's bid to turn things around with his \"budget for savers\" this month will face big challenges, the savings ratio slumped to 5.1% in 2013 from 7.3% in 2012. For the fourth quarter alone, the savings ratio dropped to 5% from 5.6% in the third quarter.The ONS also revised down its estimate for growth over the whole of 2013 to 1.7% from a previous estimate of 1.8%. While recent growth and the outlook from many forecasters puts the UK ahead of many other advanced economies in terms of the pace of GDP expansion, comparisons with how it has regained ground since the global financial crisis are less favourable. Britain's GDP remains 1.4% below the pre-downturn peak. While the government has pushed for a rebalancing towards more manufacturing and exports and less reliance on consumer spending, the shape of the recovery so far suggests little progress. The ONS said on Friday that the dominant service sector had surpassed its pre-crisis peak in the autumn of last year. However, the production industries remain 12.1% below their pre-downturn peak, with manufacturing 8.9% lower. Similarly, construction remains 12.5% below the peak.",
