      "bodyText": "Free housing, food, transport and access to the internet should be given to British citizens in a massive expansion of the welfare state, according to a report warning the rapid advance of technology will lead to job losses. Former senior government official Jonathan Portes and Professor Henrietta Moore, director of University College London\u2019s Institute for Global Prosperity make the call for a raft of new \u201cuniversal basic services\u201d using the same principles as the NHS. They estimate it would cost about \u00a342bn, which could be funded by changes to the tax system. The recommendations include doubling Britain\u2019s existing social housing stock with funding to build 1.5m new homes, which would be offered for free to those in most need. A food service would provide one third of meals for 2.2m households deemed to experience food insecurity each year, while free bus passes would be made available to everyone, rather than just the over-60s. The proposals also include access to basic phone services, the internet, and the cost of the BBC licence fee being paid for by the state. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the recommendations would \u201chelp inform Labour\u2019s thinking\u201d. \u201cThis report offers bold new thinking on how we can overcome those challenges and create an economy that is radically fairer and offers opportunities for all,\u201d he added. Although British workers are expected to be put increasingly at risk from technological automation in the coming years, leading to job losses and a potential requirement for more state support, such wide-ranging reforms are likely to face tough opposition. Voters may balk at the higher taxes required, with the report earmarking a massive reduction in the personal tax allowance from the current rate of \u00a311,500 to as little as \u00a34,300 to pay for the changes. Steady increases to the threshold at which people start paying income tax have proven popular in polling, while the Conservatives claim about 4 million people have been lifted out of income tax altogether since 2010. Lowering the rate by \u00a37,200 would also set the personal allowance at a level unseen since the turn of the millennium. However, the recommendations come amid growing calls for greater levels of state intervention, including nationalisation of utilities. A major study of public opinion following the general election by the rightwing Legatum Institute and pollsters Populus found as many as 83% would support public ownership of the UK\u2019s water, while 77% back nationalisation of the railways. The findings could increase pressure on Philip Hammond ahead of his budget next month, even as fresh figures show the amount of money available to the exchequer at risk from weaker levels of productivity in the UK since the financial crisis. The Conservatives have however pledged to increase government spending on housing and university tuition fees, as they attempt to counter growing support for Jeremy Corybn\u2019s Labour party. The universal basic services report suggests the private sector, charities or the state could operate the new raft of benefits. The value for an individual using all services would represent \u00a3126 of net weekly earnings, which would also stand to benefit the poorest in society most. The authors of the report also argue their recommendations would be more affordable response to potential disruption to the labour market from technological automation than a universal basic income, which would see cash payments given to all UK citizens. They said focusing on more comprehensive service provision rather than handouts would also mean there remains a strong incentive on citizens to find work. Portes, of King\u2019s College, London, said: \u201cThe role of the state is to ensure an equitable distribution of not just money, but opportunity to participate and contribute to society. For that to be meaningful, there are likely to be certain services everyone should be able to access.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned the world\u2019s richest nations to have a greater sense of urgency about climate change, a day after the former Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, delivered a bizarre speech to a London-based thinktank claiming climate change was \u201cprobably doing good\u201d. The IMF\u2019s latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), released overnight, has dedicated an entire chapter to the impact of weather shocks and climate change on global economic activity. It warns coping with climate change will be one of the \u201cfundamental challenges\u201d of the 21st century and it calls on the global community to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions before they create \u201cmore irreversible damage\u201d, saying richer countries must help low-income economies adapt to rapidly increasing temperatures. Directly contradicting one of Abbott\u2019s arguments that Australia\u2019s contribution to global emissions has been so small it is not worth restructuring its economy to change its energy use significantly, the IMF says nations with developed economies such as Australia \u2013 one of the highest per capita emitters in the world \u2013 have a responsibility to act. \u201cAdvanced and emerging market economies have contributed the lion\u2019s share to actual and projected climate change,\u201d the report says. \u201cHelping low-income developing countries cope with the consequences of climate change is both a humanitarian imperative and sound global economic policy that helps offset countries\u2019 failure to fully internalise the costs of greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cSince the turn of the 20th century, the Earth\u2019s average surface temperature has increased significantly. Sizeable swings in global temperatures used to happen over long periods, such as fluctuations in and out of the Ice Ages. However, the speed at which the climate has changed over the past 30-40 years appears to be unprecedented in the past 20,000 years. \u201cClimate change is a negative global externality of potentially catastrophic proportions and only collective action and multilateral cooperation can effectively address its causes and consequences.\u201d Overall, the IMF is estimating global output growth will increase from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.6% in 2017 and 3.7% in 2018, after upgrading its growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points for 2017 and 2018. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, says the global cyclical upswing that began midway through 2016 is continuing to gather strength and is reaching more broadly than any upswing in a decade \u2013 roughly 75% of the world economy, measured by GDP at purchasing power parity, is sharing in the acceleration. But he has cautioned the recovery may not be sustainable because growth in nominal and real wages remains weak compared with past recoveries, including in Australia. \u201cIn particular, most advanced economies face medium-term growth rates significantly lower than in the decade before the global financial crisis of 2007\u201309,\u201d he said. Abbott warned this week, in a speech that was being politely ignored by some of his colleagues on Tuesday, that climate change itself was \u201cprobably doing good; or at least, more good than harm,\u201d and measures to deal with climate change would damage Australia\u2019s economy. \u201cIn most countries, far more people die in cold snaps than in heatwaves, so a gradual lift in global temperatures, especially if it\u2019s accompanied by more prosperity and more capacity to adapt to change, might even be beneficial,\u201d he said. The IMF warns specifically in its report that rising global temperatures could wreak havoc in parts of the world, particularly in hotter climates where people were too poor to migrate. Obstfeld has called on the global community to exploit the current cyclical global upswing to pursue domestic and international reforms. \u201cPriorities for mutually beneficial cooperation include strengthening the global trading system, further improving financial regulation, enhancing the global financial safety net, reducing international tax avoidance, fighting famine and infectious diseases, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions before they create more irreversible damage, and helping poorer countries, which are not themselves substantial emitters, adapt to climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the strength of the current upswing makes the moment ideal for domestic reforms, its breadth makes multilateral cooperation opportune. Policymakers should act while the window of opportunity is open.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "E.ON chief: Theresa May's energy price cap will hurt competition", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Theresa May\u2019s price cap on energy bills would be a backward step that hits competition, deters new companies and hurts consumers, the head of one of the country\u2019s biggest energy firms has warned. Michael Lewis, UK chief executive of big six supplier E.ON, rejected the prime minister\u2019s claim the energy market is broken and said plans for a cap on 12m households would backfire. The government is due to publish draft legislation on Thursday to enable a ceiling on \u201crip-off\u201d standard variable tariffs, arguing consumers are collectively paying \u00a31.4bn too much for energy. The government\u2019s hand was strengthened after a round of price hikes on those tariffs this year. But Lewis said a cap was the wrong idea at the wrong time. \u201cWe are actually in a situation where the market is working quite well. We have 60 competitors. We have high levels of switching ... A cap will actually dampen competition, reduce engagement and take us backwards,\u201d he said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cThere will be less incentive [for new challenger firms] to come into the market, and customers will have less incentive to engage with the market,\u201d he added. The result would be households are disadvantaged rather than helped, he said. Instead of capping bills, ministers should embark on a nationwide insulation programme and help energy suppliers install smart meters, which Lewis said would drive up consumer engagement in the market. \u201cOur view has always been that the problem here is not a price problem, the problem is an engagement problem. Not enough customers engage with their supplier,\u201d he said. He said the company\u2019s investment in smart meters and renewables \u2013 the firm recently finished a windfarm off the Sussex coast \u2013 were at risk from a cap. \u201cAll that investment is predicated on us being successful in the market,\u201d he added. Lewis would not be drawn on whether the German-headquartered company would cut costs to adapt to a cap. On Tuesday, a credit ratings agency said the cap would exacerbate pressures on the big six energy suppliers\u2019 profit margins, which are at record high. S&amp;P Global said the impact would be greatest on UK-based Centrica and SSE, who are more exposed to Britain\u2019s domestic supply market. Centrica\u2019s chairman and chief executive have sought to reassure investors this week by buying more than \u00a3250,000 worth of shares in their company, which owns British Gas. There is an increasing industry consensus that there is no future for standard variable tariffs which May plans to cap. Scottish Power said this week that it would start rolling customers on to cheaper fixed deals instead, following a recent announcement by E.ON that its smart meter customers would no longer default on to standard variable tariffs. \u201cThe standard variable tariff is over,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cWe want to be on the front foot in defining what the new world looks like.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two points are clear from business secretary Greg Clark\u2019s statement to parliament about Bombardier. First, the government\u2019s lobbying is concentrated on persuading Boeing to withdraw its complaint that the Canadian plane maker, with 4,000 workers in Belfast, has been illegally dumping jets in the US. Ministers still think the 300% tariffs imposed by the US on imports of Bombardier\u2019s C-series plane would be overthrown in the next stage of the process, but the primary goal is to get Boeing to back down. The second conclusion is that the government has achieved nothing so far. Even after a face-to-face meeting with Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Clark had no progress to report. He could only offer his determination to keep pushing. For the time being, the tactics, coordinated with the Canadian government, make sense. If Boeing can be cajoled into dropping its complaint, the dispute would disappear overnight. By contrast, relying on the US International Trade Commission, which has the final say on tariffs, to reject the ruling of the US Department of Commerce is a lottery. Boeing doesn\u2019t make an aircraft that competes directly with Bombardier\u2019s, so it ought to be hard for it to prove material injury, but you wouldn\u2019t wish to bet 4,000 UK jobs on a US agency finding against a big American corporation in the current climate. So what if Boeing refuses to budge? What if these appeals to Boeing\u2019s better nature as a \u201cpartner\u201d to the UK continue to go nowhere? In that case, Clark will have to spell out what retaliation the UK is prepared to take and what \u201cjeopardising\u201d the relationship means in practice. A specific threat to reduce spending with the company would represent a high-risk escalation of the dispute since, as Boeing constantly points out, it spent \u00a32.1bn in its UK supply chain in 2016 and 18,700 UK jobs rely on its presence. But the UK government can\u2019t dither indefinitely. If polite lobbying doesn\u2019t work, the UK will have to decide whether it wants to play tough or not. The US Trade Commission is due to rule in February. If this affair is unresolved by Christmas, the government faces an industrial crisis that will make the damage from 2,000 job losses at BAE Systems look mild. HelloFresh stretches the definition of \u2018active\u2019 HelloFresh is the \u201cleading global meal kit service,\u201d which means it delivers ingredients to people who want to cook but can\u2019t be bothered to shop. There is, apparently, a demand for such a service because HelloFresh says it has 1.3 million \u201cactive\u201d customers in 10 countries, including the UK. Now this German company wants to raise \u20ac250m-\u20ac300m (\u00a3225m-\u00a3270m) via a flotation \u201cto propel HelloFresh to the next level\u201d. The chatter says owner Rocket Internet hopes to get the venture valued on the Frankfurt stock exchange at \u20ac1.5bn. Good luck with that. Use of fashionable labels like \u201cdisruptive\u201d and \u201cdata-driven\u201d can\u2019t disguise the fact that HelloFresh is heavily loss-making and has an unproven business model. In 2016, the business made losses of \u20ac94m on revenues of \u20ac597m and, despite the brave talk about reaching break-even in the next 15 months, nobody really knows what will happen when the marketing costs are turned down, as they surely must be at some point. Last year HelloFresh spent an astonishing \u20ac157m on marketing; all those enthusiastic folk knocking on doors to drum up business need to be paid. Rocket has assembled five large international banks to find buyers for the shares, which suggests it knows some heavy lifting is required, especially as US rival Blue Apron\u2019s float was a flop. Let\u2019s hope the banks insist on a tighter definition of an \u201cactive\u201d customer. HelloFresh\u2019s current version includes \u201ccustomers who ordered during the relevant period but discontinued their orders and registration\u201d. We call those ex-customers. People\u2019s Trust looked good \u2013 except for the fees What a shame. Daniel Godfrey has failed to raise sufficient funds for his pioneering People\u2019s Trust investment trust, which was pitched as an antidote to City short-termism and closet index-tracking. He was aiming for \u00a3125m but has fallen short. A market listing has been abandoned. Some may spy the revenge of the City since it seems to have been the institutional money, not the retail, that failed to arrive. Godfrey, remember, was the former chief executive of the Investment Association who upset its fund management members by pointing out that some of their fees may be too high and lack transparency. But that\u2019s probably not the whole story. While the People\u2019s Trust\u2019s structure scored well on transparency and long-termism, the hard reality is that its own annual charge looked high at 1.07%. One day the industry mould will be broken, says Godfrey. Quite possibly \u2013 but the fees will have to be lower.",

      "bodyText": "Network Rail is set to be granted an enhanced budget, likely to be more than \u00a340bn, to run Britain\u2019s railway despite the regulator highlighting more concerns over billions lost due to inefficiency. The government will announce later this week how much it is prepared to spend on maintaining and operating Britain\u2019s railways for the five years from 2019. The figure, the outcome of complex negotiations between the Treasury and Network Rail, is likely to include financing for some projects that lapsed in the current five-year plan, which has been largely torn up. However, the settlement is unlikely to include major rail enhancements, with additional financing for landmark schemes such as the TransPennine route upgrade between Manchester and Leeds expected to be announced separately, early next year. Despite successfully delivering some major projects, such as the \u00a3895m redevelopment of the station and tracks at Reading, Network Rail massively overspent in its last, 2014-19 budget. A tripling of costs on the electrification of the Great Western mainline, saw projects scrapped by the government after the reclassification of Network Rail as a public sector body on the Treasury\u2019s balance sheet. Mark Carne, the chief executive of Network Rail, would not say what sum Network Rail expects to be granted this week. But he admitted: \u201cTwo years ago there was a massive risk of reduced funding. Everyone was shell-shocked after reclassification.\u201d However, sources expect the day-to-day budget to significantly exceed the previous settlement for day-to-day running of the existing network, which was about \u00a325bn of 2014-19\u2019s \u00a338.5bn total budget. The higher figure will partly reflect inflation, the maintenance of new lines, and wear and tear from increased railway usage. But it will also signal a determination in government to invest heavily in the railway after a fractious couple of years. While the Treasury curtailed Network Rail\u2019s borrowing after 2015, its debt has continued to rise by another \u00a34.6bn to \u00a344.8bn in the last year. In its annual assessment, the Office of Rail and Road warned on Tuesday that Network Rail had become less efficient in its core business. The ORR said: \u201cWe estimate that the cost of Network Rail not delivering as much efficiency as we expected is about \u00a33.9bn.\u201d The regulator said that the backlog of work was increasing, with around \u00a33.4bn worth of schemes now deferred to a later date. It warned that plans to sell off land and property to raise cash would probably not reach the target figures, adding: \u201cNetwork Rail will be in a worse position financially [in 2019] than we expected, increasing the financial pressure on the company.\u201d A spokesperson for Network Rail said: \u201cNetwork Rail continues to invest heavily in Britain\u2019s railways and we take our financial responsibilities seriously. Budgets are under constant review to ensure we maximise the value from every pound spent. \u201cAs a result, some non-essential work has been postponed and the money diverted into areas that will have more direct impact for passengers \u2013 improving train performance or helping to fund projects that expand and improve the railway.\u201d",

Workers from Bombardier\u2019s Belfast plant will on Wednesday unfurl a banner outside the Houses of Parliament in London demanding that Theresa May and her ministers do more to safeguard their jobs. Bombardier has been hit by a 300% import levy following a complaint from rival Boeing that the Canadian-owned company had dumped its C Series jets at \u201cabsurdly low\u201d prices. Boeing claims that aid from the UK and Canadian governments amount to illegal subsidy. The workers will demand that May summon Boeing executives to a summit with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and the unions. Steve Turner, the Unite assistant general secretary, said: \u201cThe British government has a duty to defend UK manufacturing jobs against the bullying behaviour of Boeing. \u201cA failure to do so will signal that any ambition ministers have for a coherent industrial strategy is effectively in tatters and that they are happy to put Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policy ahead of UK manufacturing jobs. \u201cBoeing\u2019s case is without merit, a fact that Theresa May has herself admitted.

Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s business secretary, said she feared that Bombardier and its workers \u201care considered a fair price to pay for a post-Brexit trade deal with President Trump by this Conservative government\u201d. Ross Murdoch, a national officer of the GMB union, said: \u201cThe government needs to go beyond fluffy words about everyone uniting and telephone calls from Theresa May to Donald Trump. \u201cOn the basis the US president has refused to intervene, perhaps the relationship is not so special after all.

The village has grown weary of news about job losses down the years: it is part and parcel of having Lancashire\u2019s biggest private sector employer on your doorstep. Still, few expected as many as 750 jobs to be put at risk when the announcement finally came on Tuesday morning. The impact, locals fear, will be immediate. \u201cThis is worrying for the people affected, and until people know what their future looks like, people just stop spending money,\u201d said Mark Menzies, the Conservative MP for Fylde. He remembers when BAE announced 3,000 job losses in 2011 \u2013 half of which would be in Lancashire \u2013 and people simply stopped going out. \u201cEveryone felt it. Shops, taxi firms, restaurants. Within the local economy, there will be an impact overnight.\u201d The defence giant employs 6,000 people in Warton, about 10 miles south-east of Blackpool, where it assembles the Typhoon fighter jet on a heavily fortified aerospace site. Another 4,000 are employed at its site in Samlesbury, between Preston and Blackburn, making BAE by far Lancashire\u2019s biggest private sector employer. Workers leaving the Warton site said they were not allowed to speak to the press on Tuesday afternoon, but locals reacted with a mixture of weary resignation and disappointment at the news. \u201cIt is the employer, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s nothing else,\u201d said David Cookson, a retired farmer, enjoying a lunchtime pint at the Clifton Arms pub directly outside BAE\u2019s Warton gates, where the quiet village life is occasionally disturbed by the ear-splitting roar of a fighter jet leaving its runway. Those with long memories barely blink at the noise \u2013 nor the fuss about job losses. \u201cThere used to be 10,000 workers here, now there\u2019s five or six thousand,\u201d said Cookson, 73. \u201cI know a few of the lads who work there. People travel for miles to come and work here. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever close, it\u2019s just being made a little bit not as big as it was. What can you say? If they\u2019re not selling their Eurofighters, they haven\u2019t got the work. \u201cThis happens all the time here. One minute they\u2019re down on the bones of their arse, the next minute they\u2019ve made orders for multimillions and multibillions of pounds. It\u2019s always been like that. One minute they\u2019re laying them off and then a week later they\u2019re all back in as subcontractors.\u201d In the mornings, Warton\u2019s main thoroughfare, Lytham Road, is a sea of thousands of cars as workers arrive at the plant. At lunchtimes, said Cookson, BAE\u2019s workers used to queue out of the door for a pint at the Clifton Arms. Not any more, he said: \u201cIt used to be mad here, but a few years ago the company said we can\u2019t stop you having a drink at lunchtime but it won\u2019t enhance your prospects. Once you couldn\u2019t get in the door at lunchtime and now there\u2019s just half a dozen in \u2013 the ones in suits, not the bodies on the shop floor.\u201d At McColl\u2019s convenience shop, over the road from the aerodrome, Sophie Bradley, 25, said the loss of hundreds of jobs would affect every business in the area. \u201cI was sad when I heard. It\u2019s going to be a big loss for the area and the businesses. A lot of people will be leaving the area,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody in the village knows someone who works there, either a family member or friend.\u201d As the final assembly line for the Typhoon, this otherwise-quiet Lancashire village has been at the centre of world events with its locally produced fighter jet being used to deadly effect against Islamic State in Syria and, more controversially, by Saudi Arabia in Yemen. Few villagers talk about that though. It is, after all, a big employer and a source of local pride: about 26,000 people attended a rare family open day at the aerospace site the last time BAE held one, in 2006.",

    "webTitle": "Global economic recovery may not last, warns IMF", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has said the global economy\u2019s recent recovery may not last, despite a pickup in activity in all western countries except the UK. Marking the 10th anniversary of the onset of the financial crisis, the IMF said in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) there was a risk that governments could be lulled into a false sense of security by booming markets and policymakers needed to guard against complacency. Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, cited high asset prices, rapid credit growth in China, political turmoil in Catalonia and a cliff-edge Brexit as risks to an improving global outlook. Obstfeld welcomed the speech made by Theresa May in Florence last month in which she said Britain was seeking an implementation period of about two years after the formal date for leaving the EU in March 2019. \u201cWe very much hope these negotiations can be constructive and minimise the costs to both sides\u201d, Obstfeld said. \u201cThat is in everybody\u2019s interest. A cliff-edge Brexit without any formal arrangements would lead to a lot of uncertainty.\u201d The UK\u2019s growth forecast has been cut by 0.3 points to 1.7% since April as a result of the consumer-led slowdown in activity in the first half of the year, caused by the pound\u2019s depreciation. There has been no change in the outlook since the WEO was updated in July and forecasters at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, a UK thinktank, said they expected growth to pick up from 0.3% to 0.4% in the third quarter of 2017. After warning strongly about the risks of a Brexit-induced recession in the run-up to the EU referendum in June 2016, the IMF adopted a more cautious note in the WEO. \u201cThe medium-term growth outlook [for the UK] is highly uncertain and will depend in part on the new economic relationship with the EU and the extent of the increase in barriers to trade, migration and cross-border financial activity,\u201d it said. Six months ago, the IMF predicted that in 2022 the UK would grow by 1.9% but in the expectation that any form of Brexit will be negative for the economy it has now trimmed that forecast to 1.7%. Overall, the IMF said global output growth would increase from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.6% this year and 3.7% in 2018. It upgraded its growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points for this year and next from the last full WEO in April and the update to its forecasts in July. Obstfeld said the state of the world economy was markedly different from 18 months ago, when there was the prospect of stalling growth and financial turbulence. \u201cThe picture now is very different, with accelerating growth in Europe, Japan, China and the United States,\u201d he said, noting that financial markets did not expect higher interest rates in the US or the phasing out of stimulus by the European Central Bank to cause trouble. \u201cThese positive developments give good cause for greater confidence, but neither policymakers nor markets should be lulled into complacency,\u201d Obstfeld said. \u201cA closer look suggests that the global recovery may not be sustainable. Not all countries are participating, inflation often remains below target, with weak wage growth, and the medium-term outlook still disappoints in many parts of the world. \u201cThe recovery is also vulnerable to serious risks. Financial markets that ignore these risks are susceptible to disruptive repricing and are sending a misleading message to policymakers. \u201cPolicymakers, in turn, need to maintain a longer-term vision and seize the current opportunity to implement the structural and fiscal reforms needed for greater resilience, productivity and investment.\u201d Canada will be the fastest-growing G7 economy this year, at 3%, according to the WEO. The US (2.2%) and Germany (2%) are expected to be the next strongest performers, followed by the UK, France (1.6%) and Italy and Japan (both 1.5%). Since April, the IMF has become less optimistic about Donald Trump\u2019s ability to deliver a package of tax cuts and spending increases, and has trimmed its US growth forecast for 2018 by 0.2 points to 2.3%. The fund has revised its forecast for the eurozone up by 0.3 points to 1.9%. Obstfeld said the backlash against globalisation, which had been stoked by stagnant wages and the loss of well-paid, middle-skill jobs, was one of the threats to the global economy. The IMF believes sustaining expansion will require policymakers to avoid protectionist measures and \u201cdo more to ensure that gains from growth are shared more widely\u201d.",

Treasury officials believe the downgrade will wipe out about two-thirds of the government\u2019s \u00a326bn budget surplus from 2017 to 2021. The stockpile, seen as a war chest for a potential slowdown after a disorderly and harmful EU exit, was set aside by the chancellor in the previous budget in March. Hammond is under pressure to increase spending, despite weaker economic readings. The Conservatives pledged to raise it at the party conference in Manchester last week, putting an additional \u00a310bn into its help-to-buy scheme for first-time housebuyers and raising the repayment threshold on student loans. In its seven-year history, the OBR has been forced to heavily revise several assumptions about the economy. Last year, it revised down a forecast for the growth of household debt for the rest of the decade, in response to years of lacklustre increases in mortgage borrowing. The forecaster has also revised down the level of corporate borrowing after companies shied away from using bank loans to make large-scale investments. Critics of the OBR accused it of being overly optimistic in sticking with forecasts that corporate and household borrowing would spur a dramatic revival in the UK\u2019s economic fortunes. Neither materialised and growth from 2014 to 2016 was mainly the result of an increase in real incomes following a slump in inflation. The OBR said its March forecast assumed that trend productivity growth would rise slowly to reach 1.8% in 2021. However, that jars with recent readings, as the rate of labour productivity as measured by output per hour fell by 0.1% in the three months to June, according to the Office for National Statistics. Robert Chote, the OBR chairman, refused to give details about how much his team of analysts, which includes former Bank of England governor Charlie Bean, would cut the forecast for productivity growth, saying that it would be published at the time of the budget. He said: \u201cOur assumption that productivity growth would return to a more normal rate within a few years reflected a judgement that whatever factors were depressing it in the wake of the financial crisis would fade as it receded further into the past. \u201cBut as the period of weak performance gets longer, the explanations that people pointed to immediately after the crisis [for an upturn] look less convincing and others seem more plausible.\u201d Low business investment was cited by the OBR as one of the main reasons for persistently low levels of productivity. And while investment could rebound in the wake of the divorce with the European Union, it seemed more likely that uncertainty would persist, keeping productivity levels depressed. The revisions to productivity growth come after positive monthly readings on the budget deficit \u2013 the gap between government spending and income from tax receipts. It fell to its lowest August total since 2007 after an increase in VAT income and a squeeze on local authority borrowing. They also come as the Bank of England considers putting up interest rates from as early as next month in an attempt to head off the recent rise in inflation, which has squeezed living standards. Although the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, wage growth still lags behind the rising cost of living.",

      "bodyText": "The boss of Deliveroo has warned MPs that if the company is forced to give workers basic rights such as the minimum wage and holiday and sick pay it will pass the cost on to consumers by raising the cost of delivery by \u00a31. Dan Warne, Deliveroo\u2019s managing director of the UK and Ireland, told parliament\u2019s business committee that the cost of providing rights to workers would be borne by customers ordering takeaways. Uber, which was last month stripped off its London licence to operate, said employing its 50,000 self-employed drivers would cost the company millions of pounds a year. Andrew Byrne, Uber\u2019s head of policy, said: \u201cI don\u2019t have the precise figures \u2026 but I\u2019m certain it would be the tens of millions, certainly.\u201d Uber is awaiting a court ruling on whether its drivers should be granted workers\u2019 rights. Two drivers won a landmark ruling last year that found Uber drivers should be treated as employees and entitled to the minimum wage and holiday pay. Uber is appealing against the ruling. The decision, expected before Christmas, could have wide-ranging implications for companies in the \u201cgig economy\u201d. A government review of new working practices by former Tony Blair aide Matthew Taylor said all jobs should be \u201cfair and decent\u201d and recommended that workers at gig economy employers should be classified as dependent contractors rather than self-employed. Byrne admitted to MPs that the company had shown \u201cthe wrong attitude\u201d on a number of issues, but could now see a path forward with Transport for London to address the regulator\u2019s concerns. TfL refused to renew Uber\u2019s licence on the grounds of \u201cpublic safety and security implications\u201d relating to issues such as the reporting of serious criminal offences. Labour MP Peter Kyle asked why Uber had been so \u201caggressive\u201d in its response to Transport for London. \u201cYour initial reaction was that TfL is putting 40,000 people out of business,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are going to court denying responsibility for those people in the first place.\u201d Byrne said: \u201cThe company accepts that in lots of places it has had the wrong attitude and needs to change.\u201d Byrne said a modification to the app would automatically log off drivers who had been online for 10-12 hours and would ensure that drivers take sufficient breaks. He said Uber was also providing more training and was helping drivers to save for ISAs and pensions. Parcel delivery firm Hermes, which was found in a Guardian investigation to be paying some of its couriers below the \u201cnational living wage\u201d, said it would cost \u00a358.8m annually to employ its 15,000 staff, including \u00a332m in national insurance contributions. Hugo Martin, the Hermes director of legal affairs, apologised to MPs over the treatment of some drivers in the past, including the cancellation of a driver\u2019s contract because he was unable to work due to the premature birth of a child. Labour MP Anna Turley said a Hermes worker had told the committee that a worker who was rushed to hospital because of a premature birth had their contract cancelled. \u201cThe boss essentially said \u2018That\u2019s it, your contract is cancelled. We\u2019re not using you any more,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe words were \u2018parcels come first.\u2019\u201d Martin said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the revelations, adding that such incidents were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and managers would be disciplined. He said Hermes now has a network of back-up drivers to provide cover in emergencies if couriers were unable to find someone else to do their round. Kyle said evidence from employees suggested that for Hermes couriers, \u201clife has to fit around the work\u201d. \u201cThere is a chasm between what you are saying and the life you are describing of the couriers and the one we are hearing about,\u201d he added.",

Better than expected industrial production figures helped outweigh a jump in the UK trade deficit. But European markets edged lower on uncertainty ahead of the Catalan parliament discussing independence. (Our live blog on the meeting is here.) The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up 30.38 points or 0.4% at 7538.27 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.21% to 12,949.25 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.04% at 5363.65 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.63% to 22,335.91 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.92% at 10,142.3 In Greece, the Athens market added 0.65% to 755.03 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 28 points or 0.13%. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The IMF predictions are too pessimistic for the UK and too optimistic for China and India, says Nikita Shah at Capital Economics, who is also more optimistic about a fiscal stimulus in the US next year: The Fund dropped its assumption of a fiscal expansion taking place [in the US], due to \u201csignificant policy uncertainty\u201d. We think that Congress will pass a small fiscal stimulus early next year and that this will help to boost US GDP growth to 2.5% in 2018, a touch higher than the IMF\u2019s forecast of 2.3%. [On the UK] the headlines focussed on the 0.3pps downgrade to the IMF\u2019s 2017 UK growth forecast from its projection in April. But this was partly due to the Fund catching up with weaker-than-expected growth early this year, which we had already incorporated in our forecasts. And although the IMF attributed this slowdown in the UK to the long-term adverse impact of Brexit starting to show, we think it instead reflects the (temporary) impact of the lower pound on consumers. Indeed, our forecast for GDP growth in 2018 of 2.2% is significantly higher than the IMF\u2019s of 1.5%... Our forecasts for the major emerging economies differ significantly from the IMF\u2019s. Our view is that GDP growth in both China and India will be 6.0% this year, which is slower than the IMF\u2019s forecasts of 6.8% and downwardly-revised 6.7%, respectively. In contrast, we expect the recoveries in Brazil and Russia\u2019s economies to be stronger than the IMF expects. The IMF\u2019s growth forecasts suggest the global economy could be getting back to normal after the battering it received during the financial crisis, suggests Aviva Investors. Senior economist Stewart Robertson said: After five years (2013-2017 inclusive) when the IMF routinely revised its global growth expectations lower, they have for the second time in a row revised it higher for the year ahead. The differences may be quite small, but the fact they are in a positive direction is news in itself. Having got used to regular disappointments, successive growth upgrades are an indication that things are perhaps changing in a good way \u2013 the economic expansion has become more entrenched. Solid foundations now provide a sound base for ongoing growth and slow normalisation after ten-years of doubt and setback. At today\u2019s press conference in Washington the IMF was keen to highlight that growth outcomes in the first half of 2017 were stronger than expected and also that the continuing economic recovery had become more broad-based. This being the IMF, however, it was not all good news. It was noticeable that compared to as recently as July, the UK was the only major developed nation not to receive an upward growth revision. The reasons for this are well-documented, largely the result of weaker consumer spending. Looking further ahead, the IMF referred to the \u201chighly uncertain\u201d medium-term outlook, a direct consequence of Brexit. The last time that Britain was such a notable underperformer was in the dark days of the 1970s. Let\u2019s hope it is cyclical this time, not structural. The IMF also stressed that \u201cthe recovery is not complete\u201d. This is a strange choice of phrase, suggesting that there is a standard template for economic revivals. As any student of economic history will tell you, they are all different. Variations on a theme perhaps, but this one especially is treading a great deal of new ground. The themes that the IMF chooses to draw special attention to in advanced nations are below-target inflation in several countries and weak productivity growth and rising old-age dependency. We believe that global inflation will return gradually as long as growth continues, but recognise that the longer-term supply-side issues will be an enduring challenge for the decades to come. More from Ireland: There were two new initiatives in the Irish budget prompted by concerns over public health. First, a Sugar Tax of 30 cents per litre on soft drinks which have between five and eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres in them. The Irish Heart Foundation described the imposition of the tax as a \u201clandmark day in the fight against obesity.\u201d Sunbeds and tanning salons have been hit with extra VAT charges rising from 13.5 per cent to 23 per cent. The Irish government said this was in line with its National Cancer Strategy to reduce cancer particular of the skin. It is the most common form of cancer in Ireland. The IMF\u2019s forecasts have had little impact on the markets, reckons Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: [The IMF} was relatively upbeat this Tuesday, stating that the world economy should grow by 3.7% in 2017, up from 3.2% in 2016, while maintaining those levels in 2018. However, the IMF wasn\u2019t so positive about the UK, stating it was an \u2018exception\u2019 to the overall chirpy outlook due to the uncertainty of Brexit, and the subsequent impact on wages and household spending. Yet...none of this made too much difference to investors. Cable continued to chug along with a 0.3% to 0.4% rise, while sterling dipped 0.1% to 0.2% against the euro. The FTSE rode the pound\u2019s inconsistent performance to a 20 point increase, while the DAX and CAC fell 0.4% and 0.2% respectively off the back of the euro\u2019s half a percent jump against the dollar (a move that was already in place before the IMF upgraded the Eurozone\u2019s growth forecasts). Market-wise the biggest news was probably that the Dow Jones hit a fresh all-time high. But even this was pretty lame, the index briefly spiking to 22850 before settling back below 22800. More on the Irish budget. Henry McDonald writes: Ireland\u2019s budget for 2018 has included some extra measures to help smaller and medium businesses cope with the impact of Brexit. Paschal Donohoe, Irish Finance Minister, has announced a Brexit Loan Scheme for the small business sector in the Republic. SME\u2019s employ 69 per cent of the Irish workforce. \u20ac25m is being set aside to help small businesses in the agri-food sector. The body that promotes trade across the Irish Sea has welcomed the loan scheme. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce said the loan scheme would give the SME sector \u201cthe means to adequately prepare for Brexit [and] is vital as part of our national effort to mitigate the negative impacts of Brexit.\u201d Another major headline figure in the budget has been a promised \u20ac1.8bn for housing. There has been massive pressure on the Fine Gael minority government to start building more public housing in response to rising rents, soaring mortgage costs and the fact that there are 3,000 children currently living in emergency accommodation in Dublin. He is asked about his first impressions of Donald Trump\u2019s tax plans, and if he won\u2019t answer that, could he say what would be an appropriate plan? Obstfeld says, \u201cAren\u2019t we on the second impression at least?\u201d He says he won\u2019t indeed answer the first part of the question. He says there is a lot yet to be determined in the tax plan, people might think it is just detail but it is quite crucial to how the thing will work and what deficit or surplus in the government budget it will lead to. As a general priniple, he says, simplification is a good thing; if it brings a sharp reduction in exemptions, loopholes, special giveaways allowing a reduction in rates, that is a good thing. \u201cWe are increasingly aware that tax systems have to be cogniscent of how they affect inequality.\u201d They need to be attuned to the needs of the middle class and those below the median. What happens with government revenues is important as well, do you invest in infrastructure, people. Where the US is, he adds, we feel that whatever the tax reform plan, it should not increase the deficit, tax reform should be revenue enhancing. The US could usefully use more revenue. And the press conference ends. The Guardian\u2019s Larry Elliott asks about the risks to the outlook that the IMF has identified, and says the financial markets do not seem to be taking these on board. Are the markets being irrationally exhuberant? Obstfeld jokes that it is fitting that Richard Thaler won the economics Nobel prize yesterday ( irrationality being one of his themes) although he adds \u201che wan\u2019t the irrational exhuberance guy\u201d (that was of course Alan Greenspan.) He adds, \u201cIt is always difficult to determine what a fair asset price is in a rigorous way [but] when you view a number of indices at historic highs, you have to wonder. \u201cTo some degree [markets] are supported by low interest rates, and growth expectations which could be disappointed.\u201d He says the IMF\u2019s longer term growth rates, especially in advanced economies, could see a slowdown, and if interest rates rise more quickly than expected, there could be \u201can abrupt repricing [of assets] which could be disruptive.\u201d We are not ready to make a judgement that assets are overpriced. he adds, but we are ready to say there are risks and there could be a downward adjustment. The IMF is asked about the effects of the recent hurricanes and tropical storms. Obstfeld says they will obviously have a big impact on the regional outlook, less so on the global outlook. He says, \u201cWe stand ready with our rapid financing facility if that is needed.\u201d Going forward, if some events become more routine - with theories as to why, some linked to climate change - the international community has to think about what kind of support it can give to communities...the suffering is quite grave. Wall Street has opened higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up around 55 points or 0.25%. On the US: The IMF is asked by a Portuguese journalist about the situation in Catalonia. Obstfeld says the situation in Spain is concerning, there is a lot of uncertainty, and we can only hope the parties do not act precipitously [but] negotiate. There are a lot of potential gains on both sides if they do settle. There would probably be spillovers [from the Catalonia situation] to Portugal and other countries in Europe. The IMF are now taking questions on the world economic outlook. The panel is asked about Brexit, and the impact on the UK and European economies if no deal is agreed? Maurice Obstfeld, the IMF\u2019s economic counsellor, said, \u201cWe very much hope negotiations can be constructive and minimise the costs to both sides.\u201d But the clock is short, he added, especially as whatever deal there is has to be approved by the 27 members of the EU. He said Theresa May\u2019s speech in Florence was very constructive, when she suggested a two year transition period. That could be a good thing, he said, if it allows more time for adjustments, given there is a clear process in getting to the end point. And here is Larry Elliott\u2019s analysis of the IMF report: Ahead of its annual meeting in Washington later this week, the International Monetary Fund has issued its latest update on the global economy. Larry Elliott writes: The International Monetary Fund has said the global economy\u2019s recent recovery may not last, despite a pickup in activity in all western countries except the UK. Marking the 10th anniversary of the onset of the financial crisis, the IMF said there was a risk that governments could be lulled into a false sense of security by booming markets and policymakers needed to guard against complacency. The Washington-based fund said in its half-yearly World Economic Outlook (WEO) that global output growth would increase from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.6% this year and 3.7% in 2018. It upgraded its growth forecast by 0.1 percentage points for this year and next from the last full WEO in April and the update to its forecasts in July. The full story is here: If NIESR\u2019s estimate is right, the UK economy probably grew slower than the rest of Europe, for the third quarter in a row. Just in: Britain\u2019s economy probably grew by 0.4% in the last three months. That\u2019s according to the latest monthly forecasts from the NIESR thinktank. If NIESR are right, that means the UK\u2019s growth rate has picked up a little, from 0.3% in the second quarter of 2017. Any increase in growth is welcome, but this would still be below the UK\u2019s recent trend growth. Amit Kara, head of UK macroeconomic forecasting at NIESR, explains: Although economic growth is likely to be a touch stronger in the second half of this year compared with the first, it is important to note that activity has slowed since last year and this at a time when real GDP growth in other major economies such as the Euro Area and the USA has strengthened. Looking ahead, we expect the pattern of demand in the UK economy to rebalance towards international trade in response to strengthening global growth and weaker sterling and away from domestic demand. Kara adds that there is a \u201cstrong chance\u201d that UK interest rates will be increased in November, if next week\u2019s data shows that inflation has risen and the labour market is still strong. Over in parliament, business minister Claire Perry has told MPs that the government \u201cstands ready\u201d to help BAE Systems workers. Perry said the government would work to avoid compulsory redundancies at the company (but isn\u2019t giving much detail about how, exactly). She is being criticised by opposition MPs for not supporting the company. In response, Perry denied that UK defence spending changes were responsible for the 2,000 job cuts announced today. There\u2019s no lack of productivity at the OBR, though. They\u2019ve created a handy little video on Britain\u2019s productivity problems: Over in Ireland, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says there will be \u201cno bonanza\u201d and \u201cno fireworks\u201d in today\u2019s budget. Speaking before a pre-budget cabinet meeting this Tuesday morning, Varadkar the latest financial measures would mark another \u201csmall sustainable step in the right direction for our country.\u201d His finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, is expected to announce modest tax cuts for middle income earners in Ireland of up to \u20ac250 per year. Donohoe\u2019s budget has been backed by the Independent Alliance and the main opposition party, Fianna Fail. Fianna Fail operates a similar policy of confidence and supply to the Fine Gael minority government that the Democratic Unionist Party uses to keep Theresa May and the Tories in power. The highlights the budget for 2018 in Ireland are expected to be: A rise in the Irish minimum wage by 30 cents to \u20ac9.55 per hour. A hike in stamp duty tax on commercial property sales by 5 per cent which could raise up to \u20ac400m for the Irish Exchequer. Tax cuts including the slashing of the Universal Social Charge that was imposed on Ireland by the IMF and ECB when the country was bailed out of national bankruptcy. \u20ac25 million allocated to the farming sector to help farmers with the fall out from Brexit. A sugar tax will be imposed but won\u2019t be implemented until April next year. Fifty cents put onto a packet of twenty cigarettes, bringing the price to \u20ac11 for the first time. No rises in the price of alcoholic drinks. The solution to Britain\u2019s productivity problem must include raising skills levels among the nation\u2019s workers, says TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cBritain\u2019s productivity headache is a self-inflicted wound. Years of cuts, low public investment, and rising job insecurity have taken a heavy toll. \u201cMinisters need to return to the drawing board. Our yawning productivity gap is holding our economy back. \u201cWith Brexit fast approaching, we urgently need to create more highly-skilled jobs. And improve workforce training and engagement.\u201d Making predictions is very difficult, especially about the future, as the old saying has it. The OBR doesn\u2019t shy away from this either. Today\u2019s report shows how it has been too optimistic about UK growth and business investment, and also expected interest rates to be rather higher today. Heads-up: I\u2019ve just posted a new version of the UK trade data chart (in the 9.58am post) showing how imports hit a record high in August. You might need to refresh to see it. The OBR says there are several reasons why UK productivity growth has been so disappointing. 1) Firms aren\u2019t spending enough on new equipment and infrastructure. Business investment today is just 5 per cent above its pre-crisis peak almost a decade ago, compared to 63% after the 1980s recession. 2) Zombie firms are clinging onto life. Record low interest rates mean that companies who would normally have gone bust are still operating, but not contributing much. 3) Brexit uncertainty is making bosses cautious. OK, this only explains recent productivity problems, but it\u2019s possible that companies are choosing to hire workers, who can be laid off easily, rather than investing in new capital. Here\u2019s the end result: Lower productivity = lower economic growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility has announced that it expects to \u201csignificantly\u201d downgrade its estimates of Britain\u2019s potential productivity growth. The fiscal watchdog, which is independent of the government, has admitted that it has been too optimistic over productivity for many years. It now plans to make amends at the next budget, in November. This is a serious blow to chancellor Philip Hammond - weak productivity means slower growth, and thus erodes the size of his war chest to help the UK economy. In a new report, the OBR points out that productivity has lagged its forecasts since 2010, while employment and average hours worked have both exceeded forecasts. The OBR says : While we continue to believe that there will be some recovery from the very weak productivity performance of recent years, the continued disappointing outturns, together with the likelihood that heightened uncertainty will continue to weigh on investment, means that we anticipate significantly reducing our assumption for potential productivity growth over the next five years in our forthcoming November 2017 Economic and Fiscal Outlook. So why is UK productivity so bad, and what did the OBR get wrong? The watchdog says it had expected productivity rise as firms stopped \u2018hoarding labour\u2019 after the financial crisis and invested in new machinery instead. It also hoped that it would pick up once banks were strong enough to lend more to the real economy. But this hasn\u2019t happened.... In a blow to Britain\u2019s manufacturing base, arms manufacturer BAE has announced plans to cut almost 2,000 jobs. The axe will fall heavily on BAE\u2019s factories in Lancashire, including its site at Warton on the outskirts of Preston. The company is blaming a decline in orders for its Eurofighter Typhoon. It has also suffered from public sector spending cuts since the financial crisis. Unions are urging the government to help the company by committing to new orders soon. Here\u2019s the full story: This morning\u2019s trade, industrial production and construction data paint a mixed picture of the UK economy, says Kate Davies of the Office for National Statistics. You can see the UK trade data yourself, here. The Sun\u2019s political editor is also struck by the rise in EU exports: Britain\u2019s trade figures are no better if you strip out \u2018erratic\u2019 elements, such as trade in gold, precious stones and aircraft, and oil. In better news, UK manufacturing output rose by 0.4% in August, better than expected. That means British factories have enjoyed their best quarter of growth since February. The country\u2019s builders also had a better month; construction output rose by 0.65 in August, the first increased since May. This may encourage the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee to raise interest rates next month. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management, explains: \u201cIndustrial Production rose by 0.9% in the three months to August, with the largest contribution coming from manufacturing. Construction output also picked up slightly in August, boosted by infrastructure and private house building. These figures will feed into the first estimate of Q3 GDP, ahead of the next MPC meeting in November. A majority on the MPC appear committed to a rate hike at that meeting, which is now 80% priced in by the market.\u201d Labour MP Stephen Doughty says the widening of Britain\u2019s trade deficit is \u201calarming news\u201d, and shows the dangers of leaving the EU single market. \u201cWe were repeatedly told that crashing the pound would result in a major boost for British exports. But 15 months on we are still waiting, as Britain\u2019s trade deficit with the rest of the world continues to widen. \u201cThese figures only serve to underline how reckless it is for the Government to be wrenching the UK out of the Single Market, our largest export market right on our doorstep, in pursuit of fantasy trade deals on the other side of the world.\u201d This is from Andy Bruce of Reuters: Brexit didn\u2019t stop the UK expanding its exports to other European countries over the last three months. Today\u2019s report shows that Britain sold an extra \u00a31.7bn of goods to the EU in June-August, but suffered a drop in sales to the rest of the world. The ONS says: Exports of goods to non-EU countries decreased by \u00a34.0 billion (8.8%) between the three months to May 2017 and the three months to August 2017. As shown in Figure 2, almost half was due to a decrease in fuel exports (\u00a31.9 billion). Exports of goods to the EU increased by \u00a31.7 billion (4.1%) between the three months to May 2017 and the three months to August 2017, due to machinery and transport equipment exports increasing by \u00a30.8 billion, and smaller increases elsewhere. In total, the UK exported \u00a342.7bn of goods to the EU in June, July and August, and imported \u00a366.6bn. The widening of Britain\u2019s trade deficit last month is a disappointment, says Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce. Thiru writes: Taken together with the recent widening of the current account deficit, the figures paint a rather gloomy picture of the UK\u2019s external position. \u201cThe latest trade data is further evidence that the decline in sterling\u2019s value over the past year is doing little to boost the UK\u2019s overall trade position. Businesses continue to report that the post-EU referendum weakness in sterling is hurting as much as its helping, with firms continuing to face higher input costs due to the weakening currency, particularly those locked into global supply chains. For those companies that rely on overseas suppliers for their production equipment, a weak pound also makes investment in growth less viable. As Ben Chu of the Independent points out, the drop in the pound last year hasn\u2019t revitalised Britain\u2019s exports: Britain\u2019s imports of goods from the EU hit a record high last month. The UK imported \u00a322bn of physical items from Europe in August, but only exported \u00a314bn, according to today\u2019s report. That highlights the importance of Britain\u2019s economy to the rest of Europe. Brexit supporters will argue that this should help Theresa May cut a good trade deal..... But the UK also imported \u00a319bn of goods from outside the EU -- which is also a record high -- while exporting \u00a313.8bn. That\u2019s why Britain\u2019s overall goods deficit hit a record high last month, as this chart shows: Breaking: Britain\u2019s trade in goods deficit with the rest of the world has hit a record high. The gap between what the UK bought and sold widened to \u00a314.245 in August, the Office for National Statistics reports. That\u2019s much bigger than expected, and up from \u00a312.8bn in July. Imports surged by 4.2% during the month, due to higher imports of chemicals, machinery and textiles. Exports, though, only rose by 0.7% during the month. Despite a surplus in services trade, the overall UK trade deficit has now widened to \u00a35.626bn, the biggest reading in 12 months. Over the last three months, the total UK trade deficit in goods and services widened by \u00a32.9 billion to \u00a310.8 billion. More to follow. The pound is creeping higher in early trading, gaining 0.4 of a cent to almost $1.319. That\u2019s its highest level since last Wednesday, when Theresa May\u2019s \u2018nightmare\u2019 party conference speech sparked speculation over her future. Domino\u2019s Pizza shares are having a sizzling morning, jumping almost 11% in early trading and outperforming the rest of the London market. Traders are pleased that it is pressing on with 90 new UK store openings this year, despite warning that British consumers are \u201cuncertain\u201d. Sales across the fast food group jumped by 20% in the last quarter, with UK online sales also strong. Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Domino\u2019s is fighting off rising competition: Domino\u2019s is a cash generative business model and significant potential to add new stores in the UK and overseas. Domino\u2019s are winning market share in the pizza delivery sector, not least due to the strength of their online ordering platform, which saw online sales in the UK rise 17.4%. In Q3, Domino\u2019s turned up the marketing heat, with a \u201cDine for \u00a39.99\u201d offer and customers responded strongly, despite increasing competition in the online food delivery sector from Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats. Elsewhere, after a mixed session in Asia, European stock markets are pretty flat. The FTSE 100 has inched up a bit, but Spain\u2019s IBEX has lost 0.4% amid Catalonian worries. Economics blogger Jeroen Blokland is impressed by this morning\u2019s German trade figures: Just in: French industrial production fell unexpectedly in August, by 0.3% Manufacturing output dropped too, by 0.4%. Economists had expected industrial output to have risen by 0.4%, so this indicates that France\u2019s economy may have softened a little last summer. Germany\u2019s trade surplus has widened again, as Europe\u2019s largest economy continues to enjoy a good year. New figures released this morning show that seasonally adjusted exports rose by 3.1% in August, the biggest rise in a year, while imports only rose by 1.2%. That shows that the stronger euro isn\u2019t preventing German firms from racking up new business. It pushed the German trade surplus up to \u20ac21.6bn, from \u20ac19.3bn in July. On an annual basis, exports were 7.2% higher than a year ago: Whil Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK trade is on everyone\u2019s mind right now, with the Brexit negotiations struggling to make meaningful progress and the risks of no deal rising. So economists will be poring over the latest trade figures, due this morning, to see what shape Britain\u2019s economy is in. The City predicts that Britain ran up a trade deficit of around \u00a32.8bn, close to the \u00a32.87bn incurred in July. That is due to an estimated trade on goods deficit of around \u00a311.2bn, as Britain continued to buy in much more stuff than she produces. But this will probably be partially balanced by the service sector\u2019s traditional surplus. The figures will also show how dependent Britain was on imports and exports with the European Union. Recent figures have shown that UK exports to the EU have risen since the referendum, while the deficit with the rest of the world has dropped. That could change, though, if new restrictions are imposed on trade across the Channel from 2019 if a transition deal isn\u2019t agreed (as the government warned yesterday). Here\u2019s a tweet from a month ago, showing the situation in July: The ONS will also report how Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector fared in August. Industrial production is expected to grow by 0.2% during the month, as the weaker pound helped factories to sell their wares (and pushed up the cost of imported raw materials). New industrial production reports from across the eurozone will give an international comparison.... Britain\u2019s productivity problems will also come under the microscope today, when the the Office for Budget Responsibility publishes its annual forecast evaluation report. Britain\u2019s fiscal watchdog will probably admit that it has overestimated UK productivity growth for several years, which means the economy is in worse shape than we thought. That will be followed by a new estimate of how fast (or slow?) Britain\u2019s economy grew in the last three months. The NIESR thinktank is expected to estimate growth of around 0.3% in July-September. Then, the International Monetary Fund issues its own healthcheck on the global economy, the World Economic Outlook, at 2pm BS (9am in Washington). This will show the Fund\u2019s latest growth forecasts, and also highlight the key risks that could spark a downturn, or even a new financial crisis. Elsewhere, Britain\u2019s BAE Systems may announce sweeping job cuts at its aerospace and naval servicing operation today. On the corporate side, Domino\u2019s Pizza has reported another quarter of growth, up 12% in the UK. European stock markets look quiet, with the FTSE 100 expected to drop by just 6 points at the open to 7501. Traders will be watching Spain closely, where the President of Catalonia will address the region\u2019s parliament later today. Here\u2019s the agenda: 9.30: Office for National Statistics publishes UK trade, industrial production and construction output data for August 11am: Britain\u2019s Office For Budget Responsibility releases its latest Forecast evaluation report, showing how its forecasts compared with reality. 1pm: The National Institute of Economic and Social Research estimates UK growth in the last three months. 1pm: Ireland presents its 2018 budget 2pm: International Monetary Fund releases the latest World Economic Outlook",

We think that Congress will pass a small fiscal stimulus early next year and that this will help to boost US GDP growth to 2.5% in 2018, a touch higher than the IMF\u2019s forecast of 2.3%.</p> <p>[On the UK] the headlines focussed on the 0.3pps downgrade to the IMF\u2019s 2017 UK growth forecast from its projection in April. But this was partly due to the Fund catching up with weaker-than-expected growth early this year, which we had already incorporated in our forecasts. And although the IMF attributed this slowdown in the UK to the long-term adverse impact of Brexit starting to show, we think it instead reflects the (temporary) impact of the lower pound on consumers. Indeed, our forecast for GDP growth in 2018 of 2.2% is significantly higher than the IMF\u2019s of 1.5%...</p> <p>Our forecasts for the major emerging economies differ significantly from the IMF\u2019s. Our view is that GDP growth in both China and India will be 6.0% this year, which is slower than the IMF\u2019s forecasts of 6.8% and downwardly-revised 6.7%, respectively. In contrast, we expect the recoveries in Brazil and Russia\u2019s economies to be stronger than the IMF expects. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59dce010e4b0c8da8831d8b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-10T15:02:20.149Z\">4.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The IMF\u2019s growth forecasts suggest the global economy could be getting back to normal after the battering it received during the financial crisis, suggests Aviva Investors. </strong>Senior economist Stewart Robertson said:</p> <blockquote> <p>After five years (2013-2017 inclusive) when the IMF routinely revised its global growth expectations lower, they have for the second time in a row revised it higher for the year ahead. The differences may be quite small, but the fact they are in a positive direction is news in itself. Having got used to regular disappointments, successive growth upgrades are an indication that things are perhaps changing in a good way \u2013 the economic expansion has become more entrenched. Solid foundations now provide a sound base for ongoing growth and slow normalisation after ten-years of doubt and setback.</p> <p>At today\u2019s press conference in Washington the IMF was keen to highlight that growth outcomes in the first half of 2017 were stronger than expected and also that the continuing economic recovery had become more broad-based. This being the IMF, however, it was not all good news. It was noticeable that compared to as recently as July, the UK was the only major developed nation <em>not</em> to receive an upward growth revision. The reasons for this are well-documented, largely the result of weaker consumer spending. Looking further ahead, the IMF referred to the \u201chighly uncertain\u201d medium-term outlook, a direct consequence of Brexit. The last time that Britain was such a notable underperformer was in the dark days of the 1970s. Let\u2019s hope it is cyclical this time, not structural.</p> <p>The IMF also stressed that \u201cthe recovery is not complete\u201d. This is a strange choice of phrase, suggesting that there is a standard template for economic revivals. As any student of economic history will tell you, they are all different. Variations on a theme perhaps, but this one especially is treading a great deal of new ground. The themes that the IMF chooses to draw special attention to in advanced nations are below-target inflation in several countries and weak productivity growth and rising old-age dependency. We believe that global inflation will return gradually as long as growth continues, but recognise that the longer-term supply-side issues will be an enduring challenge for the decades to come.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59dcdeede4b0c8da8831d8a9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/henrymcdonald\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-10T14:57:13.133Z\">3.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More from Ireland:</p> <blockquote> <p>There were two new initiatives in the Irish budget prompted by concerns over public health.</p> <p>First, a Sugar Tax of 30 cents per litre on soft drinks which have between five and eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres in them.</p> <p>The Irish Heart Foundation described the imposition of the tax as a \u201clandmark day in the fight against obesity.\u201d</p> <p>Sunbeds and tanning salons have been hit with extra VAT charges rising from 13.5 per cent to 23 per cent.

Cable continued to chug along with a 0.3% to 0.4% rise, while sterling dipped 0.1% to 0.2% against the euro. The FTSE rode the pound\u2019s inconsistent performance to a 20 point increase, while the DAX and CAC fell 0.4% and 0.2% respectively off the back of the euro\u2019s half a percent jump against the dollar (a move that was already in place before the IMF upgraded the Eurozone\u2019s growth forecasts).</p> <p>Market-wise the biggest news was probably that the Dow Jones hit a fresh all-time high.

      "bodyText": "There is a moment when gamblers realise that betting on the same horse after a string of losses is hopeless. That moment has arrived at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) after officials at the government\u2019s economic forecaster finally gave up betting that Britain\u2019s labour productivity was about to race to the head of the international pack. After seven years of predictions that it would bounce back from virtually zero to nearer the 2.1% average seen in the pre-crisis period, the OBR has thrown in the towel. Few would consider the OBR as a home for speculators and cardsharps, ready to bet their futures, and the country\u2019s, on a rebound over the next five years in the output of the average worker. Yet the turnaround reveals a huge amount of wishful thinking. Officials now say that the productive capacity of the economy \u2013 as measured by the output of the average worker per hour worked \u2013 will be closer to the 0.2% seen this year than the 1.6% it predicted. As for a reversion to the 2.1% growth seen before the 2008 crash, that is for the birds. The impact is likely to be devastating for the chancellor, who must now make his calculations for spending based on much lower forecasts for tax income. When most of the government\u2019s revenue comes from the two giants of income tax and national insurance, and wages growth is linked to improving levels of productivity, it is not hard to join the dots and see that tax receipts will grow at a slower pace than previously expected. Philip Hammond thought he could deploy about \u00a326bn over the next five years to help him through a difficult Brexit transition with some left over for investment. It looks like about \u00a318bn of that will fail to materialise. The OBR explains the permanent damage to productivity is mainly the result of weak business investment. Even after a 40% rise from the post-crisis low, business investment today is just 5% above its pre-crisis peak almost a decade ago. This contrasts with the decades that followed the 1980s and 1990s recessions, when investment was 63% and 30% higher than the pre-recession peaks respectively. \u201cIf business investment remains weak then this factor should continue to reduce productivity growth relative to the pre-crisis period,\u201d the OBR says in its report. Unfortunately, business investment is a key factor in the improving fortunes of the country that the OBR has also overestimated. Like productivity, it was always supposed to bounce back, but didn\u2019t. Shockingly, if the productivity growth seen in the pre-crisis era had continued, the level would be 21% higher today. Should this mea culpa damage our view of the OBR and its ability to tell us the likely path of the economy? The answer must be yes, when there was plenty of evidence, both theoretical and from the real economy, that showed the financial crisis was the spark for an extraordinary recession, unlike those of the recent past. And for that reason, the recovery would be long and slow, and not the rapid return to form as the OBR said. Austerity was always going to have a bigger impact on business and household sentiment about the health of the nation than the OBR was prepared to acknowledge. With austerity a feature of the government\u2019s financial planning until at least 2025, it is only right that those who gambled on a return to old ways were trounced by the realists.",

In 2007, the IMF ended up with its reputation severely tarnished after failing to notice that the global economy was about to suffer its biggest recession since the 1930s Great Depression. Like many other forecasters, the fund got carried away as the global economy posted its four strongest years of growth since the early 1970s. Only in retrospect did the IMF twig that the rapid expansion was the result of reckless financial speculation, and admit that it had been guilty of groupthink. This time, the message is clear. This is not a case of see the new IMF, same as the old IMF. The warning has gone out loud, clear and early: be careful, because the long-awaited upswing in the global economy may not be for real. The fund\u2019s concern is that wage growth and inflation have remained weak, despite a prolonged period of ultra-low interest rates and the use of quantitative easing (QE), the money-creation process used by the world\u2019s leading central banks in an attempt to stimulate activity. Asset prices have risen sharply as a result of this stimulus. But the IMF fears that amid the euphoria, financial markets are ignoring the risks, just as they did in the buildup to the crisis in 2007. What\u2019s more, central banks and finance ministries have used up much of their ammunition in the past decade. There is little or no scope to cut interest rates, QE has long since been subject to the law of diminishing returns, and governments are running much bigger budget deficits. The IMF\u2019s more measured approach also extends to Brexit, where it has abandoned the line repeated in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum that a vote to leave would result in instant economic armageddon. To be sure, since the last WEO in April, the IMF has cut its growth forecast for the UK from 2% to 1.7%, but still reckons the outlook is better than it thought a year ago. At that stage, the IMF was pencilling in growth of 1.1% for Britain this year. The fund\u2019s public statements on Brexit reflect the change in the government\u2019s own approach. Before the referendum, George Osborne was delighted when the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, issued her dire warnings about imminent economic meltdown. Indeed, the stronger the language, the more the then chancellor liked it. The IMF\u2019s current view is that the economic risks of Brexit will be minimised if the UK remains an open economy and has trading arrangements with the EU that largely mirror current ones. That also happens to be the view of Osborne\u2019s successor, Philip Hammond, who could do without a blood-curdling assessment from the fund at this juncture.",

    "webTitle": "BAE Systems to cut nearly 2,000 UK jobs", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest defence contractor, BAE Systems, is to cut nearly 2,000 jobs in a significant blow to the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector and the government\u2019s industrial strategy. The company, which makes the Eurofighter Typhoon jet and Britain\u2019s nuclear submarines, said on Tuesday that up to 1,400 jobs would go at its military aerospace business over the next three years, along with a further 375 in maritime services and 150 at its cyber-intelligence business. BAE aims to achieve the cuts, which are due to be implemented by 1 January and will affect managers as well as people working on the production line, through voluntary redundancies where possible. It employs 83,100 people worldwide, including 34,600 in the UK. Its aerospace bases at Warton, where parts for the Typhoon are made and assembled, and Samlesbury in Lancashire, which together employ 10,000 people, will see 750 job losses, twice as many as in 2015. Its other aerospace base, in Brough, east Yorkshire, which makes parts for the Hawk, will see its 900-member workforce almost halved to 500, another severe blow to the region after 500 job losses at the site four years ago. A further 340 dockyard job cuts are going in Portsmouth as part of an efficiency drive, 245 at the RAF bases at Marham in Norfolk and Leeming in North Yorkshire, and 150 in London, Guildford and at other cyber-intelligence sites. There are to be a further 30 job losses at other UK locations. It is the first move in a cost-cutting programme led by BAE\u2019s chief executive, Charles Woodburn, following a lack of orders for the Typhoon jet. Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, vowed to fight what it called a \u201cdevastatingly short-sighted\u201d decision. It had called on the UK government to save jobs prior to BAE\u2019s announcement. The union is considering all options, including industrial action. The Unite assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: \u201cThese planned job cuts will not only undermine Britain\u2019s sovereign defence capability, but devastate communities across the UK who rely on these skilled jobs and the hope of a decent future they give to future generations.\u201d The GMB union told the government to stop dithering and develop a plan to safeguard highly skilled defence jobs. Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer, said: \u201cThe prime minister must step up to the plate and forge trade deals with overseas partner countries, as well as delivering a cast-iron commitment now to build the next-generation fighter planes.\u201d Speaking in parliament, Claire Perry \u2013 minister at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \u2013 insisted that BAE\u2019s changes were \u201cnot related to any UK defence spending decisions\u201d but a result of internal restructuring and normal business practice. She said the government was working with BAE to ensure compulsory redundancies were kept to a minimum, and to secure more orders from abroad. \u201cWe absolutely understand this is a worrying time for those affected.\u201d She said there were opportunities for BAE workers to get jobs in renewable energy with Siemens in Yorkshire. Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, said there was \u201ca very real risk that these skills will be lost forever\u201d. She called on the government to come forward with a \u201cproper industrial strategy\u201d. Woodburn, who became CEO of BAE in July, said the cuts were necessary. \u201cThe organisational changes we are announcing today accelerate our evolution to a more streamlined, de-layered organisation, with a sharper competitive edge and a renewed focus on technology,\u201d he said. \u201cI recognise this will be difficult news for some of our employees and we are committed to do everything we can to support those affected.\u201d BAE is removing management layers in the UK as part of the restructuring, replacing country-based business units (apart from the US) with three divisions \u2013 air, maritime and land \u2013 reporting directly to Woodburn. This means the UK will no longer be a standalone division. Last month Qatar signed a letter of intent to buy 24 Typhoons and six Hawk aircraft from BAE. A potentially large order from Saudi Arabia is still under negotiation. The Typhoon has attracted fewer orders this year than the rival Rafale, built by France\u2019s Dassault Aviation, which has struck deals with Egypt and Qatar. BAE said: \u201cNegotiations are progressing to agree a contract with the government of Qatar, which, if secured, would sustain Typhoon production jobs and manufacturing well into the next decade. \u201cHowever, the timing of future orders is always uncertain and to ensure production continuity and competitive costs between the completion of current contracts and anticipated new orders, we now plan to reduce Typhoon final assembly and Hawk production rates.\u201d The company also blamed the government\u2019s decision to take the RAF Tornado fleet out of service in 2019, which will affect Marham and Leeming, although BAE will continue to work on the F-35 fighter jet at Marham. The Ministry of Defence faces a big budget hole after miscalculating the cost of the Trident nuclear programme and the purchase of F-35s from the US. Unite estimates that by 2020, one-quarter of Britain\u2019s defence spend will be benefiting US companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The union is calling on ministers to commit to long-term projects such as the next-generation fighter jet, future support ships and the Royal Navy\u2019s new Type 31e frigate being designed and built in the UK.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s biggest defence contractor, BAE Systems, is to cut nearly 2,000 jobs in a significant blow to the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector and the government\u2019s industrial strategy.</p> <p>The company, which makes the Eurofighter Typhoon jet and Britain\u2019s nuclear submarines, said on Tuesday that up to 1,400 jobs would go at its military aerospace business over the next three years, along with a further 375 in maritime services and 150 at its cyber-intelligence business. </p> <p>BAE aims to achieve the cuts, which are due to be implemented by 1 January and will affect managers as well as people working on the production line, through voluntary redundancies where possible. It employs 83,100 people worldwide, including 34,600 in the UK.</p> <p>Its aerospace bases at Warton, where parts for the Typhoon are made and assembled, and Samlesbury in Lancashire, which together employ 10,000 people, will see 750 job losses, twice as many as in 2015. Its other aerospace base, in Brough, east Yorkshire, which makes parts for the Hawk, will see its 900-member workforce almost halved to 500, another severe blow to the region after 500 job losses at the site four years ago. </p> <p>A further 340 dockyard job cuts are going in Portsmouth as part of an efficiency drive, 245 at the RAF bases at Marham in Norfolk and Leeming in North Yorkshire, and 150 in London, Guildford and at other cyber-intelligence sites. There are to be a further 30 job losses at other UK locations.</p> <p>It is the first move in a cost-cutting programme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/15/bae-systems-appoints-charles-woodburn-chief-operating-officer-heir-apparent-ian-king\">led by BAE\u2019s chief executive</a>, Charles Woodburn, following a lack of orders for the Typhoon jet.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s largest union, Unite, vowed to fight what it called a \u201cdevastatingly short-sighted\u201d decision. It had called on the UK government to save jobs prior to BAE\u2019s announcement. The union is considering all options, including industrial action.</p> <p>The Unite assistant general secretary, Steve Turner, said: \u201cThese planned job cuts will not only undermine Britain\u2019s sovereign defence capability, but devastate communities across the UK who rely on these skilled jobs and the hope of a decent future they give to future generations.\u201d</p> <p>The GMB union told the government to stop dithering and develop a plan to safeguard highly skilled defence jobs. </p> <p>Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer, said: \u201cThe prime minister must step up to the plate and forge trade deals with overseas partner countries, as well as delivering a cast-iron commitment now to build the next-generation fighter planes.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking in parliament, Claire Perry \u2013 minister at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy \u2013 insisted that BAE\u2019s changes were \u201cnot related to any UK defence spending decisions\u201d but a result of internal restructuring and normal business practice. </p> <p>She said the government was working with BAE to ensure compulsory redundancies were kept to a minimum, and to secure more orders from abroad. \u201cWe absolutely understand this is a worrying time for those affected.\u201d She said there were opportunities for BAE workers to get jobs in renewable energy with Siemens in Yorkshire.</p> <p>Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, said there was \u201ca very real risk that these skills will be lost forever\u201d. She called on the government to come forward with a \u201cproper industrial strategy\u201d.</p> <p>Woodburn, who became CEO of BAE in July, said the cuts were necessary. \u201cThe organisational changes we are announcing today accelerate our evolution to a more streamlined, de-layered organisation, with a sharper competitive edge and a renewed focus on technology,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI recognise this will be difficult news for some of our employees and we are committed to do everything we can to support those affected.\u201d</p> <p>BAE is removing management layers in the UK as part of the restructuring, replacing country-based business units (apart from the US) with three divisions \u2013 air, maritime and land \u2013 reporting directly to Woodburn. This means the UK will no longer be a standalone division.</p> <p>Last month Qatar signed a letter of intent to buy 24 Typhoons and six Hawk aircraft from BAE. A potentially large order from Saudi Arabia is still under negotiation. The Typhoon has attracted fewer orders this year than the rival Rafale, built by France\u2019s Dassault Aviation, which has struck deals with Egypt and Qatar.</p> <p>BAE said: \u201cNegotiations are progressing to agree a contract with the government of Qatar, which, if secured, would sustain Typhoon production jobs and manufacturing well into the next decade.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the timing of future orders is always uncertain and to ensure production continuity and competitive costs between the completion of current contracts and anticipated new orders, we now plan to reduce Typhoon final assembly and Hawk production rates.\u201d</p> <p>The company also blamed the government\u2019s decision to take the RAF <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/04/raf-tornados-strikes-islamic-state-2017-defence\">Tornado fleet out of service</a> in 2019, which will affect Marham and Leeming, although BAE will continue to work on the F-35 fighter jet at Marham.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/31/mod-facing-1bn-a-year-funding-shortfall\">faces a big budget hole</a> after miscalculating the cost of the Trident nuclear programme and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/04/f-35-stealth-jet-fighter-uk-faces-billions-extra-cost\">purchase of F-35s</a> from the US.</p> <p>Unite estimates that by 2020, one-quarter of Britain\u2019s defence spend will be benefiting US companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin.<br></p> <p>The union is calling on ministers to commit to long-term projects such as the next-generation fighter jet, future support ships and the Royal Navy\u2019s new Type 31e frigate being designed and built in the UK.</p>",

    "webTitle": "Deloitte hack hit server containing emails from across US government", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The hack into the accountancy giant Deloitte compromised a server that contained the emails of an estimated 350 clients, including four US government departments, the United Nations and some of the world\u2019s biggest multinationals, the Guardian has been told. Sources with knowledge of the hack say the incident was potentially more widespread than Deloitte has been prepared to acknowledge and that the company cannot be 100% sure what was taken. Deloitte said it believed the hack had only \u201cimpacted\u201d six clients, and that it was confident it knew where the hackers had been. It said it believed the attack on its systems, which began a year ago, was now over. However, sources who have spoken to the Guardian, on condition of anonymity, say the company red-flagged, and has been reviewing, a cache of emails and attachments that may have been compromised from a host of other entities. The Guardian has established that a host of clients had material that was made vulnerable by the hack, including: \u2022 The US departments of state, energy, homeland security and defence. \u2022 The US Postal Service. \u2022 The National Institutes of Health. \u2022 \u201cFannie Mae\u201d and \u201cFreddie Mac\u201d, the housing giants that fund and guarantee mortgages in the US. Football\u2019s world governing body, Fifa, had emails in the server that was breached, along with four global banks, three airlines, two multinational car manufacturers, energy giants and big pharmaceutical companies. The Guardian has been given the names of more than 30 blue-chip businesses whose data was vulnerable to attack, with sources saying the list \u201cis far from exhaustive\u201d. Deloitte did not deny any of these clients had information in the system that was the target of the hack, but it said none of the companies or government departments had been \u201cimpacted\u201d. It said \u201cthe number of email messages targeted by the attacker was a small fraction of those stored on the platform\u201d. This assurance has been contested by sources that spoke to the Guardian. They said Deloitte\u2019s public position belied concern within the company about exactly what had happened and why. The Guardian first revealed the existence of the hack on 25 September. Since then, the Guardian has been provided with further details of the attack, which seems to have started in autumn last year at a time Deloitte was migrating and updating its email from an in-house system to Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based Office 365 service. The work was being undertaken at Deloitte\u2019s Hermitage office in Nashville, Tennessee. The hackers got into the system using an administrator\u2019s account that, theoretically, gave them access to the entire email database, which included Deloitte\u2019s US staff and their correspondence with clients. Deloitte realised it had a substantial problem in spring this year, when it retained the Washington-based law firm, Hogan Lovells, on \u201cspecial assignment\u201d to review and advise about what it called \u201ca possible cybersecurity incident\u201d. In addition to emails, the Guardian understands the hackers had potential access to usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information. It is also thought that some emails had attachments with sensitive security and design details. Deloitte has insisted its internal inquiry, codenamed Windham, found that only six clients had information that had been compromised. The review had also been able to establish \u201cprecisely what information was at risk\u201d, the company said. However, that analysis has been contested by informed sources that have spoken to the Guardian. They say the investigation has not been able to establish definitively when the hackers got in and where they went; nor can they be completely sure that the electronic trail they left is complete. \u201cThe hackers had free rein in the network for a long time and nobody knows the amount of the data taken,\u201d said one source. \u201cA large amount of data was extracted, not the small amount reported. The hacker accessed the entire email database.\u201d Another source added: \u201cThere is an ongoing effort to determine the damage. There is a team looking at records that have been tagged for further analysis. It is all deeply embarrassing.\u201d The Guardian has been told Deloitte did not at the time have multi-factor authentication as standard on the server that was breached. A cybersecurity specialist told the Guardian this was \u201castonishing\u201d. The expert said the migration to the new email system would have \u201cutterly complicated the kind of forensic investigation required to see what had happened\u201d. \u201cA hacker has got into Deloitte\u2019s email system and been undetected for months, and only six clients have been compromised? That does not sound right. If the hackers had been in there that long, they would have covered their tracks.\u201d When the Guardian put all these points to Deloitte, it declined to answer specific questions, but a spokesman said: \u201cWe dispute in the strongest terms that Deloitte is \u2018downplaying\u2019 the breach. We take any attack on our systems very seriously. \u201cWe are confident that we know what information was targeted and what the hacker actually did. Very few clients were impacted, although we want to stress that even when one client is impacted, that is one client too many. \u201cWe have concluded that the attacker is no longer in Deloitte\u2019s systems and haven\u2019t seen any signs of any subsequent activities. \u201cOur review determined what the hacker actually did. The attacker accessed data from an email platform. The review of that platform is complete.\u201d In recent months, Deloitte has introduced multi-factor authentication and encryption software to try to stop further hacks. Dmitri Sirota, co-founder and CEO of the cybersecurity firm BigID, warned that many companies had failed to use such methods because they were inconvenient and complex. \u201cPrivileged accounts are like keys that unlock everything, from the castle to the treasury. They provide unfettered access to all systems, which is why they are so valuable. \u201cOrganisations are monitoring databases, not the data in it. It\u2019s hard to detect changes, prevent incidents or compare your data to notice breached information unless you have an inventory of what you have.\u201d",

Are you a customer, or do you live near one of the so-called \u201cRooboxes\u201d and have you experienced problems? Perhaps you think the service is a good idea? If so, we\u2019d also like to hear from you.<br></p> <h2>Share your experiences</h2> <p>If you have been affected you can get in touch via the form below \u2013 anonymously if you wish.
