      "bodyText": "More than one in four business leaders believe bribery and corruption is rife in the UK, according to survey conducted by accountants EY. Twenty-eight per cent of UK respondents said corruption was widespread \u2013 an increase from 18% a year earlier \u2013 although lower than the 39% average of respondents to the survey conducted in 62 countries. \u201cOur survey finds that more than one in four executives in the UK believe that bribery and corrupt practices happen here, a worryingly high number in a country that prides itself on its strong corporate governance,\u201d said EY\u2019s Jim McCurry. Ninety-eight per cent of UK respondents to its 14th annual global fraud survey also said they recognised the importance of being able to establish the ownership of entities with which they are doing business \u2013 a factor highlighted in the publication of the Panama Papers earlier this month. Overall, 91% of the 3,000 senior executives from 62 countries who took part in the survey supported enhanced beneficial ownership transparency. Last week in Washington, George Osborne and his counterparts from France, Germany, Spain and Italy announced new rules that will lead to the automatic sharing of information about the true owners of complex shell companies and overseas trusts. The chancellor said the enhancing regulations were \u201ca hammer blow against those that would illegally evade taxes and hide their wealth in the dark corners of the financial system\u201d. The survey, conducted before the details of 11.5m files from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca were made public, also found that half of all respondents were prepared to justify unethical behaviour to meet financial targets. This was a greater proportion than the 36% that could justify such behaviour to help a company survive in an economic downturn. The EY report said: \u201cWorryingly, deeper analysis of our survey results identifies that many respondents who are [chief financial officers] and finance team members, individuals with key roles in protecting companies from risks, appear ready to justify unethical conduct. The apparent willingness of these respondents to act unethically when under financial pressure is concerning. Could certain compensation arrangements be encouraging such behaviours?\u201d The survey found that respondents, though, believed that bribery and corruption did not take place in their own sectors. While 39% globally said they believed it happened in their country, only 11% said they thought it was the case in their sector. \u201cBribery and corruption continue to represent a substantial threat to sluggish global growth and fragile financial markets,\u201d the report said. \u201cDespite increased regulatory activity, our research finds that boards could do significantly more to protect both themselves and their companies.\u201d Respondents in the UK also regard cybercrime as a high risk, with 80% of respondents citing it as a concern \u2013 more than elsewhere in the world. \u201cWith the continuing enforcement of anticorruption measures, coupled with recent revelations about the misuse of offshore financial structures, business leaders here need to be focused on securing a deeper understanding of their clients, partners and suppliers. Enhanced transparence is only likely to rise up the political and public agenda, both here and in the rest of the world,\u201d said McCurry. He said EY, which itself has a tax practice, complied with ethical standards. EY conducted 2,825 interviews 62 countries with executives responsible for tackling fraud \u2013 50 of them were in the UK.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Opec struggles to speak with a single voice these days, so it was always a wobbly assumption that the cartel of oil producers would be able to agree a deal with non-members, such as Russia, to curb output. So it has proved. The weekend talks in Doha fell apart over a single issue. Saudi Arabia wanted Iran, its big regional rival, to be included in a deal to freeze production at January levels. Iran, freshly returned to international markets after the lifting of sanctions, wasn\u2019t interested. Its priority is revenues, at almost any oil price, and recovery of lost market share. The first puzzle is why anybody thought that this tension could be resolved. The short answer must be that the Saudi camp gave encouragement for a deal, but then changed its mind. That version tallies with the grumble from the Russian delegation that \u201csome Opec members\u201d put up new demands at the 11th hour. Such an explanation sounds more solid than the idea that the whole two-month adventure was an elaborate ruse to con the market into thinking that the first global oil deal for 15 years was on the way. The bigger unanswered question is what happens next. Monday\u2019s counterintuitive result was: not much. The oil price fell by 4% at the outset, but ended the day virtually flat at $43 a barrel for Brent. Maybe the market thinks that Doha was irrelevant and that demand for oil is slowly catching up with supply, as the producers always said it would. Or maybe a bigger factor was a labour dispute in Kuwait that is affecting output there. As ever with oil prices, it is incredibly hard to decipher short-term price movements. But we can conclude this from the Doha diplomatic debacle: the Saudis are happy to run the risk of the oil price falling back to the $30-a-barrel level seen a couple of months ago. That doesn\u2019t mean such a tumble will materialise \u2013 but it must be more likely than it was. Sorrell should justify his rewards \u201cIf WPP does well, I do well,\u201d says its chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, attempting to get his retaliation in early. The full tally of his rewards for 2015, likely to be around the \u00a370m mark, won\u2019t be formally unveiled until later this month. But the advertising titan is probably correct to detect a row in the offing. If \u00a314m for Bob Dudley was enough to enrage 59% of BP shareholders, a sum five times as large for Sorrell won\u2019t pass under the radar, even if WPP\u2019s share price has performed better. Sorrell\u2019s weekend outburst is unlikely to pacify the sceptics. He\u2019s missed the point of the rebellion at BP, which was about the sheer size of rewards now being paid in big company boardrooms. By contrast, Sorrell\u2019s defence was all about the alignment of his interests with those of WPP. It is true that Sorrell is aligned \u2013 he owns 1.62% of WPP \u2013 but that\u2019s not the subject of the hour. Is \u00a370m a fair take, or does it represent rent extraction? On that point, WPP\u2019s investors made their feelings clear back in 2012, when the company lost the pay vote. As a consequence, it was obliged to drop its controversial incentive plan, known as Leap, or leadership equity acquisition plan. But the concession was hardly dramatic. Leap was allowed to complete its five-year cycle, which is why, coupled with WPP\u2019s strong share price, it is still producing ever larger payouts for Sorrell. If he wants to defend the sum properly, let\u2019s hear less about \u201calignment,\u201d which can used to justify any figure, and more on how any FTSE 100 chief executive could possibly be worth \u00a370m in a single year. When the Powa gets switched off Poor old Dan Wagner. He \u2013 or rather the Powa Technologies business that he founded \u2013 has been hit by a car. Complete accident. Couldn\u2019t see it coming. Nobody to blame, especially not the unfortunate victim. That, at least, was the version of Powa\u2019s collapse into administration that Wagner promoted on BBC Radio 4 at the weekend. It is not persuasive. We can all understand that companies in the business of developing new technology, in this case a system to allow consumers to buy a product by scanning an advert with their smartphones, can rack up overheads before revenues arrive. But the mismatch at Powa, founded in 2007, was extraordinary, as detailed in administrator Deloitte\u2019s report. The company lost \u00a331.8m on revenues of \u00a34.8m in 2015, for example, but was operating from the top floor of a City skyscraper. In those circumstances, it pays to stay close to your financial backers, here meaning Boston investment group Wellington Management, which triggered the administration by calling in loans. If it really came as surprise to Wagner, he should have followed the old road safety advice: stop, look, listen.",

    "webTitle": "Brussels steel summit fails to find answer to oversupply problem", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest steel-producing nations failed to make a breakthrough on the oversupply problem that has thrown the industry into crisis, at a meeting in Brussels. Ministers from 34 countries, representing 93% of global steel production, attended Monday\u2019s talks, on the day the Chinese state news agency said it was \u201clame and lazy\u201d to blame China for the problem. UK Steel, the industry lobby group, criticised the failure to take detailed action, as the future of Britain\u2019s largest steelworks, Port Talbot, hangs in the balance. The US deputy trade representative, Robert Holleyman, said the talks were not an academic issue \u201cbut an exercise dealing with real pain, with real people\u201d. \u201cWe are encouraged by the start of the discussions but we fully believe more most be done and more must be done urgently,\u201d he said. Overproduction of steel is driving plants around the world out of business and has brought the UK industry to the brink of collapse. US and European steel producers have accused China of flooding world markets with heavily subsidised steel that makes it impossible for rivals to compete. But China rejected this argument on Monday, saying the US and European Union were \u201calso plagued by overcapacity to differing degrees\u201d. China\u2019s assistant trade minister, Zhang Ji, told ministers that the economic downturn since 2008 and falling demand was \u201cthe fundamental reason\u201d behind excess capacity. He also highlighted \u201cgeopolitical conflicts, extremism and terrorism\u201d as factors contributing to the problem. Asked about this part of the Chinese speech, the EU trade representative, Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, said: \u201cI don\u2019t really see the link to be honest.\u201d Meanwhile, China\u2019s official state news agency Xinhua said blaming China for global problems in the steel industry was \u201ca lame and lazy excuse for protectionism\u201d. \u201cBlaming other countries is always an easy, sure-fire way for politicians to whip up a storm over domestic economic woes, but finger-pointing and protectionism are counterproductive,\u201d the agency wrote in an English language commentary. Although the remarks are not official policy, they are seen as an indication of the mood among China\u2019s ruling class. But in a tacit acknowledgement that China is producing too much steel, as economic growth rate falters, Beijing promised in February to cut production by 100m-150m tonnes and lay off half a million steelworkers over the next five years. But no further measures were agreed at the one-day talks in Brussels, which included representatives from China, the US, European Union, Germany and the UK. The UK business secretary, Sajid Javid, who was at the meeting, said China had \u201cabsolutely recognised the problem of overcapacity in their country\u201d. He added: \u201cThey\u2019re committing to do something about it and I think that\u2019s a very positive step forward.\u201d Javid, who has been criticised for not doing enough to protect British steel, said the government had \u201cstarted to be approached by interested parties\u201d about buying the loss-making Tata plant at Port Talbot in south Wales, but that it was too early to say much more. \u201cThe important thing is, as we said all along, we will do everything we can to help with that sales process,\u201d he said. Tata Steel, the owners of the loss-making plant, and the British government are searching for a buyer, but chances of a rescue for the entire business are seen as remote, putting at risk 40,000 jobs connected to the plant. Gareth Stace, the director of UK Steel, urged governments to \u201ctake rapid and decisive action\u201d or \u201crisk seeing their steel sectors wither on the vine and die\u201d. He said: \u201cWhat we needed to see at today\u2019s meeting was an agreement by national governments to take short-term, detailed actions to help address the steel sector crisis. However, having agreed what the problems are we appear to be no closer to finding international action to put in place solutions.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A failure by leading oil producers to agree to a freeze on the level of production has led to volatile trading on global markets, with the price of oil slumping more than 5% at one point before recovering in a kneejerk reaction to Opec\u2019s inconclusive meeting. The breakdown of the talks in Doha on Sunday raised questions about the credibility of the oil cartel after Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, demanded that Iran join any agreement to cap production in an effort to the bolster the price. Oil prices, which fell to 11-year lows at the end of last year, rallied 10% last week before the talks, in anticipation that the first global deal in 15 years could be struck between Opec and non-Opec producers to hold output at January\u2019s levels. In initial trading after the deal failed on Monday, Brent crude prices dipped to almost $40 (\u00a328) a barrel, down 7%, before recovering the losses by the end of the London trading day to $43. Norbert Ruecker, the head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer, said: \u201cAlthough this was no official meeting of Opec, the organisation has seen a blow to its perceived powerfulness over the weekend.\u201d He said Saudi Arabia was not helping Opec with its tough stance against Iran, which has been keen to bolster supply following the lifting of sanctions. Oil supply was also cut on Monday as a strike in Kuwait knocked its output by more than half, which helped cushion the market reaction to the failure of the Doha talks. Thomas Pugh, a commodities economist at Capital Economics, said he did not expect Opec\u2019s next meeting on 2 June to achieve agreement either, unless there was some softening in the standoff between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which did not send a representative to Doha. Iran had signalled long before this weekend\u2019s meeting that it would take a tough line on restraining production, given that it wants to continue increasing output to get back to levels seen before international sanctions were imposed. Jasper Lawler, a market analysts at CMC Markets, said the sharp oil price moves on Monday had also fed through to stocks, but that the discord in Doha should not have come as a surprise to investors. \u201cAn agreement always seemed highly doubtful when Iran had said it would not freeze output, having just come out of sanctions and Saudi Arabia said it wouldn\u2019t if Iran didn\u2019t. As soon as Iran shunned the meeting by not sending its oil minister it was an un-done deal,\u201d he said. After the talks, Iran\u2019s oil\u2019s minister, Bijan Zanganeh, continued to insist thathis country could not agree to freeze production levels, while the Iranian Opec governor, Hossein \u200eKazempour Ardebili, called on other producers to continue their negotiations. Pugh said: \u201cThe inability to agree even a face-saving deal has further undermined the credibility of Opec after the group failed to decide on an output quota at its last meeting in December ... The lack of any agreement is also likely to undermine some of the positive sentiment that had been built up in the markets in the previous few weeks.\u201d Even before the meeting, a report by the International Energy Agency had concluded that a mere production freeze would have a only limited effect on physical oil supply. Stock markets, which had also slumped on the back of concern about the oil price, also recovered their losses by the end of the day. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares ended nine points higher at 6,353, having been as low as 6,261. Stock markets across most of continental Europe also ended little changed. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrials Index was also flat as European markets closed.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The technology entrepreneur Dan Wagner, once one of the highest-profile entrepreneurs of the dotcom era, appeared on television on Monday discussing the future of the high street and why it is struggling to survive. Speaking on Sky News, he said: \u201cThere needs to be more of an engagement to drive people out of their homes and into those stores, and make that more compelling.\u201d Wagner did not mention the recent demise of his own retail-linked venture, a business he had hoped would encourage this \u201cengagement\u201d, but instead collapsed into administration in February, having burned through \u00a3147m since 2013. It was only three years ago that the company, Powa Technologies, was praised by David Cameron and hailed as a British \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2013 the term for a technology company yet to join the stock market that is judged to be worth more than $1bn (\u00a3700m). There are only a handful of confirmed British unicorns, among them the flight comparison website Skyscanner, money transfer service TransferWise and music discovery app Shazam, but every startup wants to be one and every investor wants to find one. However, Powa\u2019s collapse shows how quickly a unicorn can go from valuable to valueless if it trips up on the way to the promised land. Founded by the flamboyant Wagner in 2007, Powa was developing a product called PowaTag, which would allow consumers to scan an item or advert with their smartphone and see details or buy the product immediately. It was billed as the Shazam of shopping; Powa also built retail websites and made tills and card-reading technology. Wagner said in 2014 that Powa was worth $2.7bn and the company claimed that 1,200 businesses had signed up for PowaTag, although it was later reported that many of these were non-binding letters of intent. But it all came crashing down two months ago, when US-based investment group Wellington Management, which had put up \u00a3137m in loans and equity starting in 2013 and was Powa\u2019s biggest investor, called in \u00a342m of loans that were due for repayment in December. Wagner, whose previous best-known business, Dialog, lost 95% of its value during the dotcom boom and bust, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s In Business on Sunday that Powa\u2019s fall into administration had come as a complete shock. \u201cThey [Wellington] didn\u2019t tell us or the board. Just one day the administrators turned up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the business equivalent of walking across the street and being hit by a car. It is one of those things which sometimes happens which is completely random. It doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect on what we were building, it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect on the capability or the experience or the management capacity to deliver value. It doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect whether or not the valuation was right or wrong. Certainly, in this case, I can tell you it was just one of those extraordinary things that should never have happened.\u201d However, a report from administrators Deloitte into the collapse paints a picture of a business running out of control. According to the report, Powa, which had not filed accounts since 2013, had \u00a3277,000 in cash in the bank when it went into administration; the report shows that money had been pouring out of the business at the same time as it was struggling to build revenues. Powa made a loss of \u00a316.6m in 2013 on revenues of \u00a3667,000. The next year, it lost \u00a338.5m on revenues of just over \u00a31m, and in 2015, it lost \u00a331.8m on revenues of \u00a34.8m. Most of the revenues came from its point of sale and web businesses rather than PowaTag. Staff costs came to \u00a36.8m in 2013, \u00a325m the following year and \u00a324.8m in 2015. Some of that went to contractors, but last year about \u00a315m was shared between 168 Powa employees \u2013 an average of nearly \u00a390,000 a head. It was extravagant in other ways. The company was based in the top two floors of Heron Tower, the tallest skyscraper in the City of London, but the prestigious setting \u2013 an unlikely one for a startup \u2013 came at a cost of nearly \u00a36m over three years, according to Deloitte. It also had offices in Hong Kong, Australia and Europe, and employed 300 people worldwide in an ambitious attempt to expand across the globe. Indeed, Powa had been pinning its hopes on a major deal in China, a joint venture for PowaTag hailed by Wagner as having limitless potential, which would generate \u00a33.5bn over three years. But this potential was never realised. Deloitte said: \u201cPowaTag required modification for the Chinese market and significant work was undertaken to try to meet the delivery date in January 2016, which never happened.\u201d The company is now facing claims from 110 former staff related to unpaid wages of \u00a3150,000, and claims from trade creditors worth nearly \u00a315m, but the Deloitte report indicates that they are unlikely to see any of the money. Wellington, however, has received some of its investment back. The PowaTag business and technology has been sold at a notional cost of \u00a342m to a new company jointly owned by Wellington and Ben White, who joined Powa as a director in January to raise funds for the business. And Wagner himself has taken part in the administrator\u2019s fire sale. He paid \u00a31,155 for \u201ccertain items of boardroom equipment and furniture\u201d from Powa. Perhaps he is getting ready for his next venture.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A financial trading firm\u2019s plan to make millions by building a mast higher than the Shard in rural Kent has suffered a setback after its proposals were challenged by Dover council. Vigilant Global is one of two companies hoping to build a communications mast designed to boost profits by shaving milliseconds off the time it takes to beam information to European markets. But the council questioned the tactics used by the firm in the planning process and cast doubt on whether local people would see the benefits that Vigilant says they will. In a 20-page document, council officials said Vigilant had provided \u201conly scant detail of the purpose of the mast\u201d, instead choosing to focus on the potential benefits to the local community. \u201cOf primary concern is the lack of detail of the main function and purpose of the mast,\u201d the council said, adding that the plan \u201cappeared to relate to improvements in the financial field\u201d. Planning officials also questioned Vigilant\u2019s \u201cinteresting\u201d choice of location used to assess the impact the mast would have on views near the medieval town of Sandwich. Vigilant chose a viewpoint looking out across a boatyard on the river Stour, an angle the council said would make it \u201cdifficult to distinguish where the mast would appear in the view\u201d because it would be disguised by dozens of boat masts. The council said there had been no assessment of the impact that lights attached to the mast, for the purposes of warning low-flying aircraft, would have on the night sky. Officials raised further concerns about archaeological remains in the area, near the site of the Romans\u2019 first landfall in Britain, saying the effects on these were \u201cnot well considered\u201d. The document also revealed that Vigilant was considering using helicopters to ferry equipment to the proposed site of its mast. Eric Bellerive, the director of global networks at Vigilant Global, said it was common practice for additional information to be requested on such large planning applications. \u201cThe original archaeological submission was based on a previous application for the same site, which was considered suitable by the council though we are happy to provide additional information,\u201d he said, adding that the company was working with the local community to finalise the benefits. Vigilant has sought to win over locals by promising that the mast will help boost broadband speeds and mobile phone coverage. But the council said it was \u201cdifficult to establish the proposed benefit that the mast would afford in terms of broadband coverage\u201d. The council called on Vigilant to provide new evidence to address its concerns, a process that could benefit similar plans for a mast put forward by a rival company, New Line Networks (NLN), which has not got as far as Vigilant in the planning process. NLN recently filed an objection to Vigilant\u2019s plans in an apparent attempt to slow its rival\u2019s progress, although both companies have said they would consider sharing just one mast. Both firms say the site, near Richborough in Kent, has a direct line of sight to another mast in Belgium, allowing for microwave signals to be beamed across the Channel in a fraction of a second. The battle illustrates the lengths to which high-frequency traders are willing to go to secure a couple of milliseconds advantage over rivals. The focus on speed earned the industry the nickname \u201cflash boys\u201d, after the Michael Lewis book of the same name. It details how a company called Spread Networks dug an 827-mile trench under mountains and across rivers from Chicago to New Jersey \u2013 at a cost of $300m.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets recovered from an early slide in the wake of the weekend\u2019s failure by oil producers to agree an output cut, when Saudi Arabia insisted Iran should take part but the latter refusing, writes Nick Fletcher. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: Oil producers failed to reach a consensus over limiting production at yesterday\u2019s key meeting in Doha, leaving equities to start the week under something of a shadow, but the downside pressures are certainly looking to be remarkably short-lived. The FTSE 100 and crude oil alike have pared earlier losses, something that could be seen as underlying just where the problem now lies regarding over supply of crude. Yes, Saudi Arabia may be threatening to ramp up output, but with demand stagnant and storage facilities running close to capacity, the argument is looking slightly academic. On top of this we have Opec set to reconvene in two months time, by which time Iran will have made some progress in terms of accelerating its production. This debate still has some distance to run and equity markets are applauding the fact it\u2019s far from over. An oil workers strike in Kuwait which cut the country\u2019s output in half also gave some support to the crude price. So Brent is currently down just 0.3% at $42.94 a barrel having earlier fallen as low as $40.1. On the European markets, the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished up just 0.15% or 9.77 points at 6353.52, recovering from a low of 6261 Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.68% to 10,120.31 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.26% to 4506.84 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB rose 0.55% to 18,358.25 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.35% at 8881.6 But in Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.06% to 574.37 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 72 points or 0.41% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Wall Street has opened lower, as Doha disappointment reaches New York. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 43 points, or 0.25%, in early trading, with the falling oil price hitting energy firms. Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has met with EC vice-president Jyrki Katainen today, as efforts to break the deadlock between Greece and its lenders continue. Tsipras\u2019s office say that the PM told Katainen that the emphasis now should be on growth, investment and employment, rather than finding additional spending cuts. Katainen has tweeted that the talks were productive: Officials representing Greece\u2019s lenders are arriving back in Athens today, for fresh talks. It\u2019s possible (although frankly not very likely) that the review of Greece\u2019s reform measures could be concluded before Friday, when eurozone finance ministers hold a regular meeting. An EC spokesman told a news conference in Brussels that: The aim of the mission remains to conclude the first review of the programme as soon as possible.\u201d The central bank of Brazil appears to have intervened to weaken the real, after seeing it jump by 1.5% against the US dollar in early trading. Oil is coming under more pressure at American investors reach their desks, pushing US and Brent crude down around 4%. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga says there\u2019s an \u201cundeniable feeling of disappointed\u201d in the global markets. Despite Iran\u2019s absence in the meeting, expectations were high for a freeze deal to be struck, but the visible dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran sabotaged all efforts consequently causing WTI crude to plunge more than 5%. While realistically the effects of an output freeze would have had a minimal impact on the supply glut, even a symbolic gesture from OPEC to deal with the oversupply could have boosted optimism for future deals. Brazil\u2019s currency has surged at the start of the American trading day, following last night\u2019s congressional vote to impeach president Dilma Rousseff. Investors are calculating that if Rousseff is ousted, a new government could promote more growth-friendly measures and overhaul tax and spending policies. But Mihir Kapadia, CEO at Sun Global Investments, warns that the markets may have got too excited, given Brazil\u2019s economic problems. The issue now moves to the Senate as the drawn-out process continues its March towards what looks like an inevitable conclusion. Brazilian stocks are now up 23% in 2016 \u2013 that\u2019s 43% up in US dollar terms - and this latest development is likely to add even more momentum to bonds, equity and the Brazilian Real. In all likelihood we will see some profit-taking soon, as the market will start to focus on a post-Rousseff world where the economy must struggle through a deep and long recession. Back in London, Centrica appears to have avoided a major shareholder vote over pay. The parent company of British Gas has been criticised for handing its new boss, Iain Conn, a \u00a33m deal, at a time when it\u2019s also cutting 3,000 workers. But only 15% of shareholders have voted against the package, according to figures released at its annual general meeting today: Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, has also insisted that his country won\u2019t join an output freeze. Zanganeh argues that Iran can hardly impose sanctions on itself, having only just shaken off international restrictions. Newsflash from Dubai: Iran has called for other oil producers to continue negotiating an output freeze. Iranian OPEC Governor Hossein \u200eKazempour Ardebilli has told local media that production curbs are needed, but insisted that Iran won\u2019t take part. Reuters has the details: \u201cWe support cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC member countries and efforts to bring stability to the oil market, and we urge all producers to continue their negotiations,\u201d Ardebilli said. But he also said Iran had made it clear that it wanted to regain its share of the oil market lost when it was hit by economic sanctions, and that \u201cits position is supported by most OPEC and non-OPEC members around the world\u201d. Bloomberg have just published an inside account of how the OPEC talks floundered yesterday. It confirms that initial optimism waned once Saudi Arabia surprised attendees by insisting that any deal had to include Iran. And with Iran stayed away from Doha, because they were unwilling to accept an output freeze, there was little chance of agreement. Here\u2019s a flavour: In an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia, Russia\u2019s Novak said at a press conference after the talks that some countries changed their position right before the meeting after agreeing to an earlier draft. \u201cI thought countries that came here, came to agree and not to discuss the need of joining in of those countries that were not participating,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had been disputing today a lot, and that was because some countries from OPEC changed their positions in the morning.\u201d Get your thinking caps on - The Treasury\u2019s new analysis into the risks of Brexit has just been published. Politics Live has full details of the report, and George Osborne\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A which is happening now. The initial panic over the failure of the Doha talks may be easing, as oil recovers some of its early losses. Brent crude is now trading around $42, down around 2.5% from Friday night. Still a chunky loss, but better than the initial 5% tumble. Investors may be concluding that OPEC\u2019s deadlock hasn\u2019t really changed anything, especially as Saudi Arabia and Iran were always unlikely to emerge as best friends. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets , explains: Traders appear to be coming round to the understanding that although no deal came out of the weekend\u2019s Doha oil production freeze meeting, we shouldn\u2019t really have expected anything given the strong stances by Iran (\u2018not while we ramp up post sanctions\u2019) and Saudi Arabia (not without Iran). George Osborne\u2019s report on the benefits of the EU is already making my head hurt. UK chancellor George Osborne is about to give a speech on why Britain should stay within the European Union. He\u2019s announcing an official Treasury report which found that households would be thousands of pounds worse off if Britain leaves the EU, as growth will be slower over the Although journalists were briefed about the report yesterday, it\u2019s only being released this morning. Some Brexit campaigners are already questioning whether the findings are truly accurate, given the government\u2019s strong support for the Remain campaign. Our Politics Live blog is covering Osborne\u2019s speech: Investors in Moscow have reacted badly to the lack of an oil deal. The ruble has slumped by over 1% against the US dollar, to 67.3 from 66.4 on Friday night. The Russian stock market is also suffering, down almost 3% right now. Russia is the world\u2019s largest oil producer, and its 2016 budget was based on an average oil price of $50 per barrel. Readers who can remember the oil price shocks of the 1970s may welcome OPEC\u2019s recent impotence over the price of crude. In an era where market abuse is outlawed and anti-competitive businesses face hefty fines, the oil cartel feels as outdated as flares and jumpsuits. And there is something rather sinister about oil producers gathering, amid a media scrum, to cobble a deal to boost their revenues at the expense of the rest of the world. So many developed economies will welcome the sight of oil falling back towards $40 per barrel, as Mike Bird of the WSJ points out: However.... another bout of oil price volatility might do more harm than good. Oil producers are already suffering fiscal pain, given crude is trading well below their break-even point. The IMF recently predicted that Saudi Arabia would be forced into deep austerity, with tax hikes and spending cuts, unless crude prices recover. Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen warned last month that oil could be near a \u201cfinancial tipping point\u201d. If OPEC members slash spending, and oil producers lay off staff, the wider global economy could suffer. Saudi Arabia and Iran have been fighting a proxy war in Yemen for months, so it\u2019s hardly surprising that they can\u2019t get on the same page over oil. In addition, it was clearly implausible that Iranian officials would commit to freezing output at January levels, the point in which sanctions had just been lifted. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, says: Both sides had made their stances clear, although Saudi Arabia clearly thought Tehran might come to the table at the 11th hour. The prospect of cheaper oil is pushing up shares in airlines and holiday firms; every other sector is down, though. European stock markets are falling sharply at the start of trading, following oil\u2019s lead In London, the FTSE 100 has lost 50 points, or 0.7%, to 6299 as a bout of Doha disappointment grips the City. Royal Dutch Shell and BP both lost over 2%, while emerging market-focused bank Standard Chartered is the biggest faller, down 4%. Mining companies are also down, reflecting concerns that emerging market growth will suffer if the oil price remains low. Other European markets have dropped by around 1%: Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, explains how investors had pinned such hopes on OPEC\u2019s meeting. The market had high expectations that an agreement would be forged in Doha yesterday to limit oil production. This failed to materialise and the rally we had observed for crude prices \u2013 which in turn was lending support to the broader equity market \u2013 is now quickly coming undone. Colin Smith, oil and gas analyst at City stockbroker Panmure Gordon, predicts more volatility in the crude price, now that OPEC has shown it cannot agree an output freeze. He adds: Given that this meeting has been three months in the making, it is surprising that it was held at all in the absence of firm commitments to strike a deal and odder still that the position of the most important player, Saudi Arabia, had not been fully firmed up in advance. Iran had always excluded itself from participation in a deal and it was not present at the Doha meeting. The finger pointing suggests that Saudi Arabia could not bring itself to sign a deal without some sort of commitment from Iran and may have been expecting late concessions. This is oil\u2019s biggest one-day plunge since February. Several oil producers are venting their anger about the Doha failure. Falah Alamri, Iraq\u2019s representative, says (via the FT). \u201cWe are very very disappointed.....This will affect the [oil] price and our earnings. We wanted a deal.\u201d Oman\u2019s oil minister, Mohammed Al Rumhy, is also disapppointed: Analysts are largely blaming Saudi Arabia for OPEC\u2019s failure to agree an output freeze. Ed Morse, head of global commodity research at Citigroup, told Bloomberg that: \u201cThe weekend talks are demonstration that the Saudi government, as the deputy crown prince has clearly stated, doesn\u2019t want to cede market share. They are fearful that the world may be in a weak or bearish market for a long period of time. In a bear market, as they learned from the 1980s, if they cede market share it is very difficult to get it back.\u201d The price of oil is sliding sharply this morning, as markets are hit by gloom following yesterday\u2019s OPEC meeting. US crude oil has shed almost 5%, falling to $38.45 per barrel. Brent crude is suffering too, down 4.4% at $41.20. Oil has now lost all its recent gains, as hopes of a breakthrough deal between producers are dashed. Investors are unhappy that the proposed deal to freeze oil output at January\u2019s levels fell apart last night. The talks failed because Saudi Arabia insisted that Iran joined in with the deal - even though Iranian ministers has already warned they wouldn\u2019t take part (and didn\u2019t even show up in Doha). The feuding between the two countries appears to have ruined any chance of a deal between OPEC members, and Russia. That has reignited speculation of a new battle for market share; good news for oil consumers, but potentially damaging to oil producers. Oil and shares have been tracking each other closely for many months, so the Doha fiasco may cause wider losses today.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors have a lot to worry about this week. Firstly, OPEC has just failed to agree a deal to freeze crude output, at their crunch meeting on Sunday. That\u2019s obviously bad for the oil price, and may also prompt a rout in the currencies of commodity currencies. Then there\u2019s Brazil. Overnight, MPs have dramatically voted to impeach Dilma Rousseff, over allegations that her government illegally used money from state-owned banks to cover up the budget deficit. The vote, amid dramatic scenes inside and outside congress, put the Brazilian president in a very sticky situation. Brazilian assets have already been rising, as investors anticipate Rousseff being toppled, and replaced by a more free-market friendly leader. But with her supporters angrily crying \u201ccoup, coup, coup\u201d last night, the future of the recession-dogged country is unclear. Brazil\u2019s woes come at a tough time for the world economy, which appears to be running out of gas again. IMF chief Christine Lagarde will be taking questions on Twitter tonight, from 6pm BST (1pm in Washington). Britain\u2019s EU referendum continues to loom over the markets. Today, the Treasury will be pitching into the war of words, and tit-for-tat statistics, with a report claiming that families will be thousands of pounds worse off after Brexit. Over in Brussels, ministers from across the globe will gather for an emergency summit on the crisis gripping the steel industry - putting thousands of jobs at risk at plants across the UK. And Greece\u2019s lenders are due to resume bailout negotiations with government officials in Athens. There\u2019s no sign that a deal is close, though. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....",

Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, said the number of domestic accounts fell by 224,000 to 14.44m between the end of December and the end of March. British Gas lost 119,000 accounts last year. The company said the decline was due to a large number of customers coming off fixed-rate tariffs at the same time. Iain Conn, Centrica\u2019s chief executive, said 88% of customers eligible to switch had decided to stay with British Gas. Speaking after Centrica\u2019s annual general meeting in London, he said: \u201cIf a lot of people take them up, then a lot end at the same time.\u201d The company\u2019s board faced questions about pay, the treatment of customers, and climate change at the meeting in London. Centrica\u2019s was the first big shareholder meeting since heavy defeats for BP and Smith &amp; Nephew last week marked a fiery start to the 2016 AGM season. Centrica\u2019s chairman, Rick Haythornthwaite, told the meeting that 85% of investors had approved the company\u2019s remuneration report. At last year\u2019s AGM, only 67% of investors voted in favour after concerns were raised about the pay deal for Conn, who was hired from BP. Centrica paid Conn \u00a33m for his first year in the role, during which underlying profit fell and he announced 6,000 job cuts by 2020. In a trading update, Centrica said half those cuts would come this year and that 800 people had left in the first three months of 2016. John Farmer, a regular critic of UK boards at AGMs, said Conn was overpaid and that Centrica\u2019s strategy was muddled. He compared Conn to Marc Bolland, the departed chief executive of Marks &amp; Spencer, arguing that Conn\u2019s experience in the oil industry was not the right fit for Centrica. Bolland, a food retailer, failed to fix M&amp;S\u2019s clothing business when he was in charge. Haythornthwaite said the comfortable vote for the pay report indicated that shareholders largely approved of the deal the company struck to recruit Conn. He added that Conn was the right person for the job and that the way he conducted himself in trying to overhaul Centrica was a cause for celebration. However, the GMB union said British Gas workers were demoralised by Conn\u2019s job cuts and that the business was under strain. \u201cStaff are confused and disillusioned, managers don\u2019t know if they\u2019re staying or going and the only word from the top is cut, cut, cut,\u201d said Brian Strutton, GMB\u2019s national secretary. When Conn\u2019s pay was revealed last month, fuel poverty campaigners noted that the company was among those criticised by the Competition and Markets Authority for overcharging customers. Centrica appeared happy to discuss the number of customer departures as evidence that there is a competitive energy market in the UK. Fuel poverty campaigners at the meeting accused it of heavy-handed methods in imposing prepaid gas meters on customers and asked the Centrica board to link bosses\u2019 pay to winter deaths from fuel poverty. Conn said it would be better for British Gas customers if Britain voted to stay in the EU at the referendum on 23 June. He said the UK would rely on imports for more of its energy in future and that it was better for the country to be at the table in Europe when prices were set. Bruce Duguid from Hermes Equity Ownership Services asked the board to set carbon reduction targets for its customers as well as for its own output, because 90% of emissions associated with Centrica occur with customers. Haythornthwaite said it was a good idea, but the time was not right yet. Centrica said it was on track to make \u00a3750m in cost savings by 2020 and that its UK business returned to profit in the first quarter of 2016.",

Testifying at the trial of five former Barclays employees accused of conspiring to manipulate Libor, the former British Bankers\u2019 Association (BBA) director John Ewan said he had not been concerned that banks were trying to influence the rate. The Serious Fraud Office has charged Jonathan Mathew, a former Barclays rate submitter, and his former colleagues at the bank \u2013 derivatives traders Stylianos Contogoulas, Jay Merchant, Alex Pabon and Ryan Reich \u2013 each with one count of conspiracy to defraud by manipulating US dollar Libor rates between June 2005 and September 2007. The five men have pleaded not guilty. Ewan was asked about a meeting with senior Barclays employee Miles Storey at which the banker told him that it would \u201cnot be feasible\u201d for banks to conspire to change the Libor rate. According to minutes taken at the meeting, and submitted as evidence to the trial at Southwark crown court, this was partly a reaction to \u201crumblings\u201d from other banks about the Libor rates that Barclays was submitting to the BBA. Ewan said: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to un-know what we now know. But at the time I didn\u2019t think about it very much and I took it at face value when Barclays told me it wouldn\u2019t be possible for them to get together and try to manipulate Libor rates.\u201d Asked whether he had received complaints from banks that they believed that rivals were submitting false Libor rates in order to make money, Ewan said: \u201cI really don\u2019t remember.\u201d The BBA oversaw Libor, a key financial benchmark underpinning contracts worth trillions of pounds worldwide, from the mid-1980s until it was stripped of responsibility for setting the rate in 2013. During the financial crisis, Ewan was in charge of producing a report on reforming Libor following allegations of abuse. The jurors were told by the prosecution earlier in the trial that the defendants conspired to manipulate the Libor rate for US dollars. The court heard that the group were paid big bonuses and offered each other wine and coffee in return for favourable rates. However, defence lawyers for the accused have told the court that they only did what they were told to by their Barclays bosses, without realising it was wrong, and that they did not benefit financially.

The Indian-based business announced that Bimlendra Jha, already an executive committee member of Tata Steel Europe, had been appointed chief executive of Tata Steel UK and would oversee the sale of the remaining business. Jha had \u201csuccessfully led the divestment process that resulted in the signing of a sale and purchase agreement with Greybull Capital on 11 April\u201d, the company said. The investment firm is buying Tata\u2019s long products business in a move that will revive the British Steel brand and could save up to 4,400 jobs. Greybull is keeping the steelworks in Scunthorpe open, along with two mills in Teesside, an engineering workshop in Workington, a design consultancy in York and a mill in northern France. The deal did not include the Port Talbot steelworks or the rest of Tata\u2019s UK business, which employs about 15,000 people and which is up for sale. More than 190 potential financial and industrial investors have been approached about the business, Tata said as it confirmed that Standard Chartered had been appointed as advisers alongside KPMG. Koushik Chatterjee, Tata Steel\u2019s group executive director, said: \u201cBimlendra\u2019s successful experience of the process of divestment of \u2018long products Europe\u2019 will be invaluable as Tata Steel Europe explores strategic alternatives for its operations in the UK. \u201cTo deliver greater clarity for all key stakeholders such as employees, customers and suppliers, it is important for the new team to seek all credible options in a time-bound manner.\u201d Jha\u2019s appointment was announced as Sajid Javid, the business secretary, attended talks in Brussels to try to find answers to the global steel glut. He is meeting officials from China, which is blamed for dumping steel on the market, India and 27 other nations. Before the summit, Javid told MPs: \u201cMy colleagues and I have already been in contact with potential buyers making it clear that the government stands ready to help ... Commercial confidentiality means I cannot go into detail about ongoing discussions.\u201d He set out how much the government had paid in compensation for energy schemes such as feed-in tariffs for generating power. \u201cWe have so far paid over \u00a323m to 12 companies, including Tata,\u201d Javid said. \u201cWe are continuing to rapidly work through applications and will be making further payments over the coming weeks.

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca has slipped back following weekend reports it was considering a \u00a37bn bid for San Francisco cancer treatment specialist Medivation. The US company has already rejected an approach from France\u2019s Sanofi, and is said to have hired advisers to help fend off any hostile move. Analysts believe there is likely to be interest from other pharmaceutical businesses, with AstraZeneca just one possible bidder. Shore Capital\u2019s Dr Tara Raveendran said: A bid for the company would fit with AstraZeneca\u2019s recent strategic focus on oncology, with durvalumab, Lynparza and Tagrisso expected to collectively earn $12bn per annum in sales by 2023F a significant proportion of the $45bn target set by chief executive Pascal Soriot following the Pfizer-bid. Alongside combinations of in-house drugs, Astrazeneca have also looked to acquisitions in order to acquire new oncology therapies, including the $4bn acquisition for a 55% stake in Acerta Pharma and their blood cancer candidate acalabrutinib. Medivation markets prostate cancer drug Xtandi in the US, which has come under scrutiny from US politicians who want to see a price reduction, but also has pipeline assets such as the P3 PARP-inhibitor talazoparib in development for patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with BRCA 1/2 mutation. Whether Astrazeneca will actually make a bid remains unclear. Some have suggested that the company is unlikely to enter a bidding war, which could be significant given the interest of Sanofi and reported interest from other companies such as Roche. Additionally, 2015 full year results showed the dilutive impact of recent transactions with Mr Soriot stating that further large deals would only occur if they could immediately boost earnings. However, with growth platform Brilinta recently missing its primary endpoint in the Socrates study, there may be pressure on Mr Soriot to deliver a share price reflective of Pfizer\u2019s takeover offer two years ago and we would not rule out a bid at this stage. Astra is currently down 3p at 4143.5p.",

      "bodyText": "In the wake of the weekend\u2019s meeting of oil producers which broke up without agreement on an output freeze, commoditiy companies are helping drag the stock market lower. Technology firms are also under pressure after reports that Apple plans to reduce production of iPhones in the April to June quarter after sluggish sales. So chip designer Arm is down 27.5p at 962.5p ahead of a trading update this week, while smaller peer Imagination Technologies is 6.5p lower at 171.75p. Another Apple supplier, Laird, has slipped 2.9p to 374.5p. Liberum analysts said: The Nikkei is reporting that Apple has extended production cuts into the June quarter. Negative read across for Laird (around 17% Apple), Imagination (around 50% apple) and Arm (around 10% Apple). Arm has also been unsettled by a downgrade from Jefferies, which has moved from buy to hold and cut its price target from \u00a311.40 to 923p. The broker said: Arm has been the darling of UK tech, but its story is changing. The Mobile tailwind is less assured, while new areas (Networking/Servers) are more competitive and fragmented. We model earnings per share more than doubling by 2020, but strongly believe the multiple the market has on that growth is too high. Into the first quarter 2016 print, we seek more comfort on i) smartphone chip pricing and ii) increases in accrued revenue. Overall the FTSE 100 has fallen 31.05 points to 6312.70, having earlier dropped as low as 6261. After the oil producers failed to agree a freeze, Brent crude is down 4.45% at $41.18 a barrel. So Royal Dutch Shell A shares have slipped 48p to \u00a317.66, while BP is 7.8p lower at 348.15p. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, said: The prospect of Opec and other big oil producers freezing output... helped lift crude from its January nadir, but in the end it\u2019s proved just too much for the Saudis to cut a deal with Iran. This was not a surprise \u2013 both sides had made their stances clear, although Saudi Arabia clearly thought Tehran might come to the table at the 11th hour. The short-term impact on prices is clear to see this morning, while longer term it\u2019s hard to see supply slowing much this year. Arguably the biggest effect of this meeting is showing that Opec wields a little less power to control prices than it has in the past. The cartel is not what it used to be. Mining shares have also fallen, with Antofagasta down 13.5p at 457.5p while Glencore has dropped 3.75p to 151.90p. Elsewhere Centrica has lost 6.6p to 231.7p as the British Gas owner reported it had lost another 1.5% of its home energy customers in the first quarter. But holiday group Tui has climbed 31p to \u00a310.72 as Berenberg moved from hold to buy and lifted its target price from \u00a312.75 to \u00a313. The bank said: We retain a cautious view about the tour operators industry and still believe that it will need to continue to extract efficiencies to stay competitive with the associated one-off restructuring costs. However, following the escalation in geo-political risks recently, we feel that the underperformance is overdone as we still expect the European consumer to go on holiday. In our view, TUI continues to deliver a superior performance within its tour operation business. This is reflected in a stronger top-line evolution and also it has had a superior cash generation for shareholders. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the TUI tour operation business is trading at a material discount to Thomas Cook if we put its Hotels and Cruises businesses on appropriate multiples. Finally, there appears to be strong interest in the Hotelbeds business, which we believe could lead to a sale price that is well received by the market. Travel companies have also been lifted by the drop in the oil price, on the basis it could feed through into lower fuel costs. EasyJet is up 30p at \u00a314.77 while British Airways owner International Airlines Group has added 9p to 543p. EasyJet was also the subject of weekend reports it was considering a bid for Monarch Airlines. Housebuilders have recovered some ground after last week\u2019s losses on concerns about the outlook, given Brexit worries and signs of falling prices. Berkeley Group is 46p better at \u00a329.08 and Taylor Wimpey has risen 2.4p to 175.1p. Sainsbury has slipped 1.1p to 283.8p following a report from Sky that a consortium of CVC, Qatar\u2019s QIA and Canada\u2019s Brookfield has abandoned a planned takeover after the supermarket group launched a \u00a31.4bn bid of its own for Argos-owner Home Retail Group.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Lawyers have endorsed the construction union\u2019s controversial claims that building workers would have fewer rights than ice dealers under new legislation. But the government has criticised the claims, calling them a stunt because the building regulator has similar compulsory examination powers. On Sunday the Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union (CFMEU) launched an ad dramatising the fact the Australian building and construction commission (ABCC) bill extends the building regulator\u2019s compulsory examination powers. In the ad, a stern male figure who remains in shadows tells a soft-faced middle-aged construction worker: \u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to remain silent, and you don\u2019t have the right to a lawyer of your choice.\u201d A bearded man labelled an ice dealer is told: \u201cYou have the right to remain silent, and you have the right to a lawyer of your choice.\u201d It concludes: \u201cIf Malcolm Turnbull gets his way, a worker will have [fewer] rights than an ice dealer.\u201d The CFMEU\u2019s construction national secretary, Dave Noonan, said: \u201cThere are basic principles of law and common rights that we\u2019re entitled to as Australian citizens.\u201d Under the ABCC bill it is an offence punishable by up to six months\u2019 prison not to comply with an order to give evidence. Claims the evidence would incriminate the witness are no excuse not to provide it. However, evidence given cannot be used in proceedings against the witness. An industrial lawyer and Maurice Blackburn principal, Kamal Farouque, told Guardian Australia the ABCC could compulsorily examine witnesses who had no privilege against self-incrimination. \u201cThis is different to the ordinary criminal situation where people suspected of a crime don\u2019t have to speak to police,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ad is accurate in that respect, definitely.\u201d A criminal lawyer and Stary Norton Halphen principal, Robert Stary, said: \u201cIt\u2019s true that everyone charged with a conventional criminal offence has many more rights than a building worker in an industrial dispute. \u201cThe right against self-incrimination and the right to silence are cornerstones of our justice system.\u201d The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, told the Senate the CFMEU\u2019s ads were based on a false premise and were a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d because the union had not complained when the current regulator, Fair Work Building and Construction (FWBC), was given compulsory examination powers. \u201cThe ABCC will have the same powers as former prime minister [Julia] Gillard gave to the [FWBC], the same powers that this Senate itself voted to extend until 30th June 2017,\u201d she said. \u201cThey will do anything and they will say anything to ensure that the laws in the building and construction industry are not changed.\u201d The ABCC\u2019s compulsory powers are similar to those of FWBC, although it needs an administrative tribunal member to approve orders to force evidence. Australian Industry Group head of workplace relations policy, Stephen Smith, said the comparison between ice dealers and construction workers was \u201cnot a comparison that can be validly be made\u201d. \u201cThe best comparison is with other [civil] regulators, like the Australian Securities and Investments Commission [Asic], the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the Australian Tax Office,\u201d he said. \u201c[Compulsory examination powers] are not exceptional when you look at those other regulators. They need to investigate breaches and if witnesses refuse to talk, they\u2019re hampered in that effort.\u201d The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry\u2019s workplace relations director, Richard Calver, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t compare an ABCC investigation with a criminal investigation where a suspect risks life imprisonment if convicted. \u201cRights are context specific. A person in the building industry risks nothing by cooperating with the ABCC, because the answers they give can\u2019t be used against them unless they fail [to cooperate] or lie.\u201d Workers are allowed a lawyer of their choice, but the ABCC bill states only that a person \u201cmay be represented by a lawyer if the person chooses\u201d. An employment department spokeswoman said: \u201cThe ABCC legislation expressly says that witnesses can be represented by a lawyer. \u201cRegulators such as the ABCC, Asic and ACCC who have compulsory examination powers have the ability to exclude a particular lawyer to preserve the integrity of an investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, it may be appropriate for different lawyers to represent witnesses who contradict each other, or to have different lawyers represent a witness to wrongdoing and the person suspected of breaking the law.\u201d Farouque said the provisions were concerning because the ABCC could take an expansive view of its powers and exclude particular practitioners from representing construction industry witnesses. On Monday independent senator Jacqui Lambie said she would oppose the ABCC bill in the Senate, citing a lack of oversight for the coercive powers and the ability for the ABCC to exclude a particular lawyer from an examination. The trade union royal commission recommended the building regulator has compulsory investigatory and information gathering powers equivalent to those possessed by other civil regulators. It said the ABCC bill powers \u201cappear appropriate in this regard\u201d. Calver said a report on the ABCC had concluded that without compulsory powers its investigations would be thwarted due to the unwillingness of witnesses to cooperate.",

      "bodyText": "A report released last week by the Grattan Institute on services like Uber and Airbnb finds that such peer-to-peer services can provide large benefits to the economy, but that governments need to ensure that both consumers and providers are protected. Hoping the services will just go away is not an option governments can afford to take. It\u2019s amazing how quickly peer-to-peer services have become part of our lives. The phrase \u201cIt\u2019s Uber, but for ...\u201d has become so ubiquitous it has almost reached a dad-joke level of humour. We\u2019re now not so much worrying about whether or not to use Uber, but instead obsessing over our Uber rating. But with this \u201cnew\u201d economy comes challenges \u2013 will it improve productivity at the expense of safety and wages? How should governments react, given the biggest resistance from established players such as the taxi companies and owners? The Grattan Institute\u2019s latest report, \u201cPeer-to-peer pressure: policy for the sharing economy\u201d examines the policy issues involved. The report notes that there certainly are clear economic benefits from the sharing economy. The report estimates Uber can cut more than $500m from Australian taxi bills \u2013 close to 10% of the $5.5bn spent each year by Australians catching a taxi. The report\u2019s author Jim Minifie argues that other sharing platforms are \u201cboosting employment and incomes for those on the fringe of the labour market, and putting thousands of underused homes and other assets to work\u201d. This last point is one that certainly has import in light of continued concerns about productivity. A person\u2019s spare room or granny flat that is unused is essentially an economic asset going to waste \u2013 renting it out via Airbnb puts that asset to work. But a major concern for those for who compete with these new sharing operators \u2013 especially the 68,000 taxi drivers around the nation \u2013 is that the playing field is not level. Taxi regulations and licence fees force taxi fares to be higher than Uber\u2019s, and certainly the evidence in the Grattan Institute report backs this up. A short trip from Canberra Civic to Parliament House costs more in a taxi, even when including a 1.5x Uber surge charge: Amid all the issues regarding unfair competition, the reality is that many taxi drivers provide good service in a dangerous occupation \u2013 the report suggest driving a taxi is possibly 15 times as dangerous as the average job (in 2013-14 in Victoria for example, there were 51 assaults in taxis). But there has also long been a very real sense of customer dissatisfaction with the service. When a survey in Western Australia finds that \u201conly 41% of women feel safe catching a taxi alone at night\u201d you know the industry has an image problem \u2013 justified or not. Uber however gives customers some power. Customers can \u201cestimate fares and car arrival times, view the approach of a driver, monitor actual versus advised routes, streamline payments, and review each trip\u2019s route, time, driver, and fare.\u201d But the ability to rate someone on an app is the very lightest form of consumer protection, and the report argues that while some taxi regulation should be reduced, mostly these relate to licensing and pricing. Instead it argues that not only should the safety regulations remain in place, Uber drivers should also be required to meet certain standards \u2013 such as passing a criminal history and driving history check, a need to have zero blood-alcohol concentration, and for their cars to undergo an initial roadworthy inspection and appropriate follow-up inspections. The introduction of Uber certainly does lead to a drop in taxi driver income and the value of taxi licences. The report notes that even in states where Uber is not legal the value of taxi licences has fallen: But the report argues that while the new entrant will reduce taxi drivers\u2019 and licence owners\u2019 income, they should not for the most part be compensated \u2013 instead only those suffering economic hardship should be assisted. Similarly the Grattan Institute recommends only light regulation of accommodation services like Airbnb. The service, which has grown exponentially in recent years, allows people to rent out rooms in their own house or other properties for short-term periods: The Grattan Institute report finds that a majority of Aribnb activity is not in people\u2019s primary residence \u2013 thus investment properties that would have been used for long-term renters are now being used as de facto serviced apartments. Two concerns which arise from this are that it may increase rents in these areas due to a shortage and that short-term stayers are more likely to cause disruption to neighbours. The report suggests the impact of Aribnb on rents would at worst be very localised \u2013 inner city and more touristy suburbs \u2013 and that mostly it would be minimal given Airbnb residents only account for about 2% of Sydney\u2019s current rental capacity. However concerns about the disruption to neighbours appears to be well founded \u2013 especially within apartment complexes. Within the Melbourne CBD and inner-city, short-term residents are more than three times more likely to be subject to complaints about behaviour than long-term ones: Unfortunately in many states \u2013 such as New South Wales \u2013 the legal remedies to neighbourhood disruptions are more geared for complaints against long-term residents. One better example perhaps is that of Queensland where \u201cparty house\u201d legislation enables local governments to require some or all \u201cparty house\u201d owners to obtain permits, which can include conditions such as occupancy limits and noise controls.\u201d Certainly it is clear that both state and local governments need to adapt to the Airbnb growth by ensuring the ability to \u201cquickly identify the property that is the subject of a complaint and to contact the operator, and to impose escalating penalties, up to bans, on landlords if they breach conditions repeatedly.\u201d But while the peer-to-peer economy may bring with it improved competition, lower prices and better services for consumers, there is some concern that it will reduce wages. This was an issue noted by the shadow assistant treasurer, Andrew Leigh, last year when he released the ALP\u2019s sharing economy policy. But the Grattan Institute\u2019s report would suggest these concerns can be overstated. The report notes that for the most part peer-to-peer services are in areas that already mostly involve independent contractors such as household repair and construction (hipages), household services and errands (Airtasker), writing, website design, IT services and data entry (Freelancer, Envato). The report notes that \u201cfew large platform workforces in manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, healthcare, or financial services\u201d. The report does however see the possibility for such apps to be abused and recommends \u201csham contracting provisions in the Fair Work Act, to deter misclassification of legitimate employees as independent contractors.\u201d The sharing economy is here to stay. For governments to ignore it and hope services like Uber will just go away would be like media organisations pretending that social media is just a passing fad. There are clear economic benefits from this new economy, but also issues for consumers and providers of these new services \u2013 the Grattan Institute\u2019s report provides some good recommendations for governments to follow.",
