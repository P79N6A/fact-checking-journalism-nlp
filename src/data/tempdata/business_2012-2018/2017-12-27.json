      "bodyText": "Right, time for a quick recap. Britain\u2019s stock market has closed at a new peak tonight, on the first trading day since Christmas. The FTSE 100 hit a record closing high, propelled by mining companies as optimism for the world economy in 2018 boosted commodity prices. The smaller FTSE 250 also finished at its highest ever level, partly due to a takeover bid for office manager IWG (which closed 27% higher). The rally came as new data showed that the world\u2019s 500 richest people had collectively gained $1tn in 2017. But it was a volatile day for bitcoin. After surging 13% yesterday, the digital currency has fallen back this afternoon. It\u2019s currently down 4% at $15,094 - having been valued at almost $20,000 10 days ago. This latest fluctuation came after Israel\u2019s stock market regulator suggested it could ban cryptocurrency firms from listing on the Tel Aviv exchange. That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW The jump in commodity prices today helped to push the FTSE 100 to its record high, thanks to the various mining giants that are included in the index. Sky News explains: The rally was supported by an upturn in copper and other commodity prices, which helped to lift global mining giants including Fresnillo, Antofagasta and Glencore. Demand for commodities implies optimism about the outlook for rapidly advancing world economies such as China. Greg McKenna, chief strategist at AxiTrader, said: \u201cThe rally in copper supports expectations that 2018 is going to be a strong year for synchronised global growth.\u201d Of course, the FTSE 100\u2019s run of record highs is less impressive once you remember the tumble in sterling 18 months ago. The pound is still worth around 10% less than before the EU referendum; that made UK companies more affordable to overseas investors, and pumped up the value of their foreign earnings. Peer and pollster Lord Ashcroft tweets: The smaller, more domestically focused FTSE 250 has also hit a new record high tonight: Newsflash: the FTSE 100 index has closed at a new all time high of 7,620 points. Mining companies and supermarkets helped the index rise on the first trading day since Christmas. Newsflash: US consumer confidence has fallen back from its recent highs. The Conference Board\u2019s measure of consumer confidence, just released, dropped to 122.1 in December, down from November\u2019s 129.5 - which was the highest in 17 years. Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, says: \u201cThe decline in confidence was fueled by a somewhat less optimistic outlook for business and job prospects in the coming months,\u201d The wheels are coming off Bitcoin\u2019s recovery. The crypocurrency is now down over 4% at $15,080, which means it has shed over $1,000 since this morning\u2019s early bounce. Over in New York, the US stock market has opened very slightly higher as traders return to work after the Christmas break. The Dow Jones industrial average rose by 16 points, or 0.07%, with the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also managed minuscule gains. While mining companies drove the FTSE 100 to today\u2019s record high, engineering firm Rolls-Royce, building materials group Ferguson, broadcaster Sky and holiday firm TUI all held it back: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has just hit a new all-time high, following the lead set by its little brother, the FTSE 250. The index of the biggest companies listed in London has risen by 22 points, or 0.3%, to 7615 - nudging over the previous intraday record set last Friday. The jump in commodity prices today, such as copper, has pushed mining stocks up (silver miner Fresnillo is the top performer, up almost 3%), with other natural resource companies also up. This means the FTSE 100 has gained around 6.6% this year, lagging behind other indexes such as the US Dow Jones (+25%), Germany\u2019s DAX (+13%) or the Hong Kong Hang Seng (+34%). Maybe it was the prospect of Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys as the highlight of TV on Christmas Day - but according to official HMRC figures, a total of 2,590 people said \u2018bah humbug\u2019 to the festivities and decided to spend the day filling in and submitting their tax return instead. Even as millions of kids across the globe were transfixed by Santa trackers on their computers, in the last hour of Christmas Eve, 92 grown-ups were instead glued to the HMRC\u2019s homepage and sent in their tax returns between 23.00 and midnight. On Boxing Day, a further 7,655 returns arrived at HMRC. HMRC issued the figures as it began its annual plea to the 11m people in Britain who must complete a self-assessment form by January 31. This year it has a new advertising campaign, featuring ducks, of course. The strapline is \u201cDon\u2019t let your tax returns peck away at you\u201d. It\u2019s quackers. Via City AM, here\u2019s a list of the billionaires who gained the most wealth in 2017. The full table is online here. Meanwhile a new poll in Greece has revealed that most citizens are not buying the leftist-led government\u2019s cheery vision of a \u2018clean exit\u2019 from international supervision when the country\u2019s latest bailout programme officially ends next year. Helena Smith reports from Athens In theory, Greeks should be going into the new year on an optimistic note. After seven years of gruelling austerity \u2013 the price of three economic adjustment programmes that have kept the debt stricken country afloat \u2013 Athens\u2019 latest bailout officially expires in August 2018. But the excoriating terms attached to financial rescue won\u2019t end there, with the result that most Greeks are not buying government assertions of post-bailout bliss come the summer. Instead, a poll conducted on behalf of the Real News newspaper by MRB Hellas found that 66.3% of respondents are convinced that international monitoring of Greek finances will continue in some form. A mere 17% accept the official version: that Greece will make a \u2018clean exit,\u2019 weaning itself off borrowed funds by returning to international capital markets. Under that scenario \u2013 one vividly expanded by prime minister Alexis Tsipras \u2013 Athens will have completed a compliance review in time for the country to build up a cash buffer that would enable it to return to markets and begin debt relief talks by the summer. However, only one in four Greeks expect a market return. Three out of five don\u2019t think Greece would be able to tap markets to cover debt payments, according to the survey. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 250 index, which contains medium-sized companies too small for the FTSE 100, has hit a new alltime high. The FTSE 250 has gained 59 points to 20,540 this morning, putting it ahead of the previous record high set on 22 December. Offices group International Workplace Group (IWG) is leading the rally; its shares have jumped by almost 30% today after receiving a takeover offer from Canada\u2019s Onex and Brookfield Asset Management. The FTSE 100 is also close to a record high today, up 13 points at 7606. Other European markets are lagging, though, with Germany\u2019s DAX down 0.3% and Spain\u2019s IBEX down 0.2%. Henry Croft at Accendo Markets explains: Miners are leading the FTSE\u2019s charge higher after Copper traded a fresh three and half year high on Christmas Day, however a significant contribution from Oilers, the index\u2019s largest sector, is aiding the latest foray in record territory. Continued concern as to the impact of last week\u2019s Catalonian election victory for pro-independence parties, as well as a Euro recovery from its Christmas Day \u2018flash crash\u2019, are both weighing on mainland European equities, while US futures are clawing back gains following a negative Boxing day session impacted by an Apple sell-off. Commodity price are charging ahead today (doubtless pleasing billionaires in the raw materials sector). The copper price has hit its highest level in over three years, partly due to optimism that the strengthening global economy will push up demand. The prospect of supply cuts was also a factor - with China ordering its top producer to halt output for a week to combat winter pollution. Metal prices are also rising because the US dollar has weakened (as traders ponder the consequences of Donald Trump\u2019s tax \u2018reform\u2019 plan). Palladium has hit a 17-year high, at $1,069 per ounce, while gold rose to $1.285 per ounce. The world\u2019s roster of billionaires includes Tyler and Cameron Winkelvoss, the internet entrepreneurs who made a big investment in bitcoin back in 2011. Their $11m investment is probably worth around $1.3bn today - although their precise fortune is obviously as volatile as bitcoin itself. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA predicts more wild price moves next year.... Bitcoin is going to continue to fascinate traders heading into the new year and while volatility by its own standards has been tame today, it\u2019s likely to remain very active. Speculators appetite for Bitcoin has been tested in the run up to Christmas, with price having fallen from around $20,000 to not far from half that less than a week later, depending on the exchange. While prices have since rebounded back to around $15,000, it will be interesting to see whether we see the kind of wild gains that we\u2019ve become accustomed to in the coming months, or whether the recent decline has shaken people\u2019s confidence in the cryptocurrency. The world\u2019s wealthiest people needn\u2019t worry about their incomes being squeezed, though. New figures from Bloomberg show that the 500 richest people in the world saw their respective wealth expand by an astonishing 23% during 2017, from $4.4 trillion to over $5.3 trillion. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com, had the best year - gaining over $34bn to become the world\u2019s richest person at around $99.6bn, thanks to the surge in Amazon\u2019s share price. The report also shows that lesser (!) billionaires also had a vintage year, as the strong gains on the world\u2019s stock markets made the richest even richer (at a time when the average household in the UK was suffering from falling real wages) Here are some of the key points from Bloomberg\u2019s report: The 38 Chinese billionaires on the Bloomberg index added $177 billion in 2017, a 65 percent gain that was the biggest of the 49 countries represented. Hui Ka Yan, founder of developer China Evergrande Group, added $25.9 billion, a 350 percent jump from last year, and the second-biggest U.S. dollar gain on the index, after Bezos. Technology billionaire Ma Huateng, co-founder of messaging service Tencent Holdings, became Asia\u2019s second-richest person when his fortune nearly doubled to $41 billion. The number of Asian billionaires surpassed the U.S. for the first time, according to a UBS Group AG and PricewaterhouseCoopers report. The U.S. has the largest presence on the index, with 159 billionaires who added $315 billion, an 18 percent gain that gives them a collective net worth of $2 trillion. Russia\u2019s 27 richest people put behind them the economic pain that followed President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, adding $29 billion to $275 billion, surpassing the collective net worth they had before western economic sanctions began. It was also a banner year for tech moguls, with the 57 technology billionaires on the index adding $262 billion, a 35 percent increase that was the most of any sector on the ranking. Here\u2019s the full story, which could fuel calls for higher wealth taxes to tackle the growing gap between the richest and everyone else. Hmmm, bitcoin\u2019s rally seems to be fizzling out. The digital currency has now dipped back to around $15,500 - wiping out this morning\u2019s gains. This sort of volatility is typical for bitcoin, but maybe the threat of a regulatory clampdown is worrying the market. FXTM\u2019s Hussein Sayed says there are several reasons to be cautious: Israel became the most recent country to propose banning companies based on digital currencies to trade on its stock exchange. A South Korean bitcoin exchange has been hacked, leading it into bankruptcy. Cryptocurrency exchanges are disabling transaction temporarily due to high traffic. Professional traders on CBOE seems to be going short on Bitcoin. Britain should brace itself for another year of falling real wages. In news that might take the sparkle off your new year celebrations, the Resolution Foundation has predicted that pay rises won\u2019t overtake inflation until the end of next year. If they\u2019re right, that would mean the current cost of living squeeze will last two whole years. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Secretary, blames the government\u2019s economic policies: \u201cThe Resolution Foundation report succinctly encapsulates the hardship many across Britain are facing under the Tories and will continue to face in 2018. \u201cAfter seven years of Conservative economic mismanagement, the figures speak for themselves. Real wages are still lower than they were in 2010 and Britain faces a productivity crisis. \u201cThis is not a Government willing or able to raise productivity and living standards for people in Britain.\u201d Tech companies are suffering a hangover this morning, following reports that sales of Apple\u2019s new iPhone X have been disappointing. Yesterday Taiwan\u2019s Economic Daily reported that Apple will slash its sales forecast for the iPhone X in the first quarter to 30 million units, down from 50 million. This hit Asian chip makers overnight, and European technology companies are now following - sending the Stoxx 600 tech index down 1%. Austrian-based Apple supplier AMS is the biggest casualty, down almost 10% We had been expecting new UK mortgage data today, but it turns out that the figures are actually being released by UK Finance (the industry body) tomorrow. As predicted, European stock markets are rather quiet after the Christmas break. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a modest four points (perhaps traders are being distracted by the snowflakes that are now sweeping through the capital). Mining companies are leading the risers; Rio Tinto, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Anglo American have all gained around 1.5% while silver producer Fresnillo is up 2%. Jeremy Cook of World First sums up the situation: Bitcoin\u2019s stumble last week came after two exchanges, CME and Cboe, both launched futures markets allowing investors to bet against the cryptocurrency - as this tweet shows: Shares in cryptocurrency-related companies have also risen today, on the back of bitcoin\u2019s rebound. Reuters has the details: Internet provider GMO Internet Inc, which is engaged in the \u201cmining\u201d of bitcoin, rose 3.1%. Remixpoint Inc, an operator of virtual currency trading post services, gained 5%. The bitcoin futures price has also rebounded from last week\u2019s slump. On CME Group\u2019s new bitcoin derivatives market, the price of a bitcoin in January has risen by $430 today to $16,250. The bitcoin futures prices allow traders to bet on bitcoin falling, or rising, in value. As things stand, bitcoin has gained around 1,600% during 2017, despite last week\u2019s wobble. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, agrees that bitcoin looks like a bubble -- partly because it\u2019s so hard to put a \u2018proper\u2019 value on it. He writes: After crashing by more than $8,000 from an all-time high, Bitcoin is up 3.5% at the time of writing. Although the recent plunge frightened many bitcoin fans, when looking at the relatively short history of bitcoin trading, the price action seems just normal. During 2017 the cryptocurrency crashed by 30% or more six times. Every fall was followed by huge price appreciation until it peaked on 17 December. Whether the Bitcoin bull market is close to an end or just pausing for a short break, remains to be a wild question for 2018. I still believe that Bitcoin is in a bubble formation. However, there\u2019s no effective test to measure at which stage we are currently standing. For example, equity prices may be said in a bubble territory if investors are willing to pay much more for a stock than the intrinsic value which is justified by the discounted divided stream. Similarly, econometric tests may be run on bonds, commodities, currencies or any other asset to come up with a justified value. For Bitcoin, there isn\u2019t any fundamental basis to justify the price. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a subdued atmosphere in the City of London this morning as traders struggle through the drizzle back to their desks following the Christmas break. But bitcoin is defying the quiet mood, and staging a strong recovery after its sharp plunge last week which saw it fall from around $19,000 to just $14,000 in two days. The price of bitcoin surged by 13% on Tuesday, and it\u2019s extending those gains again this morning - currently changing hands at around $16,200. That should relieve those who jumped into the cryptocurrency arena in recent weeks, but may also spur concerns that the bitcoin bubble is still inflating. The rally comes despite another crackdown against bitcoin, this time from Israel. On Monday, Israel\u2019s stock market regulator revealed plans to ban companies based on digital currencies from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Shmuel Hauser, the chairman of the Israel Securities Authority, declared that the public need to be protected from potentially unscrupulous bitcoin operations: \u201cIf we have a company that their main business is digital currencies we would not allow it. If already listed, its trading will be suspended.\u201d Hauser, who clearly isn\u2019t a fan of bitcoin, added: \u201cI think it looks like a bubble, smells like a bubble, acts like a bubble and feels like a bubble. This tough stance may embolden other regulators to take a closer look at bitcoin, which could mean further volatility in the weeks ahead. Apart from bitcoin, City traders will also be watching out for new UK home loan data this morning, and US consumer confidence stats this afternoon (unless they slope off early to finish off the mince pies). The agenda: 9:30am GMT: UK mortgage approvals data for November 3pm GMT: US Consumer Confidence index for December Update: the mortgage approvals figures have been pushed back to Thursday.",

Although the recent plunge frightened many bitcoin fans, when looking at the relatively short history of bitcoin trading, the price action seems just normal. During 2017 the cryptocurrency crashed by 30% or more six times. Every fall was followed by huge price appreciation until it peaked on 17 December.</p> <p> Whether the Bitcoin bull market is close to an end or just pausing for a short break, remains to be a wild question for 2018. I still believe that Bitcoin is in a bubble formation. However, there\u2019s no effective test to measure at which stage we are currently standing.</p> <p>For example, equity prices may be said in a bubble territory if investors are willing to pay much more for a stock than the intrinsic value which is justified by the discounted divided stream. Similarly, econometric tests may be run on bonds, commodities, currencies or any other asset to come up with a justified value.

      "bodyText": "Five months after Boots bowed to public pressure and promised to reduce the price of emergency contraception, it has made good on its promise in less than 3% of its stores. After weeks of controversy last summer over its stance on the price of its generic brand of emergency hormonal contraception (EHC), levonorgestrel \u2013 during which the pharmacy chain said it could not reduce the cost in case it encouraged women to have unprotected sex \u2013 Boots relented and said the price would drop from \u00a326.75 to \u00a315.99 from October. But it said on Wednesday the price had been reduced in only 69 of its 2,500 stores nationwide. A letter last month signed by more than 130 MPs expressed disappointment that cheaper prices for the morning-after pill had not been extended more widely. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which led the initial campaign asking Boots to reduce the price in line with other pharmacies, said the fact the price remained unchanged in the vast majority of branches was \u201cabsolutely scandalous\u201d. Boots said the delay was due to low stock as a result of \u201cbatch failure\u201d and said it offered a free NHS service for EHC in most stores. To be eligible for a free contraceptive pill, a customer needs a prescription from a GP or family planning clinic, according to the Boots website. \u201cWe remain committed to rolling this service out nationally,\u201d said a Boots UK spokesperson. \u201cUnfortunately the manufacturer has experienced a batch failure due to quality issues which means that the stock we were expecting is not now available, and we are now waiting for a new batch to be produced. We thank our customers for their continued patience and reassure them that we are doing all we can to roll this service out to all our stores as soon as possible. \u201cIn July we launched an extended over-the-counter EHC service which includes the generic levonorgestrel in 38 Boots stores in the East Midlands. We\u2019re pleased to confirm that we have now been able to roll this out to a further 31 stores, taking the total number of Boots stores offering the service to 69.\u201d The letter from MPs to Boots, written by Sharon Hodgson, the shadow minister for public health, said it was of particular importance to lower prices for the Christmas period. Over this time, Hodgson wrote, \u201cmany women struggle to access contraceptive services and their usual family planning method. As a result, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, reports that they see an increased number of women facing an unplanned pregnancy following the festive season. \u201cClearly, pharmacy access to emergency contraception is of an even greater importance in December and January.\u201d BPAS tweeted that it was best to \u201cgive Boots a miss\u201d. The charity said in a statement it was \u201cabsolutely scandalous that Boots have failed to deliver on the clear pledge they made to roll out cheaper emergency contraception in all their stores\u201d. It added: \u201cThere can be absolutely no excuse for their pathetically slow pace of progress, other than the fact that they simply do not want to provide women with an affordable product. If Boots cannot source a new version of emergency contraception to sell at a lower price, then they should do the right thing and cut the price of the version they currently have in stock. \u201cRegardless of supply chain delays, affordable emergency contraception is entirely within their gift to give right now \u2013 and every day they refuse to do so, more women are being ripped off, or risking an unplanned pregnancy because they cannot afford Boots\u2019 inflated price tag.\u201d Boots made the commitment to lower the price of its generic morning-after pill in July. It had previously caused outrage by refusing to do so in case it encouraged women to have sex. It said in a statement: \u201cWe would not want to be accused of incentivising inappropriate use, and provoking complaints, by significantly reducing the price of this product.\u201d Even at the reduced price of \u00a315.99, the Boots morning-after pill would still be \u00a32.49 more expensive than products sold by rival pharmacies including Superdrug, Tesco, Morrisons and Asda. On Wednesday, Boots renewed its call for NHS England to make emergency contraception available to women who need it, as the health service in Scotland and Wales already does. \u201cWe are inviting our MPs to work with us to make EHC available free from pharmacies to all women in England and end the current postcode lottery on availability either due to location or age,\u201d it said.",

The bank said the bill, which was signed into law last week, would make it harder for it to deduct past losses from future tax bills. Barclays said the change had reduced the value of its \u201cdeferred tax assets\u201d and would result in an associated one-off charge of about \u00a31bn after tax. It is expected to drag Barclays\u2019 full-year earnings further into the red. The bank lost \u00a3628m in the first nine months of the year due to write-offs related to pulling out of African ventures. Despite the short-term hit, the bank said it expected the tax changes, under which the US corporate tax rate will be cut from 35% to 21% from 1 January, to \u201cpositively impact\u201d its future earnings. Shell also welcomed the tax changes, but said its profits would take a $2bn-$2.5bn (\u00a31.5bn-\u00a31.9bn) hit this year as it factored in the impact on deferred tax assets. \u201cRoyal Dutch Shell expects the potential economic impact of the recently enacted US tax reform legislation to be favourable to Shell and to its US operations, primarily due to the future reduction in the US corporate income tax rate,\u201d the company said. Companies across the world will be forced to take similar actions. In the US, Bank of America, Citigroup, AIG, and the mortgage providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are expected to swallow writedowns of almost $50bn. Switzerland\u2019s UBS said it expected a SFr3bn (\u00a32.3bn) hit and Credit Suisse expects the tax changes to reduce its earnings by SFr2.3bn. Trump said the biggest overhaul of the US tax system since the 1980s would be \u201cfantastic for the economy\u201d. \u201cCorporations are literally going wild over this, I think even beyond my expectations, so far beyond my expectations,\u201d he said. But opponents have said the changes are a gift for rich people, with the Washington DC-based thinktank the Center for American Progress finding that he will save up to $15m a year. Last week, the US president insisted a typical family of four would benefit, saying \u201cthe numbers will speak\u201d, adding that the bill was \u201cnot good\u201d for him personally.",

      "bodyText": "A campaign to return the East Coast rail franchise to public ownership has been launched in protest against the government\u2019s bailout of the Stagecoach-operated Virgin Trains service. More than 10,000 have signed a petition demanding that the London-Edinburgh line be run by the public sector, following the deal announced last month by the transport secretary, Chris Grayling. As part of a rail strategy published by Grayling, the franchise contract of Virgin Trains East Coast will be terminated three years early, potentially forfeiting up to \u00a32bn in premiums due to the Treasury. The franchise will be replaced by a new partnership, which could well involve Stagecoach, which indicated it would bid to run the line. East Coast was operated in the public sector from 2009 until 2015, and rail campaigners are now renewing their focus on the intercity line. Cat Hobbs, a director of the campaign group We Own It, said: \u201cChris Grayling has sent a clear message to the train companies: It doesn\u2019t matter what you do. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you succeed in running our railways. This government will bail you out, no matter what. Pocket the profits \u2013 the public will take the risk. \u201cOur message for Chris Grayling is: no way. Passengers and taxpayers will not pay for this bailout. Train companies have failed too many times. Send Virgin and Stagecoach packing for good \u2013 and make sure you collect what we\u2019re owed before they go.\u201d Hobbs said surveys showed a clear majority of people think that the railways should be run in public ownership and that renationalisation would mean a less fragmented, more efficient and cheaper railway, saving at least \u00a31bn across the network annually. The campaign to renationalise East Coast was backed by the TUC, whose general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cPrivatisation broke it. Public ownership fixed it. And now privatisation has broken it again. Ministers made the same mistake twice. The lesson of East Coast is that railways should be in public ownership. It would mean more reliable and better value rail travel for everyone.\u201d Andrew Adonis, the former transport secretary and now chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, said the early termination of Stagecoach\u2019s East Coast contract \u201clooks set to be the worst transport scandal since the collapse of Railtrack in 2001\u201d. He said: \u201cTaxpayers will have to pick up a bill for hundreds of millions because of the government\u2019s extraordinary decision to bail out Stagecoach and Virgin on the East Coast. If they were going to default on the franchise then Chris Grayling should have refused to renegotiate their contract and set up a state company, as I did when National Express defaulted in 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s not just East Coast which is now in line for a bailout: every other loss-making franchise will expect the same handout from Chris Grayling and the cost could run into billions.\u201d Rail fares are due to rise by 3.4% in January, the highest increase in five years. Grayling\u2019s decision to allow Stagecoach to exit its franchise is expected to come under scrutiny from the Commons public accounts committee in the new year. Virgin Trains East Coast was awarded an eight-year franchise in 2015, but like National Express and GNER before it, has faced financial difficulty after apparently overbidding to run the route. The Stagecoach-Virgin joint venture bid \u00a33.3bn for the route but the bulk of that bill was due after 2020. Stagecoach has said it will honour all its financial commitments, although it is also renegotiating terms with the Department for Transport for the remainder of its term to 2020. Forecast passenger growth has failed to materialise, while the delivery of upgraded infrastructure and new trains ordered by the government is likely to further dent their earnings. Between 2009 and 2015 the East Coast mainline was run by Directly Operated Railways, a DfT-owned company. The DfT said: \u201cOur railway franchising system has brought in more than \u00a33.5bn of private sector investment over the past four years \u2013 delivering more trains, more seats and quicker journeys right across the country to improve services for passengers. \u201cWe have set out our plans to end the operational divide between track and train to cut delays and improve performance \u2013 and the East Coast partnership will be the first of a new generation of integrated regional rail operations. The Department for Transport will continue to receive premiums from the East Coast operator.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
