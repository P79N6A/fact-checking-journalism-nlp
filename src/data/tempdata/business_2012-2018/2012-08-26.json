      "bodyText": "In a last-ditch attempt to overturn the award of the west coast rail franchise to FirstGroup, Virgin Trains co-owner Sir Richard Branson has offered to run the service \"for free\" to allow time for parliamentary scrutiny of the decision. Virgin also renewed its threat to seek a judicial review before the deadline of Tuesday night when contracts are due to be signed by the Department for Transport (DfT), although it hopes pressure from within the Conservative party may sway the transport secretary, Justine Greening, where Labour voices and public petitioning have failed. The DfT said it had \"no reason\" to delay signing off the franchise, which will give FirstGroup, Britain's largest rail operator, the right to run services between London and cities north to Glasgow until at least 2026. FirstGroup bid \u00a35.5bn, according to the DfT, \u00a3700m more than Virgin, the incumbent and closest shortlisted bidder. The actual payments will top \u00a310bn after inflation, more than \u00a31bn above Virgin's offer. Branson and several City analysts have questioned whether the level of FirstGroup's bid is sustainable or if risks a repeat of high-bidding franchisees not seeing out their contracts. Branson on Sunday called for an independent audit of the decision, particularly to check the forecasts of customer numbers, revenue and payments offered to the government. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, he said: \"If this process means extending the current franchise beyond December for a few months, I and my partners at Stagecoach would happily run the extended franchise on a not-for-profit basis, or donate profits to charity. We must ensure that this crucial decision is taken with all the facts correctly assessed and understood.\" A DfT spokesman said: \"We note the offer that one of the bidders appears to have made via the press. However, the winning bidder was decided by a fair and established process and no reason has been advanced to convince DfT not to sign the agreement.\" A Virgin source said it had been making its case at \"all levels\" of the Conservative party, and MPs were making representations to Greening. The source said: \"When we lost CrossCountry to Arriva in 2007 we lost fair and square, by a narrow margin. This is a different ball game altogether, a margin verging on 15% with all the money coming in at the end.\" The offer to run it for free meant that there was \"no rush, and no need for it to be signed off in August. Let it be properly scrutinised by parliament and we'll abide by the decision.\" An online petition started by a Scottish rail passenger calling on the DfT to reconsider has garnered more than 128,000 signatures, a number that all but guarantees a parliamentary debate, although it is unlikely to be held until long after the contract is signed. The transport select committee is planning to question Greening soon over the agreement after its own chair's attempts to delay the award to allow scrutiny were rebuffed. The Virgin source said: \"If this had just been Richard ranting, it would have died off by now. But these are not acolytes \u2013 these are people looking independently saying, we don't believe these figures.\" FirstGroup is confident the franchise will be formalised by Wednesday and views Branson's reaction as confirmation that the railway line is lucrative enough to support the high premium payments it has promised to pay the government. A source close to the company said: \"Our deal represented the best deal for the British taxpayer. We don't have a history of mobilising celebrities, but we do have history of running successful railways.\" He said Branson's offer to keep running the line for a short period was \"neither practical nor feasible\" and added: \"We fully expect the process to be completed this week with the signing of the franchise and we look forward to running west coast trains on December 9.\"",

      "bodyText": "European Central Bank plans to increase lending to struggling eurozone members risks becoming \"addictive like a drug\", Germany's central bank chief warned on Sunday. Jens Weidmann said printing billions of euros and offering them at low interest rates would make life too easy for indebted countries and deter them from making cuts in public expenditure and pushing through economic reforms. \"Such a policy is for me close to state financing via the printing press,\" Weidmann told Der Spiegel magazine. \"We should not underestimate the risk that central bank financing can become addictive like a drug.\" The hard hitting message came as other European nations appeared to soften their stance on Greece and other vulnerable single currency members rescued by ECB loans. Austrian chancellor Werner Faymann said Greece should get more time to repay its debts, in a clear break with Germany, which has so far opposed any delay. Spain is only days away from announcing the details of its \u20ac100bn (\u00a379bn) bank bailout which uses cheap funds from Brussels to underwrite its struggling banking sector. But there are fears Madrid remains vulnerable to collapse and will need further support from eurozone institutions. The ECB is discussing proposals to offer cheap loans when interest rates on government bonds soar towards a pre-determined ceiling. Deep divisions among the eurozone's 17 nations are coming to the fore in response to special pleading by Greece for a relaxation in the terms of its bailout. Antonis Samaras, the Greek prime minister, is touring the continent in search of support from eurozone members for a two year extension on loan repayments under the terms of its second \u20ac130bn bailout package. Athens is concerned that without an extension political unrest will increase and any hopes of reform will disappear. Germany and France said after meetings with Samaras that Greece's leaders must show their commitment to reform before winning concessions. Austria and others in the eurozone's \"core\" of stronger economies have often provided advance warning throughout three years of crisis of the line the bloc's leaders will finally take. \"I see quite a good chance that we will arrive at an outcome with Greece that the Greeks stick to their agreements with the EU but in return get more time for the repayment,\" Faymann told newspaper Oesterreich. \"The most important thing is that the Greeks stick to the reforms and savings targets agreed with us. If that is guaranteed, I am in favour of a delay in the repayment,\" he said, adding that the delay could be two or three years. The ECB's plans have become a focus of dispute, with officials from countries such as Spain and Italy pushing for the central bank's boss Mario Draghi, to sanction widespread intervention in secondary bond markets. ECB officials from northern eurozone countries, including the Netherlands and Finland, only want the central bank to intervene in short bursts when bond yields explode upwards. The ECB is controlled by a board of six nominated officials and a broader committee of representatives from member states. Germany's Finance Ministry is concerned the new ECB plan could endanger the bank's independence, Der Spiegel said. As a condition for ECB support, a country will first have to seek an aid programme from the eurozone's bailout funds. This is subject to approval by finance ministers, and central bankers are worried this makes their action dependent on politicians. To avert this risk, German finance ministry officials were exploring an option where Spain or Italy would make a commitment on economic reforms to the European Commission \u2013 an unelected body \u2013 as a condition for ECB support, rather than accepting an aid programme from the bailout funds, Der Spiegel said. Weidmann, who reflects the broad antagonism inside Angela Merkel's right wing coalition against further bailouts, said: \"In democracies, it is parliaments and not central banks that should decide on such a comprehensive pooling of risks.\" He did not see an immediate inflation threat from the new bond-buying programme, but added: \"If monetary policy allows itself to become a comprehensive political problem solver, its real goal risks moving further and further into the background.\" Weidmann warned against tieing the ECB \"to guarantee keeping member states in the eurozone at any price.\" On Greece's position in the bloc, he said it was important that \"no further damage to trust in the framework of the currency union arises, and that the economic policy requirements of the aid programme retain their credibility.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Almost 20 years ago, when I was a young(ish) reporter on A Certain Tabloid Newspaper, I received one of the more curious of the many briefings I have heard during my career in journalism. Taking me to one side in the newsroom and casting a glance over his shoulder, the news editor told me, sotto voce: \"Ian, get yourself to northern Cyprus. When you get there, don't do anything. Don't talk to anybody. Do nothing. Zilch. I'll try to get you back by the weekend.\" It was Tuesday morning. Clearly this escapade had something to do with Asil Nadir, the tycoon who had a short time before fled to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus in order to escape multimillion-pound theft charges following the collapse of his FTSE 100 conglomerate, Polly Peck. But what was it all about, exactly? \"Sorry mate,\" said the news editor. \"I can't tell you.\" I thought this was ludicrous, and eventually the news editor agreed to enlighten me a little. The chairman of the newspaper, he said, had told the editor that he had discovered that Asil was doing some sort of deal with the British government, one that would allow him to return to the UK. And the chairman was rather proud of this exclusive tip. The only problem was that he was completely wrong. The crime reporter at The Certain Tabloid had called the Serious Fraud Office, who assured him there was no such deal. The home affairs correspondent had telephoned the home secretary, Michael Howard, who told him it was balderdash. \"But the chairman keeps demanding to know who we've got in northern Cyprus, checking out his tip. The editor's told him you're already there. So you'd better get cracking!\" In those days, travelling to the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\", a self-declared state that was recognised by few other governments, and hence had no extradition treaties, involved flying first to Turkey, where there was some jiggery-pokery before the aircraft could take off again. Turkish border guards would come on to the aircraft and check the passports of all the passengers; the pilot would then announce that the aircraft was now controlled by a different company, and had a different flight number, and off we would fly to Kyrenia on the island's north coast. Arriving late that evening I checked into a hotel and, unable to resist the temptation to ignore my instructions, immediately rang an acquaintance who worked for Nadir. I wanted to check the lie of the land. There must be some sort of story here? My acquaintance suggested that I might move next day to the Jasmine Court, a luxury beachside hotel owned by Nadir, which would be much more comfortable. On arrival, the hotel appeared deserted but for a small army of smiling staff, who seemed to know all about me and about my mission. I was provided with a poolside suite at a ridiculously low price. I then drove to Nadir's home a few miles down the coast at Lapta. The entrance to this luxurious bolthole was guarded by a couple of young men sitting inside a gatehouse that resembled nothing so much as a small gun emplacement, with a narrow slit instead of a window. They convinced me that the boss wasn't at home, so I set off to find him in Lefkosa, as the northern section of divided Nicosia is known. Nadir's suite of offices were on the second floor of a small block, and could be accessed only by a very small lift. His secretary made clear that he was too busy to see me, so I asked if I could wait for him on a sofa just outside the door to his office. And there I sat, for hour after hour. It was all very cordial, with the secretary bringing me cups of sweet coffee and glasses of water. But it was clear that Nadir wasn't coming out. And I wasn't going in. I returned to the Jasmine Court, where I was told by a smiling receptionist that my suite was no longer available, and I would have to move to another hotel. Over the next few days, with a bit of effort, the picture became a little clearer, and a lot more extraordinary. The collapse of Nadir's empire had been one of the biggest in British corporate history, and one of the City of London's blue-chip accountancy firms had been appointed as administrators. But while the administrators controlled Polly Peck's assets on paper and in law, in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus and Turkey those properties and businesses remained firmly in the hands of the tycoon's placemen. They couldn't be seized, and they certainly couldn't be sold to pay off any creditors. The situtation was getting a little fraught: one of the administrators had been shot in the leg in Istanbul, another had been beaten about the head and somebody had firebombed a car owned by a Turkish Cypriot lawyer working for the City firm. There had also, apparently, been some unspeakable nonsense involving headless chickens and dead cats. British accountants had taken to arriving in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus in the company of ex-special forces bodyguards. On one occasion a small accountant and two large bodyguards had crammed themselves into the lift to Nadir's office. When it became stuck between floors, nobody had shown any great interest in letting them out. Eventually, I learned, the administrators had in desperation decided to open secret negotiations with a view to selling Polly Peck's local assets to \u2026 Asil Nadir. I had a story. I dashed back to my rather ropy hotel, rang The Certain Tabloid Newspaper, and told the news editor that the chairman appeared to have been on to something: he'd just got all the facts wrong. I, on the other hand, had it all: the secret four-hour talks between the blue-chip accountants and the infamous fugitive; the shooting, the dead cats. I even had a brace of sweating ex-SAS men in a jammed Lefkosa lift. Fabulous. \"File it straight away!\" cried the news editor. I did, and ran headlong into the Contempt of Court Act. Two days earlier, the trial of the boyfriend of a soap star, who was facing assault charges, had been halted because of the way in which several newspapers had reported the matter. The trial judge, clearly furious, had asked the attorney general to consider prosecuting the newspapers for contempt of court. The lawyer at The Certain Tabloid Newspaper was concerned that my story \u2013 if published before Asil Nadir was led into the dock at the Old Bailey \u2013 could similarly wreck his trial, and result in the newspaper being prosecuted for contempt. \"Oh come on,\" I argued, \"he's sitting pretty here, it's going to be years before he faces trial.\" I was referring to what attorneys general call the \"fade factor\", the notion that that the longer the gap between publication of an article and the trial of a defendant, the less substantial is likely to be the risk of serious prejudice to their chances of receiving a fair trial. By the time Nadir stepped into the dock, nobody was going to remember my story, no matter how pleased I was with it. But I lost the argument, the blue pencil came out, and my story was turned into a business report, a dry and anaemic shadow of itself, with no firebombs, no bodyguards, and not a headless chicken in sight. Last week, after returning to Britain to stand trial almost two decades later, Nadir was convicted of stealing \u00a330m from Polly Peck and sentenced to 10 years in jail. He had been driven, the judge said, by pure greed. Like me, the lawyer who wrecked my story all those years ago is now working for the Guardian. I sauntered over to his desk, thinking we could perhaps have a chat about the fade factor. Or perhaps I still wanted to berate him. But it had all been so long ago that the fade factor had worked its magic. Cats? Shootings? Jammed lifts? He couldn't remember what on earth I was talking about. But at least now I can tell the tale. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 August 2012. The original referred to Northern Cyprus throughout, rather than Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, in contravention of the Style guide. This has been corrected.",

I'll try to get you back by the weekend.\"</p> <p>It was Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Clearly this escapade had something to do with Asil Nadir, the tycoon who had a short time before fled to Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus in order to escape <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/22/polly-peck-asil-nadir-analysis\" title=\"\">multimillion-pound theft charges following the collapse of his FTSE 100 conglomerate, Polly Peck</a>. But what was it all about, exactly?</p> <p>\"Sorry mate,\" said the news editor. \"I can't tell you.\"</p> <p>I thought this was ludicrous, and eventually the news editor agreed to enlighten me a little. The chairman of the newspaper, he said, had told the editor that he had discovered that Asil&#xa0;was doing some sort of deal with the British government, one that would allow him to return to the UK. And the chairman was rather proud of this exclusive tip.</p> <p>The only problem was that he was completely wrong. The crime reporter at The Certain Tabloid had called the Serious Fraud Office, who assured him there was no such deal. The home affairs correspondent had telephoned the home secretary, Michael Howard, who told him it was balderdash. \"But the chairman keeps demanding to know who we've got in northern Cyprus, checking out his tip. The editor's told him you're already there. So you'd better get cracking!\"</p> <p>In those days, travelling to the \"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\", a self-declared state that was recognised by few other governments, and hence had no extradition treaties, involved flying first to Turkey, where there was some jiggery-pokery before the aircraft could take off again. Turkish border guards would come on to the aircraft and check the passports of all the passengers; the pilot would then announce that the aircraft was now controlled by a different company, and had a different flight number, and off we would fly to Kyrenia on the island's north coast.</p> <p>Arriving late that evening I checked into a hotel and, unable to resist the temptation to ignore my instructions, immediately rang an acquaintance who worked for Nadir. I wanted to check the lie of the land. There must be some sort of story here?</p> <p>My acquaintance suggested that I&#xa0;might move next day to the Jasmine Court, a luxury beachside hotel owned by Nadir, which would be much more comfortable. On arrival, the hotel appeared deserted but for a small army of smiling staff, who seemed to know all about me and about my mission. I&#xa0;was provided with a poolside suite at a ridiculously low price. I then drove to Nadir's home a few miles down the coast at Lapta.</p> <p>The entrance to this luxurious bolthole was guarded by a couple of young men sitting inside a gatehouse that resembled nothing so much as a small gun emplacement, with a narrow slit instead of a window. They convinced me that the boss wasn't at home, so I set off to find him in Lefkosa, as the northern section of divided Nicosia is known.</p> <p>Nadir's suite of offices were on the second floor of a small block, and could be accessed only by a very small lift. His secretary made clear that he was too busy to see me, so I asked if I could wait for him on a sofa just outside the door to his office. And there I sat, for hour after hour. It was all very cordial, with the secretary bringing me cups of sweet coffee and glasses of water. But it was clear that Nadir wasn't coming out. And I wasn't going in. I returned to the Jasmine Court, where I was told by a smiling receptionist that my suite was no longer available, and I would have to move to another hotel.</p> <p>Over the next few days, with a bit of effort, the picture became a little clearer, and a lot more extraordinary.</p> <p>The collapse of Nadir's empire had been one of the biggest in British corporate history, and one of the City of London's blue-chip accountancy firms had been appointed as administrators. But while the administrators controlled Polly Peck's assets on paper and in law, in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus and Turkey those properties and businesses remained firmly in the hands of the tycoon's placemen. They couldn't be seized, and they certainly couldn't be sold to pay off any&#xa0;creditors.</p> <p>The situtation was getting a little fraught: one of the administrators had been shot in the leg in Istanbul, another had been beaten about the head and somebody had firebombed a car owned by a Turkish Cypriot lawyer working for the City firm. There had also, apparently, been some unspeakable nonsense involving headless chickens and dead cats.</p> <p>British accountants had taken to arriving in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus in the company of ex-special forces bodyguards. On one occasion a small accountant and two large bodyguards had crammed themselves into the lift to Nadir's office. When it became stuck between floors, nobody had shown any great interest in letting them out.</p> <p>Eventually, I learned, the administrators had in desperation decided to open secret negotiations with a view to selling Polly Peck's local assets to \u2026 Asil Nadir.</p> <p>I had a story.</p> <p>I dashed back to my rather ropy hotel, rang The Certain Tabloid Newspaper, and told the news editor that the chairman appeared to have been on to something: he'd just got all the facts wrong. I, on the other hand, had it all: the secret four-hour talks between the blue-chip accountants and the infamous fugitive; the shooting, the dead cats. I even had a brace of sweating ex-SAS men in a jammed Lefkosa lift. Fabulous.</p> <p>\"File it straight away!\" cried the news editor.</p> <p>I did, and ran headlong into the Contempt of Court Act.</p> <p>Two days earlier, the trial of the boyfriend of a soap star, who was facing assault charges, had been halted because of the way in which several newspapers had reported the matter. The trial judge, clearly furious, had asked the attorney general to consider prosecuting the newspapers for contempt of court. The lawyer at The Certain Tabloid Newspaper was concerned that my story \u2013 if published before Asil Nadir was led into the dock at the Old Bailey \u2013 could similarly wreck his trial, and result in the newspaper being prosecuted for contempt.</p> <p>\"Oh come on,\" I argued, \"he's sitting pretty here, it's going to be years before he faces trial.\"</p> <p>I was referring to what attorneys general call the \"fade factor\", the notion that that the longer the gap between publication of an article and the trial of a defendant, the less substantial is likely to be the risk of serious prejudice to their chances of receiving a fair trial. By the time Nadir stepped into the dock, nobody was going to remember my story, no matter how pleased I was with it.</p> <p>But I lost the argument, the blue pencil came out, and my story was turned into a business report, a dry and anaemic shadow of itself, with no firebombs, no bodyguards, and not a headless chicken in sight.</p> <p>Last week, after returning to Britain to stand trial almost two decades later, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/23/asil-nadir-10-years-jail-polly-peck\" title=\"\">Nadir was convicted of stealing \u00a330m from Polly Peck and sentenced to 10&#xa0;years in jail</a>. He had been driven, the judge said, by pure greed.</p> <p>Like me, the lawyer who wrecked my story all those years ago is now working for the Guardian. I sauntered over to his desk, thinking we could perhaps have a chat about the fade factor. Or perhaps I still wanted to berate him.</p> <p>But it had all been so long ago that the fade factor had worked its magic. Cats? Shootings? Jammed lifts? He couldn't remember what on earth I was talking about. But at least now I can tell the tale.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 August 2012.

    "webTitle": "Why George Osborne believes everything is going to plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has had a long, tough summer. It started with a series of U-turns after a badly received budget and it has ended with a deficit that is bigger than it was this time last year. Critics say that Bradley Wiggins and Usain Bolt have done more to boost the economy than the chancellor. The Treasury, unsurprisingly, says that this is not the time to hit the panic button, that despite strong evidence to the contrary everything is going to plan, and that there is still time to turn things round before a general election in 2015. This view is built on a number of assumptions. Assumption No1 is that Britain's problems are deep and structural, rooted in a culture of excessive borrowing and a narrow productive base. Osborne is right about that. Assumption No2 is that any respite from bad economic news will be short-lived because rising activity in the third-quarter will be the result of a bounce back from the lost production caused by an extra bank holiday in June and a modest boost from the Olympics. The reason for this sombre assessment is that Greece is now in limbo until after the US presidential election in early November, prolonging the uncertainty caused by the crisis in the eurozone. Osborne is making contingency plans for a single currency reduced from 17 to 16 countries but believes that Barack Obama's influence with Angela Merkel means there is no immediate prospect of the plug being pulled on Athens. Like Obama, the chancellor is far from convinced that Europe could prevent contagion in the event of a Greek departure and wants reassurance that the return of the drachma would be accompanied by swift action by the European Central Bank to buy bonds of other vulnerable countries in unlimited quantities. On past form, the chances of it all going wrong are worryingly high. UK business surveys suggest that the next few months are going to be difficult for manufacturers, construction firms and the services sector alike. Although the revisions to the second-quarter growth figures painted a slightly less gloomy picture than the original estimates, the underlying performance of the economy is extremely weak. Consumer spending is down. Investment is down. And trade is a drag on growth. The third assumption is that Europe is to blame for Britain's flatlining economy over the past 18 months, with fears over a break-up leading to mothballed investment decisions, higher funding costs for banks and fewer export opportunities. This is a questionable interpretation of recent events since it skates over the impact of government decisions on the domestic economy \u2013 infrastructure cutbacks on the construction sector and the increase in VAT on consumer spending, for example \u2013 but Osborne's intends to stick to his story that his attempts to remedy the ills of the structurally flawed economy he inherited from Labour have been hampered by events on the other side of the Channel. Blaming Gordon Brown for 50% of his troubles allows the chancellor to reject calls from the Keynesian left for a package of tax cuts and spending increases to tackle the economy's demand deficiency and weak investment. Osborne is convinced that this would be simply a sugar rush and that firms, fearful of an even tougher deficit-reduction plan in the future to pay for the fiscal stimulus, would continue to hunker down and that the financial markets would exact a heavy price for the backsliding on deficit reduction. Blaming the other half of his woes on the eurozone enables Osborne to deflect criticism from those on the right demanding that he respond to the stagnation of the economy with even deeper spending cuts. The Treasury divides the deficit into two parts: cyclical and structural. The cyclical bit should disappear when the economy finally recovers from the recession; the structural bit will remain even when growth has returned to its long-term trend. His fourth assumption, therefore, is that the damage caused to the economy from the double-dip recession is temporary rather than permanent. There will be no big stimulus package this autumn, although the Treasury is looking at ways of making public spending \"growth rich\" while leaving the deficit-reduction plan unchanged. This idea has been backed by the International Monetary Fund and involves saving money on the running costs of government (current spending) and allocating it instead to public investment projects (capital spending). Housing, the sector that helped drag the UK out of the recession in the 1930s, will be targeted. Assumption No5, therefore, is that the Bank of England will do the heavy lifting when it comes to stimulating the economy. Even though Threadneedle Street has already bought up a third of UK gilts (government bonds) through its quantitative easing programme, Osborne does not think monetary policy is now \"pushing on a piece of string\". The mix of policy will continue to be fiscal conservatism and monetary activism, which raises the question of whether the Treasury will grant the Bank powers to buy up a wider range of assets, including corporate bonds. Sir Mervyn King has always said that this is a political decision since it would involve deciding which companies should benefit from actions designed to drive down borrowing costs, but that if Osborne wants to sanction such a move the Bank would act as the Treasury's agent. Would the chancellor be prepared to take this step? Well, attention is being paid to the debate raging in the economics profession about the merits of replacing inflation targets with nominal GDP targets. This sounds esoteric but actually has big implications for the conduct of monetary policy, with its supporters saying it provides a way of recovering the output lost since the start of the crisis and its opponents warning that it will lead to inflation raging unchecked. In normal circumstances, the value of all the goods and services produced by the UK economy increases by around 5% a year. Part of this is a real increase in output and part of it is inflation. The Bank of England has a target of keeping inflation at 2%. Under a nominal GDP target of 5%, the split between real output growth and inflation would be of no consequence for the Bank's monetary policy committee. It would follow expansionary policies if nominal GDP growth were below 5% \u2013 and contractionary policies if it were above 5%. Over the past year, the Bank would have been under pressure to ease monetary policy more aggressively because nominal GDP growth has been 3%. That would have meant more quantative easing sooner and the purchase of a wider range of assets. Osborne is not about to ditch the inflation target, even though it would be perfectly justifiable to look at the monetary policy regime given its failure to prevent the buildup of dangerous imbalances in the economy in the runup to the crisis. But the interest in nominal GDP targeting suggests monetary activism will be stepped up as early as this autumn. Why? Because Osborne's final assumption is that there needs to be solid evidence of recovery by this time next year if David Cameron is to avoid being a one-term prime minister.",

Osborne is convinced that this would be simply a sugar rush and that firms, fearful of an even tougher deficit-reduction plan in the future to pay for the fiscal stimulus, would continue to hunker down and that the financial markets would exact a heavy price for the backsliding on deficit reduction.</p> <p>Blaming the other half of his woes on the eurozone enables Osborne to deflect criticism from those on the right demanding that he respond to the stagnation of the economy with even deeper spending cuts. The Treasury divides the deficit into two parts: cyclical and structural. The cyclical bit should disappear when the economy finally recovers from the recession; the structural bit will remain even when growth has returned to its long-term trend. His fourth assumption, therefore, is that the damage caused to the economy from the double-dip recession is temporary rather than permanent.</p> <p>There will be no big stimulus package this autumn, although the Treasury is looking at ways of making public spending \"growth rich\" while leaving the deficit-reduction plan unchanged. This idea has been backed by the International Monetary Fund and involves saving money on the running costs of government (current spending) and allocating it instead to public investment projects (capital spending). Housing, the sector that helped drag the UK out of the recession in the 1930s, will be targeted.</p> <p>Assumption No5, therefore, is that the Bank of England will do the heavy lifting when it comes to stimulating the economy. Even though Threadneedle Street has already bought up a third of UK gilts (government bonds) through its quantitative easing programme, Osborne does not think monetary policy is now \"pushing on a piece of string\". The mix of policy will continue to be fiscal conservatism and monetary activism, which raises the question of whether the Treasury will grant the Bank powers to buy up a wider range of assets, including corporate bonds.</p> <p>Sir Mervyn King has always said that this is a political decision since it would involve deciding which companies should benefit from actions designed to drive down borrowing costs, but that if Osborne wants to sanction such a move the Bank would act as the Treasury's agent.</p> <p>Would the chancellor be prepared to take this step? Well, attention is being paid to the debate raging in the economics profession about the merits of replacing inflation targets with nominal GDP targets. This sounds esoteric but actually has big implications for the conduct of monetary policy, with its supporters saying it provides a way of recovering the output lost since the start of the crisis and its opponents warning that it will lead to inflation raging unchecked.</p> <p>In normal circumstances, the value of all the goods and services produced by the UK economy increases by around 5% a year. Part of this is a real increase in output and part of it is inflation. The Bank of England has a target of keeping inflation at 2%.</p> <p>Under a nominal GDP target of 5%, the split between real output growth and inflation would be of no consequence for the Bank's monetary policy committee. It would follow expansionary policies if nominal GDP growth were below 5% \u2013 and contractionary policies if it were above 5%. Over the past year, the Bank would have been under pressure to ease monetary policy more aggressively because nominal GDP growth has been 3%. That would have meant more quantative easing sooner and the purchase of a wider range of assets.</p> <p>Osborne is not about to ditch the inflation target, even though it would be perfectly justifiable to look at the monetary policy regime given its failure to prevent the buildup of dangerous imbalances in the economy in the runup to the crisis. But the interest in nominal GDP targeting suggests monetary activism will be stepped up as early as this autumn. Why? Because Osborne's final assumption is that there needs to be solid evidence of recovery by this time next year if David Cameron is to avoid being a one-term prime minister.</p>",
