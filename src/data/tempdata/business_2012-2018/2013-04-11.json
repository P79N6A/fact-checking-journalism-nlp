      "bodyText": "US authorities have charged a former KPMG partner with insider dealing after he admitted giving his golfing buddy share tips in exchange for cash, jewellery and $25,000 worth of concert tickets. Scott London, a senior KPMG partner in southern California, was charged with conspiracy to commit fraud and for leaking non-public information about companies he audited, including diet supplement firm Herbalife and shoe company Skechers. The complaint filed by the securities and exchange commission (SEC) said London's stock tip leaks had made his golf partner Bryan Shaw, a Californian jeweller, more than $1m (\u00a3650,000). In exchange for the tips, Shaw gave London roughly 10% of the profits he made in the form of bags stuffed with up to $50,000 cash in $100 bills, a $12,000 Rolex watch, other jewellery and concert tickets, according to the filing. One of London's tips was that Herbalife was about to become a private company. \"That is going to be where you make a ton of money,\" London said, according to the criminal filing, \"Because, you know, we'll know that.\" US attorney Andr\u00e9 Birotte said London \"chose to betray the trust placed in him as a financial auditor and to tip the trading scales for the benefit of insiders like himself\". \"The public has every right to fully expect a level playing field in our financial markets\" he added. London, who was fired by KPMG immediately when it discovered he had passed on the information, said the tips began in 2010 in casual conversations with \"someone I'd known from the golf club\". In an interview with the Wall Street Journal he said he didn't realise Shaw was trading on the information he was leaking. \"Once he told me he had traded, that's when my heart sank,\" London said. \"We had discussions, this wasn't right \u2013 I knew it was wrong \u2013 but it just happened.\" However, London admitted he continued to provide Shaw with information about Herbalife, Skechers and Deckers Outdoors.

These are bonuses for going bust.\" Mann said the former bosses of the failed bank should pay the money back immediately and called for an inquiry to investigate why they were paid the cash. \"The money needs to be repaid, and if it's not, these people need to be drummed out of the financial services sector entirely,\" he said. \"This is emerging as a full-blown scandal and warrants a full inquiry by the select committee. We need to know what due diligence was done.\" Pat McFadden, a member of the parliamentary commission on banking and one of the authors of its scathing report published last week, said: \"These guys are incredible. This sounds like amazing rewards for failure. \"The banking commission report showed the bank was pursuing an ultimately disastrous strategy that should result in them taking responsibility, not getting extra rewards.\" McFadden also called for an investigation into the payments, which he described as \"a reward for being taken over by us \u2013 the taxpayers\". He said: \"It's our money. We bailed them out for their failure \u2013 and they got bonuses for it.\" On top of the cash bonuses, the seven directors received 8,600 share bonuses at an undisclosed price band. The bonuses were paid on top of salary, pension contributions, awards in lieu of pension and redundancy payments. Andy Hornby, the chief executive of HBOS at the time of its near collapse and takeover by Lloyds, collected \u00a3251,000 cash and 2,051 shares as a result of the change of control. The others cashing in were Peter Cummings, the head of corporate lending who was fined \u00a3500,000 by the Financial Services Authority; Mike Ellis, former finance director; Philip Gore-Randall, former chief operating officer; Colin Matthew, who led the expansion into Ireland and Australia that cost the bank \u00a314.5bn; Jo Dawson, former risk director; and Dan Watkins, her successor. HBOS's 2008 annual report said the payments were awarded \"in accordance with contractual entitlements\". It said HBOS's remuneration committee excluded \"payments in relation to the 2008 financial year [the year HBOS failed]\", but allowed the directors to benefit from awards due to them for other years. It said: \"[When] these arrangements were settled, Lloyds did not own HBOS. All decisions with respect to the redundancy or severance terms applicable to departing HBOS senior executives, including pensions, were made by the HBOS remuneration committee or board of HBOS, prior to the acquisition by Lloyds.\" A spokesman for Lloyds was unable to state why the bosses received the money, or if any have decided to pay the cash back. Hornby, now chief executive of bookmakers Coral, declined to comment. The revelation of the change of control bonuses comes as pressure mounts on HBOS's former bosses to pay back millions of pounds of pension contributions collected from the bank after the parliament report blamed \"a colossal failure of management\" for the bank's near-collapse. Sir James Crosby, the boss of HBOS until 2006 and the man described by the parliamentary commission on banking standards as the \"architect of the strategy that set the course for disaster\", has said he will give up his knighthood and 30% of his \u00a3580,000-a-year HBOS pension. David Cameron's spokesman said it was \"a matter for their consciences and judgment\" whether HBOS's other former bosses follow his example. Matthew is collecting a HBOS pension worth \u00a3416,000-a-year. Cummings is on a \u00a3344,000 pension.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Stobart Group, one of Britain's biggest trucking companies, will go on trial for contempt after a whistleblower partially won a high court case against him and another executive. Andrew Tinkler and Trevor Howarth, Stobart Group's legal director, may have lied in order to silence Peter Elliott, a former contractor in an aviation company owned by Tinkler, a judge ruled on Thursday. The case comes at a time of turmoil for the company, which owns other businesses including Southend airport. On Wednesday night Investec, its senior City broker, resigned following the ousting last week of Avril Palmer-Baunack, Stobart's executive chairman. She lost her position in a boardroom shake-up after only 71 days in the job. The company said it had decided the role of executive chairman was no longer appropriate, an \"odd explanation\" according to one analyst. Last year Howarth masterminded the Stobart empire's controversial move into the legal aid market, setting up Stobart Barristers, a cut-price service which connects businesses to barristers without having to go through a solicitor. Elliott, who turns 46 on Friday, was sentenced to three months in jail in June 2009 after breaking an injunction brought against him by various Stobart parties. The high court in Manchester heard that he had tried to kill himself on several occasions following his prison experience. He complained he had been the victim of \"an orchestrated smear campaign\" which \"made me look like a scrote\". Ever since his release Elliott has sought to challenge his conviction by proving that Stobart executives lied in order to persuade a judge to impose the gagging order in late 2008. On Thursday the judge, Mr Justice Pelling, QC, ruled there were five instances where Tinkler may have lied and two occasions when Howarth may not have told the truth. He dismissed 15 other allegations of contempt made by Elliott, including a number against another executive, William Stobart, the youngest son of the firm's founder, Eddie Stobart. His judgment did not apportion any guilt, he stressed, but merely ruled that \"a sufficiently strong prima facie case\" had been established for him to send the seven allegations to a civil trial for contempt. Tinkler is not only the firm's chief executive but also brother-in-law to William Stobart. Between them they hold 12% of the group. Neither Tinkler, Howarth or Stobart were in court. Tinkler and Howarth later issued a statement via a PR agency saying: \"We are confident in the judicial process in which we both expect in the fullness of time to be exonerated. \" Speaking after the hearing, Elliott said: \"This is an important victory on the road to justice.

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund has warned central banks to be alert to the potentially damaging side-effects of ultra-low interest rates and \"unconventional\" measures to boost growth after the deep slump of 2008-09. While backing the use of exceptional action to prevent the collapse of the financial system, the IMF said the risks would grow the longer the stimulus was kept in place. The Washington-based body used a chapter in its latest global financial stability report to note that rock-bottom interest rates and purchases of government bonds might be shifting instability from banks to other parts of the financial system or other parts of the global economy. It added that care would have to be taken when central banks decided the time was right to remove the stimulus. \"Interest rate and unconventional policies conducted by the central banks of four major regions \u2013 the euro area, Japan, the UK and the US \u2013 appear indeed to have lessened vulnerabilities in the domestic banking sector and contributed to financial stability in the short term,\" the IMF said. \"Policymakers should be alert to the possibility, however, that financial stability risks may be shifting to other parts of the financial system, such as shadow banks, pension funds and insurance companies. The central bank policy actions also carry the risk that their effects will spill over to other economies.\" Finance ministers and central bank governors will discuss the results of what the report called their \"unprecedented intervention\" when they gather in Washington next week for the IMF spring meeting. The discussions will be given added spice by Japan's recent decision to use ultra-loose monetary policy to lift the economy out of deflation. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, central banks cut interest rates and also created electronic money in an attempt to compensate for the drying up of credit from hamstrung commercial banks. Although the measures were intended to be temporary, borrowing costs have not been raised and quantitative-easing (QE) programmes have not been reversed. Minutes of the latest meeting of the US Federal Reserve's policymaking committee revealed that a debate was under way over whether the pace of QE should be slowed, and this approach was backed by the IMF in its report. In the UK, the Fund noted that the impact of the Bank of England cutting its key interest rate to 0.5% \u2013 the lowest in its 319-year history \u2013 and \u00a3375bn of quantitative easing could be encouraging lenders to \"evergreen loans rather than recognise them as non-performing\". There was a possibility, the IMF said, that non-viable firms were being kept alive, and that this explained the low level of corporate insolvencies in Britain. \"Despite their positive short-term effects for banks, these central bank policies are associated with risks that are likely to increase the longer the policies are maintained. The current environment shows signs of delaying balance sheet repair in banks and could raise credit risk over the medium term. Markets may be alert to these medium-term risks, as central bank policy announcements have been associated with declines in some bank stocks and increases in yield spreads between bank bonds and government bonds,\" the report said. \"Central banks also face challenges in eventually exiting markets in which they have intervened heavily, including the interbank market; policy missteps during an exit could affect participants' expectations and market functioning, possibly leading to sharp price changes.\" The IMF said monetary policy \u2013 measures affecting the money supply, interest rates and exchange rates \u2013 should remain stimulative until recovery was well established but added that policymakers needed to exercise \"vigilant supervision to assess the existence of potential and emerging financial stability threats\". It suggested tougher capital and liquidity standards, coupled with the need to make provisions against future losses, adding: \"The crisis has shown that corrective policies enacted after the risks materialise may be too late to contain damage to financial stability.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tomorrow, finance ministers will hold their next meeting in Dublin. On the agenda -- Cyprus's fiscal reform programme, the situation in Portugal, and whether to agree to extend the existing Portuguese and Irish rescue loans. But that's all for today. Here's a very brief closing summary. \u2022 The cost of Cyprus's financial rescue package has swelled to \u20ac23bn, documents disclosed last night have shown. The extra cost, around \u20ac6bn, will fall on Cyprus itself, whose contribution has risen to \u20ac13bn (details at 8.46am) The report predicts that the Cypriot economy will contract by over 12% in 2013 and 2014. Many bloggers (9.16am onwards) and City analysts (see 1.59pm) believe the forecasts are too optimistic. \u2022 Olli Rehn admitted tonight that the Commission cannot be sure how sharply Cyprus will contract (see 6.21pm) \u2022 Cyprus's government has denied that it will be forced to sell its gold reserves, although the report does state that Nicosia will raise \u20ac400m through a gold sale (see 1.23pm). \u2022 There are fears tonight that Portugal may need extra help from its lenders. Leaked documents, and analysis from Open Europe, both point to problems with funding that could prevent its return to the markets (see 4.03pm). \u2022 Mario Draghi has written to Cyprus's president, warning him not to fire central bank governor Panicos Demetriades (see 3.35pm onwards). \u2022 Eurogroup president Jeroem Dijsselbloem has predicted that finance ministers will agree to extend Portugal and Ireland's bailout loans tomorrow (see 2.43pm) \u2022 And in Athens, the Greek government has warned Germany that the long-standing issue of war reparations will not be forgotten.... (see 12.03pm) We'll be back tomorrow - until then, thanks and goodnight! Just in - Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for monetary union, has given an interview to the Wall Street Journal / Dow Jones in which he admits that the full scale of Cyprus's recession is hard to calculate. Their ace Matina Stevis has reported the key points on Twitter: We've reported several times today that City experts don't believe Cyprus's economic targets are realistic (for example). Rehn is also pushing for decisions on European banking union to be taken soon. On a lighter note, the Central Bank of Ireland has accidentally minted 10,000 \u20ac10 coins honouring Irish writer James Joyce with an mistake in them. The coins unfortunately include an extra word in a key quote from Ulysses: Joyce wrote: \"Ineluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought through my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read.\" But alas the word 'that' has been added to the second line: Our Dublin correspondent, Henry McDonald, has written the full story here. Bit of an embarrassment for the Bank of Ireland (although probably not enough to get the governor sacked -- perhaps Mario Draghi will write another letter just in case.....). And speaking of quotes... Danny Gabay, of City consultancy Fathom, has mischievously reminded us of a quote from Draghi's predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, when Cyprus entered the single currency in 2008: For a small, open economy like Cyprus, euro adoption provides protection from international financial turmoil which often has a disproportionate impact on smaller economies. Up to a point.... Cyprus' government spokesman has confirmed that the ECB president's letter had landed in Nicosia, reports Helena Smith \"We can confirm receipt of the letter,\" the spokesman Christos Stylianides said. He also had a retort for Draghi. \"There is no issue for the government because its position has, and is, well-known regarding the autonomy of institutions,\" he added. \"One thing is political handling [of an issue] and quite another the technocratic handling of an issue.\" Two interesting articles about Portugal to flag up - both warning that it is likely to need more financial help soon. 1) On at the Financial Times, Peter Spiegel is clasping another leaked document - showing that a second bailout is likely. Peter writes: Although the document doesn\u2019t address it directly, it makes clear that Portugal will have a very hard time avoiding a second bailout, since its financing needs in 2014 and 2015 \u2013 its first years after bailout funding runs out in July 2014 \u2013 will be substantially higher than they were during the pre-crisis period. 2) Open Europe, the think tank, also believes Portugal needs more help. It's new research paper (pfd) outlines how the Portuguese economy is deteriorating sharply. This could mean that Portugal taps the ECB's new bond-buying scheme, the Outright Monetary Transactions plan. Here's Open Europe's analysis of Portugal's problems: Domestic demand, government spending and investment are contracting sharply, leaving the country heavily reliant on uncertain export growth to drive the economy. By cutting wages and costs at home (internal devaluation), Portugal has in recent years improved its level of competitiveness in the eurozone relative to Germany. However, this trend actually started to reverse sharply in 2012, meaning that the divergence between countries such as Portugal and Germany has begun growing again \u2013 exactly the sort of imbalance the eurozone is seeking to close. In its austerity efforts, Portugal is now coming up against serious political and constitutional limits. For the second time, the country\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against public sector wage cuts \u2013 a key plank in the country\u2019s EU-mandated austerity plan \u2013 while the previous political consensus in the parliament for austerity has evaporated. In combination, it will be increasingly difficult for Portugal to sell austerity at home and consequently to negotiate its bailout terms with creditor countries abroad. Portugal may well need some further financial assistance before long. It is unlikely to take the form of a full second bailout, but could involve use of the ECB\u2019s OMT bond-buying programme, assuming Portugal can return to the markets fully beforehand (even briefly). Ta Nea has uploaded a copy of Mario Draghi's letter to the Cyprus president - click here to see it in Greek - in which the ECB chief warns against dismissing central bank head Panicos Demetriades. As reported in our previous post, it reminds Nicos Anastasiades that a central bank governor cannot be dismissed unless he can no longer fulfill his duties or if he is guilty of serious misconduct. As if Cyprus\u2019 problems weren\u2019t big enough, the island\u2019s president also appears to face mounting criticism from European Central Bank Mario Draghi over his treatment of the governor of the central bank of Cyprus, reports Helena Smith, our correspondent in Athens. She writes: The ECB president Mario Draghi has reportedly taken the unusual step of reading the riot act to Cypriot president Nikos Anastasiades following mounting pressure on the island\u2019s central bank governor to resign. In a withering letter, Draghi warned the embattled leader that firing Panicos Demetriades over his handling of Cyprus\u2019 worsening crisis would go against European Union law with which, he said, local legislation had to be \u201ccompatible.\u201d \u201cAs you know any decision to remove a governor from his duties is subject to judicial investigation by the Europe Union court,\u201d he wrote adding that a central bank governor could only be sacked if he was found to be incapable of conducting his duty or judged guilty of serious misconduct. The measures, he reminded Anastasiades, had been put in place to guarantee the independence of central bank governorship. Draghi's letter was first reported by Ta Nea, Grece's leading daily, this afternoon - here's the story. Helena adds: Demetriades, who was appointed by former president Demetris Christofias, a veteran communist, has faced furious criticism over his role in the collapse of the island\u2019s second largest lender, Laiki, and enforced losses depositors with over 100,00 euro at Laiki and the Bank of Cyprus will be forced to shoulder. Anastasiades says the central bank should have restructured Laiki after it was nationalized last year. The governor, who insists that the stringent terms of Cyprus\u2019 bailout was a \u201cpolitical decision,\u201d now faces criminal charges when a parliamentary investigation commences next week. Draghi wrote the letter after the Cypriot leader sacked Demetriades\u2019 deputy, Spyros Stavrinakis, earlier this week, Ta Nea said. I just called the ECB, but alas they won't comment on the letter, or confirm that it was sent. The ECB statute, though, is pretty clear that central bank governors can't be fired on whim. Here's the key section: STATUTE OF THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKS AND OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK 14.2. The statutes of the national central banks shall, in particular, provide that the term of office of a Governor of a national central bank shall be no less than five years. A Governor may be relieved from office only if he no longer fulfils the conditions required for the performance of his duties or if he has been guilty of serious misconduct. A decision to this effect may be referred to the Court of Justice by the Governor concerned or the Governing Council on grounds of infringement of these Treaties or of any rule of law relating to their application. Such proceedings shall be instituted within two months of the publication of the decision or of its notification to the plaintiff or, in the absence thereof, of the day on which it came to the knowledge of the latter, as the case may be. [end] Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who leads the eurogroup of finance ministers (not without incident, either) has predicted that Ireland and Portugal will be granted extensions to their bailout loans on Friday. Dijsselbloem is in Cork ahead of a two-day meeting of finance ministers that starts tomorrow. He told a press conference this afternoon that the eurogroup will probably decided to grant Ireland and Portugal seven more years to repay their loans from the European Union. Dijsselbloem said: The intention is very positive. I hope that we will be able to finalise that tomorrow (quotes via Reuters) Extending the loans will lower the repayment burden, making it easier for both countries to return to the financial markets. But there are particular concerns over Portugal today, and whether it will soon need more help.... (more to follow) Two City analysts have added to fears that Cyprus won't be able to hit the fiscal forecasts drawn up in its bailout plan. Christoph Weil of Commerzbank reckoned that the country could get close to the growth figures\"if everything goes according to plan\", but warns that everything probably won't. In particular, Weil suspects that Cyprus will not return to growth in 2015, when it is expected to grow by 1.1%. AP's Juergen Baetz reports: \"If there are any problems and there are significant downside risks then it could be much worse, and a combined contraction of 20% is within the range of the possible,\" Weil said.... \"The country must go through a painful and wide-ranging restructuring of its economy, with half of its banking sector evaporating, I think it will take at least three years for the economy to bottom out.\" Jonathan Loynes of Capital Economics also believes the economic projections contain \"a considerable degree of optimism\": This could force Cyprus to undertake further fiscal tightening to meet its borrowing targets and casting doubt over the sustainability of the bail-out. Juergen's full story is online here: Cyprus bailout swells to $30 billion Officials in Cyprus are playing down the prospect that the country will be forced to sell a chunk of its gold reserves Government spokesman Christos Stylianides confirmed in the last few minutes that a gold sale is an option for financing the bailout. The responsibility, though, remains with Cyprus's central bank. Stylianides also confirmed that the Cyprus financing package has risen to \u20ac23bn. The Cyprus central bank had already denied this morning that the country's gold reserves would be sold. Here's what the document outlining Cyprus's financing needs states: It is envisaged to use the allocation of future central bank profits of approximately [EUR 0.4bn], subject to the principle of central bank independence and provided such profit allocation is in line with CBC rules and does not undermine the CBC duties under the Treaties and the Statute. Cyprus is estimated to have around 13.9 tonnes of gold, and would have to sell over 10 tonnes, at today's prices, to raise \u20ac400m. Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, reckons it would the biggest bullion sale by a Eurozone central bank since France sold 17.4 tonnes in the first half of 2009, and would set a precedent. Ash added: What's interesting for Cyprus now is the EC's wording in the proposal. Advising Cyprus to sell off \"excess\" gold could be seen to point to the very heavy share of gold in the central bank's currency reserves - a massive 62%. Yes, that's pretty much in line with the Eurozone as a whole (when you include the ECB's holdings), but it also suggests an attempt to get around the legal block on financing state deficits by selling central-bank assets via some or other \"target\" level for gold as a percentage of reserves. In Athens, the government is holding fresh talks with top officials from the Troika today. Here's a photo of IMF mission chief Poul Thomsen arriving for another meeting with Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras: Negotiations between the two sides have been grinding on for days. They are still trying to reach an agreement on overhauling the Greek civil services. The Troika is reportedly pushing for 7,000 officials to be laid off this year, rising to 20,000 by the end of 2014. Athens is refusing to accept this - thus the ongoing talks.... The question of whether Germany owes Greece billions of euros of unpaid reparations following the second world war has flared up today. Greek foreign minister Dimitris Avramopoulos has hit back after Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, suggested that Greece should drop the issue and focus on reforming its economy. Avramopoulos insisted that the matter was still important to Athens, and would be resolved in the courts (the full statement is below). Some background: This issue of German war reparations has been a running sore in Greece since the financial crisis began. As well as the thousands of Greek lives lost and destruction of infrastructure, the Bank of Greece also made loans to the occupying forces during the 1941-1944 Axis occupation. Some historians have claimed that compensation was never paid. And their voices have become louder since the first Greek bailout, and the demands placed on the country by the eurozone. And now.... A new report, commissioned by the Greek government, had reportedly found compelling evidence that Germany is liable for large sums (one earlier estimate puts the bill at \u20ac162bn). It was put together by a group of researchers who ploughed through masses of official documents, dating back decades. (here's a report in To Vima). Asked about the issue this week, Sch\u00e4uble flatly rejected the suggestion that Germany could, let alone would, pay such compensation today. Sch\u00e4uble apparently told a German newspaper (details here) that: Greece has achieved a lot, but still had a long way to go. [Greeks] should not lose their direction. Regarding the claims for reparations, I see no hope because this matter was cleared up a while ago. This prompted today's rare official comment on the issue, with Avramopoulos declaring: The reforms being carried out in Greece bear no relation \u2013 and can bear no relation \u2013 to the issue of German reparations. What\u2019s more, German reparations are an issue that the Greek state has been raising for many years now. Whether this case has been resolved or not is determined by international justice, given that, by its nature, this issue concerns international law and the international justice organs. Greece is not \u2018losing its focus\u2019 on the reform policy, despite the great sacrifices the Greek people are shouldering. It seems certain that the issue will get more attention once the official report is published later this year. In Greece, the unemployment rate has risen to a new record high -- as its long recession continues to scar the country's workforce. The jobless rate is now 27.2%, data for January from the Hellenic Statistical Authority showed. That's double the eurozone average of 12% recorded in February (Greece's data lags a month behind). Greece's jobless rate is the worst in the eurozone, behind Spain (26.3%) and Portugal (17.5%). The full data is online here. This graph shows how the jobless rate has risen steadily, although there was a welcome blip last December (when the rate dropped to 25.7%) The data also shows that 31.4% of women are out of work in Greece, compared to 23.9% of men. And the youth jobless crisis is as awful as ever - with 59.3% of 15-24 year olds out of work. Just a reminder. The Cyprus debt sustainability analysis, which includes the economic forecasts and various measures being taken under the bailout, is online here: Assessment of the public debt sustainability of Cyprus And the financial details of the package, explaining how it has risen to \u20ac23bn, is online here: Assessment of the actual or potential financing needs of Cyprus. (those documents are hosted by the FT, after first reaching Reuters and Dow Jones last night) It's easy to be critical of the European authorities over the Cyprus bailout plan (see this morning's earlier posts). But the finger of responsibility must also be pointed at Nicosia, and the fateful decision to impose a levy on all savers. Although abandoned, this move created genuine alarm among Cypriots when it was announced as part of Bailout Plan A on 16 March. We then had a week of political deadlock after MPs sensational rejected the plan, cunning plans including for a National Solidarity Fund which went nowhere, before president Nicos Anastasiades accepted the current programme after a dramatic meeting in Brussels (liveblogged here). A better plan originally would surely have kept the bill below its current \u20ac23bn (although perhaps the original \u20ac17bn target was always too optimistic). Blame all round. To quote Pawelmorski again: The Cyprus negotiations started with a high-risk gamble \u2013 that depositors would bear part of the pain of restructuring; unfortunately, the Cypriot parliament then tried to bluff the Troika whilst declaring loudly that they didn\u2019t have any cards at all, and a catastrophe was duly created. Another great blog post on Cyprus, from fund manager @pawelmorski: Cyprus: Of Course It\u2019s A Template It's a comprehensive take-down of the calculations within the Debt Sustainability Analysis. These economic forecasts are dismissed as \"worse than literally laughable\": Can exports really fall by just 5%, with a ravaged banking industry and the introduction of capital controls? Won't the losses suffered by wealthy depositors have a rather larger impact on spending (measures by consumption)? The wealth effect wiping deposit worth 60% of GDP will apparently barely register on consumption \u2013 the Troika must think the deposits are all Russian. Compare with Iceland (50% drop in investment) or Latvia (40%), the former boosted by devaluation the latter by an intact financial system.... These projections cross the line from wild optimism into contemptuously half-hearted fable. This table is a bare-faced lie. Another experienced voice warning that Cyprus's adjustment programme may go off the rails..... Morski also makes an important point about the lessons we can learn from Cyprus as a model for the future. Eurozone officials clearly moving to a system where taxpayers pay the price of rescuing banks to one where investors and large depositors do. For a non-Template, the Cyprus solution drops some cracking clues as to EU priorities. At present, the capital structure is equity, subordinated debt, then senior debt and depositors together. The new hierarchy will be: equity, sub debt, senior debt, uninsured depositors, and then at the top of the mountain as the floodwaters rise, voters insured depositors (remember that while a very big chunk of deposits are uninsured, almost all depositors are) the ECB and the Eurosystem... There are good arguments for shifting the burden of bank rescues onto those who directly and deliberately benefit in the good times. There is also a powerful case that Europe's banks aren't strong enough, or investors confident enough, to make the shift now.... More here: Cyprus: Of Course It\u2019s A Template (PS: If you're on Twitter you really should be following @pawelmorski - especially if you enjoy a good scrap) From Cyprus, blogger Yiannis Mouzakis also fears that the targets outlined in the debt sustainability analysis are too optimistic. This is the key chart, predicting how Cyprus's debt as a percentage of GDP (the crucial measure of debt sustainability in the Troika's book), will rise and then fall through its bailout programme. The grey area shows the areas of uncertainty - depending if the bailout programme goes better than expected, or worse. Greece has been a textbook example of over-optimistic forecasts, which were missed, leading to extra austerity, leading to lower growth, leading to missed targets. Yiannis fears a repeat, given the Troika's track record: With a policy mix that has consistently surprised negatively on growth in every country that is either in a program or simply is forced to follow the Commission\u2019s diktat, fiscal targets that are repeatedly missed even from the most compliant of countries like Portugal, and overall DSAs from the troika that are the definition of revision, the adverse scenario in the DSA of Cyprus is the one that is most likely to materialise. More here: Another sorry debt sustainability analysis Over on FT Alphaville Joseph Cotterill has crunched through the debt sustainability analysis, and is pretty alarmed: The amount Cyprus had to find from depositors went up by \u20ac5bn in the nine or so days between the initial stupid idea and the deal they all eventually reached. Cyprus is a (roughly) \u20ac18bn economy. If you didn\u2019t laugh you\u2019d cry. Joseph has concluded that the sums are seriously unconvincing, and driven by the need to keep the total bill for international lenders at \u20ac10bn: Does the whole DSA read like an attempt to squeeze everything below this limit rather than set the numbers to what would be sustainable, even if they come out higher? Why yes it does. He's also drilled into one particular detail: that Cyprus is expected to roll over up to \u20ac1bn of domestic law long-term debt, through a \"voluntary sovereign bond exchange\" covering bonds maturing in 2013-15. It's a messy situation - but he reckons it could see eurozone heading for its second sovereign debt restructuring (after Greece, of course). More here: The eurozone\u2019s second sovereign restructuring? Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis and other developments in the world economy. The scale of the crisis in Cyprus has been exposed by the official report into the country's debt sustainability assessment, which leaked on Wednesday afternoon [covered in yesterday's blog]. The total rescue package has jumped to \u20ac23bn, from \u20ac17bn, and it won't be a surprise that it's Cyprus, not its international lenders, filling the gap. Thanks to the documents [posted online last night by the FT's invaluable Peter Spiegel], you can see that Cyprus is now expected to contribute \u20ac13bn to the financing of the adjustment programme. When the deal was first agreed, it was \u20ac7bn. Here's how it breaks down: 1) \u20ac10.6bn from restructuring the banking sector (the resolution of Laiki Bank, and \"bailing-in\" junior debt and uninsured deposits in the Bank of Cyprus) 2) \u20ac600m from raising corporation tax, taxes on capital income, and increasing the bank levy on deposits raised by banks and credit institutions 3) \u20ac400m through selling some of Cyprus's gold reserves 4) \u20ac1.4bn through privatisations. Cyprus is also expected to haggle a lower interest rate on its loan from the Russian Federation. And roll over some of its own bonds (of which more shortly....) The unexpected jump in the refinancing package underlines quite how botched the original bailout was, and the scale of the damage caused to Cyprus during those mad March days. Cyprus is expected to suffer a dire double-digit slump -- contracting by 8.7% this year and another 3.9% in 2014. This chart explains: But it could be much worse -- as the debt sustainability analysis itself warns: There is a non-negligible risk of a cycle of household and corporate defaults propagating through the economy, leading to further banking sector losses, worsening of labour market conditions, stronger than expected fall in house price and a prolonged loss of business and consumer confidence. All factors we've seen played out in other eurozone bailouts since the crisis began. And if these forecasts are too optimistic, it's Cyprus who will be dipping back into its pocket. The DPA again: In the event of underperformance of revenues or higher social spending needs, the Cypriot government has committed to stand ready to take additional measures to preserve the programme objectives, including by reducing discretionary spending, taking into account adverse macroeconomic effects. A strategy that worked so well in Greece... The DPA is also pretty blunt about the changes wrought on the Cypriot financial sector. The Cyprus-domestic banking sector used to represent 550% of the country's GDP. Not any more.... As a result of these actions the Cypriot banking sector has been downsized immediately and significantly to [350]% of GDP. And the conclusion of the Debt Sustainability Analysis could send shivers through Nicosia: A number of downside and upside risks to the debt projections may impact on the actual debt trajectory. Although difficult to quantify, downside risks appear dominant. There's some good analysis of the reports already this morning (which I'll link to next). But take a look yourself: Assessment of the public debt sustainability of Cyprus Assessment of the actual or potential financing needs of Cyprus (with another nod to the FT). I'll also be tracking other events in the eurozone and beyond through the day....",

This could mean that Portugal taps the ECB's new bond-buying scheme, the <strong>Outright Monetary Transactions</strong> plan.</p> <h2>Here's Open Europe's analysis of Portugal's problems:</h2> <ul> <li>Domestic demand, government spending and investment are contracting sharply, leaving the country heavily reliant on uncertain export growth to drive the economy.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>By cutting wages and costs at home (internal devaluation), Portugal has in recent years improved its level of competitiveness in the eurozone relative to Germany. However, this trend actually started to reverse sharply in 2012, meaning that the divergence between countries such as Portugal and Germany has begun growing again \u2013 exactly the sort of imbalance the eurozone is seeking to close.</li> <li>In its austerity efforts, Portugal is now coming up against serious political and constitutional limits. For the second time, the country\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against public sector wage cuts \u2013 a key plank in the country\u2019s EU-mandated austerity plan \u2013 while the previous political consensus in the parliament for austerity has evaporated.</li> <li>In combination, it will be increasingly difficult for Portugal to sell austerity at home and consequently to negotiate its bailout terms with creditor countries abroad.</li> <li>Portugal may well need some further financial assistance before long. It is unlikely to take the form of a full second bailout, but could involve use of the ECB\u2019s OMT bond-buying programme, assuming Portugal can return to the markets fully beforehand (even briefly).</li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5166cd6de4b0566fd276bd3f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-11T14:49:17.492Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mario Draghi's letter</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ta Nea</strong> has uploaded a copy of <strong>Mario Draghi</strong>'s letter to the Cyprus president - <a href=\"http://www.tanea.gr/news/economy/article/5011435/aysthrh-epistolh-ntragki-se-n-anastasiadh-gia-ta-peri-payshs-toy-kentrikoy-trapezith/\">click here to see it in Greek</a> - in which the ECB chief warns against dismissing central bank head Panicos Demetriades.</p> <p>As reported in our previous post, it reminds <strong>Nicos Anastasiades</strong> that a central bank governor cannot be dismissed unless he can no longer fulfill his duties or if he is guilty of serious misconduct.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-11T14:52:56.217Z\">at 3.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5166ca14e4b06bae4b7cdab4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-11T14:35:00.866Z\">3.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Draghi warns against firing Cyprus's central bank governor - report</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f70bf05b-6169-44f6-a448-ffd58c9ca0d4\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/11/1365690660603/83ba5a17-ac2a-4705-b0bc-ec8635c94936-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), speaks during a news conference at the bank's headquarters on April 4, 2013 in Frankfurt, Germany.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), has reportedly written to Cyprus's president warning against dismissing his central bank governor.

When the deal was first agreed, it was \u20ac7bn.</p> <h2>Here's how it breaks down:</h2> <p><strong>1) \u20ac10.6bn from restructuring the banking sector (the resolution of Laiki Bank, and \"bailing-in\" junior debt and uninsured deposits in the Bank of Cyprus)</strong></p> <p><strong>2) \u20ac600m from raising corporation tax, taxes on capital income, and increasing the bank levy on deposits raised by banks and credit institutions </strong></p> <p><strong>3) \u20ac400m through selling some of Cyprus's gold reserves</strong></p> <p><strong>4) \u20ac1.4bn through privatisations.</strong></p> <p>Cyprus is also expected to haggle a lower interest rate on its loan from the Russian Federation. And roll over some of its own bonds (<em>of which more shortly....</em>)</p> <p>The unexpected jump in the refinancing package underlines <strong>quite how botched</strong> the original bailout was, and the scale of the damage caused to Cyprus during those mad March days.</p> <p>Cyprus is expected to suffer a dire double-digit slump -- contracting by 8.7% this year and another 3.9% in 2014. This chart explains:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0b2fb588-0e0c-4eda-9d3a-84acbe27e301\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/11/1365666079875/-460x276.png\" alt=\"Cyprus GDP - from DSA April 2013\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: EC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it could be much worse -- as the debt sustainability analysis itself warns:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a non-negligible risk of a cycle of household and corporate defaults propagating through the economy, leading to further banking sector losses, worsening of labour market conditions, stronger than expected fall in house price and a prolonged loss of business and consumer confidence.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>All factors we've seen played out in other eurozone bailouts since the crisis began.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>And if these forecasts <strong>are</strong> too optimistic, it's Cyprus who will be dipping back into its pocket. The DPA again:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the event of underperformance of revenues or higher social spending needs, the Cypriot government has committed to stand ready to take additional measures to preserve the programme objectives, including by reducing discretionary spending, taking into account adverse macroeconomic effects.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>A strategy that worked so well in Greece...</em></p> <p>The DPA is also pretty blunt about the changes wrought on the Cypriot financial sector. The Cyprus-domestic banking sector used to represent 550% of the country's GDP. Not any more....</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a result of these actions the Cypriot banking sector has been downsized immediately and significantly to [350]% of GDP.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the conclusion of the Debt Sustainability Analysis could send shivers through Nicosia:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>A number of downside and upside risks to the debt projections may impact on the actual debt trajectory.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Marks &amp; Spencer reported its seventh consecutive quarterly fall in clothing sales but said it could do better and still had the support of shareholders. The chief executive, Marc Bolland, who is under pressure to improve performance at Britain's biggest clothing retailer, said sales in the key general merchandise division fell 3.8% in the fourth quarter, while food sales rose by 4%. Asked whether he felt his job was under threat, Bolland said: \"I'm thoroughly enjoying the job and the challenge. It is a lot of hard work and it will take a long time but we expected that.\" He said recent internal surveys found that morale at the company was at record highs, despite reports of unrest among senior staff. The fall in clothes sales was less than some analysts had predicted and pleased investors, with shares rising 4% on Thursday. Two top-10 shareholders said Bolland still had time to make improvements following a boardroom overhaul last year. Richard Marwood, a senior fund manager at Axa Investment Management, M&amp;S's fourth-biggest shareholder, said: \"It's not a personal issue of Marc Bolland. I don't have any issue with his management. But from a strategy point of view they put a lot of investment into improving sales lines and we haven't seen much of an impact from that. \"The jury is still very much out on the new team and if I do have a slight nagging doubt, I think it's that they are very keen on parachuting in new high-profile people that they think are going to wave a magic wand. However, I feel it is an expensive way to do things with no guarantees.\" Nick Moakes, head of public markets at the Wellcome Trust, the seventh-biggest M&amp;S shareholder, said he would be giving Bolland at least another 12 months to turn the business around. \"Their supply chain had been a mess and they are bringing this process into the 21st century. I think Marc's getting frustrated with the attention he's getting because too many people have been too short-term,\" Moakes said. \"If I was sitting in his seat, I would be deeply frustrated with everything that has happened in the past three months, but the real excitement happens in the next few years. They have had some bad screwups, but that said, any company can have that, and it's about how they react that's important. \"All things being equal, I would expect to be seeing an improvement in market responsiveness and signs of improved margins. If we come to two years' time and there has not been a margin improvement and they're still not buying the right dresses then we'd be concerned.\" Last year M&amp;S brought in the former Jaeger and Debenhams boss Belinda Earl as style director and the former Victoria's Secret chief creative officer Janie Schaffer to head the lingerie and beauty division. Underlying sales were ahead by 0.6% in the three months to the end of March, which the group said was its strongest quarterly growth in two years. For the year, general merchandise sales were down by 4.1% while food sales were up by 1.6%. Bolland said: \"We have always said that this quarter was a challenging one. We have very good trends out there but we can improve. We can do better than this, We are working hard at doing this and will see the first collections coming out in autumn-winter certainly with an improved line. \"We delivered an excellent result in food, with performance well ahead of the market, as customers continued to trust us for provenance and quality.\" Bolland has said investors and shoppers must wait at least until the launch of M&amp;S's autumn-winter collection because current ranges were chosen by managers and directors he had since replaced. However, he urged investors not to judge him on one line of clothing. M&amp;S will report its annual results in May and profits are expected to fall for the second year running. In 2011 profits declined for the first time in three years, by 1% to \u00a3705.9m. Shore Capital is forecasting a fall to \u00a3629m for the year just ended, rising to \u00a3682m in the current year. Bolland said more than 50% of extra stock had been bought for key items, after a number of popular lines sold out too quickly last year. The group's share of the clothing and footwear market fell to 11.1% from 11.5% a year earlier, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel. Despite the problems in general merchandise, the company's food business has been doing well and benefited after rivals were caught up in the horsemeat scandal.",

It is a lot of hard work and it will take a long time but we expected that.\"</p> <p>He said recent internal surveys found that morale at the company was at record highs, despite reports of unrest among senior staff.</p> <p>The fall in clothes sales was less than some analysts had predicted and pleased investors, with shares rising 4% on Thursday.</p> <p>Two top-10 shareholders said Bolland still had time to make improvements following a boardroom overhaul last year.</p> <p>Richard Marwood, a senior fund manager at Axa Investment Management, M&amp;S's fourth-biggest shareholder, said: \"It's not a personal issue of Marc Bolland. I don't have any issue with his management. But from a strategy point of view they put a lot of investment into improving sales lines and we haven't seen much of an impact from that.</p> <p>\"The jury is still very much out on the new team and if I do have a slight nagging doubt, I think it's that they are very keen on parachuting in new high-profile people that they think are going to wave a magic wand. However, I feel it is an expensive way to do things with no guarantees.\"</p> <p>Nick Moakes, head of public markets at the Wellcome Trust, the seventh-biggest M&amp;S shareholder, said he would be giving Bolland at least another 12 months to turn the business around.</p> <p>\"Their supply chain had been a mess and they are bringing this process into the 21st century. I think Marc's getting frustrated with the attention he's getting because too many people have been too short-term,\" Moakes said.</p> <p>\"If I was sitting in his seat, I would be deeply frustrated with everything that has happened in the past three months, but the real excitement happens in the next few years. They have had some bad screwups, but that said, any company can have that, and it's about how they react that's important.</p> <p>\"All things being equal, I would expect to be seeing an improvement in market responsiveness and signs of improved margins. If we come to two years' time and there has not been a margin improvement and they're still not buying the right dresses then we'd be concerned.\"</p> <p>Last year M&amp;S brought in the former Jaeger and Debenhams boss Belinda Earl as style director and the former Victoria's Secret chief creative officer Janie Schaffer to head the lingerie and beauty division.</p> <p>Underlying sales were ahead by 0.6% in the three months to the end of March, which the group said was its strongest quarterly growth in two years. For the year, general merchandise sales were down by 4.1% while food sales were up by 1.6%.</p> <p>Bolland said: \"We have always said that this quarter was a challenging one. We have very good trends out there but we can improve. We can do better than this, We are working hard at doing this and will see the first collections coming out in autumn-winter certainly with an improved line.</p> <p>\"We delivered an excellent result in food, with performance well ahead of the market, as customers continued to trust us for provenance and quality.\"</p> <p>Bolland has said investors and shoppers must wait at least until the launch of M&amp;S's autumn-winter collection because current ranges were chosen by managers and directors he had since replaced. However, he urged investors not to judge him on one line of clothing.</p> <p>M&amp;S will report its annual results in May and profits are expected to fall for the second year running. In 2011 profits declined for the first time in three years, by 1% to \u00a3705.9m. Shore Capital is forecasting a fall to \u00a3629m for the year just ended, rising to \u00a3682m in the current year.</p> <p>Bolland said more than 50% of extra stock had been bought for key items, after a number of popular lines sold out too quickly last year.</p> <p>The group's share of the clothing and footwear market fell to 11.1% from 11.5% a year earlier, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel.</p> <p>Despite the problems in general merchandise, the company's food business has been doing well and benefited after rivals were caught up in the horsemeat scandal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "WH Smith's outgoing chief executive Kate Swann is leaving on a high as shares in the company soared to an all-time high, capping a remarkable turnaround for the UK's biggest newsagent. Giving her final presentation to the City before she quits in June after 10 years, Swann took a final swipe at rivals including John Lewis, Debenhams and Laura Ashley, all recently exposed for demanding retrospective discounts from suppliers. Revealing a boost in half-year profits, Swann said WH Smith suppliers had not been sent similar letters despite heavy cost-cutting during her 10 years in charge. She said: \"We have a slightly more sophisticated relationship than that. I find it amazing that they've done that and as you can see the suppliers aren't happy. We'd rather have a good relationship with our suppliers.\" Swann, who will step down this year after turning around WH Smith's fortunes through a rapid expansion of its stores in airports, train stations and hospitals, saw sales in the six months to the end of February down 4% to \u00a3638m, with pretax profits up 4.5% to \u00a369m. Its high street sales fell 6% to \u00a3422m, while the so-called travel stores held flat at \u00a3216m. The fall in sales was put down to the continuing struggling economy, but cost savings including the introduction of energy efficient tills, which require less maintenance, and trialling such things as time switches on store coolers that switch off overnight have helped turn a profit. Swann said she still had no plans on where her career would take her next, but admitted she would use some of her time to finish the final instalment of the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy, which helped prop up poor book sales in the past year. \"I'm halfway through the third book and need to know what happens. Work-wise I have no medium-term plans at the moment, but would like to take a full-time job again,\" she said. In the last six months, WH Smith opened 12 new travel stores and trialled new concept stores, including more focus on children's books. Steve Clarke, who replaces Swann later this year, said: \"Kids' books are particularly resilient and have been holding up well, while non-fiction like Jamie Oliver's 15-minute meal cookbook have also been successful. But fiction has been a struggle.\" The company also revealed it has bought the brand rights for former high street chain Past Times and will start selling branded retro products in its stores. The company did a similar deal with the Gadget Shop in 2010. Swann's criticism of retailers' treatment of suppliers comes after it was revealed last month that John Lewis had written to suppliers demanding a discount of up to 10%, while similar letters were sent by Laura Ashley, Debenhams and Accessorize Monsoon. During her tenure, she implemented a plan for a share-buyback scheme, snapping up \u00a3223m-worth of shares and her last act was to increase the dividend by 13%.",

      "bodyText": "Cyprus stands on the brink of the abyss. Its debts are high, its banks are crippled, its pivotal financial services sector is being dismembered. Now the country's 800,000 inhabitants and ex-pats have woken up to find that the cost of financial rescue has gone up by \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.1bn) in the past month \u2013 and they will have to find every last cent themselves. It goes without saying that the already deeply flawed rescue plan for Cyprus is now a complete and utter dud. Nobody outside of the so-called troika \u2013 the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 believes the growth and financial projections sketched out in the debt sustainability analysis leaked overnight. The details of the bailout are as follows. Cyprus will need \u20ac23bn to see it through its debt crisis, up from an original \u20ac17bn. The troika's share of the rescue remains unchanged at \u20ac10bn \u2013 Cyprus will now have stump up \u20ac13bn rather than \u20ac7bn. It would appear that most of that will come from uninsured bank deposits of more than \u20ac100,000. Those savers will now face losses well in excess of the 10% envisaged under the original plan. Fresh economic forecasts for Cyprus were included in the sustainability analysis. These are more realistic than the 5% cumulative drop in national output previously envisaged for 2013 and 2014 but not nearly realistic enough. The troika expects gross domestic product to shrink by 12.5% but that looks wildly optimistic in a country that has three main sources of income: financial services (dead in the water); property (ditto) and tourism (cheaper in the Turkish part of Cyprus thanks to a currency depreciation). A 25% drop in GDP over the next couple of years will probably prove closer to the mark. The figures contained in the analysis look as if they have been massaged to come up with a profile for debt that meets with the approval of the IMF, which believes a burden of much more than 120% of GDP is unsustainable. The chances of debt peaking at 126% of GDP in 2015 is for the birds, even on the troika's own upbeat economic forecasts. Cyprus will comfortably miss these debt projections, and on past form that will lead to demands from its creditors for further self-defeating austerity in an attempt to get back on track. Deposit holders will lose even more of their savings, assuming that there is anything left to seize. So what conclusions can be drawn from this sorry tale? Firstly, that the catastrophic bungling of the past month has been costly, both in terms of the size of the bailout and the message sent out to savers in the rest of the eurozone that their deposits could also be at risk. Secondly, that Cyprus is seen as expendable by Angela Merkel in run-up to the German elections in September. There were more sensible options available \u2013 a more generous bailout, for example \u2013 but these have been rejected for fear that German voters would react badly. Thirdly, that the insistence on continuing with policies that are clearly failing means that the eurozone debt crisis will go on and on. Finally, unless there is a change of strategy the options for Cyprus are limited; endure decades of pain, secure a second (and perhaps even a third) bailout, or leave the euro.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "The long, slow death of the UK coal industry", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Nothing better symbolised the passing of a great industry, referred to reverentially as \"King Coal\", than the lowering of one of the last chunks to have been cut at Maltby colliery next to the grave of the \"unknown miner\" in the town's cemetery last weekend. His had been the only body to be recovered when a gas explosion ripped through the underground galleries 90 years ago, killing 27 men. Those present wiped away tears, as last rites on an industry that had sustained this community for more than a century were read by the local priest. Wreaths were laid and the colliery brass band played the miners' hymn, Gresford, itself an anthem to another disaster. The short service had been billed as a \"thanksgiving and prayer for the future\", although the many newly redundant must have wondered what future there could be in an area where good jobs are scarce. Strangely, the closure of Maltby came days before Margaret Thatcher, widely seen as the butcher of the coal industry, passed away. This South Yorkshire town was built on coal, and thanks to Maltby's huge reserves of \"black gold\", locals had held out some hope that despite the many closures that have hit the area over the past 30 years, they might just wash past the mine with its 540 or so employees. At its height, Maltby cut more than a million tonnes of coal each year \u2013 most of it going on the \"merry-go-round\" railway wagons to Drax power station, with the rest heading for the Monckton coke works near Barnsley. Earlier in the day, in Worksop, north Nottinghamshire, the shopkeeper at a local bric-a-brac shop tells me that, although the local mines had closed in the late 1980s and early 90s, the area was still scarred by heavy unemployment. (They barely even burn coal around here any more: I ask him if he might know a coal merchant I could talk to. \"You would be hard placed to find a local coal merchant around here,\" he replies.) In today's Britain, the roll call of Yorkshire villages that once made nightly news in the early 80s as near civil war gripped the coalfields \u2013 places such as Dinnington, Thurcroft, Rossington, Wath, Armthorpe and Grimethorpe \u2013 have quietly slid away from public consciousness. In the last 15 years, international coal prices have been buoyant, Britain's remaining privately operated deep mines becoming more productive and profitable, with a couple, including Hatfield Main in Ed Miliband's Doncaster constituency and the Unity Mine in South Wales even being reopened. The price of coal increased from around $30 per short ton in 2000 to around $150 per short ton in September 2008. But as of October 2008, the price per short ton had declined to $111.50. Prices further declined to $71.25, as of October 2010. Even as this long winter extended its grip, over 40% of Britain's electricity needs have been met by coal \u2013 the bulk of it now imported. But earlier this year came news that work on a new seam at Maltby had had to be suspended, because of unusually high levels of gas, and the pit was to be shut. On top of a disastrous fire at Europe's biggest producing mine at Daw Mill in Warwickshire and the mothballing \u2013 closure with the option of reopening later \u2013 in January of Aberpergwm drift mine in South Wales, this means that there are only three remaining deep mines left in operation in Britain. These are Hatfield and Kellingley in Yorkshire, and Thorseby in Nottinghamshire. Another Notts pit, Harworth, is currently mothballed. This means we are on the verge of losing both an irreplaceable skills base and, potentially, access to all the remaining coal. And this in a country now virtually dependent on gas and oil supplies from elsewhere; Britain was recently awaiting a gas supply ship from Qatar, after being days away from running out of supplies altogether. Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), explains: \"We are going to be beholden to other countries and suffer the consequences. Once upon a time profitable pits helped ones that weren't making profits because they were developing new coal faces. Now there is no slack.\" Those close to the industry speak bitterly about missed opportunities. Last year, the government turned its back on investing in a new combined heat and power plant, planned to be built next door to Hatfield colliery. EU Commission officials said the now-scrapped power station would have been 'the most advanced of its type in Europe'. Kitchen says: \"For just a minuscule amount of the money wasted on the banks, thousands of jobs could have been created in cutting-edge energy production in South Yorkshire and Britain might have been ahead of the curve when it came to 'clean coal technology' and carbon capture.\" The arguments may be old, but they are still relevant. One ex-miner, Mick (not his real name), still employed by Maltby's operating company, Hargreaves, says: \"They've shut it, because coal prices have dipped. We all know that there are millions of tonnes of the stuff down there.\" Standing at the entrance to the pit, as the procession prepares to get under way, Kevin Barron, the area's MP, agrees. \"We have seen far too many of these closures. Let's see where we are in 50 years' time when we really need these sources of energy,\" he says. Barron helped lead the charge for his old workplace when Michael Heseltine reeled off a list of planned closures in 1992, moving seamlessly in a Commons statement from \"Maltby\" to sonorously intone: \"Point of Ayr in Scotland\". Point of Ayr was, in fact, in North Wales. In response, a bunch of Frickley miners, also from the militant Yorkshire coalfield, headed south in retribution to Heseltine's country pile in Oxfordshire and blocked his gates with a lorryload of coal. Later, some of them dug up part of his front lawn, claiming to have located a large seam of coal running beneath. Maltby was reprieved back then, and it was so successful until recently that it hired 70 young apprentices. As Mick notes: \"Many of the men had genuinely thought they would see out their working lives here.\" Back at the parade in the town centre, the colliery band and the NUM banners lead a long procession cheered on by Saturday shoppers, perhaps remembering fathers or grandfathers, for most in Maltby will have had some connection with the industry. The final sendoff to more than 100 years of mining in the area has the feel of a procession winding its way through through Wootton Bassett. It is astonishing to think how far the coal industry has fallen in just 40 years. The 1974 general election is remembered in Maltby chiefly for when Edward Heath asked the question: \"Who governs Britain?\", with the voters responding, \"Clearly not you!\" The incoming Labour government rapidly settled the second national coal dispute in as many years with the new energy secretary, a miners-sponsored MP, Eric Varley telling Labour's National Executive Committee: \"King Coal is back on his throne again. He is firmly established on it. No one can knock him off. The only way he can lose is by abdication.\" Varley was referring to the industry and most likely to the leadership of the NUM at that time \u2013 Joe Gormley and his gravelly voiced communist deputy, Mick McGahey. But if there was ever a human personification of King Coal, that must surely have been the late Alf Robens, chairman of the National Coal Board (NCB), whose Daimler number plate famously bore the letters \"NCB 1\" and who shuttled around the coalfields in an executive plane. It was Robens who may have presided over the shrinking of the industry by half in the 1960s, but it was also Robens who offered up a now-heretical nostrum that Britain should restrict cheap coal imports because it undermined the heavy investment in the domestic industry and threatened the jobs of those who mined it. I first visited Maltby in 1982, where a friend's father was a face-worker in the colliery. This was before Margaret Thatcher coined the phrase \"the enemy within\" to describe miners who went on strike to halt her planned ideological assault on the industry. Maltby then was much as it is now, with its allotments, pigeon lofts and friendly banter. The street names next to the Miners Welfare Club are named after a succession of Labour leaders: Lansbury Grove, Attlee Close, Gaitskell Close and Hardie Close. Britain's last remaining miners became industrial travellers over the past 15 years, moving from pit to pit as they shut. I meet Clare with her daughters at the Maltby march. Her husband has worked at a succession of local mines, and now commutes to one of the last remaining ones, Hatfield Main. \"He wanted to be here today, but they wouldn't let him,\" she says, as we head with banners flying to the welfare club. Sadly, the years of defeat had led finally to major recriminations among the dwindling membership of the once mighty NUM, whose battalions, Harold MacMillan once declared, should, like \"Eton and the Guards\", never be provoked. Steve Mace, a local official at Maltby, speaks darkly of impending battles with \"the national leadership\". That national leadership, in the shape of Chris Kitchen, recently saw off former NUM president Arthur Scargill in the courts over a bitter row involving his occupancy of a flat owned by the union in the Barbican. Inside the Welfare Hall, a middle-aged couple are doing a brisk trade in commemorative coasters that read: \"Keep calm, Maltby and carry on!\" while the union banners are laid against the wall. The place is heaving, as queues snake inside to reach the bars. Outside, children play in Hardie Close in the first of the very late spring sunshine. In the distance, set back against a grey mountain of coal waste a century in the making, stands Maltby's monumental winding gear, silent and brooding. \u2022 The subheading on this article was amended on 19 April 2013. The original said 40% of the UK's energy needs were met by coal. That has been corrected to 40% of electricity needs.",

      "body": "<p>Nothing better symbolised the passing of a great industry, referred to reverentially as \"King Coal\", than the lowering of one of the last chunks to have been cut at Maltby colliery next to the grave of the \"unknown miner\" in the town's cemetery last weekend. His had been the only body to be recovered when a gas explosion ripped through the underground galleries 90 years ago, killing 27 men. Those present wiped away tears, as last rites on an industry that had sustained this community for more than a century were read by the local priest. Wreaths were laid and the colliery brass band played the miners' hymn, Gresford, itself an anthem <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2009/sep/24/gresford-disaster-archive\" title=\"\">to another disaster.</a> The short service had been billed as a \"thanksgiving and prayer for the future\", although the many newly redundant must have wondered what future there could be in an area where good jobs are scarce. Strangely, the closure of Maltby came days before Margaret Thatcher, widely seen as the butcher of the coal industry, passed away.</p> <p>This South Yorkshire town was built on coal, and thanks to Maltby's huge reserves of \"black gold\", locals had held out some hope that despite the many closures that have hit the area over the past 30 years, they might just wash past the mine with its 540 or so employees. At its height, Maltby cut more than a million tonnes of coal each year \u2013 most of it going on the \"merry-go-round\" railway wagons to Drax power station, with the rest heading for the Monckton coke works near Barnsley.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, in Worksop, north Nottinghamshire, the shopkeeper at a local bric-a-brac shop tells me that, although the local mines had closed in the late 1980s and early 90s, the area was still scarred by heavy unemployment. (They barely even burn coal around here any more: I ask him if he might know a coal merchant I could talk to. \"You would be hard placed to find a local coal merchant around here,\" he replies.)</p> <p>In today's Britain, the roll call of Yorkshire villages that once made nightly news in the early 80s as near civil war gripped the coalfields \u2013 places such as Dinnington, Thurcroft, Rossington, Wath, Armthorpe and Grimethorpe \u2013 have quietly slid away from public consciousness.</p> <p>In the last 15 years, international coal prices have been buoyant, Britain's remaining privately operated deep mines becoming more productive and profitable, with a couple<strong>, </strong>including Hatfield Main in Ed Miliband's Doncaster constituency and the Unity Mine in South Wales even being reopened. The price of coal increased from around $30 per short ton in 2000 to around $150 per short ton in September 2008. But as of October 2008, the price per short ton had declined to $111.50. Prices further declined to $71.25, as of October 2010.</p> <p>Even as this long winter extended its grip, over 40% of Britain's electricity needs have been met by coal \u2013 the bulk of it now imported. But earlier this year came news that work on a new seam at Maltby had had to be suspended, because of unusually high levels of gas, and the pit was to be shut. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2013/feb/25/warwickshire-mine-threat-huge-underground-fire\" title=\"\">On top of a disastrous fire at Europe's biggest producing mine at Daw Mill in Warwickshire</a> and the mothballing \u2013 closure with the option of reopening later \u2013 in January of Aberpergwm drift mine in South Wales, this means that there are only three remaining deep mines left in operation in Britain. These are Hatfield and Kellingley in Yorkshire, and Thorseby in Nottinghamshire. Another Notts pit, Harworth, is currently mothballed. This means we are on the verge of losing both an irreplaceable skills base and, potentially, access to all the remaining coal. And this in a country now virtually dependent on gas and oil supplies from elsewhere; Britain was recently awaiting a gas supply ship from Qatar, after being days away from running out of supplies altogether.</p> <p>Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), explains: \"We are going to be beholden to other countries and suffer the consequences. Once upon a time profitable pits helped ones that weren't making profits because they were developing new coal faces. Now there is no slack.\" Those close to the industry speak bitterly about missed opportunities. Last year, the government turned its back on investing in a new combined heat and power plant, planned to be built next door to Hatfield colliery. EU Commission officials said the now-scrapped power station would have been 'the most advanced of its type in Europe'. Kitchen says: \"For just a minuscule amount of the money wasted on the banks, thousands of jobs could have been created in cutting-edge energy production in South Yorkshire and Britain might have been ahead of the curve when it came to 'clean coal technology' and carbon capture.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-407512308\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/4/10/1365617468031/Hatfield-Colliery-in-2006-010.jpg\" alt=\"Hatfield Colliery in 2006 \u2026  a new 'clean' power station in the area was abandoned.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hatfield Colliery in 2006 \u2026  a new 'clean' power station in the area was abandoned. Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The arguments may be old, but they are still relevant. One ex-miner, Mick (not his real name), still employed by Maltby's operating company, Hargreaves, says: \"They've shut it, because coal prices have dipped. We all know that there are millions of tonnes of the stuff down there.\" Standing at the entrance to the pit, as the procession prepares to get under way, Kevin Barron, the area's MP, agrees. \"We have seen far too many of these closures. Let's see where we are in 50 years' time when we really need these sources of energy,\" he says. Barron helped lead the charge for his old workplace when Michael Heseltine reeled off a list of planned closures in 1992, moving seamlessly in a Commons statement from \"Maltby\" to sonorously intone: \"Point of Ayr in Scotland\". Point of Ayr was, in fact, in North Wales. In response, a bunch of Frickley miners, also from the militant Yorkshire coalfield, headed south in retribution to Heseltine's country pile in Oxfordshire and blocked his gates with a lorryload of coal. Later, some of them dug up part of his front lawn, claiming to have located a large seam of coal running beneath. Maltby was reprieved back then, and it was so successful until recently that it hired 70 young apprentices. As Mick notes: \"Many of the men had genuinely thought they would see out their working lives here.\"</p> <p>Back at the parade in the town centre,<strong> </strong>the colliery band and the NUM banners lead a long procession cheered on by Saturday shoppers, perhaps remembering fathers or grandfathers, for most in Maltby will have had some connection with the industry. The final sendoff to more than 100 years of mining in the area has the feel of a procession winding its way through through Wootton Bassett.</p> <p>It is astonishing to think how far the coal industry has fallen in just 40 years. The 1974 general election is remembered in Maltby chiefly for when Edward Heath asked the question: \"Who governs Britain?\", with the voters responding, \"Clearly not you!\" The incoming Labour government rapidly settled the second national coal dispute in as many years with the new energy secretary, a miners-sponsored MP, Eric Varley telling Labour's National Executive Committee: \"King Coal is back on his throne again. He is firmly established on it. No one can knock him off. The only way he can lose is by abdication.\"</p> <p>Varley was referring to the industry and most likely to the leadership of the NUM at that time \u2013 Joe Gormley and his gravelly voiced communist deputy, Mick McGahey. But if there was ever a human personification of King Coal, that must surely have been the late Alf Robens, chairman of the National Coal Board (NCB), whose Daimler number plate famously bore the letters \"NCB 1\" and who shuttled around the coalfields in an executive plane. It was Robens who may have presided over the shrinking of the industry by half in the 1960s, but it was also Robens who offered up a now-heretical nostrum that Britain should restrict cheap coal imports because it undermined the heavy investment in the domestic industry and threatened the jobs of those who mined it.</p> <p>I first visited Maltby in 1982, where a friend's father was a face-worker in the colliery. This was before Margaret Thatcher coined the phrase \"the enemy within\" to describe miners who went on strike to halt her planned ideological assault on the industry. Maltby then was much as it is now, with its allotments, pigeon lofts and friendly banter. The street names next to the Miners Welfare Club are named after a succession of Labour leaders: Lansbury Grove, Attlee Close, Gaitskell Close and Hardie Close.</p> <p>Britain's last remaining miners became industrial travellers over the past 15 years, moving from pit to pit as they shut. I meet Clare with her daughters at the Maltby march. Her husband has worked at a succession of local mines, and now commutes to one of the last remaining ones, Hatfield Main. \"He wanted to be here today, but they wouldn't let him,\" she says, as we head with banners flying to the welfare club.</p> <p>Sadly, the years of defeat had led finally to major recriminations among the dwindling membership of the once mighty NUM, whose battalions, Harold MacMillan once declared, should, like \"Eton and the Guards\", never be provoked. Steve Mace, a local official at Maltby, speaks darkly of impending battles with \"the national leadership\". That national leadership, in the shape of Chris Kitchen, recently saw off former NUM president Arthur Scargill in the courts over a bitter row involving his occupancy of a flat owned by the union in the Barbican.</p> <p>Inside the Welfare Hall, a middle-aged couple are doing a brisk trade in commemorative coasters that read: \"Keep calm, Maltby and carry on!\" while the union banners are laid against the wall. The place is heaving, as queues snake inside to reach the bars. Outside, children play in Hardie Close in the first of the very late spring sunshine. In the distance, set back against a grey mountain of coal waste a century in the making, stands Maltby's monumental winding gear, silent and brooding.</p> <p>\u2022 The subheading on this article was amended on 19 April 2013. The original said 40% of the UK's energy needs were met by coal. That has been corrected to 40% of electricity needs.</p>",
