      "bodyText": "Sales of dry sherry have soared by a quarter, popularised by the growing number of tapas restaurants and sherry bars, according to Majestic Wine. The revival in demand for drier, premium, varieties such as fino and manzanilla this year is thought to have arrested a long-term decline in sales of the fortified wine caused by the dwindling popularity of cream and sweet sherries such as Harveys Bristol Cream and Croft Original. \u201cIt\u2019s the dry, more elegant, styles that are doing well,\u201d said Rowan Gormley, the chief executive of Majestic Wine. \u201cIt\u2019s driven by the hipster generation.\u201d Dry sherries are also being used as a base for cocktails, from the classic Rebujito to modern inventions involving padr\u00f3n peppers or tonic water. Overall sales of sherry fell to 10m bottles in the UK in 2015, less than half the 22m sold in 2005, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA). That was driven by the ebbing popularity of cream and sweet sherries as generations used to supping a glass or two before dinner pass away. The trend comes as Brits are buying less wine, with the falling value of the pound driving up prices by an average 6%. Gormley said he believed about 4% fewer bottles of wine were bought in the UK this year, but that shoppers were seeking out more interesting tipples that offered better value for money. He said sales of wines from small-scale producers were growing in popularity amid the interest in artisan producers, which has already gripped the beer and spirits markets. \u201cIn a market where many of our competitors have gone bust, there\u2019s a choice to pick up a bottle of wine off the shelf in a supermarket and take pot luck with a pretty label or a discount, or to go into Majestic and get some advice.\u201d Sales rose 8.9% at the group\u2019s fine wine specialist Lay &amp; Wheeler. Separately, the Majestic Wine chain increased sales by 2.3% in the six months to 2 October, which Gormley said was ahead of the wider market. Total group sales rose 4.2% and the company bounced back from a loss of \u00a34.4m to a profit of \u00a33.1m as it cut marketing costs for its Naked Wines online division, which achieved strong growth in the US.",

      "bodyText": "Shoppers are expected to go on a \u00a32.5bn spending spree in the next 24 hours as Black Friday discount fever sweeps UK high streets. Friday promises to be a nailbiting one for retailers who see the US inspired discount day as a litmus test ahead of the key Christmas trading period. The high-street clothing bellwether Next, which traditionally refuses to offer pre-Christmas discounts, is entering the Black Friday fray for the first time to boost flagging sales amid a blizzard of promotions from rivals, including John Lewis and Debenhams. \u201cOn balance we think that the power has swung back in favour of shoppers this year and we expect record online purchases over the next few days,\u201d said Keith Richardson, managing director of the retail sector at Lloyds\u2019 commercial banking. Black Friday comes amid mixed signals from the high street. This week the Multiyork Furniture chain called in administrators, while on Thursday Mothercare issued a profit warning that wiped nearly 20% off the value of its shares. Yet the CBI\u2019s monthly survey of retail activity suggested high-street sales had staged a recovery in November, despite the steepest growth in selling prices in almost 25 years. \u201cOur high streets are not out of the woods,\u201d said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI. \u201cAhead of the crucial run-up to Christmas, the weaker pound has pushed up prices and retailers are nervous about business conditions and are trimming their workforces.\u201d British households are facing the biggest squeeze on living standards since records began, according to the Resolution Foundation, amid rising inflation due to the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote. Many consumers struggling with shrinking disposable income will have held back on spending in September and October to buy not just Christmas presents but essentials. Household gadgets such as coffee machines and food mixers are expected to be big sellers alongside the toys, games consoles and Fitbits destined for under the Christmas tree, as Britons scour the internet for the best deals. \u201cBoth retailers and consumers are more savvy about Black Friday than they were a few years ago,\u201d added Richardson. \u201cStores know better than to give away massive discounts on items consumers were going to buy anyway ... shoppers, meanwhile, are better at spotting the worthwhile deals.\u201d Mark Newton-Jones, head of Mothercare, said British shoppers had gone \u201cquiet\u201d in recent weeks; Mothercare had had a sharp drop in customer numbers and sales. His comments came as the group fell deeper into the red, reporting a pre-tax loss of \u00a316.8m for the six months to 7 October. The results were dragged down by weakness in the company\u2019s international business despite it spending heavily to revive sales at its UK stores amid stiff competition. Richard Hyman, an independent retail consultant, described Next\u2019s decision to get involved in Black Friday as a big surprise given that discounting only increased pressure on retailers\u2019 profit margins. \u201cIt has taken [Next] years of sitting on the sidelines to make up its mind to join the fray,\u201d said Hyman. \u201cI suspect this is more to do with wanting to boost flagging sales than a sudden liking for the lemming-like melee that is Black Friday.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK faces two decades of no earnings growth and more austerity, says IFS", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading financial thinktank has warned workers to expect an unprecedented two lost decades of earnings growth and many more years of austerity as a result of the marked slowdown in the economy announced in Philip Hammond\u2019s budget. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said in its traditional post-budget analysis that forecasts slashing productivity, earnings and growth in every year until 2022 made \u201cpretty grim reading\u201d, and predicted that even by the middle of the next decade, Britain\u2019s public finances would still be in the red. The Treasury said the reforms and investment announced by the chancellor were designed to build a country \u201cfit for the future\u201d, but opposition parties said the gloomy IFS report undermined the chancellor\u2019s claims. In its analysis of the budget and the report from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the IFS said: GDP per person will be 3.5% smaller in 2021 than forecast in March 2016. The loss of growth will mean the economy is \u00a365bn smaller in 2021 than previously thought. Average earnings are on course to be \u00a31,400 a year lower in 2021 than forecast in 2016. That means the recovery in wages will have failed to materialise and average earnings will be below their 2008 level adjusted for inflation. Borrowing will be \u00a312bn higher in 2021 than was forecast in March. Despite a spending increase over the next five years, the NHS is facing its tightest funding constraints since the 1980s. Annual spending growth of 4% a year after inflation before the financial crisis has fallen to 1% a year at a time when the NHS is being stretched by an expanding and ageing population. Paul Johnson, the IFS director, said the OBR\u2019s decision to reduce its growth forecasts by one-quarter over the next five years would delay deficit reduction, limit Hammond\u2019s ability to ease pressure on welfare and public services and harm living standards. \u201cWe are in danger of losing not just one but getting on for two decades of earnings growth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will all have to get used to the idea that steadily rising living standards may be a thing of the increasingly distant past.\u201d The nascent recovery in earnings, which were growing through 2014 to the first half of 2016, had been choked off, Johnson said. \u201cThat they might still be below their 2008 level in 2022 as the OBR forecasts is truly astonishing. Let\u2019s hope this forecast turns out to be too pessimistic,\u201d he added. John McDonnell said the IFS analysis \u201cexposed the appalling failure of seven years of this government\u2019s austerity economics and its grim consequences for working people\u201d. \u201cSeven years of austerity has not only blighted lives and plunged our public services into crisis, it has also trashed productivity growth and dragged down living standards,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. \u201cThis is a government and an economic policy that has completely failed by any conventional standard; they can serve no further purpose in office.\u201d The Liberal Democrats said the chancellor was bringing down the public spending deficit by \u201cbalancing the books on the backs of the poorest\u201d. Although Hammond announced extra money for the NHS and scrapped stamp duty for first-time housebuyers in his budget, the package was overshadowed by the OBR\u2019s announcement that the economy would never recover from the damage caused by the financial crisis and its aftermath. It put long-term productivity growth at 1%, down from 2% before the crash. A Treasury spokesman said an increase in the \u201cnational living wage\u201d would be worth an extra \u00a3600 a year to low-income workers, while freezing fuel duty for the eighth year in a row and raising the income tax personal threshold would support hard-pressed families. \u201cThe only way to improve living standards in the long term is to improve our productivity, which is why we are investing \u00a330bn across the country in new infrastructure and skills, and delivering an ambitious industrial strategy,\u201d he said. Johnson said that despite the extra cash for the NHS, the government\u2019s main austerity plans were still in place. \u201cThis is not the end of austerity. It is not even nearly the end of austerity. There are still nearly \u00a312bn of welfare cuts to work through the system, while day-to-day public services spending is still due to be 3.6% lower in 2022-23 than it is today,\u201d he said. Hammond appeared to have satisfied his Conservative colleagues by avoiding politically controversial measures that then have to be unpicked, as in March, when his planned increase in national insurance contributions for self-employed people was ditched within a week. One senior Tory said: \u201cIt seems fine. It\u2019s not unravelled, which is a win at the moment. We plough on.\u201d The chancellor held scores of face-to-face meetings with Tory MPs in the run-up to the budget on Wednesday, to allow them to voice their concerns, and was well-received at the 1922 Committee of backbenchers afterwards. The former permanent secretary to the Treasury, Nick Macpherson, said: \u201cThere are some perfectly sensible policies in this budget. The sad thing is they will have very little impact because they are so small. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly reasonable political choice \u2013 you\u2019ve got to fill up a budget speech, and there\u2019s always that choice between one big measure and spreading your largesse rather more thinly, and that is what the chancellor has done. It makes perfect sense in political terms, perhaps less sense in economic terms.\u201d Macpherson, who ran the Treasury until last year, added that abolishing stamp duty was best understood as a sweetener for Conservative voters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get too hung up on the impact on transactions and first-time buyers: this is a relieving tax on the government\u2019s core supporters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast majority of young people can\u2019t afford to buy any house and probably won\u2019t for many years to come, but the proportion of the population who can \u2013 no doubt with the help of their parents \u2013 stump up the odd \u00a3250,000-300,000, is the sweet spot of Tory middle England. So people who claim it\u2019s bad value for money get it slightly wrong. It\u2019s all about shoring up political support.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s leading financial thinktank has warned workers to expect an unprecedented two lost decades of earnings growth and many more years of austerity as a result of the marked slowdown in the economy announced in Philip Hammond\u2019s budget.</p> \n<p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies said in its traditional post-budget analysis that forecasts slashing productivity, earnings and growth in every year until 2022 made \u201cpretty grim reading\u201d, and predicted that even by the middle of the next decade, Britain\u2019s public finances would still be in the red.</p> \n<p>The Treasury said the reforms and investment announced by the chancellor were designed to build a country \u201cfit for the future\u201d, but opposition parties said the gloomy IFS report undermined the chancellor\u2019s claims.</p> \n<p>In its analysis of the budget and the report from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the IFS said:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>GDP per person will be 3.5% smaller in 2021 than forecast in March 2016. The loss of growth will mean the economy is \u00a365bn smaller in 2021 than previously thought.</li> \n <li>Average earnings are on course to be \u00a31,400 a year lower in 2021 than forecast in 2016. That means the recovery in wages will have failed to materialise and average earnings will be below their 2008 level adjusted for inflation.</li> \n <li>Borrowing will be \u00a312bn higher in 2021 than was forecast in March.</li> \n <li>Despite a spending increase over the next five years, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/public-services-face-real-terms-spending-cuts-of-up-to-40-in-decade-to-2020\">NHS is facing its tightest funding constraints</a> since the 1980s.

Let\u2019s hope this forecast turns out to be too pessimistic,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>John McDonnell said the IFS analysis \u201cexposed the appalling failure of seven years of this government\u2019s austerity economics and its grim consequences for working people\u201d. </p> \n<p>\u201cSeven years of austerity has not only blighted lives and plunged our public services into crisis, it has also trashed productivity growth and dragged down living standards,\u201d the shadow chancellor said. </p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a government and an economic policy that has completely failed by any conventional standard; they can serve no further purpose in office.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Liberal Democrats said the chancellor was bringing down the public spending deficit by \u201cbalancing the books on the backs of the poorest\u201d.</p> \n<p>Although Hammond announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/budgets-16bn-cash-boost-for-nhs-less-than-half-of-experts-advice\">extra money for the NHS</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/23/philip-hammond-stamp-duty-axe-is-incentive-to-save-house-deposit\">scrapped stamp duty</a> for first-time housebuyers in his budget, the package was overshadowed by the OBR\u2019s announcement that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/23/uk-fall-living-standards-resolution-foundation-budget\">economy would never recover</a> from the damage caused by the financial crisis and its aftermath. It put long-term productivity growth at 1%, down from 2% before the crash.</p> \n<p>A Treasury spokesman said an increase in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/oct/12/national-living-wage-has-caused-biggest-fall-in-low-pay-since-70s-says-thinktank\">\u201cnational living wage\u201d</a> would be worth an extra \u00a3600 a year to low-income workers, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/nov/22/treasury-backs-electric-cars-but-makes-limited-moves-on-diesel\">freezing fuel duty</a> for the eighth year in a row and raising the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/23/higher-rate-uk-taxpayers-gain-most-in-budget-changes\">income tax personal threshold</a> would support hard-pressed families.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only way to improve living standards in the long term is to improve our productivity, which is why we are investing \u00a330bn across the country in new infrastructure and skills, and delivering an ambitious industrial strategy,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f7ad0a18-de29-4f4f-9968-cc131fa91abf\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Productivity is an economic measure of the efficiency of a workforce.

There are still nearly \u00a312bn of welfare cuts to work through the system, while day-to-day public services spending is still due to be 3.6% lower in 2022-23 than it is today,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Hammond appeared to have satisfied his Conservative colleagues by avoiding politically controversial measures that then have to be unpicked, as in March, when his planned increase in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/08/self-employed-national-insurance-budget-ni-tax-benefits\">national insurance contributions</a> for self-employed people was ditched within a week. One senior Tory said: \u201cIt seems fine. It\u2019s not unravelled, which is a win at the moment. We plough on.\u201d </p> \n<p>The chancellor held scores of face-to-face meetings with Tory MPs in the run-up to the budget on Wednesday, to allow them to voice their concerns, and was well-received at the 1922 Committee of backbenchers afterwards.</p> \n<p>The former permanent secretary to the Treasury, Nick Macpherson, said: \u201cThere are some perfectly sensible policies in this budget. The sad thing is they will have very little impact because they are so small.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly reasonable political choice \u2013 you\u2019ve got to fill up a budget speech, and there\u2019s always that choice between one big measure and spreading your largesse rather more thinly, and that is what the chancellor has done. It makes perfect sense in political terms, perhaps less sense in economic terms.\u201d</p> \n<p>Macpherson, who ran the Treasury <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/04/treasury-permanent-secretary-sir-nicholas-macpherson-step-down\">until last year</a>, added that abolishing stamp duty was best understood as a sweetener for Conservative voters. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get too hung up on the impact on transactions and first-time buyers: this is a relieving tax on the government\u2019s core supporters,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe vast majority of young people can\u2019t afford to buy any house and probably won\u2019t for many years to come, but the proportion of the population who can \u2013 no doubt with the help of their parents \u2013 stump up the odd \u00a3250,000-300,000, is the sweet spot of Tory middle England. So people who claim it\u2019s bad value for money get it slightly wrong. It\u2019s all about shoring up political support.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Seven years after George Osborne ushered in a tough new age of spending cuts and deficit reduction, the Institute for Fiscal Studies had a grim message for the long-suffering British public yesterday: the age of austerity is not over. The IFS is to the budget what the pundits are to Match of the Day. It pores over the highlights, dissects why things have gone wrong (and more rarely why they have gone right), and takes delight in telling it the way it is. On this occasion, the IFS had plenty to analyse. There was some praise for Philip Hammond for raising public infrastructure spending and the thinktank was kinder than most about the chancellor\u2019s decision to abolish stamp duty for most first-time buyers. But other than that, it was all grim news. Although Britain is suffering from austerity fatigue, the IFS said the nation had not even reached half time in the struggle to put the public finances back in the black. Paul Johnson, the IFS\u2019s director, said he found it hard to imagine the deficit being eradicated by the mid-2020s, which is what the government hopes to do. Less than two years ago, Osborne was confidently predicting that he would be presiding over a \u00a310bn budget surplus in the year running up to what was then expected to be a 2020 general election. A savage cut to Britain\u2019s growth rate, coupled with some giveaways from Hammond, means that the UK is now forecast to run a deficit of \u00a335bn in 2019-20. The figures for borrowing would be \u00a35bn-6bn a year higher had it not been for changes which take some spending off the government\u2019s books. By 2022-23, borrowing will still be \u00a325bn and that assumes a tightening of the purse strings which the IFS deems unlikely. Johnson said: \u201cAs the OBR notes, there is an Augustinian tinge to these plans: \u201cLord make me pure, but not yet\u201d.\u201d All the extra borrowing to balance the books over the past decade has meant the national debt has more than doubled to 86% of national income. The debt ratio was even higher after the second world war but rapid growth meant it came down quickly. This time, the process is going to be much slower. Assuming that the OBR is right in its assessment that the trend rate of productivity growth is around 1%, it will take until the 2060s to get national debt back below 40% of GDP. The postwar period was a time of rising real incomes and higher public spending. By contrast, over the next five years, the IFS says that spending on public services excluding the NHS will fall by 7%, while the \u00a3300m allocated to universal credit will only make a dent in the planned \u00a312bn to be axed from working age benefits. The IFS also questioned whether, even after Hammond\u2019s cash injection, the settlement for health was all that generous, noting that once the ageing of the baby boomer generation is taken into account, there will be no increase in spending per head between now and the early 2020s. Johnson said the government would be forced to soften its approach to public spending. \u201cThe last few years have been marked by constant (small) upgrades to implausibly tight spending plans to avoid problems in prisons, social care and now health,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will almost inevitably be more such top-ups in the years ahead.\u201d But despite the bad news on the deficit, the national debt and public spending, the thinktank saved its real gloom for its forecasts for earnings. When adjusted for inflation, the IFS noted that average (median) earnings fell by more than \u00a32,000 a year to just over \u00a322,000 in the five years after the start of the financial crisis. A recovery then began and, had earnings continued to grow at the rate seen between 2014 and the first half of 2016, they would have clawed their way back to their pre-crisis level by 2020-21. But, as Johnson noted, that process has been choked off and even by 2022-23 real earnings will still be around \u00a3750 a year below where they were in 2007-08. Unless the economy performs better than expected, the IFS now thinks Britain is in danger of losing not just one, but getting on for two decades of earnings growth. This would be the equivalent of earnings being lower when John Major left Downing Street in 1997 than when Margaret Thatcher began 18 years of Conservative rule in 1979. Historically, it is without precedent. As the IFS notes, everything depends on whether the OBR has got its forecasts right. Were the economy to grow by 2% a year, rather than 1% a year, the national debt would fall more quickly, the budget would be balanced by the middle of the next decade and earnings growth would pick up. When measured by growth in incomes per head over the coming half-decade, Britain is expected to hold up the G7 league table. A better productivity performance of the sort Hammond says his supply-side policies will deliver would change that. But, as the IFS noted, the OBR\u2019s forecast for productivity growth in the years ahead is at around 1% a year, well above the post-crisis average of 0.3% a year. Johnson said it was hard to argue that the OBR\u2019s judgement was overly pessimistic. The fear is that it might prove too optimistic.",

Were the economy to grow by 2% a year, rather than 1% a year, the national debt would fall more quickly, the budget would be balanced by the middle of the next decade and earnings growth would pick up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2017-11-23T18:08:58/embed.html\" data-alt=\"The OBR expects the UK to perform worse than its G7 competitors\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/nov/2017-11-23T18:08:58/embed.html\">The OBR expects the UK to perform worse than its G7 competitors</a> </figure>  <p>When measured by growth in incomes per head over the coming half-decade, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/31/uk-comes-bottom-of-the-g7-growth-league-as-canada-takes-the-lead\">Britain is expected to hold up the G7 league table</a>.

      "bodyText": "Ryanair cabin crew have been told they could face \u201cdisciplinary proceedings\u201d and have their working hours forcibly changed unless they sell more perfume and scratchcards. The Irish airline has previously denied pressuring staff to hit specific sales targets, after it emerged they were encouraged to sell products in return for bonuses. But letters sent to crew members by recruitment firms that supply staff to Ryanair \u2013 seen by the Guardian \u2013 warn of dire consequences for those whose average sales per flight fall \u201cbelow budget\u201d. The letters highlight 10 products, including drinks, confectionery, cosmetics and scratchcards, listing the percentage of flights in which individual cabin crew members had not sold enough. Cabin crew were also criticised for too often failing to sell more than \u20ac50 (\u00a345) of merchandise, indicating a fixed sales target. The letters, one from recruitment agency WorkForce International Contractors and another from an agency that cannot be named because it could not be reached for comment, feature almost identical wording. \u201cThis performance is not acceptable and it is clear that you are simply not doing your job on board,\u201d the letters state, warning crew members they had \u201cdrastically underperformed\u201d. Crew members were also told that their sales were being \u201cclosely monitored\u201d and that if they did not sell more goods \u201cfurther action will be taken and you may be subject to disciplinary proceedings\u201d. Ryanair\u2019s operational manual for cabin crew states that their function is \u201cprimarily for the safety of passengers\u201d. Earlier this year the airline denied putting any \u201cpressure\u201d on staff to make sales after a separate memo was leaked instructing cabin crew to sell a fixed number of meals, drinks and scratchcards or explain why they had not. But as well as the threat of \u201cdisciplinary proceedings\u201d, the new letters show that crew were told that Ryanair could force staff who don\u2019t hit targets to plug staffing gaps at short notice, rather than enjoying fixed working hours. In 2015, Ryanair agreed a new pay and rostering deal with agency staff, under which they work for five days and have three days off. But cabin crew were told Ryanair had \u201cno obligation\u201d to provide this roster if sales targets were not met and that, as of next month, they could be called to work at arbitrary times on a weekly basis. \u201cOur client airline [Ryanair] will continue to offer favorable [sic] conditions including pay and roster agreements to our cabin crew, however this can only apply to those crew who contribute,\u201d the letters said. The fixed rostering pattern would be restored if crew members increased their sales performance, crew were told, but not until next year. The Irish trade union Impact, which was shown a copy of one letter, said: \u201cIt makes for grim reading. \u201cThe primary role of cabin crew is flight safety, in-flight sales is a secondary role. \u201cThis correspondence suggests a crude approach to performance management, and reveals the vulnerability of individual staff if they don\u2019t reach the targets they\u2019ve been set. \u201cThe client airline\u2019s position on organised labour is well documented, so I\u2019m struck by the fact, more than anything else, that this person had nobody to turn to when they received that letter.\u201d The sale of food, drink, perfume and other items such as scratchcards is a major part of Ryanair\u2019s income, providing \u00a31.5bn in \u201cancillary revenue\u201d last year. The figure makes up 27% of the airline\u2019s total revenue and it said last year that it wants to raise that proportion to 30%. Ryanair said it had not seen the memo but added: \u201cWhile we cannot comment in detail on the WorkForce letter, it clearly does not set any \u2018targets\u2019 which must be met. \u201cAs the letter makes clear, any individual, who consistently, and markedly, underperforms, may face disciplinary proceedings \u2018if there is no significant and sustained improvement.\u2019 \u201cWe expect underperformers to improve, and they are given time and training to do so. What does the Guardian do with its underperformers?\u201d WorkForce did not return requests for comment. Members of a private Facebook group for Ryanair cabin crew, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, expressed their dismay at the tone of the letter. One branded the carrier a \u201cbunch of bullies\u201d while another described the difficulty that cabin crew face in improving their working conditions. \u201cThey don\u2019t care if you leave the company, for each one of us leaving they can replace with 20 new young guys coming from school and working as they want.\u201d Ryanair\u2019s employment practices have come under increasing scrutiny of late amid a row with pilots that erupted following mass cancellations caused by the company\u2019s failure to roster its staff properly. The dispute saw pilots form an unofficial trade union in a battle with the chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary over their employment terms. It has also emerged that Ryanair pilots are being investigated by HM Revenue &amp; Customs over complex employment structures imposed on them by the no-frills airline.",

The gap between what male and female Bank workers earn \u2013 based on median hourly earnings \u2013 was 24.2% as at 30 March. For bonuses paid in the year to March, the gap was 25.6%. Bonuses are paid to employees at all levels, excluding the governor, Mark Carney, and his deputies, where performance objectives have been met. Carney said the Bank\u2019s gender pay gap was created because there were more men than women in the top jobs at Threadneedle Street. \u201cWe\u2019re confident that men and women are paid equally for doing the same job at the Bank; however, the greater proportion of men than women in senior roles creates a gender pay gap,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe are working hard to address this imbalance through inclusive and diverse recruitment, including diverse shortlists and interview panels, offering flexible working, providing continual unconscious bias training, and fostering an inclusive culture. Addressing the disparity in gender representation at senior levels will take time, but it will help close the current gender pay gap at the Bank.\u201d The latest official figures show Britain\u2019s gender pay gap fell to 9.1% in April, from 9.4% a year earlier, taking it to the lowest level since records began 20 years ago. It was 17.4% in 1997, when the Office for National Statistics first collected the data. The pay gap in the broader financial services sector is sharply higher than the national average, at above 30%. Last month, MPs on the Treasury select committee said they were concerned about a lack of diversity among the Bank\u2019s most senior staff. Of the nine members of the Bank\u2019s interest-rate setting Monetary Policy Committee, for example, only one is a woman. Responding to the Bank\u2019s pay gap report, Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee, said more progress was needed. \u201cThe Bank\u2019s measures to address its pay gap seem to be on the right track, but we cannot be complacent. Any gap is still too great.\u201d By April next year, all UK firms and public sector organisations with 250 or more employees will have to report the gap between what they pay their male and female staff. Morgan said the Treasury committee would be monitoring the matter closely as part of its women in finance inquiry. \u201cWe may call for organisations to give evidence to the committee to hear about best practice.

      "bodyText": "Just Eat is on course to enter the FTSE 100 after its stock market value rose higher than Sainsbury\u2019s. The takeaway website has soared in value since making its stock market debut in 2014, with the company now worth \u00a35.6bn after gobbling up smaller rivals including Hungryhouse and SkipTheDishes. Steve Clayton, the head of equity funds at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cTwenty years ago it was all about going out to a restaurant, but now it is all about the meal coming to the home. \u201cWe are all carrying digital devices in our pockets and Just Eat moved first to connect independents to the dining public.\u201d The FTSE 100 and 250 indices are reviewed on a quarterly basis, with the reshuffles highlighting the waxing and waning of company fortunes. Tough trading conditions in the retail sector mean some of the lowest rungs of the FTSE 100 areoccupied by major high street names including M&amp;S, Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons. All three food retailers have a lower market capitalisation than Just Eat, whose shares have gone up 40% over the past year. It is on track to secure a place in Britain\u2019s top 100 companies when the quarterly review is published on Wednesday. The packaging company DS Smith and the engineering group Halma, which makes smoke detectors and other sensors, are also expected to make the grade. The reshuffle is expected to claim the scalp of Merlin Entertainments, the struggling leisure group behind Madame Tussauds, Alton Towers and Legoland. The company\u2019s shares have fallen nearly 17% in the past 12 months after holidaymakers shunned its attractions following terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. Babcock International, the engineering and outsourcing group, and the private hospitals group Mediclinic International are also staring at demotion to the FTSE 250. Just Eat is riding on the back of the restaurant delivery boom as more and more Britons avoid cooking evening meals. UK spending on takeaways reached \u00a39.9bn in 2016, a 34% increase on 2009, according to a recent report. The market\u2019s growth trend is expected to continue, with the takeaway economy tipped to be worth \u00a311.2bn in 2021. The company, which earns commission on restaurant orders placed via its website and apps, dominates the mass market end of the takeaway sector. Rivals such as Deliveroo concentrate on offering delivery services for more upmarket chains including Pizza Express and Gourmet Burger Kitchen. Just Eat provides the digital ordering service for its 78,700 restaurant partners, which then deliver the meals. Last month, the Just Eat chief executive, Peter Plumb, said sales had increased 47% to \u00a3138.6m in the three months to the end of September thanks to strong growth in order numbers and the inclusion of SkipTheDishes business. It handled 26.2m UK orders during the period. Further growth is on the cards after it received final clearance for the takeover of Hungryhouse last year following a lengthy investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. Babcock, which has lost nearly 30% of its value this year, has been dragged down by the woes of rival Carillion, which is fighting for survival due to the combination of a large debt pile and badly performing contracts, and defence spending cuts. Helal Miah, an analyst at The Share Centre, said Babcock had been in the \u201cdrop zone\u201d for several quarters: \u201cThe performance of the group over the last year has been disappointing on the back of concerns for support service providers, which was notably highlighted by the problems at Carillion,\u201d he said. \u201cConcerns remain over Babcock\u2019s growth targets for next year and continued pressure on the sector as a result of Brexit and contract delays.\u201d Mediclinic\u2019s share price is also down nearly 30% due to its exposure to South Africa\u2019s sluggish economy. The company is looking for deals but a \u00a31.3bn move on Spire Healthcare last month was rejected.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shares in British Gas\u2019s owner, Centrica, have had their their biggest fall in a single day after the company shed 823,000 customers in four months and warned earnings this year would be below expectations. The UK\u2019s biggest energy supplier said it lost nearly 6% of its customer accounts between July and October, with 150,000 of those heading for the door after the company raised prices for millions in September. The exodus leaves British Gas with 13.1m accounts, meaning it will still be the market leader even after its rival big six suppliers npower and SSE merge to create a company with 11.5m accounts. Shares in Centrica closed down more than 15% at 138p on Thursday, one-third below the price at which they were trading before Theresa May first raised the prospect of action on energy bills in October last year. The company\u2019s market value has reverted back to what it was 14 years ago. Centrica warned that its earnings per share for the year would be 12.5p, one-fifth below what the market had been expecting. Its operations in the UK and US were blamed for the shortfall. Profits at the company\u2019s North American units are expected to be down \u00a3140m for the full year, due to a one-off charge and \u201chighly competitive market conditions\u201d. Tough competition in the UK means Centrica will only break even, rather than making an expected profit of \u00a337m. The comparison site Energy Helpline said the exodus of customers was \u201chistoric\u201d and showed the company\u2019s electricity price rise had not gone unnoticed by households. Even the company\u2019s heavy focus on connected homes and devices such as smart thermostats appears to be off track. Centrica has 1.2m connected home products, which industry watchers said suggested a target of 1.5m sold by the end of the year will likely be missed. Revenue from the company\u2019s gas field in Morecambe Bay is also expected to be down due to production outages. Analysts said the trading statement was disappointing and warned the pressures the company faced were unlikely to go away next year. Experts at the investment bank Jefferies said: \u201c2017 is on track to be another tough year for Centrica. The negative trajectory in earnings would disappoint many.\u201d The Royal Bank of Canada called the performance \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d and said the scale of customer losses was alarming. Bernstein bank said the expected earnings called into question the way Centrica was being run, adding: \u201cIn our view, today\u2019s trading update has dealt a further blow to management credibility, reflected in the sharp price reaction.\u201d In recent years, Centrica has sold off many of its large power stations and oil and gas assets to concentrate on customer-facing businesses such as energy supply and services. Next year appears unlikely to offer a reprieve for the company. The prime minister\u2019s price cap on energy bills is due to take effect in late 2018 or early 2019 and new suppliers are still entering the market and undercutting British Gas on price. The spread betting company City Index said: \u201cThe bad news about the group\u2019s annual result is now in, but energy market pressures are unlikely to abate in 2018.\u201d Centrica conceded that the performance of some of its divisions was disappointing but defended the direction it was taking. Iain Conn, who was appointed chief executive in 2015, said: \u201cAlthough some aspects of our delivery in the second half of 2017 have been disappointing, I remain encouraged by our progress in implementing our strategy.\u201d Despite the expected weak earnings, Centrica said its dividend to shareholders this year was \u201cunderpinned\u201d and would be protected for a period of time during the company\u2019s transformation. \u201cWe would be willing to operate with dividend cover from earnings below historic levels,\u201d it said. Earlier this week, Conn said Centrica would scrap controversial standard variable tariffs for new customers from April 2018. The company also laid out its suggestions for how the UK energy market should be reformed, which included calling on ministers and the energy regulator, Ofgem, to phase out \u201cevergreen\u201d tariffs and shift clean power subsidies off energy bills on to general taxation.

The boss of Harrods, which is owned by Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, said \u00a3200m will be spent redeveloping all of the shop\u2019s one million sq ft of retail space over the next three years. The famous exterior with its 12,000 light bulbs and green awnings will be untouched. Michael Ward, who has been running Harrods for more than decade, said the refurbishment will be the most ambitious since the Knightsbridge store was opened by Charles Henry Harrod in 1849. Work has already begun on the redevelopment of its grade II-listed food halls, and its fine watch room and beauty halls will be increased in size. The watch room \u2013 where a Hublot spirit of big bang sapphire chronograph watch is on sale for \u00a366,000 and an 18 karat rose gold Audemars Piguet\u2019s Royal Oak Offshore watch is on sale for \u00a358,300 \u2013 will be expanded into the basement via a new marble staircase. Ward said much of the refurbishment work is being carried out to tailor the store to customers from China and south-east Asia. \u201cOur Hong Kong and Chinese customers are extremely important to Harrods so are considered part of our redevelopment plans,\u201d he said. \u201cFor us, the future is in the east and we have been focusing on that for a number of years.\u201d He said Chinese customers are Harrods\u2019 second-highest spenders after British shoppers, and research showed that one in every \u00a35 that Chinese visitors spend in London is spent at Harrods. \u201cMany of our Hong Kong customers have second homes in London and may have children at boarding schools in the UK,\u201d Ward said in an interview with the South China Morning Post. \u201cThey spend a significant amount of time in London and at Harrods so we don\u2019t see them as tourists, even if they do get to benefit from tax-free shopping.\u201d Last month Harrods reported its eighth consecutive year of rising profits, recording a 39% increase in pre-tax profit to \u00a3233m. Annual sales broke through the \u00a32bn mark for the first time ever, and the company noted a \u201csignificant boost in trade after the weakening of the British currency\u201d. The company paid out a \u00a3110m dividend to its owner Qatar Holding, the strategic investment division of the Qatar Investment Authority. The sovereign wealth fund bought Harrods from Mohamed Al Fayed for \u00a31.2bn in 2010. Official figures show the number of Chinese visitors to the UK in the first six months of the year rose by 47% to 115,000. These visitors spent a record \u00a3231m in the first half of the year, a 54% increase according to the Office for National Statistics during this period. Ward said that the department store, which has 330 different departments, is considering changes to its signage to make it easier for Chinese customers to navigate the shop. Harrods will also pump money into its boosting its presence on China\u2019s most popular social media platforms, Weibo and WeChat. Earlier this year, Harrods opened a branch of its famous tearoom in the British House in Beijing. The British House, which showcases more than 100 British brands, was set up by Highgrove China the exclusive Chinese agent for the Prince of Wales\u2019 social enterprises and a supporter of his charities.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap. A new report on Britain\u2019s economy has shown that firms reined in their investment over the summer. UK business investment growth more than halved in Q3 2017, to 0.2%, suggesting bosses were reluctant to invest for the future. The second estimate of UK GDP in July-September also found that household spending propped up growth, which was confirmed at 0.4%. A separate survey has shown that retail sales have picked up in November, as shoppers returned to the high street after an October slowdown. Yesterday\u2019s budget continues to be scrutinised, with the Institute of Fiscal Studies warning that the UK risks losing two decades of earnings growth. That\u2019s all for today, I think. Good night! GW A quiet day in the European markets has ended, with the FTSE 100 closing almost flat. France and Italy managed a small rally though. Financial firms and organisations with a large gender pay gap may have to explain it to MPs. Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury Committee, says there is no room for complacency, following the publication of the Bank of England\u2019s data today. She says: \u201cThe Bank\u2019s measures to address its pay gap seem to be on the right track, but we cannot be complacent. Any gap is still too great. \u201cAs part of our Women in Finance inquiry, we will keep a close eye on organisations as they report their gender pay gap before the April 2018 deadline. \u201cWe may call for organisations to give evidence to the Committee to hear about best practice. Financial firms should be prepared to explain any gender pay gap that they may have.\u201d Discouraging news from the UK labour market: There\u2019s no Wall Street open today; The US stock market is closed for the Thanksgiving celebrations, so traders will soon be tucking into the turkey with their nearest and dearest. That means tomorrow is Black Friday \u2013 America\u2019s traditional pilgrimage to the nearest mall to worship consumerism. European readers have probably noticed that Black Friday has become a bigger deal over here in recent years. Retailers have been offering deals for several days, with a flurry of new offers due at midnight. Press Association reports that some UK stores will opening early: Among them are some John Lewis stores that are slightly extending their opening hours, a \u201cfew\u201d Argos outlets opening early and 187 Tesco Extra stores that are closing at 1am and reopening at 5am on Black Friday, while a further 62 will open at 6am after preparing for the event. But not everyone is happy. Amazon workers in Italy are going on strike, in a row over bonuses.... Mihir Kapadia, CEO of Sun Global Investments, is struck by the contrast between Britain\u2019s latest growth figures and this month\u2019s eurozone PMIs: Britain\u2019s has achieved a 0.4% growth rate in the last quarter, a respectable enough figure. However, UK business investment only rose by 0.2% in the last quarter, down from 0.5% in April-June which suggests that the growth rate is set to slow. Meanwhile over in Europe, the recovery of growth continues as France outpaced Germany, and the Eurozone posted its strongest growth in over six years. We expect the German economy to ride though the coalition crisis which is expected to lead to fresh elections.\u201d The day after the UK budget is traditionally a time for the Institute of Fiscal Studies to explain what\u2019s really going on. And today, the IFS has torpedoed the suggestion that Britain\u2019s era of austerity is over. There are plenty more cuts coming our way. IFS director Paul Johnston has also flagged up that Britain\u2019s economy is expected to lag other nations over the next five years. He also rebutted some criticism of the decision to abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers purchasing homes under \u00a3300,000: Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has more details. Here are some charts from the Bank of England\u2019s gender pay report. They showing how female staff at the bank receive smaller bonuses on average, as well as less basic pay. So, lots of work still to do. But as the Financial Times\u2019s Sarah O\u2019Connor points out, it\u2019s worse elsewhere in the City.... Newsflash: The Bank of England has just released its gender pay gap. It shows that male staff at the UK central bank were paid 18.6% more than female colleagues this year (that\u2019s the mean gender pay gap for base pay). That\u2019s down from 22% in 2013. Governor Mark Carney says he is confident that men and women at the Bank are paid equally for doing the same job. However, the \u201cgreater proportion of men than women in senior roles creates a gender pay gap\u201d. Rating agency Moody\u2019s has now weighed in, saying that Britain\u2019s growth has \u2018stabilised\u2019 in the last quarter. In a new report, Moody\u2019s says the Brexit vote has had a \u201cmoderate negative impact\u201d so far. They also predict that labour market growth will remain muted, and that inflation will peak in the next few months. Breaking: UK retail sales have bounced back this month after a shock slowdown in October. That\u2019s according to the CBI\u2019s survey of the sector, which found that clothing shops and grocers have enjoyed a pick-up in demand during November. Some 39% of shops questioned by the CBI reported that sales volumes were up on a year ago in November, while 13% said they were down, giving a balance of +26%. That\u2019s a strong recovery from October\u2019s -36, which was the weakest balance since the last recession in March 2009. But it\u2019s not all good news - retailers are also laying off staff, and worried that trading will be tough next year. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, remains cautious, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see retail sales rebound this month after a big dip, but let\u2019s be clear: our high streets are not out of the woods. Ahead of the crucial run up to Christmas, the weaker pound has pushed up prices and retailers are nervous about business conditions and are trimming their workforces. Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online trading platform, Infinox, can\u2019t find much cheer in today\u2019s UK growth update. Today\u2019s second estimate of GDP confirms what we already know. Growth this year has slowed considerably as a result of the uncertainty caused by Brexit and is set to be 1.5% at best.... Anaemic growth looks here to stay for years to come at a time when the other major economies of the world are enjoying a boom. \u201cWith business investment softening by 0.2% between July and September and productivity growth this decade forecast to be the worst for 205 years, there\u2019s little joy to be found in the economy just over a month before Christmas.\u201d Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist at WorldFirst, reckons British businesses are suffering from Brexit uncertainty, and the government\u2019s failure to plan for the future better. Cook says: \u201cThe UK economy owes everything to the overstretched consumer. GDP grew by 0.4% in Q3, with all of that growth coming from consumer spending. Business investment has slowed and trade subtracted 0.5% from overall growth. \u201cThis does not surprise us at WorldFirst given our latest Global Trade Barometer showed that as many as 1.1m fewer small businesses are trading internationally compared to this time last year. These businesses represent the back bone of the British economy and are being held back by uncertainty over future trade relations, poor productivity and an incoherent industrial strategy from Westminster.\u201d Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank says household spending is being supported by debt, helping to prop growth up. Here\u2019s his take on the GDP figures: Despite the Brexit driven temporary real wage squeeze caused by rising import prices, households are still coping well. Private consumption growth accelerated to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter from 0.2%. Sterling has fallen by c12% on a trade-weighted basis since the Brexit vote in June 2016. Households are smoothing their real consumption by borrowing a little more and saving a little less for a while until real wages begin to rise again \u2013 probably early next year. Today\u2019s growth figures confirm that Britain is lagging behind its major European rivals. Germany, for example, grew twice as fast in the last three months - expanding by a healthy 0.8%. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, says British growth remains \u201cbelow par\u201d. The economy keeps chugging along, but comfortably at the slowest rate in the G7, and Britain is in danger of being left behind. \u201cAfter a number of growth forecast downgrades in Chancellor Philip Hammond\u2019s Budget speech, we may need to face up to the fact that the situation isn\u2019t going to get better any time soon. \u201cInflation is up, but productivity and wage growth are down, which means there is far less money in the average Brit\u2019s pocket. After Hammond announced a further \u00a390bn worth of borrowing, the squeeze is only going to continue \u2013 worrying times for the man on the street.\u201d Economics journalist Dharshini David is also concerned by the breakdown of the GDP report: Disappointingly, UK business investment only rose by 0.2% in the last quarter, down from 0.5% in April-June. That\u2019s the weakest quarterly growth since the end of 2016. It suggests that firms are reluctant to spend on new machinery and equipment in the current uncertain economic climate. This is a worrying sign, as business spending is a key driver of productivity growth. The new GDP figures also show that net trade had a negative impact on UK growth. But, household spending actually picked up, according to the Office for National Statistics. It says: The rate of growth in household final consumption expenditure strengthened to 0.6% between Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 2017, with car purchases recovering somewhat from a low Quarter 2. Britain\u2019s film industry also had a good quarter: Britain\u2019s industrial base was stronger than expected in the last three months, but builders had a bad quarter. The Office for National Statistics has revised up its estimate for industrial production growth, from 1% to 1.1%, in July-September. BUT, it has also revised construction output down to -0.9%, from -0.7%. Service sector output is unchanged, at +0.4%. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s growth rate in the last quarter has been confirmed at 0.4%, in line with the first estimate of GDP. Now onto the details.... The strength of growth in the eurozone is a stark contrast with Britain\u2019s weakening economy. Julien Lafargue, global investment strategist at JP Morgan, says Europe\u2019s economy looks strong - meaning he favours owning share in European companies rather than UK ones. Lafargue explains: The economic momentum remains very supportive in the Eurozone. With the rate of backlog accumulation rising despite companies hiring at the fastest pace in years, we expect to see further investments to boost production capacity. This in turn should support growth in the region and extend the cycle. Within the EU, this trend is in stark contrast with the picture depicted yesterday by the UK\u2019s Chancellor and the Office for Budget responsibility which lowered UK\u2019s GDP growth forecasts for every year until 2021. Given this strong economic backdrop in the Eurozone vs. a UK budget that offered little in the form of stimulus, we continue to prefer Continental European equities. Boom! Eurozone companies are enjoying their strongest month since April 2011. The latest survey from data firm Markit shows that Europe\u2019s recovery strengthened, with companies reporting a surge in output and hiring. This pushed Markit\u2019s composite PMI - a health check on companies across Europe - to 57.5, the highest in six and a half years. France had a particularly strong month, outpacing Germany for only the fourth time in over five years. German growth remained strong too, though, suggesting its economy can ride out the coalition crisis that could lead to fresh elections soon. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit says \u201cbusiness is booming\u201d in Europe, led by manufacturing. Growth kicked higher in November to put the region on course for its best quarter since the start of 2011. The PMI is so far running at a level signalling a 0.8% increase in GDP in the final quarter of 2017, which would round-off the best year for a decade. Jobs are being created at the fastest rate since the dot-com boom, yet despite this increase in operating capacity firms are struggling to meet demand. Backlogs of uncompleted work are growing at the fastest rate for over a decade, often resulting in a sellers\u2019 market as customers struggle to source goods and services. Prices are consequently rising at an increased rate. Newsflash: The UK is on course for the longest fall in living standards since records began in the 1950s. That\u2019s according to the Resolution Foundation, whose analysts must have worked late into the night crunching yesterday\u2019s Budget, and the verdict of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Resolution have found that the fall in living standards which began in 2015 will continue until 2020 - even longer than after the financial crisis: It also warned that Britain\u2019s productivity is the worst since the Battle of Borodino. On a ten-year rolling basis, productivity growth is set to fall to 0.1 per cent by the end of 2017, marking this as the worst decade for productivity growth since 1812 \u2013 when Napoleon was busy invading Russia. As a result the economy is on course to be \u00a342bn smaller in 2022, compared to the March 2017 forecast. More here: Philip Hammond is touring the nation\u2019s TV and radio stations this morning, defending the budget. On Radio 4, the chancellor was grilled about productivity; Q: Our productivity is still desperate. We have not been able to get a grip on it. You have been in power for seven years. Why haven\u2019t you done something about this? Hammond says the country was facing a fiscal and economic crisis after the crash. Q: That was 10 years ago. Hammond says, as soon as the government could start investing again, it did so. He put more capital investment in yesterday. Over this parliament the government will be spending \u00a325bn more on capital investment than under Labour. Q: But people want to know you understand why productivity is so low. You don\u2019t seem to understand. Hammond says there is a debate about this among economists. But we know the reasons. British businesses have less capital investment per worker than their competitors. Infrastructure spending is low, and skill levels are low. Q: So why aren\u2019t you doing something about it? We are, says Hammond. He says too few people have maths qualifications. He is investing in maths teaching. But that is a generational change. It will take years for the benefits to come through. He says it is tempting for politicians to use the money for short-term fixes. But he wants to focus on measures that will deliver improvements over decades. That is what countries like Germany do. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has full details: Centrica\u2019s slide has helped to pull the London stock market into the red. The FTSE 100 is down 36 points, or 0.5%, in early trading. Other European market are also in the red; exporters are suffering because the US dollar fell last night, after America\u2019s central bank sounded cautious about inflation prospects. Over in the City, shares in energy supplier Centrica have plunged by 15%. British Gas\u2019s parent company has revealed it lost 823,000 customer in the four months between June and October. It has also admitted that earnings will miss market expectations this year. It blamed lower than expected adjusted operating profit in North America and the UK. Centrica also warned that: We are also reflecting the expected impact of warmer than normal weather across October and November. That sent traders scrambling to sell shares at the start of trading, sending Centrica down 26p to 136.7p. That\u2019s a 14-year low, and the biggest daily tumble in 20 years. Yesterday\u2019s productivity downgrades are a \u2018Suez moment\u2019 for the UK economy, says our economics editor Larry Elliott. He writes: It is now more than 10 years since the start of the financial crisis and the OBR\u2019s gloomy outlook marks the moment when Britain has to stop kidding itself. Growth is not going to return to its pre-crash levels. The 21% gap between output per hour now and where it would have been had it remained on its pre-2007 path is never going to be closed. Britain is substantially and permanently poorer. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We got a worrying glimpse into Britain\u2019s economic future yesterday. Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn budget came laced with growth downgrades, forcing another \u00a390bn of borrowing over the next few years. As feared, the experts at the Office for Budget Responsibility threw in the towel over the health of the UK economy, conceding that we won\u2019t return to the pre-crisis productivity growth of around 2% per year. Productivity growth is now expected to only average 1.4% - including just 0.9% this year. A dire outlook. Economist and politicians will continue to probe the budget today, kicking the tires of policies such as the (criticised) stamp duty reform for first time buyers, (limited) universal credit changes and the rise in the personal tax allowance (which will benefit high earners the most). Britain\u2019s economy will still be in the spotlight this morning; we\u2019re getting the second estimate of UK growth in the third quarter of 2017. It\u2019s likely to confirm that growth chugged along at just 0.4% in July to September. These figures will give a better insight into the economy, showing how government spending, personal consumption and business investment changed during the quarter. Analysts at Royal Bank of Canada say: Today\u2019s second estimate of UK Q3 GDP isn\u2019t expected to result in a revision to the first estimate of 0.4% q/q expansion. Since that preliminary estimate, the incoming information has revealed industrial production to have been stronger than initially thought and construction to be even weaker. The expenditure breakdown becomes available on this occasion. The contribution of consumer spending has been weakening in 2017 and, having seen some of the early indicators of retail activity for October coming in on the soft side, we would caution against reading too much into any potential improvement in Q3 as far as consumption is concerned. In the City, energy firm Centrica, wine supplier Majestic Wine and retailer Mothercare are all reporting results. Plus, fresh data will show how Europe\u2019s private sector and Britain\u2019s shops are faring this month.

We have not been able to get a grip on it. You have been in power for seven years. Why haven\u2019t you done something about this?</em></p> <p>Hammond says the country was facing a fiscal and economic crisis after the crash.</p> <p><em>Q: That was 10 years ago.</em></p> <p>Hammond says, as soon as the government could start investing again, it did so. He put more capital investment in yesterday. Over this parliament the government will be spending \u00a325bn more on capital investment than under Labour.</p> <p><em>Q: But people want to know you understand why productivity is so low. You don\u2019t seem to understand.</em></p> <p>Hammond says there is a debate about this among economists. But we know the reasons. British businesses have less capital investment per worker than their competitors. Infrastructure spending is low, and skill levels are low.</p> <p><em>Q: So why aren\u2019t you doing something about it?</em></p> <p>We are, says Hammond.</p> <p>He says too few people have maths qualifications. He is investing in maths teaching. But that is a generational change. It will take years for the benefits to come through.</p> <p>He says it is tempting for politicians to use the money for short-term fixes.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond must borrow an extra \u00a390bn over the next five years after the Treasury\u2019s independent forecaster downgraded productivity growth. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) warned that the chancellor faced a long period of lower than expected wages growth that would dent tax receipts and push up borrowing. The cumulative effect over the life of the parliament would add \u00a390.5bn to the UK\u2019s debt pile and jeopardise Hammond\u2019s target of balancing the government\u2019s books by 2025, it said. The Treasury said that once the positive effects of an increase in employment and better than expected borrowing over the last year are taken into account, the net borrowing rise would be \u00a335bn, putting the chancellor in a position to reach his target of creating a surplus in the middle of the next decade. But some analysts said the OBR\u2019s revision failed to go far enough and it continued to overestimate the capacity of British businesses to invest in new equipment and processes to drive up productivity. They argued that the forecaster should have gone further and predicted that productivity growth \u2013 which measures the average output per hour worked \u2013 of almost zero over the last seven years would continue for another five years. Joanna Davies, a UK economist at Fathom Consulting, said the OBR\u2019s new forecast that productivity would increase at a rate of 1.1% until 2022 \u2013 almost half the 2.1% average seen in the 30 years before 2007 \u2013 still looked ambitious. She said the prospects for GDP growth would suffer a severe knock-on effect from lower productivity and a rapidly ageing population. \u201cOver the last five years, productivity growth has averaged just 0.3%,\u201d she said. \u201cCombined with UN projections for working-age population growth, the UK\u2019s trend rate of overall economic growth is probably somewhere in the range 0.5%-1% \u2013 around half the 1.5% assumed by the OBR.\u201d The OBR chair, Robert Chote, said GDP growth would not only be hit by lower productivity, but also a weaker than expected export sector that would fail to benefit significantly from the lower pound. Meanwhile, low wage growth would dampen consumer spending while Brexit uncertainty would deter businesses from investing or opening new offices and factories. Sir Charles Bean, one of the three OBR committee members who draw up the forecasts, said: \u201cWe think at some point productivity will improve. There are good grounds to believe that as the labour market tightens, businesses will need to invest.\u201d He said the OBR committee did not subscribe to the \u201ctechno-pessimistic\u201d view that robots and other intelligent machines were about to deskill the labour force and force down wages. He said it was more likely that investments in new machinery would enhance productivity. But the former deputy governor of the Bank of England admitted there was great uncertainty about how much businesses would invest to raise their workers\u2019 productivity. \u201cThere is not a lot of science in measuring the path of productivity and others could take a different view,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen such a long period of low productivity growth since the 19th century, so we are in uncharted territory.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear when the effects of government measures to enhance workers\u2019 skills will take effect. Likewise infrastructure investments. Both of them can take a long time to take effect.\u201d Howard Archer, an economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, said the OBR\u2019s new figures \u201cmay now be overcautious\u201d. He added: \u201cIt seems that the OBR may now be erring on the side of caution on UK productivity growth, having been repeatedly overoptimistic in recent years.\u201d Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the chancellor had been saved from his borrowing spiralling further by a switch in the classification of housing associations, which took their debt off government books. The Office for National Statistics recently said housing associations should be considered private bodies after the government passed an act of parliament relinquishing some control over their day-to-day running. Tombs said: \u201cThe chancellor would have been boxed into a corner, had the government not loosened its control over housing associations last week, enabling them to be reclassified as private bodies. This statistical deception, alongside other accounting adjustments, reduced borrowing by \u00a35bn a year, or \u00a324bn over the five years from 2017-18.\u201d He said Hammond was only able to announce a series of measures \u2013 from boosting NHS funding to easing business rate rises \u2013 that cost \u00a317bn over the next five years after housing associations were shifted off the government\u2019s balance sheet. Victoria Clarke, a UK economist at banking group Investec, said downward revisions to GDP growth were \u201ca natural consequence of the more realistic view of productivity trends\u201d, and came despite the expected buoyancy of the global economy. She said: \u201cOn the back of this it looks doubtful, at best, that Hammond can achieve his broad objective of balancing the public finances as soon as possible in the \u2018next\u2019 parliament.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on 23 November 2017 to add a response from the Treasury in the third paragraph \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The excitement over the chancellor\u2019s modest surprise \u2013 the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers purchasing properties worth up to \u00a3300,000 \u2013 lasted about five minutes. The Office for Budget Responsibility quickly pointed out that this supposed giveaway will increase house prices. The winners will be people who already own a house, not those trying to enter the market. Philip Hammond might counter that first-time buyers, by saving up to \u00a35,000 in stamp duty, will be able to save more money for a deposit. Yes, but the numbers won\u2019t impress outside London. Anthony Codling, analyst at City firm Jefferies, calculates that the average buyer spends \u00a3165,000 on a first home. The removal of stamp duty on a such a property will be worth \u00a3800 \u2013 small beer if you\u2019re aiming for a 5% deposit, representing \u00a38,250 in this example. \u201cIf the goal of the budget was to help increase home ownership, the wrong lever has been pulled,\u201d was Codling\u2019s common sense conclusion. Still, it might be said, the chancellor\u2019s entire package of housing measures was worth \u00a344bn, which sounds like serious money. Sort of. Only about \u00a315bn represents new support and the various forms of funding, loans and guarantees will arrive over five years. Given the size of the housing problem, you cannot call it radical intervention. What about the threat to clobber big housebuilders who hoard land? That line put a minor dent in share prices, but let\u2019s see what Oliver Letwin\u2019s review turns up. The companies swear they\u2019re not running quasi investment funds. They say they go to work as soon as planning permissions arrive in \u201cimplementable\u201d form \u2013 in other words, after relevant conditions, covering road access or whatever, have been met. That final stage can take a year or more, they say, which sounds plausible. The real problem may be more subtle. It\u2019s about the speed of building once it starts. The firms plead it\u2019s not possible to build out major sites \u2013 those on which a couple of thousand new homes are being constructed \u2013 any faster. They say they fear flooding local markets. Really? The argument sounds self-serving. The real worry may be that cutting selling prices would hurt profits. Given that many big housebuilders are generating fat margins of 25%, many would conclude that what\u2019s really needed is a big prod to hurry up. A leisurely pace suits the builders too well. Selling prices flutter higher and the flow of dividends to shareholders, which has been spectacular in the past half-decade, is not threatened. But it\u2019s hard to see how Letwin\u2019s \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d review could crack this more complex problem. Pure landmarking is relatively simple to spot. It is trickier to define, and then punish, slow build-out. On the plus side, Hammond has grasped the need to encourage small housebuilders. There will be \u00a3630m to \u201cunstick\u201d the delivery of 40,000 homes on small sites, meaning those that the big firms ignore. This effort to identify a fresh supply of brownfield urban sites is essential. It\u2019s where the chancellor\u2019s predecessor should have started, instead of stimulating demand with help to buy. Guarantees to support new rental properties are also welcome. That part of the market is often over-looked in the obsession over home ownership. Hammond could have gone further: a wall of pension fund money wants to invest in the rental sector. Yet there\u2019s a further threat to the chancellor\u2019s ambition to get 300,000 additional homes a year built by the mid-2020s: the shortage of labour, a problem that Brexit may intensify. An extra \u00a334m \u201cto develop construction skills across the country\u201d will barely move the dial. Believe in the 300,000 target only when it has been met. VAT fraud needs joint liability laws The best announcement in the budget was the vow to crack down on online VAT fraud \u2013 meaning the practice of firms, often Chinese, illegally selling goods tax-free to UK consumers on sites such as Amazon and eBay. The chancellor\u2019s proposal will make online marketplaces jointly liable for VAT. Good move. Past investigations by the Guardian have demonstrated how rife the fraud is. We found sellers trading without displaying VAT numbers. Others showed made-up numbers or numbers cloned from unsuspecting legitimate businesses. Relying on Amazon and eBay to warn sellers of their obligations, or to delist offenders, has achieved little. Hammond put the cost to the taxpayer of VAT fraud at \u00a31.2bn per year. If such a sum was being leaked via traditional retailers, there would be outrage. The online giants usually grumble that they shouldn\u2019t be responsible for the VAT compliance of independent sellers. That is disingenuous nonsense. They have helped to create the problem \u2013 joint liability may make them solve it. \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Selling prices flutter higher and the flow of dividends to shareholders, which has been spectacular in the past half-decade, is not threatened. </p> \n<p>But it\u2019s hard to see how Letwin\u2019s \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d review could crack this more complex problem. Pure landmarking is relatively simple to spot. It is trickier to define, and then punish, slow build-out.</p> \n<p>On the plus side, Hammond has grasped the need to encourage small housebuilders. There will be \u00a3630m to \u201cunstick\u201d the delivery of 40,000 homes on small sites, meaning those that the big firms ignore. This effort to identify a fresh supply of brownfield urban sites is essential. It\u2019s where the chancellor\u2019s predecessor should have started, instead of stimulating demand with help to buy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7b0fb4cb-830d-4770-a136-94cec28c0521\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stamp duty is a tax charged by the government when you buy a property for more than \u00a3125,000. The amount you pay depends on the cost of your new home.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The tax was first introduced in 1694 as a way to raise money for a war against France, and was eventually introduced on a wide range of purchases, including newspapers and perfume. </p>\n    <p>In 2003, the then chancellor Gordon Brown introduced stamp duty land tax (SDLT) to replace the old duty and homebuyers became legally responsible for declaring their purchase and paying the tax. </p>\n    <p>In recent years successive chancellors have used the tax as a lever to alter the course of the housing market. In 2008 and 2010 Alistair Darling launched stamp duty holidays aimed at encouraging sales; in 2012 George Osborne introduced higher rates for \u00a32m-plus properties bought by overseas companies; and in 2016 he added a surcharge on second homes in a bid to calm the buy-to-let market. </p>\n    <p>The biggest change came in December 2014 when Osborne overhauled the way stamp duty was calculated. Prior to that, the whole value of a purchase was taxed at the same rate, leading to property prices bunching underneath each threshold. Since then, it has been charged like income tax \u2013 you pay a higher rate only on the part of your purchase that falls over each threshold. Anyone buying a property costing up to \u00a3937,000 pays less than under the old rules.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Guarantees to support new rental properties are also welcome. That part of the market is often over-looked in the obsession over home ownership. Hammond could have gone further: a wall of pension fund money wants to invest in the rental sector.</p> \n<p>Yet there\u2019s a further threat to the chancellor\u2019s ambition to get 300,000 additional homes a year built by the mid-2020s: the shortage of labour, a problem that Brexit may intensify. An extra \u00a334m \u201cto develop construction skills across the country\u201d will barely move the dial. Believe in the 300,000 target only when it has been met.</p> \n<h2>VAT fraud needs joint liability laws</h2> \n<p>The best announcement in the budget was the vow to crack down on online VAT fraud \u2013 meaning the practice of firms, often Chinese, illegally selling goods tax-free to UK consumers on sites such as Amazon and eBay. The chancellor\u2019s proposal will make online marketplaces jointly liable for VAT. Good move.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/28/amazon-ebay-sellers-vat-fraud-ipads-tax-free\">Past investigations by the Guardian</a> have demonstrated how rife the fraud is. We found sellers trading without displaying VAT numbers. Others showed made-up numbers or numbers cloned from unsuspecting legitimate businesses.</p> \n<p>Relying on Amazon and eBay to warn sellers of their obligations, or to delist offenders, has achieved little. Hammond put the cost to the taxpayer of VAT fraud at \u00a31.2bn per year. If such a sum was being leaked via traditional retailers, there would be outrage.</p> \n<p>The online giants usually grumble that they shouldn\u2019t be responsible for the VAT compliance of independent sellers. That is disingenuous nonsense. They have helped to create the problem \u2013 joint liability may make them solve it.</p> \n<p>\u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Car production increased last month as rising exports made up for falling demand in the UK, new figures reveal. Just over 157,000 cars rolled off production lines in October, 3.5% more than the same month last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Exports were up by 5%, with more than 1.1m cars built for overseas markets so far this year, compared with a 2.9% fall in domestic demand. Production for the UK car market has now fallen for nine months in a row, to 28,178 in October. The SMMT blamed lower business and consumer confidence and confusion over government policies towards diesel vehicles. UK car sales have been declining since April and fell another 12% in October, with diesel transactions down nearly 30%. More than four out of five UK-built cars were shipped abroad last month, the highest proportion this year, with most going to other European countries. An independent forecast on how many cars will be built this year has been revised down from about 1.8m to 1.73m, said the SMMT. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see positive growth in exports this month and a slight increase in overall output. \u201cProduction for British consumers, however, has continued to fall as domestic demand for new cars decreased for the ninth month this year amid continued uncertainty over both Brexit and the government\u2019s air quality plans. \u201cIt\u2019s important that confidence is restored to the new car market, as sales of the latest cleaner, greener cars not only address air quality concerns but speed up activity on factory lines across the UK. The latest independent UK forecast report is worrying news for the sector, predicting annual output which is, at best, static compared with last year. \u201cThe industry needs stability and a clear roadmap for Brexit if we are to encourage investment and arrest the decline in both the market and business confidence.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
