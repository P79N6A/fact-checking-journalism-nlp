However, this is an area where UK goods exporters have struggled. Of the important Bric economies, China is the UK's largest goods export destination \u2013 ranked seventh. Russia, India and Brazil are ranked 12th, 18th and 27th respectively. The UK exports more goods to Ireland, the UK's fifth most important export partner, than to any of these key emerging Bric economies.\"</p> <p>Umunna said: \"Britain is in danger of missing out on the huge opportunities here in Africa. I was very struck by the warning given last year by former president Olusegun Obasanjo on how, in relation to Africa, Britain risks falling behind and how the energetic approach of the Chinese, the Indians and even the Brazilians risks trumping the strong historical and cultural ties we have. There can be no room for complacency.\"</p> <p>He added: \"In the first decade of this century, China's trade with Nigeria increased by a whopping 800%. By contrast, Britain exports more to the Czech Republic \u2013 a small country less than a 10th of the size and less than a 15th of the population \u2013 than it does to Nigeria. We are talking about the seventh largest country in the world. One in five of all Africans are Nigerian. Lagos is one of the largest cities in the world. Nigeria is not waiting around for anyone. It is closing in on South Africa to become the largest economy in Africa.</p> <p>\"As Europe's economies struggle to see any growth the IMF expects Nigeria's economy to grow by 7% next year alone,\" he added. \"The Nigerian middle class is growing fast. With it is coming rapid growth in demand for consumer goods. The export opportunities for British firms are vast and growing.\"</p>",

Between the first three months of 2012 and the first three months of 2013, exports to the EU dropped by almost 4%, prompting government efforts to forge closer trade links with the Brics. Daniel Solomon, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, said: \"Accessing high-growth emerging markets could help offset weak demand from the eurozone, supporting the economy through its impact on exports. However, this is an area where UK goods exporters have struggled. Of the important Bric economies, China is the UK's largest goods export destination \u2013 ranked seventh. Russia, India and Brazil are ranked 12th, 18th and 27th respectively. The UK exports more goods to Ireland, the UK's fifth most important export partner, than to any of these key emerging Bric economies.\" Umunna said: \"Britain is in danger of missing out on the huge opportunities here in Africa. I was very struck by the warning given last year by former president Olusegun Obasanjo on how, in relation to Africa, Britain risks falling behind and how the energetic approach of the Chinese, the Indians and even the Brazilians risks trumping the strong historical and cultural ties we have. There can be no room for complacency.\" He added: \"In the first decade of this century, China's trade with Nigeria increased by a whopping 800%. By contrast, Britain exports more to the Czech Republic \u2013 a small country less than a 10th of the size and less than a 15th of the population \u2013 than it does to Nigeria. We are talking about the seventh largest country in the world. One in five of all Africans are Nigerian. Lagos is one of the largest cities in the world. Nigeria is not waiting around for anyone. It is closing in on South Africa to become the largest economy in Africa. \"As Europe's economies struggle to see any growth the IMF expects Nigeria's economy to grow by 7% next year alone,\" he added. \"The Nigerian middle class is growing fast. With it is coming rapid growth in demand for consumer goods. The export opportunities for British firms are vast and growing.\"",

      "bodyText": "British Gas has been accused of being at the heart of an \"evil empire\" making hundreds of millions of pounds out of the misery of pensioners and vulnerable people forced to \"choose between heating and eating\". Sir Roger Carr, chairman of British Gas owner Centrica, was repeatedly forced to defend the company's reputation at its annual meeting after a string of shareholders accused company bosses of raking in \u00a316m in pay and bonuses from putting up the price of heating. The company said the \"strong performance\" from the cold winter put it on course to deliver full-year pre-tax profits of \u00a3602m. John Farmer, a well-known private shareholder, said the company was being \"vilified\" by customers fed up with the \"evil big six [energy firms] out to exploit\". Carr replied to the packed meeting in central London: \"Are we the evil empire? \"We are an extremely responsible and thoughtful company \u2026 We are a good business doing good things for this country.\" He said British Gas, which yesterday revealed the cold winter had led to an 18% jump in household gas usage in the first four months of the year, was \"not seeking to profit from the extreme winter\". Carr admitted that this would feed through to \"higher costs [ for consumers] at a time when people are already hard-pressed\". However, he promised that the company was not viewing the increase in customers' bills as \"a little bit of a bonanza\" that it will \"squirrel away\". He promised to use the extra cash to freeze prices \"for as long as possible\", but was unable to give any indication of how long such a freeze would remain. British Gas imposed a 6% price rise last November, adding \u00a380 to the average annual gas and electricity bill for the 8.4m households it serves. \"We will wait and see how much extra money [we make],\" Carr said. \"[And] some of that will be used to keep prices competitive \u2013 that's the right thing to do\". Ruth London, a pensioner and Fuel Poverty Action campaigner, accused the company of not doing enough to help the 7,200 people it has been claimed died last year because they could not afford to heat their home. \"Thousands go without food, so they don't freeze,\" she said. \"They are forced to choose between heating and eating, sometimes [going without] both, and in some cases dying.

The Co-op is insisting it has plenty of liquidity and will not need a bailout as it looks for ways to find the extra capital by selling off its insurance arm and scaling back its ambitions.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time to wrap up for the day. To catch up on tonight's eurogroup press conference, see 7.36pm onwards for full highlights. Here's a closing summary. \u2022 Greece and Cyprus are both receiving their next aid payments, in a move that removes the danger of either country running short of cash in the next few weeks. After a meeting in Brussels this afternoon, the Eurogroup of finance ministers announced that Greece has done enough to quality for its next loans. \u20ac4.3bn will be handed over immediately, and the rest in June when a few outstanding issues have been addressed. (see 7.43pm for details) \u2022 Cyprus was awarded its first aid tranche under its bailout agreement earlier this afternoon, by the European Stability Mechanism. The Nicosia government gets \u20ac2bn immediately, and a further \u20ac1bn in June (see 3.30pm). \u2022 The Eurogroup also warned Slovenia that it must do more to reform its economy and strengthen its banks. (see 7.48pm) \u2022 In Greece... there were protests tonight over the government's attempts to stop a teachers strike. See 5.24pm onwards. \u2022 And grim construction data showed that the number of new building permits in Greece has almost halved, year-on-year. See 11.53am \u2022 The prime ministers of Spain and Portugal challenged Europe to agree banking union quickly, and called for more help to address their unemployment crises. See 5.58pm for a full report. \u2022 Israel's central bank became the latest to cut interest rates, and also launched a programme to stop the shekel appreciating. See 1.50pm \u2022 A survey by Fitch found that a majority of investors believe financial markets are too calm, or too bullish, as the eurozone crisis has further to run. See 12.29pm \u2022 Italy held a succesful bond auction (see 11.31am onwards). \u2022 And another ECB policymaker hinted at negative interest rates for bank deposits (see 10.13am). Thanks for reading, and for all the comments as ever. I'll be back tomorrow morning Goodnight! GW Not the most dramatic eurogroup meeting since the financial crisis struck.... and that's not a bad thing either. And that's the end of the eurogroup press conference. Asked about plans for eurozone banking reform, Jeroen Dijsselbloem repeats his goal of agreeing rules for bank recapitalisaion by the end of next month. That would help pave the way to a single supervisory mechanism for the euro financial sector, from the summer of 2014. A question on Greece, and the news today that the Troika's latest assessment shows that further measures may be needed to meet its targets in 2015 and 2016 (as covered at 2.25pm) Rehn (again) says it is too early to say if additional measures needed, because Greek economic growth could be higher than expected. OK, but since the financial crisis began Greece has consistently missed its forecasts to the downside.... On Portugal... Olli Rehn (who's doing the bulk of the talking tonight) says that its reform programme is \"by and large\" on track, and that political agreement has been reached on the seventh review of the Portuguese bailout program. A Spanish journalist asks about the unemployment crisis raging in his country. Olli Rehn replies that the jobless crisis must be addressed, but puts part of the blame on \"large and unsustainable macroeconomic balances\" within the Spanish economy. Matina Stevis of the Wall Street Journal/Dow Jones asks about another key issue, the legality (or not) of introducing banking union and a single resolution scheme under the current EU treaties. In reply, Jeroen Dijsselbloem admits that there are 'different opinions' over the important question of whether treaty change is needed. That shouldn't prevent the eurozone moving \"far and as fast as we can\", he adds. And Olli Rehn says he's confident that all the elements of a banking union can be decided on the basis of the current treaty. But he then adds that work is continuing on the precise legal basis of a single resolution mechanism. How long will Cyprus suffer capital controls? Olli Rehn says that the eurozone would like to see the Cyprus government relax capital controls \"for the point of view of economic recovery\". However, this could only happen when it was \"safe, from the point of view of capital outflows\". UPDATE: To clarify, the capital controls are an issue for the Cyprus government, not the eurozone. Rehn's point is that the eurozone would like them lifted, but only when the moment is right Klaus Regling of the ESM, who is also taking part in the press conference, denies that the Cyprus crisis has caused alarm across the eurozone. He points to a succesful Portuguese debt auction last week. Asked about Slovenia's efforts to avoid a bailout, Olli Rehn says it's too early to say whether the country's reform programme is sufficient and credible. On Greece, Rehn say the next 'review mission' will take place in the coming weeks. He also explains that Athens is expected to meet the remaining 'prior actions' this week, to ease the way for its \u20ac2.3bn aid payment in June. Now Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for monetary union, speaks -- saying it's important the eurozone leaders work \"intensively\" to reach a solution on rules for bank recapitalisation by June. Rehn also warned that Europe's banking sector remained a drag on its economy, as bad debts have not been recognised and cleaned-up - as happened in the US. Slovenia also gets a rebuke, with Dijsselbloem saying the Eurogroup agreed that the Slovenian government must take swift action to reform its economy and restore trust in its banks. Not sure that will exactly boster confidence in the Slovenian system at this time.... And nor is Lorcan Roche Kelly, chief Europe strategist at Trend Macrolytics: There's also a seperate statement on Cyprus - online here. On Cyprus, Jeroen Dijsselbloem says that the Cypriot government has delivered on its bailout promises. He welcomed the news today that the European Stability Mechanism has issued \u20ac2bn to Cyprus today (see 3.30pm), with another \u20ac1bn on the way. The Eurogroup has issued a statement on Greece - it's online here. It confirms that Greece is ready to get \u20ac4.2bn of aid immediately, and a further \u20ac3.3bn \u20ac2.3bn once remaining measure have been taken (as Jeroen Dijsselbloem outlined at 7.40pm). Here's the key statement: The Eurogroup concludes that the necessary elements are in place for Member States to finalise the relevant national procedures required for the approval of the next EFSF instalment, which amounts to \u20ac7.5 bn. The disbursement will take place in two sub-tranches. A first sub-tranche of \u20ac4.2 bn will be approved by the EWG and the EFSF Board of Directors in the following days, following the completion of the national procedures and the full implementation of the prior actions. The disbursement of the second sub-tranche will be made in June 2013, linked to the implementation of the MoU milestones as agreed between Greece and the Troika. On Greece, Dijsselbloem says that Greece has been making tremendous efforts, and claimed those efforts are now bearing results. The Eurogroup has identified three priorities for Greece before it gets its next aid tranche -- reforming its tax collection, opening up some professions, and reforming its public services. Dijsselbloem says these remaining hurdles can be addressed in the coming days. The press conference is underway! Jeroen Dijsselbloem says the Eurogroup considered the latest Spring forecasts from the EC (which warned of a deeper recession this year). Dijsselbloem said Europe was \"Not out of the woods\", but was paving the way to sustainable growth and jobs. Dijsselbloem added that the Eurogroup had welcomed the new Italian finance minister, Fabrizio Saccomanni, and urged him to deliver the 'ambitious structual reform agenda' needed to meet its targets. Tonight's press conference in Brussels will be streamed online here , and should start shortly. Something of a light-hearted atmosphere in Brussels this evening - a sign that the eurozone crisis is in a calmer patch: Word from Brussels that the eurogroup meeting has ended, and journalists are heading for the press conference room..... #cancelsplantogohome Greece's Kathimerini also reckons that the eurogroup ministers have agreed to hand over \u20ac7.5bn of loans to Athens, writing: Although the meeting of eurozone finance ministers was continuing on Monday, reliable sources told Kathimerini that the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is due to convene on Wednesday to approve the transfer of \u20ac4.bn. The money is expected to be disbursed on Friday. Following on from this, if Greece completes the \"milestones\" it has agreed for May, then 3.3 billion euros will be released in June. A troika review will not be needed for this disbursement, which will be agreed by the Euro Working Group. Greece's Capital.gr is reporting tonight that Eurogroup ministers have, as expected, decided to approve its next aid payment, worth \u20ac7.5bn. The story's online here (in Greek). It says that Greek officials believe \u20ac4.2bn of loans will be handed over immediately, followed by a second tranche of \u20ac3.3bn in June once various structural measures are agreed . Nothing official yet, though. Earlier today the prime ministers of Spain and Portugal put more pressure on the eurozone to agree full eurozone banking union, and called for more help to address the tragedy of youth unemployment in their countries. In the face of apparent foot-dragging from Germany (see 3.04pm), Spain's Mariano Rajoy and Portugual's Pedro Passos Coelho were united, at the Iberian Summit in Madrid. AP has the details: The leaders of Spain and Portugal on Monday demanded that the 17-nation eurozone speed up efforts to create a banking union and complained that credit is frozen in their countries, preventing economic growth and crucial job creation. Many banks are lending at relatively high rates because they are worried about the weak economy. Those higher borrowing rates are making it difficult for households and companies to spend and invest. \"The money from the banking system isn't getting to the businesses or into the economy,\" Portugal's Pedro Coelho said after meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Their bilateral government summit in Madrid came as European finance ministers were gathering in Brussels to discuss the continent's financial crisis. Both Rajoy and Passos Coelho called on the European Union to move swiftly to create a regional banking union and to slow down budget cuts to help the economy grow. \"Investment is the only way to create jobs,\" Passos Coelho said. \"If there's no financing, it'll be very hard for companies to grow and build up their business.\" Spain has been in recession for most of the past four years and has a record 27.2 percent unemployment rate. Portugal, with a 17.7 percent jobless rate, is one of four eurozone countries to have received a sovereign bailout. Both leaders said that more must also be done to reduce the crushing unemployment rates, which are particularly high for young people. Protest marches are also taking place in Athens and Thessaloniki tonight, against the Greek government's attempts to prevent teachers holding a strike this Friday (as explained at 5.24pm) Theodora Oikonomides, who blogs/tweets as the Irate Greek, is collecting photos from the scene on Twitter: Over in Greece, tensions are rising between protesting schoolteachers and the government ahead of a planned strike later this week. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Piling on the pressure, the civil servants union ADEDY has now announced that it will stage a 24-hour strike Tuesday in a show of solidarity for school teachers. The walk-out follows the government\u2019s decision to issue civil mobilization orders to prevent high school teachers from staging industrial action when students begin sitting annual exams on May 17. \u201cWith this action we want to send a strong message to the government that we will not allow public services to be dismantled, that we will not allow the country's constitution to be circumvented and the constitutional right of going on strike to be annulled,\u201d said Adedy\u2019s president Kostas Tsikrikas. The union, however, stopped short of endorsing the strike action during the exam period despite agreeing that internationally-mandated austerity measures \u2013 including pay cuts and job dismissals -- are \u201cbarbaric and unfair\u201d. It is the third time in less than a year that prime minister Antonis Samaras\u2019 governing coalition has resorted to the draconian measure of forcibly returning strikers to work. Helena adds: Throughout the day, the rthetoric on all sides has been racheted up with Olme, the 88,000-strong secondary school teachers union, theatening to haul the government before Greece\u2019s highest court, the council of state, if it dares to stop them from exerting their \u201csacred right\u201d of walking off the job. The sector is particularly enraged that school teachers will be amongst the first to be dismissed from posts under EU-IMF pressure to streamline the bloated civil service. \u201cWe will also denounce Greece before European organisations for the violation of constitutional rights. They are mobilizing us with a law that was drafted to be used at times of war or natural disasters,\u201d said Nikos Papachristos, the president of Olme. Admitting that the mobilization order was \u201cvery hard\u201d the government spokesman Simos Kedikogloyou said there was no going back. \u201cThe stike is tountamount to blackmailing society in a way that society can no longer accepted,\u201d he said this morning. The FTSE 100 has closed up 6 points tonight. That's its eighth day of gains in a row, the longest 'winning streak' since June 2011 (my colleague Nick Fletcher points out). it's been a quiet day generally, with the Spanish IBEX, Italian FTSE MIB and French CAC losing ground, and the German DAX little changed. Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG, said traders were in subdued mood as they pondered how, and when, the US Federal Reserve might begin slowing its quantitative easing programme. This debate was prompted by an article in the Wall Street Journal which said Fed officials planned to stop bond purchases in \"careful and potentially halting steps\". Beauchamp commented: It is only to be expected that the world\u2019s most powerful central bank has begun to at least think about an exit from stimulus. Indeed, it would be more worrying if it hadn\u2019t started to ponder how to wind down its unprecedented market support programme. Any withdrawal from stimulus will be a game of \u2018Grandmother\u2019s Footsteps\u2019; i.e. slow and measured, not an ignominious run for the door. This tweet sums up the Fed's 'dilemma': Just received some photos from the eurogroup meeting, showing finance ministers in cheery mood as the gathering got underway. Finland's Finance Minister Jutta Urpilainen and the new Cyprus finance minister, Haris Georgiades, also chatted before the meeting got underway: Cyprus's first aid payment has been officially approved by the European Stability Mechanism, the unit responsible for providing funding for euro-area bailouts. The Board of Directors of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) announced in the last few minutes that they have approved the Financial Assistance Facility Agreement for Cyprus. The ESM is now transferring \u20ac2bn to Nicosia immediately, with another \u20ac1bn due by the end of June. Klaus Regling, managing director of the ESM, announced: The loans granted by the ESM help to maintain financial stability in the euro area and buy time for Cyprus. This time enables Cyprus to undertake the reforms necessary to rebuild its economy on a sustainable basis. The ESM's decision means there's no danger of Cyprus running out of funding in the short term. It is due to receive a total of \u20ac10bn of external loans by early 2016, under the bailout deal agreed in March. The full press release is here: ESM disburses the first tranche of financial assistance to Cypru And there are more details of the bailout here: FAQ: Financial Assistance for Cyprus Peter Spiegel, the Financial Times's Brussels bureau chief, fears that tonight's eurogroup meeting could be a little light on hard news.... It appears that Germany's finance minister wasn't too keen to answer questions abotu tax evasion as he arrived for the eurogroup... at least from the Anglo-Saxon contingent. Juergen Baetz, AP's man in Brussels, reports: Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the eurogroup, has tried to calm concerns that Europe's plans for banking union are unravelling. Dijsselbloem told reporters outside the Justus Lipsius building that progress can be made without leaders deciding whether EU treaties would need rewriting. He made the comments amid concern that a single resolution scheme - which outlines how a failed bank is handled - cannot be set up by 2014, as planned, because it isn't legal under current treaties. Germany, for one, fears that changing the legislation will be lengthy and tricky Dijsselbloem said: Many of the building blocks for the banking union can be put in place. The issue of the treaty change can be addressed later on.... I think the Germans are putting forward understandable questions, which will have to be dealt with. But I don't see why that should stop us making progress on banking union. Reuters has got hold of a draft copy of the Troika's latest assessment of Greece, following their recent visit. No major shocks... international lenders concluded that Greece is on track to hit its targets this year and in 2014, but warns it will struggle to fully return to te financal markets after that date. The Troika also chides Athens for being too slow to privatise state assets.... Here's Reuters' early take: Greece is set to meet its budget targets this year and next but must step up privatisations and public sector reform, the country's international lenders said in a draft report obtained by Reuters on Monday. The report by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund assessing the country's progress in meeting its bailout goals, said the country's privatisation revenue target had been lowered for 2013 to \u20ac2bn ($2.59 billion) from \u20ac2.6bn euros. \"While progress has been made in preparing assets for privatisation, the overall speed of the privatisation process remains unsatisfactory,\" said the report. The document adds to evidence that the debt-laden country still faces big hurdles to standing on its own feet, despite the fiscal progress made by its coalition government and about 200 billion euros in rescue loans it has obtained from the EU/IMF since mid-2010. Even though Athens' overall debt outlook remains unchanged as it overachieves on budget cuts, Greece would take several years to fully return to capital markets once funding from the bailout programme ends in 2014, the report said. The Bank of Israel's statement accompanying today's surprise interest rate cut is online here: The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate by 0.25% to 1.5 %. Here's how it justified the move (taken two weeks before its next scheduled meeting). The appreciation trend of the shekel continues. In terms of the effective exchange rate, the shekel has appreciated by 2.4% in the past month, and by 5.4% in the past 3 months. The shekel\u2019s strength against the dollar and the euro during these periods stood out markedly in comparison with other currencies\u2019 movements vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar and euro. The appreciation trend was affected by, among other things, the beginning of natural gas production from the Tamar gas field, the interest rate reductions by central banks worldwide, notably the ECB, and the continued quantitative easing programs in several major economies around the world. Forecasts of global growth, in particular projections regarding Europe and China, have recently been revised downward. This moderation is expected to have an effect on Israel\u2019s economy. The move caused some chatter in the City: The Bank of Israel has joined the currency wars by cutting interest rates, and announcing a new programme to prevent the shekel's value rising too high. In an unexpected, unscheduled move, the Bank of Israel cut its key lending rate by a quarter of one percent, to 1.25%. It also declared it would intervene in the foreign exchange markets, by buying $2.1bn of other currencies by the end of 2013. It took the move because: [the shekel] stood out markedly in comparison with other currencies' movements vis-\u00e0-vis the dollar and euro. Another volley in the battle to devalue currencies.... Over in Northern Ireland, there is optimism that next month's G8 meeting will hand a \u00a340m stimulus to the local economy in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. Our correspondent Henry McDonald explains: While it is unclear if David Cameran, Barrack Obama, Vladimir Putin and the rest of the G8 can come up with plans to boost the global economy, the summit will at least generate \u00a340 million of extra business in Northern Ireland. According to research published today by Barclay's Bank and the University of Ulster, 85% of enterprises in Fermanagh believing holding the summit in the Irish border region will be good for them. The report also found there could be a longer term boost for tourism and foreign investment as the lakeland county gets a chance to show off its stunning scenery to the entire planet next month. Eurozone finance ministers have begun arriving in Brussels for this afternoon's meeting. Austria's Maria Fekter is there, but swept past the assembled press pack without giving a tasty soundbite. Interesting graph here, showing how bad debts have been rising alarmingly in weaker members of the eurozone since the crisis began: Those 'non-performing loans' could force euro banks to seek new capital, especially once eurozone banking supervision is agreed this summer (when the ECB will take responsibility for the sector)... The eurozone financial crisis is not over, according to a majority of clients surveyed by ratings agency Fitch. Fitch asked European fund managers (with \u20ac8.6trn of assets between them) whether the current buoyant financial markets reflected the reality of the situation. It found that 41% reckoned the worst of the crisis is over due to strong support from the ECB and policy makers. The remainder were split between: \u2022 29% who feel that this is a short-lived period of market calm; \u2022 30% who said markets are irrationally exuberant, ignoring the weak economic outlook for Europe. That suggests the recent market rally could unwind, as Fitch warned: If the latter is not validated by economic stabilisation and progress towards banking union, the danger is that market volatility will return with a vengeance over the summer, as it did in 2012 and 2011. Fitch also found that only 9% of respondents ranked inflation as a high risk, versus 29% who regarded deflation as a major concern risk. Fears that loose, unconventional monetary policy from the world's central banks would send prices spiraling have eased... For more on the inflation issue, check out these two blog posts: \u2022 Mark Dow: There is zero correlation between the Fed printing and the money supply. Deal with it. \u2022 @pawelmorski: Loose Money: Stop Us Before We Kill Again Dire construction data from Greece this morning. The number of permits issued to build new buildings tumbled by 42.9% year-on-year in February. Just 1,240 new permits were awarded to builders during the month, down from 2,27 in February 2012. In volume terms, activity has almost halved. It's another sign of the damage caused to Greece's economy, along with record unemployment and steadily shinking retail sales. Economist Shaun Richards has written a blogpost today, outlining how the Greek economic crisis has been far worse than the Troika anticipated: We are left three years after the bailout of Greece with shock and awe at the economic destruction that has been inflicted on Greece. Even the rose-tinted forecasts of the European Commission predict that her economy will shrink by 4.2% this year. Every time we see a number which shows a glimmer of hope we find another like todays truly dreadful construction numbers to shatter it. Again and again we are told that reovery is \u201cjust around the corner\u201d as we discover that like on a Roman road there are no corners in sight. I think that those responsible for this should be called to account for their actions. But sadly I see a world where one of them -Christine Lagarde- was elevated to the role of Manging Director of the IMF which can only be a sad indictment of these times. Please remember this when it is presented as a success later that the Greek people will have another 7.5 billion Euros added to their debts by the end of June. More here: Three years after the bailout of Greece the economy is still collapsing Here's early reaction to the Italian debt sale (see 10.31am) from sovereign bond expert Nick Spiro, of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. Spiro says the auction was 'solid', but warns that the market in bonds issued by Italy and Spain et al may be heading for turbulent times, eventually.... 1. Sentiment towards eurozone peripheral sovereign debt remains remarkably benign despite the severity of the economic downturns across the region and the recent sell-off in core government bond markets. Central bank policy action continues to hold down Spanish and Italian borrowing costs even though the sustainability of the rally is being increasingly called into question. Despite evident tensions within Mr Letta's new coalition government and extremely bleak economic conditions, the resilience of Italy's sovereign bond market remains undiminished. However, demand at Spanish and Italian auctions has been somewhat lacklustre of late. Today's Italian sale was reflective of this trend but still a solid auction, with yields coming in further and the Treasury hitting the top end of its target. 2. There's a growing acknowledgement on the part of many market participants that Spanish and Italian bond prices have become far too detached from fundamentals. Yet just because the rally appears way overdone doesn't mean that it's about to go into reverse. The \"reach for yield\" continues unabated and Spanish and Italian debt markets are among the biggest beneficiaries of this dramatic shift in investment behaviour. Yet there's an inescapable sense that peripheral government bond markets are due for a correction - the timing and the abruptness of it being a matter of debate. A successful bond auction for Italy. It just raised \u20ac8bn, its maximum target, at lower yields than earlier this year. Not much sign that investors are losing their appetite for peripheral bonds (although demand was down slightly). Here's the details: \u2022 \u20ac3.5bn of 2016 bonds, at a yield of 1.92%, down from 2.29% in April (lowest yield since January 2013) \u2022 \u20ac3bn of 2018 bonds, at a yield of 2.44%, down from 3.030% \u2022 \u20ac1.5bn of 2026 bonds, at a yields of 4.07%, down from 4.55% in February Financial analysts say it's a decent result, despite a drop in the bid-to-cover ratios (the measure of how over-subscribed the sale was) The euro has fallen this morning after Italy's central bank governor said the European Central Bank could cut its deposit rate (paid to banks who stash cash with it) into negative territory. Ignazio Visco, a member of the ECB's governing council, told CNBC that a negative deposit rate would be effective. The comments come 10 days after Mario Draghi revealed that the ECB was open to the idea of cutting the deposit rate below its current low of 0.0%. Visco said: We all agreed in the council that we have to look with care and in that case we may reduce the [deposit] rate.... We think that - and I personally think that, this is effective \u2013 the economy now is capable of taking it on board. Technically, we are equipped and ready to intervene. There may be unintended consequences - we know we may have to work on that - and we know how to work on that. Just to be clear, we're not talking about hitting depositors with negative savings rates (the ECB cut that rate to a record low of 0.5% this month). Imposing negative interest rates on bank deposits would be a significant development in the history of the eurozone. Visco's 'unintended consequences' include the possibility that banks buy riskier government bonds, rather than leaving money in the central bank to suffer a small loss each night. Banks could also actually cut liquidity, rather than pushing more credit out into the eurozone economy. But it's a complicated picture. A City pro who blogs and tweets as @barnejek did a fine post on this last Friday: What the central bank giveth, only the central bank taketh away. I don\u2019t question the fact that such a move will persuade banks to search for higher-yielding assets, ie loans but what I\u2019m trying to explain is that the liquidity in the banking system is like a hot potato. The central bank controls how much money there is in the system (using various ways, eg printing money, changing the reserve requirement etc) and the market only needs to decide the price of this money. The only way that lowering rates to the negative territory impacts the amount of cash in the system is because the central bank will be returning 99% of the money placed in it back to banks. But then which of the major central banks could even contemplate shrinking its balance sheet at the time when the global economy remains exceptionally fragile? And Frances Coppola's piece on the strange world of negative interest rates remains a must read, too. The Wall Street Journal's Matina Stevis predicts few fireworks in Brussels today, as euro finance ministers take stock of the situation: Heads up: Italy is auctioning up to \u20ac8bn of government debt this morning. RANsquawk has the details: Germany's finance minister declared this morning that Slovenia must swallow 'painful' measures if it is avoid seeking international help. Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble told Germany's SWR radio station that: Slovenia can manage [without a bailout programme]. However it must also carry out some painful restructuring [of its economy]. Quotes via Reuters. Last week the Slovenian government announced a package of state asset sales, a restructuring of its ailing banking sector, and a 2% increase in VAT. The European Commission is expected to give its verdict on the plan by the end of May. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes today that Spain's leaders are pinning their hopes on banking union, and eventually fiscal union too. But the risk of a \"crash landing\" remains dangerously real, he warns: That's not just because unemployment in Spain has risen by three and a half million since the start of the crisis and has now reached 27%, or that the domestic economy has shrunk by a sixth. It is that Spain is up to its eyeballs in debt, with no likely improvement in prospect. Despite austerity, little progress is being made in reducing the budget deficit and national debt is heading for well over 100% of gross domestic product. In the absence of more rapid growth and a banking union being agreed swiftly, a Greek-style debt restructuring seems eminently possible. Spain is perhaps the emblematic eurozone country. Its past performance reflects the design flaws in the single currency; it is trapped in a low-growth, high-debt vortex; and it can only recover if a reluctant Germany backs plans for integration. More here: Pedro Almod\u00f3var's Spanish disaster script is all too realistic Cyprus is hoping to patch up relations with the eurozone during today's Eurogroup meeting, its finance minister has said. Haris Georgiades (appointed in April) told CNBC that he was eager to repair any damage with relations with Brussels, following March's botched bailout that resulted in capital controls being imposed in Cyprus and heavy losses on larger bank customers. Georgiades also warned that Europe must learn lessons from the Cyprus debacle and rethink its decision-making process. Spains' Los Indignados movement held a 'silent scream' in Madrid's Puerta del Sol square yesterday evening, as part of Sunday's protests. This video clip shows that the famous square was packed, suggesting thousands of people took part: Sunday's protests marked two years of Los Indignados (the official anniversary is this Wednesday). Euronews has more details. Here's a flavour: \u201cI\u2019m here because, two years later, things are worse. We demanded social rights, and we\u2019re actually losing them,\u201d said one demonstrator. Another added: \u201cI think everybody who is really concerned about people and not about other interests, should be here. We\u2019re fighting to make everything fairer and to look after ourselves. There were marches in around 30 cities in Spain, according to local reports. Many people were protesting against banks repossessing homes from people who can no longer afford their repayments (more than 350,000 families have been evicted since the crisis started). Some photos: While the Eurogroup meeting takes place Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, will hosting his Portuguese counterpart, Pedro Passos Coelho, in Madrid. As well as geography, the two leaders are united in facing public opposition to their austerity programmes. \u2022 Rajoy and Passos Coelho at the Iberian summit \u2022 Finance ministers arrive in Brussels for the Eurogroup: 2pm BST \u2022 Eurogroup meeting begins 4pm BST \u2022 Eurogroup press conference: 11pm BST (!) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events across the world economy. Greece and Cyprus will be under the microscope today when Eurozone finance ministers meet to decide whether to extend bailout payments to both countries. Ministers are expected to give their approval to Cyprus's first aid tranche, worth \u20ac3bn, and also to sign off the latest instalment of Greece's own package. If that happens, expect to hear soothing words about Europe making progress... ...But the Eurogroup meeting will be overshadowed by two other unfolding stories -- Slovenia's efforts to avoid its own bailout, and the escalating social unrest in Spain. With Spanish unemployment at a blood-chilling 27%, there were fresh protests against the country's government over the weekend. Spain's Los Indignados protest movement held marches in scores of cities across Spain on Sunday, under the slogan \"\"From outrage to rebellion\" (more on this shortly) Something for finance ministers to ponder as they head to the Eurogroup.... I'll be tracking the latest events through the day....",

Sentiment towards eurozone peripheral sovereign debt remains remarkably benign despite the severity of the economic downturns across the region and the recent sell-off in core government bond markets. Central bank policy action continues to hold down Spanish and Italian borrowing costs even though the sustainability of the rally is being increasingly called into question. Despite evident tensions within Mr Letta's new coalition government and extremely bleak economic conditions, the resilience of Italy's sovereign bond market remains undiminished. However, demand at Spanish and Italian auctions has been somewhat lacklustre of late. Today's Italian sale was reflective of this trend but still a solid auction, with yields coming in further and the Treasury hitting the top end of its target.</p> <p>2. There's a growing acknowledgement on the part of many market participants that Spanish and Italian bond prices have become far too detached from fundamentals. Yet just because the rally appears way overdone doesn't mean that it's about to go into reverse. The \"reach for yield\" continues unabated and Spanish and Italian debt markets are among the biggest beneficiaries of this dramatic shift in investment behaviour.

Technically, we are equipped and ready to intervene.

Visco's 'unintended consequences' include the possibility that banks buy riskier government bonds, rather than leaving money in the central bank to suffer a small loss each night.</p> <p>Banks could also actually cut liquidity, rather than pushing more credit out into the eurozone economy.</p> <p><strong>But it's a complicated picture</strong>.

The central bank controls how much money there is in the system (using various ways, eg printing money, changing the reserve requirement etc) and the market only needs to decide the price of this money.</p> <p>The only way that lowering rates to the negative territory impacts the amount of cash in the system is because the central bank will be returning 99% of the money placed in it back to banks.</p> <p>But then which of the major central banks could even contemplate shrinking its balance sheet at the time when the global economy remains exceptionally fragile?</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Frances Coppola</strong>'s piece on <a href=\"http://coppolacomment.blogspot.co.uk/2012/12/the-strange-world-of-negative-interest.html\">the strange world of negative interest rates</a> remains a must read, too.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-05-13T09:18:00.847Z\">at 10.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5190a6e5e4b053aa3c6eb959\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-13T08:40:05.299Z\">9.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Wall Street Journal's Matina Stevis predicts few fireworks in Brussels today, as euro finance ministers take stock of the situation: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MatinaStevis/status/333862401994805248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Morning \u20ac watchers. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23eurogroup\">#eurogroup</a> today: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Greece\">#Greece</a> to get political ok for \u20ac7.5b in May and June. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23cyprus\">#cyprus</a> gets first \u20ac3b from bailout today <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23euro\">#euro</a></p>&mdash; Matina Stevis (@MatinaStevis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatinaStevis/status/333862401994805248\">May 13, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MatinaStevis/status/333862984608796672\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23eurogroup\">#eurogroup</a> will also hear from the Commission on macro forecasts.

The prospect of the US Federal Reserve ending its quantitative easing programme was also starting to be considered: much of the recent market gains have been helped by central bank intervention to boost the global economy, and any signs these measures are easing off are likely to cause renewed volatility.</p> <p>But better than expected US retail sales - showing a 0.1% rise in April rather than the forecast 0.3% fall - helped turn things around, and the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> ended the day marginally higher, up 6.78 points at 6631.76, yet another new five and a half year peak. The - now - eight day positive run is the best since June 2011.</p> <p><strong>G4S</strong> was the biggest riser in the leading index, up 8.4p at 256.1p as bargain hunters emerged after the company's recent declines. G4S has been boosted by news of a couple of UK government contracts as it tries to shed the legacy of its chaotic London Olympic performance.</p> <p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> climbed 15.5p to 1685.5p following news late on Friday that US regulators had approved Breo, a treatment for chronic pulmonary disease made in partnership with American group Theravance.</p> <p><strong>Rolls-Royce</strong> accelerated 16p to \u00a311.84 after JP Morgan Cazenove raised its target price from \u00a313 to \u00a314.20. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> We reiterate our view that Rolls is the highest quality company in the European aerospace and defence sector, based on its organic growth prospects, its best-in-class return on capital employed, and its relatively low risk profile. <br> </blockquote> <p>But banks were under pressure, with <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> down 30.5p to 1552.5p following a report that research group Muddy Waters was shorting its debt. The investment group's Carson Block said <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-12/carson-block-says-he-s-shorting-standard-chartered-debt.html\" title=\"\">he was concerned about the bank's deteriorating loan quality</a>, and said its loan book could come under stress when the Chinese economy slows down.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>HSBC</strong> lost 5.2p to 739.6p after Investec moved from buy to reduce.

      "bodyText": "For most of the day, it seemed as if the UK market's seven day winning streak was about to come to a halt. Disappointing Chinese industrial production figures made for a downbeat start to the day, giving investors the excuse to take some profits after recent rises. The prospect of the US Federal Reserve ending its quantitative easing programme was also starting to be considered: much of the recent market gains have been helped by central bank intervention to boost the global economy, and any signs these measures are easing off are likely to cause renewed volatility. But better than expected US retail sales - showing a 0.1% rise in April rather than the forecast 0.3% fall - helped turn things around, and the FTSE 100 ended the day marginally higher, up 6.78 points at 6631.76, yet another new five and a half year peak. The - now - eight day positive run is the best since June 2011. G4S was the biggest riser in the leading index, up 8.4p at 256.1p as bargain hunters emerged after the company's recent declines. G4S has been boosted by news of a couple of UK government contracts as it tries to shed the legacy of its chaotic London Olympic performance. GlaxoSmithKline climbed 15.5p to 1685.5p following news late on Friday that US regulators had approved Breo, a treatment for chronic pulmonary disease made in partnership with American group Theravance. Rolls-Royce accelerated 16p to \u00a311.84 after JP Morgan Cazenove raised its target price from \u00a313 to \u00a314.20. The bank said: We reiterate our view that Rolls is the highest quality company in the European aerospace and defence sector, based on its organic growth prospects, its best-in-class return on capital employed, and its relatively low risk profile. But banks were under pressure, with Standard Chartered down 30.5p to 1552.5p following a report that research group Muddy Waters was shorting its debt. The investment group's Carson Block said he was concerned about the bank's deteriorating loan quality, and said its loan book could come under stress when the Chinese economy slows down. Meanwhile HSBC lost 5.2p to 739.6p after Investec moved from buy to reduce. Analyst Ian Gordon said: We are perfectly comfortable with HSBC's first quarter 2013 financials - sharply lower impairments and an improving cost performance broadly offsetting weak revenues - but after the stock's recent outperformance we see limited further upside. Miners were mixed after the Chinese data, with Anglo American down 14p at \u00a315.77 and Vedanta Resources 19p lower at \u00a312.80. But Lonmin was lifted 7.2p to 286p after the platinum miner reported a better than expected first half profit of $54m, up from $18m and lifted its production guidance. The group has been hit by a wave of unrest and violence in South Africa, and warned that wage talks ahead presented a significant challenge. Among the mid-caps Ocado dropped 6.5% on concerns about the effect of its proposed tie-up with Morrisons on its existing deal with Waitrose. As the Guardian reported on Friday, lawyers for Waitrose are poring over its deal with Ocado to see if any move by the online grocer to help Morrisons set up a website would constitute breach of contract. The news followed a protest vote by shareholders at Ocado's annual meeting on Friday over board pay packages, including a 30% salary rise for chief executive Tim Steiner. Ocado's shares - which have been up sharply in recent days in anticipation of the Morrisons deal - fell 14.6p to 210p. Analyst Clive Black at Shore Capital repeated his sell recommendation, saying: We believe that Ocado is playing with fire in speaking to another British supermarket group, as it tries to utilise its substantially greater fulfilment capacity, because the group's umbilical cord to Waitrose may be cut sooner than we anticipated and Ocado cannot exist as a commercial entity without Waitrose in our view. But Flybe shares climbed more than 14% after the airline confirmed it was in talks about a sale of its 25 slots at Gatwick airport. Analysts said easyjet could be one of a number of airlines interested in the slots, which could fetch up to \u00a320m. Flybe ended 7.5p higher at 58.875p, although it cautioned there was no guarantee a deal would be done. Software group Instem, whose customers include GlaxoSmithKline and the US government, edged up 0.5p to 108p after unveiling the purchase of Logos Technologies, which specialises in technology for early stage clinical trials, for up to \u00a35m.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland could be poised to release potentially lucrative bonuses to a handful of top bankers from a share-based scheme put in place three years ago. The rewards are due to be handed to five members of Stephen Hester's management team on Tuesday \u2013 the same day as the bailed out bank's annual shareholders' meeting in Edinburgh. The size of the payments to the five \u2013 including the head of risk, Nathan Bostock, whose promotion to finance director was announced last week \u2013 will not be known for a number of days and will depend on the bank's share price and whether the performance criteria attached to the shares had been achieved. Theoretically, the payouts could amount to more than \u00a35m if all the performance targets are achieved, although it seems unlikely they will pay out in full. Hester, the chief executive, stood to receive shares worth \u00a32.5m \u2013 although he appears not to have hit the share price and financial performance targets attached to his potential rewards. According to a stock exchange announcement issued in 2010 when the shares were awarded to the RBS bankers, they are due to \"vest\" on 14 May although the bank will not need to announce the release of any shares yet. Hester, who has said that the bank will be ready for privatisation next year, announced more management changes on Monday with the recruitment of Simon McNamara from Standard Chartered to the position of chief administrative officer. He will replace Ron Teerlink whose intention to leave was announced last year. McNamara's role involves oversight of IT, something that has dogged the bank since the computer meltdown last June when customers were unable to access their accounts for days. The bankers who could cash in under the bonus scheme include Ellen Alemany, whose retirement from the helm of the US operation citizens was announced last week. The highest paid banker at RBS after receiving \u00a34.8m last year, she stands to receive up to \u00a31.8m from the three-year scheme. If all the performance targets are attained Bostock could receive \u00a31m, insurance head Paul Geddes \u00a3700,000, head of the business bank Chris Sullivan \u00a3800,000 and Teerlink \u00a3900,000 Bostock is replacing Bruce van Saun who is moving back to his native US to run Citizens and prepare the operation for a partial stock market flotation. The RBS annual meeting is taking place amid speculation about the government's plans for its share stake which could be sold off in a \"Tell Sid\" style offering to the public or through a free share handout proposed by some Liberal Democrats. However the banking standards commission, chaired by conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, is due to publish the findings of its nine-month review into the culture of banking next month and could recommend a breakup of RBS into a good and bad bank. It is the first AGM since RBS's computer problems in June, which forced Hester to waive his 2012 bonus, and the \u00a3390m fine for rigging Libor, which was announced in February.",

According to Bloomberg, the group's Carson Block said <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-12/carson-block-says-he-s-shorting-standard-chartered-debt.html\" title=\"\">he was concerned about the bank's deteriorating loan quality</a>, and said its loan book could come under stress when the Chinese economy slows down. He reportedly said at a conference in Las Vegas on Friday:</p> <blockquote> We think the market misunderstands the amount of risk that's presently in the book. <br> </blockquote> <p>He pointed to a $1bn loan to Samin Tan, the chairman of Bumi, the coal company at the centre of a dispute between co-founders Nathaniel Rothschild and Indonesia's Bakrie family.</p> <p>Meanwhile<strong> HSBC</strong> is 11.4p lower at 733.4p after Investec moved from buy to reduce. Analyst Ian Gordon said:</p> <blockquote> We are perfectly comfortable with HSBC's first quarter 2013 financials - sharply lower impairments and an improving cost performance broadly offsetting weak revenues - but after the stock's recent outperformance we see limited further upside. </blockquote> <p>Overall the FTSE 100 is down 21.65 points at 6603.33, not helped by disappointing Chinese industrial production figures. Investors have turned a little more cautious following recent strong market performances, including a five and a half year high on the FTSE 100. The prospect of the US Federal Reserve ending its quantitative easing programme is also starting to be considered: much of the recent gains have been helped by central bank intervention to boost the global economy, and any signs these measures could ease off are likely to unsettle the markets.</p> <p>Miners are mixed after the Chinese data, with <strong>Anglo American</strong> down 29.5p at 1561.5p and <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> 4.7p lower at 289.2p.</p> <p>But <strong>Lonmin</strong> has been lifted 15.4p to 294.2p after the platinum miner reported a better than expected first half profit of $54m, up from $18m and lifted its production guidance. The group has been hit by a wave of unrest and violence in South Africa, and warned that wage talks ahead presented a significant challenge.</p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> has climbed 19p to \u00a316.89 following news late on Friday that US regulators had approved Breo, a treatment for chronic pulmonary disease made in partnership with American group Theravance.</p> <p><strong>G4S</strong> has added 5.1p to 252.8p as bargain hunters emerged after the company's recent declines.

The bank is down 70p at \u00a315.13, a decline of more than 4%, following a report that research group Muddy Waters was shorting its debt. According to Bloomberg, the group's Carson Block said he was concerned about the bank's deteriorating loan quality, and said its loan book could come under stress when the Chinese economy slows down. He reportedly said at a conference in Las Vegas on Friday: We think the market misunderstands the amount of risk that's presently in the book. He pointed to a $1bn loan to Samin Tan, the chairman of Bumi, the coal company at the centre of a dispute between co-founders Nathaniel Rothschild and Indonesia's Bakrie family. Meanwhile HSBC is 11.4p lower at 733.4p after Investec moved from buy to reduce. Analyst Ian Gordon said: We are perfectly comfortable with HSBC's first quarter 2013 financials - sharply lower impairments and an improving cost performance broadly offsetting weak revenues - but after the stock's recent outperformance we see limited further upside. Overall the FTSE 100 is down 21.65 points at 6603.33, not helped by disappointing Chinese industrial production figures. Investors have turned a little more cautious following recent strong market performances, including a five and a half year high on the FTSE 100. The prospect of the US Federal Reserve ending its quantitative easing programme is also starting to be considered: much of the recent gains have been helped by central bank intervention to boost the global economy, and any signs these measures could ease off are likely to unsettle the markets. Miners are mixed after the Chinese data, with Anglo American down 29.5p at 1561.5p and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation 4.7p lower at 289.2p. But Lonmin has been lifted 15.4p to 294.2p after the platinum miner reported a better than expected first half profit of $54m, up from $18m and lifted its production guidance. The group has been hit by a wave of unrest and violence in South Africa, and warned that wage talks ahead presented a significant challenge. Elsewhere GlaxoSmithKline has climbed 19p to \u00a316.89 following news late on Friday that US regulators had approved Breo, a treatment for chronic pulmonary disease made in partnership with American group Theravance. G4S has added 5.1p to 252.8p as bargain hunters emerged after the company's recent declines. The company has won a couple of UK government contracts as it tries to shed the legacy of its chaotic London Olympic performance.",
