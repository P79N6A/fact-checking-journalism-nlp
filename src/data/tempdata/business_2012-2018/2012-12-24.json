      "bodyText": "Forget Boxing Day, the sales are on now. Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Currys/PC World have forgone tradition and will start their sales on Monday. M&amp;S began its online sale at noon on Christmas Eve, John Lewis kicked off its sale at 5pm and Currys/PC World at 7pm. M&amp;S has even bought the \"Christmas Eve sales\" search terms on Google in an attempt to attract shoppers. The dash for bargains will continue on Christmas Day, with online retailers predicting a record 82m visits, a 32% increase on last year, according to Experian. Amazon will begin its sale a day earlier than normal on Christmas Day at 9am. The last-minute dash to the high street is also expected to be much busier than in previous years. Many consumers were unable to finish all their shopping on 23 December \u2013 normally the busiest Christmas shopping day \u2013 because of Sunday trading laws limiting shops to just six hours trading. To get round the ban M&amp;S reopened more than 60 of its stores to allow customers to buy up essentials before Monday's crush of last-minute panic buyers. The high street will be at the busiest it has been all year at around lunchtime and early afternoon on Monday, according to experts at Ipsos Retail Performance (IPR), which measures shoppers footfall. \"This December we have seen unusual patterns of shopping activity and buyer behaviour which is now culminating in a mad dash to the shops by many consumers \u2013 and very possibly men \u2013 who have left some if not all of their gift buying for family and friends until the last minute,\" said Peter Luff, president of IPR. \"Over the past week, shoppers were out in their numbers across the UK, but the extra day ahead of Christmas will mean that many consumers will be out shopping for last-minute gifts and other items associated with the holiday season, such as food and drink.\" Luff said high street shopping activity for the past week is up 17% on the previous week, but is still 2.2% down on 2011. The British Retail Consortium said spending in the run-up to Christmas had been \"acceptable but not exceptional\". The retail industry trade association said spending over the final weekend before Christmas is expected to ring in at \u00a35bn. Waitrose said on Sunday it was its busiest ever Sunday shop, with twice as many customers flocking through the aisles as the previous Sunday. \"But [there's] still more shopping to do [on Monday], with many people unable to make it to the supermarket during shorter Sunday trading period \u2013 Waitrose expects Monday's sales to beat those of last Christmas Eve, despite last year's Christmas Eve falling on a Saturday.\" The supermarket said Waitrose lorries have delivered 1.4m cases of stock each day on the last weekend. Sainsbury's reported its busiest-ever hour in terms of customers served from midday to 1pm on Sunday, while 35 branches opened at midnight and will trade until 6pm on Monday. A million visitors were expected in London's West End during the three-day period from Saturday to Monday, during which more than \u00a3100m was expected to be spent. The Bluewater shopping centre in Kent was also anticipating a surge in sales on Monday as Saturday's footfall was up 14% from the previous week. However, almost 140 firms are facing the threat of closure, according to restructuring firm Begbies Traynor. Richard Dodd, of the BRC, said there would \"undoubtedly\" be more high street chains that fail to cling on after Christmas. The creeping forward of Christmas sales to Christmas Day and before has alarmed Church leaders. Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey said: \"Christmas Day is a time to be together with the family, to focus on the children and to have a great time together. This day is precious.

      "bodyText": "Consumers are braced for another year of austerity after the chancellor's autumn statement failed to lift the gloom that has descended on the UK economy. According to a survey this month of attitudes to family finances, 43% of households believe their finances will worsen in 2013, compared with 24% who expect their income to improve. George Osborne was forced to admit in his autumn statement that growth would be lower than expected, but said he planned to boost investment and the long-term prospects for the economy. However the survey by Markit, the financial data provider, found that \"the underlying situation is that household finances are under severe strain from lower incomes and higher living costs\". More households were fearful of losing their jobs than in the previous month, and most expected wage rises to remain below inflation, according to the report. On balance all five income bands in the Markit household index were pessimistic about the coming year. Regional data showed that households in Wales were the most pessimistic, those in the south-west the least downbeat. Days after official figures showed growth in the economy was slower than initially thought in the third quarter, news that households are braced for a bleak 2013 will dismay the Treasury, which has based much of its economic strategy on a resurgence in consumer spending. Without a strong rise in consumer demand, a promised return to growth in the latter part of 2013 could fail to materialise. Firms have held back investments on new plant and machinery until recently and could mothball plans if they see consumers closing their purses and wallets. Begbies Traynor, the insolvency firm, said about 140 high street shop chains were vulnerable to going bankrupt this year if an expected upturn in spending failed to materialise. It said the shops, which are heavily indebted after a borrowing binge in the boom years, faced significant financial distress if austerity-hit shoppers continued to bargain-hunt and switch to online shopping. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \"Households are bracing themselves for yet another year of squeezed personal finances in 2013. The vast majority of households anticipate that their financial wellbeing will either worsen or stagnate next year. \"With three-quarters of all households not expecting any improvement in their finances, the latest survey suggests that domestic consumer demand will remain under pressure in the near term, especially since inflation perceptions remain elevated and job insecurities are prevalent.\" Concerns of a growing north/south were borne out by a house price survey by Hometrack, which showed prices rising in most districts across the capital and much of the south-west while the Midlands and the north experienced declines. Hometrack said the movement in prices was small but were part of a longer-term trend. It said the picture for 2013 would be much the same as 2012, with prices across the country edging down 1% as the London market shows signs of cooling. Hometrack predicts that a reluctance by struggling families to take on more debt will continue to act as a drag on the housing market next year and prices will be more volatile, with continued low sales. One in five postcodes in England and Wales recorded price increases over the past year but prices have fallen across two-thirds of the country. London has had strong demand from wealthy overseas buyers and consistently outperforms other regions, seeing prices rise in seven out of 10 postcodes this year. Property prices are now 10% higher than at the peak of the market in 2007. But price growth in London is predicted to slow over the next year, with a 2% annual increase pencilled in. Hometrack said about 912,000 sales should take place next year, well below the Council of Mortgage Lenders forecast that transactions will pick up to around 950,000.",

Hometrack predicts that a reluctance by struggling families to take on more debt will continue to act as a drag on the housing market next year and prices will be more volatile, with continued low sales.</p> <p>One in five postcodes in England and Wales recorded price increases over the past year but prices have fallen across two-thirds of the country. London has had strong demand from wealthy overseas buyers and consistently outperforms other regions, seeing prices rise in seven out of 10 postcodes this year. Property prices are now 10% higher than at the peak of the market in 2007.</p> <p>But price growth in London is predicted to slow over the next year, with a 2% annual increase pencilled in. Hometrack said about 912,000 sales should take place next year, well below the Council of Mortgage Lenders forecast that transactions will pick up to around 950,000.</p>",
