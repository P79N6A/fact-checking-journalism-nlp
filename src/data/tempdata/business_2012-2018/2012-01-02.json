      "body": "<p>Industry leaders have warned that mass discounting failed to kickstart a recovery on Britain's high streets this Christmas, with total sales likely to be lower than last year once inflation is taken into account.</p> <p>The gloomy prognosis came as a thinktank predicted that the UK would be sucked into a Europe-wide recession in 2012, with at least one country expected to exit the eurozone.</p> <p>After a festive period that has seen footwear chain Barratts Priceless axe 1,600 jobs and retail chains La Senza and D2 Jeans enter administration, the British Retail Consortium admitted that an unseasonably mild Christmas had not dispelled the economic chill on Britain's high streets.</p> <p>The trade body's monthly Retail Sales Monitor, to be published on 10 January, will show that despite heavy discounting in the run-up to Christmas, the total value of sales is barely up on December 2010. If November's consumer prices inflation of 4.8% is stripped out of that number, it would mean that sales fell in real terms as fewer goods were shifted, the BRC added.</p> <p>\"We are not very optimistic that growth will be significant, and if you include inflation it will almost certainly be down on last year,\" said a BRC spokeswoman. \"Last December was badly affected by the snow so there was even more reason to hope this December would look good by comparison.</p> <p>However, Christmas shopping started very late this year and there was a remarkably high level of discounting in advance of Christmas itself.\"</p> <p>Consumer caution is exacting a heavy toll on the retail industry, one of the cornerstones of a services sector that accounts for 75% of the British economy.</p> <p>Belt-tightening has toppled a number of familiar high street names, with lingerie chain La Senza announcing the closure of 80 of its stores at the weekend and outdoor clothing retailer Blacks Leisure expected to enter administration in the coming days.</p> <p>D2 jeans folded last week, as did toy and gift chain Hawkin's Bazaar, citing \"exceptionally challenging trading conditions\". Administrators at Barratts Priceless made 1,610 employees redundant on Friday after it failed to find a buyer for its concessions business.</p> <p>And investors are nervously awaiting Christmas trading news from HMV. The music and entertainment retailer has debts of \u00a3160m and has warned tough trading conditions \"cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern in the future\".</p> <p>Snow kept shoppers away in 2010, when the total value of sales was up just 1.5% on the year before, stoking hopes that better weather and a sales drive would produce a clear improvement on the 2010 total.</p> <p>However, it became apparent last month that big discounts were not overcoming consumer worries. Shops were so concerned about the lack of spending this December that two-thirds of retailers were putting up the sale signs 10 days before Christmas, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p> <p>The research firm Verdict predicts that retail sales will grow by just 1.2% during 2012, up \u00a33.5bn to a total of \u00a3295.3bn. It means that 2012 will be the third weakest retail year in four decades, only beating 2009 and 2011.</p> <p>The bleak outlook on British high streets will be replicated across the UK economy, the Centre for Economics and Business Research warns today.

      "bodyText": "Industry leaders have warned that mass discounting failed to kickstart a recovery on Britain's high streets this Christmas, with total sales likely to be lower than last year once inflation is taken into account. The gloomy prognosis came as a thinktank predicted that the UK would be sucked into a Europe-wide recession in 2012, with at least one country expected to exit the eurozone. After a festive period that has seen footwear chain Barratts Priceless axe 1,600 jobs and retail chains La Senza and D2 Jeans enter administration, the British Retail Consortium admitted that an unseasonably mild Christmas had not dispelled the economic chill on Britain's high streets. The trade body's monthly Retail Sales Monitor, to be published on 10 January, will show that despite heavy discounting in the run-up to Christmas, the total value of sales is barely up on December 2010. If November's consumer prices inflation of 4.8% is stripped out of that number, it would mean that sales fell in real terms as fewer goods were shifted, the BRC added. \"We are not very optimistic that growth will be significant, and if you include inflation it will almost certainly be down on last year,\" said a BRC spokeswoman. \"Last December was badly affected by the snow so there was even more reason to hope this December would look good by comparison. However, Christmas shopping started very late this year and there was a remarkably high level of discounting in advance of Christmas itself.\" Consumer caution is exacting a heavy toll on the retail industry, one of the cornerstones of a services sector that accounts for 75% of the British economy. Belt-tightening has toppled a number of familiar high street names, with lingerie chain La Senza announcing the closure of 80 of its stores at the weekend and outdoor clothing retailer Blacks Leisure expected to enter administration in the coming days. D2 jeans folded last week, as did toy and gift chain Hawkin's Bazaar, citing \"exceptionally challenging trading conditions\". Administrators at Barratts Priceless made 1,610 employees redundant on Friday after it failed to find a buyer for its concessions business. And investors are nervously awaiting Christmas trading news from HMV. The music and entertainment retailer has debts of \u00a3160m and has warned tough trading conditions \"cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern in the future\". Snow kept shoppers away in 2010, when the total value of sales was up just 1.5% on the year before, stoking hopes that better weather and a sales drive would produce a clear improvement on the 2010 total. However, it became apparent last month that big discounts were not overcoming consumer worries. Shops were so concerned about the lack of spending this December that two-thirds of retailers were putting up the sale signs 10 days before Christmas, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. The research firm Verdict predicts that retail sales will grow by just 1.2% during 2012, up \u00a33.5bn to a total of \u00a3295.3bn. It means that 2012 will be the third weakest retail year in four decades, only beating 2009 and 2011. The bleak outlook on British high streets will be replicated across the UK economy, the Centre for Economics and Business Research warns today. In its top 10 predictions for 2012 the thinktank says it expects a \"modest to severe\" recession in the west, although this could exclude the US. The UK will not be so lucky, adds the CEBR, with the possibility that Britain has already been through the first of two quarters of economic contraction. \"Depending on how the euro is managed, European GDP will decline by between 0.6% and 2%. The UK will also probably hit a temporary recession \u2013 this could well be happening right now in Q4 2011 and Q1 2012,\" says the CEBR. It adds that by the end of this year \"at least one\" country will leave the euro, with analysts nominating Greece as the overwhelming favourite for an exit.",
