      "bodyText": "Network Rail\u2019s five-year plan for what the government trumpeted as \u201cthe biggest investment in rail since Victorian times\u201d is going seriously off track, the regulator has warned, with major works afflicted by soaring costs and delays, and only a fraction of planned renewal works completed on target. A review this summer is likely to see major electrification projects shelved until the next decade as escalating costs add billions to the bill. The Office of Rail and Road said it would be a \u201cvery tall order\u201d to deliver the \u00a338bn plan, and that passengers would be feeling the impact through poorer train services. Network Rail on Thursday also published annual accounts showing its debt has risen by almost \u00a35bn in a year to \u00a337.8bn. Despite political and regulatory pressure to cut costs, spending in many areas has increased, leaving other schemes in the firing line. The electrification of the Midland mainline \u2013 described by Network Rail as \u201ccritical to delivering a reliable and sustainable railway and tackling overcrowding\u201d on the line from London to Sheffield \u2013 could now be axed. The ORR report showed that more than a third of the \u201cmilestones\u201d in major enhancement projects had been missed, failing to reach 30 out of 84 targets in the first year of the 2014-19 plan. The regulator said \u201cthe high number of missed milestones has raised serious questions about Network Rail\u2019s ability to deliver future projects on time\u201d. Fewer than one in four of the renewals to overhead lines scheduled for this year have been carried out, and only a third of signalling works. Despite the backlog, Network Rail will also miss its budgetary targets by \u00a3430m. Richard Price, the chief executive of ORR, said that Network Rail had \u201csystemic issues\u201d, including wide discrepancies in how it measured its work and kept track of the state of the railway, as well as problems in planning and management structures \u2013 issues it had tried to deny in the past. Price said that Mark Carne, who took over as Network Rail\u2019s chief executive a year ago, \u201crecognises all of these points\u201d. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant step up in Network Rail\u2019s candour on these points but what we need to see is evidence of efficiency in addressing these areas.\u201d The report underlines problems at Network Rail that have caused consternation in Whitehall since the rail infrastructure owner and operator\u2019s burgeoning debt came onto the government\u2019s balance sheet last September. Annual results published on Thursday showed the debt had risen to \u00a337.8bn from just under \u00a333bn in 2014. Patrick McLoughin, the transport secretary, is understood to be resisting pressure from the Treasury to explore a possible break-up and privatisation of Network Rail, but on Thursday he refused to rule it out in response to questions in the Commons. The budget for electrification of the Great Western mainline has leapt 50% to \u00a31.8bn, from an initial estimate of \u00a31.2bn, with well-placed industry sources fearing increases of a similar scale are likely on other upgrades. Network Rail said it had \u201crecognised the scale of the challenge and has been openly reporting performance data regularly\u201d. \u201cThere are clearly opportunities to improve following decades of under-investment in the rail network. However, it is worth highlighting that we operate the safest passenger network in Europe and the railway asset reliability is the best it has ever been.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That is all for tonight, I reckon. Thanks as ever. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. GW Despite the rising tensions, Tsipras is still smiling tonight: Finance minister Varoufakis is also at the ERT bash: Alexis Tsipras is back in Athens tonight, and unwinding at public broadcaster ERT, which reopened today. Here\u2019s a video clip from the IMF\u2019s press briefing today, where top spokesman Gerry Rice dropped the bombshell news that the Fund\u2019s negotiators are heading back to Washington. Our economics editor Larry Elliott sums up the state of play this evening, as only Larry can: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?\u201d The lines spoken by Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry sprang to mind when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that it had called its Greek negotiating team home from talks in Brussels. The IMF\u2019s message was short and brutal. There were still major differences between Greece and its creditors. There was no progress in narrowing those differences. The two sides were well away from an agreement. So much, then, for the talk earlier this week that a deal is close. Shares across Europe surged on hopes that a resolution to the crisis was at hand, but that optimism was punctured by the news from Washington. The IMF, clearly, has had enough. It was unimpressed by Greece\u2019s decision to bundle up all four of the debt repayments due this month and is frustrated by the unwillingness of Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, to cross its two \u201cred line\u201d issues \u2013 pensions and labour-market reform. This, then, is the IMF holding the gun to Alexis Tsipras\u2019s head. It feels like a pivotal moment, the point where the creditors are saying \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d and the Greeks have to decide whether the IMF really means it.... Here\u2019s his full analysis: IMF to Alexis Tsipras: \u2018Do you feel lucky, punk?\u2019 Anti-austerity protesters are demonstrating outside the Greek parliament in Athens tonight. The march has been organised by the Communist-affiliated trade union PAME, whose supporters took over the finance ministry this morning. It\u2019s a reminder that Alexis Tsipras will faces opposition at home if he agrees to the tax rises and pension reforms demanded by lenders: After a bruising day, Greece has been shown some support, by Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff attended this week\u2019s EU-Latin American Summit in Brussels, where she met Alexis Tsipras this morning. And speaking afterwards, the left-winger warned that creditors can drive a country into bankruptcy if they are too demanding. Rousseff said (via AFP): \u201cThe Greek prime minister spoke about his difficulties, which are public and well known. We know it\u2019s tough -- we had to wait 20 years for growth,\u201d . \u201cAll austerity measures involve two sides, and one side imposes a measure which the country implements until they go bankrupt. We think of the example of Argentina at the end of the 1990s.\u201d Argentina famously defaulted on its debts at the end of 2001, after an IMF-led bailout and austerity package had led to a deep recession. It is still fighting investors who hold legacy debt, and who insist on being repaid in full. Another twist tonight....Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commissioner for the Euro, has declared that a deal can still be reached. Even though the IMF have hauled their officials back to Washington, Dombrovskis believes that Greece and her lenders still have time. Speaking in Madrid, Dombrovskis told reporters: \u201cNegotiations are continuing on a technical level,\u201d \u201cProgress is possible and (an) agreement is possible. It really requires political will.\u201d And \u2018political will\u2019 is a coded way of telling Alexis Tsipras to offer a proposal that its creditors can accept. Dombrovskis was speaking alongside Spain\u2019s economy minister Luis De Guindos; he also offered an optimistic view: If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story explaining the latest dramatic developments around Greece\u2019s bailout negotiations: The IMF\u2019s withdrawal has come as a rather nasty shock to Greece, where optimism had been building that a compromise might be close. Media reports are calling the move a \u201cmegaton bomb\u201d dropped on Athens by its creditors. And Helena Smith reports that you can already hear the cries of demonstrators denouncing the \u201cnew memorandum\u201d (bailout agreement) wafting through central Athens, as tonight\u2019s protests get underway. As we covered earlier, communist protestors have already occupied the finance ministry this morning, in a show of defiance against further austerity measures. Get serious and we\u2019ll come back. That\u2019s the message from the IMF tonight.... Over in Athens the government spokesman has just announced that the Greek negotiating team is \u201cready\u201d to intensify efforts to wrap up a deal \u201ceven in the next 24 hours.\u201d They add: \u201cFor that reason it will continue to work on the unresolved issues such as the fiscal and debt sustainability.\u201d (via Helena Smith) Is this a sign that Greece is caving in, and has got the message from Europe and the IMF? Although the Fund has left the field, the Euro Working Group will be holding a informal meeting in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia tomorrow. They\u2019ll be preparing for next week\u2019s eurogroup meeting of finance minister. The IMF\u2019s decision to pull its officials out of the talks with Greece has alarmed seasoned eurozone crisis watchers. With Greece\u2019s bailout expiring in under three weeks, it feels like creditors\u2019 patience has expired, with just a few days to resolve the crisis: So much for those claims that Germany was ready to compromise.... The Financial Times has learned that Berlin has been warning this week that they wouldn\u2019t be willing to make concessions to Athens; last week\u2019s deal is the best on offer. Here\u2019s the story: Greece\u2019s bailout creditors signal that talks over aid are at an end And here\u2019s a flavour: The German government has privately been sending signals in recent days intimating that it was time to cut off talks and adopt a harder-line, \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d approach to the talks. According to three senior eurozone officials, German leaders have told other eurozone capitals they are no longer willing to negotiate beyond a compromise deal presented to Mr Tsipras last week by Mr Juncker on behalf of Greece\u2019s creditors. Officials said Mr Tsipras\u2019 strident rejection of the proposal before the Greek parliament on Friday, coupled by his governments attempt to renegotiate budget surplus targets that creditors thought they had agreed to, has hardened Berlin\u2019s stance. \u201cThe only answer they\u2019re looking for from the Greeks is to say \u2018yes\u2019, said one eurozone official. EU officials are briefing that the meeting between Tsipras and Juncker today was a final throw of the dice to get a deal agreed. One diplomatic explained to Reuters: \u201cIf the process was working properly the president would not have had to have a meeting with Tsipras today. President Juncker made a last attempt to make a deal possible.\u201d Traders in Athens must be biting through their pens in anger -- the IMF statement hit the wires just after the Greek stock market closed, having surged by 8%! I fear it\u2019s going to tumble back tomorrow... European stock markets had been surging ahead today, with the German DAX up another 1.5%. But the news that the IMF\u2019s negotiators are heading home has sent shares sliding: Serious news from Washington. The International Monetary Fund has announced that its negotiating team in Brussels is heading home! Spokesman Gerry Rice has just told reporters that there are still \u201cmajor differences\u201d between the IMF and Greece on key issues, including pension reforms and tax rates. Bloomberg has the story: The IMF said that its team negotiating with Greece has left Brussels after failing to make progress on a debt deal that would help the country to avoid default. \u201cThe ball is very much in Greece\u2019s court,\u201d International Monetary Fund spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters at a media briefing in Washington on Thursday. \u201cThere are major differences between us in most key areas. There has been no progress in narrowing these differences recently,\u201d he said. The IMF\u2019s decision to withdraw its team comes amid increasingly sharp criticism from creditors at the Greek government\u2019s continued refusal to bow to their demands, risking a default and ultimately an exit from the euro common currency. IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde will attend a meeting of euro-area finance ministers in Luxembourg on June 18, Rice said. \u201cAs our managing director has said many times, the IMF never leaves the table,\u201d he said. Another sign that creditors are losing patience with Greece. The FT\u2019s Peter Spiegel has read between the lines of Juncker\u2019s comments -- he has told Tsipras that it\u2019s time to get that deal sorted. That echoes Donald Tusk\u2019s warning at lunchtime -- that the time for talking is over. Just seeing some quotes from Jean-Claude Juncker too! He says today\u2019s meeting with Alexis Tsipras was \u201cImportant, Interesting and Friendly\u201d. The Commission president also reveals that he explained a possible process which Tsipras could pursue to reach a mutually acceptable deal in time. The two leaders will stay in \u201cclose contact\u201d over the coming days, Juncker added. Does that mean we could see a deal early next week, in time for the Eurogroup meeting on the June 18th? Alexis Tsipras has spoken briefly to a reporter has he left his meeting with Juncker. The Greek PM said he is seeking a deal that means Greece\u2019s debts will be \u201cviable\u201d in future, while also guaranteeing social cohesion. That\u2019s similar to his statement last night, after meeting Merkel and Hollande. Reporters in Brussels say that Alexis Tsipras\u2019s meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker has now ended, after around two hours.... One regular blog reader, James Wilkins, emails some thoughts on Donald Tusk\u2019s comments from Greece\u2019s second city, Thessaloniki: Am still not sure that Greeks will accept more bullying. Sitting here trying to work, with the sunlight streaming through the windows, it seems unreal that foreign powers think they have the right to rob ordinary Greeks of almost everything except the sunlight. I have followed this crisis first hand and often in this blog. To begin with it was with a feeling of dismay, then disbelief and now with fury....and I am not Greek! What gambling does Tusk refer to? Whether Greeks should hold out for a second crust of bread or be content with one? Does the future of the Eurozone depend on that? The Greek stock market is hitting new highs, up 8% now as optimism builds.... The Tsipras-Juncker meeting is now underway. Let\u2019s see if it produces the progress that Donald Tusk is demanding... Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, has intervened in the Greek bailout crisis by declaring that Europe needs to see a deal now. Unless an agreement comes imminently, there is a risk that someone will decide enough is enough next week, Turk warned, in a pointed signal to prime minister Alexis Tsipras. Speaking at the closing press conference for the EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit, Tusk says that there is no more time for gambling, or negotiations. Now is the time to decide. \u201cIt is very obvious that we need decisions, not negotiations.\u201d \u201cThere is no more time for gambling. The day is coming, I\u2019m afraid, that someone says that the game is over.\u201d Next week\u2019s eurogroup meeting, on 18 June, is really crucial, Tusk added. That eurogroup meeting is the next opportunity for eurozone finance ministers to sign off any Greek deal. From the look on Tusk\u2019s face, he\u2019ll be furious if the opportunity is missed. Brussels experts agree that it\u2019s a powerful and unusual move from Tusk. As I type, Tsipras should be sitting down with Jean-Claude Juncker to discuss the crisis. Might Tusk\u2019s intervention make a difference?... The Greek stock market is absolutely surging today as optimism sweeps the trading floors in Athens. Bank shares are rocketing ahead, as investors anticipate progress in Brussels to unlock aid for Greece in time. The main ATG index is up over 7%, on track for its best day since February. And bank share have rallied by as much as 17%: Yesterday\u2019s report that Germany was prepared to allow Greece to stagger its reforms is clearly still boosting confidence. And Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann\u2019s concerns about Greek insolvency risks may also be pushing shares up. As covered earlier, Weidmann warned that the contagion potentially caused by Greece shouldn\u2019t be \u201cunderestimated\u201d. That could be a warning to those in Europe who believe Grexit is containable. It\u2019s quite a rally, given last night\u2019s meeting between Tsipras, Merkel and Hollande didn\u2019t deliver a deal; just a pledge that efforts will intensify. As Brenda Kelly of London Capital Markets puts it: It merely looks like talks have \u2018intensified\u2019 which ultimately leaves us exactly where we were and makes one wonder whether Greece will manage to fudge a deal at this point at all. There is no deal just an agreement that a viable solution needs to be found. Greece\u2019s national economy minister Giorgos Stathakis has revealed that any new deal eventually carved out for debt-stricken Greece will include increased taxes. That\u2019s a first for a sitting politician representing the governing radical left Syriza. Helena Smith reports Speaking to state-run TV\u2019s newly relaunched channel, ERT, Stathakis gave a glimpse of what Athens\u2019 new agreement with creditors will entail for Greeks. The deal, he said, would give the green light to privatisations (once a red rag for the leftists) and emergency levies on mid-income salaries. Publicly-owned assets put up for sale would range from the port of Piraeus to the railway network, TrainOSE and regional airports nationwide. An almost watertight blackout by negotiators on the workings of what in effect is expected to be a new financial lifeline for Greece, has spawned widespread speculation but little in the way of specifics. The measures will mean prime minister Alexis Tsipras rolling back on seminal pre-election pledges. The leader is counting on his unrivalled popularity ratings and widespread support for his Syriza party to carry him through. The news of the concessions were revealed as Greece\u2019s council of state, the highest court in the land, announced that 800,000 pensioners had been wrongfully deprived of earnings when Athens\u2019 former left-right government imposed cuts on pensions of employees in state-run utilities and the private sector back in 2012. The lost earnings are estimated at as much as \u20ac1.5bn which the government will now have to find. Stathakis was among a host of government ministers who spoke to ERT on the premier day of its relaunch exactly two years to the day after it was abruptly closed down. Prime minister Alexis Tsipras had made reinstatement of the channel - which had remorphed as Nerit in late 2013 - a major pre-election pledge. A lot of Greek officials are locked out of the finance ministry today, as today\u2019s anti-austerity protests continue. Protestors currently occupying the building are exhorting passers-by to join tonight\u2019s mass rally, which kicks off at 7.30pm local time. On the first floor, one individual has a megaphone and is chanting: \u201cEnough of memoranda, new measures and poverty\u201d Jan Strupczewski, Reuters\u2019 deputy bureau chief in Brussels, is hearing encouraging noises from EU officials. He writes: Greece and its creditors could reach a deal in their cash-for-reforms talks next week, in time for the next meeting of euro zone finance ministers, the Eurogroup, on June 18, a senior EU official told Reuters on Thursday. Talks between Greece and the institutions -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission -- would continue on Thursday with a focus on Greek pension reforms, value added tax rates and primary surplus targets, officials familiar with the talks said. \u201cAll that and more will be on the table. I don\u2019t think there will be a breakthrough yet today, but I think there is a good chance that next week will bring an agreement that can be endorsed by the Eurogroup,\u201d the senior official said. Newsflash from Brussels. Alexis Tsipras and Jean-Claude Juncker will meet at 1pm BST (2pm local time). Greece has not, and will not, cave in over its creditors demand for a 1% primary budget surplus this year. So says finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, in the Athens parliament a few minutes ago. He told MPs that Greece is standing firm, even though these surplus targets are one crucial area of disagreement. Greece had originally proposed a surplus of just 0.6%, arguing that larger savings would be counter-productive, but then raised it to 0.75% Varoufakis insisted that rumours that Greece might accept the 1% target, though, are wrong: \u201cWe have not under any circumstances agreed to 1 percent for this year as it was reported. This kind of approach is part of the problem and not the solution and we are not going to sign this.\u201d Greece also has a massive long-term unemployment problem: Greece\u2019s unemployment rate has surged back up, in a grim reminder of how Greece\u2019s economy has worsened this year as the bailout crisis has escalated. The Greek jobless rate jumped to 26.6% in the first quarter of the year, up from 26.1% in October-December. The number of people in work decreased by 0.9% compared with the previous quarter, while the unemployment total rose by 2.1%. That\u2019s not a shock, given Greece also lurched back into recession this year. But it shows the perilous state of its economy now, with young people suffering particularly badly. Alexis Tsipras has faced a tricky audience this morning \u2013 Finland\u2019s new prime minister, Juha Sipil\u00e4. Sipil\u00e4\u2019s coalition includes the eurosceptic True Finns party, who are opposed to any fresh help for Greece, and believe it should leave the euro. Meanwhile, Greece is bracing for a series of strike rallies today by unions aligned with the country\u2019s orthodox communist party KKE. This morning\u2019s protest at the finance ministry [see here for photos] are just the start, as the Pame union urges prime minister Tsipras not to sign up for a new bailout: From Athens, Helena Smith reports. Some 700 unions, associations and labour organisations will take to the streets in 59 towns across Greece today in the first big show of protest against the new loan agreement the Syriza-led government is hammering out with international creditors. Rallies will be held in towns big and small, from north to south, on islands and the mainland, according to Pame, the party\u2019s militant trade union. A massive demonstration has been scheduled for 7:30pm (5.30pm BST) outside the finance ministry in Athens where streets are already emblazoned with billboards and posters urging people to participate. This is the first major display of opposition to what hard left-wingers describe as another \u201cmemorandum\u201d with all the onerous terms that every other bailout accord has carried for Greece. The union said: \u201cThe executive secretariat of Pame calls on all trade unions, labour organisations and working classes to respond en masse, combatively and decisively to the new memorandum that is being prepared by both the government and institutions (EU, IMF, ECB...)... \u201c[And] to take a fighting position against the new measures that are being prepared which will tear apart what little labour rights have remained.\u201d Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, has warned that the dangers of Greece going bust are increasing every day: In a speech this morning, Weidmann warned that central banks risk being overburdened by the demands placed on them. He cites the emergency liquidity assistance which the ECB is providing as one example where monetary policy is being stretched: It is clear that monetary policy can stimulate the economy in the short run. What it cannot do, however, is deliver sustainable growth. Metaphorically speaking, if you have a rowing boat and one of the oars is broken, it is better to try to fix that oar than to paddle with the remaining one. Weidmann, one of the hawkish voices on the ECB\u2019s governing council, warns that Greece\u2019s people would suffer most if the crisis exploded. But he also cautioned against believing that Grexit wouldn\u2019t pose serious consequences. There is a strong determination to help Greece improve its public administration, remove barriers to growth and put public finances on a sustainable path. And taxpayers from other euro-area countries have provided substantial funds to support the unavoidable adjustment processes. But time is running out, and the risk of insolvency is increasing by the day. The contagion effects of such a scenario are certainly better contained than they were in the past, though they should not be underestimated. But the main losers in that scenario would be Greece and the Greek people. What I would like to stress here is that an erosion of the principles of monetary union also has consequences for the Eurosystem and the monetary union that no one should downplay. Here\u2019s the full speech We have a winner: A small prize for whoever can translate Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s words of wisdom: Angela Merkel has told reporters that she, Francois Hollande and Alexis Tsipras agreed that Greece will work \u201cintensively and with high pressure\u201d in the days ahead, at last night\u2019s talks. Reuters has the details: Greece told its European partners that it was committed to intense discussions with its creditors to solve all open issues and avoid a looming default at the end of the month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday. \u201cAt the end of the talks there was absolute unanimity that Greece will work intensively and with high pressure with the three institutions in the coming days to solve all open issues,\u201d Merkel told reporters after arriving for a meeting between EU and Latin American leaders. Allianz\u2019s chief economic adviser, Mohamed El-Erian, fears the Greek crisis could damage the European Central bank\u2019s reputation and finances, given it is now providing \u20ac82bn of emergency support to Greece\u2019s banks And speaking on Bloomberg TV, El-Erian warned that policymakers are \u201closing control of the situation on the ground\u201d Even if you come up with even another bandaid, this isn\u2019t a problem that is going to be resolved any time soon. Another busy morning for Alexis Tsipras. He\u2019s now held a meeting with the first vice-president of Cuba, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, as the EU-Latin American summit continues. Greek bank share are soaring ahead today, as optimism ripples through the Athens stock market: You can keep track of all Greece\u2019s debt repayments in the coming months, in our nifty tracker: European stock markets are all up in early trading, led by the German DAX (0.7%). Traders appear confident that some deal will be reached with Greece, despite the lack of clear signs of progress last night. And the main Greek stock index has surged by 5.5% in early trading. Athens investors are reacting to yesterday\u2019s Bloomberg report that Germany was apparently open to a \u2018staggered\u2019 deal, in which Greece would receive funds if they agree one reform deal. Moritz Kraemer, chief rating officer of Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, has also identified the \u20ac3.5bn ECB repayment on July 20 as the key date for Greece and its creditors. Last night, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s cut Greece\u2019s credit rating by one notch to CCC, just two places above default, and warned that the country\u2019s liquidity position continues to deteriorate. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a few minute ago, Kraemer said that Greece wouldn\u2019t officially default if it failed to repay the International Monetary Fund on June 30, as the IMF isn\u2019t a commercial creditor. However, failing to repay the European Central Bank would have very serious consequences.. The real deadline is in July when Greece must repay the money it owes to the ECB. If they miss that payment, my expectation is it would be impossible for the ECB to continue providing emergency liquidity to the Greek banking sector. But as flagged earlier, any deal could take several weeks to implement, before funds are handed over. Yesterday, the ECB agreed to provide another \u20ac2.3bn of liquidity to Greece\u2019s banks, to help them stay afloat. But, Kraemer argues, the ECB might be forced to reassess the situation if it doesn\u2019t get its own money back next month. If you subtract all the Greek government debt that Greek banks hold, their solvency is questionable. July 20th is emerging as the new hard deadline for Greece That\u2019s the date when it must return \u20ac3.5bn to the European Central Bank. And writing in the FT this morning, Peter Spiegel explains that officials fear serious trouble if the payment is missed: Officials are hoping to reach an agreement by next week\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers to ensure the \u20ac7.2bn tranche can be disbursed before a \u20ac3.5bn Greek government bond comes due on July 20. Eurozone officials believe it will take a month for Greece to legislate and implement the reform programme, and a default on the July 20 bond, held by the European Central Bank, could spark financial chaos in the country, officials believe. Although Greece\u2019s current bailout ends at the end of the month, a deal reached by next week could include a programme extension so that bailout tranches could be paid into July. More here: Leaders fail to reach deal on Greek aid Here\u2019s more quotes from Pierre Moscovici\u2019s interview this morning, via Reuters: \u201cGreece must make more efforts to provide a list of reforms so that their economy can be more solid and so that they can fulfill their commitments to their creditors. \u201cI am convinced that divergences have now been narrowed enough so that in the days to come we can intensify our work and reach the outcome we all want.\u201d Ructions in Athens this morning. Members of the Communist-affiliated PAME Union have occupied the finance ministry in an anti-austerity demonstration. They\u2019ve hung a huge banner on the building, showing Tsipras alongside his two predecessors - plus some menacing cigar-toting heavies representing the European Central Bank. European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici hasn\u2019t given up hopes of a breakthrough between Greece and creditors. Speaking on RTL Radio, Moscovici urged negotiators to intensify the work. \u201cI really like Greek tragedy but now we must move to the happy ending\u201d Despite the months of deadlock, Moscovici reckons the splits can be resolved in time. \u201cWe are close to the landing strip. There is political will, we can and must succeed.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout talks and other events across the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Just 20 days to go until Greece\u2019s bailout expires, and we still don\u2019t have a deal. European leaders are gathering in Brussels again today, to conclude the EU-Latin American Summit, and Greek issues will surely be discussed on the sidelines again. That will include another meeting between prime minister Alexis Tsipras and Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. Tsipras is back at work already, meeting the leader of Brazil: As we covered last last night (yawn), the leaders of Germany, France and Greece discussed the crisis for two hours last night. But rather than a big breakthough, they only agreed that talks must \u201cintensify\u201d. Alexis Tsipras told reporters afterwards that: \u201cI think the EU leadership realises they must agree to a viable solution and a possibility for Greece to return to social cohesion with security and growth and also with a sustainable debt level. This will not only give security to Greece, but Europe as well.\u201d So nothing to confirm, or deny, yesterday\u2019s Bloomberg report that Germany could accept a staggered deal, in which Greece receives funds in return for a single big reform. While the talks took place, rumours swirled that Greece was proposing a nine-month bailout extension, and that it might accept its creditors demand for a 1% budget surplus this year. There was little clarity, though, on what economic measures it might take in return.... We\u2019ll be tracking all the events through the day....",

      "bodyText": "Have a break, and think about the following question. Which confectionery bar consists of four long wafer fingers covered in chocolate, which snap apart when pressed together? The answer, potentially, is any number of generic chocolate bars made by any manufacturer who wishes to do so. That prospect, at least, came a little closer on Thursday, after the advocate general of the European court of justice said that an attempt by Nestl\u00e9, the manufacturer of Kit Kats, to trademark the bar\u2019s distinctive four-fingered shape did not comply with EU law. Though the decision is not yet binding, the advocate general\u2019s opinion is almost always followed by the EU court \u2013 a ruling which could potentially open the way for a range of copycat Kit Kats in British sweetshops and supermarket aisles. The senior lawyer\u2019s opinion is merely the latest skirmish in a long-running battle between Nestl\u00e9, the biggest food company in the world, and Cadbury, now owned by the US group Mondel\u0113z, over trademarking their products in the UK \u2013 itself part of a much wider battle by manufacturers to protect their products in the multibillion-pound confectionery industry. Nestl\u00e9 first attempted to protect the Kit Kat four-finger design in 2010, arguing that in the 80 years since the chocolate bar was introduced by Rowntree in 1935, its shape and \u201csnap\u201d function had become distinctively associated with Kit Kats. Shown a picture of the bar without its wrapper or any branding, the company argued in court, 90% of people identified it as the snack that for decades has been advertised in the UK with the slogan \u201cHave a break, have a Kit Kat\u201d. But after Cadbury attempted to block the move, the high court rejected the Swiss giant\u2019s bid in 2013, forcing it to appeal, finally, to Europe. The current dispute follows an earlier and even longer-running court battle between the two confectionery giants, after Cadbury attempted in 2004 to trademark the particular shade of purple it used for its Dairy Milk bars. Arguing that it had been associated with the colour purple since Milk Tray was introduced in 1915, Cadbury registered the shade Pantone 2685C in 2004, a move that was initially successful despite Nestl\u00e9\u2019s objections. The decision was upheld by successive authorities before Nestl\u00e9 eventually had it overturned in the court of appeal in 2013. (Nestl\u00e9, as it happens, has also attempted to trademark a slightly different shade of purple which it uses for its Quality Street \u201cMy Purple Bar\u201d snack. Mondel\u0113z, meanwhile, has successfully registered the lilac shade it uses for its Milka products). In theory, the shapes of chocolate bars and other products should not be more difficult to trademark than their logos or names, says Sharon Daboul, a trademark attorney with EIP. Toblerone, she notes, has successfully trademarked its \u201czigzag prism\u201d shape. But in practice shapes are more difficult, \u201cbecause it\u2019s difficult for applicants to show that consumers look at the shape of the product alone as an indicator of trade origin.\u201d Consumers normally pay more attention to the label than the shape, she says, and \u201cwhere that is the case \u2013 ie the shape is not distinctive for the product \u2013 it\u2019s not capable of registration as a trademark. Many applications to register the shapes of washing tablets and bottles or containers have been refused on this basis.\u201d An attempt by Nestl\u00e9 to trademark the shape of the Polo mint \u2013 but without specifying its size or colour \u2013 was rejected by the court of appeal in 2004. (\u201cThis is an appeal with a hole in the middle,\u201d commented Lord Justice Mummery tartly.) Brands, Daboul says, are increasingly using non-traditional trademarks, such as shapes, colours and sounds, to identify their products, leading to an increased interest in legally protecting them. \u201cHaving a trademark registration gives the owner a monopoly right that could last forever if it is looked after, and that is why courts are careful to award these rights. If a manufacturer like Cadbury is able to bar other manufacturers from ever using the colour purple for chocolate, for instance \u2026 it presents them with a significant advantage.\u201d| Nestl\u00e9 may have deep pockets, but why go to so much trouble to trademark the Kit Kat shape, when its name and logo are already protected? \u201cI can only assume that there is a genuine concern that there would be imitators,\u201d says Vince Bamford of The Grocer. \u201cPeople have compared this to the Lego case [when the ECJ ruled in 2010 that the Danish toy manufacturer could not trademark the shape and dimensions of its bricks], and when you see what has happened to the toy market since Lego lost the protection of its bricks, there are now dozens of Lego imitators out there.\u201d Rather than a direct copycat challenge from Cadbury or another major confectionery manufacturer, he says, Nestl\u00e9 may be more conscious of the threat from discount supermarkets and others producing own-brand bars with uncanny similarities to its 80-year-old product. And while Kit Kat remains an enormously popular brand \u2013 it is the fifth most popular chocolate brand in the UK, with value sales totalling \u00a3180m a year in this country alone \u2013 2014 figures saw those sales down 8% year on year. \u201cArguably, this has at least given Kit Kat a bit of publicity, and that may be welcome,\u201d says Bamford. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 June 2015 to remove two incorrect references to copyright.",

Well, do ya, punk?\u201d The lines spoken by Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry sprang to mind when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that it had called its Greek negotiating team home from talks in Brussels. The IMF\u2019s message was short and brutal. There were still major differences between Greece and its creditors. There was no progress in narrowing those differences. The two sides were well away from an agreement. So much, then, for the talk earlier this week that a deal is close. Shares across Europe surged on hopes that a resolution to the crisis was at hand, but that optimism was punctured by the news from Washington. The IMF, clearly, has had enough. It was unimpressed by Greece\u2019s decision to bundle up all four of the debt repayments due this month and is frustrated by the unwillingness of Alexis Tsipras, the Greek prime minister, to cross its two \u201cred line\u201d issues \u2013 pensions and labour-market reform. This, then, is the IMF holding the gun to Alexis Tsipras\u2019s head. It feels like a pivotal moment, the point where the creditors are saying \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d and the Greeks have to decide whether the IMF really means it. Up until now, the view in Athens has been that the troika \u2013 made up of the IMF, the European Central Bank and the European commission \u2013 has been bluffing. The view has been that there is always room for a bit more haggling, always time to cut a better deal that would avoid the need to make the changes to pensions, VAT and collective bargaining being demanded in exchange for fresh financial assistance. Greece has reached this conclusion for a number of reasons. It thinks European politicians will be wary of anything that might push Greece out of the single currency, because that would be a setback to the idea that Europe only ever moved forward. It believes that Angela Merkel will be willing to compromise for fear that a Grexit would push Tsipras into the willing arms of Vladimir Putin. And it is convinced that the reforms being demanded by the troika are wrong-headed and will impose more pain on a population that has suffered enough. For their part, the creditors say Greece is not serious about reform, with the IMF noting that the Greek government is contributing 10% of GDP to pensions against an EU average of 2%. Put simply, they know Greece is running out of money and wants to stay in the euro. They are fed up with Tsipras acting like he is the one holding the .44 Magnum and they are threatening to pull the trigger. This movie climaxes next week.",

      "bodyText": "The International Monetary Fund dramatically pulled out of talks with debt-stricken Greece on Thursday after it accused Athens of failing to compromise over labour market and pension reforms. The Washington-based lender of last resort said its team of negotiators had quit talks in Brussels after reaching a stalemate and would be returning to Washington. The move left the Greek negotiating team with no option but to say it would also be leaving the talks and heading home to Athens. \u201cThe ball is very much in Greece\u2019s court,\u201d IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said. \u201cThere are major differences between us in most key areas. There has been no progress in narrowing these differences recently.\u201d The IMF\u2019s decision followed increasingly sharp criticism from EU officials frustrated at the Greek government\u2019s continued refusal to bow to creditors\u2019 demands. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, earlier attempted to pressure the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, to agree terms with its creditors, warning that the time for gambling was over. Tusk, a former prime minister of Poland, intervened in the negotiations over Greek debt repayments as Athens appeared steadfast in key areas of dispute. Tsipras was due on Friday to resume talks in Brussels with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, to resolve the ongoing dispute over Athens\u2019 implementation of wide-ranging reforms and steep spending cuts in return for further loans. Such a meeting is now in doubt. A spokesman for the Syriza-led government said its negotiating team is \u201cready\u201d to intensify efforts to wrap up a deal \u201ceven in the next 24 hours\u201d. He added: \u201cFor that reason it will continue to work on the remaining issues such as fiscal [gap] and debt sustainability.\u201d Greece has wrangled with creditors over the release of the remaining funds in its bailout. Without the \u20ac7.2bn available, Greece faces imminent bankruptcy, putting up capital controls and even exiting the euro. Tusk warned that unless an agreement is signed in the next few days there is a risk that the talks will collapse and Greece will default on its existing \u20ac320bn of loans. Speaking at the closing press conference for the EU-Latin America and Caribbean Summit, Tusk said that now is the time to decide. The Greek government has to be, I think, a little bit more realistic. It is very obvious that we need decisions, not negotiations.\u201d He added: \u201cThere is no more time for gambling. The day is coming, I\u2019m afraid, that someone says that the game is over.\u201d But the IMF\u2019s intervention effectively ended the technical talks over how to reform Greek labour markets and its state pension system, which are at the heart of the dispute. The IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, will attend a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Luxembourg on 18 June, Rice said. He said the IMF\u2019s door would always remain open if Greece wanted to table meaningful adjustments to its current position. \u201cAs our managing director has said many times, the IMF never leaves the table,\u201d he said. The head of Germany\u2019s central bank, Jens Weidmann, warned that the risk of insolvency was increasing by the day. \u201cThe contagion effects of such a scenario are certainly better contained than they were in the past, though they should not be underestimated,\u201d he said in a speech in London. \u201cBut the main losers in that scenario would be Greece and the Greek people.\u201d Until this week Greece had insisted it could not accept further austerity measures being imposed by Brussels as the price for more loans. But in recent days Greek negotiators have offered some concessions after settling on a limited number of \u201cred lines\u201d \u2013 EU/IMF proposals for tough labour market reforms, cuts in state pensions costs and a 1% budget surplus. On Thursday, the Greek national economy minister, Giorgos Stathakis, revealed that any new deal would include higher taxes Speaking to state-run TV\u2019s newly relaunched channel, ERT, Stathakis said the government would give the green light to privatisations and emergency levies on middle-income salaries. Publicly owned assets put up for sale would range from the port of Piraeus to the railway network, TrainOSE and regional airports nationwide, he said. Analysts said the measures would mean Tsipras rolling back on a raft of pre-election pledges, leaving the leader to count on his unrivalled popularity ratings and the widespread support for his Syriza party to carry him through. The eurozone\u2019s finance ministers, known as the eurogroup, convene in Luxembourg in a week, a meeting which Tusk says \u201cshould be decisive\u201d. Juncker told Tsipras recently that it was time to push through the gears. \u201cYou have to get the cow off the ice, where it keeps on slipping. We are trying to push it off again now,\u201d he said ahead of a meeting with Tsipras.",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne is facing questions about his claim that the taxpayer would make a \u00a314bn profit from its bailout of the banking system seven years ago. Andrew Tyrie, the incoming chairman of the Treasury select committee, said on Thursday the figure required a \u201cgreat deal of qualification\u201d. The chancellor told senior bankers at the Mansion House on Wednesday that bankers at Rothschild had calculated the profit figure as part of his announcement that he was ready to sell off the taxpayer\u2019s stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, even though the shares are trading at a \u00a313bn loss. Rothschild included fees paid by the bank to the Treasury as well as proceeds from the bailout of Lloyds Banking Group, Northern Rock and the mortgage book of Bradford &amp; Bingley to produce the \u00a314bn profit. But Tyrie said: \u201cThe Rothschild review puts the net gain to the taxpayer from the bank bailouts at \u00a314bn. This would benefit from a great deal of qualification. It excludes the cost of funding the bailouts. The Office for Budget Responsibility put this at \u00a317bn. And it treats fees paid in exchange for a service as if they were income, or recoveries.\u201d Shares in the 79% taxpayer-owned bank rose 2% on Thursday as investors had their first chance to react to the Mansion House announcement. The average price at which the taxpayer bought its stake in the bank was 502p, and after Thursday\u2019s rise the shares remained well below this level at 362p. Osborne was also facing questions from unions, Labour and analysts about the timing of the selloff after the shares rose. Rob MacGregor, Unite\u2019s national officer for finance, said: \u201cLike Royal Mail and British Gas before it, the Tories are ripping off the public by selling our stake in RBS at a knock-down rate to city investors.\u201d The shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, said: \u201cTaxpayers who bailed out RBS during the global financial crisis want their money back and will rightly be suspicious of any rush to sell.\u201d Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said: \u201cWe think that the timing of last night\u2019s announcement was arguably somewhat premature, dictated more by politics rather than, necessarily, an exercise in optimising market timing.\u201d However, Gordon said the shares could be supported in the coming 12 months as RBS generates capital and begins to return to profit after seven years of losses. Osborne hopes the proposed selldown of the government stake would make the shares more attractive to City investors, who may have been deterred by fears of political meddling. He also tried to counter concern that any selloff could not take place before the bank settled a mutibillion-pound lawsuit in the US over the way bonds were sold before the crisis. The analysis by Rothschild concludes that this penalty \u2013 possibly as much as \u00a32bn \u2013 is already reflected in the share price. The chancellor had faced calls from bankers to review taxation of the sector before his speech. He did not launch such a review but said: \u201cI want Britain to be the best place for European and global bank HQs.\u201d His comments came as HSBC reviews whether to remain headquartered in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Standard Chartered has promised its new boss Bill Winters up to \u00a36.5m in shares to cover any losses he may incur in quitting the hedge fund he was previously running. The exact size of the share awards for Winters, who became chief executive of the bank on Wednesday, will be determined once he has extricated himself from the Renshaw Bay hedge fund which he founded. The next opportunity to issue him shares in Standard Chartered is later this month, although it is unclear whether any losses from leaving the hedge fund \u2013 if any \u2013 will be determined by then. If he incurs losses, the shares would then be handed to him in three equal instalments over three years, starting in 2016. There are no performance conditions - he only has to remain in the employment of the bank. A former investment banker, Winters has been hired to improve the performance of the bank which has had a difficult two years. His predecessor Peter Sands, who had been one of the few bank bosses to remain in their jobs and was once tipped as a potential governor of the Bank of England, had been forced into issuing a series of profits warnings. The details of the potential share award are contained in Winter\u2019s contract. It shows he is on a salary of \u00a31.15m, and receiving benefits of \u00a335,000 together with an annual \u00a31.15m allowance of shares under a scheme designed to get around the EU\u2019s cap on bankers\u2019 bonuses. He is also entitled to participate in a long-term incentive plan, receiving share awards worth double his salary each year. They will pay out in future years. In addition, around \u00a3460,000 a year will be paid into a pension. Under the terms of the contact, which Winters signed on 5 March this year, he is required to hold 250,000 shares in the bank. The City welcomed the the respected American banker\u2019s appointment, with shares rising on his first day after he wrote to staff spelling out the importance of the bank\u2019s financial strength. Rumours have circulated for months that the bank will seek to raise funds from shareholders. The shares fell back on Thursday. When Winters\u2019 appointment was announced in February, it was part of a wider boardroom shakeout. Sands\u2019 departure was not the only exit announced. The bank also said chairman Sir John Peace and four other directors would depart. Peace is to stand down next year. Another company he chairs, the high fashion retailer Burberry, has been embroiled in a pay controversy. Burberry\u2019s remuneration report was rejected by shareholders last year while earlier this week it disclosed that its chief executive, Christopher Bailey, could receive shares worth up to \u00a350m in coming years through bonuses. Winters left JP Morgan following a row in 2009 and joined the commission set up in 2010 by the UK coalition to look at whether banks should be broken up. Chaired by Sir John Vickers, the commission recommended a ringfence to be erected between banks\u2019 high street operations and their riskier investment arms. He also established Renshaw Bay. His contract from Standard Chartered stipulates that he can remain a non-executive director of companies related to Renshaw Bay for 12 months. He can also retain his boardoom role at pharmaceutical company Novartis, which his contract describes as his main non-executive directorship. His seats on the boards of charities Colgate University, The Young Vic and the Print Room remain unaffected.",

      "bodyText": "The financial cost of Britain\u2019s ageing population will require a fresh \u00a320bn wave of spending cuts or tax increases from 2020 to bring the national debt back to pre-recession levels in 50 years time, the government\u2019s public finances watchdog has said. Long-term projections by the Office for Budget Responsibility show that the second round of austerity due to be detailed by George Osborne in next month\u2019s budget will not be sufficient to reduce debt to 40% of national income \u2013 its level before the economy entered its deepest postwar slump. The OBR said that by 2065, 26% of the population of England and Wales would be more than 65 years old, up from 18% today, increasing the cost of pensions, health and social care. \u201cOur central projections show that population ageing will put upward pressure on public spending\u201d, the OBR said in its annual fiscal sustainability report. It added that spending would rise as a share of national income while tax receipts would remain flat. As a result, the government\u2019s primary balance \u2013 the gap between its revenues and its spending excluding debt interest payments \u2013 would move from a surplus of 2.1% of GDP in 2019-20 to a rough balance by the mid-2030s and then to a deficit of 1.9% of GDP by 2064-65. The OBR said that if left unaddressed, ageing would put increasing pressure on the public finances. The national debt would come down from its current 80% of GDP to 54% by the early 2030s and then start rising again, reaching 87% of GDP in 50 years time. \u201cBeyond this point, debt would remain on a rising path,\u201d the OBR said. \u201cA once-and-for-all policy tightening of 1.1% of GDP in 2020-21 [\u00a320bn in today\u2019s terms] would see the debt ratio reach 40% of GDP in 2064-5.\u201d The OBR added that even a further \u00a320bn of belt-tightening would not be enough to prevent debt rising beyond 2064-5. For this, there would need to be spending cuts or tax increases worth 1.9% of GDP - around \u00a335bn in today\u2019s terms. The chancellor will use the OBR\u2019s report to support his case for making it unlawful for any government to run a budget deficit apart from in abnormal circumstances, since the national debt would eventually be eradicated if revenues permanently exceeded spending. The Treasury said: \u201cOur deficit is less than half what it was, but [today\u2019s] report from the OBR clearly shows the hard work that needs to be done to fix the public finances and deliver economic security and prosperity for working people. We have learned there is no shortcut to dealing with our deficit, which is why we need to roll up our sleeves and continue working through the plan to return the public finances to surplus.\u201d Robert Chote, the OBR\u2019s director, said it was up to Osborne to specify what constituted normal times. \u201cIt is not for us to decide under what circumstances it would be right to run a budget deficit,\u201d he said. The OBR provides half-yearly economic and financial forecasts for the Treasury, and Chote said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to have discussions with the Treasury twice a year about what \u2018normal\u2019 means.\u201d",

Sven Reinke, senior analyst and vice president at Moody\u2019s, said: \u201cAlthough the discounters\u2019 sales densities have caught up with the big four retailers, Aldi and Lidl could continue to gain around 1% market share every year supported by their store expansion plans at a time where the big four selectively close unprofitable stores in order to save costs.\u201d However, Moody\u2019s believes the UK\u2019s economic recovery, rising wages, improving consumer confidence and strategies adopted by the big grocers could lead to better margins from the 2016-17 financial year onwards. There remained a risk of an escalating price war if the big four struggle to adapt to lower market shares, Moody\u2019s said, but it played down the prospect. It said Asda aside, none of the other three players were able to engage in many more rounds of price cuts as they had limited financial capacity to absorb further margin declines. However, takeovers among the big four were also unlikely because of competition concerns. Moody\u2019s said the big four needed to figure out how to make large stores more profitable, and begin to generate sustainable returns from their online businesses.",

Revealed via Wikileaks, the annexe on \u201ctransparency and procedural fairness for pharmaceutical products and medical devices\u201d uncovered the draft agreements regarding medicines between the 12 TPPA member countries. The leak comes as US Republican leaders announced a vote on Friday that may provide Barack Obama a fast-track authority to complete the agreement with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The countries represent 40% of the world\u2019s economy. The leaked text, dated December 2014, laid out the draft rules for member countries regarding medicines under national health care programs, in Australia\u2019s case, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The TPP has yet to be signed off. The Abbott government has argued the trade deal will provide access for Australian products to other markets. But it requires Australia to trade off regulations that stop access by other countries and particularly multinational companies to the Australian market. Critics have suggested the deal, which is likely to include Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clauses, will allow big corporations to sue Australian governments. Philip Morris International is currently challenging the former Labor government\u2019s tobacco plain packaging laws under a Hong Kong trade treaty ISDS.

A cross-party parliamentary working group has formed, including Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, Labor MP Melissa Parke and independent senator Nick Xenophon. Whish-Wilson, who has not seen the draft as he refused to agree to the terms of the agreement, said the latest leak suggested the Australian PBS could be undermined. \u201cThese negotiations are happening behind closed doors, without the scrutiny of the parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the very least, the Australian people deserve to be reassured that the government won\u2019t allow any deal which drives up the public health costs for Australian taxpayers such as further subsidising important new medicines including biologics.\u201d During the most recent senate estimates in the past fortnight, Whish-Wilson questioned officials from the department of foreign affairs and trade about the strategic importance of the TPP to the United States.
