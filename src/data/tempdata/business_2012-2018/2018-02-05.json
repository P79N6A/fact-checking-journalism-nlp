      "bodyText": "US stocks took a further steep plunge on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1,175 points, the largest one-day points fall on record and erasing all the gains made so far this year. The drop came after another bad day on global markets as investors reacted to global equity losses overnight and concern that central banks will increase interest rates in response to inflationary pressures from surging global economies. The Dow dropped 1,600 points in one instance before bouncing back. The index is now off more than 1,800 points over two days of trading. Global stock markets have shown little volatility over the last few years amid a period of unprecedented low interest rates that followed in the wake of the great recession. But on the day that new Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, took office, replacing Janet Yellen, that quiet period seemed to be over. \u201cThis was volatility unleashed,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at at Cresset Wealth. \u201cIt\u2019s partially fear of interest rates, partially this new Fed chairman Jerome Powell, partially the market is overvalued relative to fundamentals.\u201d While market fear may not be based in any change in economic fundamentals, in its last meeting under chair Yellen, the Federal Reserve indicated it expects inflation pressures to increase through the year. According to projections released in December, officials expect three rate hikes in 2018 \u2013 so long as market conditions remain broadly as they are \u2013 but some economists believe the central bank could add another increase at its final meeting of the year. If the market falls continue they could prove problematic for Donald Trump who has consistently touted record high stock markets as proof that his presidency is boosting the economy. US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February. However, the White House, responding to the market drop insisted on Monday night that long-term economic fundamentals \u201cremain exceptionally strong\u201d. The plunge, initially triggered by fears that strong US employment numbers would lead to wage demands and rising inflation, represents the first two-day drop of 1,000 points or greater for the Dow since August 2015. The sell-off was reflected on other US indexes, with the S&amp;P 500 also recording its steepest drop since 2015 and erasing its gains for the year. The sell-off represents a stark turnaround in market sentiments, said Ablin. \u201cIn the middle of last month, optimism, bullishness and complacency was at an all-time high. It\u2019s certainly fearful now,\u201d said Ablin. In London, shares in Britain\u2019s top 100 publicly listed companies on Monday suffered their worst single-day slump since Theresa May called the snap election last April. The index of Britain\u2019s top 100 companies stretched its longest losing streak since last November into a fifth day, following a 1.3% fall. The FTSE 100 index tumbled to 7,345, having peaked at almost 7,800 last month. Hussein Sayed, the chief market strategist at currency dealer FXTM, said investors were nervous about the prospect of higher interest rates. \u201cThe era of cheap money is ending, and for markets who got addicted to it, it\u2019s undoubtedly bad news,\u201d he said. The Fed is expected to react to survey data published last week showing that average US wage growth hit 2.9% in January and could go above 3% in the next few months. Wage increases are one of the main components pushing up prices in US shops. Stock markets remain high globally and the economies of most of the world\u2019s biggest countries are robust. But fears about the pace of rate increases and the size of the US\u2019s ballooning deficit have worried some investors. Last week, a member of the Fed\u2019s main interest-rate setting committee, Robert Kaplan, suggested that rates could increase by more than 0.75 percentage points this year if the economy maintains its fast rate of growth and wages continue to rise strongly. He said: \u201cYou will see some inflation pressure this year. I believe that the Fed should be removing accommodation gradually but deliberately.\u201d Mark Haefele, the global chief investment officer of wealth management at UBS, said the bond market, which trades in government and corporate debt, remained steady despite recent declines in values that increased the likelihood of defaults. He said stock market investors should sit tight while bond yields, which measure the risk attached to each bond, remained modest. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that now is a time to reduce exposure to stocks.\u201d Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said: \u201cMarkets have been addicted to low interest rates and global central banks pumping money into the financial system. As economies around the world are improving, this means higher interest rates and less stimulus from central banks. That\u2019s why investors are throwing a hissy-fit. Not because anything is wrong.\u201d Far eastern markets fell overnight by the most in over a year, with the Nikkei among the worst affected following a 2.5% drop to 22,682. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil slid to $67.30 from above $70 in the middle of last month. The FTSE\u2019s fall was limited by worse than expected economic data that sent the pound down to $1.40 from $1.42 overnight. Car registrations in the UK slumped by 6% in January and the Markit/CIPS survey of the services sector recorded its worst level of growth for 16 months. Many of the UK\u2019s biggest businesses earn the majority of their income in dollars and any increase in the dollar\u2019s value versus the pound increases their profits. Last month, Trump boasted that the stock market was a measure of his successful first year in office. When the market reached 25,075 on 5 January, an increase of more than 1,000 points in little over a month, He said: \u201cRecord fastest 1000 point move in history. This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. Six trillion dollars in value created!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Labor party has deftly put pressure on the government at the start of this political year by offering to limit private health insurance premium increases to 2%. It\u2019s a pitch that will appeal to many given wide dissatisfaction with private health insurance. But as expected, it has also brought about complaints from the CEOs of this very protected industry that fly in the face of evidence. Among the more humorous statements made after Bill Shorten\u2019s announcement of the premium limit was from the chief executive of health fund nib, Mark Fitzgibbon, who suggested it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that \u201ca future government would seek to set prices in any highly competitive market.\u201d He said that it \u201cmay be politically popular but it\u2019s an affront to how the free market operates. What next? Food, clothing, car insurance, school fees and petrol?\u201d In reality, what is absurd is not the ALP\u2019s policy but the suggestion the private health insurance industry is an example of a free market. Far from being free, the industry is absolutely dependent upon governments doing all they can to encourage people to join it and penalise those who don\u2019t. Since the first step into universal healthcare with Medibank in 1975, the percentage of the population in private health insurance has steadily fallen. When the Hawke government introduced Medicare in 1984, 54% of the population held private health insurance; by 1997 it was down to 33%. Then the Howard government came to the rescue. It introduced the Medicare levy surcharge for everyone earning over $100,000, and in 1999 the 30% private health insurance rebate. And then came the doozy \u2013 in 1999 the Howard government came up with a plan to blackmail people into joining private health insurance. The introduction of \u201cLife Time Health Cover\u201d in July 2000, which penalised people 2% of the premium for every year over 30 they weren\u2019t in private health, saw the percentage of those in the private health system rise to 46% \u2013 around where it has remained ever since. The big reason for the jump was people in their 30s \u2013 people who had previously shown limited desire to be in private health \u2013 realised they needed to join, or face much higher premiums when they joined in their 50s and 60s when they might actually use it: Take away that government-mandated penalty, and people would leave private health in their droves. The free market at play without that government blackmail would likely see many of the 60% of those with health insurance who say it does not deliver value for money leave the system. And you can understand why nearly two-thirds of private health insurance holders think that, given with the latest increase in premiums of 3.95%, the cost of health coverage has far outstripped both overall inflation and wages growth: And yet the industry remains extremely profitable for the 13 of the 37 private health insurance companies that are for-profit. As the AMA told a Senate committee on the value and affordability of private health insurance and out-of-pocket medical costs last year, \u201cthe shift to a full-profit industry has created the need to ensure that there are sufficient profits to allow a return to shareholders. This is driving much of the growth in increased premiums.\u201d When announcing the policy, Shorten noted that in the last financial year Australians paid $4bn more in private health insurance premiums than they got back in benefits, and the industry made pre-tax profits of $1.8bn. But it is not just the cost of the premiums \u2013 it is what you get for your money that is a concern. Increasingly policies contain exclusions \u2013 exclusions which add to the complexity of the system and leave people unaware of what they are precisely covered for: Similarly there has been a large increase in the number of policies that contain excess or co-payments \u2013 a trend that began with the introduction of lifetime health cover as people sought to take out the cheapest policy they could find to avoid the over-30 penalty: But where once it was a small number, now, over 80% of policies have excesses and co-payments. Private health insurance is no longer what it used to be. Little wonder people are dissatisfied \u2013 government policy in effect forced them to join, and yet they get a policy that offers less than in the past and the cost of which increases well above income growth year on year. Not surprisingly, people the their 20s have stopped taking out private health insurance: But this is a worry for private health insurance companies, because they need those healthy young people paying for the insurance and not using it \u2013 unlike the elderly who do. And this is the problem with all private health, and why a public health system that uses taxation is a much better way of operating. We have a system that attempts to force young people to take out a private insurance policy they don\u2019t want or particularly need in order to fund the use of it by older people. As the Centre for Policy Development research fellow Ian McAuley told Melissa Davey last year, it is essentially \u201ctransferring funds from the young to the old\u201d. We have a public and private health mix in Australia, but consistently over the past 40 years people have revealed through their spending choices they prefer the public system. And yet rather than pick the winner, governments of both persuasion have attempted to prop up the private sector. And as ever the private system has taken advantage \u2013 offering less coverage while complaining about needing ever more government assistance. If limiting the amount they are propped up each year to 2% is an affront to the free market, let the private health sector make their case without all the other legislated measures and see how people would vote with their wallets \u2013 history tells us what will happen.

It overbid and it is now paying the price,\u201d says the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, announcing that the East Coast mainline could once again be taken into public hands. Grayling\u2019s first two statements are correct. Stagecoach plainly took leave of its senses in agreeing to pay \u00a33.3bn to run the London-to-Edinburgh line for eight years. The company couldn\u2019t even keep the financial wheels turning for three years and has now breached a financial covenant. But does a \u00a3200m forfeit really count as paying the price? Given the size of the contract and the promises to make payments to the Treasury, the sum looks modest. The company has got off lightly. The worse part, though, is that Stagecoach gets to bid for more franchises in future, which surely makes little sense if the company\u2019s forecasting has been shown to be hopeless. At the very least, Grayling should have ruled Stagecoach offside for the mysterious \u201cpublic-private partnership\u201d he plans to introduce on the East Coast from 2020. Grayling should also be less wedded to his 2020 model. If an in-house departmental crew gets the East Coast gig for three years and does a decent job for customers and the Treasury, what\u2019s the problem with having a longer-lasting wholly public arrangement? Keep an open mind and be pragmatic. Markets can go down as well as up According to the bulls, the current \u201ccorrection\u201d in share prices, if that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing, is nothing to worry about. The previous state of bliss \u2013 a two-year period when share prices marched higher with minimal volatility \u2013 couldn\u2019t last for ever. Normal service will be resumed, runs the argument, as soon as investors stop worrying about rises in US interest rates that, on any historical perspective, will probably be quite modest. Such comforting thoughts are plainly not ridiculous. The sell-off in stock markets started last Friday with US figures that showed wages rising at 2.9%. It normally takes something more substantial to trigger a major turning point for markets. Yet this \u201cjust a blip\u201d theory feels too complacent. The hard fact is that share prices, in almost every sector of the market, are expensive on most traditional yardsticks of value. It also true that, on average, companies (especially in the US) are more financially leveraged than they have been in the past. That cocktail is dangerous if the cost of borrowing is rising. It may not lead to bad side-effects this time, but conditions are ripe for a proper and nasty fall. A DIY takeover The prize for worst retail acquisition in the UK in recent years goes to the Australian group Wesfarmers, which somehow convinced itself that paying \u00a3340m to own Homebase was a good idea. Two years later, it knows better. It is writing off \u00a3454m on the deal, a lot more than it paid in the first place, plus another \u00a3130m to cover stock write-downs, store closures and tax assets. To complete the misery, first-half trading losses at the UK business now known as Bunnings will be \u00a397m. Rewind the clock and Wesfarmers\u2019 bullishness is laughable. The opportunity to enter the \u201cattractive\u201d UK market had been \u201ccomprehensively researched and carefully considered\u201d. Whatever they were studying, the Bunnings brigade seem to have missed the fact the British DIY customer is a creature of seasonal habits, and that some of those habits differ from Australian tastes. Wesfarmers\u2019 new managing director, Rob Scott, volunteered a very long list of categories where Bunnings UK had the wrong products over the winter: kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, tiling, plumbing, wallpaper, storage, cleaning, heating and lighting. Maybe the hammers were splendid. A full review will follow, and the result will be unveiled in June. By that time, one assumes, Wesfarmers will have realised that the market for DIY sheds is horrible. Even Kingfisher is making heavy work of overhauling B&amp;Q, and Amazon\u2019s tentacles extend everywhere these days. Getting out of the UK is not the preferred option, said Scott, which means it\u2019s a possibility. It\u2019s not only UK retailers, it seems, that soon regret hubristic foreign adventures.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Pensions advisers repeatedly warned that Carillion was prioritising shareholder dividends over the funding of its pension scheme years before the government contractor\u2019s collapse, according to documents released by the work and pensions committee. The committee, whose members will question former Carillion directors at a hearing on Tuesday, released new evidence hours after the number of confirmed job losses at Carillion hit 829, with uncertainty persisting over a further 17,500. The MPs published documents that they said indicated \u201clong-term indifference\u201d by former directors towards the company\u2019s pension obligations, leading to \u201cchronic underfunding\u201d of a scheme relied on by 27,000 members. The reports, written by a company advising Carillion\u2019s pension trustees, contain multiple warnings that its plan to plug its deficit stretched over too many years and that the firm diverted money to dividends and debt interest rather than into its retirement schemes. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the work and pensions select committee, said: \u201cClear warning signs were evident several years ago in the assessments of the company\u2019s commitment to its pension schemes. Yet as late as 2015, [former finance director] Richard Adam, one of the directors appearing before us tomorrow, gave a farcically optimistic report to the pension trustees.\u201d The committee published a series of documents written by Gazelle Pension Advisory Services, which was advising trustees of a Carillion pension scheme estimated to have a \u00a3990m deficit. A report produced by Gazelle for the trustees in 2012 warns that \u201chistorically, Carillion has subordinated the pension schemes to other demands on cashflow, in particular repaying acquisition debt, a progressive dividend policy and equity payments into PPP [public-private partnership] projects\u201d. The following year, Gazelle flagged up a \u201crelative disparity\u201d between the assessment of the company\u2019s health it was giving to City shareholders and what it was telling pensioners. It said this meant that an increase in pension payments was spread over too many years, leaving retirees bearing \u201ca disproportionate share of risk in the business\u201d. In an April 2016 report for the trustees of one of Carillion\u2019s 13 pension schemes, Gazelle highlighted that City speculators were betting that the company was in trouble by short-selling their shares. A final report in May 2017 warned that Carillion\u2019s debts had reached a level that meant it could not \u201ccounter material financial shocks or disappointments\u201d and pointed out that its pension deficit was now equivalent to the company\u2019s entire stock market value. Gazelle advised that only if Carillion \u201ccuts the dividends or produces an alternative plan to reduce debt will the [pension] sponsor constraints be eased\u201d. Former Carillion directors are expected to face lengthy questioning at evidence sessions on Tuesday, at the beginning of a joint inquiry by the work and pensions select committee and the business, energy and industrial strategy committee, chaired by Labour\u2019s Rachel Reeves.",

Pick your own offers gave shoppers 20% off on 10 chosen products from a range of hundreds, which could be anything from expensive buys such as smoked salmon to frequently bought items such as loo roll. It was available to millions of holders of the myWaitrose card. Launched by the grocer as an eye-catching salvo in the UK supermarket price war in June 2015, pick your own offers was described by the then managing director, Mark Price, as \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d but potentially very expensive. It was estimated that the price cuts could cost up to \u00a3260m a year or more, with Waitrose splitting that cost with suppliers it signed up. Members of HotUKDeals, the UK\u2019s biggest deal-sharing community, spotted that the scheme was due to close on 28 February. According to a staff briefing document, the reason given was that customers had told Waitrose they found the \u201cprocess for choosing and remembering their picks quite confusing\u201d. Waitrose will instead be \u201cinvesting more in tailored vouchers and personalised offers sent through the post or at the checkout\u201d, the document says. These will be similar to those offered by other retailers including John Lewis through its myJohn Lewis card, and Marks &amp; Spencer via its Sparks scheme.

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 has posted its worst one-day performance since last April, as the London index picked up from a Wall Street sell-off at the end of last week. Indices also fell in Europe and Asia. Here we look at some of the issues raised by the sell-off. Why are stock markets falling? For several weeks, economists and analysts have warned that inflation levels in major economies could increase this year beyond the 2% to 3% that central banks believe is good for developed countries. Official US figures turned those concerns into a sell-off last Friday, after they showed average wage rises in the US had reached 2.9%. The data increased fears that shop prices would soon rise further, increasing the pressure for high interest rates to calm the economy down. Investors then bolted at the prospect of an era of cheap money \u2013 which encourages consumers and companies to spend \u2013 coming to an end. Over the past month, several members of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, have argued that three 0.25% interest rate rises scheduled for this year could become four or five. Is there worse to come? There is every prospect that the US economic data will continue to strengthen, increasing the potential for higher interest rates. President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform bill, which gained approval in Congress before Christmas, will inject more than $1tn (\u00a3710bn) into the US economy, much of it in the form of corporation tax cuts. Many firms have pledged to give a slice of the cash to their workers. Decades of flat wages should mean that increases expected in 2018 and possibly 2019 are too small to trigger a reaction from the central bank, but investors are betting rates will rise. As a consequence, stock market jitters could continue. Is it a threat to the global economy? Many developing world economies have borrowed heavily in dollars and will be stung by the higher cost of servicing their debts. On the other hand, a booming US economy will suck in imports from those nations, boosting the incomes of the developing world. However, the eurozone looks unlikely to increase interest rates until its recovery is more firmly anchored. That means the euro will continue to rise in value against the dollar, making it harder for European countries to export to the US. What does it mean for the UK economy? A falling stock market should not affect the economy immediately. Its main effect should be to limit the availability of shareholder funds for investment, affecting the long-term health of the economy. But there is a strong feedback loop from falling wealth, such as share portfolios, into lower consumer spending. Shoppers measure their financial well-being in terms of their asset-based wealth as much as their income. As a result, a big fall in share prices could damage the economy.",

But there is a strong feedback loop from falling wealth, such as share portfolios, into lower consumer spending. Shoppers measure their financial well-being in terms of their asset-based wealth as much as their income. As a result, a big fall in share prices could damage the economy. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

As vitally important as the case for a universal basic income is, as Larry Elliott observes (Robots will take our jobs. We\u2019d better plan now, before it\u2019s too late, 1 February), a debate that focuses solely on the concept of paid work will only take us so far, and fails to acknowledge the millions of disabled people, as well as millions of carers, who go unpaid for the work they do every day. When it comes to the end of work as we know it, ableism is surely at the core of this flawed perspective. Disabled people have been redefining the idea of what it means to work, to create, to find purpose and to contribute to society since the dawn of time, the majority of which goes unpaid. While the economics of this debate are the driving force of the argument, surely it\u2019s time to recognise and learn from the radical ways in which disabled people are working, in an economic structure that systematically excludes and discriminates against them.

      "bodyText": "Investors in the mining giant Rio Tinto are being recruited to demand the company quit the Minerals Council of Australia. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) has urged shareholders to co-file a resolution at Rio Tinto\u2019s annual general meetings in Australia and the UK in the autumn. The centre successfully filed a similar motion at BHP\u2019s AGMs last year, leading the company to review its membership of trade associations. In that review, published in December, BHP warned the MCA it would quit the body if it did not change its lobbying practices in relation to coal. BHP and Rio Tinto are the MCA\u2019s two biggest members. BHP provides the MCA with 17% of its income from membership fees and it is believed Rio Tinto contributes a similar amount. Emerging from a meeting with Rio Tinto executives on Monday, the chief executive of ACCR, Brynn O\u2019Brien, said she had told them the group was preparing its shareholder motion. She said the group needed to find 100 shareholders by the end of the month to move a resolution. She said it would be very similar to the one filed at BHP\u2019s AGMs, which received support from more than 9% of shareholders. That resolution said the Minerals Council had \u201cdiminished the federal government\u2019s ability to resolve a national policy issue of material relevance to our company and the stability of its operations\u201d. \u201cThe MCA\u2019s activities undermine the possibility of achieving what our company has stated an \u2018effective policy framework\u2019 should include: a complementary set of measures including a price on carbon, support for low-emissions technologies, energy efficiency and measures to build resilience. \u201cOver time, these activities have the potential to undermine shareholder value, given our company\u2019s exposure to climate-related risk and energy instability.\u201d O\u2019Brien said Rio Tinto shareholders might be even more likely to support such a resolution, since the company is based in the UK, where more active shareholder engagement is common. \u201cThere\u2019s a greater familiarity of UK investors to the process of shareholder resolutions and more comfort with robust engagement in public with big companies,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. O\u2019Brien said discussions with Rio Tinto were continuing and no decision would be made on filing the resolution until the last minute. She declined to say what Rio could do to avoid the resolution but said simply committing to a review of trade association memberships \u2013 as BHP did \u2013 would not be enough. \u201cWe think the commitment to doing a review doesn\u2019t wholly manage the financial risks they face as a major energy user, or the social and reputational risks they face.\u201d",

It is the second wave of redundancies to be confirmed and takes the number of job losses to 829 from a 19,500-strong UK workforce. Small businesses have expressed concern that more could follow in Carillion\u2019s sprawling supply chain. The receiver, part of the Insolvency Service, has found new employers for 100 more staff who were working on private sector contracts, taking the number of jobs saved so far to 1,019. The latest update comes the day before seven former Carillion directors give evidence to a committee of MPs about how a company with billions of pounds worth of contracts announced a profit warning in July and was in liquidation by the end of the year. Witnesses include the former chief executive, Richard Howson, who stepped down after the July profit warning, and the ex-chairman, Phillip Green, an adviser to Theresa May on corporate responsibility. Weeks after the company\u2019s failure, 17,562 former Carillion staff are yet to learn of their future. Hundreds have been temporarily transferred to other employers to ensure they continue to be paid and to keep vital public services running. The receiver said the latest jobs to be saved were in the public sector, while those being made redundant are \u201cconnected with private and public contracts across different parts of the country, as well as back-office functions\u201d. \u201cWe appreciate this will be a difficult time for those who have lost their jobs,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cJobcentre Plus\u2019 rapid response service stands ready to support any of these employees by providing advice and information so people can move into a new job as quickly as possible. \u201cPeople who have been made redundant will also be entitled to make a claim for statutory redundancy payments. \u201cOur efforts are focused on the smooth transfer of Carillion\u2019s contracts to new providers and we will continue to keep Carillion\u2019s workforce updated as these arrangements are finalised.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Up to 40 Homebase and Bunnings DIY stores could be closed, putting hundreds of jobs at risk, after the group\u2019s Australian owner said it was reviewing the future of its UK business. The closures raised speculation that Wesfarmers, which bought Homebase for \u00a3340m two years ago, would be forced into exiting the UK after a botched takeover by its own admission. Rob Scott, Wesfarmers\u2019 managing director, said the 250-store UK business was expected to make an underlying loss of \u00a397m in the half year after a \u00a354m loss in the year to June 2017. The Australian group is taking a \u00a3584m writedown on the business, most of which relates to the value of the Homebase brand. Scott said its performance had been below expectations, which was \u201cobviously disappointing\u201d. He said the problems were \u201cthrough our own doing\u201d as the company had ditched popular ranges such as kitchens and bathrooms and ousted concessions such as Laura Ashley, Habitat and Argos without having alternatives in place. Scott said the \u201cpace and nature of change had not been well received by Homebase customers\u201d. Getting rid of the existing British management team also led to a loss of insight that had affected performance, he added. He said between 20 and 40 stores in the UK could close as the group tried to move out of Homebase outlets which did not justify the investment needed to turn them into Bunnings stores. The company, which has so far converted 19 Homebase outlets into Bunnings stores, said it would reveal further details of its review in June. Wesfarmers had intended to spend \u00a3500m on giving the Homebase chain a facelift, turning it into a British version of its successful Australian DIY chain Bunnings, which is famous for low prices and sausage sizzles. Michael Schneider, Bunnings group\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cIt is clear that a significant amount of change has been driven through Homebase since the acquisition, and the disruption caused by the rapid repositioning of the business has contributed to greater than expected losses across the Homebase network.\u201d The total writedown includes a \u00a340m charge against the cost of store closures and \u00a337m relating to \u201cexcess, unsuitable and display stock\u201d. \u201cIt appears that Wesfarmers\u2019 ill-considered policies have backed it into an untenable corner,\u201d said Thomas Brereton, a retail analyst at GlobalData. \u201cThese depressing figures show that Wesfarmers must consider all opportunities to lessen its exposure to the fraught UK market.\u201d Damian McGloughlin, a former B&amp;Q executive, is to become managing director of Bunnings\u2019 UK business, taking over from PJ Davis who is retiring after going on extended leave last month. News of Homebase\u2019s difficulties bolstered shares in rival Kingfisher, which owns B&amp;Q, sending them 1.5% higher.",

      "bodyText": "Charles Wilson, the chief executive of Booker, is to run Tesco\u2019s core UK and Ireland retail operations following Tesco\u2019s \u00a33.7bn takeover of the wholesaler next month. Wilson\u2019s appointment, on basic pay of \u00a3575,000, comes as Tesco warned that up to 250 head office jobs were likely to go as result of the merger. In a circular to shareholders, the supermarket said it intends to keep both Booker\u2019s head office in Wellingborough and its own in Welwyn Garden City but that \u201ccertain central functions\u201d would be merged, leading to job losses \u201cprimarily through natural attrition\u201d. The cuts come after Tesco last month said it was stripping out a layer of management in stores, putting up to 1,700 jobs at risk. The company has already cut thousands of jobs in recent years including up to 1,200 at head office last summer. The highly regarded Booker boss will replace Matt Davies, the chief executive of Tesco\u2019s UK and Irish business, who is leaving the group at the end of April if the deal goes ahead. Tesco shareholders are due to vote on the Booker acquisition at a meeting on 28 February and the deal is expected to complete on 5 March. In a letter to shareholders about the deal, Tesco said it now expects to make at least \u00a31.57bn in operating profit excluding one-off items for the year to 24 February. This is slightly ahead of City expectations of \u00a31.56bn, and above last year\u2019s \u00a31.28bn profit. The improved profit performance comes after Tesco posted underlying growth of 1.9% over the key Christmas weeks. Tesco said it would pay a final dividend of 2p a share for the year, following an interim dividend of 1p in October \u2013 the first such payment to shareholders since 2014-15. Wilson\u2019s new role heading Tesco\u2019s retail and wholesale businesses in the UK will allow him to develop new hybrid formats. Tesco will begin testing one new concept, Chef Central, in its Bar Hill store in Cambridge later this month. Booker will run the shop-in-shop which will sell catering-sized packs of goods such as oil and rice aimed at professional cooks. The Tesco group chief executive, Dave Lewis, said Wilson was \u201cideally suited\u201d to lead the UK and Ireland business in the next phase of Tesco\u2019s turnaround. \u201cHe brings substantial commercial and retail experience and has an exceptional track record of increasing performance and driving growth in customer-focused businesses,\u201d Lewis said. The Booker deal has been waved through by the competition watchdog, despite rival wholesalers warning it could drive them out of business. Some major Tesco shareholders \u2013 Schroders and Artisan Partners \u2013 have also voiced opposition to the acquisition, urging Lewis to focus on the supermarket group\u2019s turnaround instead.",

The latest health check of a sector that includes hotels, restaurants, transport and the City from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) found that a loss of clients and lingering Brexit uncertainty had led to a dip in activity. The monthly purchasing managers\u2019 index from IHS Markit/CIPS fell from 54.2 points in December to 53.0 in January, its weakest since September 2016 and only slightly above the 50.0 cut-off point between expansion and recession. Services account for almost four-fifths of the UK\u2019s gross domestic product, but similar surveys for manufacturing and construction released last week also showed signs of slower UK growth at a time when other major economies \u2013 the US, the eurozone and Japan \u2013 have been expanding strongly. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said the three PMI surveys were consistent with the economy growing at 0.3% in the first three months of 2018 \u2013 down from 0.5% in the final quarter of 2017. \u201cThe pace of UK economic growth slowed sharply at the start of the year as January saw a triple whammy of weaker PMI surveys,\u201d he said. \u201cService sector expansion slid to a 16-month low, reflecting a marked waning in growth of demand for business and consumer-facing services such as hotels and restaurants. Demand for transport and communication services was down for the second straight month.\u201d Despite weaker expansion than seen in 2017, the services PMI showed that companies continued to hire staff amid positive expectations about the outlook for their businesses. The survey also reported an easing of the inflationary pressures that emerged as a result of the fall in the pound after the EU referendum. City analysts said the slowdown in the PMIs in January had put paid to any possibility that the Bank of England might raise interest rates at the meeting of its monetary policy committee this week.",

Overall, the UK\u2019s new car market declined by 6.3% in January with 163,615 cars leaving showrooms. It follows a downward trend that started last April after years of record growth. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the decline in diesel sales was concerning, although dealers said the figures were \u201can expected correction\u201d. Sales of petrol cars rose by 8% as consumers switched away from diesel, sending market share down to 36% of new vehicles, as the extent of the air pollution crisis has become evident and government raised tax on vehicles not meeting the latest emissions standards. Electric and other alternative fuel vehicles continued to expand their sales rapidly, albeit from a small base, with just more than 9,000 sold in January. Sales of SUVs also rose by 6.6%. Business purchases of vehicles fell by almost 30%, possibly affected by tax changes in the budget. British factories are still largely invested in diesel technology that had been backed by government for greater fuel efficiency, before the extent of rigged emission tests and urban air pollution became clear. Last year, more than two in five of the cars leaving British production lines were diesels, as well as more than 1m engines, which the SMMT said directly supported about 3,350 jobs. The SMMT chief executive, Mike Hawes, said: \u201cGiven fleet renewal is the fastest way to improve air quality and reduce CO2, we need government policy to encourage take-up of the latest advanced low-emission diesels as, for many drivers, they remain the right choice economically and environmentally.\u201d The director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, Sue Robinson, said: \u201cThe sector performed exceptionally well in the first quarter of 2017, meaning the decline reflects an expected market correction. \u201cFranchised dealers continue to see a buoyant market on the used car side.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A courier for the parcel giant DPD who was fined for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes collapsed and died of the disease, it has emerged. Don Lane, 53, from Christchurch in Dorset, missed appointments with specialists because he felt under pressure to cover his round and faced DPD\u2019s \u00a3150 daily penalties if he did not find cover, his widow has told the Guardian. DPD delivers parcels for Marks &amp; Spencer, Amazon and John Lewis but only pays couriers per parcel delivered. It treats them as self-employed franchisees and they receive no sick or holiday pay. The company\u2019s system of charging drivers if they cannot cover their round has been described as appalling by the chairman of the House of Commons\u2019 work and pensions committee, Frank Field. Lane had collapsed twice, including once into a diabetic coma while at the wheel of his DPD van during deliveries, when the company fined him in July after he went to see a specialist about eye damage caused by diabetes. He collapsed again in September and finally in late December having worked through illness during the Christmas rush. He died at the Royal Bournemouth hospital on 4 January, leaving behind a widow, Ruth, and a 22-year-old son. He had worked for DPD for 19 years. Ruth Lane told the Guardian: \u201cThere was a constant threat of a fine. They had to deliver the parcels to tight slots and the pressure to get them done was huge. He was putting the company before his own health. He wasn\u2019t able to do his parcels first and make the hospital appointments, so he would cancel on the day. \u201cHe collapsed in January 2017 and they knew that because they collected his van. It was after that Don cancelled three appointments. DPD had a duty of care to make sure he got to those appointments, but they failed in it.\u201d She added that in March her husband had told her: \u201cI think I am going to die.\u201d Lane\u2019s death comes as concern mounts at the human cost of the gig economy, which accounts for 1.1 million people, many working as couriers and minicab drivers. It is likely to increase pressure on the government to make meaningful reforms to employment law in a delayed announcement on modern working practices expected this week. Trade unions last night said the government must crack down on bogus self-employment. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe insecure work free-for-all has to end \u2026 this will be a real test of Theresa May\u2019s government. Does she even have a domestic agenda any more?\u201d DPD, one of the most successful firms operating in the gig economy, made over \u00a3100m profit after tax in 2016. Both it and Hermes, another parcel company relying on self-employed couriers, are facing employment tribunal claims from people who believe they should be treated as employed. Field described Lane\u2019s death as \u201ca new low for the gig economy\u201d and called on Theresa May to urgently introduce new legislation to protect \u201cthis small army of workers at the bottom of the pile \u2026 who are being badly exploited\u201d. Lane disputed the \u00a3150 charge in July, insisting that he had told his bosses about the appointment months earlier. According to correspondence seen by the Guardian, he told his manager: \u201cI have cancelled so many appointments because I couldn\u2019t make the time to get there that the renal department have stopped treating me. I had to go.\u201d His DPD area manager replied: \u201cI fail to understand why a full day off was required and as such do not see that the breach [the \u00a3150 fine] should be rescinded.\u201d During the appointment, doctors found Lane\u2019s blood pressure and cholesterol were high, he had anaemia and rising levels of creatine in his kidneys, a warning sign of renal failure. In September 2017 he collapsed into another diabetic coma. In the days before he died, he was feeling sick and vomiting blood, Ruth said, adding that he told her: \u201cI really don\u2019t want to work, but I have to.\u201d. \u201cThey are like employees, not self-employed,\u201d she said. A colleague, who asked not to be named for fear that DPD would terminate his contract, said: \u201cDon was falling apart, but they wouldn\u2019t take it easy on him. They push drivers till they break. I definitely think they contributed to this. They knew Don was diabetic. They should have looked after him more.\u201d DPD said in a statement that it was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d that it had charged Lane, but cited \u201cconfusion\u201d at the time. \u201cDon attended his appointment, but it isn\u2019t clear why he was then charged, when the charge hadn\u2019t been been applied at any other time,\u201d it said. \u201cWe got it wrong on that occasion.\u201d Lane first collapsed on 27 December 2016 and Ruth texted his manager to say: \u201che knows he has to come into work tomorrow as he\u2019ll get charged\u201d. On that occasion, the manager responded that \u201che has no worries about being charged\u201d. \u201cIn relation to Don\u2019s poor health at the end of December 2016 and into January 2017, we refute the claim that he was under pressure and threatened with a \u00a3150 charge,\u201d DPD said. It said that it monitored Lane\u2019s health during 2017 but did not know that he had suffered another diabetic coma in September. It said he had a quiet rural route with a relatively small number of deliveries, which suited him \u201cas it was convenient for his hospital appointments\u201d. \u201cIn the runup to Christmas, it is normal in the industry for drivers to work additional days at the weekend and Don was working his normal route,\u201d DPD said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t made aware that Don was feeling sick and vomiting up some blood at this time. We were shocked and hugely saddened by Don\u2019s death and our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this difficult time.\u201d DPD said its drivers \u201cdo not have to provide the service personally, and drivers have the option of providing a substitute driver in the event of sickness. Don was aware of the need to provide a substitute.\u201d It said if a driver cannot find a substitute, it tries to reallocate the route among other drivers. DPD uses around 5,000 self-employed couriers. They are under pressure to deliver parcels to restricted time slots, must wear a uniform, hire a DPD liveried van and not work for any other courier company. MPs and unions have argued that these strict conditions mean they are bogusly self-employed and should be treated as employed workers. Courier companies using self-employed drivers, including ParcelForce and UK Mail, have also sparked anger by levying fines if rounds are not covered. DPD said that it charged fines in 4.6% of the cases where couriers did not provide a service, but declined to say how much it raised because this information was \u201coperationally sensitive\u201d. \u201cHow can modern Britain allow workers who are dedicated to their job to be driven to an early grave by such appalling exploitation?\u201d said Field. \u201cDPD have been told time and again that their punitive regime is totally unjust, particularly as their workers are labelled \u2018self-employed\u2019. Such mistreatment of workers smacks of sweated labour from the Victorian era.\u201d",

He wasn\u2019t able to do his parcels first and make the hospital appointments, so he would cancel on the day. <br></p> \n<p>\u201cHe collapsed in January 2017 and they knew that because they collected his van. It was after that Don cancelled three appointments. DPD had a duty of care to make sure he got to those appointments, but they failed in it.\u201d She added that in March her husband had told her: \u201cI think I am going to die.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lane\u2019s death comes as concern mounts at the human cost of the gig economy, which accounts for 1.1 million people, many working as couriers and minicab drivers. It is likely to increase pressure on the government to make meaningful reforms to employment law in a delayed announcement on modern working practices expected this week. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a75af966-af86-408f-9471-0cad57022fb9\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If you have worked in the gig economy and have shared similar concerns to those mentioned in our story, we'd like to hear from you. <br></p>\n    <p>You can share your experiences here via <a href=\"https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/gig_economy_workers_experiences\">our encrypted form</a><a>.</a> Your stories will help our journalists have a more complete picture and we will use some of them in our reporting.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trade unions last night said the government must crack down on bogus self-employment. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe insecure work free-for-all has to end \u2026 this will be a real test of Theresa May\u2019s government. Does she even have a domestic agenda any more?\u201d</p> \n<p>DPD, one of the most successful firms operating in the gig economy, made over \u00a3100m profit after tax in 2016. Both it and Hermes, another parcel company relying on self-employed couriers, are facing employment tribunal claims from people who believe they should be treated as employed. </p> \n<p>Field described Lane\u2019s death as \u201ca new low for the gig economy\u201d and called on Theresa May to urgently introduce new legislation to protect \u201cthis small army of workers at the bottom of the pile \u2026 who are being badly exploited\u201d.</p> \n<p>Lane disputed the \u00a3150 charge in July, insisting that he had told his bosses about the appointment months earlier. According to correspondence seen by the Guardian, he told his manager: \u201cI have cancelled so many appointments because I couldn\u2019t make the time to get there that the renal department have stopped treating me. I had to go.\u201d</p> \n<p>His DPD area manager replied: \u201cI fail to understand why a full day off was required and as such do not see that the breach [the \u00a3150 fine] should be rescinded.\u201d</p> \n<p>During the appointment, doctors found Lane\u2019s blood pressure and cholesterol were high, he had anaemia and rising levels of creatine in his kidneys, a warning sign of renal failure. In September 2017 he collapsed into another diabetic coma.</p> \n<p>In the days before he died, he was feeling sick and vomiting blood, Ruth said, adding that he told her: \u201cI really don\u2019t want to work, but I have to.\u201d. \u201cThey are like employees, not self-employed,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>A colleague, who asked not to be named for fear that DPD would terminate his contract, said: \u201cDon was falling apart, but they wouldn\u2019t take it easy on him. They push drivers till they break. I definitely think they contributed to this. They knew Don was diabetic. They should have looked after him more.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d48f8186-c880-40df-b143-f5fc5280a290\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>DPD drivers are treated as self-employed franchisees and their contract states that if they fail to perform the services requested by DPD, it can charge them \u00a3150 per day \"by way of liquidated damages\", or \u00a375 per half day. This is on top of their lost earnings, because they are only paid per parcel delivered. Drivers can avoid the fine if they can find a substitute, but this is not always possible.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>DPD said in a statement that it was \u201cprofoundly sorry\u201d that it had charged Lane, but cited \u201cconfusion\u201d at the time. \u201cDon attended his appointment, but it isn\u2019t clear why he was then charged, when the charge hadn\u2019t been been applied at any other time,\u201d it said. \u201cWe got it wrong on that occasion.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lane first collapsed on 27 December 2016 and Ruth texted his manager to say: \u201che knows he has to come into work tomorrow as he\u2019ll get charged\u201d. On that occasion, the manager responded that \u201che has no worries about being charged\u201d. </p> \n<p>\u201cIn relation to Don\u2019s poor health at the end of December 2016 and into January 2017, we refute the claim that he was under pressure and threatened with a \u00a3150 charge,\u201d DPD said. It said that it monitored Lane\u2019s health during 2017 but did not know that he had suffered another diabetic coma in September. It said he had a quiet rural route with a relatively small number of deliveries, which suited him \u201cas it was convenient for his hospital appointments\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the runup to Christmas, it is normal in the industry for drivers to work additional days at the weekend and Don was working his normal route,\u201d DPD said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t made aware that Don was feeling sick and vomiting up some blood at this time. We were shocked and hugely saddened by Don\u2019s death and our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this difficult time.\u201d</p> \n<p>DPD said its drivers \u201cdo not have to provide the service personally, and drivers have the option of providing a substitute driver in the event of sickness. Don was aware of the need to provide a substitute.\u201d It said if a driver cannot find a substitute, it tries to reallocate the route among other drivers.</p> \n<p>DPD uses around 5,000 self-employed couriers. They are under pressure to deliver parcels to restricted time slots, must wear a uniform, hire a DPD liveried van and not work for any other courier company. MPs and unions have argued that these strict conditions mean they are bogusly self-employed and should be treated as employed workers. Courier companies using self-employed drivers, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/06/sick-parcelforce-couriers-royal-mail-mands-john-lewis-hamleys-dpdhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/06/sick-parcelforce-couriers-royal-mail-mands-john-lewis-hamleys-dpdhttps://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/06/sick-parcelforce-couriers-royal-mail-mands-john-lewis-hamleys-dpd\">ParcelForce</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/19/uk-mail-driver-unable-to-work-car-accident-charged-800-pounds\">UK Mail</a>, have also sparked anger by levying fines if rounds are not covered.</p> \n<p>DPD said that it charged fines in 4.6% of the cases where couriers did not provide a service, but declined to say how much it raised because this information was \u201coperationally sensitive\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow can modern Britain allow workers who are dedicated to their job to be driven to an early grave by such appalling exploitation?\u201d said Field. \u201cDPD have been told time and again that their punitive regime is totally unjust, particularly as their workers are labelled \u2018self-employed\u2019. Such mistreatment of workers smacks of sweated labour from the Victorian era.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The collapse of Carillion is expected to trigger a rise in the number of construction companies going bust as subcontractors in its supply chain miss out on payment, a leading accountancy firm has warned. Insolvencies in the construction industry increased by 8% to 2,633 last year, according to figures from the Insolvency Service, which is managing the liquidation of Carillion. Insolvency experts at accountants Moore Stephens predicted a further rise in the number of business failures, pointing to the difficulties faced by firms in a sector in which profit margins are typically low. Lee Causer, a partner, said the collapse of Carillion could exacerbate the increase. The forecast comes days after monthly figures for housebuilding activity showed the first fall since just after the EU referendum, with experts warning that the building industry has been rattled by Carillion. Carillion\u2019s former bosses will be questioned by MPs on Tuesday about their management in the run-up to its collapse last month under a mountain of debt as part of a joint inquiry into the collapse by the business, and the work and pensions select committees. Richard Howson, who quit as chief executive after the firm\u2019s first profit warning in July, \u2013 and Philip Nevill Green, who was chairman, are among those called to give evidence. Last week the Federation of Small Businesses accused Carillion of abusing its dominant position to force suppliers to accept late payment. Causer said: \u201cCarillion has already left a huge number of subcontractors out of pocket, when they are already facing enormous financial pressures. The fall of Carillion could be the trigger for even more construction companies going under. \u201cProfit margins in construction are already very tight and late payment of subcontractors is now standard procedure for far too many in the sector.\u201d The number of days that construction firms are waiting on average for payment has risen from 52 five years ago to 69, according to research from small business finance company Funding Options. In the aftermath of Carillion\u2019s collapse, it emerged that the company was making some of its subcontractors wait as long as 120 days for bills to be settled. At least 377 former Carillion staff will be made redundant and the official receiver, which is handling the liquidation, said it was still shifting through contracts that will determine the future of more than 18,000 employees. Rachel Reeves, who chair the business committee, said on Friday that many firms were now facing \u201cpotential ruin\u201d, accusing Carillion\u2019s directors of \u201cruthlessly exploiting their position to bully their contractors in a desperate bid to prop up their precarious business model\u201d. Paul Uppal, the government\u2019s small business commissioner, said last month that legislation may be needed if there was not a \u201ccultural change\u201d in the construction industry to ensure prompt payment. Moore Stephens warned the problems posed by late payment were likely to be exacerbated by increases in import costs, which have risen owing to the fall in sterling after the Brexit vote, as well as the need to plug a skills gap often filled by workers from the EU27 nations.",
