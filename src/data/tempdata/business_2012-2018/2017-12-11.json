      "bodyText": "The closure of a major North Sea pipeline after a crack was discovered will have wide-reaching implications for the oil and gas industry, experts have said. They said even a closure of a few weeks would have significant impacts on the industry. The price of Brent, the international benchmark, briefly rose to a two-year high of above $65 (\u00a347) a barrel after the announcement, up from $63 at the start of the day. Wholesale natural gas prices for same-day delivery in the UK surged by nearly 30% to a four-year high. With Britain facing a cold snap, there is a concern that the higher fuel prices may filter down into more expensive energy bills for consumers. Ineos, which owns the pipeline, said that inspections had found a hairline crack that would require the Forties pipeline to close for weeks, which is expected to cause several oil companies to temporarily cease production. The pipeline system is 235 miles long and connects 85 oil and gas platforms and facilities to the mainland. Ineos, the owner of the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland, which will also be affected by the shutdown, said its contractors found the crack where the pipeline system runs over land near Netherley, south of Aberdeen. The petrochemicals firm said an oil spill response team visited the site last Wednesday. \u201cA 300-metre cordon was set up, a small number of local residents were advised to leave and the pipe was depressurised while a full assessment of the situation was made,\u201d it said. However, the crack has since widened and Ineos took the decision to shut the pipeline in the interests of safety and in an attempt to avoid a serious oil leak. Ineos did not specify exactly how many residents had been temporarily moved. The company said the closure would \u201callow for a suitable repair method to be worked up based on the latest inspection data, while reducing the risk of injury to staff and the environment\u201d. Ineos said a \u201cvery small amount of oil seepage\u201d had been reported, but insisted no oil had been detected entering the wider environment. Fiona Legate, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System, even if only temporarily, would have wide-reaching implications the UK oil and gas industry. Apache, a Texas-based company with operations in the North Sea, said it had ceased production as a result. The Health and Safety Executive said: \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation, as we have since we were made aware of the issues with the pipeline.\u201d The shutdown will be a serious blow for Ineos, which only completed its \u00a3200m purchase of the pipeline system from BP at the end of October. The company had said that it was now the only UK company with refinery and petrochemical assets that were integrated in the North Sea, and would serve as a platform for more investments in the region.",

      "bodyText": "The controversial cuts to Sunday and public holiday penalty rates on 1 July have been followed by the weakest three months of consumer spending since 2008. A new report from the McKell Institute, a Labor-aligned thinktank, has analysed the impact of the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision in February to cut public holiday penalty rates, and begin phasing-in cuts to Sunday penalty rates, for some workers in the retail, hospitality, fast food and pharmacy sectors. Public holiday penalty rates were cut on 1 July \u2013 from 250% to 225% \u2013 for some workers in the hospitality, restaurant, retail, fast food and pharmacy sectors. Sunday penalty rates were also cut for award-rate workers in the hospitality, retail, fast food and pharmacy sectors. The McKell Institute report says there appears to be \u201csome correlation\u201d between the reductions in take-home pay on 1 July and the significant decline in consumer spending in July, August, and September. The September quarter was the first quarter since the 1 July cuts came into effect, and economists have admitted that the fall in consumer spending has been surprisingly large since then. \u201cIt is probably too early to say that this is the beginning of a new trend, but given the unsavoury mix of headwinds facing the consumer at present, alarm bells should be ringing,\u201d warned a JP Morgan economist, Sally Auld. The McKell Institute report, called An Analysis of the Impact of Penalty Rate cuts on National Growth Trends, was released on Tuesday. Its authors say while it is too early to be definitive, it appears the decision to cut penalty rates in July has had a negative impact on the economy. They say proponents of a cut in penalty rates suggested up to 40,000 jobs would be created by the wage reductions over coming years, but the retail industry has not shown any significant rise in employment in the last three months and the accommodation and food services industry has seen a slight reduction in employment. \u201cWhile the changes only started to come into effect on July 1, 2017, there is no evidence of a major surge in employment in the affected industries,\u201d the report says. \u201cDespite claims that penalty rates will increase economic activity, retail turnover has seen a standstill with sales showing 0% growth.\u201d Sam Crosby, the McKell Institute\u2019s executive director, told Guardian Australia most of the people who had their penalty rates cut this year have suffered a \u201cvery real and noticeable impact\u201d on their quality of life. \u201cThat\u2019s because most are on low incomes, so every dollar counts,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are going to introduce a measure that directly hurts low-income earners, you would want to be certain that measure will have a significant offsetting benefit. Our report finds no evidence whatsoever of that benefit. \u201cThere is no evidence of job creation, which proponents of the cuts argued was the whole point. There is, however, evidence of lower household spending, which the McKell Institute argued would be a likely outcome. Crosby said the McKell Institute has had concerns that the primary effect of the penalty rate cuts will be a simple transference of wealth from low-income hospitality workers to business owners and corporate shareholders. \u201cThere is nothing in this first tranche of data that would indicate this is not the case,\u201d he said. In February the Fair Work Commission president, Justice Iain Ross, said Sunday and public holiday rates were no longer a \u201cfair and relevant\u201d safety net for workers, and he agreed with employers that reducing rates could boost employment. He acknowledged cuts to Sunday rates would \u201cinevitably cause some hardship to the employees affected\u201d, but promised transitional arrangements would mitigate that hardship. He decided to cut Sunday rates but to keep them higher than Saturday levels because \u201cSunday work has a higher level of disutility\u201d for workers, although to a lesser extent than in the past. He said evidence from business owners demonstrated that the current level of Sunday rates had led them to restrict trading hours, reduce staff levels and restrict the services provided, and cutting rates would therefore increase trading hours, and the \u201clevel and range of services\u201d on Sunday and public holidays. Small businesses and retailers told the Fair Work Commission that its decision to phase in penalty rate cuts in the hospitality, retail, pharmacy and fast-food sectors over two to three years \u2013 rather than in a single year \u2013 would prevent employment gains happening quickly. On 1 July workers on hospitality and fast-food awards saw their Sunday rates cut from 175% to 170%, to be followed by two more rounds of cuts in 2018 and 2019 (to stop at 150% on 1 July, 2019). Workers on retail and pharmacy awards saw their Sunday rates cut from 200% to 195%, to be followed by three more rounds of cuts in 2018, 2019 and 2020 (to stop at 150% on 1 July, 2020).",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our news story in bitcoin\u2019s debut on the futures markets, and the latest warnings that the crypto-currency is a speculative bubble: That\u2019s a good moment to wrap up. Thanks for reading and commenting. GW As the first day of bitcoin derivatives trading draws to a close, forecasts that it would trigger an immediate wave of selling look wide of the mark. The January 2018 futures contract is trading close to its earlier highs, at around $18,300. That\u2019s up from an opening price of $15,000, and ahead of the \u2018spot\u2019 price - which is closing in on $17,000 tonight. Here\u2019s the situation in Chicago: Here\u2019s a quick explanation of bitcoin futures: Edward Tilly, chairman and chief executive officer at Cboe Global Markets, has spoken to Bloomberg TV about the bitcoin futures launch today. Tilly says it has been \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, with more than 3,000 bitcoin contracts sold on Cboe as market participants get up and running. Apparently there were just 12 registered traders involved with the bitcoin futures market at launch - that has risen to 22 during the trading day. That\u2019s a fairly small pool of traders, frankly, given all the interest in digital currencies. I suspect major investors are treating bitcoin cautiously today, as they watch events unfold.... Just because you can do something, doesn\u2019t mean you should do, right? That mantra applies to bitcoin futures trading as much as anything else. So before you take the plunge, check out Bloomberg\u2019s eight-point list of stuff you need to know: Here\u2019s a flavour: 5. What are the risks? Not everyone thinks derivatives based on bitcoin are ready for prime time. One worry is the volatility that so far has been a key feature of the digital currency market. Just three days before Cboe\u2019s product was slated to be introduced, bitcoin had one of its wildest sessions ever: On Coinbase\u2019s GDAX exchange, prices zoomed up to almost $20,000 from $16,000 in only about 90 minutes, before crashing back down. 6. So are bitcoin futures a bad idea? Some big traders think futures may be premature. The Futures Industry Association -- a group of major banks, brokers and traders -- said the contracts were rushed without enough consideration of the risks. In an open letter to the exchanges, the group questioned whether they would be able to adequately police market manipulation in bitcoin. The group said the exchanges should have sought more industry feedback on margin levels, trading limits and stress tests for the system before beginning trading. Cboe and CME are requiring traders to set aside an unusually large pile of cash to serve as collateral to back purchases. The full article is online here. My colleague Alex Hern has written a handy guide to other digital currencies which might (or might not!) rival bitcoin one day. He insists that it must not be taken as investment advice. And this snippet explains exactly why: PlexCoin, an innovative attempt to build \u201cthe next decentralised worldwide cryptocurrency\u201d, has already raised $15m from backers, so you\u2019d better move fast to \u2013 ah, hang on. No. The founder has just been sent to jail for two months for, among other things, falsehoods on the company\u2019s fundraising documents, as well as taking investor money and using it to fund home improvement..... Naeem Aslam of Think Markets reckons the launch of bitcoin futures has gone pretty smoothly - even though only a few thousand contracts have actually been sold so far today. There are nearly 2900 contracts which have traded for the month of January which by no means can be classified as an anaemic volume but not exactly explosive either. The thought that comes to mind is that the Bitcoin\u2019s spot and futures markets seem stable for now and things are looking much calmer. The spread between the February and January contract has narrowed to $150 which at one point was as high as $2000. This confirms that the volatility has eased off massively and in the coming days, we would not be shocked if the margin requirements are even lowered and the transaction cost reduced. By its recent standards, bitcoin has been notably stable today. The digital currency has been trading around at $16,300 mark for most of the day, a gain of around 10%. The futures contract has been more volatile, though: \u201cOf all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, \u201cIt might have been.\u201d Still, it\u2019s only money, eh? Reuters\u2019 Richard Beales has calculated that the volume of bitcoin future contracts actually traded today is quite modest. He writes: The one-month future surged more than 20 percent from the open before trading below $18,000 on Monday morning \u2013 still a premium to the crypto-currency itself. Considering the price of bitcoin has risen two-thirds this month alone, that seems fairly sedate. Volume was roughly $50 million, Breakingviews calculates, less than 0.5 percent of actual bitcoin trading in the prior 24 hours, according to Coinmarketcap.com. But the market could develop fast, as the CME exchange plans to rival CBOE by launching its own futures trading next Monday. Beales adds: Proponents reckon the entry of two big, regulated U.S. exchanges bolsters the legitimacy of bitcoin. It certainly broadens the universe of possible investors, and it invites the creation of new exchange-traded funds, which need a liquid benchmark to track. That would bring bitcoin exposure to retail investors. Yet the Futures Industry Association, which represents clearing houses and big banks, is apprehensive about the light regulatory scrutiny so far. And making the contracts cash-settled means the exchanges \u2013 and their customers \u2013 can now ride the bitcoin bandwagon without touching the crypto-currency at all. Despite its bumpy start, the new bitcoin futures contract is still trading at a higher level than \u2018spot\u2019 bitcoin. That shows the people trading this new futures contract expect bitcoin to keep rising in value over the next few weeks: However, it\u2019s early days - many major banks are still wary of cryptocurrencies, and have resisted offering bitcoin futures to their own clients. Potential short-sellers (who want to bet against bitcoin) could still be lurking out there... Wall Street has begun the new week calmly, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising by 25 points, or 0.1%, in early trading. Some bitcoin supporters argue that digital currencies could replace gold as a store of value. Now there are signs that investors are selling their gold-backed securities to buy bitcoin instead.... Time for a quick recap, for any US readers joining us (it just turned 7.30am in New York). Bitcoin has taken another step towards the financial mainstream, with the launch of its first derivative contracts in Chicago. But the move has intensified concerns that cryptocurrencies should be tightly controlled, in case they prove to be an unsustainable speculative bubble that ends in tears. The first Bitcoin futures contracts, which will be settled in early 2018, jumped by 25% in early trading overnight -- triggering two circuit-breakers designed to calm volatile markets. Although the number of futures contracts traded was relatively small, today\u2019s debut seems to be going relatively smoothly. These futures contracts can be used to bet against bitcoin, but Here\u2019s the latest pricing, via Reuters: The one-month future is up 13% from the open at $17,450, around $1,000 higher than the \u201cspot\u201d bitcoin price - the price at which bitcoin is currently being bought and sold. The two-month contract is trading at $18,880, while the three-month contract is changing hands at $19,040. Some analysts think the launch of bitcoin futures will legitimise the digital currency as an asset class -- it has already jumped by more than 1,500% this year. But there is also concern that it is being fuelled by unsustainable speculation - and that small investors are being lured to buy bitcoins because they\u2019ve heard it keeps going up. UBS\u2019s Paul Donovan recommends keeping well away, arguing that bitcoin is a bubble whose eventual puncturing can\u2019t be predicted. There are also signs that the political and economic establishment is becoming more concerned. A senior ECB policymaker, Ewald Nowotny, has called for greater scrutiny of bitcoin to prevent it being used for moneylaundering. South Korea\u2019s finance minister has also voiced concerns that bitcoin isn\u2019t being regulated properly. And yesterday, New Zealand\u2019s central bank chief suggested bitcoin looked \u2018remarkably\u2019 like a bubble. A senior policymaker at the European Central Bank has called for bitcoin to be more tightly controlled, to avoid it being used by organised criminals. Ewald Nowotny, who is also Austria\u2019s top central banker, said that the recent jump in bitcoin\u2019s value means tighter controls are needed. Nowotny told a press conference in Vienna this morning: \u201cSimply because of the scale, it is certainly increasingly necessary to discuss whether and in what form regulations are needed here. \u201cA particular aspect that needs to be discussed ...is the question of how far the regulations on money laundering ...are relevant here.\u201d Chicago\u2019s launch of the first bitcoin futures contract could pave the way for other financial products based on cryptocurrencies. Daniele Bianchi, assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, says bitcoin is \u201cgaining more and more legitimacy as an asset class\u201d. Today\u2019s launch of Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) has the potential to add further momentum and thus increase the appeal of the cryptocurrency to both institutional and retail investors. \u201cAs a matter of fact, the introduction of derivatives provides the necessary market structure for institutions to trade on Bitcoins without owning them as, in fact, futures contracts on Bitcoin are cash settled. This will likely lead to the creation of ETFs and other more liquid instruments, potentially increasing market activity and aggregate demand by orders of magnitude. But Britain\u2019s best-known fund manager is seriously unhappy about the bitcoin boom. Neil Woodford has dismissed bitcoin as a modern tulip bulb, saying his firm are \u201cstruggling to find a sensible\u201d explanation for the cryptocurrency\u2019s surge in value this year. Bitcoin is hogging most of the action in the financial markets today. In the City, the FTSE 100 has risen by 45 points - or 0.6% - in a gentle trading session. European markets are more subdued, with France\u2019s CAC index as flat as un cr\u00eape. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx comments: While investors go doolally for bitcoin futures, the more traditional markets were pretty dreary this Monday. The jump in bitcoin futures today has calmed fears of a crash, says Craig Erlam of OANDA: Bitcoin is back trading near record highs this morning, allaying fears for now that the ability to short would trigger a sell-off. The price of a Bitcoin future has dropped back from its early high, but is still up around 17% today. Associated Press has the details: At 3:40 a.m. central time (0940 GMT) on Monday, the futures contract that expires in January was trading at $17,600. It opened at 5 p.m. CST at $15,000 and climbed as high as $18,700 in its first day of trading, according to CBOE Global Markets. We have an early candidate for quote of the day, via Bloomberg. \u201cIt is rare that you see something more volatile than bitcoin, but we found it: bitcoin futures,\u201d said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia. Derivatives allow traders to take a negative view of bitcoin, and profit if its value falls. But... they\u2019re also a way for institutional investors to back digital currencies without having to get to grips with the technical intricacies (such as multiple exchanges, wallets, and occasional reports of bitcoins being stolen by cybercriminals). Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investors, reckons that these new futures contracts could unleash a new flow of funds into bitcoin: There\u2019s never a dull moment where cryptocurrencies are involved. Introducing a bitcoin futures contract in the US gives professional investors and institutions an easier route in, and a fresh surge in value indicates pent up demand. Anything that adds to the asset\u2019s accessibility and legitimacy and reduces security risk often associated with cryptos will improve its credentials as a tradeable asset and so grow the pool of potential investors. Already, rapid and substantial gains on cryptocurrency exchanges have drawn in even seasoned investors, who are now earmarking some portfolio cash for bitcoin. Opportunities to profit from such extreme market conditions, akin to the dotcom boom, are rare indeed, but inevitably come loaded with risk. However, the music may have much longer to play on this one than people think. At around $16,400, Bitcoin has surged by over 1,500% since the start of 2017. That means the combined value of every bitcoin currently in existence is around $274bn -- or more than most major companies (it overtook JP Morgan last week, for example). So would a crash destabilise the financial markets? Not according to Capital Economics, who point out: If the price of bitcoin fell to zero today, the paper losses would be equivalent to a 0.6% fall in US equity prices. As most investors have bought bitcoin at much lower prices, the relevant losses would arguably be smaller But... a major correction could have a damaging knock-on effect if people have borrowed heavily to buy bitcoin, in the hope of making quick gains. Our technology writer Alex Hern has been pondering bitcoin\u2019s future, and tweets: South Korea\u2019s finance minister has revealed today that his government is reviewing whether bitcoin trading should be subjected to fresh regulation. Kim Dong-yeon told reporters in Seoul that: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at its speculative nature, as well as the situation in other countries.... Bitcoin regulation has rocketed up the news agenda in recent weeks, as its price has surged. Last week, it emerged that the UK Treasury was examining whether laws against money laundering should be updated to specifically cover virtual currencies. UBS analyst Paul Donovan has a word of caution for those thinking of betting against bitcoin. Previous bubbles have lasted longer than critics have expected, Donovan points out. So unless you get your timing right, you could be crushed under the stampede of speculative money pushing an asset higher and higher. Here\u2019s how Donovan explains it: Should investors bet against the bubble? That is high risk. UBS believes cryptocurrencies are a bubble. However, being able to short a bubble does not make the bubble burst at once. Cash settled futures contracts on tulip bulbs began in Holland in 1636. The tulip bubble did not burst until February 1637. Bubbles are by definition irrational. Predicting when a bubble will burst cannot use rational analysis. Ignoring a bubble is the best course of action. Or, as John Maynard Keynes put it, \u201cThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\u201d The new bitcoin futures contracts have attracted more attention than expected, says Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM: The initial reaction was beyond expectations with the futures contract climbing more than 20% and triggering two trading halts. CBOE\u2019s website experienced unprecedented traffic which may well have sent a new benchmark; the frenetic activity led to delays and outages. So far, it seems professional investors aren\u2019t willing to bet against the bitcoin, despite the many warnings of a bubble that will burst soon. Many traders aren\u2019t even interested in the price direction, but the listing of the futures contract on CBOE and later next week on the CME, will provide them an arbitrage trading opportunity due to the vast pricing differences. However, the arbitrage trading will lead to improved price efficiency and probably less volatility. After volatility settles down, the focus will return to the price direction. Bitcoin\u2019s rally comes in the face of another warning that the cryptocurrency is a speculative bubble that won\u2019t end well. Yesterday, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand\u2019s acting governor Grant Spencer warned: \u201cIt looks remarkably like a bubble forming to me. \u201cOver the centuries we\u2019ve seen bubbles, and this appears to be a bit of a classic case. With a bubble, you never know how far it\u2019s going to go before it comes down.\u201d In theory, the launch of derivative contracts today should help bitcoin find its true value (as investors will now be able to bet against it)..... Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories, believes bitcoin futures trading will take a few days to bed down. Gottlieb says (via Reuters): \u201cEven if there is an institution or institutional-sized trader out there, they are going to want to make sure that the mechanics work first, just for the futures. I think the excitement will come when the futures market is established. That can take a few days.\u201d But there\u2019s already plenty of interest -- Bitcoin futures have surged by a quarter since trading began late last night. The Guardian\u2019s Business Today email has expanded its property coverage. As well as key news headlines, an agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature, there is now more coverage of house prices, mortgages, the rental market \u2013 and the best picture galleries from our Money pages. For your morning shot of financial and property news, sign up here: CBOE\u2019s circuit breakers have been busy this morning, as bitcoin futures trading began. Bloomberg explains: The first trading halt came about 2 1/2 hours after the session began, while the second one triggered after four hours. Cboe imposes circuit breakers to curb volatility, halting transactions for two minutes if prices rise or fall 10 percent, and for five minutes at 20 percent. Trading will stop for at least five minutes if the rally extends to 30 percent, Cboe said in a notice on its website. Good morning. It\u2019s a red letter day for bitcoin as the cryptocurrency makes its long-anticipated debut on the world\u2019s futures market. For the first time, institutional investors can bet on whether bitcoin will continue to rise in value, or crash back to earth. This could be a watershed moment for digital currencies, moving them closer to the mainstream. There\u2019s already a surge of interest in bitcoin this morning, since the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) launched its futures contract. Bitcoin\u2019s price has surged by up to 25%, forcing CBOE to temporarily halt trading - twice! - to let the volatility cool off. Dealers reported that there is more interest than expected, with a torrent of traffic hitting CBOE\u2019s website. Once the situation calmed down, Bitcoin futures expiring in January are changing hands at $17,780 - up from an opening level of $15,000. That surge in value has pushed bitcoin futures way ahead of the \u2018spot\u2019 price of bitcoin -- ie, how much you\u2019d have to pay for one right now. In other words, investors are anticipating that bitcoin will keep pushing higher. Several major banks have approached the launch of bitcoin futures cautiously, given concerns over the validity of cryptocurrencies. As Associated Press put it: Many larger Wall Street brokerages and clearinghouses, including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, are either not allowing customers to trade bitcoin futures or only allowing select clients to do so. Other brokerages are putting restrictions on the amount of margin a trader can use in bitcoin futures, or putting limits on the amount that can be purchased. The digital currency has had more than its fair share of critics on Wall Street. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin \u201ca fraud.\u201d Thomas Peterffy, chairman of the broker-dealer Interactive Brokers Group, expressed deep concerns about the trading of bitcoin futures last month, saying \u201cthere is no fundamental basis for valuation of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and they may assume any price from one day to the next.\u201d But it could be a volatile day, as traders in London trudge through the snow and sleet to their desks. There\u2019s not much in the economic calendar. European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, with the FTSE 100 being called up around 31 points. We\u2019ll be tracking all the economic and financial news through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Ryanair flights to and from Dublin could be disrupted by strikes over Christmas after pilots based in Ireland voted for industrial action. Europe\u2019s biggest short-haul airline now faces disruption in key European markets following ballots for action by pilots in Italy and Portugal over the past week. A vote by members of the Irish Ialpa union resulted in 79 of 84 voters backing action. While Ialpa represents only some of Ryanair\u2019s Dublin pilots, many of whom are employed via third-party agencies, those who voted are mostly captains, without whom planes cannot fly. However, it has not been decided whether the industrial action will include strikes. The executive committee of Impact, an umbrella union to which Ialpa is affiliated, is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss what shape the protest will take. The ballot was held against the backdrop of increasingly sour relations between Ryanair and its pilots, many of whom are seeking collective bargaining power via a new European employee representative committee (ERC). Ryanair usually deals with multiple European ERCs separately, allowing it to negotiate separate deals on issues such as pay and conditions at 87 different bases. In a letter sent to Ryanair\u2019s chief people officer, Eddie Wilson, on Sunday, the company\u2019s Dublin ERC said this form of industrial relations had failed and condemned a threat to punish striking pilots with cuts to pay and benefits. In the letter, seen by the Guardian, pilots told Wilson that the warning \u201conly proves that respectful and equal negotiations are not possible. This is simply not acceptable behaviour and this counter-productive engagement should stop immediately\u201d. Ryanair said it had received no notification of any industrial action, calling Ialpa an \u201cAer Lingus pilots group\u201d, referring to a rival Dublin-based carrier. \u201cNow that Ryanair\u2019s Cork, Shannon and Belfast bases have agreed 20% pay increases, we expect the Dublin pilots to follow this trend,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, if Ryanair\u2019s Dublin pilots are misled by some Aer Lingus pilots into industrial action then they will lose their favourable rosters [...] and remuneration benefits that are specifically linked by agreement to dealing directly with Ryanair. If any such industrial action occurs Ryanair will still not engage with, or recognise, Aer Lingus pilots or their Ialpa union.\u201d Ryanair has come under increasing pressure from pilots since it announced two waves of cancellations due to an error in scheduling their hours. Pilots are understood to have been emboldened by a belief that the airline is still short of qualified captains and first officers. Ryanair has argued that it is recruiting pilots and there is no threat of a shortage. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "HSBC has avoided the threat of prosecution in the US over allegations that its lax controls allowed Mexican drug traffickers to launder cash through the bank. The risk of a prosecution has been hanging over Britain\u2019s biggest bank for the past five years after it was forced to pay $1.9bn (\u00a31.4bn) to the US authorities to settle claims it allowed \u201cnarcotics traffickers and others to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through HSBC subsidiaries and to facilitate hundreds of millions more in transactions with sanctioned countries\u201d. Five years to the day that the settlement was announced, HSBC said the US Department of Justice would file a motion in the district court in the eastern district of New York to dismiss the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) that had been imposed on the bank at the time. The bank said it had \u201clived up to all of its commitments\u201dunder the DPA and was pleased that the DoJ had recognised its progress in strengthening its compliance with anti-money laundering rules and sanctions rules. The lifting of the DPA is a relief for the bank, its former chairman Douglas Flint and its outgoing chief executive, Stuart Gulliver. Under Gulliver HSBC has spent $1bn on efforts to clean up its business and bolster its compliance operations. Its shares rose almost 2% to 746p on Monday. Under the DPA, the DoJ installed a monitor, American lawyer Michael Cherkasky, in the bank\u2019s operations and he will remain in place until July 2018, exactly five years after he began his oversight of the bank\u2019s operations. At the same time the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority appointed Cherkasky in a similar role on its behalf and HSBC said he would \u201ccontinue in that capacity for a period of time at the FCA\u2019s discretion\u201d. When the DPA was announced, the US had described it as \u201csword of Damocles\u201d hanging over HSBC. According to a report by the US Congress, the bank avoided criminal charges at the time because the then chancellor, George Osborne, had warned it could lead to a financial disaster if the bank lost its licence to operate in the US. Gulliver \u2013 who is leaving HSBC in February after nearly four decades \u2013 said the bank was now able to combat financial crime more effectively than five years ago. \u201cWe are committed to doing our part to protect the integrity of the global financial system, and further improvements to our own capability and contributions toward the partnerships we have established with governments in this area will remain a top priority for the Bank into 2018 and beyond,\u201d said Gulliver, who is being replaced by insider John Flint. The monitor\u2019s role has been mentioned in HSBC\u2019s annual reports \u2013 which spell out any risks facing the bank \u2013 and in February it admitted he had raised concerns that had sparked an FCA investigation into to potential breaches of money laundering rules. In recent months, the Guardian reported that the monitor had also been informed about alleged ties between the wealthy Gupta family and the South African president, Jacob Zuma. Concerns were raised by former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain, and HSBC said it had closed bank accounts held by \u201cfront companies\u201d associated with the Guptas. HSBC was subject to further scrutiny of its activities after the Guardian and other publications revealed in 2015 that the bank\u2019s Swiss operations had helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets. This followed the leak of documents of 30,000 accounts that covering the period 2005-07. Rival bank Standard Chartered was subject to a DPA at the same time as HSBC and last month admitted it was being extended for a second time to July 2018. Ian Gordon, an analyst at financial firm Investec, said: \u201cIt is clearly a relief that the DPA has not been extended in contrast to Standard Chartered. It will also potentially lead to an annual monitor-related cost saving of \u00a3200m but not yet as the D0J monitor remains in place until July 2018 \u2026 and this could be extended by the FCA.\u201d \u2022Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The most anticipated knee in the groin in modern business history appears to have been dodged after Sir Richard Branson and Willie Walsh both claimed to have won a bet placed five years ago over Virgin Atlantic\u2019s future. Disappointingly for aviation industry observers, a rendezvous to settle a spat that developed across two continents in 2012 appears to be off. At the time, Walsh \u2013 the chief executive of British Airways\u2019 parent company, International Airlines Group \u2013 made comments suggesting that the Virgin Atlantic brand could disappear after US company Delta bought a 49% stake. Branson proposed a \u00a31m bet that Virgin would still exist in five years. Walsh said he would accept on the basis he was suggesting Branson would no longer be in control of the airline \u2013 and that the stake be modified to a knee in the groin, arguing that \u00a31m would not be a painful loss for the Virgin boss. While Branson said he would accept the new stakes, it is not clear that he took the bet on Walsh\u2019s terms. On Monday, he declared on his blog that the five years was up and he was the winner. He said: \u201cAlthough people might be amused to see me give Willie a low blow, I ideally have no wish to do so. \u201cSo to settle this matter once and for all, and in the spirit of Christmas, I suggest he donates \u00a31m to Virgin Atlantic\u2019s team.\u201d Branson said he would still be prepared to knee Walsh in the groin if the money was not forthcoming. However, Walsh\u2019s view is that he is the winner, after Branson sold his controlling stake in Virgin Atlantic to Air France-KLM in July this year, a deal that reduces his share in the airline from 51% to 20%. Walsh said: \u201cWhen Richard Branson sold out to Delta five years ago, he said he would never give up control. As everyone knows, he no longer owns or controls the business, a reality confirmed by the decision to sell more of his shares to Air France. He\u2019s lost the bet.\u201d Questioned on whether Walsh would be demanding satisfaction, an IAG spokeswoman declined to comment. A Virgin spokesperson accused Walsh of \u201ctrying to wriggle out\u201d, and said Branson remained technically the winner as the Air France-KLM deal would not complete until next year: \u201cAs of today, five years on, we still own and control 51% of Virgin Atlantic, appoint the majority of directors and the chairman of the board.\u201d The wager, which came after decades of bad blood between Virgin and British Airways, originated when Walsh told reporters on a flight to South Korea in December 2012 that the Delta deal could spell the end of the Virgin brand. Branson then wrote: \u201dWill BA never learn? Let\u2019s see how much they believe this. Let them put their money where their mouth is \u2026 I will pay \u00a31m to their staff if Virgin Atlantic disappears within, say, five years. If not, BA pays our staff \u00a31m.\u201d Walsh, in Seoul, responded: \u201cIf he wants to say he will be owning it in five years\u2019 time in its current form, then that would be an interesting bet to accept.\u201d Branson replied on his blog that he would be happy to accept. In the absence of binding arbitration on the matter, it appears both men may emerge with manhood, if not dignity, intact. Branson offered Walsh lunch \u201conce this is over\u201d, a prospect that looks as remote as that knee in the groin.",

Walsh said he would accept on the basis he was suggesting Branson would no longer be in control of the airline \u2013 and that the stake be modified to a knee in the groin, arguing that \u00a31m would not be a painful loss for the Virgin boss.</p> <p>While Branson said he would accept the new stakes, it is not clear that he took the bet on Walsh\u2019s terms. On Monday, <a href=\"https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/virgin-atlantic-still-flying-high-you-bet\">he declared on his blog</a> that the five years was up and he was the winner. He said: \u201cAlthough people might be amused to see me give Willie a low blow, I ideally have no wish to do so. </p> <p>\u201cSo to settle this matter once and for all, and in the spirit of Christmas, I suggest he donates \u00a31m to Virgin Atlantic\u2019s team.\u201d</p> <p>Branson said he would still be prepared to knee Walsh in the groin if the money was not forthcoming.</p> <p>However, Walsh\u2019s view is that he is the winner, after Branson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/27/richard-branson-cedes-control-of-virgin-atlantic\">sold his controlling stake in Virgin Atlantic to Air France-KLM</a> in July this year, a deal that reduces his share in the airline from 51% to 20%. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b97d6c94c279dfa04f568028d3c7b0d8c1ea711d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b97d6c94c279dfa04f568028d3c7b0d8c1ea711d/0_85_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Willie Walsh: \u2018Branson no longer owns or controls Virgin Atlantic \u2026 he lost the bet.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willie Walsh: \u2018Branson no longer owns or controls Virgin Atlantic \u2026 he lost the bet.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walsh said: \u201cWhen Richard Branson sold out to Delta five years ago, he said he would never give up control. As everyone knows, he no longer owns or controls the business, a reality confirmed by the decision to sell more of his shares to Air France. He\u2019s lost the bet.\u201d</p> <p>Questioned on whether Walsh would be demanding satisfaction, an IAG spokeswoman declined to comment.</p> <p>A Virgin spokesperson accused Walsh of \u201ctrying to wriggle out\u201d, and said Branson remained technically the winner as the Air France-KLM deal would not complete until next year: \u201cAs of today, five years on, we still own and control 51% of Virgin Atlantic, appoint the majority of directors and the chairman of the board.\u201d</p> <p>The wager, which came after decades of bad blood between Virgin and British Airways, originated when Walsh told reporters on a flight to South Korea in December 2012 that the Delta deal could spell the end of the Virgin brand. Branson then wrote: \u201dWill BA never learn? Let\u2019s see how much they believe this. Let them put their money where their mouth is \u2026 I will pay \u00a31m to their staff if Virgin Atlantic disappears within, say, five years. If not, BA pays our staff \u00a31m.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Walsh, in Seoul, responded: \u201cIf he wants to say he will be owning it in five years\u2019 time in its current form, then that would be an interesting bet to accept.\u201d</p> <p>Branson replied on his blog that he would be happy to accept. </p> <p>In the absence of binding arbitration on the matter, it appears both men may emerge with manhood, if not dignity, intact. Branson offered Walsh lunch \u201conce this is over\u201d, a prospect that looks as remote as that knee in the groin.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Billions of pounds have been laundered through the City of London, despite Britain remaining one of the safest and cleanest places in the world to do business, the home secretary has said. Amber Rudd issued the warning as she announced plans for a new national economic crime centre, with the power to task the Serious Fraud Office to investigate the worst cases of fraud, money laundering and corruption. The national economic crime centre will be based within the National Crime Agency and will oversee the national police response to financial crime, backed by greater intelligence and analytical capabilities. The move, which will include naming a Home Office minister responsible for tackling economic crime, is part of a revised anti-corruption strategy published on Monday that targets \u201ccorrupt insiders\u201d in sectors including policing, prisons and border force, and pledges greater transparency over who owns and controls businesses to improve trust in Britain as a place to do business. The Guardian\u2019s disclosure of the Panama Papers has already led to the creation of a government taskforce using the data to improve official understanding of the complex and opaque structures used to mask offshore tax evasion. The revised strategy document says that by October, a joint financial analysis centre had opened civil and criminal investigations into more than 66 individuals for suspected tax evasion. The latest official figures suggest that \u00a390bn a year in crime proceeds are laundered each year in Britain, including money from large-scale drug dealing and people trafficking. It is also estimated that fraud costs a further \u00a36.8bn a year \u2013 the equivalent of \u00a3225 a household. The home secretary said: \u201cToday we are taking action against economic crime, and by that I mean the high-level crime, the billions that have been laundered through the City of London, making sure we reduce that and we are very clear we expect higher standards of integrity in this country. \u201cBut [it is] also about everyday economic crime that affects everybody. I don\u2019t know a single person who doesn\u2019t know somebody who knows somebody who has been the victim of some sort of online fraud. On those two elements, high-level economic crime and everyday economic crime, we\u2019re taking action to make sure we reduce it in this country,\u201d said Rudd. She will personally chair a new economic crime strategy board to drive action and Conservative MP John Penrose has been appointed the \u201canti-corruption champion\u201d by the prime minister. Rudd stressed that economic crime was not victimless. Among the victims was Karen Mackie from Aldershot, Hampshire, who lost her solicitors practice and her home after she fell prey to a phishing scam whereby fraudsters pretending to be from her bank phoned and asked about an issue with her accounts. The 56-year-old was told to hang up and ring the number on the back of her card, but the scammers had kept the line open and, in the belief she was through to the anti-fraud team at Natwest, did as she was instructed, transferring thousands of pounds into the criminals\u2019 accounts. \u201cI became quite ill afterwards as a result of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI lost my practice because my insurance wouldn\u2019t pay out, as it turned out they were in financial difficulty. In other circumstances, the insurance company of the solicitors have paid out. We subsequently lost our home this year. The long-term effects just continue.\u201d The government\u2019s new, more robust approach to money laundering, bribery and corruption includes new powers for the national economic crime centre to coordinate the private sector response as well as directly task the SFO. The revised strategy sets out six priorities, including: reducing the insider threat in high-risk domestic sectors; strengthening Britain as a financial centre; reducing corruption in public procurement and grants; and improving the business environment globally. \u201cTo secure our future prosperity, we must do all that we can to make sure that Britain remains one of the safest and cleanest places in the world to do business,\u201d said Rudd. \u201cOur security and prosperity are inextricably linked. As the UK prepares to leave the EU, we have an opportunity to leverage our reputation for integrity and fair play as we establish new trading relationships.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest businesses are warning the economy will remain in the slow lane, as uncertainty from Brexit puts their investment plans on ice despite progress with Brussels. The interjection by British Chambers of Commerce comes before a meeting of Bank of England\u2019s rate-setting committee this week. The BCC have told ministers they now need to finalise a transitional deal to smooth the Brexit process before firms will increase spending on staff and production capacity, despite the breakthrough last week that moved talks with the rest of the EU on to trade. The lobby group said tepid investment levels, weak wage growth and high inflation would lead Threadneedle Street to keep interest rates on hold until the final months of 2019, far later than most expectations. The BCC downgraded its growth outlook for this year from 1.6% to 1.5%, while forecasting a slowdown to 1.1% from 1.2% in 2018. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is meeting for the first time since raising the cost of borrowing in November \u2013 the first rise in interest rates in a decade. The MPC is expected to keep rates on hold at 0.5% on Thursday, although economists will be looking for any clues for when the next rise will come at a time of slowing economic growth. Adam Marshall, BCC director general, said: \u201cDespite last week\u2019s deal, Brexit uncertainty still lingers over business communities, and is undermining many firms\u2019 investment decisions and confidence. \u201cDespite pockets of resilience and success, and strong results for some UK firms, the bigger picture is one of slow economic growth amid uncertain trading conditions.\u201d Business investment in technology and in training for employees is key for driving up economic output as well as productivity, which has been sluggish since the financial crisis \u2013 a major cause of low rates of wage growth for UK workers. The government has launched an industrial strategy as well as more funding for skills and research at the budget last month in response. The MPC decision, due at midday on Thursday, will follow fresh inflation, jobs and wages figures on Tuesday and Wednesday, which are expected to confirm that the squeeze on British households\u2019 spending power is yet to dissipate. The weak pound since the Brexit vote last year is still pushing up the cost of imported goods, while wages are failing to grow above the rate of inflation, despite the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s. The consumer price index measure of inflation stood at 3% in October, confounding an expectation for prices to rise further. City economists reckon the CPI will hold steady in November when the figures are released on Tuesday, helping the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, to avoid writing a letter to the chancellor \u2013 which he must do when CPI is more than a percentage point above or below Threadneedle Street\u2019s 2% target. Analysts at Goldman Sachs say progress in the Brexit talks last week is unlikely to encourage the Bank to move any faster towards higher interest rates, given that the MPC\u2019s economic outlook assumes a transitional period. The investment bank reckons there will be three rate rises by mid-2020, with the next one towards the end of next year. Some economists expect the MPC will next vote for a rate increase as early as May, while others see the next rise coming later in the year. The Bank has a balancing act to strike between keeping inflation in check to protect consumers from the rising cost of living, and also providing enough stimulus to encourage economic growth. The central bank\u2019s actions will come in a week when the European Central Bank is also expected to keep interest rates on hold for the eurozone and the Federal Reserve is expected to raise the cost of borrowing as the economy of the US powers ahead at twice the pace of the UK\u2019s. The Fed rate is expected to raise from 1.25% to 1.5%, while the ECB is expected to keep its main rate at 0%. The Fed meeting will be a landmark one \u2013 it is the final appearance for Janet Yellen as chair before she hands over to Jerome Powell, who was picked by Donald Trump to replace her.",

Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to \u201ctake back control\u201d of laws, borders and money&nbsp;would not have been fulfilled. This&nbsp;is an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>The Norway model</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels \u2013 but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A \u201cNorway-minus\u201d deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access.

But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to diverge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other \u201cnon-tariff barriers\u201d to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May\u2019s direction so far.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>No deal</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business \u2013 a very different future and a lot of disruption.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The lobby group said tepid investment levels, weak wage growth and high inflation would lead Threadneedle Street to keep interest rates on hold until the final months of 2019, far later than most expectations. The BCC downgraded its growth outlook for this year from 1.6% to 1.5%, while forecasting a slowdown to 1.1% from 1.2% in 2018.</p> \n<p>The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee is meeting for the first time since raising the cost of borrowing in November \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/02/bank-of-england-raises-uk-interest-rates-brexit-inflation\">the first rise in interest rates in a decade</a>. The MPC is expected to keep rates on hold at 0.5% on Thursday, although economists will be looking for any clues for when the next rise will come at a time of slowing economic growth.</p> \n<p>Adam Marshall, BCC director general, said: \u201cDespite last week\u2019s deal, Brexit uncertainty still lingers over business communities, and is undermining many firms\u2019 investment decisions and confidence.</p> \n<p>\u201cDespite pockets of resilience and success, and strong results for some UK firms, the bigger picture is one of slow economic growth amid uncertain trading conditions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Business investment in technology and in training for employees is key for driving up economic output as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/productivity\">productivity</a>, which has been sluggish since the financial crisis \u2013 a major cause of low rates of wage growth for UK workers. The government has launched an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/27/clark-details-industrial-strategy-productivity-business-watchdog-white-paper\">industrial strategy</a> as well as more funding for skills and research at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/budget\">budget</a> last month in response.</p> \n<p>The MPC decision, due at midday on Thursday, will follow fresh inflation, jobs and wages figures on Tuesday and Wednesday, which are expected to confirm that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/inflation\">squeeze on British households\u2019 spending power</a> is yet to dissipate. The weak pound since the Brexit vote last year is still pushing up the cost of imported goods, while wages are failing to grow above the rate of inflation, despite the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid-1970s.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/27/business-leaders-urge-government-to-create-productivity-watchdog\">Business leaders urge government to create productivity watchdog</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The consumer price index measure of inflation stood at 3% in October, confounding an expectation for prices to rise further. City economists reckon the CPI will hold steady in November when the figures are released on Tuesday, helping the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, to avoid writing a letter to the chancellor \u2013 which he must do when CPI is more than a percentage point above or below Threadneedle Street\u2019s 2% target. </p> \n<p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs say progress in the Brexit talks last week is unlikely to encourage the Bank to move any faster towards higher interest rates, given that the MPC\u2019s economic outlook assumes a transitional period. The investment bank reckons there will be three rate rises by mid-2020, with the next one towards the end of next year. </p> \n<p>Some economists expect the MPC will next vote for a rate increase as early as May, while others see the next rise coming later in the year. The Bank has a balancing act to strike between keeping inflation in check to protect consumers from the rising cost of living, and also providing enough stimulus to encourage economic growth. </p> \n<p>The central bank\u2019s actions will come in a week when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/european-central-bank\">European Central Bank</a> is also expected to keep interest rates on hold for the eurozone and the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Federal Reserve</a> is expected to raise the cost of borrowing as the economy of the US powers ahead at twice the pace of the UK\u2019s.
