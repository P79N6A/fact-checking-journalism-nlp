      "bodyText": "Japan will switch off its last nuclear reactor on Monday, amid fears that a growing dependence on gas imports there could push up electricity bills in the UK. Kansai Electric Power's only functioning reactor was scheduled to be disconnected from the power grid and then shut for planned maintenance, ending hopes that an industry that until three years ago provided 30% of the electricity to power the world's third largest economy would stage a quick recovery. Continuing problems at the Fukushima plant, where radioactive water has continued to spill into the sea, and a reluctance by voters to back what looks like a badly managed industry, have led to more than 50 nuclear plants being closed, sending Japanese imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) back to levels last seen after the 2011 tsunami. Energy analysts said that Japan's shutdown, combined with Germany's commitment to end nuclear power production by 2022, was pushing up gas prices on the international markets. Rising demand for gas combined with the cost of subsidies for renewable energy, much of which is added to household and business bills, is expected to push up energy prices in the west. According to the CBI, there is a growing unease among UK businesses that energy costs look likely to rise. A survey and report published by the business lobby group the CBI found that around 95% of British business leaders are worried about the cost of energy and that more than three-quarters of them have little faith that matters will improve in the next five years. The pessimistic view about government policy \u2013 and inaction \u2013 may be related to the way in which energy has overtaken transport as the chief area of concern among the 526 executives polled by the CBI and the business services firm KPMG. \"The huge number of businesses concerned about energy supply and costs is alarming,\" said John Cridland, the CBI's director general. \"The government must get the energy bill on to the statute books and bring forward secondary legislation to give potential investors the certainty to deliver the energy infrastructure we need to keep our lights on.\" German businesses have complained that they pay the highest energy bills in the EU following the pioneering decision to subsidise renewable production. Much of the subsidy cost is passed on through higher bills, forcing major manufacturers BMW, Mercedes and Siemens to pay double the cost of electricity in the US. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has promised to cut subsidies to solar and wind farm operators, but has yet to specify the size of the cut or the timescale. It is also unclear what will replace the more environmentally friendly forms of electricity if operators are discouraged from further investments by lower subsidies. At the moment Germany and the UK have dramatically increased their consumption of coal and gas to make up the shortfall from nuclear production. At their conference in Glasgow, the Liberal Democrats said the prospect of rising gas prices meant it was necessary for the UK to back further investment in nuclear power. The UK's trade deficit widened in 2003 when the country became a net importer of oil and gas, and the situation is projected to deteriorate as production falls over the next 10 years. Japan, which ran huge trade surpluses until the Fukishima disaster, has seen its balance of payments thrown into reverse by the costs of purchasing LNG. Japan consumes about a third of the world's LNG and it is likely that demand will grow to record levels over the next couple of years. LNG imports rose 4.4% to a record 86m tonnes, and 14.9% in value to a record 6.21tn yen (\u00a339bn) in the year to March. Imports are likely to rise to around 88m tonnes this year and around 90m tonnes in the year to March 2015, according to projections by the Institute of Energy Economics Japan, based on 16 reactors being back online by March 2015. Thirty months on from the Fukushima disaster, such is the level of public concern about nuclear safety that the government is struggling to come up with a long-term energy policy \u2013 a delay that is having a profound impact on the economy and underlining just how costly a nuclear-power-free future may be. \"There's talk the Abe administration is putting heavy pressure on the regulator [to restart reactors],\" said Osamu Fujisawa, a Japanese-based independent oil economist. \"It's obviously the economy the administration is [concerned about] [rather than safety].

    "webTitle": "Bernanke set to begin Fed's tapering of QE \u2013 but is the US economy ready?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "As Barack Obama gears up to announce Ben Bernanke's successor, the Federal Reserve chairman is expected to make the deeply symbolic gesture this week of announcing the beginning of the end of quantitative easing \u2013 the drastic depression-busting policy that has led the Fed to pump an extraordinary $85bn (\u00a354bn) a month into financial markets. It will signal the Fed's belief that the US economy is on the mend, but it could also frighten the markets and hit interest rates. So what exactly is Bernanke doing, why now \u2013 and how might it affect the UK and other countries? What will the Federal Reserve do? After on Tuesday and Wednesday's regular policy meeting, the Fed is widely expected to announce that it will start to \"taper\" its $85bn-a-month quantitative easing (QE) programme, perhaps cutting its monthly purchases of assets such as government bonds by $10bn or $15bn. Is that good news? It should be: it means the governors of the Fed, led by the chairman, Bernanke, believe the US economy is strong enough to stand on its own, without support from a constant flow of cheap, electronically created money \u2013 though they still have no plans to raise base interest rates from the record low of 0.25%, and they expect to stop adding to QE over a period of up to a year. \"We really want to see a situation where central banks should not be pumping money into markets. It's not a healthy thing to be doing,\" says Chris Williamson, chief economist at data provider Markit. Why are they doing it now? Economic data is pointing to a modest but steady recovery. House prices have turned, rising by 12% in the year to June. Unemployment has fallen to 7.3%, its lowest level since the end of 2008, albeit partly because many women and retirees have left the workforce. Since QE on such a huge scale carries its own risks \u2013 it can distort financial markets, for example \u2013 the Fed is keen to withdraw it once it thinks an upturn is well underway. However, some recent data, including worse-than-expected retail sales figures on Friday, have raised doubts about the health of the upturn. There's another reason too: Bernanke's term as governor ends in January next year, and he may feel that at least making a start on the process of tapering \u2013 marking the beginning of the end of the policy emergency that started more than five years ago \u2013 would be a fitting end to his tenure. How will the markets react? With a shrug, the Fed hopes, since it has carefully communicated its intentions. Scotiabank's Alan Clarke said: \"I think it's pretty much priced in ... Speculation began months ago, the market has already moved and we are still seeing some very robust data. The foot is on the accelerator pedal just a bit more lightly.\" However, a larger-than-expected move could still cause ripples \u2013 and a decision not to taper at all would be a shock, though some analysts believe it remains a possibility. Paul Ashworth, US economist at Capital Economics, said: \"I don't think they've actually decided on this ahead of time.\" What will investors be looking for? First, the scale of the reduction in asset purchases. No taper at all might suggest Bernanke and his colleagues have lingering concerns about the health of the economy; a reduction of $20bn a month or more would come as a shock. The tone of the statement, and the chairman's subsequent press conference, will also be scrutinised, with markets hoping for reassurance that even once tapering is underway, there is no immediate plan to raise interest rates: Bernanke has previously said he doesn't expect this to take place until unemployment has fallen to 6.5% or below. Williamson said: \"I think they will accompany the announcement with a very dovish statement designed not to scare people that the economy is too weak but to reassure stimulus won't be taken away too quickly.\" What does it mean for the UK? Long-term interest rates in UK markets have risen sharply since the early summer, at least in part because of the Fed's announcement on tapering, and that shift, which has a knock-on effect on some mortgage and other loan rates, is likely to continue as the stimulus is progressively withdrawn. If tapering occurs without setting off a market crash or choking off recovery, it may help to reassure policymakers in the UK that they can tighten policy once the recovery gets firmly under way, without sparking a renewed crisis. David Kern, economic adviser to the British Chamber of Commerce, said: \"it will strengthen for me the argument against doing more QE in the UK.\" How will the eurozone be affected? It could cut both ways: a strengthening US economy is a welcome market for Europe's exporters, and if the value of the dollar increases against the euro on the prospect of higher interest rates, that will make eurozone goods cheaper. However, the prospect of an end to QE in the US has also caused bond yields in all major markets to rise, pushing up borrowing costs \u2013 including for many governments. That could make life harder for countries such as Spain and Italy that are already in a fiscal tight spot. What about emerging markets? Back in May, Bernanke merely had to moot the idea of ending QE to send emerging markets reeling. A side-effect of the unprecedented flood of cheap money under QE has been that banks and other investors have used the cash to make riskier investments in emerging markets. The prospect of that tap being turned off has already seen capital pouring out of emerging markets and currencies, potentially exposing underlying weaknesses in economies that have been flourishing on a ready supply of cheap credit. \"It has triggered all sorts of significant movements around the world out of emerging markets. It's had big ramifications for India and other parts of Asia,\" said Clarke. Central banks in Brazil and India have been forced to take action to shore up their currencies; Turkey and Indonesia also look vulnerable. Many of these markets have looked calmer in recent weeks, but the concrete fact of tapering could set off a fresh panic.",

My guess is that by 2020 the company will have fallen into the hands of private equity who, by 2023, will have burdened it with debt to line their pockets so that by 2025 the company is struggling to provide the universal delivery service. Next the owners will go to the government and request a subsidy and, since government believes that the country still needs such a provision, they will reluctantly agree.</p> <p>If this government believes the UK must have a universal postal delivery service, they will, in the last resort, have to guarantee it. If that is their belief then they're crackers to privatise Royal Mail because at sometime in the future the government of the day will be had. Better to turn Royal Mail into a guarantee company, transfer all the assets and hence the company can borrow against those assets. In any case, if it is currently making money, does it really need to borrow? The decision to privatise is just an ill-judged move to raise a few quid.<br><strong>Tony Ward</strong><br><em>Loughborough, Leicestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008Not only are Vince Cable and his fellow Lib Dems in government lending weight to this questionable and potentially destructive policy, but they are acceding to the pernicious provisions of the Postal Services Act 2011, which facilitates the abandonment of the universal service obligation by 2021. That such a course is likely to provoke a potentially counter-productive and suicidal strike by members of the CWU adds a further twist to this unfolding tragedy. For those of us who were once members of the Liberal party, and who have extended electoral support for Cable in his Twickenham constituency through four elections, it seems like the final act of betrayal. Whatever happened to the 2010 manifesto aim \"to hard-wire fairness into national life\"?<br><strong>Paul Velluet</strong><br><em>Twickenham, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Please don't let Vince Cable get away with the claim that the privatised postal service here in Belgium is a success (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/royal-mail-sale-vandalism-jobs-pay\" title=\"\">Comment</a>, 13 September). Large numbers of post offices have been and are being closed. Postal workers are being offered very short-term contracts, and lumbered with increasing workloads. This is disastrous for the workers, and for anyone hoping for post to arrive, since many mistakes are made when deliverers are overworked, rushed and often unfamiliar with the delivery area. There is nobody here I've spoken to who is happy with this privatised service. Cable must have been speaking to someone who is profiting from it.<br><strong>Kate Read</strong><br><em>Kraainem, Belgium</em></p> <p>\u2022 When I read that Michael Fallon said Royal Mail must be sold so it could borrow private money (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/12/royal-mail-strikes-privatisation\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 13 September), I thought: \"Surely it cannot be beyond the wit of man to devise a scheme where they could do this and still remain in public ownership.\" Then I moved on to the next article (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/13/lehman-brothers-collapse-five-years-later-shiver-spine#history-link-box\" title=\"\">Five years on from Lehman: 'We had almost no control'</a>) and realised that, yes, it could be beyond the wit of the men who run our country.<br><strong>Laurie Moye</strong><br><em>Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I don't understand why the Royal Mail can't access the capital markets and enjoy true financial freedom yet remain in public ownership.

Can someone explain?<br><strong>Josh Berle</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 Financial pundits are already predicting \"big dividend cheques\" for investors in the Royal Mail privatisation. For what? Parking money in a share account? With low-paid postal workers' wages subsidised by tax credits and housing benefit, and pension-fund liability remaining with the state, this natural monopoly, buoyed by internet fulfilment business, could hardly fail to make a profit. Previous privatisations \u2013 such as British Gas \u2013 saw small investors' shares quickly acquired by big funds happy to collude with whatever the board desired. Expect big bonuses, the \"rationalisation\" of assets, including sorting offices, and people in rural areas forced to collect their mail from post offices in distant towns, as is the case in parts of North America.

      "bodyText": "I fear that your future scenario for Royal Mail (Editorial, 13 September) is over-optimistic. My guess is that by 2020 the company will have fallen into the hands of private equity who, by 2023, will have burdened it with debt to line their pockets so that by 2025 the company is struggling to provide the universal delivery service. Next the owners will go to the government and request a subsidy and, since government believes that the country still needs such a provision, they will reluctantly agree. If this government believes the UK must have a universal postal delivery service, they will, in the last resort, have to guarantee it. If that is their belief then they're crackers to privatise Royal Mail because at sometime in the future the government of the day will be had. Better to turn Royal Mail into a guarantee company, transfer all the assets and hence the company can borrow against those assets. In any case, if it is currently making money, does it really need to borrow? The decision to privatise is just an ill-judged move to raise a few quid. Tony Ward Loughborough, Leicestershire \u2022\u2008Not only are Vince Cable and his fellow Lib Dems in government lending weight to this questionable and potentially destructive policy, but they are acceding to the pernicious provisions of the Postal Services Act 2011, which facilitates the abandonment of the universal service obligation by 2021. That such a course is likely to provoke a potentially counter-productive and suicidal strike by members of the CWU adds a further twist to this unfolding tragedy. For those of us who were once members of the Liberal party, and who have extended electoral support for Cable in his Twickenham constituency through four elections, it seems like the final act of betrayal. Whatever happened to the 2010 manifesto aim \"to hard-wire fairness into national life\"? Paul Velluet Twickenham, Middlesex \u2022 Please don't let Vince Cable get away with the claim that the privatised postal service here in Belgium is a success (Comment, 13 September). Large numbers of post offices have been and are being closed. Postal workers are being offered very short-term contracts, and lumbered with increasing workloads. This is disastrous for the workers, and for anyone hoping for post to arrive, since many mistakes are made when deliverers are overworked, rushed and often unfamiliar with the delivery area. There is nobody here I've spoken to who is happy with this privatised service. Cable must have been speaking to someone who is profiting from it. Kate Read Kraainem, Belgium \u2022 When I read that Michael Fallon said Royal Mail must be sold so it could borrow private money (Report, 13 September), I thought: \"Surely it cannot be beyond the wit of man to devise a scheme where they could do this and still remain in public ownership.\" Then I moved on to the next article (Five years on from Lehman: 'We had almost no control') and realised that, yes, it could be beyond the wit of the men who run our country. Laurie Moye Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire \u2022 I don't understand why the Royal Mail can't access the capital markets and enjoy true financial freedom yet remain in public ownership. The same clearly doesn't apply to RBS and Lloyds, and didn't while Northern Rock sojourned at the taxpayer's pleasure. Can someone explain? Josh Berle London \u2022 Financial pundits are already predicting \"big dividend cheques\" for investors in the Royal Mail privatisation. For what? Parking money in a share account? With low-paid postal workers' wages subsidised by tax credits and housing benefit, and pension-fund liability remaining with the state, this natural monopoly, buoyed by internet fulfilment business, could hardly fail to make a profit. Previous privatisations \u2013 such as British Gas \u2013 saw small investors' shares quickly acquired by big funds happy to collude with whatever the board desired. Expect big bonuses, the \"rationalisation\" of assets, including sorting offices, and people in rural areas forced to collect their mail from post offices in distant towns, as is the case in parts of North America. Meanwhile the Post Office's current \u00a380m contribution to the exchequer will flow into private pockets. This is simply white-collar theft. Dave Young London",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Tyrie, the combative chair of the Treasury select committee, worries his constituents are confused about the likelihood of an interest rate rise. Last week he asked the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, whether the policy of forward guidance is one they could possibly understand \"down at the Dog and Duck\". At face value it's a reasonable question. The policy, which previously stuck to keeping inflation at 2% over a two to three-year horizon, has morphed into a dual inflation and unemployment tracker with the emphasis on the latter. Where does that leave inflation, the MPs asked. The answer was not clear to them. In one sense, Carney could not care less about MPs and their attempts to pick apart the nuances of his policy. As he stated before his much-trumpeted arrival in July, he wants to talk over the heads of the media and parliament to the people, and as far as he is concerned the people understand very well what he means. Forward guidance is simple. It says interest rates will not rise before the economic recovery brings unemployment down from 7.7% at present to 7%. More than 750,000 jobs will need to be created to reach this threshold. There are three so-called knock-outs that can derail the monetary policy committee's plan. The first two relate to inflation and force the MPC to check that prices are not expected to rise annually by more than 2.5% over a two-year period and that expectations of inflation \"remain sufficiently well anchored\". The third is a judgment by the regulator that the economy is far from a repeat of the 2008 meltdown. From the way Carney spoke last week, there is little chance of a knock-out blow pushing him off course. He thinks the economy's underlying situation is weak, wage rises remain below inflation, household debt remains high, savings are low and the coalition, which is on course to double the national debt by the next election from the \u00a3700bn it inherited, is in no position to help. In this environment, he is unlikely to raise rates even when 750,000 jobs have been created. Listening to him carefully only reinforced this interpretation. He talked about the need to raise productivity, which has remained low while employers retain staff and substitute investment in expensive new machinery and hi-tech kit for cheaper labour. This trick is unsustainable. For employers to pay higher wages they will need higher productivity. And higher wages are needed before living standards improve \u2013 and only when that occurs will the UK economy face significant inflationary pressures. Although he never used the term, Carney is keen on core inflation. He seems prepared to ignore elements of inflation that are deemed temporary or a shock that will quickly work its way through the figures. The MPC has dismissed oil price rises, government tax rises and university tuition fee rises in the past. There is no reason why Carney will overturn this approach and say similar shocks are part of the central inflation story. He also stressed that the public is more relaxed about the prospects for inflation. The latest Bank of England survey showed expectations falling steeply, albeit from a relatively high level. Still, if shoppers think inflation is falling back, it knocks out a knock-out, so to speak. There is the issue of regulation and the potential for another crash. It is one of the three knock-outs, but the likelihood is that the financial policy committee (FPC) will find intervention is unnecessary for at least the next three years. This leaves mortgage payers inside the penthouse suite of domestic bliss. They can enjoy home life safe in the knowledge that the economy is so messed up that base rates will stay at 0.5% until 2016 at least. Policymakers, unmoved by the ups and downs of monthly economic data, will dismiss the froth generated by a temporary spurt in activity as just that, froth. And if productivity improves and wages rise, well, that's all good because a rise in real wages means most people will be able to afford to pay a bit more each month to cope with higher borrowing costs. The problem for Carney is that many who followed his testimony drew a different conclusion. Some even think he is tricking the British people into thinking they can spend with cheap money. Others think the MPC is riven with splits and Carney will be out-voted by his colleagues in a year or two at the outside and bumped into raising rates. Ross Walker, UK economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: \"The most interesting development over the past week was the indication of rising hawkish dissent over the implicit signal that bank rate is on hold until late 2016.\" Walker believes that chief inflation hawk Martin Weale has friends on the committee. Bank of England chief economist Spencer Dale and Ben Broadbent, formerly of investment bank Goldman Sachs, have voiced concerns about forward guidance. Ian McCafferty, who recently joined from the business lobby group the CBI, where he was chief economic adviser, also appears to worry about inflation more than unemployment. Weale has emerged as the chief refusenik. He wanted stricter knock-outs as the price of his support for forward guidance. It seems from the evidence so far that Carney eventually persuaded him to compromise. There are plenty of analysts who believe that Weale may have lost the initial battle, but with supporters on the MPC he could win the war. Why do they want higher interest rates? Their concern is valid, if misplaced. Keeping interest rates low distorts decisions people make about long-term investments. In particular, there is the British love of property. What is better than an interest rate rise to cork the frenzy of home buying, they say. And if we want a return to growth based on productivity gains and not just higher debt, we need to get back to more normal base rates of 4%. The trouble is that thousands of households and businesses rely on low base rates to keep their heads above water. Only higher wages can cure the problem and they don't look like making an appearance any time soon.",
