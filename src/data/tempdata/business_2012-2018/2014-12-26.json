Anyway, King foresaw the end of the glory days of the supermarket and seemingly felt no shame in then: a) handing in his notice shortly after insisting he would be leading the grocer for the long term; and b) delivering a deft hospital pass to his mate and successor, Mike Coupe, who is now tasked with dealing with the wreckage. Just as King was about to depart, his stellar run of 36 consecutive quarters of sales growth abruptly ended. So Coupe and his rivals in the big four were left running huge mid-market retailers being squeezed on the one hand by the irritating German discounters Aldi and Lidl, who had devised the unthinkable ruse of charging lower prices, and on the other by upmarket competitors such as Waitrose, whose outrageous innovations include selling tasty food. Added to that, customers now seem to prefer shopping in stores based in convenient locations. Few in the industry foresaw that customers might like this. Clarke certainly didn\u2019t. His tendency to blame Tesco\u2019s woes on those around him (his \u201cevery belittle helps\u201d strategy) finally exhausted all the easy targets \u2013 but he was still scheduled to attend a party to celebrate his 40th anniversary at the retailer when it proved time for him to become the unexpected item in the debagging area. His replacement, Dave Lewis from Unilever, had never worked in retail, although he quickly seemed to appreciate the scale of the crisis. Lewis issued three profit warnings \u2013 taking Tesco\u2019s tally for the year to five \u2013 which included a \u00a3263m accounting scandal that has attracted the attentions of the Serious Fraud Office. All of which leaves Clarke \u2013 who became Tesco\u2019s fourth boss after Sir Jack Cohen, Lord MacLaurin and Sir Terry Leahy \u2013 looking a long shot to emulate his predecessors and take an honour in the new year\u2019s list. His services in the field of German retailing, on the other hand, make him a slightly shorter price for a grand cross. Luxembourg \u201cDiscover the unexpected Luxembourg\u201d, gushes the grand duchy\u2019s tourist website \u2013 and in many ways we all did so in 2014. Still, it was not the notion that plenty of folk might visit Luxembourg on a tax-dodging expedition that was the unexpected bit. The shock this year came from how few people were actually in Luxembourg to generate the frankly heroic profit levels needed for the tax dodging ruse, following November\u2019s revelations of aggressive avoidance by PwC clients in the country, published by the Guardian and more than 20 other international news outlets. Take the UK-based City broker Icap, which operates in key financial centres across the globe. One of its most lucrative operations is in Luxembourg, where its three offices \u2013 and, er, one local employee \u2013 generated almost $250m in financing income in seven years. Anyway, the leak of 548 letters, relating to 343 companies, showing how PwC wrote to Luxembourg tax authorities to agree on how their clients structured their businesses for tax purposes, proved as awkward for Jean-Claude Juncker, the new president of the European commission and Luxembourg\u2019s former prime minister, as it was for the firms involved. Many questioned his suitability for his new post, while the tax deals offered to big companies by Luxembourg during Juncker\u2019s spell as PM are being investigated by his own organisation, as illegal state aid. Women on boards Swiss Toni, the appalling car salesman from the comedy sketch programme The Fast Show, used to love comparing everything to sex. \u201cHaving therapy is very much like making love to a beautiful woman,\u201d he would schmooze. \u201cYou get on the couch, string \u2019em along with some half-lies and evasions \u2026 and then hand over all your money.\u201d The character was deliberately a dinosaur, even when the show first aired 20 years ago, but the sketches worked then (and, perhaps, even now) because this bloke really does exist \u2013 especially in the corporate world. Take the commodity trader Glencore, based in Zug, Switzerland. Its previous chairman, Simon Murray, said in 2011 that he wasn\u2019t too keen on female directors as \u201cI know they\u2019re going to get pregnant and they\u2019re going to go off for nine months\u201d. Anyway, in 2014 the group trotted out new chairman \u201cSwiss\u201d Tony Hayward to reiterate promises to appoint a female director, and thereby cease being the dinosaur that was the final FTSE 100 company with an all-male board. In a move that astonished almost everybody, Hayward kept his word and hired Patrice Merrin, a Canadian mining veteran, as its first non-exec. Merrin\u2019s appointment prompted much coverage about every FTSE group now having a female director, and you\u2019d have been forgiven for thinking that the congratulatory mood suggested Lord Davies\u2019s target of 25% female representation on blue-chip boards by 2015 had been achieved. In fact, 23% of FTSE directors are female \u2013 but 60% of companies are still below the 25% benchmark. All of which might explain why the Davies target appears to have been softened: it has been quietly changed from \u201cby 2015\u201d to \u201cin 2015\u201d. Takeovers Foreigners have been milking the UK\u2019s great institutions for years, allowing British interests to be squeezed out. Well, that\u2019s always been the excuse \u2013 whether it be the explanation for the success of US investment banks in the City or the fact that the home nations pathologically refuse to compete seriously to win proper football trophies. We saw this argument being trotted out again in 2014 in a corporate version of the football phone-in, this time as the pharmaceuticals industry became a political issue in relation to Pfizer\u2019s planned takeover of AstraZeneca. Pfizer is American, of course, while AstraZeneca is, well, a little bit British. Cue UK politicians becoming impassioned about the nation losing a great research firm if Pfizer\u2019s evil intentions were not thwarted, which rather ignored a couple of facts: namely, that AZ\u2019s most promising technologies had largely been acquired, and that the company has a stellar research track record of inactivity and disappointment, despite press releases suggesting imminent great works for the country. Still, just as with football, the argument gained legs. Pfizer got a kicking in parliament and the media, and the deal eventually evaporated \u2013 although not because the City is a principled place that thought US asset-strippers would have wrecked British science. In the end, AZ turned the approach down on price. Banks So have City bankers been good girls and boys this year? The best they could tell Santa was that their behaviour had (probably) not deteriorated in 2014. However, the fines for previous misdemeanours still rolled in. In November, six banks were collectively fined \u00a32.6bn by UK and US regulators over their traders\u2019 attempted manipulation of foreign exchange rates. HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Swiss bank UBS and US banks JP Morgan Chase, Citibank and Bank of America all coughed up. A separate investigation is continuing into Barclays \u2013 the self-styled \u201cgo-to bank\u201d, presumably as that is where the Financial Conduct Authority goes to each time it fancies trousering a cheque. Anyway, the UK portion of the forex fines \u2013 \u00a31.1bn \u2013 flowed to the Treasury, and the chancellor, George Osborne, announced in his autumn statement that it was to be put towards improving GPs\u2019 surgeries, so we all (sort of) get to benefit. Added to that was the usual list of other raps on the knuckles \u2013 RBS paid out \u00a356m in November for its IT breakdown, Lloyds \u00a3105m for Libor and Barclays \u00a338m for putting client money at risk. Yet, somehow, all of these banks were made to look professional by the Co-op, which continued its astonishing form from 2013. It concluded 2014 by failing a Bank of England stress test, which assessed the ability of major UK lenders to withstand another financial crisis. Flotations In August, the investment giant BlackRock turned on its own. In an unusual move in which one financial institution criticised others, the group\u2019s European head of capital markets, Rob Leach, bemoaned the way investors had been stung when buying shares in a string of newly floated companies that had then failed to perform as hoped. The leak of his letter to clients was helpful in deflecting some criticism from BlackRock\u2019s poorer stock selections, but Leach did seem to have a point. Britain\u2019s pension funds are routinely invested into initial public offerings (IPOs) and \u2013 in a busy year for new listings \u2013 they were losing money. The City being the City, it certainly bought some pups this year, not least the pet shop group Pets at Home, where shares floated at 245p, but are now changing hands at 190p. There was also the financial services-cum-travel agent Saga (floated at 185p, now at 151p), the electrical products website AO World (285p to 280.8p) and the property website Zoopla (220p to 200p). And, best of all, the crowning glory was King Digital Entertainment, the British computer games outfit behind Candy Crush (and not much else), which was stuffed on to Wall Street with hilarious and predictable consequences (it floated at $22.50 and now stands at $16.12). Still, these losses did not turn out to be the entire 2014 IPO story. The fast-food business Just Eat floated at 260p and closed before Christmas at 318.5p, the discount retailer Poundland listed shares at 300p that now stand at 320p and shares in the AA started off at 250p but now stand at 352.25p. Meanwhile, there are two banking flotations that have \u2013 so far \u2013 refused to embrace their sector\u2019s love of controversy, having performed steadily: Virgin Money listed at 283p and is now 288p, while TSB floated at 260p and now stands at 274.5p.",

      "bodyText": "They started arriving at midnight. By 3am there were a couple of hundred waiting in the queue outside the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London. By 5am it was manic, with the queue to get in the centre snaking around the building, past the closed and empty restaurants and into the freezing night. \u201cI saw one woman queuing out here at 3am with her kids,\u201d said one shell-shocked Boxing Day security guard. \u201cAnd I swear to god I saw her use that pushchair as a battering ram.\u201d As the 6am opening grew closer, scuffles had broken out as people tried to push in the queue, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been fairly good tempered, but we have had to keep the peace on a few occasions.\u201d By 9am on Boxing Day, which reportedly saw the biggest discounts since the collapse of Lehman brothers in 2008, Westfield was already heaving with thousands of shoppers. Around the country queues formed outside major stores - at Harrods in central London the red carpet was rolled out and the most dedicated shoppers were rewarded with complimentary mince pies and blankets. Outside the Bullring branch of Selfridges in Birmingham, shoppers started arriving at 2.30am, with thousands outside by the time the store opened its doors. The biggest queue at Westfield Stratford could be found outside the shop beloved of normcore enthusiasts and mother-in-laws on a mission to buy socks - Next. With a separate entrance to the centre dedicated for shoppers to the store, around 20 or so security guards herded the crowds with the intensity and rigour of a military operation. One guard, megaphone in hand, shouted: \u201cPlease don\u2019t push, there is a pushchair here - watch what you are doing, have a bit of common sense or someone is going to get hurt.\u201d Sitting on the floor outside the shop, surrounded by around 10 bulging Next bags, one of the store\u2019s first customers, Taran Gazu, 26, took a break from the battle to assess her spoils. \u201cI am so tired,\u201d she said, tucking into the potatoes she and her sister had brought as a picnic, to keep them going. \u201cWe arrived at 4.30, and it only opened at 6am so we were absolutely freezing. We got in and said: \u2018Ok, we are in; where do we start?\u2019\u201d Last year they made the mistake of coming later and had to wait an hour and a half to get into the store, so this year they took no chances, setting the alarm for 3am \u2013 after starting online shopping at midnight. Asked if it was worth it, she looked puzzled. \u201cOf course! Shopping is our thing.\u201d Lin Lee, 30, sat close by, throwing away clothes hangers in order to stuff more purchases into a large suitcase. She got here at 3.30, and by 9am had spent around \u00a31,500 in Next. \u201cI like to get in early,\u201d she said, saying that she would take many of her purchases back to China. She gestured at the restive masses filing through a cordon outside the shop: \u201cLook now there is too much queue.\u201d Huge discounts on Black Friday \u2013 the American retail tradition of offering heavy one-day only discounts at the end of November to kick off the seasonal shopping frenzy \u2013 and the shift to online shopping are expected to tame the traditional Boxing Day sales. According to data firm Experian and online retailing trade association IMRG a record \u00a3636m was spent online on Christmas Day, with the number of visits made to shopping websites \u2013 an estimated 142m \u2013 up 25% on last year. Internet shoppers are expected to spend \u00a3748m on Boxing Day, a whopping \u00a3519,000 a minute while online retail sites can expect 167 million visits \u2013 up 29% on 2013. \u201cThis year has seen record-breaking online shopping rates, particularly on Black Friday, which saw an astronomical \u00a3810m in estimated spend,\u201d said Experian\u2019s Giles Longhurst. \u201cTraditionally, the Boxing Day sales have been the busiest day for retailers in the UK, but this year we expect them to come second to Black Friday.\u201d While many chains, including Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Currys PC World begin their sales online on Christmas Eve, experts say some of the best deals are likely to be found in stores as retailers make price cuts to clear stock quickly. Westfield director Myf Ryan said the centre expected to repeat the record sales of 2013, when 360,000 shoppers passed through the doors of the company\u2019s two shopping centres. \u201cBoxing Day remains a huge attraction for shoppers and we can\u2019t see that changing \u2013 despite the shopping frenzy around Black Friday, she said. UK Retailers are expected to ring up sales of nearly \u00a33bn on Boxing Day, with many offering huge discounts to shift stock left in shops because of the unusually mild weather. Shoppers waiting to get into shops for the sales in the country may have rued a change in the weather, as they waited in freezing temperatures. Still, waiting longer could be more painful still \u2013 as the Met Office issued a severe cold weather warning, starting at 11am on Friday and running through to 6am on Saturday, with up to four inches of snow expected in high areas by the afternoon. There was little evidence that the shift to online shopping or the weather had resulted in a lull in the Boxing Day bonanza in east London. Collal Dawkins, 17, arrived at 4am with his pals because they thought the best bargains would be found in store, not online. \u201cOnline is congested, online is sold out, online lies,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know how many pairs of Jordans I tried to buy on Christmas Day, only to be told they had sold out. I don\u2019t trust online.\u201d Not that he was delighted with his purchases so far. \u201cWe expected mad sales, like 80% off \u2013 but we didn\u2019t read that small print \u2018on selected items\u2019.\u201d Jostling for space in the vast Primark store in Westfield, Adama Sesay, 21, was trying to motivate her friend, who was flicking half-heartedly through racks of trousers. The students from Holland were taking advantage of the big discounts on offer she said, but admitted to losing her focus. \u201cI came for trousers, and I\u2019ve got a jacket, tops and some trainers \u2013 but no trousers. But we are enjoying ourselves.\u201d At the other end of the scale in Hugo Boss, Brazilian tattoo artist Bruno Wayhs was trying on luxury coats, some with a discount of nearly \u00a3300. This was his first experience of the very British tradition, but it hadn\u2019t been too painful so far. \u201cI normally spend Boxing Day with my family and to be honest I thought the sales would be worse. I have already bought a few things, but I decided to buy a few items that were very expensive and save a lot.\u201d He had not, as yet, queued to get into any shops. \u201cI am lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like Next.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Retail experts are predicting the biggest Boxing Day discounts since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, after the mild autumn weather left fashion chains with piles of unsold winter clothing to clear after Christmas. The millions of shoppers expected to make the annual pilgrimage to the sales at shopping centres around the country are expected to be rewarded with bargains galore as stores such as House of Fraser, Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis slash prices to clear stock before the new season\u2019s ranges arrive in January. Retailers are expected to ring up sales of nearly \u00a33bn as the focus shifts from buying presents to spending gift cards and cash they in turn have received. Although many retailers were offering substantial discounts in the weeks leading up to Christmas, Jason Gordon, consumer business partner at Deloitte, thinks the scale of the discounting will mirror 2008 when the collapse of the US investment bank had a dramatic knock-on effect on consumer confidence, forcing retailers to slash prices to clear stock bought before what was expected to be a more buoyant trading period. \u201cThis a very challenging period for apparel retailers,\u201d explained Gordon. \u201cIn clothing most retailers have not got on top of their stock given the unseasonally warm weather.\u201d Deloitte monitors the pricing of more than 50 retailers and Gordon thinks discounting before Christmas was greater and far more widespread than in 2013. \u201cThis is the fourth year in a row we\u2019ve seen this [pre-Christmas] trend,\u201d he said, adding that given retailers\u2019 full stock-rooms the sales would be worth getting out of bed for. \u201cIf merchandise needs clearing, it needs clearing,\u201d he said. \u201cSome bold decisions will have been made by retailers on the level of markdown rather than have reduced stock hanging around in stores into February.\u201d The convenience of online shopping means the web cast an even bigger shadow over the high street this Christmas than in previous years. Retailers were caught off-guard by demand for bargains on Black Friday \u2013 when analysts at IMRG and Experian estimate \u00a3810m was spent on retailers\u2019 websites \u2013 and for in-store collection services, which struggled to cope with the deluge of web orders. The mega sales day at the end of November sucked sales out of the traditional trading period, compounding the trend of fewer shoppers visiting high street stores, and making its difficult for retailers to gauge the success of their Christmas campaigns. \u201cThere is no doubt that Black Friday-related pre-Christmas discounting and Click &amp; Collect have impacted trading for physical retailers,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, retail insights director at Springboard, which tracks shopper numbers. \u201cHowever, this has been combined with a general downward trend that we are seeing as a result of shoppers turning to the convenience and speed of online over high streets and shopping centres.\u201d Many chains, including Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Currys PC World started their sales online on Christmas Eve, but experts say some of the best deals are to be found in stores as retailers make aggressive price cuts to clear stock quickly and efficiently. Boxing Day is still the most important trading day of the year for big-ticket household goods retailers, with Argos, kitchen specialist Magnet and Furniture Village all launching winter sales. \u201cBoxing Day remains a huge attraction for shoppers and we can\u2019t see that changing,\u201d said Westfield director Myf Ryan of its two London malls, which attracted 360,000 visitors last year. \u201cLast year we had queues out of the door on Boxing Day by 5am and retailers like Next and Zara experienced record sales. This year we expect an exceptionally busy day yet again.\u201d Steven Madeley, who runs St David\u2019s shopping centre in Cardiff, said it was expecting about 200,000 Boxing Day bargain hunters and predicted they would spend more than \u00a33m: \u201cWe\u2019ll see similar numbers to Black Friday, but customers will have gift cards and cash gifts to spend on themselves, rather than buying for others.\u201d Upmarket London department stores Selfridges and Harrods have also pulled out the stops to lure shoppers to the West End of London. Harrods rolled out the red carpet for early shoppers this morning and laid on a string quartet as well as complimentary mince pies and blankets until the doors open at 10am. The store is promising huge discounts for designer label fans who can\u2019t stretch to full price, including a Missoni dress, half price at \u00a3499 and a Donna Karan leather jacket reduced from \u00a32,475 to \u00a31,200. But the internet shop window means stores never really close at Christmas anymore with Britons expected to have slipped away from their families to spend \u00a3636m online yesterday (XMAS DAY) - a figure that is expected to rise to nearly \u00a3750m today. \u201cOver recent years Boxing Day has typically been the busiest online shopping day of the year as consumers log on in search of a bargain from the comfort of their sofas,\u201d says Tina Spooner, IMRG\u2019s chief information officer. \u201cAlthough we expect Boxing Day to be even bigger than last year, with online spend up around 40% year-on-year, it is unlikely to eclipse the unprecedented level of sales on Black Friday.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Retail experts are predicting the biggest Boxing Day discounts since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, after the mild autumn weather left fashion chains with piles of unsold winter clothing to clear after Christmas.</p> <p>The millions of shoppers expected to make the annual pilgrimage to the sales at shopping centres around the country are expected to be rewarded with bargains galore as stores such as House of Fraser, Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis slash prices to clear stock before the new season\u2019s ranges arrive in January.</p> <p>Retailers are expected to ring up sales of nearly \u00a33bn as the focus shifts from buying presents to spending gift cards and cash they in turn have received.</p> <p>Although many retailers were offering substantial discounts in the weeks leading up to Christmas, Jason Gordon, consumer business partner at Deloitte, thinks the scale of the discounting will mirror 2008 when the collapse of the US investment bank had a dramatic knock-on effect on consumer confidence, forcing retailers to slash prices to clear stock bought before what was expected to be a more buoyant trading period.</p> <p>\u201cThis a very challenging period for apparel retailers,\u201d explained Gordon. \u201cIn clothing most retailers have not got on top of their stock given the unseasonally warm weather.\u201d</p> <p>Deloitte monitors the pricing of more than 50 retailers and Gordon thinks discounting before Christmas was greater and far more widespread than in 2013. \u201cThis is the fourth year in a row we\u2019ve seen this [pre-Christmas] trend,\u201d he said, adding that given retailers\u2019 full stock-rooms the sales would be worth getting out of bed for. \u201cIf merchandise needs clearing, it needs clearing,\u201d he said. \u201cSome bold decisions will have been made by retailers on the level of markdown rather than have reduced stock hanging around in stores into February.\u201d</p> <p>The convenience of online shopping means the web cast an even bigger shadow over the high street this Christmas than in previous years. Retailers were caught off-guard by demand for bargains on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/09/black-friday-retailers-lifted-christmas-spending-sales\" title=\"\">Black Friday</a> \u2013 when analysts at IMRG and Experian estimate \u00a3810m was spent on retailers\u2019 websites \u2013 and for in-store collection services, which struggled to cope with the deluge of web orders. The mega sales day at the end of November sucked sales out of the traditional trading period, compounding the trend of fewer shoppers visiting high street stores, and making its difficult for retailers to gauge the success of their Christmas campaigns.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no doubt that Black Friday-related pre-Christmas discounting and Click &amp; Collect have impacted trading for physical retailers,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, retail insights director at Springboard, which tracks shopper numbers. \u201cHowever, this has been combined with a general downward trend that we are seeing as a result of shoppers turning to the convenience and speed of online over high streets and shopping centres.\u201d</p> <p>Many chains, including Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Currys PC World started their sales online on Christmas Eve, but experts say some of the best deals are to be found in stores as retailers make aggressive price cuts to clear stock quickly and efficiently. Boxing Day is still the most important trading day of the year for big-ticket household goods retailers, with Argos, kitchen specialist Magnet and Furniture Village all launching winter sales.</p> <p>\u201cBoxing Day remains a huge attraction for shoppers and we can\u2019t see that changing,\u201d said Westfield director Myf Ryan of its two London malls, which attracted 360,000 visitors last year. \u201cLast year we had queues out of the door on Boxing Day by 5am and retailers like Next and Zara experienced record sales. This year we expect an exceptionally busy day yet again.\u201d</p> <p>Steven Madeley, who runs St David\u2019s shopping centre in Cardiff, said it was expecting about 200,000 Boxing Day bargain hunters and predicted they would spend more than \u00a33m: \u201cWe\u2019ll see similar numbers to Black Friday, but customers will have gift cards and cash gifts to spend on themselves, rather than buying for others.\u201d</p> <p>Upmarket London department stores Selfridges and Harrods have also pulled out the stops to lure shoppers to the West End of London.

The report reveals that two-thirds (64%) of working women in the UK are not allowed by their bosses to vary their starting and finishing times, while a quarter (25%) say they find it difficult to take one or two hours off work in an emergency to attend to personal matters. The report \u2013 Women and Flexible Working \u2013 is the first in a series of new studies supported by the global JP Morgan Chase New Skills at Work initiative \u2013 a three-year, $30m (\u00a319m) scheme designed to improve labour market infrastructure and develop the global skilled workforce. The European component of the programme was announced in April, with the IPPR as the lead research partner. The report uses statistics from the EU labour force survey and the European working conditions survey. It says the UK has a particular problem with a lack of part-time work in highly skilled jobs for highly qualified workers. But it also says employers\u2019 lack of flexibility in full-time jobs is excluding highly qualified mothers from full-time work, many of whom are on a \u201cmummy track\u201d \u2013 stuck in part-time jobs below their skill level. Simply expanding part-time work will not stop employers missing out on the brightest and best employees, it says. While the proportion of female workers in the UK who can determine their own hours is comparable with other European economies, half as many UK working women (19%) are able to adapt their hours compared with women working in Sweden (41%) and the Netherlands (38%). But this lack of autonomy is detrimental to both employers and employees, the report says. Women who work part-time in the UK are seven times as likely to let care duties dictate their working hours as men working part-time, the research shows. More than two-fifths (42%) of women who work part-time do so primarily to take care of children or disabled adults, compared with 6% of men. Dalia Ben-Galim, IPPR associate director, said: \u201cEmployers are missing out on top talent and highly qualified women are working in low-skilled jobs. That\u2019s a missed opportunity for both employers and employees. How work is arranged, and employees\u2019 level of autonomy over working hours, can have a big impact on how well people reconcile paid work with other commitments. \u201cFlexible working in its current reduced-hours form simply isn\u2019t flexible enough. The prevalence of rigid scheduling, especially in low-income jobs, often means that even reduced-hours work is not sufficient for meeting the more spontaneous demands of care-giving.\u201d At the same time, a third of women working part-time in the UK are not happy with the hours they work. A quarter (25%) of women working part-time want to work fewer hours, while more than one in 10 (13%) would prefer more. IPPR\u2019s modelling shows that the net fiscal gain to the Treasury of a five percentage-point increase in the proportion of mothers in full-time work in the UK could be \u00a3700m a year in extra taxes and fewer benefit payments.",

      "bodyText": "Angela Knight has admitted she will leave her job as boss of the power industry\u2019s lobby group next week with the sector\u2019s reputation still badly tarnished. She also accepted that many of the measures Ofgem has imposed in the teeth of opposition from the energy firms had turned out to be beneficial for the industry and for consumers. Knight, a former minister and later chief executive of the British Bankers Association, will hand over the Energy UK job to an interim successor, the former chief operating officer Lawrence Slade, but no new chief executive will be appointed before the general election in May. \u201cWe have certainly improved [our reputation] a bit. Not a lot. But we carry on improving a bit every year \u2013 that is our target,\u201d she said. \u201cYou lose confidence very quickly and takes a long time to get it back. You get it back by doing your job really well. You don\u2019t get it back with any razzmatazz. There is no silver bullet \u2026 If the industry was at three [out of 10 during the height of the criticism in the winter of 2013] we are now at four and rising. We have a long way [to go].\u201d Some of the big six suppliers such as British Gas have reported they are beginning to win back customers after price rises last year and accusations of profiteering triggered an ongoing investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority. But in recent months Ofgem has continued to hit big firms such as E.ON with penalties for failing to meet their licence obligations, while consumer debt and disconnections have risen over the past year. Some critics argue that Knight \u2013 whose leadership of the bankers\u2019 lobby group coincided with that industry coming under attack after the financial crisis of 2008 \u2013 has too direct a style, which has made her part of the problem rather than the solution. Knight insisted she was only doing her job \u2013 to present the case when government policy or regulatory change would harm her members or investment. But she said there had been a remarkable turnaround in internal industry thinking and many of those demands, which have led for instance to three million consumers changing their supplier this year alone, had proved helpful. \u201cThe number of big suppliers has increased and they [independent companies such as First Utility and Ovo Energy]are serious challengers now. In fact although their percentage share of customers is still relatively small, the impact that they are having is much bigger. They are close to customers, easy with customers. And that not only provides another alternative [for customers] but a wider catalytic effect on the industry. \u201cThey don\u2019t bring with them legacy systems and legacy issues, and they tend to be run by those who have a lot of experience in customer relationships.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s big four high street banks have handed out \u00a330m in share awards to their top management this year in their efforts to sidestep Brussels\u2019 cap on banker bonuses. The EU ruled at the beginning of the year that bonuses could be no bigger than a banker\u2019s salary \u2013 or double that if shareholders gave approval \u2013 but the move has prompted banks to make awards of shares alongside salaries and traditional bonuses to stop top bankers suffering pay cuts. The scale of the payouts to a dozen or so individuals at each of HSBC, Barclays and the bailed-out banks Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland is being revealed just as the banks prepare to hand out bonuses for 2014 \u2013 a year when many of them were hit by fines for misconduct. These included a record \u00a31.1bn fine on five banks from the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, for rigging foreign exchange markets. The annual bonus round could also be particularly sensitive as it comes in the runup to the general election. The biggest award of role-based pay, or allowances, to a management team was at HSBC, which had admitted in March it intended to give its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, \u00a31.7m in such share awards. The bank\u2019s disclosures to the stock market show Gulliver was among 13 individuals receiving a total of \u00a313.5m in shares during 2014. Barclays has handed \u00a38m to its top 12 bankers, including the chief executive, Antony Jenkins, who last year faced a wave of protests over pay at the bank. Jenkins justified a rise in bonuses in a year when profits had fallen by warning that pay cuts would send the bank into a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of top individuals leaving. RBS, 79% owned by the taxpayer, has handed out shares worth almost \u00a35.5m to its 10 most senior bankers \u2013 with the exception of chief executive Ross McEwan, who has not received any extra allowance this year. Lloyds Banking Group, 24% owned by the taxpayer, has given its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, about \u00a31m. Ten of its other most senior bankers received \u00a34m in total. The awards of shares are an alternative to a straightforward rise in salary but have proved to be controversial. The European Banking Authority \u2013 the EU\u2019s overarching banking regulator - has concluded the awards breach the EU cap. But the Bank of England, which is opposed to the bonus cap, has permitted the use of the allowances to avoid salary rises. It is not yet clear whether the UK\u2019s banks will have to respond to the EBA\u2019s criticism. George Osborne had been attempting to overturn the bonus cap in the European court of justice but abandoned his challenge in November. Even so, the way the most senior bankers are paid is expected to be changed further after Bank of England governor Mark Carney backed a proposal by US central banker Bill Dudley to pay bankers in performance bonds that could be clawed bank in the event of misconduct that emerged later. Carney raised the idea because the bonus cap restricts the amount of payouts that can be withheld or clawed back. The City enjoyed a record year in 2014 for fines in the City, with the total hitting \u00a31.4m after the FCA\u2019s fines for rigging foreign exchange markets. Among the five banks involved were RBS and HSBC, while Barclays faces a penalty for the same misconduct in 2015.
