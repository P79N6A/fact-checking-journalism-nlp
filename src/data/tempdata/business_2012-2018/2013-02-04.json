      "bodyText": "The chairman of Lloyds Banking Group on Monday faced criticism for the way the bailed-out bank handled mis-sold payment protection insurance and attempted to avoid liability for claims that have already topped \u00a35bn. Giving evidence to the banking standards commission, Sir Win Bischoff faced repeated questioning about why the bank had participated in a judicial review that had stalled claims until last year. \"I would suggest to you it was a cosy club at the board level of Lloyds and you didn't have a handle on it and you allowed it to get out of control,\" said Labour peer Lord McFall. He added: \"I'll put it to you it was because it was a hugely profitable product and you were damned if you were going to stop selling this product.\" Bischoff strongly rejected the criticism, insisting Lloyds went for a judicial review for \"clarity\". The bank, which has 5,000 staff devoted to dealing with PPI, was the first to withdraw from the review when the new chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, arrived 18 months ago. The bank's total provisions have already reached \u00a35.3bn \u2013 more than the first estimates for the entire industry. A critic of \"bogus\" claims by professional claims management firms, Horta-Os\u00f3rio backed calls for a time limit for customers to make claims for PPI. The latest mis-selling scandal covers interest-rate swaps and Horta-Os\u00f3rio said that the scandal had so far cost the bank \u00a390m, which could rise on 1 March when the bank publishes its results for 2012. Horta-Os\u00f3rio insisted that he had not given any thought to his bonus for 2012 \u2013 which could amount to \u00a32.5m. \"I don't want to speculate about something that, to the best of my knowledge, has not yet been discussed,\" he told the commission. It is thought that his bonuses could be linked in future to the average price at which the taxpayer bought its 40% stake in the bank, at 74p per share, and could be withheld from him for five years. The shares closed last night at 50.6p. Bischoff insisted that the bank, which unlike bailed-out rival Royal Bank of Scotland does not have a large investment banking arm, would be \"very much aware\" of public sentiment over pay. \"It will be the lowest undoubtedly of any bank,\" Bischoff said. The pair exposed differences with the industry lobby group the British Bankers' Association by refusing to support the BBA's criticism of banking reforms. The BBA had warned about the impact on lending of proposed reforms to banking regulation by George Osborne. The Chancellor has threatened bank with break up if they do not implement the ringfence properly but the BBA's chief executive Anthony Browne had said it would \"create uncertainty\" Horta-Os\u00f3rio insisted that he did not support the statement. The BBA said its members all had different opinions. Lloyds is already 90% ring fenced, the bank said.",

      "bodyText": "Premier Foods' new boss has forced out the company's chief operating officer on the first day of his new job. Geoff Eaton's departure comes less than a week after his former boss, Michael Clarke, quit suddenly, saying he wanted a job with a bigger company. Gavin Darby, the new chief executive, replaced Clarke on Monday morning, and by the afternoon it was decided the company, which owns brands including Hovis and Mr Kipling, wanted a \"flatter executive management structure\" that no longer required Eaton's services. The company said in a statement: \"It has therefore been agreed with Geoff Eaton, current chief operating officer, that he will step down from the board of directors with immediate effect and will leave the company.\" However, the Guardian understands that Eaton had offered to stay, despite being overlooked for the top job, and had no idea he was going to be axed until Monday morning. He was not at the company's Hertfordshire head office on Monday afternoon when Premier informed the stock market of his departure. A source close to the company said: \"Geoff had wanted to be chief executive, but was happy to stay to steady the ship after Michael left so suddenly. He only agreed to leave after he was told he would be surplus to requirements. Any suggestion he was unhappy at being overlooked is untrue.\" Another source confirmed that Eaton was on a longlist of candidates drawn up by headhunters to replace Clarke, but was not interviewed. He added: \"Gavin [Darby, the new chief executive] was head and shoulders above anyone else.\" Darby was the only candidate to meet David Beever, the chairman of Premier. Eaton is expected to get a payout following his departure but, because he had only been with the company for four months, it is not known how much he will receive until the company's annual report is published at the AGM scheduled for April. Before Premier, he was chief executive at the convenience store group Uniq, and he had been brought in to oversee plans to divide the company into a groceries and bread operations. The new Premier structure will \"enable commercial and functional management to report directly to the CEO\", according to the company. The latest boardroom change sent shares down 3%: they closed at 89p, following a 12% tumble last week when Clarke quit. He had stunned investors by standing down just 17 months into the job, walking away with more than \u00a32.7m because he was \"looking to be CEO of a large corporation\". He added: \"I've managed much bigger businesses in the past. I've got this business back on its feet \u2013 now it's the time to hand over. \"Now people are aware I'm open to a large opportunity,\" he said. \"I believe I have the capacity for a large CEO role in the UK or USA.\" Clarke cut more than 1,500 jobs over the past year and sold many of Premier's best-known brands, including Branston Pickle and Sarson's Vinegar, to pay off the company's debts.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a brief summary of today's events: \u2022 Europe's stock markets have suffered their worst losses in months, in the face of political uncertainty in Italy and allegations that senior politicians in Spain, including PM Mariano Rajoy, received illicit payments over many years. In London, the FTSE 100 finished 100 point lower while the Italian FTSE MIB was the worst performer, down 4.5% (details at 5.06pm and reaction at 5.26pm) Spanish 10-year bond yields finished 23 basis points higher, at 5.45%. \u2022 Rajoy denied the claims of corruption at the heart of his People's Party. On a visit to Berlin he insisted the allegations were false. Chancellor Angela Merkel offered some support, saying she still has confidence in the Spanish government (see 3.05pm onwards). \u2022 The People's Party also hit back, saying it would launch legal action against those who released the information (see 2.46pm) \u2022 In Italy, the prospect of a hung parliament loomed after SIlvio Berlusconi pledged to abolish the country's unpopular property tax if elected - an offer that Mario Monti swiftly dismissed as implausible (see 11.03am) \u2022 In Greece, farmers maintained their protests against the government, while the finance minister was sent a bullet in the post (see 4.19pm). I'll be back tomorrow to see whether the crisis continues to pick up pace. Until then, thanks and goodnight. In Madrid, five protesters continued to demonstrate at Puerta del Sol today, having set up a camp last night to express their anger over the corruption allegations leveled against the People's Party: Today's 100-point drop is the biggest fall on the FTSE 100 since last July. Here's some reaction to sharp falls on Europe's stock markets, and the drop in the value of the euro (see 5.06pm for details). Christopher Vecchio, Currency Analyst at DailyFX The Italian elections due in a few weeks are seeing a closely-contested race, with former prime minister and widely-viewed \u2018Euro-negative\u2019 candidate Silvio Berlusconi narrowing the polls. In Spain, a corruption case has rattled the government, with opposition leaders calling for PM Mariano Rajoy\u2019s resignation, an event that would essentially be the market equivalent to the Greek elections last May. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets Investors are once again being spooked by political uncertainty from both Spain and Italy as both countries deal with local political difficulties that could derail ongoing and future reform programs. While markets appear able to shrug off bad economic data, as Spain January unemployment jumps 132k, it is politics once again that has markets worried as Spanish PM Rajoy deals with a corruption scandal over illegal cash payments that could have the potential to seriously damage his government. Even in Italy the calm waters of recent weeks have hit stormy seas as the general election campaign starts to see a rise in support for Berlusconi which has increased the risks of political deadlock post-election rising here as well. John Higgins of Capital Economics Allegations of corruption against Spanish PM Rajoy and reports that former Italian PM Berlusconi is gaining ground in the country\u2019s polls ahead of this month\u2019s election took some of the shine off the euro on Monday. Notwithstanding its latest wobble, we continue to forecast an appreciation of the euro to $1.40 by mid-year as sentiment towards the euro-zone slowly improves. But we are also sticking to our forecast that that the exchange rate will slip back to $1.25 by year-end \u2013 a view which is predicated on the assumption that the crisis will flare up again in the second half of the year. That being said, Monday\u2019s news underlines the fact that such a flare-up could happen at any time. Martin Tormey, head of equity trading at Goodbody Stockbrokers. It's just a bit of profit-taking today, it's been coming for a while. We were over-bought and we have seen a few guys come and look at names that have had big moves. Europe's stock markets have closed, posting the largest daily falls of 2013. Here's the damage: FTSE 100: down 100 points at 6246, -1.58% Germany's DAX: down 195 points at 7638, -2.5% French CAC: down 113 points at 3659, -3% Spanish IBEX: down 310 points at 7919, -3.77% Italian FTSE MIB: down 779 points at 16539, - 4.5% And over on Wall Street the main indices are down around 1% In the foreign exchange markets, the euro has now fallen by over 1 cent against the US dollar to $1.352. Reaction to follow News in from Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith says the Greek finance minister Yiannis Stournaras appears to be under mounting pressure \u2013 and, it would seem, threats. Helena write: Facing striking workers and mounting protests from both the public and private sector over austerity measures, Greece\u2019s beleaguered finance minister Yiannis Stournaras has, we now learn, been the recipient of a single bullet \u2013 delivered in an envelope intercepted by his staff. The well-informed daily, Ta Nea, citing unnamed sources, says the technocrat, an economics professor by profession, was sent the envelope containing the bullet from Crete. Its sender had gone by the name of \u201cCretan revolution.\u201d A similar envelope, also containing a single bullet, arrived at the offices of the main tax office in Chania, also in Crete, on February 1st. \u201cThe envelope never reached the hands of the minister as it was intercepted by his secretary,\u201d the newspaper reported. The anti-terror squad is now investigating the matter. Stournaras, who was selected to the post in June shortly after Greece\u2019s conservative-led coalition assumed power, has also come under heavy fire from leading right-wingers in the government angry over his pointed criticism of past conservative governments to rein in Greece\u2019s staggering debts. Today\u2019s revelations emerged within hours of the Greek finance minister announcing that, for the first time Greece had met its fiscal targets in 2012, securing a primary cash surplus of 434 million euros, compared to a deficit of 3.5 billion euros in 2011. Meanwhile, Helena say, protests by farmers and striking seamen who have kept boats docked in ports for the past 48 hours, have put the government on the defensive. Senior aides to prime minister Antonis Samaras have insisted they do not want to resort to forcibly mobilizing the strikers back to work following the uproar over a similar move to end a nine-day strike by metro workers recently. Both sectors are demanding that the coalition roll back tax increases, wage cuts and other austerity measures demanded in return for emergency bailout funds from the EU and IMF. Robin Bew, chief economist &amp; editorial director at the Economist Group, reckons Mariano Rajoy won't be dislodged by the secret payments scandal: The selloff continues -- the FTSE 100 is now down 102 points, at 6249. Meanwhile, Italian banking shares are being pummeled as traders get nervous at the sight of a resurgent Silvio Berlusconi, and the prospect of a hung parliament (see 11.03am): From the Milan stock market, @lemasabachthani has the details: (MPS is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, whose own scandal could escalate this week) Angela Merkel's expression of support for Mariano Rajoy isn't too surprising \u2013 anything else would have caused more upheaval and alarm in the eurozone, after all. The BBC's Gavin Hewitt describes her vote of confidence as 'guarded': And here's the key quote from Angela Merkel, when asked whether the Spanish corruption scandal had damaged confidence in Mariano Rajoy: We have a relation of full trust in the Spanish government... I have the impression that the whole Spanish government is working to drive down unemployment, to push through structural reforms. (with thanks to Reuters' Berlin bureau) The key line from this press conference (see 3.05pm onwards) is that Angela Merkel says she has confidence in the Spanish government, and in Mariano Rajoy's economic reforms. Here's some reaction: And a few other talking points: As expected, the first question from the press pack in Berlin was related to the corruption allegations that have struck Mariano Rajoy and his People's Party: The Spanish PM was unbowed, saying that his government remains strong and will overcome the accusations made against it. Rajoy also confirmed that PP are considering legal action against those who leaked the data, which appeared to show payments to senior officials. The Angela Merkel-Mariano Rajoy press conference has kicked off in Berlin. The German chancellor spoke first, saying the two leaders had agreed they must show \"solidarity\" as fellow members of the eurozone, while also continuing with fiscal consolidation. She pledged to co-operate with Rajoy to improve youth employment in Spain, where 60% of young people are out of work. Rajoy then spoke, running through all the reforms that his government are making. He also pledged to announce new measures to stimulate growth later this month. (ps there's also a Spanish TV feed here) We have confirmation that Spain's People's party is planning legal action over the allegations that senior party members, including PM Mariano Rajoy, have been receiving secret payments: From Madrid, Martin Roberts reports: Spain\u2019s governing People\u2019s Party (PP) has just said it will take legal action against whoever has leaked documents published last Thursday that purported to show Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy receiving \u20ac250,000 that had been hidden from tax authorities. \"All those who may have attributed, leaked and published,\u201d the documents -- allegedly drawn up by two former PP treasurers -- may be subject to the action, third-ranking PP member Carlos Floriano told a news conference called before Rajoy is due to speak to the media alongside Angela Merkel after a summit in Berlin. Rajoy denied the allegations in a televised speech on Saturday, but did not take questions. On Sunday, opposition Socialist leader Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba called for Rajoy to resign, which the premier has ruled out. Also on Sunday, opinion polls showed the PP\u2019s popularity had tumbled from when they won power in November 2011 to within a whisker of the Socialists, although neither party would be able to command anything like a majority. Fed up with record unemployment, an economic crisis with no signs of ending after five years and now fresh reports of corruption almost daily, Spanish voters have increasingly turned to small parties or the streets. Police helicopters buzzed central Madrid rooftops for three nights in a row after Thursday\u2019s allegations as protestors rallied outside PP headquarters. See 8.40am for photos of yesterday's protests. Mariano Rajoy and Angela Merkel are due to hold a press conference in Berlin in a few minutes - it should be streamed here. Europe's stock markets are in full-blown retreat now, as the Spanish corruption scandal (see 8.06am) and the prospect of a hung parliament in Italy alarms traders. The Spanish and Italian markets are suffering the most, with the other major markets also falling back. Not a reason to panic \u2013 some 'correction' was inevitable given the recent gains. But certainly a sign of jitters (when seen alongside with the jump in Spanish and Italian bond yields today). FTSE 100: down 72 points at 6274, - 1.1% Italian FTSE MIB: down 482 points at 16836, - 2.8% Spanish IBEX: down 181 points at 8047, - 2.2% German DAX: down 120 points at 7712, - 1.5% French CAC: down 58 points at 3715, -1.5% It rather appears that traders got carried away with the optimism last month, when the FTSE 100 jumped 6.4% in its best January since 1989. As Nick Xanders, who heads European equity strategy at BTIG, put it to Reuters: There are a lot of risks out there and, given where the market is, I don't think a lot of it is priced into the market. So I am definitely more on the cautious side. And Gemma Godfrey, head of investment strategy at Brooks Macdonald agrees: Dow Jones Newswires is reporting that Spain's Popular Party has begun legal action over the corruption allegations made against the party: More as we get it.... Under fire at home, and now under an umbrella -- Mariano Rajoy has landed in Germany for talks with chancellor Angela Merkel. The two leaders exchanged a friendly greeting, before inspecting a military honour guard in a rainy Berlin. We're expecting a press conference at 2.45pm GMT, or 3.45pm local time (but this may change...) This is rather neat -- Reuters have pulled together charts of the indicators which ECB president Mario Draghi uses to monitor the eurozone economy: Online here, it tracks sovereign borrowing costs, the cost of insuring those bonds,stock market volatility, bank deposit levels, claims and liabilities in the Target 2 payment system, and that size of the ECB's own balance sheet: The sell-off of Spain's sovereign debt continues this morning. The yield (or interest rate) on its 10-year bonds has now hit 5.43% - up 20 basis points today. That's the highest level seen in the markets since mid-December, suggesting the Spanish corruption allegations are hitting market confidence. Sony Kapoor of the ReDefine think tank comments: In Italy - the eurozone's other hotbed of political uncertainty - the gloves are off and the bond yields are up. The prospect of a hung parliament, and a move away from the reforms implemented by Mario Monti's government, pushed Italian 10-year bonds up by 10 basis points this morning to 4.42%. This follows Silvio Berlusconi's pledge yesterday to abolish Italy's unpopular property tax, and even refund the money paid since prime minister Monti introduced it in 2011. Terribly generous of him, eh? My colleague LIzzy Davies reported from Rome last night: In a speech aimed at winning over the large number of undecided voters, the billionaire media mogul cast himself once again as a friend of the people who would break with the agenda of the technocrat prime minister, Mario Monti. The centrepiece of a series of measures announced in Milan was a promise not only to abolish the loathed property tax but also to refund payments made in 2012 \u2013 costing the treasury an estimated \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.5bn). Monti was swift to dismiss Berlusconi's speech, saying the former PM \"has never kept any of his promises\". Still, the offer of a tax cut will probably win Berlusconi's party more votes than it costs him, which could make the election (on 24-25 February) even tighter. As Rabobank's Jane Foley commented: There has been a rise in speculation that the Italian election scheduled for the end of this month could bring a hung parliament. This would threaten the progress of further budgetary reform. Interesting times.... Grim economic data from Ireland \u2013 the number of new houses built in the Republic hit a record low in 2012. From Dublin, Henry McDonald reports: The Irish Construction Industry Federation has revealed that fewer than 8,500 new homes were built last year, which is 14,000 less than the previous low, since records began in 1970. And there seems little hope of an upturn in the industy that suffered most from the Celtic Tiger crash with the Federation warning that there may even be few houses built in 2013. Banks and their reluctance to lend to first time buyers are being singled out as one of main reasons why the slump in house building appears to be going from bad to worse. The CIF says that banks - including those rescused with billions of Irish and European taxpayers money - should keep their promise to provide more credit to potential house buyers. CIF direct Hubert Fitzpatrick told RTE's Morning Ireland programme today that according to a recent report by Economic and Social Research Institute Ireland neeeds to build between 15,000 to 20,000 to meet the demands of the country's growing population. Europe's main share indices this morning, led by Italy as the general election approaches (of which more shortly) FTSE 100: down 18 points at 6328, - 0.29% Spanish IBEX: down 29 points at 8200, -0.4% Italian FTSE MIB: down 230 points at 17091, -1.3% German DAX: down 7 points at 7827, - 0.1% French CAC: down 5 points at 3768, - 0.13% After rising strongly in January, traders are becoming edgier as political tensions rise in the eurozone again. Matt Basi, a senior sales trader at CMC Markets, says: After impressive recent gains European equities cooled in early trade this morning as political uncertainty in Italy and Spain put a bid under peripheral Eurozone treasury yields. After the euphoria of Friday\u2019s breach of 14,000 in the Dow, sighs of resignation abound on trading desks around the city as investors are once again forced to contemplate the uneven political landscape. The latest unemployment data confirms the Spanish economy continued to decline at the start of 2013. The jobless total rose by 132,000 people, or 2.7% in January, according to the country's labour ministry, pushing the total officially out of work to 4.98 million, a new record. That figure does not include the approximately 1 million not officially registered as out of work. This graph from El Mundo shows how the jobless total has risen steadily since the end of the summer holiday season, when many temporary contracts end. In the currency markets, the euro has dropped almost half a cent against the US dollar to $1.3597. That follows a warning from the French finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, that the single currency has become too strong. Mariano Rajoy is to meet the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in Berlin today. Officially the pair will discuss measures to stimulate growth in the eurozone, but journalists will be keen to raise the corruption scandal in a press conference this afternoon. Public anger over corruption allegations in Spain spilled on to the streets of Madrid last night, with protesters calling for the Spanish prime minister to step down. Here's a selection of photos from the scene: A small number of demonstrators formed a protest camp in Puerta del Sol Square: Spain's borrowing costs are rising in early trading, as the City reacts to the weekend's developments. The yield (or interest rate) on Spanish 10-year bonds has risen to 5.34%, from 5.21% on Friday. That suggests traders are warier of Spanish debt, as they watch the political crisis in Madrid. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest developments across the eurozone, and in the wider world economy. The political crisis in Spain is deepening following allegations that a number of senior officials in the ruling People's Party received secret payments from a so-called slush fund. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy now faces calls to resign, following claims that he and other senor officials had received secret payments over almost two decades. Rajoy, who is accused of receiving around \u20ac25k of kickbacks a year, insisted on Saturday that his party was innocent. He pledged: I have never received nor distributed undeclared money. But the denial did not ease the pressures created by the allegations - made by El Pais last week. Last night, opposition leader Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba called for Rajoy's resignation, telling reporters: Rajoy should give up his role as the head of government. He cannot tackle the very difficult situation confronting Spain. Rajoy clearly hopes to ride out the scandal. He has promised to publish full details of his income and assets in an effort to calm the storm. But his position is shakier than a week ago. Public anger over the allegations is exacerbated by the deepening Spanish recession and record jobless levels \u2013 at a time when the PM is pushing through an unpopular \u20ac60bn austerity package. Just when the financial markets were relaxed about Spain, and its ability to keep funding itself, up pops a political crisis.... I'll be tracking the latest developments in Spain, and beyond, though the day...",

The well-informed daily, Ta Nea, citing unnamed sources, says the technocrat, an economics professor by profession, was sent the envelope containing the bullet from Crete. Its sender had gone by the name of \u201cCretan revolution.\u201d </p> <p>A similar envelope, also containing a single bullet, arrived at the offices of the main tax office in Chania, also in Crete, on February 1st. \u201cThe envelope never reached the hands of the minister as it was intercepted by his secretary,\u201d the newspaper reported. The anti-terror squad is now investigating the matter. Stournaras, who was selected to the post in June shortly after Greece\u2019s conservative-led coalition assumed power, has also come under heavy fire from leading right-wingers in the government angry over his pointed criticism of past conservative governments to rein in Greece\u2019s staggering debts.</p> <p>Today\u2019s revelations emerged within hours of the Greek finance minister announcing that, for the first time Greece had met its fiscal targets in 2012, securing a primary cash surplus of 434 million euros, compared to a deficit of 3.5 billion euros in 2011.</p> </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, Helena say, protests by farmers and striking seamen who have kept boats docked in ports for the past 48 hours, have put the government on the defensive.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Senior aides to prime minister Antonis Samaras have insisted they do not want to resort to forcibly mobilizing the strikers back to work following the uproar over a similar move to end a nine-day strike by metro workers recently.

    "webTitle": "RBS bankers must pay Libor fine, says George Osborne", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne is forcing Royal Bank of Scotland to cut its bankers' pay to ensure that taxpayers are not left to pick up the cost of the upcoming multimillion-pound fine for Libor rigging. The chancellor said his views had been made clear to the management of the bailed-out bank in an attempt to defuse public anger about the portion of the fine \u2013 which could amount to between \u00a3400m to \u00a3500m in total \u2013 that will be paid to the US authorities. \"When it comes to RBS, I am clear that the bill for any US fine related to this investigation should on this occasion be paid for by the bankers, and not the taxpayer,\" Osborne said. Speaking in Bournemouth where he unveiled plans to reform the banking system, Osborne appeared to back the RBS chief executive, Stephen Hester, but indicated he expects heads to roll as a result of the fine for rigging Libor \u2013 a key interest rate. It was \"well known\" that RBS was considering management changes, Osborne said. The fine from the UK's Financial Services Authority is thought to be just under \u00a390m with US regulators levying fines of around four times that amount. In the furore that followed the \u00a3290m Libor fine paid by Barclays last year, \u00a359.5m of which was levied by the FSA, the law was changed to ensure that fines went to the government. \"Those who were doing the supervising must also bear their share of the responsibility,\" Osborne said. \"The RBS board and the RBS senior management are well aware of that and decisions are in hand.\" He added that Hester is \"taking the action to ensure those responsible are held to account\". It is expected that the departure of John Hourican, the head of the investment bank, will be announced once the Libor fine is revealed, possibly later this week, although he is not thought to be personally implicated in the rigging of Libor. The size of the bonus pool for 2012 at RBS has yet to be disclosed. It was \u00a3390m for 2011 and is expected to fall by as much as \u00a3150m. But the call by the chancellor to ensure bankers pay for the Libor fine does not preclude bonuses being paid for 2012. Responding to questions about why senior bankers should receive bonuses after a year of scandal, Osborne acknowledged that Hester and Barclays boss Antony Jenkins have waived their bonuses. He said there could have been \"enormous public anger\" if fines levied on RBS by US regulators were paid by the taxpayer, not the bankers. \"That is not on,\" said Osborne, who has told the bank's management that a fine imposed by international regulators should be paid out of bankers' pay. If the fine is paid by shareholders, led by taxpayers who own 83%of the bank, \"that could have been a very great source of public anger this spring,\" said Osborne. The chancellor confirmed remarks by Treasury sources over the weekend which had suggested he was concerned about how the Libor fine would be paid. In his speech, Osborne insisted that \"everyone should exercise restraint and responsibility\" over bonuses. Osborne was accused of \"rhetoric\" and a \"partial climbdown\" by Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, after he said he would use legislation to threaten banks with being broken up if they attempted to flout rules requiring them to ringfence their high street and investment banking operations. Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP whose banking standards commission helped create the idea of \"electrifying\" the ringfence, said the chancellor had taken an \"important step in the right direction\". The ringfence was a key plank in proposals by Sir John Vickers' independent commission but the banking standards commission had been concerned banks would try to \"game\" the ringfence. \"They will always try to do so unless strong disincentives are put in place,\" said Tyrie. Treasury minister Greg Clark was forced to address MPs after an urgent question on banks tabled by Labour following Osborne's speech. The shadow Treasury minister, Chris Leslie, said Osborne had \"fudged the tough stance\" recommended by Vickers.",

It was \"well known\" that RBS was considering management changes, Osborne said.</p> <p>The fine from the UK's Financial Services Authority is thought to be just under \u00a390m with US regulators levying fines of around four times that amount. In the furore that followed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\">the \u00a3290m Libor fine paid by Barclays last year</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk/library/communication/pr/2012/070.shtml\" title=\"\">\u00a359.5m of which was levied by the FSA</a>, the law was changed to ensure that fines went to the government.</p> <p>\"Those who were doing the supervising must also bear their share of the responsibility,\" Osborne said. \"The RBS board and the RBS senior management are well aware of that and decisions are in hand.\"</p> <p>He added that Hester is \"taking the action to ensure those responsible are held to account\".</p> <p>It is expected that the departure of John Hourican, the head of the investment bank, will be announced once the Libor fine is revealed, possibly later this week, although he is not thought to be personally implicated in the rigging of Libor. The size of the bonus pool for 2012 at RBS has yet to be disclosed. It was \u00a3390m for 2011 and is expected to fall by as much as \u00a3150m. But the call by the chancellor to ensure bankers pay for the Libor fine does not preclude bonuses being paid for 2012.</p> <p>Responding to questions about why senior bankers should receive bonuses after a year of scandal, Osborne acknowledged that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jun/29/rbs-stephen-hester-bonus-computer\" title=\"\">Hester</a> and Barclays boss <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/01/barclays-qatar-serious-fraud-office-fsa\" title=\"\">Antony Jenkins</a> have waived their bonuses.</p> <p>He said there could have been \"enormous public anger\" if fines levied on RBS by US regulators were paid by the taxpayer, not the bankers.</p> <p>\"That is not on,\" said Osborne, who has told the bank's management that a fine imposed by international regulators should be paid out of bankers' pay. If the fine is paid by shareholders, led by taxpayers who own 83%of the bank, \"that could have been a very great source of public anger this spring,\" said Osborne.</p> <p>The chancellor <a href=\"ttp://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/feb/02/rbs-bankers-taxpayers-libor-fine-chancellor\" title=\"\">confirmed remarks by Treasury sources</a> over the weekend which had suggested he was concerned about how the Libor fine would be paid. In his speech, Osborne insisted that \"everyone should exercise restraint and responsibility\" over bonuses.</p> <p>Osborne was accused of \"rhetoric\" and a \"partial climbdown\" by Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, after he said he would use legislation to threaten banks with being broken up if they attempted to flout rules requiring them to ringfence their high street and investment banking operations.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP whose banking standards commission helped create the idea of \"electrifying\" the ringfence, said the chancellor had taken an \"important step in the right direction\". The ringfence was a key plank in proposals by Sir John Vickers' independent commission but the banking standards commission had been concerned banks would try to \"game\" the ringfence. \"They will always try to do so unless strong disincentives are put in place,\" said Tyrie.</p> <p>Treasury minister Greg Clark was forced to address MPs after an urgent question on banks tabled by Labour following Osborne's speech. The shadow Treasury minister, Chris Leslie, said Osborne had \"fudged the tough stance\" recommended by Vickers.</p>",

Aggreko, which provided power for event for the 23rd time, was responsible for the CBS Compound as well as the international broadcast and a large part of the halftime show, all of which operated flawlessly and with no reported outages throughout the event.",

The reading \u2013 which remains below the 50 mark that indicates no change in output \u2013 fell short of economists' forecasts of 49.1. Construction accounts for less than 7% of Britain's gross domestic product, but weakness in the sector was the main drag on the economy last year and helped tip the country back into recession. UK GDP declined again in the final three months of 2012 and another quarter of contraction at the beginning of this year would push the economy into an unprecedented triple-dip recession. But an upbeat business confidence survey out on Monday suggested Britain should avoid that, with optimism rising even within the construction sector. The PMI also noted that building companies were more optimistic about the outlook for business activity over the next 12 months, although confidence remained weak compared with long-term norms. Construction output in January fell for the third month running.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Bank bosses face a grilling from parliamentarians on the banking standards commission this week as the industry braces for another reputational hit from the Libor-rigging scandal and amid further management upheaval at Barclays. Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, chief executive of bailed-out Lloyds Banking Group, is expected to be questioned on Monday about whether he should pocket a potential \u00a32.5m bonus after Friday's news that Barclays boss Antony Jenkins has waived his mooted \u00a31m bonus. Barclays announced management changes on Sunday with finance director Chris Lucas and general counsel Mark Harding preparing to retire \u2013 the fifth set of management changes at the top of the bank since the \u00a3290m Libor fine that led to Jenkins' promotion and the resignation of his predecessor Bob Diamond. Stephen Hester, the chief executive of 83%-state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland, had already declined his potential payment for 2012 following an IT crisis and as the bank prepares to pay out up to \u00a3500m to settle allegations of manipulating Libor. Lloyds is yet to reveal what bonus Horta-Os\u00f3rio \u2013 who presided over a 77% rise in Lloyds' share price in 2012 and declined a bonus in 2011 \u2013 will receive in addition to his \u00a31.1m salary. The bank insists no decision on the topic has been made. However, the subject is likely to be pounced on by the banking standards commission, with a member of the panel telling the Guardian that the bonuses of Horta-Os\u00f3rio, as well as HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver, would be a \"natural thing to come up\". Another source close to the inquiry added: \"It is likely that remuneration will be raised at one, if not all of, [this week's] sessions.\" Unlike Lloyds, HSBC did not require a taxpayer bailout during the financial crisis. However, last year it was forced to pay a \u00a31.2bn fine to US regulators to settle allegations that it had allowed itself to be used to launder billions of dollars for drug barons and potential terrorists for nearly a decade until 2010. Gulliver was awarded a \u00a32.1m bonus on top of his \u00a31.25m salary in 2011 \u2013 his first year as HSBC's chief executive \u2013 a pay packet that was swollen to \u00a37.2m by the bank's long-term incentive scheme. He and his counterparts from Lloyds and Barclays will appear before the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which was established last summer in the wake of the Libor-rigging scandal. The inability of the banking sector to avoid a series of scandals has ensured that the issue of banker bonuses has remained toxic. When the banking standards commission took evidence from the chairman of Barclays' remuneration committee, Sir John Sunderland, last week the members described his defence of the generous bonuses awarded to Diamond as \"unrepentant\" and \"absolutely extraordinary\". Last week the chancellor George Osborne indicated to RBS that its bankers must give up their bonuses to pay international fines imposed for the Libor-rigging scandal and on Monday he will unveil measures intended to cushion high street banks from any wrongdoing in their investment banking businesses. But the chancellor is not intending to reinstate a crucial part of the Vickers reforms that would restrict the so-called leverage cap to 4%, enabling a bank to lend 25 times more than its capital. He has watered that down to a 3% cap \u2013 which would allow banks to lend out 33 times. Even so, the chancellor wants to portray 2013 as the \"year we reset our banking system\" and intends to tell an audience in Bournemouth that he will have a reserve power to break-up banks if they fail to implement the ringfence between their high street banking arms and investment banking businesses in line with the Vickers reforms. This so-called \"electrification\" of the ringfence was suggested during pre-legislative scrutiny by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, chaired by Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie. Lord Oakeshott, a former Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats in the Lords, said the scandals at Barclays showed the ringfence should be \"sky high with 10,000 volts\" running through it. But bankers immediately warned this would have an impact on lending. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, said: \"This will create uncertainty for investors, making it more difficult for banks to raise capital, which will ultimately mean that banks will have less money to lend to businesses.\" The chancellor will blame Labour's previous system of regulation, which he is tearing up, for the crisis, saying: \"The fire alarm was ringing but no-one was listening. And when the crisis hit, the fire was then so great that the whole economy was sacrificed to put it out \u2026 The British people need to know that lessons have been learned. And they have.\" Antony Jenkins, Barclays \u00a31m Size of bonus waived. \u00a32.7m Size of bonus awarded to Bob Diamond, Jenkins' predecessor, for 2011. \u00a3290m Size of the fine imposed on Barclays to settle Libor-rigging allegations.

Osborne will publish legislation to ringfence high street banking operations from so-called \"casino\" investment banking arms and go one step further by handing regulators symbolically important powers to punish those banks which fail to erect the division correctly. \"My message to the banks is clear: if a bank flouts the rules, the regulator and the Treasury will have the power to break it up altogether - full separation, not just ring fence,\" Osborne is expected to say. In his speech in Bournemouth, Osborne will not bash banks, instead blame Labour for the regulatory system that led to the bank bailout and outline changes he is making to break up the Financial Services Authority and hand more powers to the Bank of England. \"Any bunch of politicians can bash the banks, chase the headlines, court the populist streak. But what good would that do our country? The jobs, the investment, the banking system we all need would go with it. Let's take the anger we feel about the banks and turn it into change to build the banking system that works for us all,\" said Osborne. The announcement by Barclays that Chris Lucas, its finance director since 2007, is planning to retire, came alongside an announcement that general counsel Mark Harding is also preparing to leave after 10 years. Their departures are the latest management upheaval at the bank which has also lost its chief executive, Bob Diamond, chairman Mark Agius and chief operating officer Jerry del Missier in the wake of the Libor scandal. Lucas has health problems which have had a bearing on his decision to retire but have not affected his ability to do his job. He also faces an investigation by the City regulator about disclosures the bank made during a 2008 fundraising that prevented Barclays taking a taxpayer bailout. He will stay on until his successor is found. The bank insists that the disclosures it made when it raised the crucial lifeline from investors, including from the Gulf state of Qatar, were adequate. Lucas is one of four current and former Barclays bankers' being investigated. With RBS facing a multi-million pound fine for Libor rigging, Osborne has called on the bailed out bank to use its bonus pool to pay the penalty, the majority of which will go the US regulators. Labour's shadow Treasury minister accused the chancellor of \"rhetoric\".",
