      "bodyText": "David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Nick Clegg all admitted that they have made cash-in-hand payments to tradesmen as Downing Street struggled to control a debate on the morality of tax. The government's most senior members \u2013 plus the London mayor \u2013 all acknowledged that they may have fallen foul of a Treasury minister who said it was \"morally wrong\" to pay plumbers in cash. But other ministers took a different view. Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, denied that he ever made a payment in cash. Asked whether he had ever done so, Pickles told the BBC: \"Certainly not.\" Westminster descended into virtual parody of the television satire The Thick of It after the Treasury minister David Gauke said on Monday it was \"morally wrong\" to pay plumbers cash in hand because it denied the revenue vital funds. Ministers issued different responses, indicating a lack of central co-ordination. A No 10 source said that Cameron is likely to have made payments in cash but he had never done so to secure a discount. The source said: \"The prime minister has never paid anyone in cash to get a discount. He may have paid cash but he has never done this to help anyone evade their share of tax.\" Johnson said: \"I've certainly paid a lot of cash in hand,\" he said. Clegg told Channel 4 News: \"I can't remember off the top of my head. I am sure I have paid someone cash, but I certainly have never paid anyone cash in hand knowing that is done in order to avoid tax. That would be entirely wrong.\" Vince Cable, the business secretary, said \"of course\" he had made payments in cash. Asked by ITV News whether he had ever paid anyone cash in hand, Cable said: \"Of course, it's perfectly legal and perfectly moral, providing you're not doing it with the objective of avoiding tax and I certainly wouldn't do that. \"There's nothing wrong with paying people cash. Absolutely nothing wrong at all. What is wrong is if people do it knowing that this is a way to avoid tax and where there is an understanding that somehow the differences will be split. That is wrong. Everyone should be honest and everyone should be ensuring that tax is properly paid.\" Cable used the debate to highlight the government's campaign to crack down on millionaire tax avoiders. \"The real abuse takes place in the multi-million, multi-billion tax dodges and that is where the government is now starting to crack down hard, identifying individuals in big tax avoidance scheme, introducing a general anti-avoidance rule that will stop a lot of these schemes getting through in the first place.\" Jeremy Hunt, the Olympics minister, was asked at a London 2012 security briefing whether he could say \"hand on heart\" that he had never made any cash in hand payments. Hunt said that he had never dodged tax as he dodged the question. \"Let me start by saying David Gauke was saying that tax dodging is wrong and I personally haven't dodged tax. But I am here to talk about the Olympics so I think it is very important that we focus on that topic, if I may.\" James Brokenshire, the home office security minister who was sitting next to Hunt at the briefing, was more forthcoming. \"Would I have made cash payments to avoid VAT? No, I certainly would not.\" Treasury sources moved to play down the significance of Gauke's remarks. They said that he had only described cash-in-hand payments as morally wrong if they were designed to secure a discount from a tradesman avoiding tax. In his remarks on Monday Gauke said the revenue was losing \u00a35bn a year in tax avoidance. HMRC has raised more than \u00a3500m in the past year after launching campaigns focusing on particular areas such as plumbers and electricians. Tariq Dag Khan, of the tradesman website Rated People, said: \"David Gauke's comments that it is morally wrong to pay tradesmen in cash do little to help tradesmen who are struggling in a difficult economic climate. For the reality is that there is little or no alternative to cash payments for many tradesmen, and criticising the whole industry belies a misunderstanding of the situation many customers and tradesmen are in. \"There is a great deal of trust involved when hiring a tradesman for both the tradesman and the customer and therefore cheque payments do not provide a viable alternative especially when, if the cheque bounces, the tradesmen could be dangerously out of pocket and in some circumstances forced out of business as a result.\"",

In addition CJ's Seafood had violated the H-2B foreign worker programme, the Wage and Hour Division said, by misrepresenting its need for temporary foreign workers and refusing to pay the required wage rate. \"This employer took illegal advantage of the H-2B program, which put it in a position to undercut its competition that plays by the rules,\" said Nancy Leppink, deputy administrator of the Wage and Hour Division. \"American workers seeking jobs should not be compelled to accept substandard wages and working conditions due to employers' abuse of temporary foreign worker visa programs.\" The wage and hour division said that $76,608 is due to the 73 workers affected, while the company is also liable for $70,014 in liquidated damages. A further $67,120 is owed in penalties under the fair labor standards act and in penalties for violating the H-2B program. The findings come after a campaign by former guestworkers and the National Guestworkers' Alliance which called for Walmart to drop CJ's Seafood as a supplier. Workers claimed they had been forced to work up to 20 hours a day without overtime. Walmart conducted its own investigation into conditions at CJ's Seafood but said in June it had been \"unable to substantiate claims of forced labour or human trafficking\" at the plant.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The chairman of the Financial Services Authority launched a hard-hitting attack on Tuesday against the \"cynical greed\" of City traders in a wide-ranging speech setting out his stall to be the next governor of the Bank of England. In his second major public address in less than a week, Lord Turner discussed how to restore trust in banking after \"three terrible weeks\" of revelations over the Libor and money-laundering scandals. The FSA chairman also risked inflaming consumer groups by appearing to call for the end of \"free banking\", which he blamed for impeding entrants to the industry and for allowing the mis-selling of payment protection insurance to take place. Setting out his recommendations for repairing banking's reputation in the wake of news that Barclays tried to manipulate Libor and HSBC laundered money for drug barons and despots, Turner cited three factors behind the collapse in trust. \"People have come to doubt the economic benefits of financial liberalisation and of much banking activity; they doubt banks' values; and they doubt whether banks have their interests at heart,\" he said. While Turner pointed to failure of \"flawed\" regulation in the runup to the crisis, he put the emphasis on changing the culture at the top of banks if confidence was to be restored in the industry. He said bank bosses did \"get\" the need for change after the departure of Bob Diamond as Barclays chief executive following the \u00a3290m fine for Libor fixing. \"There is no value in beating about the bush,\" he said. \"Unless management and boards themselves shift the tone from the top in such specific ways,and in addition make effective controls against dishonest behaviour the highest priority throughout the organisation, then we are not going to change the external perception of bankers.\" In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Turner refused to rule himself out as a candidate to take over as Bank of England governor when Sir Mervyn King's second term ends in June 2013. The race has been thrown wide open by the Libor scandal, which has forced another leading candidate, the deputy governor, Paul Tucker, to answer questions about the rate rigging affair, which is expected to draw in at least seven other financial firms. The Barclays fine over Libor covered two periods; 2005-07 when traders were manipulating the rate for their own benefit or rivals; and the 2008 banking crisis when the bank put in lower rates because it was concerned about its public image. While Turner conceded regulators should have noticed Libor rigging during the crisis, he said that spotting rate fixing before then would not have been possible. \"I do not believe these problems could have been spotted from outside except via supervision so intensive as to be prohibitively expensive,\" he said. Turner's speech launched a fresh attack on the regulatory system before the crisis and touched on the \"flawed theory of economic stability\" which focused too much on inflation and not enough on asset booms and rules for banks. The FSA is being broken up and the next Bank governor will be handed more powers to clamp down on banks. Turner signalled that the new regulatory regime would take a tougher stance on the activities of big banks. \"A somewhat more interventionist approach to wholesale conduct issues is likely to be appropriate,\" said Turner. He echoed comments by Andrew Bailey, the FSA's top banking regulator, in signalling the end of free banking. \"We need to recognise a central problem in UK retail banking \u2013 the impact on competition of free-if-in-credit banking,\" he said. \"One reason many people don't like banks is that in the short-term customers are locked in, and in the medium-term competitive choice appears muted. So we need to facilitate new market entry into retail banking.\"",

Until today, the only public expression of interest was AAR's declaration that it might like to buy half of BP's 50% stake. \"Good faith\" negotiations have to take place under the terms of the joint venture contract but BP chief executive Bob Dudley would be daft to do that deal. Being an equal partner with AAR has produced more than enough excitement; being a minority investor in an AAR-controlled company would cause a riot among his shareholders. Rosneft's interest raises the more attractive prospect of a proper auction, with AAR obliged to bid for 100% ownership of TNK-BP to avoid becoming a bed-fellow with Rosneft, a prospect the oligarchs probably would not relish. Just don't expect the outcome in this knotty tale to be straightforward. A simple sale for cash is not the only possible deal. BP could sell its shares to Rosneft and roll over some or all of the proceeds into a new venture in Russia. Or BP could accept Rosneft shares in full or part payment. Alternatively, AAR could turn the tables and offer its stake to Rosneft. But two interested parties are usually better than one when you're the seller \u2013 that must good news for BP.",

On Monday night, the credit rating agency hit Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands with a stinging blow, cutting the outlook on their triple-A ratings from stable to negative. That pushes them into the same bracket, on Moody's measures, as France and Austria \u2013 leaving Finland the only European country with a triple-A rating and stable outlook. What is it about Finland? It is a big country, almost as large as Germany, but with a population of just 5.3 million \u2013 or just 16 people for every square kilometre. Two thirds of the country is covered in forest, and the far north forms part of the Arctic circle. The economy is not all mobile phones and forestry. Finland is also known for its metals, engineering and electronics industries, and exports account for a third of GDP. Income per capita is among the highest in western Europe and the country is celebrated for its generous welfare state. Moody's said that while Finland would not be immune to the eurozone crisis, it had \"strong buffers which differentiate it from the other AAAs\". Among these were the fact it has no debt on a net basis. The IMF estimates Helsinki will collect taxes and other revenues of \u20ac105bn (\u00a382bn) this year, compared with \u20ac101bn of government debt. Finland has a small banking system focused on domestic customers, as well as \"limited exposure to, and therefore relative insulation from, the euro area in terms of trade\", notes Moody's. Finland has also insisted on receiving collateral in exchange for its participation in eurozone bailouts \u2013 which has impressed Moody's. Last week, for example, Helsinki agreed to contribute to the Spanish banking bailout package, but only on the basis that Spain provides it with cash collateral worth \u20ac770m \u2013 around 40% of its share of the bailout. Every time Spain receives a payout from the bailout fund, it will hand over collateral to Finland. The deal was similar to a collateral agreement it struck with Greece in 2011, and could start a trend. Michael Hewson, of CMC Markets, said: \"The reason Finland appears to have escaped [the cut to negative outlook] is due to its insistence on collateral in exchange for aid. This could well see other countries start to demand collateral as well, which could well complicate the swift disbursement of future bailout funds.\" Finland has taken a consistently tough line throughout the eurozone crisis. This month, it threatened to block an agreement to use Europe's bailout fund to start buying Italian and Spanish bonds in the secondary markets. That stance has led some to believe that Finland, rather than Greece, might be the first country to quit the single currency. The US economist Nouriel Roubini wrote on his EconoMonitor website: \"If Greece moves closer to exit and Italy and Spain end up on the verge of losing market access and requiring even more risky financial support from the eurozone core, Finland may decide that the additional credit risk is not worth the benefit.\"",

Chief executive Alison Cooper said:</p> <blockquote> Challenging conditions persist in some markets but we have a strong record of delivering growth in this environment and remain in a good position to continue maximising value for shareholders. <br> </blockquote> <p>On regulation, Imperial said it continued to challenge the idea of plain packaging \"which are not based on credible evidence and will only serve to fuel the illegal trade in tobacco.\" It plans a submission to the UK consulting committee, and expects the outcome of a court hearing in Australia to be announced later in the year.</p> <p>Imperial has added 17p to \u00a324.66 in an uncertain stock market.

      "bodyText": "Cigarette price rises at Imperial Tobacco have helped make up for a fall in volumes, the company said. Earlier this month Imperial said it would be adding 25p to a packet in the UK, on top of the 37P increase in this year's budget. Previous price rises meant net tobacco revenue for the first nine months of the year climbed 3% despite a 3% fall in volumes. Imperial has done well out of selling Cuban cigars in emerging markets, but the eurozone crisis has hit volumes in Spain. Chief executive Alison Cooper said: Challenging conditions persist in some markets but we have a strong record of delivering growth in this environment and remain in a good position to continue maximising value for shareholders. On regulation, Imperial said it continued to challenge the idea of plain packaging \"which are not based on credible evidence and will only serve to fuel the illegal trade in tobacco.\" It plans a submission to the UK consulting committee, and expects the outcome of a court hearing in Australia to be announced later in the year. Imperial has added 17p to \u00a324.66 in an uncertain stock market. Analyst Martin Deboo at Investec said: The third quarter has come in below our expectations with an implied volume decline in the quarter of around 1% against our expectation of positive 2%. Imperial cites mitigating factors and remains comfortable with the 2012 full year consensus. But we are disappointed: there should have been decent share momentum out of the second quarter, and the third quarter presented the weakest volume comparative of the year. Our preference for Imperial over BAT remains, given the valuation discount, but paradise looks to have been postponed by at least another quarter.

    "webTitle": "Europe's immigration challenge", 
    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Migration is changing in fundamental ways, and we must continue to push ourselves to devise systems and approaches that respond to new realities", 
      "body": "<p>Europe faces an immigration predicament. Mainstream politicians, held hostage by xenophobic parties, adopt anti-immigrant rhetoric to win over fearful publics, while the foreign-born are increasingly marginalised in schools, cities, and at the workplace. Yet, despite high unemployment across much of the continent, too many employers lack the workers they need. Engineers, doctors, and nurses are in short supply; so, too, are farmhands and health aides. And Europe can never have enough entrepreneurs, whose ideas drive economies and create jobs.</p> <p>The prevailing scepticism about immigration is not wholly unfounded. Many communities are genuinely polarised, which makes Europeans understandably anxious. But to place the blame for this on immigrants is wrong, and exacerbates the problem. We are all at fault.</p> <p>By not taking responsibility, we allowed immigration to become the scapegoat for a host of other, unrelated problems. The enduring insecurity caused by the global economic crisis, Europe's existential political debates, and the rise of emerging powers is too often expressed in reactions against migrants. Not only is this unjust, but it distracts us from crafting solutions to the real problems.</p> <p>European countries must finally and honestly acknowledge that, like the US, Canada, and Australia, they are lands of immigrants. The percentage of foreign-born residents in several European countries \u2013 including Spain, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Greece \u2013 is similar to that in the US.</p> <p>Yet, despite this, we do not make the necessary investments to integrate newcomers into our schools and workplaces. Nor have we done enough to reshape our public institutions to be inclusive and responsive to our diverse societies. The issue is not how many new immigrants are accepted into the EU, but acknowledging the nature and composition of the societies in which we already live.</p> <p>It is ironic \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 that Europe's anti-immigrant sentiment is peaking just when global structural changes are fundamentally shifting migration flows. The most important transformation is the emergence of new poles of attraction. Entrepreneurs, migrants with PhDs, and those simply with a desire to improve their lives are flocking to places such as Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Mexico, China, and India. In the coming decade, most of the growth in migration will take place in the global south. The west is no longer the \"Promised Land\", placing at risk Europe's ability to compete globally.</p> <p>The ageing of Europe's population is historically unprecedented. The number of workers will decline precipitously, and could shrink by almost one-third by mid-century, with immense consequences for Europe's social model, the vitality of its cities, its ability to innovate and compete, and for relations among generations as the old become heavily reliant on the young. And, while history suggests that countries that welcome newcomers' energy and vibrancy compete best internationally, Europe is taking the opposite tack by tightening its borders.</p> <p>But all is not lost. Europe got itself into this situation through a combination of inaction and short-sighted policymaking. This leaves considerable room for improvement. In fact, there are rays of hope in certain corners of Europe.</p> <p>Consider Sweden, which has transformed its immigration policy by allowing employers to identify the immigrant workers whom they need (the policy has built-in safeguards to give preference to Swedish and EU citizens). In more rational times, these reforms would be the envy of Europe, especially given the relative resilience of Sweden's economy. They certainly have caught the attention of Australia and Canada, which aim to emulate them.</p> <p>There have also been innovations in integrating immigrants.

      "bodyText": "Europe faces an immigration predicament. Mainstream politicians, held hostage by xenophobic parties, adopt anti-immigrant rhetoric to win over fearful publics, while the foreign-born are increasingly marginalised in schools, cities, and at the workplace. Yet, despite high unemployment across much of the continent, too many employers lack the workers they need. Engineers, doctors, and nurses are in short supply; so, too, are farmhands and health aides. And Europe can never have enough entrepreneurs, whose ideas drive economies and create jobs. The prevailing scepticism about immigration is not wholly unfounded. Many communities are genuinely polarised, which makes Europeans understandably anxious. But to place the blame for this on immigrants is wrong, and exacerbates the problem. We are all at fault. By not taking responsibility, we allowed immigration to become the scapegoat for a host of other, unrelated problems. The enduring insecurity caused by the global economic crisis, Europe's existential political debates, and the rise of emerging powers is too often expressed in reactions against migrants. Not only is this unjust, but it distracts us from crafting solutions to the real problems. European countries must finally and honestly acknowledge that, like the US, Canada, and Australia, they are lands of immigrants. The percentage of foreign-born residents in several European countries \u2013 including Spain, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Greece \u2013 is similar to that in the US. Yet, despite this, we do not make the necessary investments to integrate newcomers into our schools and workplaces. Nor have we done enough to reshape our public institutions to be inclusive and responsive to our diverse societies. The issue is not how many new immigrants are accepted into the EU, but acknowledging the nature and composition of the societies in which we already live. It is ironic \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 that Europe's anti-immigrant sentiment is peaking just when global structural changes are fundamentally shifting migration flows. The most important transformation is the emergence of new poles of attraction. Entrepreneurs, migrants with PhDs, and those simply with a desire to improve their lives are flocking to places such as Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, Mexico, China, and India. In the coming decade, most of the growth in migration will take place in the global south. The west is no longer the \"Promised Land\", placing at risk Europe's ability to compete globally. The ageing of Europe's population is historically unprecedented. The number of workers will decline precipitously, and could shrink by almost one-third by mid-century, with immense consequences for Europe's social model, the vitality of its cities, its ability to innovate and compete, and for relations among generations as the old become heavily reliant on the young. And, while history suggests that countries that welcome newcomers' energy and vibrancy compete best internationally, Europe is taking the opposite tack by tightening its borders. But all is not lost. Europe got itself into this situation through a combination of inaction and short-sighted policymaking. This leaves considerable room for improvement. In fact, there are rays of hope in certain corners of Europe. Consider Sweden, which has transformed its immigration policy by allowing employers to identify the immigrant workers whom they need (the policy has built-in safeguards to give preference to Swedish and EU citizens). In more rational times, these reforms would be the envy of Europe, especially given the relative resilience of Sweden's economy. They certainly have caught the attention of Australia and Canada, which aim to emulate them. There have also been innovations in integrating immigrants. Some initiatives, albeit modest, encourage those with immigrant backgrounds to apply for public-sector jobs in police forces, fire departments, media, and elsewhere. Such measures also respond to the urgent need for public institutions that look like the populations they serve. There are many other tools to advance integration. We understand well the importance of early childhood education, and what kinds of programmes can bridge the gap between immigrant and native children. We know as well the importance of finding a job in the integration process. We know how to recognise immigrants' skills better, and how to provide the right kind of vocational training. We know how to ward off discrimination in hiring. But, while we know what to do, we now need to muster the political will to do it. The good news is that, if we get integration right, we will be far more likely to bring publics along on more open immigration policies. Equally important is international co-operation on migration.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Spain announced tough curbs on the short-selling of shares on the Madrid stock exchange on Monday after fears of a second successive summer crisis for the eurozone triggered big falls on the world's financial markets. Interest rates on US Treasury bonds dropped to levels not seen since the 19th century as investors sought safe havens in anticipation that Greece would be the first country to exit the 17-nation single currency area. Madrid announced that it would ban short-selling \u2013 the process whereby dealers sell shares they do not have in the hope of buying them back more cheaply later \u2013 after the interest rate on 10-year Spanish bonds rose to 7.59%, a level unprecedented since the birth of monetary union more than a decade ago. Speculation that Spain will become the fourth eurozone country after Greece, Portugal and Ireland to require formal assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the rest of Europe sent share prices tumbling by 6% in early trading. Other European bourses were also gripped by panic selling \u2013 Italy also announced a short-selling ban \u2013 as it became clear that more Spanish regions, including Catalonia, would follow Valencia in asking for financial help from Madrid. Nick Parsons, of National Australia Bank, said: \"It looks as if we are in for another August crisis. The question for Europe is whether things have got better over the past year, and the answer is no. Very little progress has been made.\" Markets were also unsettled by reports that the failure of Greece to stick to its austerity programme will lead to the IMF cutting off support. The IMF said it was still working with Athens to get the programme back on track, adding that its officials would be arriving in Athens on Tuesday for talks with the coalition government. On Monday night, Moody's changed its outlook for top-rated Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg from stable to negative, warning that they may have to increase support for indebted eurozone states such as Spain and Italy. Moody's also cited an increased chance of Greece leaving the eurozone, which \"would set off a chain of financial sector shocks ... that policymakers could only contain at a very high cost.\" The agency affirmed Finland's AAA rating and stable outlook, but said all four countries were adversely affected by rising uncertainty about the outcome of the euro area debt crisis and the increasing likelihood that greater support would be needed by other euro area countries. Moody's said the burden of that support would fall most heavily on the eurozone's top-rated states and Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg's \"balance sheets are expected to bear the main financial burden of support.\" Reports on Monday from Berlin suggested that the mood in Germany is hardening against providing any more assistance to Greece unless fresh austerity measures are both agreed and implemented. Markets fear that in the absence of bailout cash Greece could be unable to pay its debts by the middle of next month. Spain's emergency action to ban short-selling led to a late rally in share prices, although analysts warned that the respite was likely to prove temporary. Spain's borrowing costs soared higher on Monday, taking it closer to a dangerous national bailout as concern switched from the country's ailing banks to its struggling regional governments. The IBEX index in Spain closed 1.1% down on the day, registering smaller falls than in Germany's DAX (3.2%), France's CAC (2.9%) and Italy's FTSE MIB (2.8%). In London there was not a single gainer in the FTSE 100, which closed 2.1% lower after a fall of more than 117 points. New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 100 points by close of trading, while fears that Europe's recession-hit economy would drag down global growth led to a drop of $3 a barrel in the price of oil. Spain's finance minister, Luis de Guindos, was adamant on Monday that his country would not need to ask for more outside help following the decision by last month's European summit to provide \u20ac100bn (\u00a378bn) for Spain's banks. De Guindos, who will travel to Berlin on Tuesday for talks with Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said: \"Markets are overreacting.\" Jonathan Loynes, of Capital Economics, said: \"It looks almost certain that Spain will need a sovereign bailout as well as a banking package. \"People were hoping that the eurozone crisis would die down over the summer and we could all forget about it until September. It doesn't look like that.\" Analysts estimate it would cost up to \u20ac400bn to bail out the eurozone's fourth-largest economy for the next two and a half years. European commissioner Joaquin Almunia suggested on Monday Spain should try to activate the recently approved bond-buying powers of the eurozone's rescue funds. De Guindos is likely to repeat Spanish pleas for pressure to be put on the European Central Bank (ECB) for it to buy Spain's debt and help push down yields. \"Spain right now is the breakwater in the current uncertainty surrounding the euro. But this goes beyond Spain,\" De Guindos said, adding that the country had done its part by approving economic reforms. ECB president Mario Draghi told Le Monde newspaper on Sunday that buying sovereign bonds was not part of his job. Spain's economy shrank by 0.4% in the second quarter, compared with 0.3% in the first three months of the year. A \u20ac65bn austerity package approved earlier this month has not calmed markets and is expected to deepen Spain's double-dip recession even further. The government now believes recession will extend into next year, with the economy shrinking another half a percent in 2013. Spain's 24% unemployment rate is also thought to be set to remain steady until well into next year. Louise Cooper, of BGC Partners, said the \u20ac100bn package agreed for Spain's banks would not be nearly enough to deal with the country's debt problems. \"I think the austerity package is the last thing Spain needs at the moment,\" she said.",
