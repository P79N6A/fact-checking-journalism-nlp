    "webTitle": "Andrew Tyrie: fresh from the HBOS debacle, now serious about reform", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "London's mayor, Boris Johnson, famously called on \"banker-bashers\" to stop. Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond told the Treasury select committee that there had been enough remorse. It is in large part due to Andrew Tyrie, Conservative chair of that committee, that a brand new apology for the disasters of 2008 was offered up this month. Former HBOS chief executive Sir James Crosby gave up a third of his \u00a3580,000 pension and has also offered to hand back his knighthood after a damning report by the banking commission Tyrie chairs said HBOS bosses were \"delusional\" and guilty of a \"colossal failure of management\". Is this sufficient penance, does Tyrie think? \"I think he's done the right thing, acted honourably.\" For a man who has shed more light on what really went wrong in Britain's banks than any of the regulators, Tyrie is careful with his words. He won't say whether he hopes Vince Cable will ban the trio credited with sinking HBOS from acting as directors \u2013 a move that would see Andy Hornby, one of the three, stripped of his current job as chief executive of bookmaker Coral. Nor will he comment on the resignations this week of Rich Ricci and Tom Kalaris, heads of investment banking and wealth management at Barclays. Nor will he say anything at all about Lord Green, chief executive and chair of HSBC when the bank laundered billions for drug cartels, and now a peer and trade minister. But there is no doubt Tyrie is serious about banking reform. His banking commission's final report, due next month, is awaited with great interest and not a little anxiety \u2013 not least by George Osborne. Tyrie has forced the chancellor's hand once already, with a demand that the \"ringfence\" between banks' retail and investment activities called for in last year's Vickers report be \"electrified\". It is a turn of phrase that has now entered the banking lexicon, and one which Tyrie says may have come to him while out running beside one of the electric fences in his West Sussex constituency. Though its contents remain secret, Tyrie hints that the report will contain new measures on restricting pay, but not bonuses, that the \"approved persons\" list managed by regulators will become far more robust, and that regulators will be offered protection from the lobbying might of the banks. \"What really sticks in the craw of the electorate,\" he says, \"is that what you and I would consider to be very serious offences have been committed, and yet there doesn't seem to be an orange jumpsuit on anyone \u2013 although there may yet be with Libor.\" New laws, he says, may not be the solution because more people could have been prosecuted under existing laws had the regulators had the will and the resources. \"The sheer scale and variety of things that the banks got up to is quite extraordinary. This isn't a few bad apples in a very large barrel \u2013 these are large numbers of people over very long periods, able to conduct malpractice, market abuses and what you and I would call simple fraud.\" Tyrie is an unlikely radical. He went to public school and both Oxford and Cambridge and worked for 20 years for BP and as an adviser to Nigel Lawson \u2013 now a member of the Lords and a vocal member of the banking commission \u2013 before being elected to his safe Chichester seat in 1997. In opposition, he ran two leadership campaigns for Ken Clarke. He opposed the Iraq war, and asked a series of searching questions about the UK's role in extraordinary rendition of terrorist suspects that led to David Miliband being forced to retract untrue statements made by his predecessor as foreign secretary, Jack Straw. Tyrie says he was punished for opposing the war by not being given an office in Portcullis House. Instead, he says, he was stuck in a corner where the authorities knew he would be disturbed by a pneumatic drill, but things have since improved and he now has plenty of space and a river view. He was probably seen as awkward. He is a climate change sceptic, has been nicknamed \"Andrew Tiresome\", and in 2010, despite his ambition, he failed to get a government job. \"Do I look like a toady to you?\" he says with a grin. Instead he beat fellow Conservative Michael Fallon in the ballot for Treasure committee chair, and built it into a power base. In the wake of the Libor scandal, when the government rejected Labour's calls for a judge-led public inquiry into banking, it was Tyrie who managed to command sufficient confidence across parties that a parliamentary commission could do the job. The commission has increased his influence further. It has 20-30 staff plus advisers, and its own QC, Rory Phillips. In six months, the commission took 168 hours of evidence. Proud of his maverick status, Tyrie is not afraid to fire a shot across the bows. The list of questions about government-backed mortgage lending in his select committee report on the budget will not be welcomed in No 11. Nor will the committee's demand, after key budget details appeared in the Evening Standard before the chancellor had even stood up, that pre-briefing journalists on the budget should stop. He quotes Keynes when asked about the government's focus on austerity \u2013 \"when the facts change, I change my mind\" \u2013 and agrees it's possible the policy may turn out to be wrong: \"Yes, that's a risk, and that's what happened in the 1930s. When economists in their lofty way say that the policy-making environment is challenging and subject to a high degree of uncertainty, that's their way of saying the same thing. It may be very boring to hear this but I don't think there would be a great deal of difference on the central issue, that is about the degree of fiscal tightening, whoever was in power, whether Con, Con-Lib, Lib-Lab or Lab.\" He also thinks Osborne may have given too much power to the Bank of England under the reformed City regulatory structure, and that the governor's enhanced role could be a \"point of systemic risk\". But luckily the Treasury select committee exists to scrutinise: \"It is absolutely vital that we do that job with more rigour than ever before.\"",

      "body": "<p> A \"work in progress\" is the polite version of the Treasury select committee's verdict on George Osborne's Help to Buy housing scheme. Riddled with rising damp would be closer to the mark. From the 19 \"outstanding questions\" to the \"advice\" to the government to seek a second opinion from the specialists at the Bank of England, the committee's contempt for the chancellor's flagship budget policy is unmistakable.</p> <p>The main objection to Help to Buy is the risk that unintended consequences occur. Many would agree that it would be terrfiic, in principle, to give a leg-up to creditworthy first-time buyers to enable them to avoid the tyranny of renting. In practice, the government would be diving into the sub-prime lending market if it gives guarantees for up to 20% of the mortgage on homes worth up to \u00a3600,000. It's a dangerous game.</p> <p>First, writing any financial guarantee creates the possibility of loss. The Treasury's idea is that the fees paid by the lenders, the banks and building societies, would cover any loss. But would they? If the fees are set high, the banks won't play. If they're set low, substantial risks will remain with taxpayers. If a happy middle ground exists, Osborne ought to have described it on day one \u2013 otherwise, the government is just praying that house prices never fall.</p> <p>Second, the real problem in the housing market is the lack of new homes. To attempt to stimulate more building by subsidising mortgages and forcing up house prices is a bizarrely roundabout approach. It is long-term, at best. \"If the government's priority was housing supply, its housing measures ought to have concentrated there,\" says the committee. Quite.</p> <p>Third, the government may discover it is easier to get into the game of subsidising mortgages than to get out. One can write the script already: political pressures mount and a supposedly temporary measure gradually becomes permanent in order to get the economy around the next corner. The right moment to withdraw the scheme never seems to arrive.</p> <p>Then there's the objection of a different nature: why haven't purchases of second homes been specifically excluded from Help to Buy? Maybe the Treasury will eventually crack the technicalities but the lack of clarity is disgraceful. \"It is a reflection of the need to think schemes through carefully before announcing them,\" says the committee's report dryly. Actually, it would be better if Help to Buy had never been announced.</p> <h2>The trouble with gold</h2> <p>The world of gold investing divides neatly into believers and non-believers. The former bang on about an intrinsic store of value, the debasement of paper currencies, and the wickedness of central bankers' money-printing machines. The latter \u2013 including this column \u2013 just can't see the point of gold as an investment.</p> <p>Warren Buffett is our champion. Here's his take in last year's letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: \"What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. As 'bandwagon' investors join any party, they create their own truth \u2013 for a while.\"</p> <p>That insight may explain this week's mini-crash in the gold price: when the price stops rising, a fall is bound to happen because latecomers will start to question their own genius. That's the basic problem with gold: there's nothing to fall back on, like a dividend or cash flow; you're just speculating that more doubters will be converted.</p> <p>A violent 9% one-day fall, which happened on Tuesday, still counts as remarkable. Was the trigger the worry that, post-Cyprus, cash-strapped governments will be obliged to sell their reserves? Was is the thought that rip-roaring inflation hasn't yet materialised? Or the reflection that global economy, notwithstanding the IMF's downgraded forecasts, probably isn't going to hell this year?</p> <p>Who knows, and who cares? When doubts infect the gold market, any explanation seems as good as the next. And attempting to predict the next floor is pure guesswork. If $1,600 an ounce was suddenly deemed the \"wrong\" price, is $1,400 a bargain? No thanks.</p> <h2>Barclays cleans house \u2013 well a few rooms</h2> <p>Rich Ricci was \"retired\" by Barclays largely, it seems, because he belonged to Bob Diamond's ancien r\u00e9gime and had collected an embarrassing amount of money over the years, including \u00a317.6m this year. And the racehorses didn't help. That's life, of course.</p> <p>New Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins is entitled to pick his players and it would be odd if he thought his cultural revolution could be achieved by the same old faces. It is hard to believe that Ricci, who is said to enjoy a flutter, would have staked much on his own survival at Barclays.</p> <p>But Ricci's exit, alongside that of Tom Kalaris, the head of the wealth division, prompts the question of why some Barclays long-serving non-executives have survived the cull. Aren't they also part of the old mob? Weren't they the folk who sanctioned the generous pay schemes that came up trumps even as Barclays' share price tanked and the dividend was savaged? Weren't they supposed to be the guardians of the bank's culture? Yes, yes and yes.</p> <p>Barclays chairman Sir David Walker has rejigged his non-executive line-up but it doesn't amount to a full flush. The survival of Sir John Sunderland is the hardest to explain. He has been on the remuneration committee since he joined the Barclays board in 2005, and thus could hardly be more closely associated with pay structures that \"gave the message to staff that the bank valued revenue over customer service,\" as Anthony Salz's review of the bank's culture put it.</p> <p>Yet Sunderland was selected to chair the bank's remuneration committee after last year's awkward departure of Alison Carnwath. What was the thinking there? That senior non-executives, unlike executives, are deemed capable of learning new tricks? Why?</p> <p>Barclays shareholders get the chance to vote at the next week's annual meeting. In all likelihood, traditional Mugabe-style majorities will be restored, including for the pay report. But, before everyone moves on and congratulates themselves on transformation in progress, perhaps an investor or two could press Sunderland on what Barclays pay committee thought it was playing at in the old days.</p> <h2>Decent share option can prevent staff going postal</h2> <p>Mrs Thatcher knew privatisations are digested more easily when staff get a few shares on the cheap. When the Royal Mail flotation arrives (this autumn, probably, if markets hold and public opinion doesn't harden too strongly against), the ambition is the same. The Postal Services Act 2011 said there should be a scheme for \"encouraging or facilitating\" employees to own \"at least\" 10% if the state sells down to zero.</p> <p>Michael Fallon, the trade minister, should use the loose wording to err on the side of generosity. Don't fiddle around with complicated discount schemes \u2013 just get shares in the hands of employees for free. Royal Mail staff have been shabbily treated by profit-participation schemes that never lived up to their hype. And the business might actually be worth more to taxpayers if all staff have a stake. At, say, a valuation of \u00a33bn then 10% distributed among 135,000 is worth about \u00a32,000 a head. Not unreasonable.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boeing's 787 Dreamliner is set to fly again, after the US authorities gave the go-ahead Friday to a redesign of the plane's troubled lithium-ion battery system. The Dreamliner fleet was grounded in January, after incidents of fire and smoke in the batteries of two planes. The global grounding came as just 50 of the planes had been delivered and was the longest of a commercial model in the jet age. The company has been working on a solution with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). FAA administrator Michael Huerta said: \"A team of FAA certification specialists observed rigorous tests we required Boeing to perform and devoted weeks to reviewing detailed analysis of the design changes to reach this decision.\" \"The FAA set a high bar for our team and our solution,\" said Boeing's chairman and chief executive, Jim McNerney. \"We appreciate the diligence, expertise and professionalism of the FAA's technical team and the leadership of FAA administrator Michael Huerta and secretary of transportation Ray LaHood throughout this process.

The company is believed to have come up with a solution that involves greater separation between the batteries' cells and a venting system for any potentially flammable gases. Top US safety inspector the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) and Japanese authorities are still investigating the original causes of the two incidents, one in a plane parked at Boston's Logan airport and the other during flight in Japan. The plane's grounding marked the first time since 1979 that FAA had banned every plane of a particular type from flying. That ban, on the Douglas DC-10, followed a fatal crash and was lifted within a month. The 787's problems have been compounded by its hi-tech design. The Dreamliner is the largest passenger plane to make such extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which are lighter and can hold more energy than other types of batteries. The batteries, however, have also proved volatile and caused fires in smaller planes, cars, computers and mobile devices. Next week the NTSB will hold the second set of hearings this month on lithium-ion batteries and the fire that broke out on the 787 at Logan. The NTSB chairman, Deborah Hersman, has been critical of the \"assumptions\" regulators used before clearing the ground-breaking use of the battery.

    "webTitle": "Fitch downgrades UK credit rating - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Our news story on the Fitch downgrade is now online here: Fitch strips UK of AAA credit rating. Here's a flavour: The UK's credit standing took a further blow on Friday when Fitch Ratings became the second major international agency to strip it of its top-notch credit rating. The move is an embarrassment for the coalition, which promised to protect Britain's rating when it took power in 2010, and will heighten the debate about whether austerity is still the right approach. Fitch trimmed the rating to AA+ from AAA, citing a weaker economic and fiscal outlook. But it returned the outlook to \"stable\", removing the threat of any further rating action, at least in the near term. \"The fiscal space to absorb further adverse economic and financial shocks is no longer consistent with a AAA rating,\" it said in a statement. And as the reaction to the move has now died down, I'm going to shut up the liveblog for the day. Here's the key points: \u2022 You can track the reaction to Fitch's downgrade from 5.06pm. \u2022 Here's the official statement \u2022 George Osborne says there's no credible alternative... \u2022 Shadow chancellor Ed Balls called it 'another devastating blow' to Osborne, and David Cameron \u2022 City analysts reacted calmly. Thanks for reading, and goodnight. Back next week..... Another photo from Washington, catching Osborne and Sir Mervyn King in thoughtful mood: Meanwhile in Washington, finance ministers have agreed not to set hard targets for debt reduction. Reuters has the details Another important story to flag up... Britain is launching legal action against a plan to introduce a financial transaction tax in eleven eurozone countries. The government says it is worried that the plan will affect banks and institutions in countries outside the scheme - in other words, hurt the City.. From Washington, Larry Elliott reports: The scheme, also known as a Tobin tax, would put a levy on all euro transactions anywhere in the world. But hopes for it suffered a setback when George Osborne said in Washington that the UK was taking the case to the European court of justice (ECJ). \"I am not against financial transaction taxes in principle,\" the chancellor said, noting that the UK put stamp duty on shares. \"But I am concerned about the extra-territorial aspects of the European commission's proposals. It's quite a dramatic move from the UK. FTT supporters aren't impressed - the Robin Hood Tax campaign called it \"the last refuge of a chancellor who has lost the argument\". Here's the full story: George Osborne to challenge proposed financial transaction tax in court The International Monetary Fund has taken another swipe at the government's budget plans tonight. In an interview with the BBC's Hardtalk programme, Christine Lagarde was asked whether the UK government needed show more flexibility. She replied that Britain's recent \"weak growth\" meant the government could now reconsider its plans (effectively repeating her point from earlier this week). Here's the quote: We are saying with this medium-term, strong anchoring of fiscal consolidation, the pace has to be adjusted depending on the circumstances and given the weak growth that we have observed lately ... now might be the time to consider. The IMF has previously backed Osborne's plans. And the reference to \"medium-term, strong anchoring of fiscal consolidation\" shows it hasn't lost all faith in the UK. Here's a second statement from the Treasury tonight, insisting that the UK economy is improving: Though it is taking time, we are fixing this country's economic problems. The deficit is down by a third, a million and a quarter new private-sector jobs have been created and the credibility we have earned means households and businesses are benefiting from near record low interest rates. The test will come next Thursday, when the first estimate of UK economic output in January, February and March is released. If GDP has fallen then Britain will be a triple-dip recession. Over in Washington at the G20 meeting, George Osborne is refusing to be beaten down by Fitch's downgrade. Speaking to the Financial Times, the chancellor argued that there was no 'credible' alternative to his plans. Osborne said: While of course there are ongoing economic challenges in the UK, I don\u2019t feel a particularly strong political challenge to our economic policy. I don\u2019t feel under particular pressure politically because I don\u2019t see anyone coming up with a credible alternative. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenbeg Bank, agrees that Fitch's downgrade has little impact economically. He points out that the UK deficit is not actually expected to fall this year (it is forecast to be \u00a3121bn, versus \u00a3120bn in 2012-2013) Wood commented: The downgrade comes hot on the heels of the spat this week between the IMF and the UK government, about whether to ease back on consolidation. It will be further ammunition for the Labour opposition. Although in reality the arguments about Plan A and Plan B are pretty meaningless. The Chancellor has more or less switched to Plan B already. He does not expect government borrowing to fall between FY2011/12 and FY2013/14. Ignoring all his questionable fiddles to get the measured deficit down, the Chancellor expects to borrow more than \u00a3100bn in the final fiscal year of the current parliament. It is hard to imagine a credible plan to borrow much more than that. Indeed, the stable outlook from Fitch relies on continued commitment to consolidation. There's a pretty muted reaction in the City tonight to Fitch's downgrade. Economists and traders were already well aware of the state of the British economy, having digested the economic forecasts in last month's budget. And Britain's credit rating had already lost its AAA status when Moody's made its own downgrade in February. The pound is still down on the day (see 5.33pm for a chart), but a fall of 0.5 cents isn't a big move. Here's some early reaction: Torben Kaaber, CEO at Saxo Capital Markets: Poor George Osborne really has had a bad few days, not only has the IMF turned its back on him, Fitch has just downgraded the UK to AA+; a painful end to the week. This further adds to the negativity around GBP and the perceived lack of policy to address the UK\u2019s weak economic growth; specifically it was the poor economic growth that was highlighted by both Moody\u2019s and Fitch as the key elements in their decisions to cut. This downgrade set against a background of weakening UK economic data and the Bank of England likely to continue to add monetary stimulus would suggest that GBP will stay under pressure for now. Either way, shaky ground ahead, however given Osborne\u2019s strong rhetoric to date, it seems the man is not for turning. David Tinsley of BNP Paribas For now the UK government is likely to stick to their existing plans for consolidation. But if growth falls short of already modest forecasts then pressure will build still further. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight We suspect that there is likely to be little, if any, economic or market fall-out from Fitch\u2019s decision to strip the UK\u2019s of its rating, especially as the new AA+ rating has a stable outlook attached to it, which means that there are unlikely to be any further changes by Fitch to the rating for at least the next two years. Fitch's downgrade has come as George Osborne attends the meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. Not the best timing for the chancellor, points out Channel 4's economics editor, Faisal Islam. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has called the downgrade \"another humiliating blow\" to the government, and repeated Labour's jibe that Osborne is a \"downgraded chancellor\". Here's his full response: This is another humiliating blow to a Prime Minister and Chancellor who said keeping our AAA rating was the number one test of their economic and political credibility. And it ends a disastrous week for George Osborne\u2019s economic policy after the IMF downgraded its UK economic forecasts again and warned Britain needs a plan B for jobs and growth. It\u2019s not the views of the credit rating agencies, but the economic realities they are responding to which should be ringing alarm bells at the Treasury. Fitch is clear that their decision is a result of the weak growth performance of the UK in recent years. They are responding to nearly three years of stagnation, rising unemployment and billions more borrowing to pay for this economic failure. This downgraded Chancellor needs to wake up and realise that his failing economic policies are causing long-term damage and Britain\u2019s families and businesses are paying the price. When even your biggest allies \u2013 the IMF and the credit rating agencies \u2013 abandon you it really is time to put political pride aside and finally act to kickstart the economy. Fitch's downgrade comes at the end of a difficult week for George Osborne. The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that the government should ease the pace of its austerity programme, given the weak state of the economy. On Wednesday, Britain's unemployment rate rose to 7.9%. Then on Thursday, the IMF's Christine Lagarde repeated that Osborne should rethink and promised that her officials would conduct a thorough investigation into the health of the UK economy next month. Fitch is the first agency to cut Britain's credit rating since last month's budget \u2013 the axe has been hovering since it put the UK on \"rating watch negative\" four weeks ago. Standard &amp; Poor's is now the only Big Three rating agency to still rank the UK as AAA (Moody's didn't even wait for the budget). This puts the UK in a similar position as France (who are only AAA with Fitch). Critics of George Osborne are likely to seize on Fitch's point that Britain's budget deficits are now forecast to be higher than expected last year (the third 'ratings driver' in the statement at 5.12pm) Fitch blames \"the weak growth performance of the UK economy in recent years\", which it says are partly due to \"headwinds of private and public sector deleveraging and the eurozone crisis\". Clearly Osborne can't be blamed for the euro's woes. But many Keynesian economists have argued that it was a blunder to attempt an austerity programme while many companies, and households, were also looking to pay down their debts. The Treasury has responded to Fitch's downgrade, arguing that the move doesn't mean chancellor George Osborne should change course: A spokesman said: This is a stark reminder that the UK cannot simply run away from its problems, or refuse to deal with a legacy of debt built up over a decade. Fitch themselves say the government's 'continued policy commitment to reducing the underlying budget deficit' is one of the main reasons UK debt now has a 'stable' outlook. The pound is down half a cent against the dollar today, following Fitch's announcement, to $1.523. That's not a major move really, and as you can see sterling had actually been sliding all afternoon.... Fitch's statement is online here. The new rating is AA+ with a stable outlook, which means Fitch is not anticipating a further downgrade in the near future. Fitch says it took the decision to downgrade Britain's triple-A rating because of the country's deteriorating economic climate. It now believes Britain's gross debt will peak at 101% of GDP in 2015-16. A debt mountain larger than the UK's annual economic outlook is not consistence with a top-notch credit rating. Here's the key points from tonight's statement: \u2022 Fitch now forecasts that general government gross debt (GGGD) will peak at 101% of GDP in 2015-16 (equivalent to 86% of GDP for public sector net debt, PSND) and will only gradually decline from 2017-18. This compares with Fitch's previous projection for GGGD peaking at 97% and declining from 2016-17 and the 'AAA' median of around 50%. \u2022 Fitch previously commented that failure to stabilise debt below 100% of GDP and place it on a firm downward path towards 90% of GDP over the medium term would likely trigger a rating downgrade. Despite the UK's strong fiscal financing flexibility underpinned by its own currency with reserve currency status and the long average maturity of public debt, the fiscal space to absorb further adverse economic and financial shocks is no longer consistent with a 'AAA' rating. \u2022 Higher than previously projected budget deficits and debt primarily reflects the weak growth performance of the UK economy in recent years, partly due to headwinds of private and public sector deleveraging and the eurozone crisis. Fitch has revised down its forecast economic growth in 2013 and 2014 to 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively, from 1.5% and 2.0% at the time of the last review of the UK's sovereign ratings in September 2012. The UK economy is not expected to reach its 2007 level of real GDP until 2014, underscoring the weakness of the economic recovery. \u2022 Despite significant progress in reducing public sector net borrowing (PSNB from a peak of 11.2% of GDP (GBP159bn) in 2009-10, the budget deficit remains 7.4% of GDP (excluding the effect of the transfer of Royal Mail pensions) and is not expected to fall below 6% of GDP and GBP100bn until the end of the current parliament term. The slower pace of deficit reduction means that the next government will be required to implement substantial spending reductions (and/or tax increases) if public debt is to be stabilised and reduced over the medium term. Breaking News: Fitch has downgraded the UK's triple-A rating, by one notch, to AA+. My colleague Katie Allen has been looking into sales of physical gold over the last week and has some interesting numbers from the Royal Mint. The battering in financial markets for gold has brought out the bargain hunters in the physical market and bars, nuggets and coins are going gangbusters. In India, the world's biggest gold buyer, the wedding season is boosting sales further, jewellers report. In the UK the Royal Mint tells us that bullion sales have rocketed. Richard Samuels, bullion manager at The Royal Mint said: Demand for gold bullion coins during April has seen an increase of over 150% in sales on the previous month, and over 200% on the same period in 2012. Shane Bissett, director of bullion and commemorative coin at The Royal Mint said: Since the dip in the price of gold we have seen increased demand for our gold bullion coins from the major coin markets, and this presently shows no sign of abating. The Royal Mint continues to supply to its customers and is increasing production to accommodate the higher demand. The gold price has risen today, incidentally, to $1,402 per ounce. Surprising scenes in the Italian parliament -- Alessandra Mussolini MP, granddaughter of Benito, turned up for today's presidential vote with \"The Devil Wears Prodi\" written on the back of her top. This led to hissing and booing from centre-left MPs, who had selected former prime minister Romano Prodi as their favoured candidate for the presidency (see 1.25pm for details). Mussolini is a member of Silvio Berlusconi's PdL party, who are refusing to support their former rival. We don't have the results of the latest ballot yet, though. Over in Washington, we're expecting a statement from G20 finance ministers later this afternoon. Details are starting to leak \u2026 the Wall Street Journal reckons we'll get a repeat of their previous comments about committing to avoid a currency war \u2026 The top civil servant at Cyprus's finance ministry has savaged the country's international lenders as \"forces of occupation\" with no compassion for human rights, at the start of an official judicial probe into the crisis. Christos Patsalides told the inquiry that the officials who negotiated with Cyprus had been \"unrelenting\", and had driven it into its current plight. Patsalides said: With the imposition of Germany and the IMF...they shot a pigeon with an atomic bomb\". Here's more details via Reuters: Asked whether forcing losses on depositors was compatible with their individual rights, Patsalides replied: \"When you are dealing with forces of occupation, they don't talk about human rights.\" Cyprus, which had modelled itself as an offshore financial services centre for lack of any other resources, now faces a grim future with its reputation in tatters and its economy deep in recession. \"They destroyed an economic system that worked,\" Patsalides said. \"Yes, we have our shortcomings, but the magnitude of the punishment is far greater than the size of the problem.\" Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has waded into the debate over excessive monetary easing by suggesting that the European Central Bank should take the opportunity to reduce liquidity. The comments created some concern in the financial markets -- with several eurocrisis experts pointing out that the weakest areas of the eurozone would benefit from more easing, not tightening at this stage. After all, the IMF's Christine Lagarde argued this week that the ECB is the only central bank with the room to do more. I've now found the comments, which were made in an interview with Germany's Wirtschafts Woche. It's online here. Here's the key quotes: There is a lot of money in the market, in my opinion too much money...If the ECB tries to exploit leeway to reduce the large liquidity a little, I can only welcome this. Sch\u00e4uble went on, though, to recognise that the economic crisis is not over, adding: We must not forget in Germany that many European countries are still in a precarious position growth. Worth noting that eurozone inflation actually dropped to 1.7% last month - hardly a sign of an overheating economy. And many banks have begun repaying early the cheap loans they took from the ECB over a year ago. Here's the early reaction: You won't be surprised to learn that Italian MPs have again failed to elect a president, at their third round of voting today. Now the fourth round, where a successful candidate just needs a straight majority (not the two-thirds mandate of earlier rounds). The centre-left Democratic party has set up a clash with Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) by choosing former prime minister Romano Prodi as its candidate. That could prompt an early general election, as PDL has refused to accept Prodi. He and Berlusconi were fierce opponents through the last decade \u2013 Prodi defeated his rightwing rival in the general election of 2006, only to be ousted in 2008, when Berlusconi returned to office. The fourth round starts in around an hour's time: Finland's parliament has given its approval to the Cyprus bailout, at two votes in Helsinki this lunchtime. A total of 86 MPs backed Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen\u2019s six-party coalition, with 65 against and 48 MPs absent (figures via Bloomberg). The country's grand committee (which oversees EU policy) then voted 16 \u2013 9 to back the aid package. As we wrote yesterday, Cyprus's government is planning to hold its own vote to approve (or potentially reject) the programme agreed with Brussels, the ECB and the IMF. The Greek government has pledged not to deport migrant workers who were shot this week after asking for their unpaid wages, after three supervisors suspected of firing on the group were arrested. The shooting of 28 Bangladeshi strawberry pickers shot in the Nea Manolada area prompted a public outcry, and coverage in the international media. Visiting the site today, public order minister Nikos Dendias announced this morning that the victims would not be expelled from Greece, and said the government would crack down on the use of unregistered workers. Kathemerini adds: The brutal assault does not only violate Greek laws but also every sense of humanity and has no relation to Greece's culture, Dendias said after speaking with local police chiefs. Greek police have issued a statement this morning, saying that they have now detained three men near the village where the shootings took place on Wednesday. Two of the Greek men, aged 39 and 27, were arrested at their lawyer's office. The third, aged 21, was stopped during a road check. according to AP. European stock markets are up this morning, partly driven by hopes that the G20 will make some progress towards repairing the global economy today. FTSE 100: up 33 points at 6277, + 0.5% German DAX: up 37 points at 7510, +0.5% French CAC: up 44 points at 3643, +1.24% Spanish IBEX: up 120 points at 7932, +1.5% Italian FTSE MIB: up 330 points at 15,811. 2.1% Brenda Kelly, market analyst at IG, points out that there are few fundamental reasons for traders to be cheerier: Equity markets ramped up small gains in early trade, showing a recovery from yesterday\u2019s mediocre performance. The cautious sentiment seems to be hinged on a positive outcome from the meeting of finance leaders in Washington today. Corporate and economic data from both across the water and closer to home have failed to lend any true traction to recent rally. And Kit Juckes of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale points out that share prices are still benefiting from the relaxed monetary policy that is causing such concern to fast-growing emerging nations (see 8.51am). Heads up: Germany's constitutional court has announced that it will hear a wide-ranging complaint into Europe's rescue packages in June. The two-day hearing, set for 11-12 June, will examine whether the European Central Bank's new bond-buying scheme or OMT (Outright Monetary Transactions) violates the German constitution. Germany's top judges will also consider the ECB's earlier SMP bond-buying programme (used to stabilise the borrowing costs of Spain and Italy in 2011), and its Emergency Liquidity Assistance (which propped up banks in Cyprus). as well. The court, in Karlsruhe, ruled seven months ago that the European Stability Mechanism (the \u20ac700bn rescue fund set aside for bailouts) did not infringe budget sovereignty of the German parliament. This new case will also see it consider the ESM again. The UK government and the International Monetary Fund are preparing for a serious scrap over Britain's fiscal plans next month. IMF officials are due in London in May to conduct their annual assessment \u2013 and are widely expected to challenge George Osborne's policies (following Christine Lagarde's concern over the UK's weak growth). The Treasury, though, is planning an aggressive response \u2013 suggesting a clash that could potentially influence the economic debate beyond the UK. According to the Financial Times, an unnamed IMF official is even harking back to the killing of Bulgarian dissident writer Georgi Markov back in 1978: IMF economists concede they may need to watch out for \u201cpoisoned umbrellas\u201d for their so-called \u201cArticle IV\u201d mission to London. One aide to Mr Osborne said: \u201cIf they recommend we loosen fiscal policy, we won\u2019t do it. We think they are wrong.\u201d Mr Osborne believes that IMF criticism of his policies is unfair, as Britain\u2019s 1 per cent fiscal contraction this year is in line with the fund\u2019s general recommendations for advanced economies. Not sure the umbrella reference is in the very best taste... Italy's industrial sector has suffered another slump in demand. Industrial orders tumbled by 7.9% in February, compared to a year ago, a sharper fall than analysts had expected. On a seasonally adjusted basis, orders were down 2.5% month on month in February, on top of a 1.4% decline in January. That adds to fears that the eurozone economy weakened towards the end of December. The G20 will not rebuke Japan over its new aggressive monetary easing policies, according to its finance minister, Taro Aso. The Yen fell by over 1% against other currencies this morning after Aso told reporters that finance ministers will not make any official complaint over \"Abenomics\". In response, the yen has fallen to over \u00a599 to the US dollar. The world's leading emerging and developing countries have sounded the alarm this morning over dangers of huge monetary stimulus programmes. In a joint communique, the group of 24 emerging and developing countries warned central banks in \"advanced\" economies that their unconventional policies would cause huge damage: The G24, which includes Brazil, India and South Africa, said: We remain concerned about the fragility and pace of the global recovery because of the protracted difficulties and uncertainties in many advanced economies, including the euro area and the United States. We call on advanced economies to take into account the negative spillover effects on the emerging and developing countries of prolonged unconventional monetary policies. AFP has a full report here. The quantitative easing programmes launched by the US since the crisis began have long concerned the G24, who saw \"hot money\" flow into their economies after the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity. The Bank of Japan's bold new scheme to double its monetary base and finally slay deflation is a new worry \u2013 the IMF warned this week that the seeds of the next crisis could be being sown now. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events in the eurozone crisis and across the world economy. The battle between growth and austerity is centre stage today as the world's most powerful finance ministers and central bank governors gather in Washington for the G20 talks. Overnight, European commissioner Olli Rehn signalled that the eurozone may finally be prepared to bow to pressure and relax its fiscal consolidation programme in some countries \u2013 where the belt tightening is clearly doing more harm than good. Speaking to Reuters, Rehn declared: In the early phase of the crisis it was essential to restore the credibility of fiscal policy in Europe because that was fundamentally questioned by market forces... There was no choice. Decisive action was taken. Now, as we have restored the credibility in the short-term, that gives us the possibility of having a smoother path of fiscal adjustment in the medium-term. It could be an important shift in Brussels' position, as the G20 are expected to discuss whether to agree on a collective \"co-ordinated debt reduction plan\" for the coming years. Rehn's comments also come as the International Monetary Fund appeared to shift its position on the balance between fiscal consolidation and stimulus. Some journalists are talking of a power battle within the Fund, with more Keynesian elements perhaps taking the upper hand. But talk of more stimulus measures in the world's biggest economies may be alarming the developing world \u2013 who have issued a warning about the push for ever-more liquidity (more to follow). In Europe, the Finnish parliament is due to debate the Cyprus bailout. The news yesterday that Cypriot MPs will hold their own vote is causing some jitters. And Italian MPs will continue to vote on their next president, after two failed ballots yesterday. I'll be tracking the latest developments in Europe, and beyond, through the day.",

The Chancellor has more or less switched to Plan B already.</p> <p>He does not expect government borrowing to fall between FY2011/12 and FY2013/14. Ignoring all his questionable fiddles to get the measured deficit down, the Chancellor expects to borrow more than \u00a3100bn in the final fiscal year of the current parliament.

Fitch is clear that their decision is a result of the weak growth performance of the UK in recent years. They are responding to nearly three years of stagnation, rising unemployment and billions more borrowing to pay for this economic failure.</p> <p>This downgraded Chancellor needs to wake up and realise that his failing economic policies are causing long-term damage and Britain\u2019s families and businesses are paying the price.

This compares with Fitch's previous projection for GGGD peaking at 97% and declining from 2016-17 and the 'AAA' median of around 50%.</p> <p>\u2022 Fitch previously commented that failure to stabilise debt below 100% of GDP and place it on a firm downward path towards 90% of GDP over the medium term would likely trigger a rating downgrade. Despite the UK's strong fiscal financing flexibility underpinned by its own currency with reserve currency status and the long average maturity of public debt, the fiscal space to absorb further adverse economic and financial shocks is no longer consistent with a 'AAA' rating.</p> <p>\u2022 Higher than previously projected budget deficits and debt primarily reflects the weak growth performance of the UK economy in recent years, partly due to headwinds of private and public sector deleveraging and the eurozone crisis. Fitch has revised down its forecast economic growth in 2013 and 2014 to 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively, from 1.5% and 2.0% at the time of the last review of the UK's sovereign ratings in September 2012. The UK economy is not expected to reach its 2007 level of real GDP until 2014, underscoring the weakness of the economic recovery.</p> <p>\u2022 Despite significant progress in reducing public sector net borrowing (PSNB from a peak of 11.2% of GDP (GBP159bn) in 2009-10, the budget deficit remains 7.4% of GDP (excluding the effect of the transfer of Royal Mail pensions) and is not expected to fall below 6% of GDP and GBP100bn until the end of the current parliament term. The slower pace of deficit reduction means that the next government will be required to implement substantial spending reductions (and/or tax increases) if public debt is to be stabilised and reduced over the medium term.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-04-19T16:17:17.953Z\">at 5.17pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51716b8ce4b01ca5fdd819a1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-19T16:06:36.630Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FITCH DOWNGRADES UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Breaking News: Fitch has downgraded the UK's triple-A rating, by one notch, to AA+.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51716420e4b01ca5fdd8199e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-04-19T15:34:56.919Z\">4.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Goldbugs swarmed on bullion in April, says Royal Mint</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KatieAllenGdn\"><strong>Katie Allen</strong></a> has been looking into sales of physical gold over the last week and has some interesting numbers from <strong><a href=\"http://www.royalmint.com/\">the Royal Mint</a></strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The battering in financial markets for gold has brought out the bargain hunters in the physical market and bars, nuggets and coins are going gangbusters.</p> <p>In India, the world's biggest gold buyer, the wedding season is boosting sales further, jewellers report.</p> <p>In the UK the Royal Mint tells us that bullion sales have rocketed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Richard Samuels</strong>, bullion manager at <strong>The Royal Mint</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Demand for gold bullion coins during April has seen an increase of over 150% in sales on the previous month, and over 200% on the same period in 2012.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Shane Bissett</strong>, director of bullion and commemorative coin at The Royal Mint said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Since the dip in the price of gold we have seen increased demand for our gold bullion coins from the major coin markets, and this presently shows no sign of abating.

The Office of Fair Trading has launched an investigation into GSK, alleging it abused its market dominance by agreeing so-called \"pay for delay\" agreements between 2001 and 2004 to protect the position of its drug Seroxat. The regulator claims Alpharma, Genetics UK and Norton Healthcare were paid by GSK to delay production of cheaper copycat versions of the drug which could have saved the NHS millions. GSK, the UK's largest pharmaceutical company, admitted agreements were reached but said they did not lead to delays in the generic versions coming to market. If the OFT proves its case, it could hit GSK with a fine worth 30% of its UK turnover during 2001-04, which averaged \u00a31.4bn per year.

      "bodyText": "Kirstie Allsopp, TV presenter, also designs a homeware range for M&amp;S I'm very proud to have a range in Marks &amp; Spencer, although I think I can be honest about what I feel. I used to buy a lot of clothing from M&amp;S \u2013 I've always been a fan, and I adored their Autograph range [famous fashion designers were brought in to collaborate on collections]. There are fashion designers whose stuff I wouldn't buy at the top end, but who did a diffusion line for Autograph when it first started, and I have some pieces from that range that I still wear. But M&amp;S doesn't have that any more. When I talk to the girls at work \u2013 many of them in their mid- to late-20s and on low incomes \u2013 they tell me they shop at Primark. I don't see them buying anything from Marks &amp; Spencer. It has become about the food, which out-cools and out-sexes the clothes. Something, somewhere got a little bit lost. I trust Marks &amp; Spencer, but I don't have the sense any more that I will make a real discovery. My fashion advice mainly comes from weekend newspaper supplements, and I don't see a lot of M&amp;S stuff in them. I know they do makeup, shoes, accessories \u2013 but I can't remember the last time I saw something in a magazine and thought, \"ooh\", and then saw it was from M&amp;S. M&amp;S can get its position back. The staff have a great attitude, and the company as a whole is a good one. I just think its womenswear has lost its edge. Jess Cartner-Morley, Guardian fashion editor There is one straightforward factor contributing to M&amp;S's woes. There is no one manning the tiller, fashionably speaking. The current collections fall between two reigns: they were conceived after Kate Bostock left last year, but have not been steered by her replacement, Belinda Earl \u2013 her influence will not be seen until the first autumn ranges land at the end of this summer. I have observed the dynamics at M&amp;S for some time, and it strikes me that a healthy relationship between the CEO and the person fighting fashion's corner is key to good product. It will be fascinating to see what impact Earl has next season. In part, the problem for M&amp;S is that the competition has got so much better. The British high-street shopper is now thoroughly spoilt. Once, M&amp;S filled a gap between fast fashion, which was cheap as chips but shoddily made, and the stodgy, elasticated-waistband fare of department store fashion. But the fast-fashion market has improved its production values, while a new category of grownup high street stores, such as Reiss and Cos, has emerged. M&amp;S, once front and centre of our clothing consciousness, has to fight for airspace. There has been a tendency to fight for attention by filling the rails with \"trend-led\" clothes, which are often successful in winning media attention, but don't deliver strong sales on the shopfloor. As a nation, we still identify strongly with M&amp;S. It is a part of Britishness in a way no other brand is. Each of us has a an opinion on what M&amp;S should be selling, just as every football fan has a view on the team their manager should field. Here's my own tuppenceworth on how M&amp;S should alter their offer: by refining the colour palette. Walk on to the womenswear floor and you find yourself in a hectic, multicolour world. Less pink, yellow and red, and more bottle-green, navy and off-white would instantly update the environment. Yes, you might annoy the odd customer who was hellbent on fuschia, but you can't please all of the people all of the time. The silver lining is that many women don't realise how much good stuff there still is in M&amp;S. (I'm talking flagship stores. Sorry, provinces.) Recently I've bought a phenomenal leather pencil skirt with a gold zip, beautiful fabric and construction, for under \u00a3200, and a cream silk blouse with coral pocket borders that looks like it came from Paris for \u20ac200 rather than Oxford Street for \u00a345. Jenny Eclair, comedian and writer I have had the almost overwhelming desire to snatch things out of the hands of women who are hovering around the Per Una stand, particularly when they are going into Per Una overdrive and getting everything to match. Per Una is the heroin of middle-aged women's clothing. You start off with just a little bit \u2013 maybe a waterfall cardigan in jade with some beading around the neckline. Snazzy. And before you know it, your wardrobe is bulging with appliqued skirts and embroidered jumpers. I think it's for those women who have completely lost their inner rock chick and have to find another path. Marks &amp; Spencer could very easily get it right if they kept it simple. Where they go wrong is when they start to ornament things with frills or beading. What people want is to go to M&amp;S and buy a good mac, a good white shirt, a denim skirt, a jumper, maybe in cashmere. With their colour, they go a little bit lurid \u2013 I sometimes go in and it makes my teeth hurt. I do buy from Marks. I buy V-neck jumpers, and black cardigans. There is a great demographic of peculiar women who can't wait to get to the appliqued-skirt time of life. There is still an M&amp;S die-hard population \u2013 you see them in market towns. It's a shrinking breed of women, but I think Marks are still loyal to them. I gig a lot, and M&amp;S food has completely revolutionised touring, because they're at motorway service stations now. The days of Ginsters sausage rolls are over \u2013 now you can get chargrilled squid if you so desire. But I do think somebody needs to take a very stern hand with the clothes. They need to get some stylish middle-aged women, people like India Knight, who could actually just boss them around a bit. They have a terrible tendency to go for lilac clothes. I'd love to go on some kind of panel, giving a thumbs up or down as people were paraded in front of me. Richard Perks, director of retail research, Mintel There are two main drivers for M&amp;S \u2013 womenswear and food. The food is doing well, but the problems are with the womenswear. They did the right thing in splitting it up into different sub-brands, but those brands are now insufficiently differentiated. They're also too \"old\". The great thing about Per Una when it launched was that it was young fashions engineered for older customers, but the \"young\" look has gone. Historically, you were dragged in there by your parents and swore never to go in again, and then around the age of 30 you happened to go in and thought, \"Oh, that's quite good.\" But it doesn't seem to be picking up those younger customers now. Debenhams is sitting where M&amp;S should be, and does a good job, because its brands are differentiated. There's a failure to understand what older people want. Sometimes you feel the merchandise is bought by a 25-year-old [M&amp;S buyer] who has a caricatured granny in mind. Older people don't want to be sold down to. That is why Per Una did so well, because it looked young. That's what they've got to get back to. M&amp;S always did well in a recession \u2013 people went back to it because it was good quality and value. In boom times, it tended to over-engineer its products and they got too expensive. So it would have a bad start to the recession, but it would simplify its products, make them cheaper and clean up \u2013 that hasn't happened this time. I think Marc Bolland has to take responsibility for that. Lead times are long \u2013 however much you like the idea of fast fashion, most things have to be planned in advance. Belinda Earl [former chief executive of Debenhams and Jaeger] joined in September, and she couldn't really have any significant impact until autumn/winter this year. Thing have drifted; they need to take those sub-brands and give them their own personality. Lynne Franks, PR expert and champion for women's empowerment I have bought from Marks &amp; Spencer. Some of the basics are still pretty good and over the years they have had wonderful things \u2013 great cashmere, good knitwear. But I went in this season and there was nothing there I wanted to buy. I don't find it enticing, and that's a shame. There are always some good bits, but generally the shape is not right, the cut is not right. What would I suggest they do? Get a new design team. A lot of women who are not young buy fashion, but wouldn't shop at M&amp;S. I don't think M&amp;S has to go younger, just do better stuff. Women of my age, 50-plus, have money to spend and love fashion. We grew up in the 1960s, and don't want to look like frumps. M&amp;S could really take ownership of that market in the high street, but they have to realise the 50-plus woman today is much more stylish, and knowledgable than their mothers probably were. Kim Winser, former chief executive of Pringle and Aquascutum, and director of womenswear at Marks &amp; Spencer until 2000. Now runs Winser London It's all about passion for product. That's what M&amp;S has to turn its attention to \u2013 get back to really good, beautiful, quality products. I buy food from M&amp;S, but not clothing \u2013 I haven't found that combination of fashionability, style and quality. They do a number of different brand names \u2013 too many. By focusing on a few, they could use each brand to focus on a certain customer group, and gradually build up the value of that brand to that group \u2013 they will begin to love it and trust it and know it's for them. When I was there we launched Autograph. It was about bringing in some of the best designers in Britain and capturing what they were good at. The designer collaborations can work, but only if it really does represent what that designer is famous for. I don't think it's about the size of the company, I think it's about the people. There are too many excuses about business and bureaucracy, but the company is run by people, and I was definitely left to run womenswear, which at the time was a \u00a32bn business. I was given that responsibility and accountability. I loved it, and as a team of people, that was one of the reasons we had market-share growth, because we really did love the customer and the product. So it can be done, whatever the size of the business, but I think it depends on the people. Lifestyles change, and it's about a company constantly innovating, looking at what's happening and also predicting what's going to happen. To do that, you have to be absolutely in tune with your customer and what they want, and focus on what your brand is good at. I'm looking from the outside now, but that's where M&amp;S was always a very successful business, because it put the customer first. Susie Lau, fashion blogger for Style Bubble M&amp;S lacks focus in its product. It tries to cater to many different types of women in its various ranges, and doesn't do one thing very well. M&amp;S has come up against companies that do good-quality, timeless fashion with a wider appeal \u2013 stores such as Uniqlo or Cos. M&amp;S was once renowned for being the store where you bought your first bra, for instance, but there are so many more options now. We have a nostalgic attachment to M&amp;S, but I don't know many people my age who go in there. The only time I do is when I'm shopping with my boyfriend's nan. I do look at its lookbooks [the catalogues produced for the fashion press], and I wrote about a selection of M&amp;S stuff for the Guardian a few months ago. It does have nice products, but it has a problem communicating that within its stores. The outlets are very rigid, they don't entice you in as a fashion store. Even if they have good products, they're buried behind the food store, or you have to go through various ranges to get to where you want. I don't think M&amp;S needs to position itself as a fashion-forward store. It's more about finding what it does best \u2013 it's really strong in cashmere, in basics \u2013 and concentrating on that rather than trying to cater to everyone's tastes.",

There are fashion designers whose stuff I wouldn't buy at the top end, but who did a diffusion line for Autograph when it first&#xa0;started, and I have some pieces from that range that I still wear.

Something, somewhere got a little bit lost.</p> <p>I trust Marks &amp; Spencer, but I don't have the sense any more that I will make a real discovery. My fashion advice mainly comes from weekend newspaper supplements, and I don't see a lot of M&amp;S stuff in them.

      "bodyText": "Shareholders at Jupiter Fund Management have delivered one of the biggest protest votes so far this year, with nearly a third registering their opposition to pay arrangements at the fund management group led by Edward Bonham Carter. Investors controlling 42.4% of votes failed to back the pay arrangements for Bonham Carter and his fellow directors. Excluding those who expressed their protest votes by abstaining, 31.5% of votes were cast against remuneration deals for Jupiter directors. The company's lack of support among its own shareholder base for existing pay arrangements is likely to weaken Bonham Carter's campaign against European proposals to cap bonuses for asset managers. Earlier this week. the European parliament approved a plan to cap the bonuses of asset management staff at 100% of salary. \"Can I understand [the bonus cap]? Yes, but that does not mean it's the right move, because excellence should be rewarded,\" Bonham Carter told the Financial Times this month. \"Capping bonuses will result in a rise in fixed salaries, which will lead to a greater number of layoffs when things get rough.\" Jupiter prides itself on having a \u00a3250,000 cap on executive pay, but insists on retaining open-ended bonus opportunities. Most corporate governance groups oppose such measures. This week, it emerged that Tim Breedon, the recently retired chief executive of insurance group Legal &amp; General, received a 2012 pay package of \u00a39.4m. The sum included \u00a35.1m from deferred shares released to him on his retirement after 25 years' service. Breedon, who for several years ran L&amp;G Investment Management, had been regarded as a leading voice \u2013 largely behind the scenes \u2013 seeking to rein in spiralling executive pay. His generous final-year payout comes after he was widely credited with navigating L&amp;G through the financial crisis without the need to go cap in hand to shareholders for additional funds. Several annual meetings take place next week at which remuneration reports will be put to the vote, including at Barclays, which last year faced a rebellion by almost one in three investors over pay deals. The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), which looks after more than \u00a3100bn of pension fund investments, intends to vote against the report and accounts of Barclays to protest about the impact of international financial reporting standards on its accounts. Banks are required to use IFRS accounting but the LAPFF argued that it allowed Barclays to overstate its profits, which in turn allows the bank to overinflate its bonuses. The bank will also publish first quarter profits which are forecast to dip to \u00a31.8bn from \u00a32.4bn a year ago.",
