      "bodyText": "Hedge funds and other financial speculators have made tens of millions of pounds by quietly betting that Carillion would run into financial distress. Short-sellers, who make money by gambling that a company\u2019s share price will fall, have been targeting the company since early 2015, but the number of bets reached a peak just before a profit warning last July that signalled the scale of its problems and sent its shares tumbling. Carillion\u2019s popularity with short-sellers suggests hedge funds were convinced the company was in trouble long before suspicions reached politicians and the public. According to analysis firm IHS Markit, 18 hedge funds made \u00a380m from the initial share slump, with much more likely to have been banked since then, after further steep falls. The biggest winner from July\u2019s share price crash was hedge fund Marshall Wace, whose co-founder Sir Paul Marshall was a major backer of the leave campaign in the Brexit referendum. Another institution that took out big bets on Carillion\u2019s downfall is BlackRock, the US-based investment institution that hired former chancellor George Osborne as an adviser last year, on a \u00a3650,000 salary. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s one of fashion\u2019s best kept secrets, a website where you can buy luxury brands such as Burberry, Prada and Miu Miu as well as the best of the high street for a steal. Sales were up 33% at Christmas as shoppers bagged vintage and designer clothes for the party season but the company is not listed on the stock exchange like the web giant Asos and there is no chance of it ever being taken over. And if you look closely some of the clothes might seem familiar. In fact they might actually be your clothes \u2013 because Oxfam has emerged as an unlikely rising star of the UK\u2019s fast-growing online fashion scene as it casts an increasingly canny eye over the branded cast-offs and vintage styles dumped in bin bags on its shops\u2019 doorsteps every day. \u201cIt is a big secret but when people hear about our website they are really intrigued,\u201d says Oxfam trading director Andrew Horton who wants to double the size of the web operation to reach 10% of retail sales over the next three years. The website is run out of a cavernous warehouse in Batley, West Yorkshire. The building is home to Wastesaver, the charity\u2019s sorting and recycling centre, where every week 50 paid staff sift though 80 tonnes of clothing delivered to its door. \u201cThe shops get donations every day,\u201d explains Horton. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the logistics in place to collect donations they can get clogged up. Some shops only have small stock rooms and we don\u2019t like to turn donations away.\u201d The 80,000 sq ft warehouse, which is a short drive away from web giant Asos\u2019s hub in Barnsley, receives drops of clothing every weekday. The bags are tipped on to conveyor belts which pickers scan for the most saleable items, dropping them into white sacks labelled by category \u201cshoes\u201d, \u201cretro\u201d, \u201cleather\u201d. There is also a second sorting centre in Milton Keynes. The sacks are then passed on to a small team who are surrounded by moodboards created by fashion students which alert them to the latest trends so that they can select them for the online shop. Duster jackets and ponchos are expected to be very big in 2018, along with graphic bags, leather gloves and anything in acid yellow. There are more than 125,000 one-off products listed on the Oxfam website, a vast catalogue that includes books as well as music and clothing. At Christmas the most searched for brands on the website included Barbour, Gucci, Whistles and Boden. At the moment a trawl of Oxfam\u2019s designer boutique turns up a silk Herm\u00e8s scarf, with a \u00a3190 price tag, and a Burberry trench coat for \u00a3110. \u201cI was in Batley to help pack Christmas orders and one was a Karl Lagerfeld jacket from the 80s,\u201d says Horton. \u201cWe always take the view that people who donate want us to try and raise as much money as we can. Generally that\u2019s about a third of the retail cost. The Lagerfeld jacket was \u00a375 and people who like vintage clothing will know that is a good price.\u201d The site\u2019s fashion credentials were boosted by Oxfam\u2019s first catwalk show at London fashion week in 2017 where models paraded the cream of its \u201cpreloved\u201d clothes. The charity is repeating the exercise this year with stylist Bay Garnett currently assembling the collection. In the neighbouring warehouse to Wastesaver a team of volunteers is tasked with giving the clothes the Asos treatment, by photographing them on mannequins and uploading their descriptions on the website. About half of Oxfam\u2019s 620 stores perform this task themselves and the charity is investing in technology to speed up what is a time-consuming process. Some of the desirable items unearthed by Wastesaver staff are sent back to shops that don\u2019t receive enough donations, including branches in Cleveleys, Guisborough and Bury. More outlandish items, and anything screaming fancy dress, are saved for Oxfam\u2019s festival pop-up shops at Glastonbury and Bestival. Just 3% of the clothes sorted in Batley are returned to stores or sold online with the remainder diverted overseas or recycled. The summery stuff in decent nick, plus any old bras, is rolled up into hay-style bales and sold to Frip Ethique, Oxfam\u2019s west African social enterprise. Winter clothes that UK shoppers may dismiss \u2014 such as supermarkets\u2019 own brands which are almost as cheap to buy new \u2014 are packed off to eastern Europe. For clothes that have reached the end of their wearable life the future is shoddy rather than shabby chic. Oxfam sells its leftovers to recycling companies who turn them into the cheap woollen yarn used to make carpet underlay or car seat linings. It was a tough Christmas for the UK retailers but Oxfam recorded like-for-like sales growth of 1.6%. Total sales were up 1.2%, raking in \u00a316.9m in the eight weeks to 23 December. The figures are a drop in the ocean compared with high street giants such as Marks &amp; Spencer but with annual sales on track to exceed \u00a374m this year, Oxfam\u2019s success is measured not by its share price but clean water, with its progress at Christmas enough to help 200,000 people in an emergency. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Carillion crisis: UK government locked in last-ditch rescue talks", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is holding talks with the construction and outsourcing firm Carillion, in a last-ditch attempt to stave off the collapse of a company responsible for crucial services in schools, hospitals and prisons. With the accountancy firm EY lined up to manage an administration that could be triggered as soon as Monday, a rescue deal is expected to hinge on whether the government is willing to help prop up the company. As talks continued on Sunday morning Unite, the UK\u2019s largest trade union, called for a public inquiry into what it called \u201creckless corporate irresponsibility\u201d, including the conduct of directors. Carillion, which is based in Wolverhampton, in the Midlands, and employs 43,000 staff, said it was still hopeful it could map out a future, involving its bank lenders swapping chunks of its \u00a3900m debt for shares. That plan would probably wipe out all existing shareholders. But the banks, headed by HSBC, Barclays and Santander, have yet to agree on a restructuring plan and are understood to be reluctant to pour in new funding unless Downing Street takes part in a bailout. The Cabinet Office is coordinating discussions expected to involve representatives from Carillion, accountants EY and multiple government departments, several of which employ Carillion to provide vital services. The company derives \u00a31.7bn \u2013 about a third of its revenue \u2013 from public sector contracts and public private partnerships. These include providing school dinners, cleaning and catering at NHS hospitals, construction work on rail projects such as HS2 and maintaining 50,000 army base homes for the Ministry of Defence. Carillion is understood to be keen for the government to provide guarantees on some of its public sector contracts to give lenders the confidence to keep backing the company. Unite called for a public inquiry into Carillion\u2019s financial woes, asking why the government continued to hand the company lucrative contracts after three profit warnings. Jim Kennedy, national officer for local government, said: \u201cPublic services, vast amounts of public money, thousands of jobs - including in a lengthy supply chain of insecure agency workers who are also at risk - and workers\u2019 hard-saved pensions are all in danger of being dragged under by yet another bout of reckless corporate irresponsibility. \u201cOnly a full and rapid public inquiry will get to the bottom of this, and set us truly on a course to stop such taxpayer rip-offs happening again. \u201cOf course, the best way to stop the public having to pick up the tab for these repeated private sector failings is to take these contracts back in-house.\u201d Carillion\u2019s share price plunged by a further 29% on Friday and it has now lost 94% of its value in a year, meaning a company once worth \u00a32bn is now valued at \u00a361m. Its value is dwarfed by its \u00a3900m debt pile and its \u00a3580m pension deficit, the latter of which was the subject of discussions on Friday involving the Pensions Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, the government\u2019s lifeboat that ensures retirement payouts continue if a company goes bust. EY has been lined up to manage an administration that could be triggered as soon as Monday if no rescue plan for Carillion can be agreed at discussions on Sunday. That would effectively put EY in charge of Carillion\u2019s government contracts until buyers can be found for chunks of the company. The government has said it has contingency plans to handle the contracts if Carillion goes under. The Cabinet Office declined to comment on the rescue talks. Controversial contracts The government has come in for criticism for continuing to award a string of major contracts to Carillion despite its repeated profit warnings. Here is a list of the deals. 10 July 2017 \u2013 first profit warning Carillion downgrades its profit forecasts after taking an \u00a3845m hit on the value of contracts. Chief executive Richard Howson quits and its shares fall 39%. 17 July - contract award The government awards \u00a31.4bn of HS2 contracts to a joint venture including Carillion. 18 July - contract award Ministry of Defence hands Carillion a \u00a3158m contract to manage services such as catering and accommodation at 233 military facilities. 29 September - second profit warning Carillion issues a fresh profit warning after unveiling a half-year loss of \u00a31.15bn, which it calls a \u201cdisappointing set of results\u201d. 6 November - contract award Network Rail awards Carillion \u00a362m contract to electrify the London-to-Corby rail line. 17 November - third profit warning Carillion says it is seeking an easing of the terms of its debts, after problems with key contracts forced it to downgrade profit forecasts again. 20 November - contract award The government\u2019s Education and Skills Funding Agency awards \u00a312m in schools building contracts to Carillion, despite what the interim chief executive, Keith Cochrane, calls the group\u2019s \u201ccurrent challenges\u201d. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Detroit in winter has never been an easy sell, but for generations of car lovers Motor City has been the only place to be come January, when America\u2019s largest car show kicks into gear. In recent years, as tech has moved ever more aggressively into the automobile industry, the annual North American International Auto Show has been overshadowed by the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) \u2013 an industry trade show held this week in Las Vegas. But as Detroit\u2019s auto giants increasingly take the fight to Silicon Valley, analysts say its premier auto show is here to stay. \u201cThe narrative about Detroit dying is an easy one, but it\u2019s not dying, it\u2019s changing,\u201d Stephanie Brinley, a senior analyst at IHS Markit, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Detroit \u2013 other auto shows are facing the same issues \u2013 but I don\u2019t think auto shows are going anywhere. They\u2019re changing and they continue to evolve.\u201d CES has become an important venue for automakers to showcase technological advances. But Brinley said CES was a trade show aimed at industry insiders while Detroit, a public show, opened its doors to consumers. More than 800,000 people attended last year for a chance to kick the tires of products that will be available this year and the show pumped an estimated $450m into the local economy. \u201cThey are really two different shows \u2013 one is a trade show with a consumer element while the other is a consumer show with a trade element,\u201d Matt DeLorenzo, an editor at Kelley Blue Book, said. \u201cCES will win on advanced technology, but not necessarily on products that the consumer can buy.\u201d Most of the auto industry news out of CES was big-picture \u2013 from Ford\u2019s announcement that it would partner with a Silicon Valley startup to boost its autonomous vehicle programme to Toyota\u2019s announcement that it would soon offer Amazon\u2019s digital assistant Alexa in its vehicles. Detroit will have more than its fair share of tech (hometown star General Motors, not Tesla or Google, will be the first to launch a self-driving production vehicle with no steering wheel) but the big reveals are likely to be new trucks, a new Chevrolet Silverado and a Chrysler Ram 1500, and cars that people will actually buy, this year. Muncey said that, per last year\u2019s numbers, NAIAS still fared well among auto-related shows, ranking third in the world behind Shanghai (which is focused upon the world\u2019s largest automotive market) and Geneva. In an effort to avoid being drowned out by CES buzz, organizers of the Detroit show began hosting a tech-focused component last year called AutoMobili-D. Max Muncey, the public relations manager for NAIAS, said AutoMobili-D, which will include a kick-off keynote speech by US transportation secretary Elaine Chao, has been expanded this year to cover a 150,000 sq ft chunk of a million-square-foot show. DeLorenzo, who looked askance at AutoMobili-D, said that it was important to distinguish the shows from the industry. The new tech focus was, he said, a distraction from what Detroit does best \u2013 cars and trucks. \u201cAuto shows in general should stick to their knitting, and be more about cars you can buy rather than speculative tech,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Detroit will be remembered this year for any advances or big announcements on the autonomous front, and I can\u2019t think of any earth-shattering news coming out of CES, for that matter.\u201d Both Muncey and Brinley said that Detroit still stood as an important global auto manufacturing hub \u2013 one that will maintain its role as an influencer. As to the perceived push-pull over automotive tech between Detroit and Silicon Valley, DeLorenzo viewed it as more of a symbiotic relationship. \u201cSilicon Valley needs Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the autonomous technology is worth nothing if it doesn\u2019t have a vehicle to pilot around. Detroit builds vehicles, hence, Silicon Valley needs Detroit more than Detroit needs Silicon Valley.\u201d While autonomy and artificial intelligence continue to dazzle and inspire visions of a hi-tech future, in chilly, snow-swept Detroit today\u2019s reality will be on display.",

      "bodyText": "Life is tough for high street retailers and likely to get worse in 2018. That\u2019s the clear message following a difficult Christmas for most shopping chains and signals from the banks that they aim to bring a three-year bonanza of cheap consumer credit to an end, or at least severely restrict its further growth. Supermarkets were among the survivors as shoppers chose to spend a few extra pounds on food to cope with inflation. But that meant cutbacks elsewhere. Clothing, shoes and furniture joined a list of items shoppers decided they could do without \u2013 or, if they needed them, they went online for a cheap deal. Next was among the retailers to enjoy a degree of expansion after it was rescued by healthy online sales. Marks &amp; Spencer struggled to make any headway after its failure to entice customers to its website. If the health of the high street depends on anyone, it is the big discounters like Aldi and Lidl in the supermarket wars and B&amp;M, which is the Primark of food shops, selling household brands such as Kellogg\u2019s and Walkers at knock-down prices. But few high streets can survive with just discount shops to add to a smattering of charity outlets, bookies and pawnbrokers. Most towns vie with their neighbours to have at least one department store on their high street or, failing that, some national chains. Not so long ago, when Debenhams seemed like it would be turning up in almost every corner of the country with a new store, this dream appeared to be coming true. John Lewis was another department store that was talked about as a candidate for aiding urban renewal in the unlikeliest of places. The rapid expansion of chains such as New Look, TK Maxx and, more recently, jeweller Pandora has helped keep many smaller centres from looking down at heel. Sadly, Debenhams had a disastrous Christmas, as did House of Fraser, and both have ditched any expansion plans left over from the 2015 boom times. Cutbacks are the order of the day. M&amp;S is already closing stores, mostly in towns that shoppers have long since started driving past. New Look has seen sales fall, while profits at TK Maxx and Pandora are down. John Lewis is doing well although, like Next, all the improvement is online, not in its stores. Soon, even more high streets outside the big cities and successful market towns will have a ghostly pallor. At the root of the problem is the decline in disposable incomes. With inflation at around 3% and wage rises averaging 2.2%, households are struggling to maintain their standard of living. In a post-EU referendum economy, with uncertainty forcing companies to delay investment, average wages don\u2019t look like rising strongly any time soon. There was more bad news in the latest Bank of England study of consumer lending. A survey of high street banks found they were planning to severely restrict the generosity displayed in recent years that has pushed unsecured lending up by around 10% a year. Credit-card balances will be cut back and the length of interest-free periods will be reduced. Cheap loans will be limited to only the safest borrowers. This move is a response to concerns that the major banks had begun to lend recklessly, repeating the mistakes that led to the 2008 banking crash. There can be no doubt that some harsh words are welcome from the financial regulator decrying bonus-chasing bankers offering loans to every Tom, Jane and Harriet. However, they are not so welcome if you are a shop owner or worker who depends on consumers maintaining their shopping habits. MPs have largely ignored the subject of healthy town centres, leaving the problem to local authorities. Maybe if more of them shopped in their constituencies, they might notice the changes going on. It is possible that after another tough year, and some more shop closures, they might want the government to start thinking about giving the worst-affected towns a fresh start. Even if bonds fall, it\u2019s hard to see an end to this era of cheap credit There are some economic laws that reassert themselves, and some that are victims of changing times. The likely path of borrowing costs \u2013 that they rise in good times and fall in bad \u2013 is one such law that has failed to conform to previous trends. For 30 years now, interest rates have been falling, making it cheaper and cheaper to borrow money. This trend has continued during booms and busts on global stock markets, to which the debt markets were previously tied. The 2008 crash accelerated the decline in rates, but it was already well under way. Today, central banks charge commercial lenders an almost zero rate of interest, allowing mortgage lenders to push loan rates down to historic lows. Even the five increases in the US Federal Reserve\u2019s base rates since 2015 have done nothing to alter the downward trend. US lenders, keen to win business, have squeezed their margins rather than pass on the higher cost of borrowing from the Fed. But there are several debt-market gurus who think the latest signals from the European Central Bank and the central banks of Japan and China could mark an end to this era of cheap credit. The price of buying bonds, which is the market\u2019s way of packaging up the debt issued by governments and companies \u2013 state and corporate borrowing, in other words \u2013 is falling. The interest rate \u2013 referred to as the \u201cyield\u201d \u2013 on bonds rises as the price falls, and last week the yield on a 10-year US government bond jumped to nearly 2.6%, its highest level for almost a year. If, as is being signalled, the central banks of China, Japan and the eurozone start cutting back on their purchases of bonds, then, the argument runs, overall demand will fall and so will the price: and such borrowing will become more expensive. But even if central banks end their role as major bond purchasers, there is still plenty of demand. The world\u2019s financial system is awash with money looking for a home. Bonds remain a popular choice \u2013 cushioning any potential fall in price and rise in yield. Big brains of business enjoy curling up with a good book On both sides of the Atlantic, book clubs have strong associations with entertainment stars: Oprah Winfrey in the US, for example, and Richard and Judy in the UK. But now there is a new genre of literary cheerleader: the corporate bibliophile. Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates both publish reading lists and encourage readers to follow suit. Among the titles recommended by both tycoons are Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s Sapiens and The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker. The Gates and Zuckerberg lists have won approval from cultural peers, including the managing director of Waterstones, but there has been justified criticism of the apparent gender imbalance in their reading. Books by men appear to outweigh those by women. Hopefully, the Facebook and Microsoft founders will adjust their bedtime reading piles accordingly. That aside, it is surely a good thing that two of the world\u2019s most powerful corporate figures are advocating the attainment of written wisdom. Their peers should take note. Literally.",

      "bodyText": "Everybody seems to be talking about breakups at Whitbread, the group that owns the likes of Costa Coffee, Premier Inn and Brewers Fayre. Take these three recent headlines, for example: \u201cFurious wife confronts her \u2018cheating\u2019 husband and \u2018his mistress\u2019 at a seaside Premier Inn,\u201d said Mail Online last Tuesday. A day later and the Sun screamed: \u201cFromage a Trois,\u201d as it informed us about two chefs and a waitress at Brewers Fayre getting themselves entangled in a love triangle (and a potential knife fight). And, finally: \u201cTime to revisit those Whitbread breakup models,\u201d from the Financial Times, during a breathless spell of reports from last month. Still, as Whitbread prepares to face investors for its trading update this week, the City\u2019s number crunchers will be concentrating less on the tabloid coverage, and more on whether the FT is correct and the company itself feels it is finally the time for a split. Last month, Sachem Head Capital Management, a New York activist investor, revealed it had a 3.4% stake in the leisure group, which merely added to the already long-running speculation that the firm might spin off Costa or sell its pubs business. Alison Brittain, Whitbread\u2019s chief executive, says the group is \u201cenormously open-minded\u201d about its structure. Developing ... The upside of Man U\u2019s poor form Astonishing as it may seem, not everybody despises Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the Manchester United manager. Take Philip Bowcock, the chief executive of bookmaker William Hill, who must feel rather fond of the cantankerous old Portuguese at the moment. The bookmaker had been suffering from a rather dodgy spell of form over the past few years, but its fortunes may be about to improve \u2013 with a small contribution from the Special One. Just before Christmas, Man U went on its own questionable run, and surprise draws against Leicester City, Burnley and Southampton \u2013 plus a League Cup defeat to Bristol City \u2013 look likely to have swelled bookmakers\u2019 coffers slightly. This is timely, as William Hill is preparing for a trading statement this week. Analysts at Canaccord muse: \u201cThere are enough glimmers of light to suggest sunnier prospects for [William Hill\u2019s] long-suffering shareholders. First, and least, a favourable run of sporting results over Christmas ... points to scope for a modestly positive surprise in FY17. There have also been signs of recuperation in the online business following a period of heavy medicine.\u201d Happy days (possibly). Cheap remark haunts Burberry A year ago Christopher Baileycorrect, then chief executive of Burberry and still the luxury brand\u2019s creative director, was banging on about how he was looking forward to a \u201cwonderfully collaborative relationship\u201d with Marco Gobbetti. Gobbetti arrived in July last year to relieve Bailey of the chief exec gig but, by October, it was apparent that the collaboration was not wonderful enough to keep the pairing together: Bailey will step down as president and creative director in March \u2013 and will be out of the company entirely by the end of this year, following 17 years at the fashion house. Gobbetti hasn\u2019t waited long to leave other marks, too. Most memorable so far was his November announcement signalling that a company selling rain macs at more than \u00a31,500 a pop was a bit on the cheap side, so the Italian planned to take Burberry, er, upmarket. The shares did the opposite, however, and have yet to really recover. Which brings us to this week and Burberry\u2019s trading statement, when Barclays predicts the firm will post a 3% rise in third-quarter like-for-like sales. Still, questions might be asked about Gobbetti\u2019s plans to fill the gaps left by Bailey, plus the \u00a3850m that got knocked off the company\u2019s value following his upmarket comment. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

There have also been signs of recuperation in the online business following a period of heavy medicine.\u201d Happy days (possibly).</p> <h2>Cheap remark haunts Burberry</h2> <p>A year ago <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/11/burberrys-christopher-bailey-new-ceo-celine-marco-gobbetti\">Christopher Bailey</a>correct, then chief executive of Burberry and still the luxury brand\u2019s creative director, was banging on about how he was looking forward to a \u201cwonderfully collaborative relationship\u201d with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/marco-gobbetti-the-man-tasked-with-putting-burberry-back-in-fashion\">Marco Gobbetti</a>.</p> <p>Gobbetti arrived in July last year to relieve Bailey of the chief exec gig but, by October, it was apparent that the collaboration was not wonderful enough to keep the pairing together: Bailey will step down as president and creative director in March \u2013 and will be out of the company entirely by the end of this year, following 17 years at the fashion house.</p> <p>Gobbetti hasn\u2019t waited long to leave other marks, too. Most memorable so far was his November announcement signalling that a company selling rain macs at more than \u00a31,500 a pop was a bit on the cheap side, so the Italian planned to take Burberry, er, upmarket. The shares did the opposite, however, and have yet to really recover.</p> <p>Which brings us to this week and Burberry\u2019s trading statement, when Barclays predicts the firm will post a 3% rise in third-quarter like-for-like sales. Still, questions might be asked about Gobbetti\u2019s plans to fill the gaps left by Bailey, plus the \u00a3850m that got knocked off the company\u2019s value following his upmarket comment.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the many annoying aspects of the Brexit referendum fiasco is that it has diverted attention from so many pressing domestic economic and social problems. Yet those of us who are unrepentant Remainers still regard the struggle as worthwhile. Brexiters may argue that the prospect of short-term economic damage was exaggerated during the campaign, and, as I acknowledged in a recent column, it was. But that this is a case of \u201cso far, not so bad\u201d is beside the point. The damage will hit us if we go ahead with leaving our largest market and indulge the extreme Brexiters\u2019 fantasy of contriving wonderful new markets in far less important countries from the trading point of view \u2013 markets, that, strangely enough, already exist. A point made by a number of us to older Brexiters was, and still is, that they were not being too mindful of the interests of their children and grandchildren, who have grown up with the freedom to travel, work and study throughout the European Union and now see all this threatened. But it is becoming more and more obvious that the younger generation are threatened not only by the prospect of Brexit \u2013 and I repeat, to the BBC and others: it hasn\u2019t happened yet! \u2013 but by an accumulation of economic problems, epitomised by the depleted condition of so many public services. And not only the younger generation. It seems to be widely accepted that the referendum result was to a considerable extent a protest vote against the economic and social problems \u2013 housing, the health service, social care, transport, you name it \u2013 that have resulted from neglect by successive governments, and were undoubtedly aggravated by the banking crisis and post-crisis austerity. Now, among my older friends who are concerned about the state of the nation now, and the prospects for young and old alike, is the Cambridge economist Robert Neild, who, at the age of 93, is as sharp as ever. Robert was chief economic adviser to the Treasury in the 1960s \u2013 repeat, the 1960s \u2013 and has seen a thing or two. In a recent paper he has argued forcefully that many of this country\u2019s problems with public services stem from the simple fact that those services are woefully underfunded. Thus the \u201ctax take\u201d in this country amounts to 35% of gross domestic product, whereas the average in the European Union I still hope we won\u2019t leave is 40%. He points out that, since public spending amounts to a third of GDP, an increase in the tax take here to the European average would finance a 14% increase in public spending, and provide the wherewithal to answer all those critics whose standard response to any suggestion of higher public spending is \u201cwhere is the money coming from?\u201d. At which point I cannot resist noting that a prominent Conservative Brexiter once admitted to me that he particularly likes France because of the health service. Which brings us to the present outcries about the state of the NHS. This is, as usual, against the background of the prevailing view in this country that we should have Scandinavian levels of public service while enjoying US levels of taxation \u2013 or, in the extreme rightwing Brexiters\u2019 case, Singaporean levels of taxation. The scale of the resistance to \u201ctax and spend\u201d in Britain was manifested when Gordon Brown, as chancellor, made Herculean efforts to prepare the nation for a 1% increase in employer and employee national insurance contributions in an effort to bring the health service up to continental standards. Evidently, there is some way to go. More and more people, such as the admirable anti-Brexit campaigner Lord Adonis, are evoking the spirit of the Attlee postwar government to address the current crisis. It is a formidable task \u2013 as indeed it was for Attlee, who met dreadful opposition at the time, even though he has been sanctified by modern historians. When it comes to the rightwing press, there is nothing new under the sun. The current social crisis and prospect would be less daunting if Brexit were not piled on top of it. In which context I could hardly believe my ears last week when Chancellor Hammond was quoted as telling our fellow Europeans that it made no sense to put in place \u201cunnecessary barriers\u201d to British demands. All the \u201cunnecessary barriers\u201d have been put in place by Britain\u2019s bizarre decision to leave the EU. There is also a prevailing view that the government is involved in some kind of \u201cnegotiation\u201d. I fear that this constitutes a gross misunderstanding of the situation. When, after realising that membership of the European Free Trade Area was unsatisfactory, successive British governments applied for, and eventually succeeded in obtaining, membership of what is now the European Union, we had to negotiate terms of membership. Now, if this narrow and ill-informed referendum decision is not reversed, we have to leave the club. When you leave a club, there is nothing to negotiate: you pay what you owe and you leave. Better to Remain! Moreover, it is not as if our European counterparts did not have enough on their plates already. Our fellow Europeans can be forgiven for asking what planet the British think they are on.",
