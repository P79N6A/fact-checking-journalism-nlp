The British and Irish governments, food watchdogs and companies involved began a pan-European investigation of supply chains for beefburger products found to contain equine and porcine DNA. David Cameron told MPs the contamination, originally revealed by Irish authorities on Tuesday, was \"a completely unacceptable state of affairs\". Pointing the finger at supermarkets, he said that although investigations were now looking at the supply chains, \"it is worth making the point that ultimately retailers have to be responsible for what they sell and where it has come from\".

The agency added that it would work with devolved rural affairs departments and local authorities on a nationwide study of \"food authenticity\" in processed meat products, but it gave no details. Some companies took beef not implicated in the tests by Irish authorities off the shelves as a precaution as the meat industry sought to avert a consumer backlash such as those caused by BSE during the 1990s and the dioxin contamination of Irish pork in 2008. Although neither supermarket was implicated in the tests, Asda withdrew nine burger lines while it carried out checks on suppliers and Sainsbury's withdrew one line from sale. On Tuesday, the Irish investigation by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) found that Tesco, Lidl, Aldi and Iceland stocked beefburger lines contaminated by DNA from horses, although not all were sold in stores in England, Wales and Scotland.

The demise of Blockbuster's UK arm, which began in 1989 with a single shop on Walworth Road in south-east London, comes after the collapse of the music store HMV and camera specialist Jessops, and adds 4,190 workers to those who face losing their jobs. Blockbuster will remain open while its administrator looks for buyers, but its 528 outlets are among an estimated 1,400 shops that face closure. As consumer anger mounts over HMV's decision not to allow customers to redeem gift vouchers sold over Christmas, Blockbuster has promised to honour gift cards and credit acquired through its trade-in scheme, where movies, games and consoles can be exchanged for future purchases. Without the expense of running stores, online rivals such as Amazon, Netflix and Lovefilm have eaten into Blockbuster's profits by sending films through the post.

Ever since TUI AG decided in 2008 to shift its focus away from shipping and sell a majority stake in Hapag-Lloyd, its shareholders have been considering ideas of how to combine with TUI Travel to cut costs and pool resources. Both groups currently have their own headquarters - in Hanover, Germany, and London respectively - although estimates on the potential savings a merger might yield vary wildly from more than \u20ac500m (\u00a3414m) to \u20ac100m.",

In a trading update on Wednesday Barratt Developments said pre-tax profits in the first six months should more than double to \u00a345m. Contrast this with 2008 when the company almost went bust. Back then Barratt, which accumulated huge debts at the height of the boom buying rival developers, was effectively in the hands of its banks. But through the goodwill and economic sense of the taxpayer, via Gordon Brown's office in the Treasury, Barratt was saved. The government told the banks to lay off indebted businesses, especially property firms (to save the housing market). It also came up with a \u00a31bn lending scheme and grants for the building industry. So like Barclays and HSBC, which always trot out their bogus boast about surviving the crash without a government bailout, Barratt is only still with us because the government saved it. It wasn't the only one. Hundreds of building firms eased their way back to health with government cash (and some stuffed the bank accounts of their bosses, but that's another story). Analysts say Barratt has improved profit margins by building on cheap land bought after the financial crisis. But much of this land was already on its books. What the company did was to simply write down the value, such that when it came to time to build, it could book enormous profits. Barrett's operating margins are expected to increase to 8.4%, from 6.4% last year, effectively placing a charge on home buyers, many of whom were party, through the government, to saving the business in the first place. In 2010, Barratt's boss Mark Clare rewarded himself handsomely, collecting \u00a31.42m. Last year this figure had jumped to \u00a31.6m. The banks are doing the same, namely rescuing their old business models and executive bonuses with profits built on taxpayer support and overcharging customers. It seems governments of all colours believe the only way to kickstart the economy is to allow the institutions that made most of the profits in the boom \u2013 the banks and property developers \u2013 to get back on their feet with free money from the taxpayer so they can rip off their customers again. Shareholders are the only winners. It's the same old problem and probably means another property/banking crash is coming down the track sooner than we think.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "That's the lot for today. Here's a quick closing summary \u2022 Finland's prime minister has weighed in on the question of Britain's future in Europe. Jyrki Katainen said an EU without the UK just wasn't the same, like 'fish without chips' (see 12.40pm onwards). \u2022 The World Bank has slashed its economic forecasts. It now expects the eurozone to contract this year, and is also worried about the US budget negotiations (see 8.43am) \u2022 European car sales also fell again - down by over 16% year-on-year in December (see 9.00am). \u2022 Austria's central bank governor, though, was confident that the worst of the crisis was over (see 11.09am). \u2022 The Greek parliament prepared to vote on whether to probe several senior politicians, as its tax evasion scandal continues (see 5.31pm) \u2022 And the Bundesbank confirmed plans to move some of its gold reserves home (see 2.38pm). Thanks for reading, and to those who commented. Goodnight! Much ado in Athens, reports our correspondent Helena Smith, where parliament is preparing to hold a crucial vote on whether to launch a criminal investigation against two former prime ministers and a pair of ex finance ministers for their handling of suspected tax offenders in the so-called Lagarde list. Helena writes: After spending much of the day debating the logistics of how the vote will be conducted, the Greek parliament is expected to hold the ballot tomorrow. Widely seen as a landmark event in the campaign to bring catharsis to a political establishment whose corrupt goings-on are perceived as the root of Greece\u2019s ills, it takes place in an atmosphere that is both febrile and tense. \u201cThe mood today was extremely explosive and we haven\u2019t even got to the vote yet,\u201d said one MP in the 300-seat House. Lawmakers will decide whether to launch a parliamentary investigation against two former prime ministers \u2013 the socialist George Papandreou and the former vice president of the European Central Bank Lucas Papademos \u2013 following a proposal by the nationalist Independent Greeks party to probe the erstwhile leaders for breach of duty in pursuing suspected tax evaders named on the notorious list. Two ex finance ministers - George Papaconstantinou and Evangelos Venizelos, who as head of the Socialist Pasok party is a leader in the tri-partite coalition - will also be the focus of the ballot although almost nobody believes that anyone but Papaconstantinou will actually end up being probed. \u201cWhat we are going to see is a lot of parliamentary games because the whole thing is a set up,\u201d the spokesman of the main opposition Syriza party, Panos Skourletis, told me this afternoon. \u201cThe long and short is that this list went unused for 17 months which in itself is criminal when other countries in the euro zone were pursuing tax evaders.\u201d With the government commanding 169 seats in the House, Skourletis said he did not expect the parliament to endorse Syriza\u2019s proposal that Venizelos also face criminal prosecution for failing to utilize the list, first handed by the then Frenhc finance minister Christine Lagarde to Papaconstantinou in late 2010. \u201cPeople want to see punishment [meted out] but ultimately it is Papaconstantinou who is likely to take the brunt,\u201d he added. Meanwhile, says Helena... , the Independent Greeks party has announced that it will sue the troika \u2013 the EU, ECB and IMF \u2013 propping up the debt-stricken Greek economy for \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d claiming that the onerous terms demanded in return for rescue funds has been the trigger for thousands of suicides since the eruption of the crisis three years ago. The government has, so far, refused to comment. Greece\u2019s creditors are lining up to disburse more aid \u2013 around \u20ac9.2 bn - by the end of the month. The new cash installment is expected to be agreed at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers on Monday, according to Yiannis Stournaras Athens' finance minister, who last night said on Greek TV that he did not rule out a second restructuring of the country\u2019s staggering debt pile. Europe's stock markets have closed, after a pretty undramatic day. FTSE 100: down 13 points at 6103, -0.22% German DAX: up 14 points at 7690, +0.2% French CAC: up 11 points at 3708, +0.3% Spanish IBEX: down 19 points at 8581, - 0.23% Italian FTSE MIB: down 127 points at 17339, -0.7% Michael Hewson of CMC Markets is surprised there wasn't more of a sell-off: We\u2019ve seen a bit of a softer tone in equity markets today after the World Bank adjusted its growth forecasts downward for 2013. The German finance ministry also downgraded its growth forecast for 2013 to 0.4%, but this has merely brought it into line with the Bundesbank projection of last month. We\u2019ve also seen a very disappointing report on new car sales in Europe which dropped again by 16.3% in December to their lowest levels since 1995. Given the news flow today it\u2019s hard to fathom why markets aren\u2019t lower than they are, given the continued stream of bad news from the retail sector. Following on from the administration of Jessops and HMV we\u2019ve seen DVD chain Blockbuster follow suit today as it succumbs to competition from the more agile business models of internet rivals, Netflix, LoveFilm and Apple TV. Also out today we\u2019ve seen disappointing numbers from French Connection with the likelihood that tomorrow we could well also see a disappointing update from last year\u2019s retail outperformer Dixons. America continues to churn out economic data that would be most welcome in the eurozone. This afternoon it was industrial output, which rose by 0.3% in December, following a 1.0% gain in November. That means industrial output rose by 1%, at an annualised rate, in the last three months of 2012. In contrast the eurozone's industrial output fell by 0.3% in November, and isn't expected to have bounced back. Capital Economics pointed out that the underlying picture in America was better than the headline number: The 0.3% month-on-month gain in industrial production is a lot better than it looks because the unseasonably warm weather last month led to a 4.8% m/m drop in utilities output, which subtracted nearly 0.5% from overall production. Manufacturing output actually increased by a robust 0.8% m/m. Europe's plans for banking union are coming unstuck before they're even agreed, according to the Wall Street Journal this afternoon. The WSJ reports that some EU members are getting cold feet about the idea of recapitalising struggling banks directly \u2013 reckoning it could be better to make loans to their national governments first. That, though, would not achieve the aim of breaking the 'vicious link' between the banks and the sovereigns. The Journal also warns that some northern countries are still adamant that legacy bad debts should not be eligible - meaning banking union would not really clean up the sector. Here's the story: Euro-Zone Bank Plan Could Get Watered Down And here's a flavour: One of the euro zone's most significant commitments last year aimed at containing its financial crisis\u2014a plan to allow the bloc's bailout fund to directly boost the capital of banks in countries facing debt troubles\u2014could be undermined by technical complications and second thoughts by some governments. In meetings this week, the head of the bloc's bailout fund told senior finance ministry officials that allowing the fund to directly recapitalize banks would deplete its lending capacity much faster than extending loans to governments, the fund's usual role, two euro-zone officials said. Rich countries, including Germany, meanwhile, insisted that governments should remain responsible for at least some of the direct aid to their banks, potentially leaving them saddled with losses. Public opposition to the Greek government's reform measures were on show today, despite some rather wet weather. Workers from the Hellenic Postbank held a protest march in Athens against the bank's privatisation, which could lead to job losses and branch closures. The sale is part of Greece's state asset sale plan. Over in Greece the radical left main opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras has met the country\u2019s head of state this morning amid mounting fears of a major terrorist attack following the recent wave of violence. Our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reports: The eurozone crisis was meant to be high on the agenda when the radical left leader met Greece\u2019s president, Karolos Papoulias, to brief him about his recent trip to Germany and tour of Latin America in the run-up to Christmas. Tsipras, who is on a mission to boost his Syriza party\u2019s credibility abroad \u2013 next week he flies to the US \u2013 told Papoulias it was clear from his talks with German officials, including finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, that Greece had failed to fully negotiate with its European partners when it signed up to the Mnimomio, or Memorandum, outlining the terms of Athens\u2019 bailout from the EU and IMF. As an example Tsipras took the case of the occupation loan Greece had been forced to give Germany when it was taken over by Nazi forces during the second world war. But even more then the eurozone it was the recent violence that has gripped Greece that dominated the talks. Tsipras, who meets the US ambassador this afternoon, expressed fears over the attacks - which has seen the homes of government officials and journalists being firebombed in the last week \u2013 describing the \u201cstrategy of tension\u201d that appeared to be building up as especially \u201cdangerous\u201d. Helena continues: Tensions between Syriza and Athens\u2019 fragile coalition have been on the rise following the accusation of leading party cadres that the attacks may have been executed by \u201cpara-state\u201d officials in a bid to divert attention from unpopular EU-IMF dictated austerity measures. The government has blamed the violence, squarely, on forces of the anti-austerity left with counter-terrorism officials saying at least three people, including a woman, were involved in a gun attack on the central offices of the ruling New Democracy party early Monday. The public order minister, Nikos Dendias, went so far as to warn of a \u201cmajor attack\u201d when he briefed the governing coalition\u2019s party leaders about the violence during a crisis meeting of the politicians late on Monday. Fotis Kouvellis, who leads the tri-partite alliance\u2019s Democratic Left party, emerged from the talks saying it was imperative the government took steps to reinforce a protective social network \u201cgiven that unemployment is at very high levels [and] is a threat to social cohesion\". The Bundesbank has announced today that it will move a significant chunk of its gold reserves - around 674 tonnes of the stuff - back to Germany. The plan will see Germany empty its section of the vaults at the Banque de Paris, where 374 tonnes of ingots currently sit gathering dust. Another 300 tonnes will be recovered from the Federal Reserve. This is the official explanation: The withdrawal of the reserves from the storage location in Paris reflects the change in the framework conditions since the introduction of the euro. Given that France, like Germany, also has the euro as its national currency, the Bundesbank is no longer dependent on Paris as a financial centre in which to exchange gold for an international reserve currency should the need arise. As capacity has now become available in the Bundesbank\u2019s own vaults in Germany, the gold stocks can now be relocated from Paris to Frankfurt. Unofficially, the end of the Cold War means that Germany now sees no need to keep its treasure well away from Russia. There's also an argument that Berlin wants its gold close to hand in case the financial crisis flares up again (The Telegraph's Ambrose Evans-Pritchard has dubbed it a watershed moment). The real conspiracy theory is that the gold doesn't even exist at all. Anyway, the operation will last seven years, and here's the plan: Frankfurt: holds 31% of Germany's gold today, rising to 50% in 2020 New York: 45% today, 37% by 2020 London: 13% today, 13% in 2020 Paris: 11% today, none by 2020 And you can read the full briefing from the Bundesbank, in German, here (pdf). Jyrki Katainen's suggestion that the European Union without Britain would be like fish without chips has prompted some banter online, with both europhiles and eurosceptics (and those on the eurofence) getting stuck in: Finnish PM Jyrki Katainen also queried whether David Cameron had much chance of repatriating powers from Brussels, as the UK PM hopes. Katainen said: Being a member of the EU and especially in the single market you cannot kind of pick the raisins out of the bun. It\u2019s very difficult to say what would be the competences that could be repatriated. I don\u2019t know exactly what they could be, and when looking at Britain and its role in Europe and in the world, it has benefited a lot from an integrated Europe. That's via the FT's Peter Spiegel, who also attended today's chat with Katainen, and has just posted the best quotes: Some great quotes from the Finnish prime minister just flashed up. Jyrki Katainen has declared that a European Union without Britain would be like \"fish without chips\". In an interview with Reuters several journalists in Brussels, Katainen said he believed that most \"major\" UK politicians and members of the public want Britain to remain at the heart of Europe. Katainen said (hat-tip Reuters): The European Union without Britain is pretty much the same as fish without chips. It's not a meal anymore. The issue was raised at prime minister's questions at midday, where David Cameron defended his plan to seek a new deal between the UK and Europe. However, the PM also ruled out an in/out referendum anytime soon. Political commentator Gaby Hinsliff reckons the issue of Europe will dominate UK politics for years.... Another eurozone credit rating downgrade - Standard &amp; Poor's has just announced that it has downgraded Malta's rating by one notch to BBB+, from A-, with a stable outlook. That leaves the country just three notches above Junk. UPDATE: Here's S&amp;P's reasoning: The dissolution of Malta's parliament on January 7, 2013, will prevent a 2013 budget from being adopted until after the elections set for March 9, thus raising questions about the government's ability to restore the fiscal flexibility it has gradually lost, and resolving the recurrent budgetary risks caused by loss-making state-owned enterprises. Gross general government debt has risen to just above 75% of GDP, and could continue to increase on the back of weaker-than-projected growth or stock-flow adjustments... The outlook on the long-term rating is stable, reflecting our view of Malta's relative resilience to the ongoing political, financial, and monetary challenges in the eurozone. Germany's economics ministry has also publicly urged the European Central Bank to return to standard monetary policy as swiftly as possible. Here's the key section (thanks to Reuters for the translation) in this morning's annual report (see also 11.27am): Monetary value must be stable for prices to be able to fulfill their signalling function. That's why the European Central Bank has a clear mandate: the ultimate goal of monetary policy is to ensure price stability. It is therefore crucial for the ECB to return to its normal mode of monetary policy as quickly as possible. Hmmm. The ECB could point out that inflation remains steady at 2.2% (see 10.28am), suggesting that price stability has not been unduly undermined. Economy minister Philipp R\u00f6sler also rebuffed the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, for suggesting that German should launch new stimulus measures. R\u00f6sler told a press conference in Berlin that his government could not support 'debt financed' stimulus packages. It's official, the German government has slashed its growth forecasts for this year, blaming the impact of the eurocrisis on its trading partners. The economy ministry announced that German GDP will grow by just 0.4% in 2013, down from its previous forecast of 1%. It still expects a bounceback in 2014, though, with GDP growth of 1.6%. The revisions were expected following yesterday's news that the German economy shrank, by around 0.5%, in the last quarter. With the World Bank also slashing its forecasts for 2013 (see 8.43am), the consensus is clear - 2013 is going to be a dog of a year. But once again, economists see better times over the horizon..... The Austrian central bank governor, Ewald Nowotny, provides today's slice of eurozone optimism, telling reporters in Vienna that the worst is behind us. Speaking at a Euromoney conference, he told Reuters that: I am quite sure that the panic situation, if there ever had been one, is over. We are in a clearly much more stable surrounding now. There is no reason to be careless, but there is a reason for cautious optimism. Remarkable insouciance in Nowotny's first line - as if there might not have been all that much to worry about last year..... Anyway, he also disputed Jean-Claude Juncker's claim that the euro was now too highly valued (see 10.16am), saying the euro's rally was \"not a matter of major concern\". And he, unlike Juncker, has a hand in setting eurozone interest rates... Inflation within the eurozone was unchanged last month at 2.2%, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index. That, Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight says, means the European Central Bank could cut rates in the months ahead: There is nothing alarming in the December Eurozone inflation data and underlying inflationary pressures seemingly remain muted amid extended weakened economic activity and high and rising unemployment. Consequently, it still seems likely that Eurozone consumer price inflation will move below 2.0% over the coming months. This will help consumers\u2019 purchasing power and gives the ECB scope to cut interest rates. Jean-Claude Juncker, outgoing head of the Eurogroup, has managed to talk the euro down by warning last night that the single currency was now \"dangerously high\" in the currency markets. Juncker's warning has knocked the euro down to $1.327 v the dollar, from nearly $1.34 yesterday. Speaking to business leaders in Luxembourg, Juncker said the recent euro rally (up from just $1.20 last July) was actually threatening the eurozone's prospects. Here's the key quote: The eurozone has become more stable after lots of efforts, some from me....the euro foreign-exchange rate is dangerously high. The euro's weakness in 2012 has been credited with improving the region's exports - just this morning, Italy reported that it posted a world trade surplus of \u20ac2.36bn in November 2012, from a deficit of \u20ac1.58bn in 2011. Falling domestic demand was also a factor (imports fell by nearly \u20ac3bn, while exports rose by \u20ac1bn). Ireland's prime minister has told the European parliament that his country will exit its bailout before 2013 is out - cementing its reputation as Europe's austerity poster-child. Speaking in Strasbourg, Enda Kenny pointed to the recovery in Ireland's sovereign debt (latest bond prices show it could borrow for 10 years at just 4.2%). Ireland's EU presidency, he said, will be all about: stability, jobs and growth. Kenny also pointed to the deepening jobless crisis, calling it \"the deepest hurt\" in Europe, and warning that a generation was growing up who believed their elected leaders had failed to give them a proper chance in life. Spain's prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, urged fellow eurozone leaders to do more to stimulate growth, in an interview published by the Financial Times this morning. Rajoy said that euro area countries who are performing best should push policies that would help the whole region to recover, in a pretty clear nudge at Germany: I think that in this moment, when there is a need for growth, those who are able to implement growth policies should do it. What is clear is that you cannot ask Spain to adopt expansionary policies at this time. But those countries that can, should. Rajoy's own \u20ac65bn austerity package has helped to push Spain deeper into recession, as he strives to hit Brussels' deficit reduction targets. The full transcript of the interview, by Tobias Buck and FT editor Lionel Barber, is online here. Here are a few highlights. On the push for Catalan independence: The unity of Spain goes back more than five centuries. This is the oldest country in Europe. On Spain's reluctance to take help from the European Central Bank, though its outright monetary transactions programme: People might say that I wasn\u2019t right by not entering the OMT. I am not really bothered by that ... We took a decision that was right for Spain. On his performance since taking office: But in the year since I took over the government I reduced the public deficit in a situation where we were in recession. I pushed through structural reforms and a reform of the banking sector. New car registration data has shown the weakness of the eurozone economy - with the market shrinking at its fastest pace in more than two years. Car sales across Europe fell 16.3% in December to 799,407 vehicles, the biggest monthly fall since October 2010. Here's Reuters take: Annual car sales volumes in the EU fell 8.2% to 12.05m vehicles in 2012, Acea said. In the eurozone, they dropped 11.3% to just under 9m, according to Reuters' calculations. Acea's data shows showed how demand for cars in Europe bounced back in 2009, but has been sliding ever since... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis - and other key events in the world economy. Growth, or the lack of it, is the big issue so far this morning. Overnight the World Bank has slashed its economic forecasts again, warning that developed nations will struggle in 2013. The bank now expects the world economy to grow by just 2.4% this year, down from the rosier 3% it predicted in June. That would be just 0.1 percentage point higher than last year's growth. It predicts the eurozone will shrink by 0.1%, ripping up the forecast of 0.7% growth announced seven months ago, describing the global economic environment as \"fragile and prone to further disappointment\". It cited four main threats to the global economy, with the eurozone crisis top of the list: While diminished, downside risks to the global economy persist and include a stalling of progress on the Euro Area crisis, debt and fiscal issues in the United States, the possibility of a sharp slowing of investment in China, and a disruption in global oil supplies. Andrew Burns, the World Bank\u2019s director of global economic trends, admitted that the bank had been a little too upbeat last summer, telling reporters that: What we\u2019re seeing is the recovery that we anticipated in June being pushed a little further back in time, beginning closer to the end of the first quarter, into the second quarter of 2013. The World Bank also warned emerging nations that they couldn't rely on the west to drive economic growth - as the eurozone crisis could escalate, or US budget negotiations could collapse: Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes: Highlighting the risks from a relapse in the euro area and from the political in-fighting in the US over the budget, the bank said poor countries needed to build up their economic strength because they could not rely on high-income countries to drag them along. A wake-up call, perhaps, to those who confidently declare that the worst of the crisis is over. And with weak European car sales announced this morning (more to follow), growth remains the big issue. As usual, I'll be tracking the latest developments in the eurozone and beyond - including Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, speaking at the European parliament, and the German government's new economic forecasts.",

Widely seen as a landmark event in the campaign to bring catharsis to a political establishment whose corrupt goings-on are perceived as the root of Greece\u2019s ills, it takes place in an atmosphere that is both febrile and tense. \u201cThe mood today was extremely explosive and we haven\u2019t even got to the vote yet,\u201d said one MP in the 300-seat House.</p> <p>Lawmakers will decide whether to launch a parliamentary investigation against two former prime ministers \u2013 the socialist George Papandreou and the former vice president of the European Central Bank Lucas Papademos \u2013 following a proposal by the nationalist Independent Greeks party to probe the erstwhile leaders for breach of duty in pursuing suspected tax evaders named on the notorious list. Two ex finance ministers - George Papaconstantinou and Evangelos Venizelos, who as head of the Socialist Pasok party is a leader in the tri-partite coalition - will also be the focus of the ballot although almost nobody believes that anyone but Papaconstantinou will actually end up being probed. \u201cWhat we are going to see is a lot of parliamentary games because the whole thing is a set up,\u201d the spokesman of the main opposition Syriza party, Panos Skourletis, told me this afternoon. \u201cThe long and short is that this list went unused for 17 months which in itself is criminal&#xa0;when other countries in the euro zone were pursuing tax evaders.\u201d</p> <p>With the government commanding 169 seats in the House,&#xa0;Skourletis said he did not expect the&#xa0;parliament to endorse Syriza\u2019s proposal that Venizelos also face criminal prosecution for failing to utilize the list, first handed by the then Frenhc finance minister Christine Lagarde to Papaconstantinou in late 2010.</p> <p>\u201cPeople want to see punishment [meted out] but ultimately it is Papaconstantinou who is likely to take the brunt,\u201d he added.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fe6537e9-860a-4ab5-bab6-75ff38fe38e7\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/16/1358357450072/ae408270-eab9-4b08-9c92-ee68c9824216-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou speaks during a news conference in Athens, in 2010.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Papaconstantinou, during his time as finance minister in 2010.

Overnight the <strong>World Bank</strong> has slashed its economic forecasts again, warning that developed nations will struggle in 2013.</p> <p>The bank now expects the world economy to grow by just 2.4% this year, down from the rosier 3% it predicted in June. That would be just 0.1 percentage point higher than last year's growth.</p> <p>It predicts the eurozone will shrink by 0.1%, ripping up the forecast of 0.7% growth announced seven months ago, describing the global economic environment as \"fragile and prone to further disappointment\".</p> <p>It cited four main threats to the global economy, with the eurozone crisis top of the list:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While diminished, downside risks to the global economy persist and include a stalling of progress on the Euro Area crisis, debt and fiscal issues in the United States, the possibility of a sharp slowing of investment in China, and a disruption in global oil supplies.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/andrew-burns/\">Andrew Burns</a>, the World Bank\u2019s director of global economic trends, admitted that the bank had been a little too upbeat last summer, telling reporters that:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What we\u2019re seeing is the recovery that we anticipated in June being pushed a little further back in time, beginning closer to the end of the first quarter, into the second quarter of 2013.</p> </blockquote> <p>The World Bank also warned emerging nations that they couldn't rely on the west to drive economic growth - as the eurozone crisis could escalate, or US budget negotiations could collapse:</p> <p>Our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/jan/16/world-bank-poor-countries-growth\">economics editor, Larry Elliott, writes</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Highlighting the risks from a relapse in the euro area and from the political in-fighting in the US over the budget, the bank said poor countries needed to build up their economic strength because they could not rely on high-income countries to drag them along.</p> </blockquote> <p>A wake-up call, perhaps, to those who confidently declare that the worst of the crisis is over. And with weak European car sales announced this morning (<em>more to follow</em>), growth remains the big issue.</p> <p>As usual, I'll be tracking the latest developments in the eurozone and beyond - including Irish prime minister, Enda Kenny, speaking at the European parliament, and the German government's new economic forecasts.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-01-16T09:31:09.711Z\">at 9.31am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's transatlantic trade links with America are more important and those with Europe less significant than previously thought, according to a new way of calculating the true value of international commerce. In a study likely to intensify the political debate about Britain's role in the European Union, a joint initiative by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Trade Organisation revised upwards the strength of the UK-US trade relationship. The initiative \u2013 which looks beneath the gross value of trade to look at the countries that provide the parts and services that go into imports and exports \u2013 found that the US received a \"much higher\" share of UK exports on a so-called value added basis. Ahead of David Cameron's big speech on Europe this week, there have been warnings from business leaders to the prime minister of the risks of jeopardising Britain's vital trade links with the EU, while Eurosceptics have said stronger links should be established with faster-growing regions of the world. The OECD/WTO findings show that the EU as a whole is a more important trading partner for Britain than the US, but that more of Britain's lucrative exports than previously believed head across the Atlantic. According to the new methodology, the high value content of Britain's service sector exports to the US make them more valuable than they appear at first sight. The OECD and WTO said 60% of the value of UK gross exports originated from the service sector. By contrast, the report said UK exports to other EU countries were \"at least partly intermediate services and inputs that are then further processed and shipped to other countries (in particular to the US)\". On a value-added basis, Britain's trade with France and Ireland was sharply lower. Work by the OECD and the WTO, which tries to give a more accurate picture of the process by which goods and services are produced in a globalised economy, also found that America's politically charged trade deficit with China was 25% smaller once the value of manufacturing components imported into the country were taken into account. Washington has been putting pressure on Beijing to allow a revaluation of the yuan that would make Chinese exports less competitive. Both the OECD and the WTO were keen to flag up the results of the exercise in order to combat growing protectionist pressures. The two international bodies say that barriers to imports will backfire because they also hurt exporters. \"Today, we have to think about goods and services as 'made in the world', forcing a radical change in how we need to look at trade flows,\" Angel Gurr\u00eda, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said. \"This growing process of international fragmentation, driven by technological progress and trade policy reforms, challenges our convention wisdom on how we look at and interpret trade policies.\" Gurr\u00eda launched the initial set of data alongside Pascal Lamy, the director-general of the World Trade Organisation; European trade commissioner Karel de Gucht; and New Zealand trade minister Tim Groser.",

Details of the payroll come just a day after the bank was forced to back down from plans to defer bonuses until April so that its highly paid staff could avoid the 50% tax rate. The size of the bill to pay staff is 6% higher than a year ago. However, the average individual payouts to staff are higher as the number of employees has fallen by 3%. Staff will find out in the coming days what their bonuses for 2012 will be. Some of them will be expecting to receive millions of pounds . Pressure from Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King \u2013 who said he found it \"depressing\" that highly paid staff might attempt to avoid the highest rate of income tax \u2013 forced Goldman to abandon plans to defer part-payment of bonuses from 2009, 2010 and 2011 which were due to be handed to staff this year. The top rate of income tax falls to 45% on 6 April, the start of the new tax year. \"While economic conditions remained challenging for much of last year, the strengths of our business model and client franchise, coupled with our focus on disciplined management, delivered solid performance for our shareholders,\" said Lloyd Blankfein. Goldman's chairman and chief executive. \"The firm's strategic position provides a solid basis on which to grow and generate superior returns.\" The bank stressed that its ratio of compensation (pay) to net revenues (income) \u2013 a closely watched measure of a banks' generosity towards its staff \u2013 was the second lowest ever at 37.9%, compared with 42.4% for 2011. Revenues were higher across most of the business with the exception of equities. Investment banking revenues were up 13% to $5bn for 2012, although corporate advisory revenues were flat at $2bn. The firm, the highest profile of the Wall Street banks, issued its figures just hours before JP Morgan revealed its chief executive Jamie Dimon had taken a 50% cut in his pay to $11.5m from $23m in the wake of the London Whale trading incident, which cost the bank $6bn. Despite the losses caused by the so-called chief investment office in London, the JP Morgan reported a third consecutive year of record income. \"The firm's results reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses for the fourth quarter and the full year,\" said Dimon, whose salary of $1.5m is enhanced by around $10m of share-based payments. Earlier this week the bank was ordered to make improvements to its control functions by regulators in the US while the Financial Services Authority admitted it had referred the London Whale incident to its enforcement division.",

However, the execution period will be long and potentially volatile and the profit improvement does not look enough to lift returns to the cost of capital. A demand recovery is required, which looks unlikely near term.",

He said Rough Trade sales in the latest quarter were up 8% on the previous year and the company is in the process of launching a new online store and an outpost in Brooklyn, New York. \"UK music is in rude health, despite the woes of the last outdated chain of entertainment retailer,\" he said. \"The collapse of HMV is sad but ultimately a necessary process of renewal that will result in a significantly brighter future for UK music consumers.\" He added that independent record labels would \"love to see a rejuvenated, smaller HMV return with fresh vigour under new ownership\". Other independent record store owners also hoped HMV would carry on in some form \u2013 arguing the existence of a nationwide chain encourages consumers to shop for physical music. Tim Winter of Harold Moores Records in Soho, London, said HMV's flagship store, a short walk away on Oxford Street, attracts customers to the area, which is also home to a clutch of independent record shops, \"in the hope of a tangible musical experience\". Kat Bayley, director general of the Entertainment Retailers Association \u2013 which represents music, video and computer game retailers \u2013 said the industry was determined to help HMV survive. \"Both music and video companies are painfully aware of the consequences of losing a retailer responsible for about a quarter of UK physical music and video sales. We have to hope they will not stand by and watch HMV go down,\" she said. \"There clearly is a viable business model for an entertainment retailer on the UK high street. It is up to the administrators now to do their job and take the steps necessary to make it possible.\" But British rapper Professor Green, also known as Stephen Paul Manderson, was less certain: . \"I'd rather the death of the internet to be honest,\" he said on Twitter. \"Everything has to be so instant nowadays, it'll be the death of creativity, everything is churned out so quickly. As a kid saving up to buy a tape, record or CD was one of the best things about music, the anticipation. Then playing it non-stop.\" Then he added: \"I'm saying all this sitting here on an Apple laptop that doesn't have a CD drive \u2026\" \u2022 This article was amended on 17 January 2013. The original said 3% of the 189m singles sold last year were physical CDs. This has been corrected to say 0.3%.",
