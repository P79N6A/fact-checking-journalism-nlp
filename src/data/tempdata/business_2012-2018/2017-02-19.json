      "bodyText": "The proposed \u00a3115bn takeover of Unilever by Kraft Heinz has been called off, just two days after the offer was announced. The takeover of the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant would have been one of the largest deals in corporate history but was resisted at Unilever and had provoked political unease over British jobs. Unilever rejected the offer by the American firm on Friday, describing the approach as having \u201cno merit, strategic or financial\u201d. Kraft Heinz was expected to return with a higher offer, but late on Sunday the two firms issued a surprise joint statement announcing no deal would go ahead. It said: \u201cUnilever and Kraft Heinz hereby announce that Kraft Heinz has amicably agreed to withdraw its proposal for a combination of the two companies. \u201cUnilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard. Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever.\u201d The US food giant had been preparing to meet top tier shareholders, which include BlackRock, Leverhulme Trust and Legal &amp; General, to convince them to accept the deal. But the strength of resistance to the proposal saw Kraft decide over the weekend to back away. As well as Unilever\u2019s clear reluctance, unions had raised fears over jobs, and discussions had started with the business secretary, Greg Clark, over a move that appeared to have strong echoes of the takeover of Cadbury\u2019s by Kraft in 2010, a deal singled out for criticism by Theresa May last year. A spokesperson for Kraft Heinz said: \u201c[Our] interest was made public at an extremely early stage. Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction. \u201cIt is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value. We remain focused on driving long-term value while always putting our consumers first.\u201d Unions had voiced fears over the 9,000 jobs in Britain that could be affected under a takeover of Unilever by Kraft Heinz, where billionaire investor Warren Buffet owns more than a quarter of the shares and which is also backed by 3G, a Brazilian private equity firm. Unite, Britain\u2019s biggest union which directly represents about 2,000 of the 7,500 Unilever staff in the UK, welcomed the news. A Unite spokesman said that while the union was pleased that Kraft Heinz had signalled their withdrawal, the bid illustrated a need to reform takeover rules: \u201cIt shows the need for a \u2018Cadbury rule\u2019 which takes into account the issues like jobs and consumers in these circumstances, so it\u2019s not just down to how deep someone\u2019s pockets are, to throw money at shareholders.\u201d The Cadbury rule is a reference to the controversial \u00a311.5bn takeover of chocolate maker Cadbury by Kraft in 2010. Pledges to save factories were reneged on almost immediately, before the firm was spun off to form a separate firm, Mondelez, while customers believed the quality of products such as its Creme Egg were downgraded. A source close to the bid earlier insisted there was \u201cno comparison\u201d between the Kraft Heinz company and its management team and the Kraft that took over Cadbury \u2013 but admitted that there would be stringent cost-cutting and \u201csynergies\u201d including job losses should Unilever be taken over. Downing Street did not confirm reports that the prime minister had ordered top officials to examine the planned takeover of Unilever to see if it could merit government intervention. A spokesperson for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), had said it was continuing to monitor the situation closely. The bid of \u00a3115bn would have made it the second largest takeover in corporate history, beaten only by Vodafone\u2019s $203bn (\u00a3163bn) takeover of Mannesmann in 2000. A combined Kraft-Unilever would have been valued at more than \u00a3200bn and control 3% of the global packaged food market, according to Euromonitor. The share price in both firms may be expected to slide back on Monday, after surging on news of the offer on Friday. Buffett\u2019s fortune was briefly boosted by another $5.7bn purely on his personal stake in Kraft Heinz, whose shares rose 10%, while Unilever shares rose 13.4% to a record high. The takeover bid was fiercely resisted by the board, led by Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever, although he would have stood to earn almost \u00a312m in shares under a sale. The Dutch CEO has made a name as an unusual advocate for sustainable business and global concerns such as poverty and climate change.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s major banks will be in the spotlight this week as they unveil their full year figures, with Royal Bank of Scotland forecast to make losses of more than \u00a36bn and HSBC expected to face questions about a boardroom overhaul. The controversy over bankers\u2019 pay is likely to be reignited as they disclose the size of their bonus pools and how much their bosses have received during a year when the vote for Brexit has helped turn the government\u2019s attention on public anger over rising executive pay. RBS will continue to remain a major focus as its loss for 2016 will mean it will have spent nine years in the red since its taxpayer rescue in 2008. The loss is likely tobe \u00a355bn \u2013 more than the \u00a345bn that was pumped in by the Treasury to stop the Edinburgh-based bank collapsing. In contrast, Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 bailed out at same time and is almost free from taxpayer support. Barclays and Standard Chartered also report the first full year results since the cut in interest rates after Brexit, which puts pressure on banks\u2019 profitability. \u201cBank results look like they will be a mix of the good, the bad and the ugly this time around. Litigation still looms large, particularly for RBS which has a plateful of problems to digest, while low interest rates continue to present a challenge for the core business of banking,\u201d said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The Treasury will also face scrutiny of its plan announced on Friday to free RBS of its obligation to Brussels to spin off 300 branches. Instead of meeting state aid rules by selling the network \u2013 which was dubbed Williams &amp; Glyn \u2013 the Treasury has proposed that RBS adopt other measures to inject competition into the small banking market at a cost of \u00a3750m. If approved, the deal with Brussels over small business banking will remove one of the key uncertainties which have been depressing the bank\u2019s share price. The shares closed at 242p on Friday \u2013 less than half the 502p average price that taxpayers paid for a 79% stake and before the deal over W&amp;G was announced. Clarity over the state aid obligation would resolve one of the hurdles chancellor Philip Hammond cited last year when he abandoned any hope of selling off any more shares in RBS \u2013 in which the stake is now 73% after parcel of shares was sold in 2015. Among other issues raised by the chancellor is the uncertainty over a settlement with the US over a toxic bond mis-selling scandal and last month the bank took a \u00a33.1bn hit in preparation for this. Gareth Thomas, the MP who chairs the Co-operative Party, said it would have been better to convert W&amp;G into a mutual. \u201cWhilst there have been many reforms the lack of competition in British banking is worse now than in 2008 and the re-privatisation of RBS will only make that worse,\u201d said Thomas. Among the ideas the Treasury has proposed to Brussels is a fund for so-called challenger banks to the big four of RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC as well as dowries to help them encourage small businesses to switch from RBS. OakNorth Bank, one of the challengers, pointed out that 80% of small businesses bank with the big four. Rishi Khosla, chief executive of OakNorth, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important that this fund doesn\u2019t just focus on current accounts, but that it is used to increase challenger banks\u2019 capabilities to deliver a range of products and services, including short and long-term business loans\u201d. HSBC kicks off the reporting season on Tuesday after a 55% rise in its share price since the referendum, fuelled by the fall in sterling as it makes most of its profits abroad. Also on the agenda is the boardroom changes HSBC promised a year ago when chairman Douglas Flint said the bank hoped to nominate his successor in 2017 who in turn could start the planning for a new chief executive. Gary Greenwood, banks analyst at Shore Capital said there may be questions for \u201cmore clarity\u201d on succession planning at HSBC. One investor said that as it was one of the biggest companies in the world the bank should be able to keep its pledge while Jeannette Andrews, corporate governance manager, at Legal and General Investment Management said the firm had welcomed the commitment \u201c from HSBC last year to appoint an independent chairman to the board in 2017.\u201d Brexit may loom large over the banking results. \u201cBoth HSBC and Standard Chartered have benefited from currency tailwinds, as has Barclays which is also seeing restructuring starting to finally gain traction. Lloyds still remains in decent shape, though it\u2019s the canary in the coalmine as far as Brexit is concerned, given how thoroughly it is plugged into the grass roots of the UK economy,\u201d said Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s Khalaf.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "All things considered, it could hardly have gone better for Britain\u2019s retailers in 2016. Shops and online outlets were fully braced for a big hit to activity in the period after the EU referendum but it didn\u2019t happen. Consumers spent in the summer. They spent in the autumn and they spent at Christmas too. That spree is over. Retailers are going to find life tougher in 2017. Those facing the prospect of higher business rates alongside a dip in demand will experience a painful double-whammy. Three factors explain why the pundits who confidently predicted carnage in the high street after the Brexit vote were wrong: consumer psychology; policy changes; and the economic fundamentals underpinning consumer demand. Taking those points in reverse order, spending was supported by rising employment, low interest rates and rising real incomes. The big slump in oil prices at the end of 2015 had pushed down inflation and reduced fuel bills. Individuals were getting better off, had lost their fear of being made redundant, and had more money left over when the essentials were paid for. These benign conditions became even more conducive to spending when the Bank of England stimulated the economy in early August, something it was always likely to do once Britain had voted to leave. The idea that Threadneedle Street would sit back and do nothing was for the birds. Not that consumers needed much encouragement. The 52% who voted for leave spent because they were celebrating; the 48% who voted for remain spent as a form of retail therapy. Either way, the evidence is that people quickly got on with their lives. Strong consumer spending was the reason the economy grew by 0.6% in both the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Activity was especially strong in November, but then fell back sharply in December. A further small fall in January ran counter to the City\u2019s expectations and has left a strong impression that the party\u2019s over. This is probably true, even though some caution needs to be taken with the retail sales data. The figures are subject to seasonal adjustment to take account of the fact spending rises strongly in November and December before collapsing in January. The raw numbers from the Office for National Statistics show that there was a 13% rise in the value of retail sales (excluding fuel) between November and December followed by a 30% drop between December and January. Getting the seasonal adjustment right with these sorts of monthly gyrations is quite tricky and has been made harder by the recent popularity of Black Friday in November, when retailers offer early Christmas bargains. This has had the effect of bringing forward spending that would normally take place in December. But it is also likely that the prospect of higher inflation prompted consumers to buy big ticket items in 2016 that they would otherwise have put off until 2017. To that extent, some of the growth seen last year has been borrowed from the future. That\u2019s rational behaviour, because inflation doubled to 1.8% between October and January and is certain to go higher over the months ahead. So far, the pick-up in the cost of living has been the result of the global rise in oil prices but retailers are also struggling with the higher prices paid for imports as a result of the post-referendum fall in the pound. Tough competitive pressures and the current softening of demand mean that only part of the increases in costs will be passed on but consumers are still going to feel the impact. In July and August last year, inflation was running at 0.6% and earnings were going up by 2.5%. Annual inflation will be running at 3% before long and unless wages start to rise real incomes will start falling. If the past was any guide to the present, wage inflation would already be accelerating. The last time unemployment was as low as it is now was in 2005 when average earnings were growing at annual rate of 4%. Currently, they are increasing at about 2.5%. For a while, this weakness in wage growth could be explained as a temporary response to the savage recession in 2008-09. Workers sacrificed earnings in order to prevent being laid off. The result was to spread the pain: a much smaller increase in unemployment but falling living standards for those in work. But this interpretation is starting to look a little threadbare. As might have been expected, the rate of earnings growth fell sharply during the period when the economy was contracting. Output collapsed by about 6% over six quarters in 2008-09 and by the time growth had bottomed out earnings growth had fallen to 2%. Yet it continued to fall even after recovery began. By 2013, earnings growth had slipped to 1% and it remained there well into 2014 even though by that time the jobless rate had dropped from 8% to 6% and was falling fast. When earnings growth did at last start to pick up in late 2014 the expectation was that the upward trend would continue. But that didn\u2019t happen. Wage inflation reached 2.5% in early 2015 and has remained there ever since. Britain should be at the point where earnings growth starts to rise. Productivity has started to improve, inflation has picked up from unusually low levels, the number of workers resigning in order to move to a new job has reached a post-crisis high and there are plenty of job vacancies. That should ensure some pick-up in earnings growth this year, but the improvement is likely to be modest and that means earnings will struggle to keep pace with prices. As a result, consumer spending will be squeezed and growth more dependent on the performance of exports. Retailers will only have another bumper year if wage inflation picks up markedly and that looks improbable. Economists have been arguing about whether there is a strong relationship between wages and unemployment ever since Bill Phillips published his seminal paper on the subject in 1958. Looking at data from 1861 to 1957, Phillips found that when unemployment came down wage inflation went up and vice versa. The Phillips curve was born, became fashionable in the 1960s and then fell out of favour in the 1970s when, in the era of stagflation, unemployment and inflation both rose. Over the years, it has become clear that there is a link between unemployment and wage growth, although not quite the neat long-term relationship that Phillips detected. Falling unemployment eventually leads to wage inflation but the jobless total has to fall a long way for workers to be able to exert any real bargaining power. There has been a structural change in the labour market that leaves the peak in wage inflation lower in each economic cycle.",

Consumers spent in the summer. They spent in the autumn and they spent at Christmas too.</p> <p>That spree is over. Retailers are going to find life tougher in 2017. Those facing the prospect of higher business rates alongside a dip in demand will experience a painful double-whammy.</p> <p>Three factors explain why the pundits who confidently predicted carnage in the high street after the Brexit vote were wrong: consumer psychology; policy changes; and the economic fundamentals underpinning consumer demand.</p> <p>Taking those points in reverse order, spending was supported by rising employment, low interest rates and rising real incomes. The big slump in oil prices at the end of 2015 had pushed down inflation and reduced fuel bills. Individuals were getting better off, had lost their fear of being made redundant, and had more money left over when the essentials were paid for.</p> <p>These benign conditions became even more conducive to spending when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/aug/04/bank-of-england-cuts-uk-interest-rates\">Bank of England stimulated the economy</a> in early August, something it was always likely to do once Britain had voted to leave.

      "bodyText": "Energy companies are hardly popular at the best of times, but British Gas must have hoped for some praise when it said it was freezing energy prices until August, a timely announcement made on the same day Scottish Power unveiled a 7.8% increase. However, the move \u2013 which is being funded by cost cutting \u2013 could prove to be a temporary respite for consumers, given wholesale prices are still rising. Barclays analysts said: \u201cWe expect [British Gas owner] Centrica will have to raise tariffs in August, or face a retail ... margin collapse from 2015\u2019s 7% to less than 3.7% over the next 12 months.\u201d In any case, the freeze is unikely to deflect the usual criticism about British Gas\u2019s excessive profits when Centrica reports its results on Friday. The UK energy business is expected to see full-year earnings rise from \u00a3891m to \u00a3950m, with the group\u2019s total profits \u2013 including its exploration and US operations \u2013 up from \u00a31.11bn to \u00a31.17bn. There is also the prospect of the government introducing a price cap, given the outrage over energy price rises. Ofgem is already set to introduce a price cap for prepayment customers in April, which analysts say could knock \u00a380m off British Gas earnings. And despite its consumer-friendly price move, British Gas is never far from controversy. Last month, it had to pay \u00a39.5m for IT failures that meant business customers received incorrect and late bills. National Express gets off the last train Another area which regularly attracts more than its share of complaints is the rail industry, with delays, cancellations, overcrowding and constant fare increases guaranteed to raise the ire of passengers. But one company set to avoid this in future is National Express. Once the UK\u2019s biggest train operator, it sold its last franchise, the London-to-Essex route c2c, to Italy\u2019s Trenitalia for nearly \u00a373m this month. Operators have become less enamoured of the rail sector, with profits squeezed and tougher franchise terms imposed. National Express will now concentrate on its coach and bus businesses, and chief executive Dean Finch says the sale provides \u201cthe opportunity to invest further in our strong pipeline of growth opportunities in markets where we consistently receive strong returns\u201d. It has not ruled out returning to UK rail with new franchise bids, but it seems unlikely this will happen in the near future. The company has promised more details of its future strategy and the implications of the sale of the rail franchise when it reports full-year results on Thursday. Banks buoyed by Trump bump Hints from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen last week that US interest rates may soon rise came at the right time for the UK financial sector. In advance of the bank reporting season, share prices have been boosted by hopes that higher rates will boost margins, while the prospect of Trump-inspired economic growth and a relaxation of regulations has also given support to the sector. HSBC is the first UK bank to report its 2016 figures, and with much of its business overseas it has been helped by the slide in sterling since the Brexit vote. But investors will be keen to know more about its performance in emerging markets, its cost-cutting, including closing UK branches, and any further regulatory issues. Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland follow in quick succession, and all but the latter are expected to show solid numbers. RBS, however, is set to report a \u00a36bn plunge into the red after provisions for possible fines \u2013 its ninth consecutive year of losses. Lloyds is forecast to report a \u00a34bn profit, up from \u00a31.6bn, but some of the shine will be taken off by the \u00a3245m fraud at HBOS, which has left it having to compensate victims. Meanwhile, Barclays could beat consensus forecasts due to foreign exchange movements, according to analysts at Investec.",

I was a little nobody and I wanted to say this isn\u2019t right to the director of Topshop,\u201d Elizabeth Dunn, a bespoke shoemaker and London transplant, tells me, her voice rising with emotion. At Brooklyn Shoe Space, a professional shoemaker co-working space and collective that also offers classes for the public on how to make everything from simple moccasins to stitched oxfords and high heels, former employees of Big Shoe are hoping they can change the industry, one step at a time. As Keiko Hirosue, the founder, talks, three other shoemakers in the collective have made their way to the children\u2019s table where we are sitting, sharing their stories of leaving the corporate design world to strike out for themselves. The toddler-height table was added at the shoe collective when one of the members, Ritika Wahal, a designer of children\u2019s shoes, asked Hirosue if she could bring her son, then only 18 months old, to the workshop with her. Hirosue responded by getting small furniture and toys to keep the boy occupied while his mother worked on her shoe line at the wooden worktable two feet away.

      "bodyText": "A small corner of Merseyside has become the centre of the corporate universe. Vauxhall\u2019s plant in Ellesmere Port is less than seven miles away from Unilever\u2019s base in Port Sunlight on the Wirral peninsula. The thousands of workers in those two places now face an anxious wait for the outcome of takeover talks involving their parent companies. Last week General Motors revealed it was in talks with Groupe PSA, the owner of Peugeot and Citroen, about selling its European businesses, Opel and Vauxhall, while Unilever rejected a $143bn (\u00a3115bn) bid from Kraft Heinz. If both deals go ahead, job losses in the UK will be a genuine concern. GM\u2019s European business has not made a profit in the 21st century and the drop in the value of the pound has made carmaking in the UK even less attractive for a US company. And 3G Capital, the private equity fund that teamed up with Warren Buffett to merge Heinz and Kraft, has a reputation for cost-cutting. Brexit is clearly playing a role in the proposed deals. The fall in the value of the pound against the dollar since the vote last June has led to writedowns on the value of GM\u2019s European operators and made it cheaper for Kraft Heinz to launch a bid for Unilever. Whether the deals actually happen is another matter. GM has flirted with the idea of extending its existing partnership with Peugeot for many years and the deal is mired in political difficulty. The UK and German governments are uncomfortable with the idea of Opel and Vauxhall being sold, while the French government owns a stake in PSA. Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz has a lot of work to do if it wants to buy Unilever. The US company\u2019s proposal was rejected because Unilever saw \u201cno merit, either financial or strategic, for shareholders\u201d. But Kraft Heinz indicated it was not giving up. Strategically, there doesn\u2019t look to be much that Kraft Heinz can offer Unilever. Only 40% of the Anglo-Dutch company\u2019s sales are actually in food and it has moved away from the mass-produced products that Kraft Heinz specialises in. Unilever\u2019s spreads business, which includes Flora, is the only significant remnant of this and its performance fluctuates depending on the direction of the entire market. Elsewhere in food, Unilever is focused on positioning brands such as Magnum ice creams as upmarket in the western world and increasing sales in emerging markets. In contrast, Kraft Heinz said in its results last Thursday that sales had fallen by 3.7% in the final three months of 2016, sending its shares down 4%. As for Unilever\u2019s collection of personal care and home care brands, Kraft Heinz does not have much of a track record in this area. However, every company has a price, so if Kraft Heinz tables an irresistible offer then Unilever\u2019s directors and shareholders will put these concerns to one side. The US firm\u2019s initial offer was at just an 18% premium to Unilever\u2019s share price before the deal talks were revealed, which is small by the standards of corporate M&amp;A. Although the sheer size of Unilever will limit the premium, the Anglo-Dutch company clearly feels this price does not reflect the risks involved in the deal. Kraft Heinz is reportedly keen to use Unilever\u2019s strong credit rating to raise debt for the transaction \u2013 its own credit rating is close to junk \u2013 and part of the deal would involve Unilever investors getting shares in the enlarged company, so its future success would matter. Both these factors should push the premium higher. There are some factors in Kraft Heinz\u2019s favour. Unilever\u2019s recent row with Tesco about increasing the price of Marmite shows it is working hard to protect profit margins at a time when costs are rising and supermarkets are trying to push food prices down. If Unilever combined with Kraft Heinz then it would have even more muscle in negotiations with supermarkets, and the US company\u2019s cost-cutting abilities would be valuable. A slightly higher offer could make seeing off 3G and Warren Buffett a formidable task for Unilever. Farewell, Williams &amp; Glyn: your loss is a mixed blessing When Royal Bank of Scotland reports its results for 2016 this week, there will be another painful reminder of the 2008 crisis. The numbers are eye-watering: the ninth consecutive year of annual losses will mean the bailed-out bank has sunk into the red by more than \u00a355bn since taxpayers pumped in \u00a345bn to keep it alive. And a proposed deal announced by the chancellor on Friday \u2013 designed to free the bank from the necessity of having to divest 300 branches \u2013 has added to the strain on its fragile finances. To satisfy the penalty for state aid meted out by Brussels as a result of the bailout, RBS said it would need to take another \u00a3750m hit \u2013 indicating that the loss it reports on Friday will be close to a colossal \u00a37bn. It is a sorry story and one made all the more woeful by the fact that bailed-out rival Lloyds is on the brink of being freed from taxpayer ownership. Philip Hammond\u2019s proposal, though, to take a \u00a3750m hit and free RBS from having to spin off the branches will be a relief. The bank\u2019s attempt to divest the branches \u2013 which were being packaged up under the revived brand of Williams &amp; Glyn \u2013 has been fraught with difficulties and has already cost \u00a31.8bn. Buyers have walked away: and after the Bank of England cut interest rates to rock bottom levels in the wake of the vote for Brexit, RBS boss Ross McEwan concluded the operation was not viable as a standalone entity. The chancellor had made it clear that the uncertainties surrounding W&amp;G, as well as a hard-to-quantify bill the bank faces over a US bond mis-selling scandal a decade ago, were the main obstacles to selling off the 73% stake that taxpayers still own in the bank. So in setting out alternative proposals to Brussels to spend \u00a3750m injecting competition into the banking market, Hammond is removing one of the key hurdles in the way of extricating the taxpayer from the bank. Whether it will be good news for customers is another story. W&amp;G was supposed to be a new presence on the high street; its absence will be felt. PM\u2019s boardroom pay blitz promise looks set to fizzle out Theresa May\u2019s post-Brexit vote pledge to clamp down on corporate excess and put workers on boards was to be welcomed. But with the government\u2019s consultation on pay closing on Friday, there is a real risk that the prime minster\u2019s words will turn out to be empty. Major companies will no doubt be allowed to get on with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, despite the odd tinkering with the current rules that will be dressed up as radical reform. Boardroom bosses will keep getting pay rises bigger than their staff and continue to regard the odd run-in with shareholders at annual general meetings as a price worth paying. The fear is that the warning from Stefan Stern, head of the High Pay Centre, will prove to be right. He is a supporter of publishing pay ratios \u2013 an embarrassment to boardrooms as the bosses of FTSE 100 companies are currently paid around 147 times the average wage of employees. Last week, he predicted that if bosses\u2019 pay kept rising at the same rate as in the past, that ratio would reach more than 300 to one in the next two decades. Scandalous.",

Buyers have walked away: and after the Bank of England cut interest rates to rock bottom levels in the wake of the vote for Brexit, RBS boss Ross McEwan concluded the operation was not viable as a standalone entity.</p> <p>The chancellor had made it clear that the uncertainties surrounding W&amp;G, as well as a hard-to-quantify bill the bank faces over a US bond mis-selling scandal a decade ago, were the main obstacles to selling off the 73% stake that taxpayers still own in the bank.</p> <p>So in setting out alternative proposals to Brussels to spend \u00a3750m injecting competition into the banking market, Hammond is removing one of the key hurdles in the way of extricating the taxpayer from the bank.</p> <p>Whether it will be good news for customers is another story. W&amp;G was supposed to be a new presence on the high street; its absence will be felt.</p> <h2>PM\u2019s boardroom pay blitz promise looks set to fizzle out</h2> <p>Theresa May\u2019s post-Brexit vote pledge to clamp down on corporate excess and put workers on boards was to be welcomed.</p> <p>But with the government\u2019s consultation on pay closing on Friday, there is a real risk that the prime minster\u2019s words will turn out to be empty.</p> <p>Major companies will no doubt be allowed to get on with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, despite the odd tinkering with the current rules that will be dressed up as radical reform. Boardroom bosses will keep getting pay rises bigger than their staff and continue to regard the odd run-in with shareholders at annual general meetings as a price worth paying.</p> <p>The fear is that the warning from Stefan Stern, head of the <a href=\"http://highpaycentre.org/about\" title=\"\">High Pay Centre</a>, will prove to be right. He is a supporter of publishing pay ratios \u2013 an embarrassment to boardrooms as the bosses of FTSE 100 companies are currently paid around 147 times the average wage of employees.</p> <p>Last week, he predicted that if bosses\u2019 pay kept rising at the same rate as in the past, that ratio would reach more than 300 to one in the next two decades. Scandalous.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s has waded into the row over business rates, describing the existing system archaic and calling for \u201cfundamental reforms\u201d. Adding to mounting pressure on the government to reconsider the controversial levy, Mike Coupe said that the shake-up would reduce bills for online retailer Amazon while many of its high street rivals would face sharply higher bills. The supermarket boss is the latest critic of the first rates overhaul in seven years, which are due to come into effect from 1 April. Coupe said: \u201cThe way it currently stands, there is an advantage for those without bricks and mortar operations, so there\u2019s a strong case for a level playing field in business rates and taxation more generally.\u201d He added: \u201cBusinesses like ours with lots of property and employees face a bigger burden than others.\u201d The overhaul is linked to the revaluation of properties that should take place every five years but was controversially delayed in 2015 ahead of the general election. More than half a million firms face rates rises of up to 300%, according to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), although transitional reliefs would limit some of the pain. The government has mounted a staunch defence of the changes after business groups including the CBI, British Retail Consortium and the FSB made a joint call to ministers to rethink the changes. They are particularly concerned that small firms could be blocked from appealing against rates rises and have asked for that clause to be dropped. The shake-up also highlights the tax discrepancy between businesses that depend on physical shops and their online-only rivals. Sainsbury\u2019s is facing a rise of almost \u00a3120m to about \u00a3500m, while Amazon will enjoy a lower business rates bill for most of its huge warehouses, according to analysts. Coupe has called on ministers to undertake a wide-ranging review of the way businesses are taxed, taking into account changes in the retail sector such as the rise of online-only players. \u201cOur challenge to the government is for a fundamental reform of business rates, because we believe it is an archaic and outdated system. More than that, we\u2019d like the government to look at business taxation in general,\u201d he said. Business rates are linked to property valuations, so companies with properties concentrated in the south-east of England and cities will be disproportionately affected by the revaluation. Companies in London alone will face a \u00a39bn rise in rates over the next five years, while bills for those in the north are likely to stay the same or fall. Pubs, hospitals and hotels are also among those set to be landed with hefty increases. Business rates for some retailers will jump by 400% as fears mount that the revaluation will result in store closures. If the revaluation goes ahead, Coupe warned: \u201cWe could see high streets face serious challenges and ultimately more closures. It could impact investment in places that most need it, in areas of the country where there is already a marginal call on investment.\u201d The government has accused those that have raised concerns of \u201cscaremongering\u201d, claiming that the majority of firms will see a drop in rates or no change to their bills. David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cThree-quarters of businesses are actually going to see their business rates fall or stay the same. Outside London, average bills are falling by 11%. So it is right that we bring it up to date. \u201cIt is also right that there is transitional support for those one in four businesses that are seeing an increase in their business rates. We have got a \u00a33.6bn transitional package to try to smooth that increase. But it is right that we bring business rates values up to date to reflect current rental values.\u201d",
