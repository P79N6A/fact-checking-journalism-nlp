However, returning to the City will not be without its inconveniences \u2013 as even Diamond's friends admit his reputation is lower in Britain than almost anywhere else in the world. Diamond's name is still widely associated with some of the more emotive events of the financial crisis, as he was frequently criticised for the level of his pay and an aggressive attitude to business \u2013 even before the scandal over the fixing of the benchmark interest rate, Libor, forced him out of Barclays. In 2010 he was memorably dubbed the \"unacceptable face of banking\" by Lord Mandelson after it emerged that he had received cash and share awards that could net him \u00a363m. However, his downfall came in July last year, in the face of relentless pressure from politicians and regulators for him to go following the interest rate manipulation scandal which resulted in Barclays being fined \u00a3290m to settle claims that it used underhand tactics to try to rig financial markets. Marcus Agius, Barclays' then chairman, and Sir Michael Rake, the bank's most senior non-executive director, were summoned to see the then Bank of England governor Lord King, where they were told that \"Bob Diamond no longer enjoyed the support of his regulators\". That stain on the banker's reputation has been tricky to shift and it emerged last week that Diamond is to be called as a witness as part of Guardian Care Homes' \u00a370m suit alleging Barclays mis-sold it interest rate hedging products based on Libor. Quite how his return to banking will be viewed in Africa is unclear, as Barclays' own Africa business was forced to launch a charm offensive following the Libor fallout. However, sub-Saharan countries appear to be attractive investments for bankers, as only a quarter of the population is said to hold a bank account. The financier has also made no secret of wanting to invest in Africa, where his family foundation is active. He recently met senior officials in Nigeria, which helped fuel rumours he might be looking at one of the country's troubled banks. Diamond will be assisted in his latest project by the British-born Thakkar, who moved to Rwanda with his family when he was 12, before the family fled the Rwandan genocide to Uganda. He has said he started selling computer equipment to friends and his school in Kampala and built his business up into what became Mara Group. The new London-listed vehicle will be called Atlas Mara \u2013 after Diamond set up a company called Atlas Merchant Capital in New York this year as an old-style merchant bank that is looking to sign deals with partners. The pair's plan to raise money via a publicly-quoted cash shell with the purpose of buying assets in emerging markets is a controversial one.

He is widely credited with building Barclays' investment bank \u2013 Barclays Capital \u2013 which was an insignificant institution when he joined the firm in 1996. Within a year it had merged with the fund management and trading arms of Wells Fargo and Nikko Securities and its stellar growth meant it provided an increasing chunk of Barclays' overall profits, which had previously come from more traditional lending.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "George Osborne has received little flak for his austerity programme. Opinion pollsters say the public is even more convinced of the need to balance the government's books than it was when the chancellor arrived at the Treasury three and a half years ago. Voters need to be aware, though, that they are in this for the long haul. Osborne is only half done with spending cuts, which will continue not just for the current parliament but most of the next. The single most arresting statistic in last week's autumn statement was that by 2018-19, the squeeze on Whitehall departments means government will be smaller than at any time since at least 1948, when consistent data was first collected. A bit of care is needed with this comparison. It doesn't mean public spending as a share of national output will be lower than it was when Attlee was prime minister, because that figure includes welfare payments such as pensions, housing benefit and unemployment pay, which have increased since the 1940s. But it does include just about everything else: the day-to-day government spending, investment in infrastructure projects and debt interest payments. To a degree this is recognition that Britain is a poorer country than it was before the Great Recession. The level of GDP will not return to its pre-slump peak of early 2008 until the end of 2014 or the start of 2015, while it will take a full decade for real earnings to make up lost ground. But the shrinking of the state is also a political choice. The chancellor has decided the vast bulk of the reduction in the budget deficit will occur though cuts in spending rather than increases in taxation: an 86%-14% split according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. On current Treasury plans, this means that cuts in spending by Whitehall departments will be deeper in the next parliament than they have been in the current one. Between April 2011 and March 2016, the IFS says that public service cuts will average 2.3% a year; from 2016 to 2019 they are scheduled to be 3.7%. Put another way, so far the coalition has cut spending on public services by 8%; by 2018-19 this will have become a cut of 20%. There are alternatives if Osborne doubts whether the public's phlegmatic approach to austerity will endure an extension and a deepening of the programme. He could continue to trim spending at the current rate of 2.3% a year but would have to find \u00a312bn a year from tax increases or welfare cuts to do so. Either that or he has to get lucky. The current deficit reduction plans are based on forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility on how much of the damage caused to the economy during the downturn of 2008-09 was permanent rather than temporary. The OBR takes a pessimistic view. Normally, in the period after a recession there are several years in which growth can be above its long-term trend rate of 2.25-2.5% a year without any sign of inflationary pressures developing. That's because there is plenty of spare capacity to use up. But the OBR believes the recession has impaired the supply side of the economy, particularly the financial sector. It thinks the output gap (another way of describing the amount of spare capacity) is just over 2% of GDP, which means the economy can only grow above trend for a short period before inflation starts to be a problem. It is worth pointing out that the OBR's forecasting record has not exactly been unblemished. It was over-optimistic about growth when the economy was flat-lining, and it may be too gloomy now. If it is, and a larger chunk of the loss of output during the recession proves to be temporary, the economy will be able to grow above trend for longer. By the time the output gap has been closed, the higher tax revenues from stronger growth will have reduced the size of the budget deficit and there will not be the need for so much austerity. But let's assume the OBR is right. What happens then? Well, Osborne made his intentions clear last week when he announced fresh cuts in departmental spending and a cap on all welfare payments other than pensions and jobseekers' benefits. He clearly has no intention of raising taxes. Indeed, the autumn statement includes plenty of giveaways \u2013 on fuel duties, marriage allowances and school meals \u2013 that will have to be funded out of smaller Whitehall budgets. And while Osborne likes to draw a distinction between \"scroungers\" and \"hard-working families\", the fact is that many of these hard-working families rely on welfare \u2013 in the form of in-work benefits \u2013 to top up their poverty wages. The autumn statement provided a taste of what is to come when it froze work allowances for three years, the amount low-paid workers can earn before their benefits are withdrawn. This will save Osborne \u00a3600m a year but make poor families poorer. This is quite a contrast from the last Labour government, which introduced the minimum wage and tax credits to help those on low earnings. The impact is well illustrated in a new paper by Christoph Lakner and Branko Milanovic, which looks at global income distribution from the fall of the Berlin wall to the Great Recession. The study found that since the late 1980s, there has been a small fall in global inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient. (If everybody currently living on the planet had the same purchasing power Gini would be zero; if one person enjoyed all the riches Gini would be 100). But the fall has been modest with the two-point decline in the Gini to 70.5 almost entirely due to the growth of the middle class in China. It disappears completely once the authors make allowance for the under-reporting of the incomes of the rich. Lakner and Milanovic also look at those groups that did not fare well in the two decades from 1988 to 2008. This includes the poorest in the US but not the UK, where the 10% of the population on the lowest incomes did almost as well in terms of annual income growth as the Chinese middle class. For this Gordon Brown deserves credit. Osborne says Labour lost control of public spending. He wants \"a government that lives within its means, in a country that pays its way in the world\". His way of ensuring that the books balance involves pouring money into property speculation rather than productive investment, and by locking the UK into a low-productivity, low-investment, low-wage economy in which poverty rises and public services deteriorate. Polls suggest voters are unhappy about falling living standards. Like Ed Miliband, they think this is a dead end. They are, though, yet to be convinced that the opposition has a better plan.",

      "bodyText": "Grocery giants and independents rarely agree on anything, but when it comes to business rates they speak with a single voice: they say it's an unfair tax on high street operators and a major overhaul is long overdue. Last week, in his autumn statement, George Osborne insisted he had been listening, and announced a series of measures to help lift the burden and reinvigorate UK high streets at the same time. The chancellor limited the increase in business rates to 2% \u2013 an inflation-linked 3.2% increase had been looming. He also slashed by \u00a31,000 the amount paid by businesses with rateable values up to \u00a350,000, and halved rates for retailers opening in vacant properties. \"We're backing Britain's businesses all the way,\" he said. But for most, the measures are too little, too late, and will be of limited help for \"bricks-and-mortar\" retailers. Simon Thomas of Moorfields Corporate Recovery, the administrator for doomed video chain Blockbuster, said: \"If the chancellor continues to delay the review of business rates until 2017 [when it is due] it will be too much for the sector to bear. We are confident that by stimulating retail activity across the country the exchequer would increase the direct and indirect tax take.\" Blockbuster was felled by online competition, but it complained that business rates amounted to 10% of its turnover. Thomas added that the tax break for retailers occupying empty premises could also have unfortunate results: \"It is open to a lot of abuse. There are lots of landlords with empty properties and who are trying to avoid paying rates, and there is an industry out there trying to find ways to do that.\" Landlords could, he said, drop rents for retailers that hop between properties to qualify for the reduction, while stalwarts of the local high street suffer. The key problem is that business rates are normally set every five years, using a formula based on the premises' rental value \u2013 but the last review was in 2010 and used figures from early 2008. Since then, rents outside London have plunged, as closures swept Britain's high streets. But the government has delayed the 2015 review for two years, leaving struggling shops paying rates based on boom-time rents \u2013 and their online rivals paying relatively little because they don't have a high street presence. Sainsbury's boss Justin King has been battling to make the burden of business rates known, pointing out that the government's loudly trumpeted corporation tax reductions have been entirely wiped out \u2013 and more \u2013 by other taxes: \"For every \u00a31 we have benefited from the reduction in corporation tax we have incurred more than \u00a32 of other taxes, in particular business rates.\" Campaigners had called for a two-year freeze on business rates to allow time for an overhaul of a system that ratchets up costs automatically. This would have cost the Treasury \u00a31.7bn. Osborne has said he will consider changes for the 2017 revaluation, but retailers argue that that may be too late, with 18 shops closing each day. Richard Rose of accountants BDO said: \"It's an iniquitous system because rates have been increasing throughout the recession, when rents and profits have been going down. It's a substantial tax and the government isn't prepared to let go of it, irrespective of its impact on retailers.\" John Rogers, Sainsbury's finance director, said the matter could not wait, because high streets are threatened with irreversible decline: \"Business rates continue to place a significant and unfair burden on bricks-and-mortar retailers in the UK and are discouraging investment in local jobs and communities.\" What retailers really want is a new tax on shops' revenues or a system of yearly revaluations. Either would link rates more closely to the business's fortunes. Britain relies on business rates more than any other country in the European Union. They are equivalent to 1.6% of output in the UK, compared with 0.3% in Germany and 0.5% in France. BDO's Rose said overseas retailers might think twice about opening in the UK when they could opt for Germany. Julian Dunkerton, chief executive of fashion business SuperGroup, has said high rates would make him open shops overseas instead of in Britain. Shop owner Paul Turner-Mitchell, who contributed to the recent Grimsey Report on the high street, said: \"We are moving new shops and potential employment overseas, yet the chancellor says we have the most competitive taxation in the world.\" The chancellor's problem is that business rates are a big source of revenue, bringing in \u00a326.5bn last year. But retailers argue that cutting the overall take from business rates would stem the tide of closures and encourage expansion, so the government would bring in more corporation tax. It would also, they argue, boost employment, taking people off benefits and getting them paying tax. And that, they say, might just slow the attrition on the high streets too.",

      "body": "<p>Enthusiasts for a 21st century British industrial revival have long asked themselves: \"What can we sell to China?\" David Cameron's no-expenses-spared trade junket last week yielded at least one answer: pig semen. Environment minister Owen Paterson, also on the trip, proudly announced a \u00a345m deal under which China's sows will be impregnated with the aforementioned British pork product.</p> <p>If you think there's something faintly desperate (not to mention <em>Thick of It</em>-esque) about Britain's top politicians flying thousands of miles to discuss the procreation of farmyard animals, you'd be right \u2013 and a close reading of the latest snapshot of Britain's economy by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/office-for-budget-responsibility\" title=\"\">Office for Budget Responsibility</a>, published alongside last week's autumn statement, reveals why.</p> <p>When sterling dropped like a stone at the time of the financial crisis, losing more than 20% of its value against the currencies of our major trading partners, economists and politicians \u2013 even those who had never lamented the slow, painful death of large swaths of British manufacturing \u2013 gleefully predicted an export renaissance.</p> <p>Yet as the OBR acknowledged last week, it has repeatedly failed to materialise. They expect Britain's share of world trade to continue declining; and net exports to act as a drag on economic growth this year, to make precisely no contribution in 2014, and boost GDP by just 0.1 percentage points in 2015. Hardly what George Osborne refers to as Britain \"paying its way in the world\".</p> <p>That knotty question of what China's voracious consumers might want to buy from us gives a pretty good idea of the scale of the problem. There's tourism, of course \u2013 Karl Marx's grave, in London's Highgate cemetery, is on many a Chinese itinerary. But that's Britain as a heritage brand\u2013 the same could arguably be said about the draw of our ancient universities \u2013 and cemetery tours are hardly suitable for mass production.</p> <p>Luxury cars are a good bet: China's elite love nothing better than a spot of ostentatious consumption. Overall, the car industry moved into a small trade surplus at the start of 2013, which is to be cheered, and China played its part, consuming more than 8% of British car exports, up from 1.4% in 2008. But a box in the OBR report entitled car consumption and production explains why that's not the route to an export-led revival either.</p> <p>After many years of being swallowed up by overseas buyers, battered by the overvalued pound and hamstrung by the reluctance of the banks to back boring old widget-makers instead of yacht-owning property magnates, Britain's carmakers are better at bolting together bits from abroad than creating products from start to finish.</p> <p>Or as the OBR puts it, even when we successfully export cars, \"the impact on GDP is limited, as domestic car production uses nearly three times more imports for every pound of output than the economy as a whole. So while \u2026 car trade in isolation has helped reduce the UK's trade deficit, the overall effect on the economy has been less positive.\"</p> <p>The other prize industry much talked about during last week's trip was banking. Unlikely as it seems, given the near-daily diet of revelations about rate-fixing, mis-selling and other scandals, the City appears to be the front-runner to be the major offshore trading centre for the yuan. That should help Britain to sell other financial services too; but it is hardly in the spirit of a \"march of the makers\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, another sorry chapter in the OBR's report told of the latest postponement of the upturn in business investment it has repeatedly predicted since 2010. Whether it's because of financing constraints or consumer confidence, business investment is more than 25% lower than in 2008, and has continued to fall this year. The OBR now expects it to bounce back, by 5.5%, in 2014, and grow at a healthy clip thereafter. We'd better hope it's right: without investing, it's hard to see how businesses can diversify and seek out new markets \u2013 and for Cameron and co, cheering the sale of another batch of pig semen may be as good as it gets.</p> <h2>Someone's coining it <br></h2> <p>Bitcoin is not a currency \u2013 it is a bubble, says Alan Greenspan. Indeed, one dictionary definition of currency is a system of money in general use in a particular country, and bitcoin was created to be stateless. Proposed by a mysterious mathematician calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, the digital phenomenon is above all a beautifully calculated social experiment.</p> <p>Bitcoins are \"mined\", or created, in blocks of 50 and distributed to collectives as a reward for using their combined computer processing power to solve increasingly complex algorithms. These create a log recording the growth and distribution of bitcoin.</p> <p>Satoshi formed the first digital coins using the clay of his own computing power, then vanished into the clouds to watch his creation populate the earth. Satoshi decreed that only 21m Bitcoins could be created, and so far there are 12m. But the coins are divisible, by up to eight decimal places. The smallest unit is called a Satoshi, and 2.1 quadrillion (that's 14 zeros) of them could eventually exist, said to be sufficient for the Satoshi to become global currency.</p> <p>And bitcoin's value is growing. In 12 months its value has risen from $14 a coin to more than $1,000. No one knows who Satoshi is, but he is now a billionaire: records show he retained 1.2m coins, known as the genesis block.</p> <p>Greenspan says bitcoin has no intrinsic value and is not issued by entities who can be trusted. People whose work helped create bitcoin, such as IT engineer Gavin Andresen, counter that its worth lies in freedom from often unfair state control. It can be exchanged for real money and offers the ability to instantly, and at very low cost, pay anybody in the world.</p> <p>The virtual currency spiked when it was used to smuggle money out of Cyprus earlier this year, and its use is spreading in China, where official foreign exchange controls are draconian.</p> <p>To misquote the science fiction writer William Gibson, the future of money is already here and it is becoming more evenly distributed.</p> <h2>Rewards for snitching are too great</h2> <p>The Libor scandal is still casting a long shadow over the financial sector. The European commission last week imposed \u00a31.4bn of fines on six companies for colluding in fixing the key Euribor and yen Libor rate benchmarks.</p> <p>A painful price. But one that could have been much more punishing if the Swiss bank UBS, which blew the whistle on the cartel that was rigging yen Libor, had not escaped its \u00a32.1bn fine as a reward for alerting the authorities to the scandal. Barclays similarly dodged a \u00a3570m fine for confessing to the rigging of another benchmark.</p> <p>For turning supergrass, the two banks received total immunity from any fines. This compares very nicely with the banks' dealings with the Financial Services Authority, which granted Barclays a 30% reduction in its fine for Libor-rigging and UBS a more stingy 20% reduction.</p> <p>The prospect of a 100% discount may well have helped motivate the two banks' decision to shout loudly to Europe's competition watchdog, but surely this is not the way to handle such cases of widespread wrongdoing.</p> <p>The banks profited \u2013 or intended to profit \u2013 from their collusion in rigging rates. Even if they then point the finger at others, they should still be made to pay the major part of the fine they would have faced.</p>",

They expect Britain's share of world trade to continue declining; and net exports to act as a drag on economic growth this year, to make precisely no contribution in 2014, and boost GDP by just 0.1 percentage points in 2015. Hardly what George Osborne refers to as Britain \"paying its way in the world\". That knotty question of what China's voracious consumers might want to buy from us gives a pretty good idea of the scale of the problem. There's tourism, of course \u2013 Karl Marx's grave, in London's Highgate cemetery, is on many a Chinese itinerary. But that's Britain as a heritage brand\u2013 the same could arguably be said about the draw of our ancient universities \u2013 and cemetery tours are hardly suitable for mass production. Luxury cars are a good bet: China's elite love nothing better than a spot of ostentatious consumption. Overall, the car industry moved into a small trade surplus at the start of 2013, which is to be cheered, and China played its part, consuming more than 8% of British car exports, up from 1.4% in 2008. But a box in the OBR report entitled car consumption and production explains why that's not the route to an export-led revival either. After many years of being swallowed up by overseas buyers, battered by the overvalued pound and hamstrung by the reluctance of the banks to back boring old widget-makers instead of yacht-owning property magnates, Britain's carmakers are better at bolting together bits from abroad than creating products from start to finish. Or as the OBR puts it, even when we successfully export cars, \"the impact on GDP is limited, as domestic car production uses nearly three times more imports for every pound of output than the economy as a whole. So while \u2026 car trade in isolation has helped reduce the UK's trade deficit, the overall effect on the economy has been less positive.\" The other prize industry much talked about during last week's trip was banking. Unlikely as it seems, given the near-daily diet of revelations about rate-fixing, mis-selling and other scandals, the City appears to be the front-runner to be the major offshore trading centre for the yuan. That should help Britain to sell other financial services too; but it is hardly in the spirit of a \"march of the makers\". Meanwhile, another sorry chapter in the OBR's report told of the latest postponement of the upturn in business investment it has repeatedly predicted since 2010. Whether it's because of financing constraints or consumer confidence, business investment is more than 25% lower than in 2008, and has continued to fall this year. The OBR now expects it to bounce back, by 5.5%, in 2014, and grow at a healthy clip thereafter. We'd better hope it's right: without investing, it's hard to see how businesses can diversify and seek out new markets \u2013 and for Cameron and co, cheering the sale of another batch of pig semen may be as good as it gets. Someone's coining it Bitcoin is not a currency \u2013 it is a bubble, says Alan Greenspan. Indeed, one dictionary definition of currency is a system of money in general use in a particular country, and bitcoin was created to be stateless. Proposed by a mysterious mathematician calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, the digital phenomenon is above all a beautifully calculated social experiment. Bitcoins are \"mined\", or created, in blocks of 50 and distributed to collectives as a reward for using their combined computer processing power to solve increasingly complex algorithms. These create a log recording the growth and distribution of bitcoin. Satoshi formed the first digital coins using the clay of his own computing power, then vanished into the clouds to watch his creation populate the earth. Satoshi decreed that only 21m Bitcoins could be created, and so far there are 12m. But the coins are divisible, by up to eight decimal places. The smallest unit is called a Satoshi, and 2.1 quadrillion (that's 14 zeros) of them could eventually exist, said to be sufficient for the Satoshi to become global currency. And bitcoin's value is growing. In 12 months its value has risen from $14 a coin to more than $1,000. No one knows who Satoshi is, but he is now a billionaire: records show he retained 1.2m coins, known as the genesis block. Greenspan says bitcoin has no intrinsic value and is not issued by entities who can be trusted. People whose work helped create bitcoin, such as IT engineer Gavin Andresen, counter that its worth lies in freedom from often unfair state control. It can be exchanged for real money and offers the ability to instantly, and at very low cost, pay anybody in the world. The virtual currency spiked when it was used to smuggle money out of Cyprus earlier this year, and its use is spreading in China, where official foreign exchange controls are draconian. To misquote the science fiction writer William Gibson, the future of money is already here and it is becoming more evenly distributed. Rewards for snitching are too great The Libor scandal is still casting a long shadow over the financial sector. The European commission last week imposed \u00a31.4bn of fines on six companies for colluding in fixing the key Euribor and yen Libor rate benchmarks. A painful price. But one that could have been much more punishing if the Swiss bank UBS, which blew the whistle on the cartel that was rigging yen Libor, had not escaped its \u00a32.1bn fine as a reward for alerting the authorities to the scandal. Barclays similarly dodged a \u00a3570m fine for confessing to the rigging of another benchmark. For turning supergrass, the two banks received total immunity from any fines. This compares very nicely with the banks' dealings with the Financial Services Authority, which granted Barclays a 30% reduction in its fine for Libor-rigging and UBS a more stingy 20% reduction. The prospect of a 100% discount may well have helped motivate the two banks' decision to shout loudly to Europe's competition watchdog, but surely this is not the way to handle such cases of widespread wrongdoing. The banks profited \u2013 or intended to profit \u2013 from their collusion in rigging rates. Even if they then point the finger at others, they should still be made to pay the major part of the fine they would have faced.",

      "bodyText": "Two centuries after he dreamed of digging beneath the sea to reach his island nemesis to the north, Napoleon Bonaparte might have been surprised to see Paris and London linked so harmoniously by a sleek, silver train. But he would have been less surprised to learn that the British, that nation of shopkeepers, are set to flog off their share of the pioneering service. The decision to sell the nation's stake in Eurostar, just under two decades since Queen Elizabeth chugged down the tracks from Waterloo before speeding through the French countryside with President Mitterrand, was confirmed this week by the financial secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, as part of the updated infrastructure plan. The sell-off, first mooted by the coalition in 2010, was part of a doubled target for state asset sales to \u00a320bn. Eurostar, for all its significance, will form a tiny fraction of that. The majority 55% French stake is owned by the state-controlled SNCF, Britain has 40% via state-owned London &amp; Continental Railways, and 5% is owned by Belgian state railways. Analysts suggest the British stake will fetch around \u00a3120m-\u00a3200m, or 0.2%-0.4% of the price of HS2. After the accusations of undervaluing the privatised Royal Mail, ministers will be anxious about the price. A happier memory is the sale of Eurostar's effective landlord, HS1 \u2013 the company created to run the British high-speed link to St Pancras, a track finally built 13 years after Eurostar started services. HS1 was sold to Canadian investors for \u00a32.1bn, 20% above estimates. The government will soon start appointing advisers to run the sale, on a broad timeline to conclude by 2020. But the City view is that this may only attract one bidder: SNCF. Gerald Khoo, transport analyst at Liberum Capital, says: \"Realistically, there's only one obvious buyer: the owner of the 55%. Theoretically you might get someone who wants in, but a stake of something someone else owns and controls doesn't appeal to that many people. And if you've only got one buyer, you get the worst price.\" The limited figures published by Eurostar suggest that, despite historically falling short of forecast passenger numbers, it pulls in solid returns on an effective monopoly. With revenues around \u00a3800m and profits for 2012 doubling to \u00a353m, the profit margin of 6.5% appears handsomely above that of domestic train operators. The limited data makes analysts loth to put a price on the stake, although one suggests a figure in the low hundreds of millions. Douglas McNeill, investment director at Charles Stanley, takes a punt at \u00a3500m-\u00a3700m for the company overall, which owns its rolling stock and has net cash in the bank. For a minority stake, Britain could expect a little less than the value of the 40% it owns. He rules out any UK transport groups bidding, saying: \"You'd think SNCF was the prime contender. Otherwise, I'd look more towards private equity firms or infrastructure funds. It's a utility-type business that ought to be able to deliver unspectacular but steady returns over time.\" Its effective monopoly will end when Deutsche Bahn also starts running trains through the tunnel. While a target date of 2016 has been mentioned, the German rail operator is understood not to have ordered trains yet, making that look likely to slip. Eurostar claims their arrival can only help. Mary Walsh, its communications director, says: \"We'd welcome competition \u2013 it helps grow the market overall by transforming consumer perception.\" That perception will also be helped by Eurostar's decision to bid for the East Coast rail franchise with Keolis \u2013 raising the intriguing prospect of Eurostar from Edinburgh to Paris and beyond. Even if the French bid is successful, the east coast service won't be branded Eurostar, but the firm believes its experience in service for both business and leisure passengers puts it in good stead for a new train franchise. Walsh says: \"All these initiatives help foster enthusiasm for greater connectivity, and change the mindset that you can travel by train rather than plane at higher speeds over longer distances.\" Eurostar has raised \u00a3700m to overhaul and expand its existing fleet, and is stretching its routes to the Swiss Alps, Provence and \u2013 by 2016 \u2013 direct to Amsterdam, including a stop at the Air France-KLM hub of Schiphol airport. Having initially suffered a drop in passenger figures when budget flying took off, making it cheaper for Brits to fly to distant reaches of the continent than travel by rail to Paris, Eurostar may find new markets as a feeder to long-haul aviation. In short, things look relatively rosy. So should the government cash in? Unions are opposed. The RMT's Bob Crow says it's typical that the government is \"prepared to flog off the valuable public stake in Eurostar just as this expanding and important service is moving into a new period of growth\". Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, says: \"The coalition sold this country short on the Royal Mail and it's going to sell this country short on Eurostar.\" And would the French ever countenance selling? A spokesman for SNCF says: \"No! In a hundred years, maybe. The British may be retreating; but for the French, it's really the contrary. Eurostar is a real success story for SNCF. We're in there for the long term.\"",

      "bodyText": "Just off the M1 near Leeds, there's a British-owned company that turns out 300 sports and racing cars a year. The perfect boys' toys, they will set you back up to \u00a3240,000. The company is Ginetta, and its boss, Lawrence Tomlinson, 49, points out a sporty number that would be just right for the banker with a big bonus to spend: \"This is the thing we're launching for the City boys. Our line is: don't waste your bonus on a Porsche; come and join the Ginetta racing drivers' club.\" It is perhaps an unusual sales pitch for a businessman who has been portrayed as a champion of small firms and a basher of banks. But Tomlinson's explosive allegation that Royal Bank of Scotland is forcing viable businesses to the wall for its own profit sent shockwaves around the bank, sparked a regulatory inquiry and aroused the interest of the Serious Fraud Office. The allegation is that the bailed-out bank has been moving commercial borrowers into its global restructuring group (GRG), which handles loans classed as risky and charges higher fees and interest rates. Firms that subsequently collapse will, it is alleged, then see RBS's distressed debt subsidiary, West Register, buy up their properties. RBS argues the allegations are unproven but have been very damaging. Tomlinson says the complaints follow a pattern: customers find their properties valued lower than the purchase price and are put into GRG, where they are charged management fees and higher interest. The individual is then asked for personal guarantees, and soon after the business goes into administration. Revelations that Tomlinson has a dispute of his own with RBS have added to the controversy. But sitting in his office \u2013 black leather sofa, bookshelves covered in racing memorabilia, fridge stocked with champagne and wine \u2013 Tomlinson insists he is not on a personal crusade. He wants to give embattled small businesses a voice: \"I'm not out to bash RBS. I'm out to try to get a fair deal for businesses and to help the bank understand what is happening at the coalface.\" His base in Garforth, in a former coal mining area, has become a popular stop-off point for politicians seeking domestic manufacturing success stories. The cars \u2013 which have been driven by Nigel Mansell and which the whippet-thin Tomlinson has driven in the Le Mans 24-hour race \u2013 are designed and assembled on site. His office overlooks the workshop where Ford engines are adapted, car frames are welded and carbon fibre moulded. Vince Cable, for whose business department Tomlinson is an entrepreneur-in-residence, is among those to have visited. The business secretary has given his support to Tomlinson, whose report is now with the Financial Conduct Authority and the SFO. Tomlinson says RBS should have suspended those facing the allegations. Tomlinson says: \"I haven't had one person say to me: 'I had a great experience in GRG. They really helped me turn around my business.' What I have had is absolutely appalling negative comments about it.\" His own dispute with RBS, over two of its staff members, is not relevant, he says, as he is not in GRG. But other businesses should not be there either, he says. \"In the cases I'm looking at, people are paying back interest and capital and not missing payments. These are not people who are defaulting on loans.\" While the Garforth car workshop is the most visible part of Tomlinson's business, it is not the only one. His eponymous LNT Group \u2013 the N is for his middle name, Neil \u2013 also builds and runs care homes, supplies software for care home businesses and manufactures items such as a wing de-icer for aircraft. The latest accounts show bank fees amounting to \u00a32.6m, incurred when the business agreed a \u00a3100m refinancing on 28 March. There is a \u00a34m overdraft \u2013 with RBS subsidiary NatWest \u2013 and a \u00a373.7m loan and \u00a322.3m for land development with NatWest, Santander, Clydesdale and Bank Leumi. All will be up for renegotiation in September 2014. Tomlinson has personally lent the loss-making group \u00a327m. \"I will always back my business for growth,\" he says. A property company he and his wife run has lent a further \u00a310m, while a subsidiary of LNT Group recently sold a \u00a31.2m helicopter to a company Tomlinson has an interest in. He is a busy man, claiming to get by on five hours' sleep a night, and the helicopter will be for personal use. A mechanical engineering graduate, Tomlinson started importing speedboats and cars from the US in his early twenties before getting into care homes at 23, when he borrowed \u00a3526,000 to buy a home that his parents had been running. This eventually became Orchard Homes, which was sold in 2007 \u2013 \"a good time to sell a business\" \u2013 and he gave \u00a39m to his staff. He set up Ideal Care Homes in 2009. Staff have stakes in the new company and the boardroom \u2013 where the table converts into a pool table \u2013 displays a line of champagne bottles opened on the day of the distribution. Private Eye recently lambasted him for using a tax avoidance scheme in 2002. It was the result of \"rubbish advice\", says Tomlinson, adding that he regrets doing it. More recently he paid \u00a36m in personal tax: \"That would be a bloody nice boat in Monaco. I'd only have to stay there nine months.\" He warned his wife and four children that there might be some publicity when his report was published 10 days ago, but insists the project is not about him. It is about giving a voice to those who have been \"financially abused\". Tomlinson, who has been contacted by at least 250 people since publication, also says he has omitted from his report those businesses that were failing anyway. His ideal would be for firms to get the treatment he did, as a 23-year-old asking for his first loan. Sitting at his desk in Garforth, he says: \"If I hadn't had a brilliant bank manager at the Midland Bank \u2013 he backed me because he knew me \u2013 none of this would be here. You find me a bank now that would have backed me to do what I've done.\"",

But Tomlinson's explosive allegation that Royal Bank of Scotland is forcing viable businesses to the wall for its own profit sent shockwaves around the bank, sparked a regulatory inquiry and aroused the interest of the Serious Fraud Office.</p> <p>The allegation is that the bailed-out bank has been moving commercial borrowers into its global restructuring group (GRG), which handles loans classed as risky and charges higher fees and interest rates. Firms that subsequently collapse will, it is alleged, then see RBS's distressed debt subsidiary, West Register, buy up their properties. RBS argues the allegations are unproven but have been very damaging.</p> <p>Tomlinson says the complaints follow a pattern: customers find their properties valued lower than the purchase price and are put into GRG, where they are charged management fees and higher interest. The individual is then asked for personal guarantees, and soon after the business goes into administration.</p> <p>Revelations that Tomlinson has a dispute of his own with RBS have added to the controversy. But sitting in his office \u2013 black leather sofa, bookshelves covered in racing memorabilia, fridge stocked with champagne and wine \u2013 Tomlinson insists he is not on a personal crusade. He wants to give embattled small businesses a voice: \"I'm not out to bash RBS. I'm out to try to get a fair deal for businesses and to help the bank understand what is happening at the coalface.\"</p> <p>His base in Garforth, in a former coal mining area, has become a popular stop-off point for politicians seeking domestic manufacturing success stories. The cars \u2013 which have been driven by Nigel Mansell and which the whippet-thin Tomlinson has driven in the Le Mans 24-hour race \u2013 are designed and assembled on site. His office overlooks the workshop where Ford engines are adapted, car frames are welded and carbon fibre moulded.</p> <p>Vince Cable, for whose business department Tomlinson is an entrepreneur-in-residence, is among those to have visited. The business secretary has given his support to Tomlinson, whose report is now with the Financial Conduct Authority and the SFO. Tomlinson says RBS should have suspended those facing the allegations.</p> <p>Tomlinson says: \"I haven't had one person say to me: 'I had a great experience in GRG. They really helped me turn around my business.' What I have had is absolutely appalling negative comments about it.\"</p> <p>His own dispute with RBS, over two of its staff members, is not relevant, he says, as he is not in GRG. But other businesses should not be there either, he says. \"In the cases I'm looking at, people are paying back interest and capital and not missing payments. These are not people who are defaulting on loans.\"</p> <p>While the Garforth car workshop is the most visible part of Tomlinson's business, it is not the only one. His eponymous LNT Group \u2013 the N is for his middle name, Neil \u2013 also builds and runs care homes, supplies software for care home businesses and manufactures items such as a wing de-icer for aircraft.</p> <p>The latest accounts show bank fees amounting to \u00a32.6m, incurred when the business agreed a \u00a3100m refinancing on 28 March. There is a \u00a34m overdraft \u2013 with RBS subsidiary NatWest \u2013 and a \u00a373.7m loan and \u00a322.3m for land development with NatWest, Santander, Clydesdale and Bank Leumi. All will be up for renegotiation in September 2014.</p> <p>Tomlinson has personally lent the loss-making group \u00a327m. \"I will always back my business for growth,\" he says. A property company he and his wife run has lent a further \u00a310m, while a subsidiary of LNT Group recently sold a \u00a31.2m helicopter to a company Tomlinson has an interest in. He is a busy man, claiming to get by on five hours' sleep a night, and the helicopter will be for personal use.</p> <p>A mechanical engineering graduate, Tomlinson started importing speedboats and cars from the US in his early twenties before getting into care homes at 23, when he borrowed \u00a3526,000 to buy a home that his parents had been running. This eventually became Orchard Homes, which was sold in 2007 \u2013 \"a good time to sell a business\" \u2013 and he gave \u00a39m to his staff. He set up Ideal Care Homes in 2009. Staff have stakes in the new company and the boardroom \u2013 where the table converts into a pool table \u2013 displays a line of champagne bottles opened on the day of the distribution.</p> <p><em>Private Eye</em> recently lambasted him for using a tax avoidance scheme in 2002. It was the result of \"rubbish advice\", says Tomlinson, adding that he regrets doing it. More recently he paid \u00a36m in personal tax: \"That would be a bloody nice boat in Monaco. I'd only have to stay there nine months.\"</p> <p>He warned his wife and four children that there might be some publicity when his report was published 10 days ago, but insists the project is not about him. It is about giving a voice to those who have been \"financially abused\". Tomlinson, who has been contacted by at least 250 people since publication, also says he has omitted from his report those businesses that were failing anyway.</p> <p>His ideal would be for firms to get the treatment he did, as a 23-year-old asking for his first loan. Sitting at his desk in Garforth, he says: \"If I hadn't had a brilliant bank manager at the Midland Bank \u2013 he backed me because he knew me \u2013 none of this would be here. You find me a bank now that would have backed me to do what I've done.\"</p>",
