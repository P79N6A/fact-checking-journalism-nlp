Speaking in London ahead of the Bank\u2019s spring meeting next week, Jim Yong Kim said an urgent development push was needed in order to meet the demands for a better life by those in developing countries, increasingly aware through their smartphones of how rich people lived. The Bank is particularly worried about recent low growth in Africa and Kim said official aid money should be used to turn the billions of dollars provided by western countries into trillions of dollars of investment from the private sector. \u201cAspirations, linked to opportunity, can breed dynamism and inclusive, sustainable economic growth,\u201d Kim said, in a speech at the London School of Economics on Tuesday. \u201cBut I worry that if there\u2019s no opportunity to achieve these aspirations, frustration may well lead to fragility, conflict, violence and eventually migration. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing worrying trends \u2013 2 billion people live in countries affected by fragility, conflict and violence. After a period of decline since the end of the Cold War, violent conflicts have increased rapidly since 2010. Terrorism incidents have increased by 120% since 2012.\u201d Kim said that an individual\u2019s happiness was linked not just to their own income but also to the incomes of others. As internet coverage had expanded, the comparison was increasingly with people in rich countries. \u201cKeeping up with the Joneses used to be about keeping up with your neighbours. But it\u2019s no longer only about the Joneses living around you \u2013 because of connectivity, the Joneses could be anywhere in the world.\u201d Kim said creating the right conditions for the private sector to invest was vital if the world was to meet the ambitious sustainable development goals by the target date of 2030. The World Bank president believes that too much official aid has been spent on projects that the private sector could finance, and that instead of picking \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d official development assistance should be spent in more difficult areas. He said the top priority should be to \u201csystematically de-risk countries to enable private sector financing, while at the same time ensuring that these investments benefit poor countries and poor people. We should do this by crowding in the private sector whenever possible.\u201d Kim added that he wanted a \u201cwin-win\u201d outcome, where the trillions of dollars earning little interest were used to fund projects such as solar power and transport infrastructure. Investors looking for more lucrative opportunities should be mobilised to help meet the \u201cexploding aspirations\u201d of people all over the world. \u201cThis is a fundamental shift in our conception of who we are,\u201d Kim said. \u201cFor too long, our first thought was how can we get the loan or the grant out of the door? But that\u2019s often not what\u2019s best for poor people and poor countries, and it\u2019s not what\u2019s best for the world. We need to have a different and difficult conversation about how we approach development finance.\u201d He singled out climate change as an area where urgent action was needed. He said time was running out and joint public-private action on both mitigating the impact of climate change and adapting to the changing environment was required immediately.",

      "bodyText": "Airline passengers beware: when you buy a ticket, you are not only subjecting yourself to the ordeals of security queues, baggage limits and turbulence. You are also signing a near-40,000-word contract with a carrier that, in the extreme case of a United Airlines passenger on 9 April, could have you hauled off an overbooked aircraft \u2013 legally \u2013 as fellow customers and a global web audience look on aghast. Sunday\u2019s extraordinary scenes on a Chicago, Illinois, to Louisville, Kentucky, flight unfolded because of two regulations that are standard practice across the industry. The first says a passenger can be barred from a flight if the number of customers with tickets exceeds the number of seats. The second says the captain can have you removed from the plane if you get emotional about it. Air travel is a thicket of regulations and acronyms that, of course, have your safety at heart. But there can be a thin line between guaranteeing your security and dragging a seemingly innocent passenger off an overbooked aircraft. Flight overbooking is a phenomenon born of an industry that has struggled historically to make money. Indeed, airlines lost nearly $50bn (\u00a340bn) in the past decade due to a combination of the 9/11 attacks, high oil prices and the credit crunch. The sector is making money now, but profits are slender \u2013 $9.89 per passenger per journey \u2013 so taking a risk and selling 183 tickets for a 180-seater plane is worth it if three of those passengers fail to turn up and you can pocket their fare expenditure as pure profit. \u201cAirlines have very large fixed costs, so if they don\u2019t fill the plane past a certain point they will lose money. They know a certain proportion of these passengers will not show, so they need to overbook to get to break-even or better,\u201d says Brian Pearce, the chief economist of the industry\u2019s trade body, the International Air Transport Association. The contract of carriage at United \u2013 the conditions to which you agree when you buy a ticket \u2013 comes in at 37,000 words and embraces a range of arcane treaties and rules, from the Montreal and Warsaw conventions to FARs, the US\u2019s federal aviation regulations. According to one legal expert, United was acting within its rights as the furore unfolded when it tried to find seats for four crew who needed to reach a plane they were due to operate in Louisville. But such a calamitous collision of passenger rights and airline prerogative is unlikely. \u201cIt is a very rare set of circumstances,\u201d says Kevin Clarke, a flight-delay specialist at UK law firm Bott &amp; Co. Pointing out that US airlines usually seek, and find, volunteers to come off full flights in exchange for compensation, he adds: \u201cIt can be a question of who backs down first.\u201d In the case of this United flight, the passenger certainly didn\u2019t. United\u2019s contract of carriage is a joyless tour of one of the world\u2019s most over-regulated industries, where a minority of colourful terms \u2013 \u201cacts of God\u201d; \u201ccivil commotions\u201d \u2013 is crowded out by tightly worded legalese that will stop you from taking any future journey for granted (at least on United). Under rule five, covering \u201ccancellations of reservations\u201d, the passenger is warned that all flights are \u201csubject to overbooking\u201d, which could result in the airline being unable to put the passenger on the flight. In that scenario \u2013 please bear with this \u2013 rule 25, on passengers denied boarding compensation, kicks in. Using language that inadvertently acknowledges the confrontation inherent in the situation, it states that, if no passengers agree voluntarily to give up their seats in exchange for compensation, \u201cother passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily\u201d. Admittedly, there is recompense of about $1,000 available in this scenario, but it appears that the United passenger in this case said no. This brought him head to head with the far tougher rule, enshrined under the 1963 Tokyo Convention, that says the captain\u2019s word is law on an airliner and that he or she has \u201cthe ultimate authority\u201d in dealing with any onboard incident. Rule 21 of United\u2019s contract states that removal of a passenger may be necessary if their conduct is deemed to be \u201cdisorderly, offensive, abusive or violent\u201d. It appears that the Louisville-bound passenger refused to give up his seat voluntarily and the crew deemed his behaviour to be out of line, prompting them to call in the security team at Chicago O\u2019Hare international airport. Speaking to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity, a senior pilot at a major airline said: \u201cThe legal position is that you are not guaranteed to travel and that you must obey any \u2018reasonable commands\u2019 of the crew. So, legally, the airline is right. \u201cIf it were me, I might have sought to promote a different solution [to allow] the crew to travel. I suspect a crew was \u2018out of hours\u2019 [about to exceed its working-hours limit] or sick or injured somewhere else on the network and the decision was therefore a little late to send them on that aircraft. I think the reputational damage from the events on Facebook will be significantly worse than a delay \u2013 even significant \u2013 elsewhere.\u201d Airline professionals are astonished that United\u2019s overbooking procedures, in a market where overbooking is prevalent, resulted in a passenger being allowed to board before they were subsequently dragged off. John Strickland, an industry consultant whose career has included managing the overbooking process at a major airline, says carriers now have sophisticated computer systems that calibrate whether flights can get away with being overbooked \u2013 right down to the specific route, the time of day and whether demand will surge due to holidays or special events. However, he adds: \u201cIt is not a perfect science, which means when it goes wrong it needs to be handled sensitively.\u201d This is where United, a so-called full-service airline that tries to offer a level of customer service superior to that of budget rivals, could suffer lasting reputational damage. At the end of rule 25, United states: \u201cUA shall not be liable for any punitive, consequential or special damages arising out of or in connection with UA\u2019s failure to provide the passenger with confirmed reserved space.\u201d Best of luck with that one, United. An argument in favour of airline laws is what happens when they disappear. In the UK, compensation for delays caused by overbooking is covered by a regulation called EU 261/2004. According to industry lore, it came into fruition when MEPs grew exasperated with being bumped from flights to Brussels and Strasbourg. But airline passenger compensation could be one of the items of red tape that will be lobbed into the Brexit bonfire come EU independence day. One of the unintended consequences of severing links with Brussels, and abandoning EU 261/2004, is that passengers flying from the UK could be exposed when we say goodbye to the single market. \u201cThere is the possibility that we adopt the principles of the regulation [after leaving the EU],\u201d says Bott and Co\u2019s Clarke. \u201cBut it is a possibility that we will be left without that protection. The obligation to put you on an alternative flight, the entitlement to compensation, that would not be there. You could be left stranded.\u201d Another reason for Michael Gove and his fellow Brexiters to stick to the staycation.",

The first says a passenger can be barred from a flight if the number of customers with tickets exceeds the number of seats. The second says the captain can have you removed from the plane if you get emotional about it.</p> <p>Air travel is a thicket of regulations and acronyms that, of course, have your safety at heart. But there can be a thin line between guaranteeing your security and dragging a seemingly innocent passenger off an overbooked aircraft.</p> <p>Flight overbooking is a phenomenon born of an industry that has struggled historically to make money. Indeed, airlines lost nearly $50bn (\u00a340bn) in the past decade due to a combination of the 9/11 attacks, high oil prices and the credit crunch. The sector is making money now, but profits are slender \u2013 $9.89 per passenger per journey \u2013 so taking a risk and selling 183 tickets for a 180-seater plane is worth it if three of those passengers fail to turn up and you can pocket their fare expenditure as pure profit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuKtxJsmWgA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZuKtxJsmWgA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/apr/11/united-airlines-passenger-forcibly-removed-from-overbooked-flight-video\">United Airlines passenger forcibly removed from overbooked flight \u2013 video</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cAirlines have very large fixed costs, so if they don\u2019t fill the plane past a certain point they will lose money. They know a certain proportion of these passengers will not show, so they need to overbook to get to break-even or better,\u201d says Brian Pearce, the chief economist of the industry\u2019s trade body, the International Air Transport Association.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/contract-of-carriage.aspx\">contract of carriage at United</a> \u2013 the conditions to which you agree when you buy a ticket \u2013 comes in at 37,000 words and embraces a range of arcane treaties and rules, from <a href=\"http://www.iata.org/policy/Documents/MC99_en.pdf\">the Montreal and Warsaw conventions</a> to FARs, the US\u2019s federal aviation regulations.</p> <p>According to one legal expert, United was acting within its rights as the furore unfolded when it tried to find seats for four crew who needed to reach a plane they were due to operate in Louisville. But such a calamitous collision of passenger rights and airline prerogative is unlikely. \u201cIt is a very rare set of circumstances,\u201d says Kevin Clarke, a flight-delay specialist at UK law firm Bott &amp; Co. Pointing out that US airlines usually seek, and find, volunteers to come off full flights in exchange for compensation, he adds: \u201cIt can be a question of who backs down first.\u201d In the case of this United flight, the passenger certainly didn\u2019t.</p> <p>United\u2019s contract of carriage is a joyless tour of one of the world\u2019s most over-regulated industries, where a minority of colourful terms \u2013 \u201cacts of God\u201d; \u201ccivil commotions\u201d \u2013 is crowded out by tightly worded legalese that will stop you from taking any future journey for granted (at least on United). Under rule five, covering \u201ccancellations of reservations\u201d, the passenger is warned that all flights are \u201csubject to overbooking\u201d, which could result in the airline being unable to put the passenger on the flight. In that scenario \u2013 please bear with this \u2013 rule 25, on passengers denied boarding compensation, kicks in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/11/united-airlines-boss-oliver-munoz-says-passenger-belligerent\">United Airlines CEO calls dragged passenger 'disruptive and belligerent'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Using language that inadvertently acknowledges the confrontation inherent in the situation, it states that, if no passengers agree voluntarily to give up their seats in exchange for compensation, \u201cother passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily\u201d. Admittedly, there is recompense of about $1,000 available in this scenario, but it appears that the United passenger in this case said no. This brought him head to head with the far tougher rule, <a href=\"http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/safety/Documents/Guidance-On-Unruly-Passenger-Prevention-And-Management-1st-Edition.pdf\">enshrined under the 1963 Tokyo Convention</a>, that says the captain\u2019s word is law on an airliner and that he or she has \u201cthe ultimate authority\u201d in dealing with any onboard incident.</p> <p>Rule 21 of United\u2019s contract states that removal of a passenger may be necessary if their conduct is deemed to be \u201cdisorderly, offensive, abusive or violent\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Toshiba, one of the biggest names in consumer electronics, has warned it is facing annual losses of more than \u00a37bn and the future of the company is in doubt as a result of financial turmoil at its nuclear power plant construction business. The Japanese company finally released third quarter results, after twice delaying publication while auditors attempted to quantify the scale of the problems at Toshiba\u2019s US nuclear engineering subsidiary Westinghouse, which filed for bankruptcy last month. Toshiba took the unusual decision to publish them on Tuesday without the approval of auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers Aarata. The company said PwC Aarata had been too uncertain about the financial impact of Westinghouse\u2019s takeover of nuclear construction company CB&amp;I Stone and Webster in 2015. Westinghouse\u2019s plight stems from a $6.1bn (\u00a34.9bn) writedown because costs have overrun on the two plants CB&amp;I is building in Georgia and South Carolina, the first new US nuclear power stations for decades. The unaudited results showed Toshiba\u2019s total losses widened by 53bn yen to 532bn yen (\u00a33.9bn) in the nine months ending December 2016, adding that losses for the full year ending March could amount to more than 1tn yen (\u00a37.3bn). It would be one of the biggest losses in Japanese corporate history. \u201cThere are material events and conditions that raise substantial doubt about the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d the company said in a statement. Failure to file audited results fuelled speculation that the company could be forced out of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Toshiba\u2019s president, Satoshi Tsunakawa, called the auditor\u2019s decision not to approve the figures \u201ctruly regrettable\u201d and said he hoped the company would not be delisted. Toshiba is attempting to strengthen its balance sheet by selling other assets, including its memory chip business. The company\u2019s escalating crisis also heightened fears about the future of Toshiba\u2019s planned Moorside nuclear plant in Cumbria. Earlier this month it was forced to take full control of the venture behind the project, Nugen, after its previous partner, the French utility Engie, exercised the right to sell its 40% stake under an option triggered by Westinghouse\u2019s bankruptcy filing. Unite, Britain\u2019s largest trade union, said it was fearful about what the latest developments at Toshiba would mean for the Moorside plant, and repeated its call on Greg Clark, the business and energy secretary, to intervene to safeguard the future of the project. Kevin Coyne, Unite\u2019s national officer for energy, said: \u201cThe latest news about the very poor financial health of Toshiba raises further concerns about its involvement in the construction of the Moorside nuclear power station in Cumbria. \u201cUnite renews its call to the business secretary, Greg Clark, to step in and pledge public investment to ensure that the project goes ahead on schedule, as Toshiba is in deep financial trouble and has a big question mark over its future.\u201d Coyne said the \u201clights could go out\u201d in the future without a coherent, joined up energy policy, adding Moorside would be crucial. \u201cThe importance of Moorside can\u2019t be underestimated as it is expected to generate 20,000 highly skilled jobs during its construction and when it is up and running \u2013 and also supply 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity needs from 2025,\u201d he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the government was talking to potential investors. \u201cThe UK government is committed to new nuclear as an important part of our energy mix, having commissioned the first new nuclear power plant in a generation at Hinkley Point C,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe NuGen consortium has always planned to bring in other partners to deliver the project and we engage regularly with a range of developers and investors. The secretary of state visited South Korea last week for talks on future collaboration between our two countries, including on potential civil nuclear projects.\u201d In February, Tobisha said its chairman, Shigenori Shiga, was resigning to take \u201cmanagement responsibility\u201d for the writedowns related to Westinghouse.",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has said a Labour government would \u201cdeclare war\u201d on corporations that fail to pay suppliers on time, although the companies he singled out, such as M&amp;S, have said they do not recognise his data. The Labour leader accused large companies, including E.ON, Capita and the BT group, of profiting from the late payments as he vowed to ease regulations on small businesses. But credit check agency Experian said its data should not be seen as a barometer of how fast a company pays its suppliers. \u201cCash is king for any business, and big companies are managing their cash by borrowing \u2013 interest free \u2013 from their suppliers,\u201d the Labour leader told a Federation for Small Business event. \u201cSome of the biggest names in business are holding cash piles that don\u2019t actually belong to them. It\u2019s a national scandal. And it\u2019s stopping businesses from growing and causing thousands to go bust every year. It kills jobs and holds back economic growth.\u201d Labour said Corbyn\u2019s attack on the corporations was based on analysing data from current Experian credit reports, which identified payment beyond terms, normally 30-60 days, by big companies. In the figures quoted by Labour, M&amp;S went 72 days beyond terms, Capita 82 days and the National Grid as long as 119 days. Others mentioned by Corbyn were 89 days for BT and 84 days for Vodafone. Experian said the figures, taken from their report, said the figures only relate to invoices which are settled late and do not take into consideration payments made on time. \u201cThe data relates to how late a business can expect any late payments to be, and not the company\u2019s overall track record on the payment of suppliers,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cIt is intended for indicative purposes only, to inform specific business decisions, and we would not recommend it is used as an overall barometer of how a company pays suppliers.\u201d Almost all the companies named by Corbyn, including M&amp;S, Capita and BT Group, disputed the figures in the speech. An M&amp;S spokesperson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t recognise these numbers at all. Over 99% of our supplier invoices are paid on time and we are signatories to the prompt payment code.\u201d A BT spokesman said the company spent \u00a39.3bn with UK suppliers last year, 40% of which went to small businesses. \u201cDuring 2015/16 the average number of days between BT being invoiced and payment to UK suppliers was 54 days, well below the figures claimed in this report, which we do not recognise,\u201d the spokesman said. Capita said it did not recognise the figures either and said 90% of invoices were paid within 30 days of receipt. A National Grid spokesman said the company was a signatory to the prompt payment code and \u201cconsistently pay at least 90% of our invoices on time\u201d. Vodafone said it paid SME suppliers 45 days on average from the invoice date. \u201cWe pay 90% of our invoices on time and, where this is not achieved, the most significant factor is receiving the invoices late from the supplier,\u201d a spokesman said. The FSB has estimated that prompt payments to suppliers could prevent 50,000 small businesses going under each year. Any company bidding for public-sector contracts with a future Labour government would have to pay its own suppliers within 30 days, Corbyn said on Tuesday, and Labour would consider creating a binding arbitration system, with fines for persistent late-payers. The Labour leader pledged not to increase the corporation tax rate for small businesses and to scrap quarterly reporting for businesses with turnover of less than \u00a383,000, calling it \u201ca burden, a distraction, that will hold entrepreneurs back\u201d. He said large corporations were \u201cprivileged\u201d by the government in their tax affairs over ordinary people or small businesses. He joked about his own tax return mishap, where he was fined for a late payment, calling it a \u201cdonation\u201d to HMRC. \u201cNo one likes paying tax. We don\u2019t wake up in the morning thinking, \u2018Oh, I really must pay some more tax today\u2019. But most of us know that taxes are essential to a civilised society and a successful economy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo most of us play by the rules. We do our tax returns, as you know, mine seems to attract more attention than most but that\u2019s OK, transparency is important.\u201d Corbyn has been repeatedly criticised by Theresa May for Labour\u2019s pledge to borrow \u00a3500bn for investments, including in regional investment banks. The party has struggled to rebuild trust in its economic credibility, with the latest Observer/Opinium poll showing 44% trust May and her chancellor, Philip Hammond, to run the economy, while just 15% say Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are trustworthy. Amanda Milling, a Conservative member of the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said Labour\u2019s pledge to borrow to invest \u00a3500bn would \u201ccrash the economy, just like they did last time\u201d. In remarks on Tuesday that anticipated some of the criticism, Corbyn said: \u201cThe prime minister frequently accuses me of wanting to bankrupt Britain by borrowing money to fund investment. But, as every business person knows, there is a world of difference between borrowing for capital spending and borrowing to fund the payroll and day to day trading or service delivery. \u201cThe risk of bankruptcy comes not when you borrow to invest in projects that will deliver growth but when you give tax breaks to big companies and the wealthy when you don\u2019t have enough money to run public services.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK inflation steady at 2.3% in March - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a round up of the day\u2019s events. UK inflation was flat, with the consumer price index coming in at 2.3% in March for the second month in a row. That was still the highest level for more than three years, and raises the question of whether the Bank of England should raise interest rates. But with wage growth slowing, real incomes are being hit. UK house prices rose by 5.8% in February but London saw its slowest growth since April 2012. Elsewhere a leading investment group has described the actions of Barclays boss Jes Staley in trying to unmask a whistleblower as \u201camazing\u201d in the light of attempts to encourage people with concerns to come forward. German economic sentiment improved in April but eurozone industrial production was disappointing. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The pound is currently up 0.25% at $1.2441, having been as high as $1.2445 and as low as $1.2404. FXTM research analyst Lukman Otunuga said: Sterling was volatile on Tuesday, with prices oscillating between losses and gains after markets digested the UK\u2019s steady 2.3% inflation figure for March, which was the highest level since September 2013. The ongoing currency weakness created by Brexit, coupled with rising oil prices has elevated inflation above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, with speculation mounting over CPI following its positive trajectory this quarter. Although the immediate market reaction to March\u2019s headline CPI reading was noticeably bullish, gains may be relinquished when participants start to re-evaluate the impact it may have on the UK economy. With inflation still above average earning there is a threat of consumer spending taking a hit, which could spark concerns over the longevity of the UK\u2019s consumer-fuelled economic growth. Should the Bank of England raise interest rates? The answer is complicated, writes Larry Elliott: It seems so obvious. The Bank of England sets interest rates to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target. Inflation is currently 2.3% and \u2013 despite holding steady in March \u2013 is certain to go higher over the coming months. Higher borrowing costs choke off inflationary pressure. Therefore interest rates should now be going up. In reality, it is a bit more complicated than that. The first thing the nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee have to decide is whether the above-target inflation seen in the last couple of months is a temporary blip. It\u2019s quite clear it isn\u2019t. Food is going up, energy companies are raising their tariffs, retailers are passing on the higher costs of imports caused by a weaker pound. Last month\u2019s inflation figure was flattered by the timing of Easter, which led to a sharp fall in the annual cost of air fares. That one-off factor will be reversed in April. The question is not whether inflation will continue rising in 2017 but how high it will go. At least to 3% is the answer, perhaps a bit higher. The next thing for the MPC to consider is whether there is a risk of inflation becoming entrenched. That would happen if rising prices led to workers successfully negotiating higher wages to compensate them for the hit to living standards. There seems little sign that inflation will feed on itself, as it did in the 1970s. His full analysis is here: Here\u2019s our report on the inflation figures: Rising food and clothing prices kept Britain\u2019s inflation rate at its highest level for more than three years last month, putting household budgets under pressure as the Brexit effect on the pound worked its way through the economy. Official figures put inflation on the consumer prices index (CPI) at 2.3% for the second month running in March, in line with economists\u2019 forecasts, as food prices rose at the fastest pace for three years, increasing 1.2% on the year. Economists said inflation was likely to push higher in April and they warned the rising costs of essentials such as groceries were already eating into households\u2019 budgets and leaving them with less cash to spend on other items. Reports from retailers suggest sales have slowed in recent months. \u201cToday\u2019s release confirms our expectations that 2017 will see the end of the consumer spending boom which has driven economic growth in recent years,\u201d said Nina Skero at the consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cWith the prices of essentials such as housing costs, food and transport on the rise, less money will be left over for discretionary spending. This is especially true given that wage growth is unlikely to keep up with the elevated inflation levels.\u201d The full story is here: With the pound now fairly flat against the dollar in the wake of the inflation numbers, the FTSE 100 is pretty buoyant, up 44 points or 0.6%. The host of overseas earners in the UK\u2019s leading index are supported by a weaker sterling, and the fact the currency has moved no higher has been taken positively by investors. Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: While the pound was clearly disappointed that the CPI didn\u2019t grow any further in March, the fact that it avoided the dip forecast by analysts meant the currency\u2019s losses weren\u2019t too pronounced. Against the euro sterling fell 0.2%, shuffling under 1.17 in the process; against the dollar, however, the pound sat flat, keeping its head just above 1.24. Though the pound didn\u2019t have an aggressively sour reaction to the inflation figure, the fact that it didn\u2019t move any higher was enough to lift the FTSE, which surged more than half a percent to hit a 3 week high. The Eurozone indices, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t shake their negative open, the DAX and CAC slipping 0.3% and 0.1% respectively. The region was aided, however, by a pair of better than expected ZEW economic sentiment readings; the German figure came in at a 20 month high of 19.5, while the Eurozone-wide hit a 16 month peak of 26.3. UK house prices rose by 5.8% year on year in February compared to 5.3% the previous month, with London showing the slowest increase since April 2012 at 3.7%. The UK figure is still below the average annual house price growth of 7.3% seen in 2016. The Office for National Statistics said: The main contribution to the increase in UK house prices came from England, where house prices increased by 6.3% over the year to February 2017, with the average price in England now \u00a3234,000. Wales saw house prices increase by 1.8% over the last 12 months to stand at \u00a3145,000. In Scotland, the average price increased by 3.1% over the year to stand at \u00a3139,000. The average price in Northern Ireland currently stands at \u00a3125,000, an increase of 5.7% over the last 12 months. The forthcoming French presidential election is causing some tremors for the euro: Arnaud Masset at Swissquote Bank said: The single currency has held up so far but investors are becoming particularly worried ahead of April 23rd (the first round of the French election). Back with UK inflation, and there is one category of consumer who is being particularly hard hit by price rises, points out Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown: In March food inflation really took off, which suggests the supermarkets are now starting to pass rising import costs onto consumers. Crisps and margarine saw particularly steep price rises, not good news for fans of the crisp sandwich. He added: The inflationary squeeze that\u2019s coming is going to mean consumers have to spend more at the check outs and petrol pumps, and that reduces their capacity to fund discretionary spending. It also reduces people\u2019s propensity to save, which is particularly worrying at a time when the UK\u2019s savings ratio is at its lowest level since the 1960s, and retirement is costlier than ever because of gains in life expectancy. Away from UK inflation, and German consumers remain confident it seems. The ZEW Institute\u2019s economic sentiment index came in at 19.5 in April compared to 12.8 the previous month and expectations of a figure of 14. This was the highest level since August 2015. ZEW president Achim Wambach said: Though the long-term average as calculated from the beginning of the survey (December 1991) is yet to be beaten, these results are comparable to the expectations prior to the Brexit vote in June 2016. The German economic situation has proved fairly robust in the first quarter. This is highlighted by the solid figures for growth in industrial production, the construction sector and retail sales from February. In addition, the consistently high labour demand has boosted private consumption. The financial market experts expect this positive development to continue. However there have also been some disappointing eurozone industrial production figures: More reaction: James Smith, ING Bank economist: UK inflation stayed at 2.3% year on year in March, which when compared to wage growth (which is likely to slow in data released tomorrow), means real incomes could be starting to fall. A major driver of the recent pick-up in inflation has been food prices. Having been depressed for multiple years by a fierce price war, supermarket prices have been increasing fairly rapidly as the near-20% depreciation in sterling since November 2015 pushes up costs. At 1.2%, the annual rate of growth in food &amp; non-alcoholic drink prices is the highest since early 2014. That said, there was a risk that last year\u2019s early Easter provided a temporary drag on today\u2019s data, as items such as air fares would have been lower than had there been a holiday weekend. But at first glance, this effect appears to be fairly limited. Overall, we think that the effect of the weaker pound and higher fuel costs will drive inflation above 3% in the second half of this year...In tomorrow\u2019s jobs report, we expect wage growth (excluding bonuses) to fall back to 2% following some particularly weak \u201csingle month\u201d figures recently. In real terms, that means that disposable incomes will be falling, and we are seeing some signs that this is hitting spending. Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce: The continued elevation in costs at the factory gate suggests that consumer prices are likely to resume their upward trend in the coming months. Businesses say they are facing an uphill struggle to absorb the increasing cost of imports \u2013 a task made more difficult by the raft of additional upfront costs imposed on businesses at the start of the new tax year. As a result, the rising price of imported raw materials are expected to increasingly filter through into higher prices, stifling consumer spending, a key driver of UK growth. It is probable that rising inflation helped weaken UK GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017, with growth likely to have slowed to 0.4%, from 0.7% in the previous quarter. The UK\u2019s growth prospects are expected to remain subdued over the near term, as higher inflation continues to squeeze consumers and businesses. Against this backdrop, it is vital that government does more to ease the cost pressures facing firms by tackling the burden of upfront costs and taxes associated with doing business in the UK. The MPC must also continue to \u2018look through\u2019 the expected rises in inflation and opt for an extended period of monetary stability. This will help businesses to continue to invest, recruit and support the wider economy. Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management: The later date of Easter this year will have held back prices in March, thanks to the lower air fares. However, while the impact of rising oil prices last year is now fading, the full impact of sterling\u2019s devaluation is still feeding through. We would expect the air fare effect to reverse next month, and CPI to move higher, further above the 2% target. And here\u2019s the TUC on the inflation figures. General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: Rising prices and sluggish pay increases mean that real earnings growth has now ground to a halt. Without government action, another living standards crisis is on the cards. We urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better paid jobs. And it\u2019s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting midwives, teachers and other public servants. Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International: Retail sales figures from the British Retail Consortium released overnight showed that the rise in inflation is already starting to bite, with non-food high street sales suffering the worst fall in nearly six years. With price rises outstripping wages, we are getting progressively poorer each month. Unsurprisingly, consumers are choosing to instead focus their spending on essential items like food and fuel. Changing shopping habits and a fall in spending should flash amber warning lights for an economy reliant on confident consumers hitting the shops. Rising inflation also has implications for savers, investors and retirees as it erodes the spending power of future interest and dividend payments and eats away at the worth of your original capital. Inflation never looks like a problem, until suddenly it is a big problem. Once pricing pressures become entrenched, consumers\u2019 feel the pain, companies don\u2019t invest and the market gets worried. Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: Inflation remained above the two percent mark in March, stoking fears that consumer spending \u2013 the engine room of the UK economy \u2013 could begin to slip. Theresa May will be concerned that the sharp fall in sterling over recent months, combined with rising food and fuel costs, is beginning to squeeze living standards. But of even greater concern is the impact this could have on the UK economy during Brexit negotiations. With inflation now beyond the Bank of England\u2019s target, it would not be a surprise to see interest rates hiked sooner rather than later to keep prices in check. Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade: The UK\u2019s consumer price index remains some way above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, though Mark Carney and Co may be somewhat relieved to see that prices haven\u2019t continued to rise. It marks temporary respite from soaring inflation following the post-Brexit collapse of the pound, with a late Easter and fuel prices being partly responsible for the pause. Despite March\u2019s plateau, inflation could pick up again as we head into the second half of 2017, and could even exceed 3% by the summer. Whether that forces the MPC\u2019s hand is still unsure, though - many will want to see unemployment down and wage growth markedly up before an interest rate hike. Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon: With inflation surpassing the Bank of England\u2019s target for a second month running savers will begin to feel the pinch as inflation erodes the value of their hard earned cash and this poses a particular threat to pensioner income. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit: Some respite for consumers \u2013 and the Bank of England \u2013 as consumer price inflation stabilized at 2.3% in March after rising sharply from 0.9% in October. Unfortunately though, it is odds-on that this will prove only a temporary respite on the inflation front. Inflation was held down in March by Easter-related pricing distortions. Specifically, Easter related price hikes (notably on air and sea transport, package holidays, hotels) occurred in March in 2016 but are occurring in April this year. Consumers are facing a serious squeeze as higher inflation is occurring in tandem with muted earnings growth - and this looks set to bite even harder over the coming months. It is evident that the Bank of England has recently become more concerned about the potential inflation overshoot but we still expect interest rates to remain at 0.25% through 2017 and 2018 at least. We suspect that any Bank of England temptation to raise interest rates will be tempered by mounting evidence of a slowing UK economy as consumers rein in their spending and business caution mounts. Likely ongoing muted earnings growth is also seen encouraging the Bank of England to sit tight on interest rates. Rising inflation which is outpacing wage growth puts pressure on household incomes of course, something the Treasury seems aware of in its response to this latest data. A spokesperson said: We are building an economy that works for everyone and helping families with the cost of living by cutting income taxes for 31 million people, freezing fuel duty and increasing the National Living Wage to \u00a37.50 per hour. The pound, initially down on the inflation figures, is now at a day\u2019s high of $1.2446 against the dollar. Rising prices for food, alcohol and tobacco, clothing and footwear, miscellaneous goods and services were largely offset by falls in transport costs, notably air fares, according to the Office for National Statistics. The later timing of Easter had an influence here. The ONS said: The timing of Easter in March 2016 contributed to air fares rising by 22.9% on the month whereas this year, Easter is in April and there was no price rise. Instead fares fell by 3.9% between February and March. BREAKING NEWS UK consumer price inflation - the Bank of England\u2019s preferred measure - has come in at 2.3% year on year in March, the same as the previous month and in line with expectations. This remains the highest year on year level since September 2013. Month on month the rise was 0.4%. More on the news on Monday that Barclays chief executive Jes Staley had attempted to unmask a whistleblower despite being warned not to, and is facing an investigation by regulators. Thomas Moore, investment director at Standard Life Investments told the BBC Today programme that the timing of Staley\u2019s actions was \u201camazing\u201d given that only last year the Financial Conduct Authority issued a report saying it wanted to encourage a culture where whistleblowers could come forward without fear of reprisals. Can Staley survive in his job? Moore says much will depend on the outcome of the regulatory investigation: \u201cThe tone is set by the top of the organisation. If you go to Barclays\u2019 Canary Wharf headquarters you are surrounded by the word \u2018integrity\u2019. \u201cSo it is disappointing when the chief executive is told not to pursue this individual and he continued to chase this individual.\u201d Moore said the issue was a key one for investors: \u201cBanks who behaved badly have the lowest [stock market] valuations.\u201d If you want to follow events as they unfolded on Monday, our live blog is here: Shares in JD Sports Fashion have hit a new all time high after it unveiled record full year profits. They jumped as high as 425p in the immediate wake of the figures and are currently up 4% at 424p. Reuters reports: Britain\u2019s JD Sports Fashion Plc posted a 55 percent rise in full-year headline pretax profit as demand for leisurewear products remained firm. JD Sports, which alongside its core sports retail business runs fashion and outdoor retail outlets such as Scotts and Blacks, said headline profit before tax and exceptional items rose to a record 244.8 million pounds from 157.1 million a year earlier. Like-for-like store sales at its core sports fashion business rose 10 percent but the company said it was \u201cunreasonable\u201d to expect like-for-like sales growth to be maintained at this level. The company, which rivals Mike Ashley-owned Sports Direct in Britain, warned that external influences, such as inflationary pressures arising from Brexit, may impact trading in the latter part of the year. Peel Hunt analyst Jonathan Pritchard said: The results are an example of what the right product, well merchandised can achieve in the current environment and, whilst the trainer trend tailwind has been off the Beaufort scale, JD has sailed it skilfully. Both sports fashion and outdoor exceeded expectations. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: The Eurozone indices fell sharply this Tuesday, the DAX and CAC each dropping half a percent. It appears that the current global political tensions, namely those between the US and Syria/Russia, as well as North Korea, have spooked investors, the FTSE perhaps only avoiding the same level of losses due to the impending inflation update. As expected, investors are taking a cautious view in the wake of growing geo-political tensions. Those investors who are around, that is, given that trading is likely to be fairly quiet in the run-up to the Easter break. The FTSE 100 has fallen around 10 points or 0.1% while France\u2019s Cac has opened 0.5% lower, Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.4% and Spain\u2019s Ibex is 0.6% lower. On the currency markets the pound is flat against the dollar at $1.2411 and upu 0.2% against the euro at \u20ac1.1732. Elsewhere Brent crude has slipped 0.36% to $55.78 a barrel despite the global uncertainty while gold is up $2 to $1256 an ounce. Adding to the general uncertainty is the US Federal Reserve, which recently said it could begin selling off assets bought following the financial crisis, as well as raising interest rates further this year. On Monday Fed chair Janet Yellen made positive noises on the US economy, adding to the feeling that the central bank will continue moving away from its stimulus programme. Reuters reports: The Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to raise U.S. interest rates gradually are aimed at sustaining full employment and near-2-percent inflation without letting the economy overheat, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said on Monday. \u201cI think we have a healthy economy now,\u201d Yellen said at an event at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ford School of Public Policy in Ann Arbor. Unemployment, at 4.5 percent, is now a little bit below the jobless rate that most Fed officials think signals full employment, and inflation is \u201creasonably close\u201d to the Fed\u2019s 2-percent goal, she said. With the economy expected to continue to grow at a moderate pace, she said, the Fed is now shifting its focus. \u201cWhereas before we had our foot pressed down on the gas pedal trying to give the economy all the oomph we possibly could, now allowing the economy to kind of coast and remain on an even keel -- to give it some gas but not so much that we are pressing down hard on the accelerator -- that\u2019s a better stance of monetary policy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to be ahead of the curve and not behind it.\u201d In the U.S. Treasury bond market, yields were little changed after Yellen\u2019s remarks. The Fed raised rates in March for only the third time since the Great Recession, and most Fed officials expect the central bank to raise rates at least two more times this year. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Stock markets are back in nervous mode, with a number of political concerns to worry investors. The US attack on Syria has increased the global uncertainty, and on top of that there are increasing tensions between President Trump\u2019s administration and North Korea. In Europe the French presidential race continues to dominate the agenda. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, said: Flight to safety continues, as geopolitical concerns occupy the global headlines with North Korea\u2019s missile tests, US\u2019 strike on Syria and Jean-Luc Melonchon gaining support in the French election race... According to one Kantar poll, Melonchon advanced to the third place, taking lead over Francois Fillon. Political risks could encourage a further slide in the euro. So the Nikkei has closed down 0.27% and European markets are expected to open slightly lower: On the economic front, the latest UK inflation figures are in focus, and are expected once again to come in above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Many analysts are forecasting a figure of 2.3% in March, flat on the previous month although some believe there could be a slight dip. Unicredit said: We see headline CPI inflation easing to 2.1% year on year in March from 2.3% year on year in the previous month, and core inflation down by 0.3 percentage points to 1.7% year on year. The later timing of Easter this year and a negative contribution from motor fuel prices is likely to more than offset substantial price rises by some of the Big 6 UK energy suppliers. Here\u2019s our preview of what to expect: German confidence figures are also due later and, on the corporate front, we have figures from JD Sports.",

Although the immediate market reaction to March\u2019s headline CPI reading was noticeably bullish, gains may be relinquished when participants start to re-evaluate the impact it may have on the UK economy.

The answer is complicated, writes Larry Elliott:</p> <blockquote> <p>It seems so obvious. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor\">The Bank of England</a> sets interest rates to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/uk-inflation-rate-stays-three-year-high\">Inflation is currently 2.3% and \u2013 despite holding steady in March \u2013 is certain to go higher over the coming months</a>. Higher borrowing costs choke off inflationary pressure. Therefore interest rates should now be going up.</p> <p>In reality, it is a bit more complicated than that. The first thing the nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee have to decide is whether the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/mar2017\">above-target inflation </a>seen in the last couple of months is a temporary blip. It\u2019s quite clear it isn\u2019t. Food is going up, energy companies are raising their tariffs, retailers are passing on the higher costs of imports caused by a weaker pound.</p> <p>Last month\u2019s inflation figure was flattered by the timing of Easter, which led to a sharp fall in the annual cost of air fares. That one-off factor will be reversed in April. The question is not whether inflation will continue rising in 2017 but how high it will go. At least to 3% is the answer, perhaps a bit higher.</p> <p>The next thing for the MPC to consider is whether there is a risk of inflation becoming entrenched. That would happen if rising prices led to workers successfully negotiating higher wages to compensate them for the hit to living standards. There seems little sign that inflation will feed on itself, as it did in the 1970s.</p> </blockquote> <p>His full analysis is here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/uk-inflation-only-going-up-lets-hope-interest-rates-dont-follow\">Inflation is only going one way.

Having been depressed for multiple years by a fierce price war, supermarket prices have been increasing fairly rapidly as the near-20% depreciation in sterling since November 2015 pushes up costs. At 1.2%, the annual rate of growth in food &amp; non-alcoholic drink prices is the highest since early 2014.</p> <p>That said, there was a risk that last year\u2019s early Easter provided a temporary drag on today\u2019s data, as items such as air fares would have been lower than had there been a holiday weekend. But at first glance, this effect appears to be fairly limited.</p> <p>Overall, we think that the effect of the weaker pound and higher fuel costs will drive inflation above 3% in the second half of this year...In tomorrow\u2019s jobs report, we expect wage growth (excluding bonuses) to fall back to 2% following some particularly weak \u201csingle month\u201d figures recently. In real terms, that means that disposable incomes will be falling, and we are seeing some signs that this is hitting spending.</p> <h2><strong>Suren Thiru, Head of Economics at the British Chambers of Commerce: </strong></h2> <p>The continued elevation in costs at the factory gate suggests that consumer prices are likely to resume their upward trend in the coming months.<br></p> <p>Businesses say they are facing an uphill struggle to absorb the increasing cost of imports \u2013 a task made more difficult by the raft of additional upfront costs imposed on businesses at the start of the new tax year. As a result, the rising price of imported raw materials are expected to increasingly filter through into higher prices, stifling consumer spending, a key driver of UK growth.</p> <p>It is probable that rising inflation helped weaken UK GDP growth in the first quarter of 2017, with growth likely to have slowed to 0.4%, from 0.7% in the previous quarter. The UK\u2019s growth prospects are expected to remain subdued over the near term, as higher inflation continues to squeeze consumers and businesses. </p> <p>Against this backdrop, it is vital that government does more to ease the cost pressures facing firms by tackling the burden of upfront costs and taxes associated with doing business in the UK. The MPC must also continue to \u2018look through\u2019 the expected rises in inflation and opt for an extended period of monetary stability. This will help businesses to continue to invest, recruit and support the wider economy.</p> <h2><strong>Ian Kernohan, Economist at Royal London Asset Management:</strong></h2> <p>The later date of Easter this year will have held back prices in March, thanks to the lower air fares. However, while the impact of rising oil prices last year is now fading, the full impact of sterling\u2019s devaluation is still feeding through. We would expect the air fare effect to reverse next month, and CPI to move higher, further above the 2% target.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2017-04-11T08:49:13/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Inflation\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2017-04-11T08:49:13/embed.html\">Inflation</a> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-58ec9afde4b05776df18c9b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-11T09:01:15.367Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here\u2019s the TUC on the inflation figures.

With price rises outstripping wages, we are getting progressively poorer each month. Unsurprisingly, consumers are choosing to instead focus their spending on essential items like food and fuel. Changing shopping habits and a fall in spending should flash amber warning lights for an economy reliant on confident consumers hitting the shops.</p> <p>Rising inflation also has implications for savers, investors and retirees as it erodes the spending power of future interest and dividend payments and eats away at the worth of your original capital.</p> <p>Inflation never looks like a problem, until suddenly it is a big problem. Once pricing pressures become entrenched, consumers\u2019 feel the pain, companies don\u2019t invest and the market gets worried.</p> <h2>Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com:</h2> <p>Inflation remained above the two percent mark in March, stoking fears that consumer spending \u2013 the engine room of the UK economy \u2013 could begin to slip.</p> <p>Theresa May will be concerned that the sharp fall in sterling over recent months, combined with rising food and fuel costs, is beginning to squeeze living standards.</p> <p>But of even greater concern is the impact this could have on the UK economy during Brexit negotiations. With inflation now beyond the Bank of England\u2019s target, it would not be a surprise to see interest rates hiked sooner rather than later to keep prices in check.</p> <h2><strong>Paul Sirani, Chief Market Analyst at Xtrade:</strong></h2> <p>The UK\u2019s consumer price index remains some way above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target, though Mark Carney and Co may be somewhat relieved to see that prices haven\u2019t continued to rise.</p> <p>It marks temporary respite from soaring inflation following the post-Brexit collapse of the pound, with a late Easter and fuel prices being partly responsible for the pause.</p> <p>Despite March\u2019s plateau, inflation could pick up again as we head into the second half of 2017, and could even exceed 3% by the summer. Whether that forces the MPC\u2019s hand is still unsure, though - many will want to see unemployment down and wage growth markedly up before an interest rate hike.</p> <h2>Nick Dixon, Investment Director at Aegon: </h2> <p>With inflation surpassing the Bank of England\u2019s target for a second month running savers will begin to feel the pinch as inflation erodes the value of their hard earned cash and this poses a particular threat to pensioner income.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHS Markit:</h2> <p>Some respite for consumers \u2013 and the Bank of England \u2013 as consumer price inflation stabilized at 2.3% in March after rising sharply from 0.9% in October.</p> <p>Unfortunately though, it is odds-on that this will prove only a temporary respite on the inflation front. Inflation was held down in March by Easter-related pricing distortions. Specifically, Easter related price hikes (notably on air and sea transport, package holidays, hotels) occurred in March in 2016 but are occurring in April this year.</p> <p>Consumers are facing a serious squeeze as higher inflation is occurring in tandem with muted earnings growth - and this looks set to bite even harder over the coming months.</p> <p>It is evident that the Bank of England has recently become more concerned about the potential inflation overshoot but we still expect interest rates to remain at 0.25% through 2017 and 2018 at least. We suspect that any Bank of England temptation to raise interest rates will be tempered by mounting evidence of a slowing UK economy as consumers rein in their spending and business caution mounts. Likely ongoing muted earnings growth is also seen encouraging the Bank of England to sit tight on interest rates.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2017-04-11T08:52:07.337Z\">at 9.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-58ec96d6e4b05776df18c9a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-04-11T08:43:43.903Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Rising inflation which is outpacing wage growth puts pressure on household incomes of course, something the Treasury seems aware of in its response to this latest data.

      "bodyText": "A US banker has been ordered to pay his ex-wife half of the family\u2019s \u00a3140m fortune, after the court of appeal rejected his claim that his \u201cgenius\u201d outshone her contribution to the marriage. Randy Work, 49, a former executive at Texas-based private equity firm Lone Star, had first claimed that his wife of 20 years, Mandy Gray, was entitled to only \u00a35m because she had \u201cunfortunately\u201d failed to stick to the terms of their prenuptial agreement and had had an affair with the couple\u2019s personal physiotherapist. A high court judge rejected Work\u2019s claim that he made an \u201cexceptional contribution\u201d to the marriage and was therefore entitled to more than a 50-50 split of the couple\u2019s assets, which include a \u00a330m mansion in Kensington, west London, complete with swimming pool and fitness centre and an \u00a318m ski lodge in Aspen, Colorado. Ruling on their divorce in 2015 Justice Holman told the businessman that his wealth contribution \u2013 which Work said totalled more than $300m in 10 years \u2013 was not \u201cwholly exceptional\u201d and rejected his claim to be a financial \u201cgenius\u201d. \u201cI personally find that a difficult, and perhaps unhelpful, word in this context,\u201d Holman said. \u201cTo my mind, the word \u2018genius\u2019 tends to be overused and is properly reserved for Leonardo da Vinci, Mozart, Einstein and others like them.\u201d Work, who has spent at least \u00a33m fighting to keep his wife from collecting half of the family fortune, took the case to the court of appeal which on Tuesday unanimously rejected his appeal against Holman\u2019s ruling. \u201cIn our view the husband has failed to demonstrate that Holman J\u2019s decision was wrong,\u201d three court of appeal judges said. London has become known as the divorce capital of the world because British judges tend not to discriminate between breadwinner and homemaker and order equal splits of combined fortunes. However, Work had hoped to convince the court of appeal judges to allow him to join those few men who had been granted more than half of the combined assets in a divorce in recognition of the \u201cwholly exceptional nature\u201d of their success. Sir Martin Sorrell, founder of advertising firm WPP, was awarded 60% of joint assets in his 2005 divorce from Sandra, his wife of 33 years. In 2014, a judge granted the ex-wife of Chris Hohn, the billionaire founder of hedge fund The Children\u2019s Investment Fund, 36% of their $1.5bn fortune. Holman had ruled that although Work was an \u201castute businessman\u201d, Gray was a \u201chighly intelligent\u201d woman who had given up her career to follow her husband to Tokyo, where he made hundreds of millions of pounds exploiting the Japanese financial crisis. \u201cA successful claim to a special contribution requires some exceptional and individual quality in the spouse concerned. Being in the right place at the right time or benefiting from a period of boom is not enough,\u201d Holman said. \u201cIt may one day fall for consideration whether a very highly paid footballer, who is very good at his job but may be no more skilful than past greats, such as Stanley Matthews or Bobby Charlton, makes a special contribution or is merely the lucky beneficiary of the colossal payments now made possible by the sale of television rights.\u201d Holman said Work and Gray, 47, had been \u201ctwo strong and equal partners\u201d and he would not have been able to amass his vast fortune without her contribution. The pair, who are both American and have two teenage children, met in 1992 and married in 1995. They split up in 2013 when Gray began an affair with the couple\u2019s physiotherapist, 44, who she now lives with in a rented flat in Kensington. During the divorce hearing Holman had said the case \u201cshould be so easy\u201d to settle as there was \u201cplenty of money to go round\u201d and criticised the couple for descending into \u201cunedifying and destructive pugilism\u201d.",

    "webTitle": "Barclays whistleblower case sparks calls for more protection", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Whistleblowing charities and law firms have called for companies to offer more protection to workers who flag up internal problems after the chief executive of Barclays attempted to track down the author of anonymous letters. Jes Staley is being investigated by financial regulators and faces a significant cut to his pay after admitting trying to unmask a whistleblower who made allegations about a long-term associate he had brought to the bank. Public Concern at Work (PCaW), a charity for whistleblowers, said there was \u201cmuch work to be done\u201d while GoodCorporation said the Barclays saga would be a \u201creal test\u201d for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority. There are strict regulations in the financial services industry about encouraging and protecting whistleblowers. This includes the senior managers and certification regime, which is aimed at improving individual accountability within the financial services industry. Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the House of Commons Treasury select committee, said: \u201cThe senior managers and certification regime is supposed to ensure that whistleblowers are protected. This is the first proper test of those rules, and it is for the regulators to test whether Barclays had the right processes in place. The Treasury committee will take a close interest in the regulators\u2019 conclusions.\u201d Cathy James, the chief executive of PCaW, said there had been an increase in interest from City firms about how to draw up internal guidelines and calls to its helpline from potential whistleblowers. James said: \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to say whether that\u2019s good or bad news in terms of a change in culture.\u201d \u201cIs that because of increased confidence in whistleblowing, or increased interest from the regulator? It still remains to be seen,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is clearly much work to be done.\u201d Last year the whistleblowing charity advised on 130 cases involving individuals working in the financial sector, compared with 98 in 2015 and 102 in 2014. So far this year, it has received 35 calls from the financial sector. PCaW is working with some of the big banks and other financial firms to help them draw up internal whistleblowing guidelines. James said new FCA rules, including the requirement to have an internal whistleblowing champion since last September, had contributed to the surge in interest. However, one employment lawyer said Barclays\u2019 refusal to sack Staley undermined its approach to whistleblowers. Barclays has said it will send Staley a formal written reprimand and cut his bonus but also backed him to continue as chief executive. Anna Birtwistle from CM Murray said: \u201cWhile cutting Staley\u2019s pay may outwardly appear to represent a strong response from Barclays, it is difficult to reconcile the board\u2019s continued confidence in Staley with its stated commitment to whistleblowing. \u201cFostering an open culture of disclosing wrongdoing in the workplace requires top-down stewardship and while it may be understandable that Barclays has backed Staley given his successes in post, the bank\u2019s response to Staley\u2019s actions may give mixed messages to its employees and the wider financial services industry about the steadfastness of its commitment to whistleblowing.\u201d GoodCorporation, a consultancy that advises businesses on ethics, said Staley\u2019s conduct could discourage others whistleblowers from speaking out. Leon Martin, the managing director of GoodCorporation, said: \u201cThe Barclays whistleblower scandal will be a real test for the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, whose rules on whistleblowing clearly state that a whistleblower\u2019s confidentiality must be protected and that firms need to create a culture that encourages employees to raise concerns about poor behaviour. \u201cIt is hard to see how an organisation whose CEO instructs his internal security team to identify the author of a whistleblowing letter has created an open culture whereby employees feel confident to speak out. With all that has been said about reforming behaviour in the banking sector, it seems clear that this is still a work in progress. \u201cWhistleblowing is an essential component of good corporate governance which needs to be embraced at the top of an organisation. An effective board will ensure that the right culture is in place, paying particular heed to employee confidence in raising concerns and to monitoring the ways in which they are dealt with. Avoiding any form or repercussion or detriment is essential.\u201d",

This includes <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/senior-managers-certification-regime\">the senior managers and certification regime</a>, which is aimed at improving individual accountability within the financial services industry.</p> <p>Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the House of Commons Treasury select committee, said: \u201cThe senior managers and certification regime is supposed to ensure that whistleblowers are protected. This is the first proper test of those rules, and it is for the regulators to test whether Barclays had the right processes in place. The Treasury committee will take a close interest in the regulators\u2019 conclusions.\u201d</p> <p>Cathy James, the chief executive of PCaW, said there had been an increase in interest from City firms about how to draw up internal guidelines and calls to its helpline from potential whistleblowers.</p> <p>James said: \u201cI\u2019m not in a position to say whether that\u2019s good or bad news in terms of a change in culture.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that because of increased confidence in whistleblowing, or increased interest from the regulator? It still remains to be seen,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is clearly much work to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Last year the whistleblowing charity advised on 130 cases involving individuals working in the financial sector, compared with 98 in 2015 and 102 in 2014. So far this year, it has received 35 calls from the financial sector.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>PCaW is working with some of the big banks and other financial firms to help them draw up internal whistleblowing guidelines. James said new FCA rules, including the requirement to have an internal whistleblowing champion since last September, had contributed to the surge in interest.</p> <p>However, one employment lawyer said Barclays\u2019 refusal to sack Staley undermined its approach to whistleblowers. Barclays has said it will send Staley a formal written reprimand and cut his bonus but <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/barclays-chief-probably-guilty-of-behaving-like-chump\">also backed him to continue as chief executive.</a></p> <p>Anna Birtwistle from CM Murray said: \u201cWhile cutting Staley\u2019s pay may outwardly appear to represent a strong response from Barclays, it is difficult to reconcile the board\u2019s continued confidence in Staley with its stated commitment to whistleblowing. </p> <p>\u201cFostering an open culture of disclosing wrongdoing in the workplace requires top-down stewardship and while it may be understandable that Barclays has backed Staley given his successes in post, the bank\u2019s response to Staley\u2019s actions may give mixed messages to its employees and the wider financial services industry about the steadfastness of its commitment to whistleblowing.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>GoodCorporation, a consultancy that advises businesses on ethics, said Staley\u2019s conduct could discourage others whistleblowers from speaking out.</p> <p>Leon Martin, the managing director of GoodCorporation, said: \u201cThe Barclays whistleblower scandal will be a real test for the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, whose rules on whistleblowing clearly state that a whistleblower\u2019s confidentiality must be protected and that firms need to create a culture that encourages employees to raise concerns about poor behaviour.</p> <p> \u201cIt is hard to see how an organisation whose CEO instructs his internal security team to identify the author of a whistleblowing letter has created an open culture whereby employees feel confident to speak out. With all that has been said about reforming behaviour in the banking sector, it seems clear that this is still a work in progress.</p> <p> \u201cWhistleblowing is an essential component of good corporate governance which needs to be embraced at the top of an organisation. An effective board will ensure that the right culture is in place, paying particular heed to employee confidence in raising concerns and to monitoring the ways in which they are dealt with. Avoiding any form or repercussion or detriment is essential.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "It seems so obvious. The Bank of England sets interest rates to hit the government\u2019s 2% inflation target. Inflation is currently 2.3% and \u2013 despite holding steady in March \u2013 is certain to go higher over the coming months. Higher borrowing costs choke off inflationary pressure. Therefore interest rates should now be going up. In reality, it is a bit more complicated than that. The first thing the nine members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee have to decide is whether the above-target inflation seen in the last couple of months is a temporary blip. It\u2019s quite clear it isn\u2019t. Food is going up, energy companies are raising their tariffs, retailers are passing on the higher costs of imports caused by a weaker pound. Last month\u2019s inflation figure was flattered by the timing of Easter, which led to a sharp fall in the annual cost of air fares. That one-off factor will be reversed in April. The question is not whether inflation will continue rising in 2017, but how high it will go. At least to 3% is the answer, perhaps a bit higher. The next thing for the MPC to consider is whether there is a risk of inflation becoming entrenched. That would happen if rising prices led to workers successfully negotiating higher wages to compensate them for the hit to living standards. There seems little sign that inflation will feed on itself, as it did in the 1970s. Paradoxical though it sounds, a combination of higher prices and stagnant wages is actually deflationary for the economy. That\u2019s because living standards come under downward pressure, leading to consumers tightening their belts and companies investing less. The Bank doesn\u2019t need to raise interest rates to bring down inflation. If it shows a bit of patience, inflation will come down of its own accord. That is provided there is not another downward lurch in sterling, because that would further raise the cost of imports and push the inflation rate closer to 4%. If the MPC sat tight under those circumstances, the financial markets might decide that the pound was a one-way bet and carry on selling. That would be the nightmare scenario for the Bank. Rising inflation would intensify the deflationary squeeze on living standards but make it nigh-on impossible to ignore the case for an interest-rate rise that would risk tipping the economy into outright recession. So what does the MPC do? Simple. Members of the committee make hawkish speeches in which they explain how serious they are about hitting the inflation target. A couple of them even vote for a rate rise, in the hope that the pretence of an early increase in borrowing costs supports the pound. Meanwhile, the MPC keeps its fingers crossed and hopes for the best. Productivity slump linked to research investment failure The impact of the financial crisis that began almost 10 years ago is well documented. Banks made reckless decisions and some of them nearly collapsed as a result. Lenders became risk-averse and stopped lending. The lack of credit stopped the economy in its tracks. The story of how RBS and HBOS teetered on the brink of disaster after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the autumn of 2008 is by now familiar. Less well explained is the link between the credit crunch and productivity recorded since the slump. Output per worker in the UK is around 15% lower than it would have been had the pre-crisis trend continued, and nobody really knows why. Maarten de Ridder, an economist at Cambridge University, thinks he has at least part of the solution to the productivity puzzle: companies that wanted to invest in research and development struggled to obtain funds from the stricken banks, resulting in a 32% fall in R&amp;D investment in 2008-09, the years when the economy was in recession. Innovation takes time to bear fruit so de Ridder \u2013 in a paper presented to the Royal Economic Society\u2019s annual conference \u2013 compared sales in the US between 2011 and 2014 for firms that relied on the most credit-constrained banks and those that fared better during the financial crisis. He found that the most severely affected firms fell 12% behind those with the least exposure, with dramatic results for the wider economy. His results are even more relevant to Britain, where the post-crisis productivity slowdown has been even more pronounced. Had cash-starved UK firms been able to find the necessary finance, the economy would now be 5% bigger. Britain\u2019s R&amp;D is, according to the latest official figures, on a gently rising trend so it may be firms that want funds for investment are now able to get them. But de Ridder says that in the event of another financial crisis the state should itself make credit available to ensure companies can carry on investing. That sounds eminently sensible.",

      "bodyText": "Rising food and clothing prices kept Britain\u2019s inflation rate at its highest level for more than three years last month, putting household budgets under pressure as the Brexit effect on the pound worked its way through the economy. Official figures put inflation on the consumer prices index (CPI) at 2.3% for the second month running in March, in line with economists\u2019 forecasts, as food prices rose at the fastest pace for three years, increasing 1.2% on the year. Economists said inflation was likely to push higher in April and they warned the rising costs of essentials such as groceries were already eating into household budgets and leaving people with less cash to spend on other items. Reports from retailers suggest sales slowed in recent months. \u201cToday\u2019s release confirms our expectations that 2017 will see the end of the consumer spending boom which has driven economic growth in recent years,\u201d said Nina Skero at the consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research. \u201cWith the prices of essentials such as housing costs, food and transport on the rise, less money will be left over for discretionary spending. This is especially true given that wage growth is unlikely to keep up with the elevated inflation levels.\u201d Much of the pressure on inflation has come from the pound\u2019s sharp fall against other currencies after last June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. That makes imports to the UK more expensive, with firms now passing on those higher costs to shoppers. There has also been a marked effect on inflation in the UK and other countries from higher global oil prices. Inflation has risen above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target from just 0.3% this time last year, bringing an abrupt end to a brief period when Britons enjoyed incomes rising in real terms, or faster than inflation. \u201cRising prices and sluggish pay increases mean that real earnings growth has now ground to a halt,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cWithout government action, another living standards crisis is on the cards. \u201cWe urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better-paid jobs. And it\u2019s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting midwives, teachers and other public servants.\u201d The Treasury said it was also taking action. \u201cWe are building an economy that works for everyone and helping families with the cost of living by cutting income taxes for 31 million people, freezing fuel duty and increasing the national living wage to \u00a37.50 per hour,\u201d said a Treasury spokesman. The Resolution Foundation said the latest inflation figure meant real average earnings look set to have fallen during the first three months of 2017. \u201cWith further price rises expected later this year, and no sign yet of wage settlements responding, this pay squeeze looks set to be deeper and longer than expected,\u201d said Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the thinktank. The Office for National Statistics said price changes for a range of goods and services in March put upward pressure on inflation. However, some of that was offset by downward pressure on overall inflation from air fares. The cost of a flight rose sharply between February and March 2016 because of the early Easter holidays but this year Easter is later and there has been no rise in air fares. A dip in petrol and diesel prices last month also tempered the pressure on inflation. However, compared with a year ago, fuel costs were up 17% in March. There was upward pressure from a variety of foods with only fruit having a small downward effect. The largest upward effects came from margarine, low-fat spread and crisps. Whisky and beer prices rose and cigarettes also played a role in keeping inflation high last month. Clothing and footwear prices were another factor, rising 2% between February and March. Some economists predict inflation reaching 3% this year although few feel the cost pressures will push the Bank of England into raising interest rates from their record low of 0.25%. One of the nine members on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), outgoing policymaker Kristin Forbes, voted for a rate rise in March. But the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, and other policymakers have indicated they are happy to tolerate inflation being above their government-set target in return for supporting growth and safeguarding jobs with low borrowing costs. \u201cAll told, we think that CPI inflation will peak at just over 3% before the end of 2017,\u201d said Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital Economics. \u201cBut we don\u2019t think that that will panic the MPC into raising rates imminently. Given the uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations and the fact that there has been little sign of building domestic cost pressures, we think that the MPC will hold off until mid-2018 before raising rates.\u201d The next figures on wage growth and unemployment are published on Wednesday. Economists expect average pay growth was 2.2% in the three months to February compared with a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll.",

Let's hope interest rates don't follow | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Economists said inflation was likely to push higher in April and they warned the rising costs of essentials such as groceries were already eating into household budgets and leaving people with less cash to spend on other items. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/uk-retail-sales-fall-living-costs\">Reports from retailers suggest sales slowed in recent months</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cToday\u2019s release confirms our expectations that 2017 will see the end of the consumer spending boom which has driven economic growth in recent years,\u201d said Nina Skero at the consultancy the Centre for Economics and Business Research.</p> <p>\u201cWith the prices of essentials such as housing costs, food and transport on the rise, less money will be left over for discretionary spending. This is especially true given that wage growth is unlikely to keep up with the elevated inflation levels.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the pressure on inflation has come from the pound\u2019s sharp fall against other currencies after last June\u2019s vote to leave the EU. That makes imports to the UK more expensive, with firms now passing on those higher costs to shoppers. There has also been a marked effect on inflation in the UK and other countries from higher global oil prices.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Inflation has risen above the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target from just <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/timeseries/d7g7/mm23\">0.3% this time last year</a>, bringing an abrupt end to a brief period when Britons enjoyed incomes rising in real terms, or faster than inflation. </p> <p>\u201cRising prices and sluggish pay increases mean that real earnings growth has now ground to a halt,\u201d said the TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cWithout government action, another living standards crisis is on the cards.</p> <p>\u201cWe urgently need more investment in skills and infrastructure to build strong foundations for better-paid jobs. And it\u2019s time to scrap the pay restrictions hitting midwives, teachers and other public servants.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/apr/11/markets-edgy-on-political-risks-ahead-of-uk-inflation-business-live\">UK inflation steady at 2.3% in March - business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Treasury said it was also taking action.</p> <p>\u201cWe are building an economy that works for everyone and helping families with the cost of living by cutting income taxes for 31 million people, freezing fuel duty and increasing the national living wage to \u00a37.50 per hour,\u201d said a Treasury spokesman.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation said the latest inflation figure meant real average earnings look set to have fallen during the first three months of 2017.</p> <p>\u201cWith further price rises expected later this year, and no sign yet of wage settlements responding, this pay squeeze looks set to be deeper and longer than expected,\u201d said Stephen Clarke, economic analyst at the thinktank.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said price changes for a range of goods and services in March put upward pressure on inflation. However, some of that was offset by downward pressure on overall inflation from air fares. The cost of a flight rose sharply between February and March 2016 because of the early Easter holidays but this year Easter is later and there has been no rise in air fares.</p> <p>A dip in petrol and diesel prices last month also tempered the pressure on inflation. However, compared with a year ago, fuel costs were up 17% in March.</p> <p>There was upward pressure from a variety of foods with only fruit having a small downward effect. The largest upward effects came from margarine, low-fat spread and crisps. Whisky and beer prices rose and cigarettes also played a role in keeping inflation high last month. Clothing and footwear prices were another factor, rising 2% between February and March.</p> <p>Some economists predict inflation reaching 3% this year although few feel the cost pressures will push the Bank of England into raising interest rates from their record low of 0.25%. </p> <p>One of the nine members on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC), outgoing policymaker Kristin Forbes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/mar/16/bank-of-england-uk-interest-rates-monetary-policy-committee\">voted for a rate rise in March</a>. But the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, and other policymakers have indicated they are happy to tolerate inflation being above their government-set target in return for supporting growth and safeguarding jobs with low borrowing costs.</p> <p>\u201cAll told, we think that CPI inflation will peak at just over 3% before the end of 2017,\u201d said Ruth Gregory at the consultancy Capital Economics.<br></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/apr/11/uk-inflation-rate-stays-three-year-high\">UK inflation stays at three-year high of 2.3%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut we don\u2019t think that that will panic the MPC into raising rates imminently. Given the uncertainty around the Brexit negotiations and the fact that there has been little sign of building domestic cost pressures, we think that the MPC will hold off until mid-2018 before raising rates.\u201d</p> <p>The next figures on wage growth and unemployment are published on Wednesday. Economists expect average pay growth was 2.2% in the three months to February compared with a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll.</p>",
