In the kind of speaking double act beloved of the event\u2019s organisers, Al Gore, the former US vice-president, who has described climate change as \u201cthe biggest challenge our civilisation faces\u201d, will discuss the subject alongside Pharrell Williams. The pop star, who reached No 1 with Happy, is appearing as creative director of Bionic Yarn, a company that turns fibres from recycled plastic into durable textiles. The energetic Gore is also participating in other events looking at how business should respond to climate change, alongside Lord Stern, president of the British Academy, and speakers from the insurance company Axa. \u2022 Elsewhere, conflict is the number-one issue for the political and business elite this year. The rise of Islamic State has awoken fears over failures of national governance and the collapse of nation states. Several Middle Eastern leaders are in attendance, including Egypt\u2019s president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi; King Abdullah of Jordan; Haidar al-Abadi, the prime minister of Iraq; and Massoud Barzani, the president of the autonomous Kurdistan region. The Ukraine crisis is a reminder that \u201clong-forgotten\u201d disputes can flare back into life, the World Economic Foundation says, with widespread consequences for a whole region. Petro Poroshenko, the president of Ukraine, will be looking for backing as his country risks defaulting on its debts. He should get support from George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, who is pushing European governments to offer Kiev more help. He will be lobbying the likes of Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, France\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Italy\u2019s Matteo Renzi. The terror attacks in France this month will also be debated and the former UK prime minister Tony Blair, will take part in a session on Wednesday examining whether religion is a pretext for conflict. \u2022 Global authorities were slow, at least initially, to respond to the Ebola outbreak and provide resources to the countries affected, according to the organisers at Davos. The forum will ask what lessons can be learned. Panellists include Kofi Annan, former secretary general of the United Nations, as well as Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organisation. Alpha Cond\u00e9, the president of Guinea, who has faced accusations of being initially slow to respond to Ebola, is also speaking. The New York Times quoted him recently as saying: \u201cWhile shaving, I think of Ebola; while eating, I think of Ebola; while sleeping, I think of Ebola.\u201d \u2022 Central banks will be a major topic of conversation in the meeting rooms, coffee shops and bars of Davos as monetary policy in Europe and the US continues to diverge and inflation falls across the global economy. The shock abolition of Switzerland\u2019s currency gap last week has left many financial firms nursing losses and reminded us all that 2015 could be a turbulent year in the markets. Thomas Jordan, the Swiss central bank chief who sparked the turmoil, can expect a lively reception. At least seven other central bank chiefs are attending, including the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. However, the European Central Bank president Mario Draghi is not attending this year. He will be stuck in Frankfurt handling the ECB\u2019s meeting on Thursday, where a big quantitative easing (QE) programme could be announced. At a debate on the prospect of higher interest rates in the US, delegates from emerging markets will be pushing American officials to handle the ending of the QE programme responsibly after seeing \u201chot money\u201d pour into their economies. They do not want a repeat of the currency crisis that struck Argentina during last year\u2019s meeting. \u2022 Meanwhile, the tumble in the oil price to five-year lows means different things to different Davos attendees. It is a bitter blow to exporters, raises political risk in the Middle East and hits growth in emerging markets. Once he arrives in Switzerland, Abdalla Salem El-Badri, Opec\u2019s secretary general, will face criticism from producers over the cartel\u2019s refusal to cut supplies.

      "bodyText": "Climate change Last year was the warmest on record, and climate change will be high on the agenda during the first full day of events in Davos. Al Gore, the former vice-president of the US, who has described climate change as \u201cthe biggest challenge our civilisation faces\u201d, is taking centre stage alongside Pharrell Williams, the pop star who sang \u201cHappy\u201d but who is appearing as creative director of Bionic Yarn, a company that turns fibres from recycled plastic into durable textiles. Gore is participating in other events looking at how business should respond to climate change, alongside Lord Stern, president of the British Academy, and speakers from the insurance company Axa. Other events covering this topic include \u201cBuilding for the Storm\u201d, asking how governments should respond to climate change. Another session will look at how a comprehensive global climate deal can be achieved. Political instability Conflict is the number-one issue for the political and business elite this year. The rise of Islamic State has awoken fears over failures of national governance and the collapse of nation states. Several Middle Eastern leaders are in attendance, including Egypt\u2019s president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi; King Abdullah of Jordan; Haidar al-Abadi, prime minister of Iraq; and Massoud Barzani, president of the autonomous Kurdistan region. The Ukraine crisis is a reminder that \u201clong-forgotten\u201d disputes can flare back into life, the World Economic Foundation says, with widespread consequences for a whole region. Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine, will be looking for support as his country risks defaulting on its debts. Poroshenko should get support from George Soros, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, who is pushing European governments to offer Kiev more help. He will be lobbying the likes of Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, France\u2019s Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Italy\u2019s Matteo Renzi. The terror attacks in France this month will also be debated, just days after many heads of government marched in Paris. On Wednesday, the former UK prime minister Tony Blair will take part in a session examining whether religion is a pretext for conflict. Pandemics Global authorities were slow, at least initially, to respond to the Ebola outbreak and provide resources to the countries affected, according to the organisers at Davos. So what lessons can we learn? Panellists discussing the subject include Kofi Annan, former secretary general of the UN, as well as Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organisation. Alpha Cond\u00e9, the president of Guinea, who has faced accusations of being initially slow to respond to Ebola, is also speaking. The New York Times quoted him recently saying: \u201cWhile shaving I think of Ebola, while eating I think of Ebola, while sleeping I think of Ebola.\u201d Technology Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is among those speaking on the topic of \u201cIn Tech We Trust\u201d. Eric Schmidt, the boss of Google, is one of this year\u2019s co-chairs while Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Satya Nadella of Microsoft will also be involved in a debate on the future of the digital economy. Cyber-security should be high on the agenda too, following David Cameron\u2019s controversial suggestion that governments should be given access to encrypted data. Jack Ma, founder of China\u2019s search engine Alibaba, is also a key speaker. Quantitative easing Central banks will be a major topic of conversation in the meeting rooms, coffee shops and bars of Davos this week, as monetary policy in Europe and the US continues to diverge and inflation falls across the global economy. The shock abolition of Switzerland\u2019s currency gap last week has left many financial firms nursing losses, and reminded us all that 2015 could be a turbulent year in the markets. Thomas Jordan, the Swiss central bank chief who sparked the turmoil, can expect a lively reception. At least seven other central bank chiefs are also attending, including the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. The European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi isn\u2019t attending this year. He will be stuck in Frankfurt handling the ECB\u2019s meeting on Thursday, where a big quantitative easing (QE) programme could be announced. Earlier that day a debate will take place on the prospect of higher interest rates in the US. Delegates from emerging markets will be pushing American officials to handle the ending of the QE programme responsibly, after seeing \u201chot money\u201d pour into their economies. They don\u2019t want a repeat of the currency crisis that struck Argentina during last year\u2019s meeting. Inequality Income inequality has featured highly on Davos\u2019s agenda for several years, but progress remains disappointingly slow. The World Economic Foundation sees rising socioeconomic inequality as driving \u201csocial fragility\u201d. It reminded delegates that the average income of the richest 10% of nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is now nine times larger than that of the poorest 10%. The global unemployment rate is expected to remain at current levels until 2018, showing the failure to tackle the challenges thrown up by the financial crisis. Bill and Marissa Gates, and the Oxfam International executive director Winnie Byanyima will be putting the case for more support for developing nations; Byanyima has extra clout as a co-chair of this year\u2019s meeting. The OECD chief Angel Gurr\u00eda and Guy Ryder of the International Labour Organisation will be lobbying for workers to get a better deal. Oil The tumble in the oil price to five-year lows means different things for Davos attendees. It\u2019s a bitter blow to exporters, raising political risk in the Middle East and hitting growth in emerging markets. Once he arrives in Switzerland, Abdalla Salem El-Badri, Opec\u2019s secretary general, will face criticism from producers over the cartel\u2019s refusal to cut supplies. Western leaders are more sanguine, welcoming the boost to consumers\u2019 spending power. Environmental groups, though, will be urging oil producers not to drag their feet over green technologies.",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "New venture by James Balfour to offer high-intensity group exercise classes on a pay-per-vist basis, with no contract and no hidden fees", 
      "body": "<p>The Balfour family have form in opening gyms. They\u2019ve done it twice, and now are about to do it all over again.</p> <p>The first venture was Fitness First, started in Bournemouth in 1993 by Mike Balfour. He turned it into the biggest private health club chain in the world and today, the business has some 380 gyms in 16 countries and revenue of \u00a3500m.</p> <p>In 2005 Balfour cut his links when the company was bought by private equity firm BC Partners for \u00a3812m but two years later he did it again, starting Jatomi Fitness with his son James.</p> <p>The company is successful, with 70 clubs around the world, but is pretty much the same as its predecessor. But to hear James tell it, the newer business is unexciting: he describes it as \u201cFitness Second\u201d and now Balfour junior has a new idea: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that model anymore,\u201d he says. It is, he adds, typical of a \u201cbroken\u201d industry.</p> <p>So, a year ago, he returned to the UK after spells with the family firm in eastern Europe and Asia, with an idea for a new type of fitness club with a new business model. The plan, devised with co-founder and fellow former Jatomi executive Giles Dean, is for the opposite of the \u201cbig box\u201d gym business that his father built, and which still accounts for much of the market today.</p> <p>Mike Balfour, 65, has signed up as an investor and board member but intends to let his son have free rein. \u201cThe two of us working closely on the same business was impossible,\u201d he says, perhaps only half-jokingly. \u201cHe learned some lessons along the way, but that\u2019s why he had to do his own thing.\u201d</p> <p>According to James, 31, there\u2019s plenty of space for a new \u201cdisruptive\u201d company in the \u00a34bn UK fitness industry \u2013 for a number of reasons. For one thing, he says, the model of the industry-standard 12-month contract, not to mention the joining fee, is solely in the interests of the companies, not their customers.</p> <p>As a result, he claims, 50% to 60% of UK gymgoers cancel their membership each year. \u201cThe average millennial doesn\u2019t want to sign a contract that looks like a mortgage, just to go to a health club.\u201d And, he says, that\u2019s especially true in London, which has a particularly young and itinerant population. \u201cMy challenge to Fitness First, Virgin Active and all the others would be: if you believe in your product, tear up your contracts now and see how many people come back. They won\u2019t do it, because they know that so many people will leave.\u201d</p> <p>A second major reason he believes his new business will work, Balfour says, is that when people sign up to a gym, they effectively pay for access to fitness equipment, when what they really want is to become fitter, thinner or stronger. Personal training is one way to achieve this but, at \u00a350 to \u00a375 per hour, it is neither a particularly flexible nor affordable solution.</p> <p>So, when his business opens its doors for the first time on Monday, it will offer high-intensity group exercise classes on a pay-per-visit basis, with no contract and no hidden fees.</p> <p>The first 1Rebel gym \u2013 in the shadow of the Gherkin in the City of London \u2013 is an 8,000 sq ft space divided into two large studios.

      "bodyText": "The Balfour family have form in opening gyms. They\u2019ve done it twice, and now are about to do it all over again. The first venture was Fitness First, started in Bournemouth in 1993 by Mike Balfour. He turned it into the biggest private health club chain in the world and today, the business has some 380 gyms in 16 countries and revenue of \u00a3500m. In 2005 Balfour cut his links when the company was bought by private equity firm BC Partners for \u00a3812m but two years later he did it again, starting Jatomi Fitness with his son James. The company is successful, with 70 clubs around the world, but is pretty much the same as its predecessor. But to hear James tell it, the newer business is unexciting: he describes it as \u201cFitness Second\u201d and now Balfour junior has a new idea: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that model anymore,\u201d he says. It is, he adds, typical of a \u201cbroken\u201d industry. So, a year ago, he returned to the UK after spells with the family firm in eastern Europe and Asia, with an idea for a new type of fitness club with a new business model. The plan, devised with co-founder and fellow former Jatomi executive Giles Dean, is for the opposite of the \u201cbig box\u201d gym business that his father built, and which still accounts for much of the market today. Mike Balfour, 65, has signed up as an investor and board member but intends to let his son have free rein. \u201cThe two of us working closely on the same business was impossible,\u201d he says, perhaps only half-jokingly. \u201cHe learned some lessons along the way, but that\u2019s why he had to do his own thing.\u201d According to James, 31, there\u2019s plenty of space for a new \u201cdisruptive\u201d company in the \u00a34bn UK fitness industry \u2013 for a number of reasons. For one thing, he says, the model of the industry-standard 12-month contract, not to mention the joining fee, is solely in the interests of the companies, not their customers. As a result, he claims, 50% to 60% of UK gymgoers cancel their membership each year. \u201cThe average millennial doesn\u2019t want to sign a contract that looks like a mortgage, just to go to a health club.\u201d And, he says, that\u2019s especially true in London, which has a particularly young and itinerant population. \u201cMy challenge to Fitness First, Virgin Active and all the others would be: if you believe in your product, tear up your contracts now and see how many people come back. They won\u2019t do it, because they know that so many people will leave.\u201d A second major reason he believes his new business will work, Balfour says, is that when people sign up to a gym, they effectively pay for access to fitness equipment, when what they really want is to become fitter, thinner or stronger. Personal training is one way to achieve this but, at \u00a350 to \u00a375 per hour, it is neither a particularly flexible nor affordable solution. So, when his business opens its doors for the first time on Monday, it will offer high-intensity group exercise classes on a pay-per-visit basis, with no contract and no hidden fees. The first 1Rebel gym \u2013 in the shadow of the Gherkin in the City of London \u2013 is an 8,000 sq ft space divided into two large studios. One will be for a Spinning-style indoor cycling workout called \u201cRebel Ride\u201d and another for \u201cRebel Reshape\u201d, which combines resistance exercises such as weights with intense bursts of running on treadmills. Workouts will be accompanied by pumping music, sometimes from a live band that will join the fitness instructor on stage. A similar principle has already proved popular in the US, where Barry\u2019s Bootcamp, SoulCycle and Orangetheory Fitness have had success. All three have taken steps to offer their classes to gym-goers in the UK and other countries, but Balfour is keen to stress that 1Rebel sets itself apart from the competition. He unashamedly admits to being an admirer of taxi app business Uber: \u201cThey only take bank details once, there is minimal form-filling, and passengers are emailed receipts for everything they buy.\u201d So, 1Rebel will offer its customers the same, as well as the opportunity to book classes via an app or the website, and to pick out their exact spot in the class, taking into account the locations of music speakers, fans and the instructor. This system should have the added benefit of avoiding the \u201cscramble\u201d for prized locations in some SoulCycle classes \u2013 \u201cwhere a place up front is a status symbol, akin to sitting front row at a concert or fashion show\u201d \u2013 according to the New York Times. Another major selling point, according to Balfour, is the quality and size of the changing rooms. A company that fitted out Apple\u2019s Regent Street store was called in to install suspended panes of glass in the showers and customers will be able to take advantage of vintage barber\u2019s chairs, unlimited towels, complimentary cosmetics, GHD hair-straighteners and mobile-phone charging sockets. The interior, according to Balfour, is \u201cpared-back industrial luxe\u201d. The target audience is mainly women, and those who are cash-rich and time-poor and can afford the cost of a 45-minute session costing \u00a317-\u00a325, according to the number of classes paid for in one go. It\u2019s not cheap, especially when the new wave of budget gym operators such as Pure Gym \u2013 founded in 2009 and now the biggest in the country, with 450,000 members \u2013 offer an entire month\u2019s membership for a similar price. Balfour admits that his contract-free model is not without risk, but points to the fact that it received a ringing endorsement from a crowd-funding campaign that beat its target of \u00a31.15m, raising \u00a31.54m for 34% equity on Crowdcube. \u201cInitially we wanted to expand very quickly,\u201d Balfour says. \u201cWe wanted to have 20 sites across London in three to five years.\u201d But as plans have evolved, it has been decided that it would be wiser to open only five clubs in the same timeframe. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to dilute the brand,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the Starbucks effect or, for that matter, the Fitness First effect.\u201d However, a second site in the City of London is already scheduled to open in April and, if things progress as planned, Balfour sees no reason why 1Rebel could not expand to \u201cother global cities with fashion-forward, fitness-forward people\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Mario Draghi, the urbane boss of the European Central Bank, is about to print hundreds of billions of euros to rescue the faltering continental economy. The City expects him to launch his financial bazooka, otherwise known as quantitative easing (QE), on Thursday after the central bank governing council\u2019s monthly meeting.</p> <p>His hand was forced last week by events in Zurich, where his Swiss counterpart said the policy of pegging the franc to the euro was no longer tenable. The markets were impatient for QE, the Swiss central bank chief said \u2013 they have already waited months for a decision.</p> <p>The ECB funds will begin to flow six years after the world\u2019s other major economies adopted QE. The US has spent around $4 trillion, the UK \u00a3375bn, and last year the Japanese promised to spend almost $700bn a year, up from $560bn in 2013.</p> <p>If Draghi goes ahead, the Super-Mario headlines will proliferate across Europe and gigabytes of the web will be devoted to analysing the consequences of the move for the 19-member currency zone \u2013 and for its trading partners, such as the UK.</p> <p>The ECB\u2019s aim is to flood the eurozone banking system with money to boost lending after a collapse in the value of consumer and business borrowing. Draghi\u2019s supporters say the very fact of taking action will increase confidence and invigorate a stuttering economic bloc. According to this argument, Brussels has done little apart from impose austerity. Now, with the ECB throwing its weight behind a strategy for growth, confidence and spending will begin to rise.</p> <p>QE has clearly played a big part in rescuing the global economic system after the crash. But its usefulness as a spur for growth is less clear. As Labour\u2019s Ed Balls has said, governments need to step in with their own funds \u2013 albeit borrowed \u2013 for investment that ensures growth is sustainable.</p> <p>QE is like an adrenalin shot to revive a stricken patient. It is useless when the patient is in recovery and crying out for something more substantial.</p> <p>But persistently printing vast quantities of a currency has one major effect. It drives down its value against other currencies. Since Christmas, the yen has been trading 50% below where it was in October 2012 against the dollar. That means Japanese exports of cars, TVs and kimonos cost 50% less in the US and, just as importantly, in China, which has pegged the renminbi to the dollar.</p> <p>So could the eurozone revive its fortunes on the back of higher exports should, say, \u20ac1tn of QE drive down the euro\u2019s value?</p> <p>It\u2019s unlikely. This kind of currency warfare is usually short-lived and, for that reason, dismissed by corporations that are looking to make long-term investments.</p> <p>Take the UK\u2019s experiment after the financial crash.

      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi, the urbane boss of the European Central Bank, is about to print hundreds of billions of euros to rescue the faltering continental economy. The City expects him to launch his financial bazooka, otherwise known as quantitative easing (QE), on Thursday after the central bank governing council\u2019s monthly meeting. His hand was forced last week by events in Zurich, where his Swiss counterpart said the policy of pegging the franc to the euro was no longer tenable. The markets were impatient for QE, the Swiss central bank chief said \u2013 they have already waited months for a decision. The ECB funds will begin to flow six years after the world\u2019s other major economies adopted QE. The US has spent around $4 trillion, the UK \u00a3375bn, and last year the Japanese promised to spend almost $700bn a year, up from $560bn in 2013. If Draghi goes ahead, the Super-Mario headlines will proliferate across Europe and gigabytes of the web will be devoted to analysing the consequences of the move for the 19-member currency zone \u2013 and for its trading partners, such as the UK. The ECB\u2019s aim is to flood the eurozone banking system with money to boost lending after a collapse in the value of consumer and business borrowing. Draghi\u2019s supporters say the very fact of taking action will increase confidence and invigorate a stuttering economic bloc. According to this argument, Brussels has done little apart from impose austerity. Now, with the ECB throwing its weight behind a strategy for growth, confidence and spending will begin to rise. QE has clearly played a big part in rescuing the global economic system after the crash. But its usefulness as a spur for growth is less clear. As Labour\u2019s Ed Balls has said, governments need to step in with their own funds \u2013 albeit borrowed \u2013 for investment that ensures growth is sustainable. QE is like an adrenalin shot to revive a stricken patient. It is useless when the patient is in recovery and crying out for something more substantial. But persistently printing vast quantities of a currency has one major effect. It drives down its value against other currencies. Since Christmas, the yen has been trading 50% below where it was in October 2012 against the dollar. That means Japanese exports of cars, TVs and kimonos cost 50% less in the US and, just as importantly, in China, which has pegged the renminbi to the dollar. So could the eurozone revive its fortunes on the back of higher exports should, say, \u20ac1tn of QE drive down the euro\u2019s value? It\u2019s unlikely. This kind of currency warfare is usually short-lived and, for that reason, dismissed by corporations that are looking to make long-term investments. Take the UK\u2019s experiment after the financial crash. A mixture of QE and economic weakness triggered a 25% fall in the pound against the dollar and the euro. The Bank of England was among many institutions to naively expect a surge in exports. It never arrived. The low pound persisted for three years before much of the value recovered on the back of home-grown demand. The UK still has a lopsided recovery that relies on consumer spending while business investment and exports remain weak. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, says he recognises the problem and is using a temporary fall in the yen only to ease the pain while fundamental reforms to labour laws and business protections take effect. Draghi serves 19 masters who cannot agree on reforms. So after delivering the QE shot in the arm, it\u2019s not clear what he can do next. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, is not the only senior politician to lobby against QE, saying it will be ineffectual. And with opposition from such powerful figures, it looks like QE will prove to be a one-off that causes huge volatility on the currency exchanges but does little to change the eurozone\u2019s long-term prospects.

They have all grown up with a significant fossil fuel industry and many find it a reassuring presence in the growing new world of renewable power. Hence the kneejerk reaction that has sent ministers from Westminster and Edinburgh rushing to Aberdeen to assure the oil and gas industry that they feel its pain and will find ways to help. No one wants to see jobs being shed anywhere, and a 60% drop in the oil price over a six-month period will be a \u201cnegative shock\u201d to the Scottish economy, as Bank of England governor Mark Carney pointed out.

Morrisons too quick to form firing squad? Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philipscorrect was fired last week when the Bradford-based chain proved to be the real turkey in the supermarket sector over Christmas, with sales down 3.1% in the six weeks to 4 January. But maybe the supermarket\u2019s incoming chairman Andy Higginson was a little hasty.

      "bodyText": "\u2018To make the impossible possible. To rise, and rise\u201d. Uttered in a movie-trailer tone, it sounds like the mission statement for a Mars probe \u2013 but, set against the backdrop of the twinkling lights of night-time London, it\u2019s actually the voiceover for a particularly obnoxious Redrow ad for flats in one of the capital\u2019s now-ubiquitous glass and steel skyscrapers, launched and hastily withdrawn earlier this month after a furious outburst on social media. Its sharply suited, go-getting protagonist is whisked through the streets in a cab, reminiscing about all the hours he had to put in (\u201cthe mornings \u2026 that felt like night\u201d); the calls from mates he was forced to ignore; and the terrible soul-searching he had to endure to succeed (apparently he felt the urge to \u201cbe more than individual\u201d). Without encountering another soul, our hero strides into an anonymous lobby and is whisked up to a vast, sparkling eyrie, worthy of a Bond villain\u2019s hideout. An outraged viewer captured the ad for posterity; rival builder Berkeley Homes pulled its own equally nauseating effort (this one involving a private jet) a few days later. Prices for apartments at One Blackfriars, the tower block being marketed by Berkeley, range up to \u00a323m. And judging by the ad, its lucky inhabitants in their hermetically sealed penthouses will never have to rub shoulders with hoi polloi down at ground level. It\u2019s hard to think of a more powerful symbol of Britain\u2019s divisive, winner-takes-all property market. Of course, the rich have always been with us, and to some extent have always cut themselves off. Strolling through the Geffrye Museum in east London recently, I was intrigued by a painting from 1936. An elegant, bejewelled woman in a shimmering gown peers languorously out on to a crowded London thoroughfare, perhaps Regent Street or Piccadilly, from a plush, warmly lit salon, while a man faces away from the window with studied nonchalance, blowing smoke rings. Only on reading the inscription does it become clear that the lively scene outside the window is not a celebration or a festival, but the arrival of the Jarrow marchers. Britain in the 21st century is a very long way from the Great Depression; yet that well-heeled couple\u2019s cosy imperviousness to their fellow humans\u2019 suffering is all there in the \u201cbecause I\u2019m worth it\u201d high-rise property porn churned out by Redrow, Berkeley and the rest (\u201cThey said nothing comes easy; but if it was easy, then it wouldn\u2019t feel as good,\u201d goes the voiceover). Today\u2019s problems \u2013 the ones to which our well-coiffed City boy is wilfully blind \u2013 are not those of the Jarrow protesters. Unemployment is just 6%. And there is a social safety net \u2013 albeit punctured by vindictive benefits sanctions and patched up by food banks and charity handouts \u2013 that softens the worst consequences of falling out of work. Yet the same crazy market that means you have to \u201cmake the impossible possible\u201d in order to afford a high-rise flat means there are millions of people in perfectly good jobs with no prospect of ever affording a decent place to live \u2013 unacceptable in an economy that George Osborne boasts can be the world\u2019s richest by 2030. In many towns and cities, if you\u2019re earning the average wage or thereabouts, you can \u201caspire\u201d as much as you like, but unless you\u2019ve got a slug of family wealth behind you, you\u2019re never going to get on the property ladder. Research by the Resolution Foundation found that 2.2m working households in Britain with below-median incomes were spending a third or more of disposable income on housing, leaving an average of just \u00a3135 a week for other necessities. Of course, there\u2019s nothing intrinsically wrong with renting. But it can be insecure because of the particular nature of the UK rental market, with its short-term tenancies, landlords\u2019 unbridled right to whack up the rent, and eye-watering fees levied by some lettings agents for doing not very much. Thinktank Civitas, not known as a hotbed of lefties, is arguing for long-term rolling tenancies, under which rents would only rise in line with inflation, so that families living in rented accommodation could plan their finances and avoid the constant risk of eviction. And while we\u2019re at it, why should private landlords receive tax relief on their mortgage interest payments \u2013 so-called Miras \u2013 when struggling first-time buyers do not? Boosting housebuilding, if necessary by public commissioning by local authorities, must be another part of the solution. It must be one of the greatest failures of recent public policy that an entire generation of politicians well knew, and many acknowledged, that \u201cwe aren\u2019t building enough houses\u201d, but did nothing about it. As Osborne put it after delivering his lecture at the Bank of England on Wednesday, \u201cit\u2019s an exhortation to the entire political system: we have got to get more homes built, and if we don\u2019t, we are not meeting the aspirations of the people we claim to represent.\u201d His proposal was a shakeup of planning rules, making it easier for councils to compulsorily purchase land and introducing zoning for brownfield sites, so the presumption would be that they were suitable for housing. That should help; but the supposedly radical planning changes already carried out by the Tories only resulted in 159,990 houses being built last year \u2013 a significant jump since the depths of the crisis, but well below the 200,000-plus seen in the five years before the crash, let alone the 250,000-300,000 many analysts think we will need to keep up with household formation and stabilise prices. Osborne was keen to talk up the idea that the Bank\u2019s new \u201cmacroprudential\u201d toolkit, which allows it to impose loan-to-value limits on mortgages, for example, would prevent future housing bubbles, which have long been a source of instability for the UK economy. He refused to say that flat, or falling, prices are desirable. But polls show that more people would like to see them stabilise or decline than rise. With that in mind, politicians should promise to pull every lever they have \u2013 including planning, regulation and tax \u2013 to ensure that housing is no longer a surefire investment for greedy buy-to-letters, or an accoutrement to a luxury lifestyle, but a place to live. Everyone, not just those who \u201cmake the impossible possible\u201d, deserves a decent home.",

      "bodyText": "Snow and high winds in Scotland have put Katherine Garrett-Cox in the mood for this week\u2019s World Economic Forum in Davos \u2013 the event is held 1,500 metres up a mountain in the Swiss ski resort. The chief executive of Dundee-based Alliance Trust is one of six people co-chairing this year\u2019s gathering, and she has put leadership values and corporate trust at the top of her agenda. World leaders such as Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Italy\u2019s Matteo Renzi will be attending, plus businesspeople including Jack Ma, founder of Chinese web provider Alibaba, and celebrities such as William Adams, better-known as Will.i.am. Of the 2,500 delegates just 17% are female. However Garrett-Cox, 47, who has been at the helm of the 127-year-old investment trust since the onset of the banking crisis in 2008, has seen some improvement in the gender balance since she first came a decade ago, when it was \u201cpretty woeful\u201d. The theme for this year\u2019s five-day gathering is a \u201cnew global context\u201d. Garrett-Cox says: \u201cThe world is an incredibly fragile and somewhat fragmented place, so leaders need to think about how they manage their businesses within that. \u201cOne thing that concerns me a lot is an increasing sense of nationalism and federalism. That is depressing... in a world that is increasingly connected.\u201d At Davos, which she says is always inspiring, she will bump into the bosses of some of the companies Alliance Trust invests in, such as Eric Schmidt of Google or Tidjane Thiam of Prudential. Alliance, which was in the FTSE 100 when she took charge but dropped out four years ago, positions itself as a responsible long-term investor, maintaining that it must also consider climate change, quality of life, sustainable consumption and resilience. \u201cOrganisations need to take account of more than just the numbers when they are managing businesses,\u201d says Garrett-Cox. \u201cSome people fail to recognise that this is not soft fluffy stuff ... This is good business practice.\u201d Alliance Trust is cautious about investing in investment banks: \u201cFirst, the business models are complicated to unpick and, to be quite candid, we are not convinced that some of the cultural changes we want to see in those organisations are yet taking place.\u201d Nor is it keen on natural resources companies \u2013 although the trust has held discussions with companies involved in fracking and in drilling for oil in the Arctic. But, she says, the sliding oil price \u2013 it\u2019s down 60% since last summer \u2013 could be good news for the environment: \u201c[The lower oil price] will put a lot of pressure on people managing those organisations, because it\u2019s simply not economic to get the oil out of the ground with the price where it is.\u201d Garrett-Cox had a string of high-profile jobs before joining Alliance Trust: head of US equities at Hill Samuel at 26, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management, and chief executive at Morley, later Aviva Investors. Her position at Alliance has been threatened during the six years since she became chief executive. She saw off an attempt by activist investor Laxey Partners to overhaul the company, although at the end of last year she herself made changes to the fund management team overseeing \u00a32.6bn of assets to try to bolster its performance. Its shares trade at a 12% discount to the value of the assets, but Garrett-Cox says few companies can beat its track record for paying dividends. She shrugs off challenges to her position, for which she was paid \u00a31.4m in salary and bonuses last year: \u201cAll chief executives have to be quite resilient... It\u2019s important not to get knocked off your path for short-term considerations.\u201d She was appointed chief investment officer of Aberdeen Asset Management in 2000 and there were gasps when she announced shortly afterwards that she was pregnant with her second child and would be off for four months. Now a mother of four, she says such an attitude would not greet female bosses these days. She thinks more should be done to increase the number of women in boardrooms, but adds: \u201cPersonally I have never felt any great discrimination. People talk about a glass ceiling; I have not experienced that. I think sometimes it\u2019s a convenient excuse for people who are not moving as quickly as they want.\u201d Once Davos is over, she will be \u201cfizzing with excitement\u201d after being inspired by unscheduled chats in corridors as well as well as by the formal meetings. And she will use Davos to \u201cspread the word\u201d about Alliance Trust. HOW TO HAVE A GOOD DAVOS Get the right badge Davos is invitation-only, but there is a strict hierarchy, denoted by the colour of your badge. Davos staff wear blue ones, the media orange, technicians purple. The colour determines where in the centre you can go. A coveted white badge means access all areas, but white badge with hologram means really important player. Get a helicopter It is three hours by train from Zurich airport to Davos, 5,000ft up in the Swiss mountains and buried in snow. It takes three trains, although and there is a coach, too, and limos for hire - but the fastest route is by helicopter. The sound of their rotors reverberates around the mountains when the really important people arrive. Get good medical insurance Stories of falls resulting in broken limbs are part of every Davos. Sorry, but buy Swiss francs a week ago The Swiss National Bank\u2019s move to allow the currency to float freely has made a trip to pricey Davos even more expensive. Even before the 30% rise in the Swiss franc leaped against the euro, Davos was already a place designed for company expenses. But as most of the hotels in the Swiss resort require payment in advance, at least the price of a room for the night has not spiralled upwards. Get the party invites in After the daily events in the conference centre, the parties start across the town. They have staggered starts, taking place before and after each evening\u2019s the array of dinners.",
