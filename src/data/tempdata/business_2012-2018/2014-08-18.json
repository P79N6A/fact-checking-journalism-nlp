      "bodyText": "Female bosses are still earning only three-quarters as much as their male colleagues, meaning they would have to work until they were nearly 80 to catch up with men's lifetime earnings, according to new figures. More than 40 years after the Equal Pay Act outlawed less favourable pay and conditions in the workplace, the data shows that discrepancies in salaries widen at the higher echelons of management, with a \"midlife pay crisis\" particularly hitting female managers aged over 40, who earn 35% less than men. The average pay gap between men and women aged between 46 and 60 stands at \u00a316,680 a year, while among company directors men take home \u00a321,084 more than their female colleagues. Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), said: \"This is all about apathy and ignorance. Companies think it is not a problem for them, so they don't do anything about it. Every company needs to conduct its own survey. It is pretty obvious a lot of the FTSE 350 are [paying their female managers less than men] for the data to turn out like this. There are very few good guys.\" Francke said that the likes of the supermarket chain Tesco, which publishes data on its gender pay gap, and the law firm Linklaters, which reveals the percentages of women it employs at different levels, were rare examples of organisations attempting to address the problem. Tesco says its pay gap stands at 1% compared with the national average of 10%, although those figures apply to the whole workforce. The National Management Salary Survey, published annually by the CMI and employment lawyers XpertHR, covers more than 68,000 British professionals and compares data on people at similar levels of management within the workplace. Including male and female managers of all ages, the CMI said that the pay gap stands at \u00a39,069, with men getting an average salary of \u00a339,461 where women get \u00a330,392. \"This means women are earning only three-quarters (77%) of what men in full-time comparable jobs earn,\" the CMI said. \"Yet the gap is far worse for women aged 40-plus, where the problem is twofold. Not only does the salary gap increase with age and seniority, but there is also a persistent \"bonus pay gap\". The average bonus for a female director stands at \u00a341,956, while for male directors the average payout is \u00a353,010.\" The 1970 Equal Pay Act was memorably triggered by the 1968 Ford sewing machinists' strike, which resulted in the workers being summoned to Whitehall by the then employment secretary, Barbara Castle, who brokered a deal. Although the legislation has now been repealed, its provisions are essentially contained within the 2010 Equality Act. Few cases over equal pay have ever been brought to court, although two years ago the Supreme Court did allow 174 mainly female former Birmingham city council workers to press ahead with compensation claims over missed bonuses \u2013 a judgement that has cost the council around \u00a31bn to settle equal pay claims. Helen Pitcher, chair of the human resources consultancy Advanced Boardroom Excellence, said it was unlikely many female bosses would want to take legal action. \"I am not surprised by the findings at all \u2013 and that is no criticism of the report at all,\" she said. \"I wrote my thesis on women in management in the 1980s and very little has changed. The solution is all about transparency. Women often struggle with asking for a pay rise, whereas men don't. I don't think that most women would want to go as far [as taking legal action]. Very few women want to stick their heads above the parapet on this stuff.\" The CMI pay data also shows that under the age of 19, female managers are paid 12% less than male managers, while between the ages of 20 and 25 the figure falls to 6%, before rising again to 8% between 26 and 35. At that point, male managers start earning significantly more than female colleagues in similar jobs. Nicky Morgan, the minister for women and equalities, said: \"Although the gender pay gap remains too high, it is narrowing, and for full-time workers under 40 is almost zero. In 2012, 20% of small and medium-sized businesses were either run solely or mostly by women. I'm pleased that every FTSE 100 board now includes a woman and more businesses are recognising the skills and experience that diversity brings to a workplace.\" Meanwhile, a study earlier this year by US management consultancy Bain &amp; Co found that more women than men start corporate life aiming for the top positions, but that their ambition and confidence is swiftly eroded. The report said: \"Many might assume this drop-off occurs as women get married and have children; however, our analysis suggests that marital and parental status do not significantly differ for women who aspire and women who don't. The picture improves only slightly for more senior female employees. This detailed and segmented trend analysis runs counter to previous, more general research showing that women have aspirations equal to men's\". \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 19 August 2014 to change \"women bosses\" to \"female bosses\" in the headline and throughout.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "David Cameron has been rebuked for claiming that the majority of new jobs created last year were taken by UK nationals when figures for new jobs are not collected by the official statistics body. Sir Andrew Dilnot, head of the UK Statistics Authority, the independent statistics regulator, said the prime minister was wrong to say figures showed that more than three-quarters of all new jobs went to British citizens when \"official statistics do not show the number of new jobs\".\u201f Cameron was attempting to show in an interview for the Daily Telegraph that the government had reversed a situation in its first few years of office when he claimed most new jobs were taken by migrant workers. The interview was widely interpreted as an attempt to win over Ukip voters who believe most jobs created as Britain's economy recovers are being snapped up by foreigners. Following a complaint by Jonathan Portes, head of the National Institute for Economic &amp; Social Research, Dilnot confirmed that neither the original fear that migrants were taking British jobs nor the reversal of this trend were supported by official data. Portes, who has run a campaign to highlight misreported jobs data, said No 10 was not the only culprit and anti-immigration campaigners had for years been arguing that a majority of new jobs went to immigrants. \"This is something that has never been debunked so clearly. Not only is it the case that most jobs have always gone to British nationals, it is still the case,\" he said. Employment data collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) relates to jobs in the economy whether or not they are newly created by employers. Dilnot said the relevant figures from the ONS showed the number of migrants in the labour force increased by 400,000 over the last five years, an 18% rise, while the number of UK nationals increased by 3%, or 900,000. It is not the first time the government has tripped up in its use of statistics. In 2012, Dilnot upheld a complaint by the shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, after the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said expenditure on the NHS was higher in real terms in 2011-12 than in 2009-10, when in fact it was lower. A month later, Cameron was criticised for stating that the coalition was \"paying down Britain's debts\" when he meant the annual deficit. The national debt has risen in each of the financial years of this parliament and the last \u2013 increasing from \u00a3828.7bn, or 57.1% of GDP, to \u00a31.25tn, or 75.7% of GDP, since May 2010. In May 2013, Iain Duncan Smith was rebuked for claiming that 8,000 people had moved into work as a result of the introduction of the benefit cap. A No 10 spokeswoman said: \"Under this government, nearly 70% of the rise in employment has been accounted for by UK nationals. And, as the PM has said, over the last year more than three-quarters of the rise in the number of people in work were UK nationals.\" Dilnot has also written to Chuka Umunna after the shadow business secretary said figures showed there had been a rise in the use of zero-hours contracts, when the figures had been collected in a new format and comparison with past data was impossible.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK taxpayer has been hit with a bill of as much as \u00a350m in compensatory payments to workers laid off incorrectly during insolvencies overseen by Deloitte in the past six years. Figures from The Insolvency Service reveal Deloitte was involved in more than 20 cases where administrators failed to properly consult those being made redundant at failing companies including Woolworths and Comet. Already the government has paid out \u00a318.2m in relation to Woolworths and a further \u00a36.9m relating to a further 20 smaller cases while the business secretary, Vince Cable, has admitted the government could face a further \u00a326m compensation bill in relation to Comet employees after a recent tribunal found Deloitte had failed in its legal duty to properly consult before making redundancies. Those payouts do not include more than \u00a3137m in statutory redundancy payments to staff laid off at failed companies handled by Deloitte administrators in the past six years. The scale of the payouts has been revealed after Cable referred three of Deloitte's most experienced administrators to the accountancy watchdog over their handling of the Comet case. They face an investigation by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) into whether there was a conflict of interest when they accepted the role of administrators, given that they had previously advised the company. Deloitte has disputed that there is a conflict of interest. A spokesman for Cable's office said he \"clearly has concerns about the financial burden placed on the taxpayer when companies collapse\" and those concerns were reflected in the referrals of Deloitte staff to the ICEAW. That referral came 18 months into an ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding Comet's collapse by the Insolvency Service, which has powers to take action against former directors. However, Deloitte has challenged the government's estimate of the cost to the taxpayer from its failure to consult staff at Comet properly and said compensatory payments were common because the system was poorly structured. \"We do not believe the \u00a326m figure quoted in respect of Comet to be correct. We estimate that the maximum possible protective award that could be applied in this case is less than half this amount,\" said a spokesman for the financial services firm. He added: \"Protective payment awards are common and widespread because there are inherent conflicts between employment legislation and insolvency law which the insolvency profession has been grappling with for a number of years. The insolvency trade body, R3, made representations to government on this matter last year.\" R3 has called on the government to amend the law because it says uncertainty about the future of troubled companies means insolvency practitioners cannot easily provide the statutory information about redundancies at the beginning of the process while their financial problems meant that in some cases there was little or no money available to pay for full redundancy consultation. However Mike Cain, a lawyer at Slater &amp; Gordon who acted for former staff in the Comet case, said the rules governing claims already allowed employers not to be held to the full requirements in special circumstances which render it not reasonably practicable for the employer to comply with the rules for consultation. He said: \"It isn't accurate to say that there is some strict and inflexible standard in the law drafted by people who have no real understanding of the reality of managing redundancy or insolvencies. There is a difference between doing what one can in a short timescale on the one hand and doing nothing because time is less than ideal.\" Pressure for change to the law governing insolvencies is coming from several directions. Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, meanwhile, is also demanding a review of the law to protect workers in collapsed companies in the wake of the demise of Comet when nearly 7,000 people were made redundant in 2012. Meanwhile, the government is also aware that its future pay-outs could rise considerably as a result of on-going legal action. At present, UK law limits government redundancy payments to those working in \"establishments\" \u2013 taken to mean individual shops or warehouses \u2013 where more than 20 people work. However, an employment appeal tribunal in Britain has already ruled the \"fewer than 20 workers\" condition should relate to a business as a whole, not individual sites. The government has appealed against that ruling and the case is now headed to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. If the court rules against the government, its potential liability for redundancy payments at insolvent companies when staff have not been properly consulted could soar. Former Comet and Woolworths staff would be among the beneficiaries.",

Deloitte has disputed that there is a conflict of interest.</p> <p>A spokesman for Cable's office said he \"clearly has concerns about the financial burden placed on the taxpayer when companies collapse\" and those concerns were reflected in the referrals of Deloitte staff to the ICEAW.</p> <p>That referral came 18 months into an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/22/deloitte-could-face-prosecution-comet-redundancies\" title=\"\">ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding Comet's collapse by the Insolvency Service, which has powers to take action against former directors</a>.</p> <p>However, Deloitte has challenged the government's estimate of the cost to the taxpayer from its failure to consult staff at Comet properly and said compensatory payments were common because the system was poorly structured.</p> <p>\"We do not believe the \u00a326m figure quoted in respect of Comet to be correct. We estimate that the maximum possible protective award that could be applied in this case is less than half this amount,\" said a spokesman for the financial services firm.</p> <p>He added: \"Protective payment awards are common and widespread because there are inherent conflicts between employment legislation and insolvency law which the insolvency profession has been grappling with for a number of years. The insolvency trade body, R3, made representations to government on this matter last year.\"</p> <p>R3 has called on the government to amend the law because it says uncertainty about the future of troubled companies means insolvency practitioners cannot easily provide the statutory information about redundancies at the beginning of the process while their financial problems meant that in some cases there was little or no money available to pay for full redundancy consultation.</p> <p>However Mike Cain, a lawyer at Slater &amp; Gordon who acted for former staff in the Comet case, said the rules governing claims already allowed employers not to be held to the full requirements in special circumstances which render it not reasonably practicable for the employer to comply with the rules for consultation.</p> <p>He said: \"It isn't accurate to say that there is some strict and inflexible standard in the law drafted by people who have no real understanding of the reality of managing redundancy or insolvencies. There is a difference between doing what one can in a short timescale on the one hand and doing nothing because time is less than ideal.\"</p> <p>Pressure for change to the law governing insolvencies is coming from several directions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/13/comet-workers-win-employment-case-redundancy\" title=\"\">Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, meanwhile, is also demanding a review of the law to protect workers in collapsed companies</a> in the wake of the demise of Comet when nearly 7,000 people were made redundant in 2012.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the government is also aware that its future pay-outs could rise considerably as a result of on-going legal action.</p> <p>At present, UK law limits government redundancy payments to those working in \"establishments\" \u2013 taken to mean individual shops or warehouses \u2013 where more than 20 people work. However, an employment appeal tribunal in Britain has already ruled the \"fewer than 20 workers\" condition should relate to a business as a whole, not individual sites.</p> <p>The government has appealed against that ruling and the case is now headed to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. If the court rules against the government, its potential liability for redundancy payments at insolvent companies when staff have not been properly consulted could soar. Former Comet and Woolworths staff would be among the beneficiaries.</p>",

It might appear that we were back to the \u2018bad old days\u2019, pre-1997, when Chancellors expected to have input into interest rate decisions. It would, indeed, be worse than that because at least the so-called \u2018Ken and Eddie Show\u2019* that preceded the operational independence that Mr Gordon Brown accorded to the BoE was conducted in public, and not under wraps. Mr Carney has probably been well aware from the outset that, since his salary and accommodation allowance are almost three times the remuneration of Lord King of Lothbury, his predecessor, it would be especially important to distance himself from the Chancellor who had appointed him. The BoE has strenuously denied any secret pact with the Treasury over interest rates. The Treasury has also issued a statement confirming the BoE\u2019s independence.</p> <p>Nevertheless, any forward guidance Mr Carney now gives suggesting interest rates will not rise this side of the election would run the risk of confirming suspicions the rate decision had been politicised. That gives the BoE Governor strong reason to slap down market expectations whenever they begin to veer towards the first rise in rates being delayed until well into 2015. His weekend statement that rates could rise, even if real incomes do not, keeps alive, at least notionally, the MPC\u2019s option of raising interest rates before the general election, in February next year or even as early as November this year. In short, Mr Carney has become a central bank head, committed to forward guidance, who would prefer to keep everyone guessing regarding future policy-actions.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarkFieldMP/statuses/501284585036976128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Osborne and Carney hit by interest rate stitch-up row <a href=\"http://t.co/cwccM6ZtKZ\">http://t.co/cwccM6ZtKZ</a> via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CityAM\">@CityAM</a></p>&mdash; Mark Field MP (@MarkFieldMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkFieldMP/statuses/501284585036976128\">August 18, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>* - <em>that\u2019s Ken Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer from 1993-1997, and Eddie George, the governor of the day.</em></p> <p>Lewis concludes that the BoE could ease the tension with a small rate rise soon, if it thinks the economy can bear it, saying:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After all, a rate hike in the near future, even if not followed by another any time soon, would take the question of when the BoE starts to tighten off the table.

Nick Fletcher\u2019s latest market report has details but here are the closing scores: The FTSE 100 finished 52.17 points or 0.78% higher at 6741.25 Germany\u2019s Dax added 1.68% to 9245.33 France\u2019s Cac closed up 1.35% at 4230.65 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended 0.82% better at 19,639.90 Spain\u2019s Ibex rose 1.28% to 10,353.4 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up just over 1% or 176 points, while the pound is at $1.6720. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a rather quiet afternoon, so here\u2019s a recap. Two MPs have accused the Bank of England of making a secret pact with the Treasury not to raise interest rates before next May\u2019s general election. City of London MP Mark Field, a Conservative, claimed there is a \u201cpolitical imperative\u201d to keep rates low. He said: \u201cFrom the moment Mark Carney became governor in July 2013, it was pretty clear forward guidance was an indication rates would not rise this side of the election \u2013 for all the talk of Bank of England independence, there was a clear bargain between him and George Osborne.\u201d \u201cIn my view, politically nothing has changed. What is best for Carney is not to have running commentary \u2013 which Kremlinologists in the City try to work out\u2026 the political imperative is to keep rates as low as possible.\u201d Labour\u2019s John Mann has added his weight, saying the BoE wants to delay rate rises until just after the election. The Treasury and the BoE deny the claims, insisting that Threadneedle Street is taking decisions without political interference. Sterling has gained value today, after governor Mark Carney reignited speculation that interest rates could rise this year. He told the Sunday Times that the first hike in borrowing costs could some even if real wages remained negative (ie, were rising less fast than inflation). That pushed the pound up by 0.4 cents against the US dollar, to $1.673. Carney\u2019s comments have baffled some in the City; only last week, the Bank indicated that it was unlikely to start raising rates until real wages were rising. Stephen Lewis of ADM Investor Services reckons Carney is trying to keep the markets guessing. He wrote: Any forward guidance Mr Carney now gives suggesting interest rates will not rise this side of the election would run the risk of confirming suspicions the rate decision had been politicised. That gives the BoE Governor strong reason to slap down market expectations whenever they begin to veer towards the first rise in rates being delayed until well into 2015. Michael Hewson of City firm CMC Market fears that the Bank of England is losing its grip: In fact it would appear that the only thing Mr Carney and the MPC are increasingly certain of, is that the outlook is uncertain, and that they have no more of a clue than the rest of us, which isn\u2019t exactly comforting. Economics editor Larry Elliott says the comments could suggest the minutes of the last MPC meeting, due on Wednesday, will show a split (either that or Carney is floundering). In other news: Germany\u2019s Bundesbank has admitted that eurozone growth will be weaker than expected this year. The eurozone trade surplus has widened, led by Germany A bidding war has broken out over American discount chain Family Dollar. Holiday airline Monarch is cutting up to 1,000 jobs Nationwide has reported a surge in profits, but a drop in mortgage lending And boardroom pay continues to outpace the rest of the economy, with the typical CEO earning almost 150 times their average workers. What\u2019s to be done? Shares have risen on Wall Street at the start of trading, as investors respond to the easing in geopolitical tensions (see earlier). The Dow Jones has risen by 104 points to 16768, up 0.6%. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained 0.5% to its highest level since 2000, at the end of the dot-com crash. European markets are also holding onto this morning\u2019s gains - with the FTSE 100 up 44 points at 6733, and the French and German markets up around 1.3%. The bandwagon is rolling..... A second MP has accused the Bank of England of holding back from raising interest rates until after next May\u2019s general election. Labour MP John Mann, who has clashed with Mark Carney in the past, said: \u201cIt is abundantly clear that Mark Carney is attempting to delay interest rate increases until after the election when they rise immediately.\u201d (via the Evening Standard) Mann\u2019s comments echo those of Mark Field, Conservative MP for the City of London. The Bank and Treasury continue to insist, though, that Britain\u2019s central bank is completely independent. John Mann probably wasn\u2019t close to Mark Carney\u2019s Christmas card list -- last November, the governor appeared quite offended after Mann said he was too close to George Osborne, and was playing with politics by talking up the UK economy. Workers at UK holidays airline operator Monarch have been hit with the news that up to 1,000 jobs are being cut. Monarch is shrinking its workforce by a third, and reducing its aeroplane fleet, as it reinvents itself as a scheduled European budget airline. More here: Monarch to cut 1,000 jobs as airline seeks take off as low-cost carrier There is another theory to explain Mark Carney\u2019s latest zig-zagging; the governor may be preparing us for Wednesday, when the minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee\u2019s most recent meeting are released. There\u2019s a decent chance that at least one MPC member voted to raise interest rates -- which would be the first split since 2011. Our economics editor Larry Elliott writes: It was clear from last week\u2019s Inflation Report that there is division on the MPC about the amount of spare capacity in the economy and the rate at which that slack is being used up. That\u2019s the best gloss that can be put on the governor\u2019s latest pronouncement. It would now be a real surprise \u2013 and a blow to Carney\u2019s credibility \u2013 were the minutes to show a 9-0 vote in favour of keeping borrowing costs unchanged. Why? Because a split vote would mean that the governor was putting the markets on notice for a hawkish set of minutes. A unanimous vote would give the unfortunate impression that he is making it up as he goes along. Perish the thought.... More here: Why is Mark Carney keeping financial markets guessing on timing of rate rise? Over in America, a takeover battle has broken out in the discount store world: Stephen Lewis, chief economist of ADM Investor Services, has published an interesting note on UK interest rate policy and Mark Carney\u2019s suggestion that borrowing costs could rise before real incomes recover. He explains that Carney now faces a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d, in which his data-dependent forward guidance is being scrutinised for signs that political pressure is keeping rates down (as MP Mark Field claims today). Lewis reckons, therefore, that the governor is trying to scupper the idea that rates definitely won\u2019t rise in 2014, given the weak outlook for earnings: If it became the common belief that the BoE\u2019s decisions had been politicised, the result might be extremely damaging to the credibility of the BoE\u2019s monetary policy. It might appear that we were back to the \u2018bad old days\u2019, pre-1997, when Chancellors expected to have input into interest rate decisions. It would, indeed, be worse than that because at least the so-called \u2018Ken and Eddie Show\u2019* that preceded the operational independence that Mr Gordon Brown accorded to the BoE was conducted in public, and not under wraps. Mr Carney has probably been well aware from the outset that, since his salary and accommodation allowance are almost three times the remuneration of Lord King of Lothbury, his predecessor, it would be especially important to distance himself from the Chancellor who had appointed him. The BoE has strenuously denied any secret pact with the Treasury over interest rates. The Treasury has also issued a statement confirming the BoE\u2019s independence. Nevertheless, any forward guidance Mr Carney now gives suggesting interest rates will not rise this side of the election would run the risk of confirming suspicions the rate decision had been politicised. That gives the BoE Governor strong reason to slap down market expectations whenever they begin to veer towards the first rise in rates being delayed until well into 2015. His weekend statement that rates could rise, even if real incomes do not, keeps alive, at least notionally, the MPC\u2019s option of raising interest rates before the general election, in February next year or even as early as November this year. In short, Mr Carney has become a central bank head, committed to forward guidance, who would prefer to keep everyone guessing regarding future policy-actions. * - that\u2019s Ken Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer from 1993-1997, and Eddie George, the governor of the day. Lewis concludes that the BoE could ease the tension with a small rate rise soon, if it thinks the economy can bear it, saying: After all, a rate hike in the near future, even if not followed by another any time soon, would take the question of when the BoE starts to tighten off the table. However, confidence is probably fragile, and could become more so if, as we expect, the UK economy slows significantly in the remaining months of this year. The window of opportunity for such bold tactics is already closing. But politics IS a factor \u2013 even without a secret pact with George Osborne, the Bank might not fancy raising borrowing costs shortly before the nation heads to the polls in May 2015. \u201cDespite Mr Carney\u2019s weekend comment, the odds still weigh on the side of the first rate hike\u2019s happening later rather than sooner,\u201d Lewis concludes. Reuters has a good summary of the pound\u2019s mini-rally this morning: Sterling was the main mover on major currency markets on Monday, recovering from last week\u2019s multi-month lows after the Bank of England said interest rates might have to rise before wage inflation picks up. The dollar, knocked back last week after a strong run since early July, was roughly steady against the yen and euro and a basket of currencies used to measure its broader strength, hampered by U.S. Treasury yields that were close to 16-month lows. Sterling rose after BoE Governor Mark Carney said in a newspaper interview that UK rates may have to increase even before the growth of real wages recovers, backtracking from comments last week that suggested the opposite and prompted markets to push back bets on a first hike. \u201cThe comments in the (Sunday) Times were definitely a surprise to markets and that\u2019s what is behind this move this morning,\u201d said Adam Myers, head of European FX strategy with Credit Agricole in London. The pound has taken a hammering over the past month, hurt by the suspicion that all of the best news on the UK economy has been priced in and that the bank might not be quite as quick as some had expected to raise rates. After a sixth straight weekly loss against the dollar, it gained around a third of a percent against the euro and the dollar in early European deals, trading at 79.97 pence per euro and $1.6733. City trading firm Abshire-Smith says Mark Carney risks confusing the markets by changing the tone of his comments over monetary policy. They agree that Sunday\u2019s newspaper interview is rather more hawkish than the governor\u2019s comments at last week\u2019s inflation report. As traders attempt to gauge the timeline of interest rate hikes, the contradictory comments has led to criticism of Carney. Is the central bank governor playing a dangerous game of leaving the base interest rate at a record low at the risk of inflation, while verbally confusing traders? More here: Is Mark Carney Confused? Back on housing.... this chart shows how annual price growth in the UK and US has eased a little this summer, while China\u2019s economy has been cooling for some months: Germany\u2019s central bank has admitted that the eurozone economy is performing more poorly than previously anticipated. In its latest monthly report, the Bundesbank predicted that the eurozone will grow in the rest of 2014, having slumped into stagnation in the April-June quarter (as we learned last week), but at a slower rate. It says: Following second-quarter stagnation, the euro area is looking at a resumption of positive economic growth, albeit not at the pace predicted by many analysts in the spring. The Bundesbank also admitted that the outlook for Germany\u2019s economy (which actually shrank in the last quarter) is less rosy than predicted in the spring. Sentiment in the German economy has deteriorated, it said, but the overall trend for domestic demand remains \u201cupwards\u201d, meaning \u201cthe economy will not change direction\u201d.

Eurostat reports that the euro area ran a surplus of \u20ac16.8bn in June, up from \u20ac15.7bn in June 2013. Exports are up by 3% year-on-year, while imports only rose 2%. Imports have been steadily lagging since the eurozone crisis erupted, reflecting the drop in domestic demand in weaker members of the currency union, especially those hit by austerity. Germany, unsurprisingly, has posted the biggest surplus so far this year -- at +\u20ac84.0bn in January- May 2014, followed by the Netherlands with +\u20ac25.2 bn), then Ireland and Italy (both +\u20ac14.1 bn). Across the EU, the United Kingdom (-\u20ac48.1 bn) registered the largest deficit, followed by France (-\u20ac30.4 bn), Spain (-\u20ac10.1 bn) and Greece (-\u20ac8.8 bn). Correction: that should read $102.13 per barrel of Brent Crude.... The oil price has fallen this morning, amid hopes that the Russia-Ukraine talks in Berlin could deliver progress. Brent crude is down by $1.40 per barrel, to $102.13 (corrected). The latest military action in Iraq also pushed down the oil price. Overnight, Kurdish peshmerga fighters regained control of the strategically important Mosul dam from ISIS fighters, helped by US air strikes. Some economists had feared that geopolitical crises would cause the oil price to spike, wiping out global economic growth. However, other analysts have warned that a lower oil price will hurt Russia\u2019s economy, by eroding the value of its exports.... Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG, says the BoE governor is \u201cup to his old tricks again\u201d, after indicating that the Bank might not wait for wages to outpace inflation before raising interest rates. He says: Similarities between George Clooney and Mark Carney have often been noted, and the Canadian\u2019s latest avoidance tactics when it comes to commitment would no doubt get George\u2019s seal of approval. Not that the future Mr Alamuddin is an unreliable boyfriend, of course! Adam Myers, head of European FX strategy with Credit Agricole, confirms that Mark Carney\u2019s latest guidance on interest rates have caught traders out again. Myers says (via Reuters): \u201cThe comments in the (Sunday) Times were definitely a surprise to markets and that\u2019s what is behind this move this morning,\u201d The pound has now gained 0.4 of a cent against the US dollar, to $1.6732. Not a massive move, of course, but it does take sterling away from the four-month low hit last week. A new survey of boardroom remuneration has found that the average FTSE 100 boss took home almost 150 times as much as their average employee last year. And some well-known businessmen really coined it, as my colleague Juliette Garside reports: WPP founder, Sir Martin Sorrell, received nearly \u00a330m last year, 780 times the \u00a338,000 earned by his average worker. At Next, Lord Wolfson received \u00a34.6m, while his staff, most of whom work on the shop floor, typically took home \u00a310,000 \u2013 about 459 times less than their boss. Full story: CEOs earning 143 times more than company averages, pay study shows Defenders of the free market would probably claim that Sorrell and Wolfson are worth every penny (they\u2019ve both done a pretty decent job over the years, to be fair). But such whopping pay packets, when average real wages are shrinking, will only drive income inequality (and leave a little less in the pot for shareholders too). Could a pay cap, limiting bosses to a certain multiple, be the answer, or would it just drive bosses overseas? Poll: should the UK introduce a pay ratio ceiling to curb executive pay? UK building society Nationwide has given a signal that Britain\u2019s housing market is cooling, even as it counts the profits from the recent boom. Nationwide reported that gross mortgage lending in the last quarter dropped by almost 10%, to \u00a35.8bn from \u00a36.4bn a year ago. It cited new affordability tests introduced this spring, which had \u201cimpacted\u201d customer behaviour. As flagged up earlier, online estate agent Rightmove reported that average asking prices fell 2.9% this month, the biggest fall since at least 2001. The prospect of interest rate rises may also have hit demand, of course \u2013 with potential housebuyers trying to anticipate when, and how, borrowing costs will rise. It\u2019s been a decent quarter for Nationwide otherwise, though. Underlying earnings more than doubled in the three months to June 30, to \u00a3263m. It\u2019s a similar tale at housebuilder Bovis Homes this morning \u2013 it reported a 150% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a349.4m in the half of 2014. Mark Carney\u2019s hint that interest rates could rise even if real wages are still shrinking won\u2019t comfort those who already fear the Bank of England hasn\u2019t got a grip on the situation. So reckons Michael Hewson of CMC Markets, who comments: Last week the governor of the Bank of England and the MPC were accused of being clueless on a scale of certainty and cluelessness about the state of the economy, which prompted Carney to respond that the range was probably between perfect certainty and perfect uncertainty. Those weekend comments will only add to the perception of a conflicted central bank. In fact it would appear that the only thing Mr Carney and the MPC are increasingly certain of, is that the outlook is uncertain, and that they have no more of a clue than the rest of us, which isn\u2019t exactly comforting. A flurry of optimism over the Ukraine crisis has pushed up European stock markets at the start of trading. The German DAX and French CAC both jumped almost 1.5%, while the FTSE 100 index is up 48 points, gaining 0.7% to 6737. Investors are hoping that today\u2019s meeting between Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in Berlin could deliver a breakthrough to calm geopolitical tensions in the region. It\u2019s not a given, though - Ukraine\u2019s Pavlo Klimkin has already tweeted that \u201cthe talks will not be easy.\u201d The Bank of England has robustly denied that there is a secret \u201cstitch-up\u201d pact between Mark Carney and chancellor George Osborne to resist hiking interest rates before the election. Conservative MP Mark Field made the remarkable claim to City AM, which understandably slapped it all over page 1. Field, who represents the City of London, declared: \u201cFrom the moment Mark Carney became governor in July 2013, it was pretty clear forward guidance was an indication rates would not rise this side of the election \u2013 for all the talk of Bank of England independence, there was a clear bargain between him and George Osborne.\u201d \u201cIn my view, politically nothing has changed. What is best for Carney is not to have running commentary \u2013 which Kremlinologists in the City try to work out\u2026 the political imperative is to keep rates as low as possible.\u201d The Bank didn\u2019t appreciate its precious independence being dismissed so casually, insisting that there\u2019s never been such an agreement. And a Treasury source dismissed Field\u2019s claim as \u201cutterly false\u201d. Nice front page, though. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at Daily FX, agrees that Mark Carney appears to have changed his tune again... Carney said the economy is \u201cmuch more than halfway\u201d to full economic recovery and argued interest rates may have to rise before wages, seemingly contradicting rhetoric released in the quarterly Inflation Report just last week. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and business. The pound is rallying this morning, after the Bank of England governor hinted that interest rates could rise even if British wages haven\u2019t climbed above inflation. Mark Carney told The Sunday Times that workers should prepare for higher borrowing costs even if their own pay packets are still being eroded by inflation. He said: We have to have the confidence that real wages are going to be growing sustainably [before rates go up]. We don\u2019t have to wait for the fact of that turn to do so. More here: Interest rates will rise before real pay stops falling, says Carney That hint is pushing up the value of sterling this morning. The pound has gained 0.3 of a cent, or 0.2%, against the US dollar to $1.6723. Despite the recovery, UK wages are currently growing at their weakest rate since at least 2001 (and actually shrinking if you include bonuses). Last week, the BoE had indicated that rates were unlikely to rise before real wages were growing. That bolstered expectations that the first hike would not come until 2015. So, Carney\u2019s comments to the Sunday Times have prompted a rethink in the City. Once again, the governor appears to be shifting the goalposts -- or living up (down?) to his reputation as an \u201cUnreliable Boyfriend\u201d..... What else is afoot?... It looks like a fairly quiet start to the week. European stock markets are expected to rise, but remain closely linked to events in the Middle East and Ukraine. We get a fresh health-check on the stagnating European economy this morning, when the eurozone trade balance for June is published at 10am BST. And the latest housing surveys have shown property prices falling in the UK and China: Record August slump in house prices - Guardian China\u2019s property prices skid further in July - Marketwatch I\u201dll be tracking the main developments through the day.....",

      "bodyText": "What's got into the whisky at the Institute of Directors? The bosses' organisation never used to be in the vanguard of voices condemning egregious pay abuses and boardroom power grabs. Suddenly it is. It was among the first to point out that Barclays' bonus pool last year was three times as large as the total sum of dividends paid to shareholders. \"For whom is this institution being run?\" it asked. At Sports Direct, the IoD said the board's attempt to push through a big pay award for Mike Ashley suggested there was \"no effective check\" on the founder's power. Other big public companies to feel the lash of its tongue include Experian, Burberry, Bumi, Essar Energy and Eurasian Natural Resources. The brief was even extended to Fifa. World football's governing body was described on the eve of the World Cup as \"unaccountable and dysfunctional\", though it's doubtful Fifa president Sepp Blatter cares one jot about what they say about him in Pall Mall. Simon Walker, director general since October 2011, argues the IoD is following principles established a century ago by royal charter. These include the promotion of good governance, boardroom integrity and professionalisation of the job of being a company director. \"We are trying to get back to the focus on governance, on running companies better and in the interests of stakeholders broadly, in the climate we are in today. \"Competition and the market have, in my view, brought greater benefits to humanity than any other movement ever and we need to remind people about that. But we also need to make sure that it is competitive and is run in the interests of all its participants. That is what governance is all about. It is about running a business properly and in accordance with its professed purpose for all its stakeholders.\" What is different from the past, however, is the IoD is prepared to single out major companies for criticism. The CBI, the other major business organisation with a royal charter, rarely does that. \"We have been quite specific and I see no need to resile from that,\" says Walker. \"We have a huge advantage in that we are an organisation of 38,000 individual members, each of whom carries the same weight and pays the same subscription. I fully understand that other organisations that have corporate membership don't have the same luxury in the same sense.\" No IoD member has resigned because of a stance taken on pay or governance, says Walker: \"We have had a lot of positive comment on criticism of excessive pay in big companies in general, and banks in particular, and the membership has been as critical as any newspaper.\" He says he received most protest from the ranks when he argued on the BBC against the stripping of Fred Goodwin's knighthood. A prison sentence is normally required to remove a person's gong and, since Goodwin was never convicted of any offence (or even charged), Walker, a former communications secretary at Buckingham Palace, was offended by \"the wholly inappropriate denial of process\". He felt obliged to write to IoD members to explain that he really wasn't defending RBS or banks. Companies \"engage with us, reply, they make their case\" when criticised by the IoD, says Walker. He makes it sound polite. In private, some are furious about their rebukes. The High Pay Centre calculated this week that the bosses of Britain's top companies were paid on average 143 times as much as their workers. But Walker's argument is not against high pay in general, but against excessive pay, particularly when skewed incentives distort executives' behaviour. \"I have no problem with high pay in principle. I do think pay for top executive jobs has lost any sense of proportion. I am not one to focus \u2013 like the High Pay Centre \u2013 on ratios, because \"fairness\" and \"fair\" are not words that I bandy about. But excess, it seems to me, is clear and has been for decades; a decade certainly.\" He blames, in part, the focus on \"shareholder value\", famously described in retirement by Jack Welch, once regarded as an arch exponent at General Electric, as \"the dumbest idea in the world\". Walker says: \"A lot of it goes back to the concept of encouraging top executives to run companies on the basis of earnings expectations, rather than running real businesses. And that is wrong and has had very damaging effects.\" He cites another famous admission, from Peter Voser, who said after his departure as chief executive of Shell that if he had been paid half as much he wouldn't have run the company any worse and if he had been paid twice as much he wouldn't have run it any better. The moral of that tale, says Walker, is: \"If you hire top, able, talented people, which you should do, and hold them to account, they will do a fundamentally decent job.\" The problem lies in skewed incentives that encourage \"exotic\" behaviour. \"A company is not just about short-term profit and shareholder gain.\" What would Walker \u2013 whose salary is \u00a3300,000 a year \u2013 regard as reasonable pay for a chief executive of a mid-ranking FTSE 100 company successfully discharging its responsibilities to shareholders and society? \"I would be reluctant to magic up a figure. It would clearly be a very large sum of money. But it is the variability and the capriciousness that strikes me as wrong.\" He says he understands \"the dilemmas\" facing remuneration committees because: \"A chief executive who rebuilds a company near collapse can make an extraordinary difference.\" Walker was communications director of Reuters from 2002 to 2007 and thinks his old boss there, Tom Glocer, helped save the media giant from collapse during its crisis years. The point, though, is that: \"Not all business leadership is fundamentally a rescue mission.\" Do not think, however, that the IoD wants the government to intervene on boardroom pay. On that issue, it is as attuned to market principles as one would expect. \"It is fundamentally for shareholders to be asking these questions.\" The most high-profile rebellion during this year's season of annual meetings was at Burberry, where 52% voted against a pay report that showed new chief executive Christopher Bailey, the company's design guru, had been given \u00a320m-worth of shares not tied to performance. The IoD's view is that the company should respond. \"Burberry has clearly been run extraordinarily well for many years,\" says Walker. \"Now does that justify the extraordinary pay package that is conjured up for a man who is clearly an outstanding talent but is yet unproven [as chief executive]? Well, clearly most shareholders think it doesn't.\" He applies the same shareholders-first thinking to foreign takeovers. The IoD was fiercely against any government intervention to block Pfizer's ultimately failed attempt to buy AstraZeneca. \"We weren't on Pfizer's side,\" says Walker. \"We were just against government having a role.\" But haven't fund managers, with a few exceptions, shown themselves to be pusillanimous on excess pay? \"It may be that shareholders are pusillanimous because they haven't had any power,\" replies Walker. \"In that sense I think what government has done in giving them a binding vote is appropriate.\" He wonders whether fund managers could be pushed harder to apply stewardship principles. Trinity Mirror, he argues, was led by \"a charismatic and media-smiled-upon CEO [Sly Bailey]\" but \"ran itself into the ground without shareholders asking fundamental questions\". He adds: \"I am not a lawyer, but if there were civil remedies available against pension funds because they have been listless and apathetic in the way they engaged with companies in which they had large positions \u2013 that could be quite a constructive way to nudge shareholder activism. At the end of the day, this is your pension and my pension. It is not money held by rich titans on their own behalf.\" The deeper issue, he argues, is about accountability in the boardroom. \"I do deplore the extent to which public discourse about corporate governance has become about pay. Of course it matters. Of course remuneration incentives are important, but there are many more important issues. Questions about 'Where was the board?' on critical decision-making around, say, RBS's strategy as Fred Goodwin led it over the cliff, or Barclays' as it nearly outbid RBS for ABN Amro in 2007. The question is: Where the hell's the board in all this? \"What we know about those boards, for example, is that they included some of the most distinguished business people Britain has ever produced. What's wrong? It's the need for boards to be doing their job in a vastly more activist, questioning way in terms of holding overweening CEOs and management generally to account at the right time.\"",

Britons sell property to maximise their financial gains almost as much as they sell when a new job beckons in another town or they need to downsize following retirement or divorce.

So it must have been disappointing for investors that property website Rightmove has reported a 2.9% drop in asking prices across the country between July and August.

Yet if property investors furrowed their brows, it can only be that they misread their own behaviour and how it drives prices.

By contrast, buyers were flooding into estate agents buoyed by forecasts that interest rates would stay low for years. Now we have a situation in reverse. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, is judging the situation month by month. There could be a rise this year, next or the year after. This causes uncertainty and the withdrawal of some buyers. Hence the panic among sellers, who thought July was finally the month to sell.

There is no debate whether they should be in the room or not, they obviously should.\" Burke, who joined the Co-op in February, is also a non-executive at the BBC on the board in charge of day-to-day operations. He is also a former chairman of the Irish supermarket chain Superquinn and Mitchells &amp; Butlers, the pub and restaurant group. His comments follow criticism of the Co-op's planned overhaul, after recommendations by the City veteran Lord Myners that the board should be cleared of all democratically elected members. The Institute of Directors also raised concerns about the ability of the board to exercise independent oversight with members included. The Co-op's board is currently populated entirely by Co-op members, but under the planned reforms their number would be cut to three. Myners, the former City minister, was brought in to lead an overhaul after the organisation slumped to its loss of \u00a32.5bn, its worst ever, and was forced to give up control of its banking arm after admitting catastrophic mismanagement. Its former chairman Paul Flowers had quit days before it emerged that regulators had found a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall at the bank. But Myners encountered fierce resistance to his plans and quit the board in May. The Co-op's compromise proposal will slash the number of board seats from 18 to 11, which will include three elected members, five \"professional\" independent non-executive directors and two executive directors including the chief executive. A separate 100-strong council, led by a president elected for two years, will represent members and act as guardian of the mutual's values. Communication with the main board will be channelled through a senate with 10-15 members, elected by the council. The proposals will be put to a vote at a special meeting on 30 August. Some members remain unhappy about the idea of appointing \"professional\" non-executive directors whose values may be at odds with the traditional ethos of the Co-op. But Burke said he had joined the group's food board because he believed in the mutual model and thought it was \"well worth saving\". \"There is no reason it can't be successful in future, with reform,\" Burke said. He also said he understood the fears of members about outsiders bringing a City-focused agenda into the group, but said they were more likely to bring a valuable fresh perspective. \"Lots of professional non-executives and City types don't see beyond the plc network, but they are very unlikely to go for positions on the Co-op board. The majority of people who put themselves forward will be of like mind to me,\" he said. Burke said the biggest benefit of the new structure was the simplicity and clarity of the remit of the two boards. \"Dividing responsibilities among multiple structures is never a good idea. One of the difficulties the BBC trust and board has given us over the years is that it has never really been clear who is responsible for running the BBC.\" He said the Co-op's proposed new structure was essential to speed up decision making to allow the food business to improve its operations in a very competitive market. \"There is no time to lose \u2013 we have to be very fleet of foot about this. Our competitors are not going to give us breathing space to carry this out at our leisure.\"",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "The shale boom is a bubble waiting to burst as economics of extraction falter and the trickle of bad environmental news starts to swell", 
      "body": "<p>The vision of an energy-independent Britain, free of the clear and growing problems of overseas fuel dependency, is deeply alluring. That is one of the reasons I set up a solar energy company 15 years ago. Today, Putin's Russia, Islamic State's Iraq, and a host of other actual and potential fossil-fuel addiction downsides mean we would be well advised to strive hard for that vision. What is becoming clearer with each passing month, however, is that the route to delivering energy independence is not the fracking of domestic gas and oil from shale. Indeed, it could be a route to derailing the vision.</p> <p>Five sets of problems are emerging with the shale narrative: economic risk; local environmental cost; global environmental cost; social cost, and opportunity cost.</p> <p>First, the economic risk. The US \"shale boom\" looks increasingly as though it will turn into one of those bubbles that we humans seem so good at inflating and then bursting. The oil-and-gas industry has been <a href=\"http://qz.com/238686/is-there-a-fracking-bubble/\" title=\"\">losing cash by the tens of billions</a>, because high drilling costs mean most companies are spending more than they are earning from low-price fracked gas, even when high-price fracked oil is added to the equation. Wider US industry may have benefited from cheap gas in the short term, but <a href=\"http://www.jeremyleggett.net/2014/01/9876/\" title=\"\">production from all shale gas regions \u2013 save the Marcellus of Pennsylvania \u2013 has peaked already</a>, and many of us reading the detail now see little prospect of the gas industry delivering growing production for many years more. Rather, the reverse.</p> <p>Second, the local environmental cost. Once Dick Cheney freed fracking from scrutiny under America's Safe Drinking Water Act (the so-called \"Halliburton Loophole\"), back in the kick-off days for shale in the Bush years, bad news about contamination and health impacts should have been predictable. It has been slow to emerge, in part because of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/aug/05/children-ban-talking-about-fracking\" title=\"\">widespread use of gagging orders</a> by the industry as part of compensation payments for wrecked farms and impaired health. But now <a href=\"http://www.jeremyleggett.net/tag/shale-gas/\" title=\"\">a regular drip of bad news has started</a>, soon likely to snowball as ever more people realise the reality behind the industry's mantras about all being well.</p> <p>Third, the global environmental cost. Gas industry operations can and do leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from wellhead to hob. The question is, how much? Early research on fracking-related emissions by the rare university teams not cowed by oil-industry funding are worrying. Fracked gas may well prove to be worse than coal in greenhouse terms, over the full-life-cycle. And British shale basins are far more faulted than US shale basins.</p> <p>Fourth, the social cost. It is likely that few British people as yet fully appreciate the tight well spacings, industrial infrastructure, water profligacy, toxic waste-disposal challenges, and lorry movements that are required for a typical US shale \"sweet spot\", and what the social cost of that would be if superimposed on rural Britain. Yet already local opposition is severe, even against single vertical unfracked test wells, which entail little waste, and few lorry movements. Planning for the first such was rejected by a council for the first time recently, in Sussex, with <a href=\"http://www.westsussextoday.co.uk/news/county-news/latest-news/breaking-news-plans-for-exploratory-drilling-between-wisborough-green-and-kirdford-rejected-1-6192796\" title=\"\">objectors \"weeping with relief\"</a> in the chamber on hearing the decision.</p> <p>Many such objectors are Conservative voters. The prime minister says he wants to deliver sufficient shale gas to drive down the gas price so far that large-scale manufacturing returns to the UK. He has little or no chance of getting that past his own voter base without committing political suicide, even if much of that gas proves extractable by fracking \u2013 which the British Geological Survey clearly has doubts about.</p> <p>Fifth, the opportunity cost. There is a shovel-ready alternative to gas that can be developed surprisingly quickly, given the collective will: renewable energy and energy efficiency. Among this broad family is a star duo that the energy incumbency increasingly fears as an existential threat: solar and storage. Solar is a power source that is infinite and easy to tap, as opposed to finite and increasingly difficult to tap.

      "bodyText": "The vision of an energy-independent Britain, free of the clear and growing problems of overseas fuel dependency, is deeply alluring. That is one of the reasons I set up a solar energy company 15 years ago. Today, Putin's Russia, Islamic State's Iraq, and a host of other actual and potential fossil-fuel addiction downsides mean we would be well advised to strive hard for that vision. What is becoming clearer with each passing month, however, is that the route to delivering energy independence is not the fracking of domestic gas and oil from shale. Indeed, it could be a route to derailing the vision. Five sets of problems are emerging with the shale narrative: economic risk; local environmental cost; global environmental cost; social cost, and opportunity cost. First, the economic risk. The US \"shale boom\" looks increasingly as though it will turn into one of those bubbles that we humans seem so good at inflating and then bursting. The oil-and-gas industry has been losing cash by the tens of billions, because high drilling costs mean most companies are spending more than they are earning from low-price fracked gas, even when high-price fracked oil is added to the equation. Wider US industry may have benefited from cheap gas in the short term, but production from all shale gas regions \u2013 save the Marcellus of Pennsylvania \u2013 has peaked already, and many of us reading the detail now see little prospect of the gas industry delivering growing production for many years more. Rather, the reverse. Second, the local environmental cost. Once Dick Cheney freed fracking from scrutiny under America's Safe Drinking Water Act (the so-called \"Halliburton Loophole\"), back in the kick-off days for shale in the Bush years, bad news about contamination and health impacts should have been predictable. It has been slow to emerge, in part because of widespread use of gagging orders by the industry as part of compensation payments for wrecked farms and impaired health. But now a regular drip of bad news has started, soon likely to snowball as ever more people realise the reality behind the industry's mantras about all being well. Third, the global environmental cost. Gas industry operations can and do leak methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from wellhead to hob. The question is, how much? Early research on fracking-related emissions by the rare university teams not cowed by oil-industry funding are worrying. Fracked gas may well prove to be worse than coal in greenhouse terms, over the full-life-cycle. And British shale basins are far more faulted than US shale basins. Fourth, the social cost. It is likely that few British people as yet fully appreciate the tight well spacings, industrial infrastructure, water profligacy, toxic waste-disposal challenges, and lorry movements that are required for a typical US shale \"sweet spot\", and what the social cost of that would be if superimposed on rural Britain. Yet already local opposition is severe, even against single vertical unfracked test wells, which entail little waste, and few lorry movements. Planning for the first such was rejected by a council for the first time recently, in Sussex, with objectors \"weeping with relief\" in the chamber on hearing the decision. Many such objectors are Conservative voters. The prime minister says he wants to deliver sufficient shale gas to drive down the gas price so far that large-scale manufacturing returns to the UK. He has little or no chance of getting that past his own voter base without committing political suicide, even if much of that gas proves extractable by fracking \u2013 which the British Geological Survey clearly has doubts about. Fifth, the opportunity cost. There is a shovel-ready alternative to gas that can be developed surprisingly quickly, given the collective will: renewable energy and energy efficiency. Among this broad family is a star duo that the energy incumbency increasingly fears as an existential threat: solar and storage. Solar is a power source that is infinite and easy to tap, as opposed to finite and increasingly difficult to tap. Politically, the government's own opinion polls show that solar is outstandingly the most popular energy technology with the British public, year after year, miles ahead of fracking, even now, so early in the game. In the most recent poll, for DECC itself, support for fracking was down at just 24%. The opportunity cost is that many leaders in the oil and gas industry, and their supporters in government, want actively to suppress this fast-growing global industry, with its fast-falling cost base \u2013 along with all the other clean-energy industries \u2013 so as to not put investors in gas off. The fact that the oil-and-gas incumbency views solar as such a threat to their business models should tell us everything we need to know. \u2022 Jeremy Leggett is the founding chairman of Solarcentury, the UK's largest solar solutions company, and charity SolarAid. Before that, as an academic and oil industry consultant in the 1980s, he took research funding from Shell, BP, and other companies, for work on such areas as shale energy.

      "bodyText": "Profits at Nationwide building society soared by 141% in the three months from April to June 2014 despite a one-third drop in lending to homebuyers owing in part to a regulatory crackdown on mortgages. The society said its first-quarter profits jumped from \u00a3105m to \u00a3253m, boosted by an increase in current account customers switching from other banks, and higher deposits by members. But the rise comes despite a steep fall in lending volumes. During the quarter, the society lent a total of \u00a35.8bn, down from \u00a36.4bn compared with the same quarter last year. Net lending \u2013 which paints a truer picture as it strips out the effect of people paying off their loans or simply remortgaging \u2013 was down even more, falling from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a31.7bn. Nationwide is the biggest lender to first-time buyers in the UK, accounting for around one in six loans in the sector. The figures will add to the debate over the impact of the Financial Conduct Authority's Mortgage Market Review, which came into force during the period. It compels lenders to make more stringent affordability checks before granting loans, and is widely credited with forcing a slowdown in lending. But industry insiders believe volumes will recover once lenders become more familiar with handling the new checks. Nationwide said that although the review had some impact, its mortgage volumes reflected an exceptional quarter last year, when few other lenders were in the market. The society is powering ahead in the current account market, opening 110,000 new accounts during the period, taking its market share from 6.2% to 6.4%. Some of the customers joining Nationwide were former Co-operative Bank customers seeking a mutual alternative to the troubled bank, although Nationwide said it had success with former customers from every bank, obtaining a 10% share of the \"switching\"market. Deposits by members rose by \u00a31.5bn to \u00a3132bn, helping the society to increase its core capital strength measures. Its key ratio, CET1, rose to 16.3% from 14.5%, which is substantially above the minimum required. The improvement comes partly from the society's continuing reduction in commercial loan balances, and no extra provisions for compensation such as payment protection insurance(PPI). Graham Beale, Nationwide's chief executive, said: \"Nationwide has continued to help members to save, buy their own homes and manage their money in a way that suits their needs. As a result, member deposits increased by \u00a31.5bn, we grew our share of current accounts to 6.4% and we supported the housing market, helping over 23,000 people to buy their home, with gross mortgage lending of \u00a35.8bn. \"In line with our focus on customer service we have sustained our position as number one for customer service satisfaction, where our lead over our high street peer group has increased over this period.\"",

The move follows a Sunday Times report that new chief executive Dave Lewis may have to cut the group's \u00a31.2bn dividend, according to investor David Herro of Harris Associates, which owns around 3% of Tesco. The City is uncertain which way Lewis will go. Analyst Nick Bubb said:</p> <blockquote> Although a cut is looking increasingly likely, we suspect that Tesco's interim dividend will be held at 4.63p.

There is much talk of the need to \"re-base\" margins, but poor trading and structural changes in the market are doing a pretty good job of doing that anyway and, if the prospect is of Tesco's earnings dropping to, say, only around 20p a share for the foreseeable future, then it would be prudent to cut the full-year dividend to only 8p or 9p a share. </blockquote> <p>Clive Black at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> Dividend rebasing is a live topic of debate at this time with the market seeking to anticipate the potential moves of Tesco's designate chief executive Dave Lewis.

In article published in The Sunday Telegraph (17 August 2014), it is reported that 230 Morrison's will now open from 6am to 11pm as management states that the company 'need to be open for longer' to meet the demands of 'modern family life, flexible working hours and busy schedules'. <br> We see this move by Morrison's as an interesting one noting that with longer openings, the paper speaks of 1600 extra trading hours per week, are likely to be included in the group's measure of third quarter like-for-like sales, noting as we do that the group is expected to report first half trading up to the end of July in its interim results that are set to be issued on the 11 September 2014.

If Hockey can\u2019t even sell that in a way that shows his understanding of the issue, then he has no hope when it comes to changes to the GST. When we look at broad categories of spending we see that in each one poorer households spend more of their income than do the richest: Thus, across the board, a GST will undoubtedly be regressive. There is nothing inherently wrong with a regressive tax, but it behoves the government to justify making poor people pay more of their income than the rich \u2013 just as the government also needs to justify why for its paid parental leave scheme it is giving more money to the rich than the poor. For example the poorest households spend 2.2% of their income on tobacco compared with 0.4% by the richest.

In this case a GST levy on such fees, raising $3.3bn in taxation revenue, would actually be a progressive tax and is certainly one worth considering. Raising the GST on food however would be much more problematical. When looking at all food expenditure, we see the biggest disparity between rich and poor is the amount spent on food that is currently GST exempt. The poorest spend 16.7% of their weekly income on such food, compared with just 4.4% by the richest households. The Treasury suggested levying a GST on food could bring in an extra $6.1bn a year in revenue, but there would have to be a massive increase in benefits to the poorest to compensate. The pattern of health expenditure shows the real impact of the older age of those in the lowest quintile. The poorest households spend far and away more of their income on medical expenses than any other. But the big difference is not GP visits or even health insurance, but the amount spent on specialist doctors\u2019 visits. Excluding the lowest quintile (and its high proportion of seniors) sees a much more even spread of expenditure, and thus levying GST on health might not be as regressive as this chart first suggests. And given increasing the GST on anything would require a large increase to the pension, the increase in costs might be quite easily compensated.

It is tough because by and large it requires dealing with the regressive nature which can see the poorest hit much harder than the wealthiest. It requires a treasurer to be not only able to sell policy, but also to be completely across the implications of who will be affected by the tax. The treasurer must know that the impact of taxation is more complex than just working out who pays the most in absolute dollar terms.
