      "bodyText": "Barclays shareholders are considering demanding a meeting with Sir Michael Rake, the senior independent director on the board, amid mounting concern about tension within the bank's boardroom. Following reports that Alison Carnwath, the Barclays director who heads the remuneration committee, had not initially supported the payment of a \u00a32.7m bonus to the chief executive, Bob Diamond, shareholders are understood to want to hear from the senior independent director rather than the bank's chairman, Marcus Agius. Carnwath, a serial non-executive director who also chairs Land Securities, faced a protest vote of 20% at the Barclays annual meeting. More than 30% of investors failed to back the bank's pay policies after Diamond was awarded the controversial bonus and the bank paid \u00a35.7m of his taxes. Diamond received \u00a317m in total. Shareholders did not want to be identified but they now believe that Carnwath did not support the bonus payout \u2013 initially at least. When this speculation first surfaced, Agius said that the bank encouraged \"a full and vigorous debate\" but insisted that the pay deals were supported unanimously. The Barclays annual meeting took place at the start of what has been dubbed the \"shareholder spring\", when there was a wave of protests about executive pay. Chris Grigg, the chief executive of British Land, the FTSE 100 property development firm behind the Lakeside shopping centre, is the latest to emerge as having a bumper pay rise last year. Grigg received a 50% boost to his pay packet this year to \u00a33.4m, while his staff saw wages drop by an average of more than 5%. Grigg received \u00a31.9m in salary, bonus and benefits, plus a \u00a3280,000 cash allowance in lieu of a pension contribution in the year to March 2012. A golden hello of shares awarded \"in order to facilitate [his] recruitment\" in 2009 were also handed over, worth \u00a31.19m. British Land's chief executive, a former investment banker, cashed in more than half of those shares, pocketing \u00a3622,000. In the previous year, he received \u00a32m in salary, bonus and benefits, plus another \u00a3280,000 in lieu of a pension payment. By contrast, employees were paid an average salary of \u00a3127,000 this year, compared with \u00a3134,000 last year. The company's headcount increased slightly from 179 in the head office to 205 this year. The details were published in British Land's annual report. The value of British Land's portfolio of office and retail property \u2013 which ranges from Cabot Circus in Bristol to Broadgate Circus in the City and Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield \u2013 rose by 2.6% to \u00a310.3bn in the year to March. The company, which is also developing the \"Cheesegrater\" skyscraper in the City, said London's booming office rental market helped drive a 5% increase in pre-tax profits in the year to March. Lord Turnbull, chairman of British Land's remuneration committee, defended the pay scheme. \"Pay plays an important retention role and hence needs to be competitive with alternative employment opportunities,\" he wrote in the annual report. \"This is particularly so as British Land's expectations of staff are high and there is a scarcity value on proven performers.\" As chief executive of a bank that is 82%-owned by the taxpayer, Hester now suffers even more scrutiny of his pay packet and was forced to waive a near \u00a31m bonus this year after a political row.",

The street has them making $2.50.\" Much of the evidence brought against Gupta was circumstantial, and legal experts said they were surprised at the speed of the jury's verdict. John Coffee, Adolf A Berle professor of law at Columbia law school, said: \"Even in the Rajaratnam case where there was more of a 'smoking gun' the jury took 12 days,\" he said. Coffee said Gupta's legal team had mounted an \"impressive\" defence against a case that he said many prosecutors would have been reluctant to bring. The prosecution never accused Gupta of personally trading on inside information but argued he benefited from his stake in Voyager, an investment firm he set up with Rajaratnam which invested in Galleon funds. The defense argued that there was no evidence that Gupta profited, or traded on, any alleged tip and said Gupta had considered suing Rajaratnam over Voyager, which failed. Rajaratnam was caught on dozens of wiretaps discussing inside information and trades he had made, but the evidence against Gupta was far less compelling. The prosecution offered only one substantive conversation between the two men, and Rajaratnam did not trade on the information prosecutors alleged was shared. The jury appears to have been convinced by the pattern of Gupta's behavior. Prosecutors argued that he called Rajaratnam time and again after learning of developments at companies where he served as a director. \"This is an significant win for Preet Bharar. A lot of other attorneys would not have been as gutsy,\" he said. \"It is pretty clear evidence that juries will convict on circumstantial evidence.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will push ahead next week with plans to make bank loans cheaper despite a cool response from business leaders who said the scheme will fail to reach firms struggling to secure loans. Critics of the central bank's scheme, announced by governor Sir Mervyn King in a speech at the Mansion House on Thursday, said the \u00a380bn on offer would also fail to protect the UK's banks against a bank run in the eurozone. In a fresh move to kickstart the economy, the Bank of England will start offering cheap cash loans to high street banks next week. Banks will be able to swap poor quality assets like credit card debt and commercial real estate loans in return for a six-month cash loan under the central bank's first Extended Collateral Term Repo Facility operation. The new funds will be in addition to the \u00a3325bn already spent by the central bank through its programme of quantitative easing (QE) on government bonds held by banks and insurance companies. The decision to activate the facility comes as UK banks have faced significantly higher funding costs than their eurozone counterparts, and analysts said the scheme should help take off some of the pressure. \"This is a more direct approach to reduce the funding costs of banks [than QE] and is a much better way of doing it,\" said Guy Mandy, a strategist at Nomura. \"It's one of the better moves they (the BoE) have made.\" In recent months lenders have come under fire from business and consumer groups for passing on more expensive loan rates to mortgage customers and companies that are struggling to surveive in the recession. Bank share prices jumped on the news that the scheme would begin operating from 20 June. The banks are expected to begin offering cheaper loans almost immediately after the announcement sent their own funding costs tumbling on wholesale markets. However, several business leaders said the scheme would prove to have a limited impact. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \"Facing a bombardment from the eurozone the chancellor and governor are calling up the reserves. Defensive measures need to be put in place and they're making sure everyone knows they've done it. The extended liquidity and funding for lending schemes are welcome, but limited.\" John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said \"too many question marks\" remained over how the schemes would work. \"How, for example, will the funding for the lending scheme be set up and monitored so that it does in fact deliver money to the real economy? \"Additional quantitative easing and the credit easing programme have not had the desired impact on the real economy. Can the chancellor and governor make sure these sequels trump the originals?\" The Treasury believes that making borrowing cheaper will kickstart the economy and has the backing of several policymakers at the Bank of England. King said in his speech that the weak state of the economy may encourage the monetary policy committee, which he chairs, to increase QE alongside the new scheme. The central bank already offers regular cash loans in return for high quality assets, but demand at these operations has been muted as banks have wanted to hang on to their safer collateral. To bolster take-up of its new liquidity tool, the BoE has cut the price of its loans by a full percentage point, and is offering a much longer loan maturity than the 30 days it envisaged when it launched the scheme in December. The Bank will lend the money at a minimum of bank rate, which is currently 0.5%, plus an additional 25 basis points. It said it would hold at least one Extended Collateral Term Repo Facility a month until further notice and would offer at least \u00a35bn at each operation. Jonathan Portes, head of macro-economic think tank NIESR said central bank support can stop a meltdown across the banking system in times of severe stress. However, just making credit cheaper may amount to pushing on a string, Portes said. \"It may not be about the banks but about business confidence,\" he said. \"Most of the problem with business investment is on the demand side.\"",

      "standfirst": "Converting sovereign debt in excess of 60% of GDP into eurobonds risks moral hazard \u2013 this is precisely where countries will have most trouble resisting temptation", 
      "body": "<p>Any solution to the eurozone crisis must meet a short-run objective and a long-run goal. Unfortunately, the two tend to conflict.</p> <p>The short-run objective is to return Greece, Portugal, and other troubled countries to a sustainable debt path (that is, a declining debt/GDP ratio). Austerity has raised debt/GDP ratios, but a debt write-down or bigger bailouts would undermine the long-term goal of minimising the risk of similar debt crises in the future.</p> <p>Long-run fiscal rectitude is the only way to accomplish that goal. But it is hard to commit today to practice fiscal rectitude tomorrow. Official debt caps, such as the Maastricht fiscal criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), failed because they were unenforceable.</p> <p>The introduction of eurobonds \u2013 joint, aggregate eurozone liabilities \u2013 could be part of the solution, if designed properly. There is certainly demand for them in China and other major emerging countries, which are desperate for an alternative to low-yielding US government securities.</p> <p>But Germany remains opposed on moral-hazard grounds: a joint guarantee of eurozone members' liabilities would strengthen individual national governments' incentive to spend beyond their means. Indeed, this version of eurobonds would fail, both economically and politically.</p> <p>But a different version has begun to gain traction in Germany. The German Council of Economic Experts has proposed a European Redemption Fund (ERF). The plan would convert into de facto 25-year eurobonds the existing sovereign debt of member countries in excess of 60% of GDP, the threshold specified by the Maastricht criteria and the SGP. Steps toward this solution to the short-term debt problem would be paired with implementation of the \"fiscal compact,\" German leader Angela Merkel's proposed solution to the long-term problem.</p> <p>But this seems upside down. To use eurobonds as the mechanism for eliminating the big sovereign-debt overhang jeopardises the longer-term objective of eliminating moral hazard: it offers absolution precisely on the 60%-of-GDP margin where countries will have the most trouble resisting temptation. After all, there is little reason to believe that the fiscal compact or proposed \"debt brakes\" will succeed where the Maastricht criteria and the SGP failed. Rules need a credible enforcement mechanism.</p> <p>Misplaced hope that the enforcement problem can be solved by enshrining the fiscal compact in member states' constitutions might be based on a misunderstanding of the US system. To be sure, the US federal government has never bailed out a state, 49 of which (all but Vermont) have laws or constitutional provisions that limit deficit spending. But the main explanation for the absence of US moral hazard is that the right precedent was set in 1841, when the federal government let eight states and the Territory of Florida default. Eurozone leaders should have done the same with Greece a year or two ago.</p> <p>Ever since 1841, the market requires that US states running up questionable levels of debt pay an interest-rate premium to compensate for the default risk. By contrast, Greece and the eurozone's other heavy borrowers were able to borrow at interest rates that had fallen to virtually the same level as German bunds. Had the ECB operated from the outset under a rule prohibiting it from accepting SGP-noncompliant countries' debt as collateral, the entire eurozone sovereign-debt problem might have been avoided.</p> <p>Moreover, even the most fiscally dysfunctional US states, like California, do not operate on a scale remotely near that of European national governments. When citizens began in the twentieth century to demand more from their governments \u2013 defence, entitlement spending etc \u2013 the expansion in the US took place at the federal level, where spending today amounts to 24% of GDP, compared to just 1.2% of GDP for the European Union budget.</p> <p>The version of eurobonds that might work as the missing long-term enforcement mechanism is almost the reverse of the Germans' ERF proposal: the \"blue bonds\" proposed two years ago by Jacques Delpla and Jakob von Weizs\u00e4cker.

      "bodyText": "Any solution to the eurozone crisis must meet a short-run objective and a long-run goal. Unfortunately, the two tend to conflict. The short-run objective is to return Greece, Portugal, and other troubled countries to a sustainable debt path (that is, a declining debt/GDP ratio). Austerity has raised debt/GDP ratios, but a debt write-down or bigger bailouts would undermine the long-term goal of minimising the risk of similar debt crises in the future. Long-run fiscal rectitude is the only way to accomplish that goal. But it is hard to commit today to practice fiscal rectitude tomorrow. Official debt caps, such as the Maastricht fiscal criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), failed because they were unenforceable. The introduction of eurobonds \u2013 joint, aggregate eurozone liabilities \u2013 could be part of the solution, if designed properly. There is certainly demand for them in China and other major emerging countries, which are desperate for an alternative to low-yielding US government securities. But Germany remains opposed on moral-hazard grounds: a joint guarantee of eurozone members' liabilities would strengthen individual national governments' incentive to spend beyond their means. Indeed, this version of eurobonds would fail, both economically and politically. But a different version has begun to gain traction in Germany. The German Council of Economic Experts has proposed a European Redemption Fund (ERF). The plan would convert into de facto 25-year eurobonds the existing sovereign debt of member countries in excess of 60% of GDP, the threshold specified by the Maastricht criteria and the SGP. Steps toward this solution to the short-term debt problem would be paired with implementation of the \"fiscal compact,\" German leader Angela Merkel's proposed solution to the long-term problem. But this seems upside down. To use eurobonds as the mechanism for eliminating the big sovereign-debt overhang jeopardises the longer-term objective of eliminating moral hazard: it offers absolution precisely on the 60%-of-GDP margin where countries will have the most trouble resisting temptation. After all, there is little reason to believe that the fiscal compact or proposed \"debt brakes\" will succeed where the Maastricht criteria and the SGP failed. Rules need a credible enforcement mechanism. Misplaced hope that the enforcement problem can be solved by enshrining the fiscal compact in member states' constitutions might be based on a misunderstanding of the US system. To be sure, the US federal government has never bailed out a state, 49 of which (all but Vermont) have laws or constitutional provisions that limit deficit spending. But the main explanation for the absence of US moral hazard is that the right precedent was set in 1841, when the federal government let eight states and the Territory of Florida default. Eurozone leaders should have done the same with Greece a year or two ago. Ever since 1841, the market requires that US states running up questionable levels of debt pay an interest-rate premium to compensate for the default risk. By contrast, Greece and the eurozone's other heavy borrowers were able to borrow at interest rates that had fallen to virtually the same level as German bunds. Had the ECB operated from the outset under a rule prohibiting it from accepting SGP-noncompliant countries' debt as collateral, the entire eurozone sovereign-debt problem might have been avoided. Moreover, even the most fiscally dysfunctional US states, like California, do not operate on a scale remotely near that of European national governments. When citizens began in the twentieth century to demand more from their governments \u2013 defence, entitlement spending etc \u2013 the expansion in the US took place at the federal level, where spending today amounts to 24% of GDP, compared to just 1.2% of GDP for the European Union budget. The version of eurobonds that might work as the missing long-term enforcement mechanism is almost the reverse of the Germans' ERF proposal: the \"blue bonds\" proposed two years ago by Jacques Delpla and Jakob von Weizs\u00e4cker. Under this plan, only debt issued by national authorities below the 60%-of-GDP threshold could receive eurozone backing and seniority. When a country issued debt above the threshold, the resulting \"red bonds\" would lose this status. The point is that the enforcement mechanism would be truly automatic: market interest rates would provide the discipline that bureaucrats in Brussels cannot. If private investors judged that the new debt had been incurred in temporary circumstances genuinely beyond the government's control (say, a natural disaster), they would not impose a large interest-rate penalty. Otherwise, the risk-premium mechanism would operate on the red bonds, much as it does on US states. Of course, the eurozone cannot establish a blue-bond regime without first solving the problems of debt overhang and troubled banks. Otherwise, the plan itself would be destabilising, because almost all countries would immediately be in the red. Many countries, with debt/GDP ratios already far in excess of 60%, face high borrowing costs and austerity-deepened recessions as well. Sharing their debt burden up to 60% of GDP would be substantial assistance, but it would not necessarily restore debt sustainability. Thus, eurobonds are not a complete solution. In the short term, Greece may well default and leave the euro. Governments and banks in other countries will then have to be insulated from the conflagration through a combination of bailout money and strong policy conditionality. Creating this fire break between Greece and Europe's core would have been far easier two years ago, before debt/GDP ratios and sovereign spreads climbed so high, and before eurozone leaders' credibility sank so low, or even one year ago. It might or might not work today. But one thing seems clear. German taxpayers, whose longstanding suspicion of profligate Mediterranean euro members has been vindicated, will not be happy when asked to pay still more for the cause of European integration. At a minimum, they will need some credible reason to believe that 20 years of false assurances have come to an end \u2013 that this is the last bailout.
