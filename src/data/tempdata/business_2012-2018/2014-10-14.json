      "bodyText": "The prospects of an interest rate rise in the next few months have dimmed after inflation fell to a five-year low last month. Official figures showed inflation dropped to 1.2% in September from 1.5% in August as food and fuel prices fell. The easing pace of price rises will take some pressure off households that have been struggling with below-inflation pay rises for years and will be welcomed by homeowners who had been bracing themselves for higher mortgage costs in the new year. The inflation figure also means the basic state pension will rise by 2.5%, or \u00a32.85 a week, in April, as the government\u2019s \u201ctriple lock\u201d guarantees a rise of whichever is the greater out of average earnings, September\u2019s inflation rate or 2.5%. Financial markets were caught off guard by the fall as City economists had expected a more modest slowdown in consumer price inflation (CPI) to 1.4%. The pound weakened against the euro and the dollar, and yields fell on UK government bonds as traders pushed back bets on when the central bank will start to raise rates from their current record low. The markets are now pricing in the first rise in borrowing costs for mid-2015. Until now the market consensus had been the early months of next year, though some economists had warned growth was softening and price pressures were benign. \u201cWe have long been expecting the Bank of England to first raise interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% in February \u2013 but it is looking ever more likely that the Bank will delay acting until nearer mid-year,\u201d said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. \u201cMuch will clearly depend on just how well UK growth holds up over the coming weeks and months, as well as how much wages move up in the 2015 pay settlements,\u201d he said. The Office for National Statistics said stronger post-holiday falls in air fares this year and price moves in electronic goods had helped pull inflation down to its lowest level since September 2009. Food and fuel prices also fell on the year after a supermarket price war and a sharp fall in crude oil prices. Excluding volatile items such as food and fuel, there was still a let-up in price pressures and core inflation stood at 1.5%, down from 1.9% in August. The retail price index measure of inflation, which includes housing costs and is used to set many pay deals, fell to 2.3% from 2.4% in August. The Bank has a government-set consumer prices index (CPI) target of 2.0%. If inflation misses that by more than one percentage point on either side, the governor, Mark Carney, must write an open letter to the chancellor, George Osborne, explaining the reasons and what the Bank proposes to do about it. Samuel Tombs of the Capital Economics thinktank thinks there is a good chance Carney will have to put pen to paper given inflation looks likely to fall further over coming months owing to falling oil prices and pledges from utility companies to freeze prices this winter. Tombs also pointed to separate official figures that showed prices paid and charged by manufacturers continued to fall in September. \u201cThe absence of any major underlying inflationary pressure should still ensure that interest rates rise at a very gradual pace by past standards,\u201d he said. The Treasury welcomed the fall in inflation as \u201cfurther evidence that the government\u2019s long-term economic plan is working\u201d, and also highlighted the 2.5% rise in the state pension. \u201cThat means around an extra \u00a3150 more in the pockets next year of those that have worked hard all their lives,\u201d said a Treasury spokesman. But some economists noted that the proposed rise in pension payments will leave a disparity between benefits paid to young and old. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, said: \u201cSeptember\u2019s inflation rate usually has important ramifications for public finances, as it is used to uprate benefit payments. However, with government policy limiting growth in most working age benefits to 1% next year, the net gain to the exchequer from a lower inflation reading will be limited. \u201cPensioners are set to enjoy a relative windfall. With inflation and earnings growth so low, the \u2018triple lock\u2019 means that pensions are set to rise much faster than pay or benefits received by younger people.\u201d Labour pointed out that inflation is still higher than average pay growth, meaning wages continue to fall in real terms. Catherine McKinnell, the shadow Treasury minister, said real wages had fallen by \u00a31,600 a year since 2010. \u201cThe squeeze on working people continues despite this fall in the rate of inflation. Total pay is rising at just 0.6%, which is half the rate of CPI inflation announced today,\u201d she said.",

    "webTitle": "Fears of triple-dip eurozone recession as Germany cuts growth forecasts", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Germany has slashed its growth forecasts for this year and 2015, sparking calls for a public spending boost to prevent the eurozone falling into a triple-dip recession. Berlin now expects growth of just 1.2% this year and the same in 2015, it said on Tuesday, down from 1.8% and 2%, in the face of slowing export growth. It came as official Eurostat figures showed that industrial production across the eurozone slumped in August by an alarming 1.8% month-on-month, meaning it was 1.9% lower than a year ago. With reports mounting of slowing industrial output in Germany and declining business confidence, the eurozone\u2019s largest economy is now expected to expand at less than half the pace of the UK and US over the next year. The economy minister, Sigmar Gabriel, blamed geopolitical tensions and global economic problems overseas. He said: \u201cThe German economy is steering through rough foreign waters. Geopolitical crises have also increased uncertainty in Germany and moderate growth is weighing on the German economy.\u201d An October survey showed a big fall in investor sentiment in Germany, mirroring reports through the summer months of stumbling business confidence following the erosion of previously buoyant demand for German goods. Across the eurozone business optimism in the last three months fell from net 35% to just 5%, according to Grant Thornton\u2019s International Business Report, dragged down by a dramatic fall in German optimism, which plummeted from a net 79% to 36% over the period. Germany\u2019s economy has grown consistently in recent years, giving Berlin added authority in debates over EU-imposed constraints on sovereign budgets. The finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has consistently campaigned for Paris and Rome to be locked into strict budget rules. But amid signs that the German economy is also stalling, the anti-austerity movement is gaining confidence. Last week France\u2019s new economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, called for a eurozone-wide \u20ac300bn (\u00a3240bn) spending boost, while the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has stepped up pressure on Brussels to adopt looser spending rules to spur investment and growth. Their campaign has been bolstered by surveys showing Berlin\u2019s woes may be more deep-seated. The growth downgrades came shortly after German investor sentiment hit its lowest level since 2012, according to the ZEW Institute\u2019s survey. ZEW\u2019s chief economist, Clemens Fuest, said the situation in Germany has deteriorated to such an extent that it could suffer a second quarter of contraction and fall into recession. \u201cIt can\u2019t be excluded that the third quarter will turn out to be negative, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a longer recession, mainly because the domestic fundamentals in Germany are solid.\u201d Further gloom was cast by inflation figures that showed several large economies suffering falling prices. Sweden and Spain both saw prices decline and at a faster rate than expected. Prices in Sweden fell by 0.4% while the Spanish consumer price index dropped by 0.2% on the year in September, compared with a 0.5% fall in August, marking the third straight monthly decline. Sch\u00e4uble dismissed fears that the German economy faced long-term decline. He said: \u201cYou can see from the forecasts that the German government expects the weakness to be temporary and that next year already, according to the available figures, it will slowly pick up. \u201cA growth rate of 1.2%, 1.3% is not particularly wonderful and the lowering of the forecasts compared to what we had announced is not pleasing but it\u2019s no reason to start talking about a crisis.\u201d Berlin aims to achieve a balanced budget with no new debt in 2015. Gabriel said Berlin will not heed calls to abandon its much-criticised doctrine of austerity. \u201cThere is no reason to abandon or change our economic or fiscal policy. Increasing debt in Germany will not generate additional growth in Italy, Spain, France and Greece,\u201d he said. But many economists were unable to share Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s optimism. Ben Brettell, a senior economist at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe most severe problems in the eurozone have so far been limited to the periphery, with the core remaining in relative good health. However, in recent months we have seen a shift. Some peripheral economies are now registering decent growth, while the core looks in trouble.\u201d Together, Germany, France and Italy are responsible for 66% of eurozone GDP. They all contracted in the second quarter and all look like they will contract again in the third. Brettell said: \u201cGiven the relative size of these three economies it is perfectly possible they will drag the whole bloc into recession.\u201d",

The site, which is being developed by Great Portland Estates into offices, shops and 162 apartments, has been valued at \u00a3550m on completion.",

Tesco declined to name the employees but they are understood to be category directors in charge of procuring whole sections of goods for Tesco stores. Sky News is reporting them to be Dan Jago, Tesco\u2019s UK and group wine director, Sean McCurley, director of convenience foods, and William Linnane, director of impulse purchases. Their Twitter and LinkedIn accounts were deactivated on Tuesday. Tesco has said it would update the market and authorities on its investigation at its interim results on 23 October. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is conducting an investigation into the issue. Dave Lewis, Tesco\u2019s new boss, has already asked five senior executives to step aside and Tuesday\u2019s suspensions take the total to eight. Those already suspended are Chris Bush, managing director UK; Carl Rogberg, UK finance director; John Scouler, food commercial director; Matt Simister, who is responsible for sourcing; and Kevin Grace, commercial director. Earlier this week Tesco\u2019s company secretary, Jonathan Lloyd, said he would leave the retailer next March after serving his notice period. Audit committee chairman and non-executive director Ken Hanna is also expected to stand down when his six-year term ends later this year. Tesco beefed up its board last week with the appointment of a former Ikea chief, Mikael Ohlsson, and the Compass CEO, Richard Cousins, as non-executive directors. The accounting scandal, which is being investigated by Deloitte and the law firm Freshfields, has knocked more than a fifth off Tesco\u2019s share price since it was first reported on 22 September, when the company admitted it had overstated its first-half profits forecast by \u00a3250m. The statement came three weeks after a trading update that predicted first-half profit would be \u00a31.1bn, down from \u00a31.6bn a year earlier. This article was amended on Wednesday 15 October 2014. In the original we said four \u2013 rather than five \u2013 senior executives have already been suspended. This has been corrected.",

      "body": "<h2>Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at financial data provider Markit</h2> <p>UK inflation slumped to a five-year low in September. In fact, with the exception of September 2009, at the height of the financial crisis, the rate was the lowest seen for a decade.</p> <p>Data from the Office for National Statistics showed consumer prices rising at an annual rate of 1.2% in September, down from 1.5% in August and lower than expectations of a drop to just 1.4%.</p> <p>With oil and petrol prices falling, import costs dropping due to the exchange rate, supermarkets engulfed in price wars and wage growth at a record low, it\u2019s hard to see why inflation should do anything other than fall further in coming months.</p> <p>This more benign inflation outlook should certainly take pressure off the Bank of England to raise rates, and could even add to calls for policymakers to do more to shore up the recovery amid signs that growth could fade in coming months.</p> <p>While a few months ago, the likelihood was growing that the Bank might need to hike interest rates in late 2014 or early next year, the data are now stacking up to suggest a hike could be delayed at least until next summer, after the general election.</p> <h2>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</h2> <p>These figures confirm that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted and have eased in recent months. With oil and food prices now falling, there is a possibility that consumer price index (CPI) inflation will fall below 1% before the end of this year.</p> <p>This fall in inflation, coupled with weak wage growth, reinforces our call for the MPC [monetary policy committee] to keep interest rates at their current level for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Recent surveys, including our quarterly economic survey, show that the recovery is on track, but is still fragile and faces challenges. Given global economic uncertainties this is clearly not the time to put the recovery at risk with premature interest rate increases. The MPC\u2019s main priority must be to underpin business confidence by giving businesses the stability to plan and invest without any unwelcome surprises.</p> <h2>Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank</h2> <p>We look for a February rate hike, but the risks of a delay are rising with weak inflation and the softer patch the UK economy now appears to be entering.</p> <p>That being said, core inflation is not all that far from the Bank of England\u2019s target. The Bank should look through the impact of volatile food and energy prices on headline inflation. Movements in world prices are outside UK rate-setters\u2019 control, while monetary policy takes about two years to work through the system, by which time any oil or food price changes today will have dropped out of the inflation figures.</p> <p>Low inflation gives the Bank room to wait before hiking rates but we expect eurozone sentiment to turn up by the end of the year, UK unemployment to keep falling rapidly and the tightening labour market to show up in gradually improving wage growth over the next 12 months, making the case for a rate hike early next year.</p> <h2>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight</h2> <p>Underlying price pressures should be limited for some time to come. While GDP growth is seen holding up well at around 0.6-0.7% quarter-on-quarter over the coming quarters, this should not lead to any marked pickup in underlying inflationary pressures in the near term, given the still significant amount of slack in the economy after extended weak activity.</p> <p>Earnings growth will likely strengthen only gradually over the coming months, owing to still-appreciable labour market slack. The pricing power of retailers, manufacturers, and services companies will likely remain limited for some time to come, given the spare capacity in the economy and the prolonged squeeze on consumers\u2019 purchasing power, although some companies may seek to capitalise on now extended improved economic activity by raising prices to strengthen their margins. In fact, a further dip in producer prices in August suggests that manufacturers are currently pricing competitively.</p> <h2>Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency exchange company World First </h2> <p>Inflation expectations are collapsing across developed economies as we close out 2014.</p> <p>Oil and food are the major laggards but winter apparel sales missing expectations and continuing price cuts to summer lines is bringing clothing retailing into the picture as well.</p> <p>Food prices are in deflationary territory by 1.4% on the year \u2013 the sharpest drop since 2002 \u2013 as supermarkets aim to increase their market share through price wars, while the oil price has slumped 24% since June of this year. This has helped consumers, of course, but does little for corporate profitability or for rate expectations.</p> <p>This is only half of the real wage argument and people will still be seeing real-term pay cuts, even at this five-year low in price rises. It also lessens the pressure on the Bank of England to increase interest rates soon.</p> <p>I think this is the final nail in the coffin for expectations of a November rate hike, although those had dwindled of late, and puts pressure on our estimates of a February increase in borrowing costs.</p> <p>Sterling is down 0.65% on the day against the US dollar and 0.7% against the euro.</p>",

David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce These figures confirm that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted and have eased in recent months. With oil and food prices now falling, there is a possibility that consumer price index (CPI) inflation will fall below 1% before the end of this year. This fall in inflation, coupled with weak wage growth, reinforces our call for the MPC [monetary policy committee] to keep interest rates at their current level for the foreseeable future. Recent surveys, including our quarterly economic survey, show that the recovery is on track, but is still fragile and faces challenges. Given global economic uncertainties this is clearly not the time to put the recovery at risk with premature interest rate increases. The MPC\u2019s main priority must be to underpin business confidence by giving businesses the stability to plan and invest without any unwelcome surprises. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg bank We look for a February rate hike, but the risks of a delay are rising with weak inflation and the softer patch the UK economy now appears to be entering. That being said, core inflation is not all that far from the Bank of England\u2019s target. The Bank should look through the impact of volatile food and energy prices on headline inflation. Movements in world prices are outside UK rate-setters\u2019 control, while monetary policy takes about two years to work through the system, by which time any oil or food price changes today will have dropped out of the inflation figures. Low inflation gives the Bank room to wait before hiking rates but we expect eurozone sentiment to turn up by the end of the year, UK unemployment to keep falling rapidly and the tightening labour market to show up in gradually improving wage growth over the next 12 months, making the case for a rate hike early next year. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight Underlying price pressures should be limited for some time to come. While GDP growth is seen holding up well at around 0.6-0.7% quarter-on-quarter over the coming quarters, this should not lead to any marked pickup in underlying inflationary pressures in the near term, given the still significant amount of slack in the economy after extended weak activity. Earnings growth will likely strengthen only gradually over the coming months, owing to still-appreciable labour market slack. The pricing power of retailers, manufacturers, and services companies will likely remain limited for some time to come, given the spare capacity in the economy and the prolonged squeeze on consumers\u2019 purchasing power, although some companies may seek to capitalise on now extended improved economic activity by raising prices to strengthen their margins. In fact, a further dip in producer prices in August suggests that manufacturers are currently pricing competitively. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency exchange company World First Inflation expectations are collapsing across developed economies as we close out 2014. Oil and food are the major laggards but winter apparel sales missing expectations and continuing price cuts to summer lines is bringing clothing retailing into the picture as well. Food prices are in deflationary territory by 1.4% on the year \u2013 the sharpest drop since 2002 \u2013 as supermarkets aim to increase their market share through price wars, while the oil price has slumped 24% since June of this year. This has helped consumers, of course, but does little for corporate profitability or for rate expectations. This is only half of the real wage argument and people will still be seeing real-term pay cuts, even at this five-year low in price rises. It also lessens the pressure on the Bank of England to increase interest rates soon. I think this is the final nail in the coffin for expectations of a November rate hike, although those had dwindled of late, and puts pressure on our estimates of a February increase in borrowing costs. Sterling is down 0.65% on the day against the US dollar and 0.7% against the euro.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The richest 1% of the world\u2019s population are getting wealthier, owning more than 48% of global wealth, according to a report published on Tuesday which warned growing inequality could be a trigger for recession. According to the Credit Suisse global wealth report (pdf), a person needs just $3,650 \u2013 including the value of equity in their home \u2013 to be among the wealthiest half of world citizens. However, more than $77,000 is required to be a member of the top 10% of global wealth holders, and $798,000 to belong to the top 1%. \u201cTaken together, the bottom half of the global population own less than 1% of total wealth. In sharp contrast, the richest decile hold 87% of the world\u2019s wealth, and the top percentile alone account for 48.2% of global assets,\u201d said the annual report, now in its fifth year. The report, which calculates that total global wealth has grown to a new record \u2013 $263tn, more than twice the $117tn calculated for 2000 \u2013 found that the UK was the only country in the G7 to have recorded rising inequality in the 21st century. Its findings were seized upon by anti-poverty campaigners Oxfam which published research at the start of the year showing that the richest 85 people across the globe share a combined wealth of \u00a31tn, as much as the poorest 3.5 billion of the world\u2019s population. \u201cThese figures give more evidence that inequality is extreme and growing, and that economic recovery following the financial crisis has been skewed in favour of the wealthiest. In poor countries, rising inequality means the difference between children getting the chance to go to school and sick people getting life saving medicines,\u201d said Oxfam\u2019s head of inequality Emma Seery. \u201cIn the UK, successive governments have failed to get to grips with rising inequality. This report shows that those least able to afford it have paid the price of the financial crisis whilst more wealth has flooded into the coffers of the very richest.\u201d The $20.1tn rise in global wealth over the past year is the largest recorded since 2007. The total has risen every year since 2008 and is now 20% above its pre-crisis peak, the report said. Wealth in the US in the past year had grown by as much as the $12.3tn the country lost in the financial crisis. The Credit Suisse analysts pointed to the debate that has been sparked by work such as that by Thomas Piketty into long-term trends towards inequality. It pointed out that while inequality had increased in many countries outside the G7, within the group of most developed economies it was only in the UK that inequality had risen since the turn of the century. \u201cOnly one of them, the UK, recorded rising inequality over the entire period 2000\u20132014 and only three show an increase after 2007 \u2013 France, Italy and the UK,\u201d the report says. Of the UK, it says: \u201cNowadays the pattern of wealth distribution in the UK is very typical for a developed economy. Almost 60% of the population has wealth exceeding $100,000 and there are two million US dollar millionaires\u201d. Other calculations by the Credit Suisse team \u201chint at raising global wealth inequality in recent years\u201d and show that overall wealth in the US has grown at a faster pace than incomes. The authors warned it was a trend that could point to recession. \u201cFor more than a century, the wealth income ratio has typically fallen in a narrow interval between 4 and 5. However, the ratio briefly rose above 6 in 1999 during the dotcom bubble and broke that barrier again during 2005\u20132007. It dropped sharply into the \u201cnormal band\u201d following the financial crisis, but the decline has since been reversed, and the ratio is now at a recent record high level of 6.5, matched previously only during the great Depression. This is a worrying signal given that abnormally high wealth income ratios have always signaled recession in the past,\u201d the report said. China now has more people in the top 10% of global wealth holders than any other country except for the US and Japan, having moved into third place in the rankings by overtaking France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.",

      "body": "<p>The richest 1% of the world\u2019s population are getting wealthier, owning more than 48% of global wealth, according to a report published on Tuesday which warned growing inequality could be a trigger for recession.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=60931FDE-A2D2-F568-B041B58C5EA591A4\">Credit Suisse global wealth report</a> (pdf), a person needs just $3,650 \u2013 including the value of equity in their home \u2013 to be among the wealthiest half of world citizens. However, more than $77,000 is required to be a member of the top 10% of global wealth holders, and $798,000 to belong to the top 1%.</p> <p>\u201cTaken together, the bottom half of the global population own less than 1% of total wealth. In sharp contrast, the richest decile hold 87% of the world\u2019s wealth, and the top percentile alone account for 48.2% of global assets,\u201d said the annual report, now in its fifth year.</p> <p>The report, which calculates that total global wealth has grown to a new record \u2013 $263tn, more than twice the $117tn calculated for 2000 \u2013 found that the UK was the only country in the G7 to have recorded rising inequality in the 21st century.</p> <p>Its findings were seized upon by anti-poverty campaigners Oxfam which<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/20/oxfam-85-richest-people-half-of-the-world\"> published research at the start of the year showing that the richest 85 people across the globe share a combined wealth of \u00a31tn</a>, as much as the poorest 3.5 billion of the world\u2019s population.</p> <p>\u201cThese figures give more evidence that inequality is extreme and growing, and that economic recovery following the financial crisis has been skewed in favour of the wealthiest. In poor countries, rising inequality means the difference between children getting the chance to go to school and sick people getting life saving medicines,\u201d said Oxfam\u2019s head of inequality Emma Seery.</p> <p>\u201cIn the UK, successive governments have failed to get to grips with rising inequality. This report shows that those least able to afford it have paid the price of the financial crisis whilst more wealth has flooded into the coffers of the very richest.\u201d</p> <p>The $20.1tn rise in global wealth over the past year is the largest recorded since 2007. The total has risen every year since 2008 and is now 20% above its pre-crisis peak, the report said.</p> <p>Wealth in the US in the past year had grown by as much as the $12.3tn the country lost in the financial crisis.</p> <p>The Credit Suisse analysts pointed to the debate that has been sparked by work such as that by Thomas Piketty into long-term trends towards inequality. It pointed out that while inequality had increased in many countries outside the G7, within the group of most developed economies it was only in the UK that inequality had risen since the turn of the century.</p> <p>\u201cOnly one of them, the UK, recorded rising inequality over the entire period 2000\u20132014 and only three show an increase after 2007 \u2013 France, Italy and the UK,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>Of the UK, it says: \u201cNowadays the pattern of wealth distribution in the UK is very typical for a developed economy. Almost 60% of the population has wealth exceeding $100,000 and there are two million US dollar millionaires\u201d.</p> <p>Other calculations by the Credit Suisse team \u201chint at raising global wealth inequality in recent years\u201d and show that overall wealth in the US has grown at a faster pace than incomes. The authors warned it was a trend that could point to recession.</p> <p>\u201cFor more than a century, the wealth income ratio has typically fallen in a narrow interval between 4 and 5. However, the ratio briefly rose above 6 in 1999 during the dotcom bubble and broke that barrier again during 2005\u20132007. It dropped sharply into the \u201cnormal band\u201d following the financial crisis, but the decline has since been reversed, and the ratio is now at a recent record high level of 6.5, matched previously only during the great Depression. This is a worrying signal given that abnormally high wealth income ratios have always signaled recession in the past,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>China now has more people in the top 10% of global wealth holders than any other country except for the US and Japan, having moved into third place in the rankings by overtaking France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.</p>",
