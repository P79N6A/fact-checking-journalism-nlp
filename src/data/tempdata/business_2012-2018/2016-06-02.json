      "bodyText": "Tata Steel is close to a deal with the government to keep its UK business rather than sell it off, which would secure the future of 11,000 workers and the Port Talbot steelworks. Tata is in talks about a loan worth up to \u00a31bn and a restructuring of the British Steel pension scheme which could shave billions of pounds off its liabilities. The Indian company has been exploring the possibility of keeping the business for weeks and held talks on the matter with business secretary Sajid Javid, in Mumbai last week. Although Tata Steel is continuing to run a sales process for the UK business, it was encouraged to work on keeping its operations by the package of support the government put together for potential buyers. A source close to Tata said: \u201cThey have never stopped negotiating about staying. If everything works out they will stay.\u201d A deal could be announced by the end of June. Any loan between Tata and the government would be on commercial terms, but it could be a key in helping turn around the loss-making business. The Tata source said: \u201cIf it works then they [Tata] will make a profit; it doesn\u2019t then they won\u2019t be able to pay it back.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills declined to comment on talks, saying it was a commercial sales process. But the department reiterated that any government support for a buyer would be on commercial terms in order to comply with European state aid rules. The deadline for buyers to make a formal proposal to buy Tata Steel UK was last week. Eight bidders are thought to be in the running, including metals group Liberty House, Excalibur, a management buyout backed by a Welsh consortium, Leeds-based private equity firm Endless, JSW Steel of India and US group Nucor. However, the potential buyers are thought to be refusing to provide guarantees about how long they will keep the Port Talbot steelworks open, and want cash from Tata. Javid has said the government is willing to offer hundreds of millions of pounds to a buyer of Tata Steel UK and restructure the pension scheme, which has liabilities of almost \u00a315bn and costs more than \u00a3100m a year to support. However, it is not clear whether Tata will take up the government\u2019s offer of taking a 25% stake in the business. The plans to overhaul the pension scheme behind Tata Steel have been supported by the trustees despite warnings that the move would set a dangerous precedent. The pension scheme is regarded as a hurdle to a rescue deal. The latest figures show the deficit has ballooned to \u00a3700m, up from \u00a3485m last year. The government has estimated it would cost \u00a37.5bn to buy out the scheme\u2019s benefits. Under the government\u2019s plan, drawn up with trustees, the scheme would be spun off into a new financial vehicle and benchmarked against the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the retail price index (RPI), potentially saving billions of pounds in future liabilities. A consultation period has started and will end on 23 June. When asked at a press conference last week about keeping Tata Steel UK, Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata, did not rule it out and said the management team was still \u201clooking at continuing and sustaining the business\u201d. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a case as yet.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Airline industry profits expected to increase by 12% in 2016", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The airline industry is expected to have its most lucrative year in history with global profits of almost $40bn (\u00a330bn), driven by a combination of cheaper oil and fuller planes. The International Air Transport Association (Iata), the trade body for airlines, said its forecast for a fifth consecutive year of improving profits meant it was now a \u201cnormal business\u201d, providing decent returns to investors after years of being propped up by wealthy backers and governments. The forecast would mean a 12% rise in profits from last year to $39.4bn (\u00a327.3bn), with more than half of the total ($22.9bn) made in north America. European airlines\u2019 profits are expected to stay almost static at $7.5bn, with demand dampened by terror attacks. Speaking at Iata\u2019s annual meeting in Dublin on Thursday, the Iata director general, Tony Tyler, said lower oil prices were helping, although tempered by hedging and exchange rates, and he warned: \u201cWe are probably nearing the peak of the positive stimulus from lower prices.\u201d But he said performance was being bolstered by \u201cthe hard work of airlines\u201d.. \u201cLoad factors are at record levels. New value streams are increasing ancillary revenues. And joint ventures and other forms of cooperation are improving efficiency and increasing consumer choice while fostering robust competition,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cConsumers are getting a great deal and investors are finally beginning to see the rewards they deserve.\u201d He sounded a note of caution about the profits: \u201cIt sounds a big number but it\u2019s shared around hundreds of airlines and the industry has struggled with profitability. It means airlines should be taken seriously as business, but there are still challenges.\u201d Tyler said many airlines would still need years of profits to pay down debt and fix balance sheets, but things were now looking up after years of precarious finances, exacerbated by the 2008 financial crash. \u201cSimply put, we are beginning to be a normal business.\u201d Iata said global airfares were due to fall by 7% this year, mirroring the fall predicted in Europe\u2019s short-haul, low-cost sector by Ryanair last week. Tyler said: \u201cConsumers are getting a great deal and investors are finally beginning to see the rewards they deserve.\u201d However, some in the industry have voiced concern about the sustainability of the current boom, with demand pinned to lower average fares, or yields, made possible by cheap oil. According to analysis from Iata, the industry\u2019s growth comes in the face of sluggish global trade, which it normally mirrors. Brian Pearce, the chief economist for Iata, said recent indicators were worrying. \u201cAir travel appears to be defying economic gravity,\u201d he said. Bernard Gustin, the chief executive officer of Brussels Airlines, said: \u201cDemand is strong and the profit margins are there, but we know when the [cost of] fuel goes back up we won\u2019t be able to put [ticket prices back up], so we have to prepare for that.\u201d Jayne Hrdlicka, the chief executive of the Jetstar group of Australian and Asian low-cost airlines, admitted that the growing number of services could look irrational if the trend continued. She said: \u201cCapacity is growing ahead of underlying demand which is driving down yields \u2026 [but] costs are well managed. The industry went through a very difficult period when every discretionary dollar was being taken out of airlines, so we were as fit as we\u2019d ever been and we got the benefit of the falling oil price.\u201d Although high fuel bills hobbled the industry for years, with Brent crude costing more than double the current $50 a barrel between 2011 and 2014, airlines at the premium end of the market said the lower oil price had also lost them custom. Sir Tim Clark, chief executive of Emirates, said: \u201cWith oil prices going down, we all said \u2018hallelujah\u2019, but what we didn\u2019t foresee is that the corporate segments that drive the upper echelons of the yield, such as [business flyers] in the oil and gas sector, also [travel less].\u201d Andr\u00e9s Conesa, the chief executive of Aeromexico and chairman of Iata, said high profits were needed for a sustainable business and airports were still making higher margins than airlines. Iata executives have in previous years called for airports to lower costs and charges, but unions for airport workers called on airlines to end the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d, publishing research showing that wages had declined while workload was increasing at many airports. A report by Airports United found that airlines\u2019 labour costs, such as ground handling, fell 5.5% last year, while profits boomed. It warned: \u201cDespite their strong financial performance, airlines have created a race to the bottom that is placing airport workers \u2013 and airport safety and service quality \u2013 under immense pressure.\u201d The group said 80% of aviation revenue was controlled by airlines, which have demanded cheaper deals from airports. Airport workers from the US, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden spoke outside the airlines\u2019 summit in Dublin to highlight working conditions. Josefine Dalby, 34, a security officer at Stockholm airport, said many of her colleagues had experienced ill health and stress, with more passengers to process and fewer staff. \u201cWe have a big responsibility but the wheels are turning faster and we are getting worn out.\u201d Iata\u2019s Pearce said: \u201cLabour costs are probably the biggest cost for many airlines after fuel.\u201d He said productivity deals had helped ensure that \u201cunit labour costs don\u2019t get out of control.\u201d",

European airlines\u2019 profits are expected to stay almost static at $7.5bn, with demand dampened by terror attacks.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"13dc16c80987bb03106f377656e13738523144ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13dc16c80987bb03106f377656e13738523144ef/0_0_2330_3500/666.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Tyler speaking at the Iata annual general meeting in Dublin.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Tyler speaking at the Iata annual general meeting in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking at Iata\u2019s annual meeting in Dublin on Thursday, the Iata director general, Tony Tyler, said lower oil prices were helping, although tempered by hedging and exchange rates, and he warned: \u201cWe are probably nearing the peak of the positive stimulus from lower prices.\u201d </p> <p>But he said performance was being bolstered by \u201cthe hard work of airlines\u201d.. </p> <p>\u201cLoad factors are at record levels. New value streams are increasing ancillary revenues. And joint ventures and other forms of cooperation are improving efficiency and increasing consumer choice while fostering robust competition,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cConsumers are getting a great deal and investors are finally beginning to see the rewards they deserve.\u201d</p> <p>He sounded a note of caution about the profits: \u201cIt sounds a big number but it\u2019s shared around hundreds of airlines and the industry has struggled with profitability. It means airlines should be taken seriously as business, but there are still challenges.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler said many airlines would still need years of profits to pay down debt and fix balance sheets, but things were now looking up after years of precarious finances, exacerbated by the 2008 financial crash. \u201cSimply put, we are beginning to be a normal business.\u201d</p> <p>Iata said global airfares were due to fall by 7% this year, mirroring the fall <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/23/ryanair-to-cut-fares-by-as-much-as-12-percent-price-war\">predicted in Europe\u2019s short-haul, low-cost sector by Ryanair last week</a>. Tyler said: \u201cConsumers are getting a great deal and investors are finally beginning to see the rewards they deserve.\u201d</p> <p>However, some in the industry have voiced concern about the sustainability of the current boom, with demand pinned to lower average fares, or yields, made possible by cheap oil.</p> <p>According to analysis from Iata, the industry\u2019s growth comes in the face of sluggish global trade, which it normally mirrors. Brian Pearce, the chief economist for Iata, said recent indicators were worrying. \u201cAir travel appears to be defying economic gravity,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bernard Gustin, the chief executive officer of Brussels Airlines, said: \u201cDemand is strong and the profit margins are there, but we know when the [cost of] fuel goes back up we won\u2019t be able to put [ticket prices back up], so we have to prepare for that.\u201d</p> <p>Jayne Hrdlicka, the chief executive of the Jetstar group of Australian and Asian low-cost airlines, admitted that the growing number of services could look irrational if the trend continued. </p> <p>She said: \u201cCapacity is growing ahead of underlying demand which is driving down yields \u2026 [but] costs are well managed. The industry went through a very difficult period when every discretionary dollar was being taken out of airlines, so we were as fit as we\u2019d ever been and we got the benefit of the falling oil price.\u201d</p> <p>Although high fuel bills hobbled the industry for years, with Brent crude costing more than double the current $50 a barrel between 2011 and 2014, airlines at the premium end of the market said the lower oil price had also lost them custom. </p> <p>Sir Tim Clark, chief executive of Emirates, said: \u201cWith oil prices going down, we all said \u2018hallelujah\u2019, but what we didn\u2019t foresee is that the corporate segments that drive the upper echelons of the yield, such as [business flyers] in the oil and gas sector, also [travel less].\u201d</p> <p>Andr\u00e9s Conesa, the chief executive of Aeromexico and chairman of Iata, said high profits were needed for a sustainable business and airports were still making higher margins than airlines.</p> <p>Iata executives have in previous years called for airports to lower costs and charges, but unions for airport workers called on airlines to end the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d, publishing research showing that wages had declined while workload was increasing at many airports.</p> <p>A report by Airports United found that airlines\u2019 labour costs, such as ground handling, fell 5.5% last year, while profits boomed. It warned: \u201cDespite their strong financial performance, airlines have created a race to the bottom that is placing airport workers \u2013 and airport safety and service quality \u2013 under immense pressure.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5cad26273b744fe4c13bbe0b7871908ec0f72050\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cad26273b744fe4c13bbe0b7871908ec0f72050/0_202_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Airport workers protest outside the International Air Transport Association annual general meeting in Dublin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Airport workers protest outside the Iata annual general meeting in Dublin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The group said 80% of aviation revenue was controlled by airlines, which have demanded cheaper deals from airports.<br></p> <p>Airport workers from the US, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden spoke outside the airlines\u2019 summit in Dublin to highlight working conditions. </p> <p>Josefine Dalby, 34, a security officer at Stockholm airport, said many of her colleagues had experienced ill health and stress, with more passengers to process and fewer staff. \u201cWe have a big responsibility but the wheels are turning faster and we are getting worn out.\u201d</p> <p>Iata\u2019s Pearce said: \u201cLabour costs are probably the biggest cost for many airlines after fuel.\u201d He said productivity deals had helped ensure that \u201cunit labour costs don\u2019t get out of control.\u201d</p> <p><br><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "BHS department stores are to disappear from British high streets after almost 90 years, with 11,000 workers losing their job. In the biggest failure in the retail industry since the demise of Woolworths in 2008, the administrators to BHS will wind down the business and close its 163 shops after a rescue deal fell apart. The liquidation of BHS will crank up the pressure on Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell, the former owners of the retailer, who have left BHS with a \u00a3571m pension deficit. Green and other investors collected more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership of BHS, while Chappell\u2019s consortium Retail Acquisitions was paid millions in salaries and management fees. Anna Soubry, the business minister, said the government will take any misconduct in the demise of BHS \u201cextremely seriously\u201d. Union leaders called the news a devastating blow for staff. Speaking outside BHS\u2019s headquarters in Marylebone, north London, staff expressed their anger at the former owners. One male worker, who declined to give his name, said: \u201cIt\u2019s our previous owners that anger is directed at. They took money out of the business that wasn\u2019t there to be taken. Whatever Mr Sir says, to walk away from a company with a big pension deficit like that is disgusting. It\u2019s not moral.\u201d Another employee said: \u201cSome people have been in this building for 45 years and they are not people who can just walk onto yachts. These are people who have mortgages and shop at Asda.\u201d MPs will quiz Green and Chappell within the next two weeks about their roles in the scandal. Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, said he was very disturbed by the collapse of the retailer. He dismissed the administrators\u2019 analysis that BHS had been a victim of seismic shifts on the high street. \u201cThere was nothing inevitable about its collapse at all. \u00a31.3bn was taken out of this company,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an unbelievable slap in the face for those on the Tory benches who believe in righteous capitalism. It has proved hollow in this case. We have a system of capitalism in this country where huge sums could be taken out of BHS and there was no moral guidance or compass on the owners. They had all the privileges of ownership without the feeling of responsibility of it.\u201d A spokesman for Green said he was \u201csaddened and disappointed by the news\u201d, adding: \u201cHe had hoped the business could be saved as a going concern.\u201d Chappell did not respond to requests for comment. Staff at BHS\u2019s head office in London were being made redundant on Thursday, while the company\u2019s remaining 163 shops will close over the next few weeks as they run out of stock. The BHS brand will disappear unless another business buys the name. Shoppers at BHS\u2019s flagship shop on Oxford Street in London said the brand had struggled to stand out amid fierce competition on the high street. Carol, who only wanted to give her first name, said: \u201cThey didn\u2019t market it properly. In the past it was known for it\u2019s lighting department. It\u2019s just a toxic company. I don\u2019t know why the government let Philip Green sell it for a pound. What company is sold for a pound? You need to question that.\u201d Duff &amp; Phelps, the administrator, said a rescue deal for BHS could not be agreed because of the significant amount of cash needed to rebuild the business, despite \u201cmultiple offers\u201d being received for the chain. The administrators had been locked in talks about a rescue deal for the last two weeks with a Portuguese-backed consortium led by Greg Tufnell, the brother of former England cricketer Phil, and a former managing director of Mothercare and Burton. It is understood the consortium were told they needed to show they had \u00a3100m to rebuild BHS, but could not provide proof of their funds. The collapse of BHS, which was founded in 1928 in Brixton, south London, is likely to lead to the loss of 8,000 staff jobs, as well as a further 3,000 contractors who worked in the stores. These contractors include staff working in BHS cafes for Compass, the catering group, and Arcadia staff working in Dorothy Perkins and Wallis concessions within BHS. The administrator will now look to sell off BHS\u2019s assets, including individual stores and the brand name. It has brought in Hilco, the restructuring firm and owner of HMV, to help wind down BHS. Philip Duffy, managing director of Duff &amp; Phelps, said: \u201cThe British high street is changing and in these turbulent times for retailers, BHS has fallen as another victim of the seismic shifts we are seeing. The tireless work and goodwill of the existing management team and employees of BHS with the support of my team were not enough to change the fortunes of the company.\u201d A spokesman for BHS said its management team were \u201ccrushed\u201d by the news and blamed the company\u2019s demise on Chappell\u2019s failure to deliver up to \u00a3100m of new funding that he had promised. \u201cIt was left in too much of a weakened state,\u201d he said. Green owned the retailer for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a collection of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell, who has been declared bankrupt three times. As well as the investigation by MPs into the circumstances surrounding BHS, the government has fast-tracked an Insolvency Service probe. Soubry said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement that the administrators have been unable to find a buyer for the business will be devastating news for all those who work at BHS and those in the supply chain. The government stands ready to support workers to find new jobs as quickly as possible. \u201cThe business secretary has already announced an accelerated Insolvency Service investigation into the activity of former BHS directors. Any issues of misconduct will be taken extremely seriously.\u201d The Insolvency Service is working closely with the administrators. Sources close to BHS say that last month a court order was issued to Chappell ordering him to hand over his mobile phone and laptop. David Gill, the national officer of Usdaw, the trade union for shopworkers, said there were very serious questions to be answered over the collapse of BHS and called on the government to reconsider Britain\u2019s administration laws. At present the administrator must work to secure the best return for secured creditors, such as banks, rather than staff. He said: \u201cThe staff in BHS have been in a state of anxiety and uncertainty for over a year after the company was sold for one pound, went into administration and has now been put in liquidation. \u201cThis news is a devastating blow for the staff and the shock waves will be felt on high streets throughout the country. There are some very serious questions that need to be answered, by former owners of the business, about how a company with decades of history and experience in retail has now come to this very sorry end.\u201d Arcadia is a secured creditor of BHS and could get about \u00a335m back from the sale of any assets by the administrator. This \u00a335m was originally earmarked for the company\u2019s pension scheme, but it is unclear at present what Green\u2019s plans are for the cash. The pension scheme is entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is funded by a levy on other pension schemes across the UK. This will protect workers pensions, but they are likely to suffer a 10% cut to their benefits. The Pensions Regulator is investigating whether Green should be forced to make contributions to the pension scheme. A spokesperson for the regulator said: \u201cWe recognise that this is a particularly difficult time for BHS employees. Our anti-avoidance investigation continues and our chief executive has given a clear commitment that we will have made significant progress by the end of 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we do not prejudice this complex case and are able to progress it quickly. We are therefore not making any further comment at this time.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The European commission has thrown its weight behind the so-called sharing economy typified by firms such as Uber and Airbnb, saying countries should only ban them as a last resort. The growth of the sharing economy \u2013 defined as businesses that help ordinary people offer services to the public \u2013 has caused tension in several European countries over claims that existing industries are being damaged. Uber, which lets people use their cars to offer taxi rides, and Airbnb, a service through which homeowners can rent out a room or an entire home, have been the subject of bitter protests in European cities. But new guidelines issued by the commission on Thursday warned governments to think carefully before cracking down on such firms, which pulled in \u20ac28bn (\u00a321.6bn) in revenues between them last year across Europe. \u201cAbsolute bans and quantitative restrictions should only be used as a measure of last resort,\u201d the commission said in a statement. Presenting advice aimed at providing clarity to consumers, businesses and public authorities, Jyrki Katainen, a commission vice-president, said stricter regulations on sharing economy companies could cost Europe. Katainen, responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitiveness, said: \u201cWe need a coherent approach if we want our dynamic startups to flourish or they will go somewhere else. Europe\u2019s next unicorn [a startup company valued at $1bn plus] could stem from the collaborative economy.\u201d Speaking in Brussels, Katainen added: \u201cWe want to keep up, and keep Europe as open as the US for new innovative business models, at the same time as addressing the negative effects.\u201d The commission\u2019s paper said companies in the sharing economy should not be subject to sector-specific rules \u2013 such as regulations aimed at hotels and taxi firms \u2013 unless they own assets and set the price of the service. But Katainen also stressed that such businesses should not become a \u201cparallel informal economy\u201d operating free of regulation. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the collaborative economy cannot be a way to abuse labour. Neither is it a way to avoid paying tax.\u201d The commission\u2019s guidelines are intended to address the increasingly fractious relationship between fast-growing businesses and the countries in which they set up shop. Airbnb users are facing extra taxes in Iceland, while Berlin has banned the rental of entire apartments, though the app is still advertising accommodation in the German capital. Berlin is also among several German cities to issue an edict against Uber, which has faced similar roadblocks erected by regional and local governments in Spain and France, where its offices were raided by police. State intervention has often followed protests or lobbying from competitors such as taxi drivers or the hotel industry, who complain that they are being undercut by rivals who do not face the same regulatory burden. In response to suggestions that the digital sharing economy could kill off traditional jobs, Katainen said this was part of the evolution of the economy, adding: \u201cNew jobs have always replaced old jobs.\u201d The EU commissioner El\u017cbieta Bie\u0144kowska, responsible for internal market, industry, entrepreneurship and small and medium enterprises, noted that the sharing economy could offer job opportunities for those seeking flexible conditions. \u201cThis is an opportunity, not a threat,\u201d she said. The commission\u2019s new guidelines state that service providers should only be required to obtain licences \u201cwhere strictly necessary to meet relevant public interest objections\u201d. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the UK\u2019s TUC union, said: \u201cThe EU guidelines are a good starting point because they make clear that sharing economy companies can be recognised as employers by member states. The UK must build on this to ensure every worker in the sharing economy gets a fair deal, full employment rights, the opportunity to join a union, and is not exploited by a distant tax-dodging tech firm.\u201d Web-based platforms do not need licences where they only act as intermediaries between consumers and those offering the actual service, such as a homeowner or driver. Member states should also distinguish between individuals providing services on an occasional basis and providers acting in a professional capacity, by establishing thresholds based on the level of activity, the guidelines recommend. The commission hinted that it could use the guidelines to ensure that national legislation does not violate EU treaties, a veiled threat to governments seeking to impose restrictive measures on the sharing economy. While some countries have sought to discourage the sharing economy, UK micro-entrepreneurs with small online businesses and short-term landlords were handed \u00a31,000 tax-free allowances in the March budget in a move welcomed by Airbnb. New technologies have also sparked legal tussles due to the lack of legal precedent governing the services they offer. The European court of justice has been asked to decide whether Uber is a transport company or digital service after questions from Spanish and Belgian courts.",

      "bodyText": "Economists campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union have accused the Treasury and international institutions of \u201cgroupthink\u201d in a report that says growth would be boosted if all trade barriers were removed after a leave vote in this month\u2019s referendum. The group Economists for Brexit (EfB) said consumers and businesses would benefit from lower prices once EU-imposed tariffs were removed and dismissed predictions that the UK would be plunged into immediate recession if the remain campaign lost on 23 June. \u201cGroupthink, political collusion and bizarre assumptions have combined to see the economic models of the Treasury and international institutions provide dangerously inaccurate results to the public,\u201d the group said. ProfPatrick Minford said all the studies showing that leaving the EU would have detrimental consequences for the economy were based on the \u201csame flawed model\u201d and the \u201csame damaging assumptions\u201d. Minford said that instead of trying to negotiate access to the Euroepan single market, a post-Brexit Britain should opt to remove all barriers to imports. The move, Minford added, would lead to cheaper food, less expensive manufactured goods and stronger growth, but his admission that UK firms would have to pay tariffs on exports to the single market brought criticism from the former chancellor Alistair Darling, who is campaigning for a remain vote. \u201cIn recent weeks, there has been a relentless stream of output from modelling groups on the topic of Brexit \u2013 all of it negative. This has included long-term and short-term reports from not merely the Treasury but also the Centre for Economic Performance at the LSE, PWC, Oxford Economics, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, the OECD and the IMF,\u201d Minford said. \u201cThe common element in the consensus outside Economists for Brexit is that after Brexit, under the World Trade Organisation option, the UK continues to maintain protectionist tariffs and other trade barriers against the rest of the world, including the EU. By contrast, EfB assumes unilateral free trade after leaving the EU. \u201cWhat has emerged from considering all these approaches used by different modelling groups is that they all assume post-Brexit, the pursuit of protectionist policies on imports by the UK. This reduction of the scope of free trade predictably would damage UK output and productivity whatever methodology is used.\u201d Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last month that a vote leave the EU would have \u201cpretty bad to very, very bad\u201d consequences for the UK, but Minford said the IMF and other forecasting bodies would get a completely different response if they put in different assumptions. \u201cThe key difference in EfB is the use of the unilateral free trade assumption under which Brexit is a move towards free trade,\u201d Minford said. Such a move would provide a growth boost of 4% of GDP within five years and help the UK emerge unscathed from the immediate post-referendum period. \u201cIt also enables the UK to be strong in negotiations and take control of its own policy environment, independently of any actions by our EU neighbours. This in turn closes down short-term policy uncertainty, avoiding the ad hoc rises in credit and other financial costs.\u201d Minford took issue with the chancellor, George Osborne, for dubbing those campaigning to leave the EU as economically illiterate. \u201cOsborne is the one who is economically illiterate here,\u201d Minford said. Responding to Minford\u2019s comments, Darling said: \u201cThe leave campaign have today admitted leaving would mean higher prices and devastation for UK industries. \u201cAfter weeks of expert warnings, the truth has now been exposed. Families\u2019 incomes, British businesses and our financial stability would all be hit if Britain leaves the EU\u2019s single market.

Clearly, it would prefer oil to be changing hands at $60 a barrel rather than $30 a barrel, but $30 a barrel is a lot better than $0 a barrel. Both Saudi Arabia and Iran want to be regional top dog in the Middle East. There is no love lost between Tehran and Riyadh. But even though failure at the Opec talks in Vienna was a dead cert, the decision seemed to come as a surprise to oil traders. Having nudged above the $50 a barrel level, there was a selloff when the news came out. Almost certainly, Opec is going to come back to this issue. For a start, the fundamentals of the oil market suggest prices are going lower rather than higher. That\u2019s not just because global demand is relatively weak, it is because US stocks have been building up steadily for the best part of a decade. As Ben Coombes of Llewellyn Consulting notes, commercial stocks in the US have been going up sharply over the past year and stand at their highest level since the early 1980s. Sluggish demand, new sources of supply from shale fields, and the decision by companies to stockpile while prices are low, have all contributed to a structural imbalance in the market. The imbalance has not been fully corrected even though the cost of crude is less than half what it was at its recent peak of $115 a barrel in the summer of 2014. A further slide in the oil price looks highly likely, even though Saudi Arabia has promised not to flood the market with cheap crude. That will put pressure on Opec members, who need an oil price of $100 a barrel \u2013 and in some cases a lot higher than that \u2013 to balance the books. Minds will be concentrated as a result.",

The move comes after the Guardian revealed on Wednesday that the banker, who was once dubbed \u201cthe queen of the City\u201d and helped Green raise funds to buy the chain in 2000, was part of a team conducting due diligence on the retailer being led by Paul Sutton, a 59-year-old bankrupt businessman. Sutton was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment after being found guilty in absentia of embezzlement in France in 2002. The Guardian understands Saunders will be invited to appear in front of parliament\u2019s work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee, which are jointly taking evidence into the department store chain\u2019s demise. Saunders, who also advised Formula One tycoon Bernie Ecclestone, is credited with pushing through the deal that enabled Green\u2019s breakthrough acquisition of BHS 16 years ago. She went on to sit on the BHS board and received handsome dividends from the company before it merged with Green\u2019s Arcadia group in 2009. It is not clear how she came to work for Sutton. The news that such a well-known ally of Green was involved with a potential BHS bidder came after it emerged that funding from Guy and Alexander Dellal \u2013 the son and grandson of property investor \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal who helped to finance Green\u2019s takeover of retail group Sears in 1998 \u2013 helped push through Green\u2019s sale of BHS to Dominic Chappell last year. The Dellals provided \u00a335m to Chappell, whose consortium bought BHS in 2015, which he needed to show he was a credible buyer of the business. The Dellals\u2019 company, Allied Commercial Exporters, went on to make millions from a series of real-estate deals with BHS. The Dellals have already been asked to face the joint committee. BHS is to be liquidated barely a year after Chappell acquired it, leaving 11,000 staff out of work and the company with a pension fund in deficit to the tune of \u00a3571m. After acquiring the business, more than \u00a325m was paid out from BHS to Chappell\u2019s consortium, Retail Acquisitions. Chappell, who is due to answer questions on the retailer\u2019s collapse in front of the committee next week, was briefly a director of a company understood to be controlled by Sutton, while both men attended meetings together about acquiring BHS during 2014. Sutton was eventually ousted from the transaction when a dossier outlining his controversial history was sent to Green. Chappell then pressed ahead with his own deal, while Green demanded guarantees that Sutton was not involved.",

      "bodyText": "There were no fireworks from Vienna, with the European Central Bank keeping rates on hold and revising its inflation and growth figures only slightly higher, while Opec failed to agree on an output ceiling on oil. So investors remained cautious ahead of the US non-farm payroll numbers due on Friday. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 dipped 6.32 points or 0.1% to 6185.61 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.03% to 10,208.00 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.21% at 4466.00 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.24% to 17,767.30 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.46% at 8957.9 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.92% to 639.19 as the ECB said it had not yet decided on a waiver which would allow it to buy the country\u2019s bonds On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently virtually unchanged, down just 2.8 points or 0.02%. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Here\u2019s our report on the Opec meeting stalemate: Lingering hopes that Saudi Arabia and Iran could put aside their regional power struggle and reach a deal on oil production levels to help stabilise the volatile crude markets have been dashed. A ministerial meeting of the Opec oil-producing cartel broke up in Vienna without agreement on Thursday, with Tehran refusing to support a plan by Riyadh and others to freeze their crude output. The political logjam means the \u201cfragile five\u201d Opec members such as Nigeria, Venezuela, and Libya whose economies are almost completely dependent on petroleum revenues, will remain under pressure. The UK North Sea industry could see more layoffs and spending cuts but a lower oil price \u2013 currently just below $50 per barrel compared with the $100 level hit in the years prior to 2014 \u2013 is good for British motorists, manufacturers and homeowners. Opec put a brave face on its inaction, pointing out that the cost of crude had risen by 80% since its last summit in December. It said it had achieved the main purpose of the meeting, choosing a new secretary general, in Nigeria\u2019s Mohammed Barkindo. The full story is here: Back with Greece and the European Central Bank, and the prospect of reintroducing a waiver allowing the Bank to buy the country\u2019s bonds: There was talk of country quotas following the Opec meeting but..... Back with oil, and after a surprise build up of stocks reported on Wednesday by the American Petroleum Institute, there was a fall in inventories according to the latest weekly Energy Information Administration. EIA figures showed US crude stocks fell by 1.37m barrels, and despite being lower than the forecast 2.5m barrel draw, the news has given some support to oil prices which were hit by the earlier lack of agreement by Opec. Brent crude, having fallen as low as $48.84 a barrel is now down 0.6% at $49.40. Earlier of course there were also some US jobs figures, ahead of the non-farm payroll numbers on Friday. The ADP private sector payroll number came in exactly in line with forecasts, but ING Bank warns not to read too much into that as far as the non-farms are concerned. ING economist James Smith said: Although ADP\u2019s estimate of employment remained below 200,000 in May, we would caution against relying on it too heavily as a guide for tomorrow\u2019s labour report. In advance of this week\u2019s hotly-anticipated labour report, ADP\u2019s estimate of May\u2019s private payrolls came in (rather magically) exactly on consensus at 173,000. This figure may not have been adjusted for the Verizon strike, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has already said will remove approximately 35,000 workers from May\u2019s overall employment and this in principal, supports the view that non-farm payrolls (NFP) will come in below 200,000 again tomorrow. However, we would note that, whilst ADP use information from their client\u2019s payrolls, this is only one (possibly relatively small) part of the overall forecasting model that they employ. It is also a function of last month\u2019s official payrolls data (ie an autoregressive model) and a business conditions index (which is composed of activity data such as industrial production and GDP). As a result, we would caution against relying too heavily on this estimate of NFP, as the information specifically contained about May\u2019s labour market performance may be fairly limited. Despite the strike-related distortion, we feel that Friday\u2019s consensus figure is a little low. Although it is possible that job creation is slowing as the economy reaches something close to full employment, the high month-on-month volatility (arising from several factors, not least statistical/seasonal adjustment gyrations) in NFP means that the risk of a higher reading than last month (160,000) is arguably greater than the risk of a lower one. We look for something at or above what we consider to be the current underlying trend (roughly 180,000-185,000). That said, we feel that the key to the next Federal Reserve Open Market Committee rate hike does not lie within the labour report. As recent speeches/statements have shown, the Fed\u2019s labour market check-box is effectively already \u201cticked\u201d and thus the timing of the next move depends more on how FOMC members perceive the recovery in activity data to have been since a weak first quarter. In that regard, the final (and probably definitive) green or red light to a June hike will come from Chair Yellen\u2019s speech on Monday. On balance, although many of the FOMC\u2019s conditions for a hike have arguably been largely met, we feel that they are more likely to wait until the third quarter (most likely July), when the UK referendum event risk has passed. It\u2019s been a busy couple of hours, what with the European Central Bank and the collapse of BHS. And of course Opec. On the outcome of the oil producers\u2019 meeting, chief market analyst at FXTM Jameel Ahmad said: There was never a chance that Opec would cut production today, meaning there are no real surprises from the outcome of this meeting resulting in OPEC failing to reach an output deal. While the oil markets are finding themselves under pressure and encountering selling momentum as a result of the announcement, it is important to point out that the oil markets have been meeting sellers around $50 now for the past fortnight and this is currently seen as a \u201ctop\u201d for the commodity. To put it quite simply, there was very little need for Opec to change their strategy today and it is important to point out that the price of oil has rebounded substantially since the milestone lows below $30 at the beginning of 2016. There are also reports that major institutions such as Opec and the IEA are expecting a dramatic decline in global inventories over the second half of 2016, which would be very supportive and positive to the chances of a further comeback in the price of oil for the remainder of the year. Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, agrees that today\u2019s ECB press conference wasn\u2019t a hummdinger: \u201cVery little was added to the mix during today\u2019s press conference apart from a start date for corporate bond purchases*. The bottom line is that the outlook for inflation remains grim, but the ECB is not likely to act until it has no other choice, due to vague hopes of energy prices propping up inflation in the near future. * - that start date is June 8th Elsewhere in Vienna, the news that oil producers have not agreed on a ceiling on output ( not exactly a big surprise) has sent crude prices lower. But Opec members are putting a brave face on it, and Saudi Arabia has said it is open to a policy change at the end of the year. And as expected the group did elect Nigeria\u2019s Mohammed Barkindo as the group\u2019s secretary general. The sad collapse of BHS this afternoon mean there will be even more pressure on its former owner, Sir Phillip Green, when he testifies to parliament later this month. MPs will surely ask Green about the dividends paid to his family during the good times, and the deficit in the BHS pension fund. Dominic Chapell, who bought BHS for a pound, is also going to face some stern questions. Jon Copestake, chief retail &amp; consumer goods analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, explains: Many employees facing the loss of livelihood will no doubt be paying close attention to the scheduled appearances of Dominic Chapell and Sir Philip Green before the work and pensions committee over the next two weeks. The question of how company executives were able to extract so much money from the retailer during its 16 year drift into liquidation will no doubt be high on the agenda, especially since the failure of a retail brand like BHS has been something that any visitor to its half empty stores in recent years might have made an educated guess at. BHS\u2019s failure comes just two days after Austin Reed went under, Copestake adds: For those looking for a silver lining respite will be scant. BHS and Austin Reed had a combined high street presence of over 280 stores, with closures likely to make a tangible impression on some high streets. As with all fire sales, the best assets will no doubt be picked up cheaply and resurrected by more successful retailers, which will make some dent in the job losses, but many will not as the British High Street continues to undergo a painful correction to accommodate changing shopper habits. That wasn\u2019t the most dramatic press conference in the European Central Bank\u2019s history, so what did we learn? Mario Draghi has joined the ranks of global policymakers warning against Brexit. The ECB president singled out this month\u2019s referendum as a clear \u2018downside risk\u2019 to growth. Draghi also acknowledged that Brexit is a possibility. He argued that Britain and the EU are both better together: The ECB has a view that the UK should remain in the European Union, because the European Union would benefit from its presence. And we believe the UK would benefit from being in the European Union too. But also revealed that the ECB is planning for all eventualities, without giving details of its emergency plan. The eurozone economy is still weak. The ECB revised up its forecast for Eurozone growth this year, from 1.4% to 1.6%, but revised down its 2018 forecast. Draghi said: \u201cInflation rates are likely to remain very low or negative in the next few months before picking up in the second half of 2016 ... Supported by our monetary policy measures and the expected economic recovery inflation rates should recover further in 2017 and 2018.\u201d But the ECB has barely tweaked its inflation forecasts -only raising 2016\u2019s forecast from 0.1% to 0.2%. Insignificant, really. There\u2019s no help for Greece, yet. The Athens stock market has dipped, after Draghi said the ECB wasn\u2019t ready to start accepting Greek bonds as collateral. That\u2019s a reminder that Greece\u2019s bailout woes aren\u2019t over. Draghi says the ECB can do more. His statement began with the traditional pledge to keep doing whatever is needed to maintain price stability. He also hinted that the QE bond-buying scheme could be extended beyond March 2017, if needed. Bad news in the UK retail sector. Attempts to find a buyer for BHS, the department store, have failed. The administrators who have been running the company for the last month have just called in liquidators. Around 11,000 jobs are now at serious risk, and redundancies could start today. My colleague Graham Ruddick has the details: And finally.... Q: What structural reforms does the ECB most want to see implemented by eurozone governments? Draghi won\u2019t be lured into telling European leaders what to do. National governments know what\u2019s most important on their own patch, he smiles. But he does highlight the important of labour market reforms - a major issue in his home country, Italy. And that\u2019s the end of the ECB press conference. Q: Given Europe\u2019s persistently weak inflation rate, should the ECB alter its target (currently 2%) to something more achievable? Dreadful idea, Draghi insists. That would seriously undermine the bank\u2019s credibility, raising the \u2018risk premium\u2019 on eurozone assets, driving real interest rates higher, and ultimately making it harder to ensure price stability. So he opposes raising, or lowering the inflation goal. Tom Fairless of the Wall Street Journal then puts Draghi on the spot, asking: Q: Would the ECB would really halt its QE programme next March, given it expects inflation to be just 1.6% in 2018? Draghi says the ECB would not hesitate to act, if needed, to drive inflation up. We can adjust the program in a way that could meet the desired size. We are willing and ready to do so. Back at the ECB meeting, Draghi is asked about speculation that the decision to abolish the \u20ac500 note is part of a secret plot to get rid of cash. It\u2019s simply not true, the ECB president insists. We are printing more \u20ac200 notes, to make up for the end of the \u20ac500 one. More drama in Vienna! The Opec meeting of oil ministers has broken up, without a deal on production caps. That\u2019s not a great surprise, given Iran\u2019s opposition to the supply curbs which some countries, including Saudi, had apparently been pushing for. But it has knocked the oil price down by around 1%. Another question: Is Mario Draghi worried about the impact on savers from record low interest rates? Draghi agrees that this is a concern in several countries, not just Germany (where savers are particularly irked). But he insists that loose monetary policy is essential now, to help the eurozone economy back to health. He adds: For interest rates to be higher tomorrow, they must be low today. The markets aren\u2019t happy that the ECB hasn\u2019t welcomed Greek bonds back to the fold today: Mario Draghi then declares that the European Central Bank believes Britain should stay in the European Union. Asked about the June 23 referendum (which he called a \u2018downside risk\u2019) Draghi tells the press conference in Vienna that: \u201cThe ECB is ready for any outcome.\u201d He argues that a victory for the Remain campaign would be in the best interests of Britain, and Europe. Draghi says: Of course... the UK and Europe and the eurozone are mutually beneficial. The ECB has a view that the UK should remain in the European Union, because the European Union would benefit from its presence. And we believe the UK would benefit from being in the European Union too. He concludes: The ECB is ready for all contingencies. Q: Why has the ECB not reinstated the \u2018waiver\u2019 on Greek bonds, allowing them to be used for its programmes? Draghi says the governing council discussed the issue, and acknowledges the \u2018significant progress\u2019 which Greece has made recently with its lenders. However, he points out that Athens still has a few \u2018prior actions\u2019 to take, before it fully satisfies its creditors. Once the prior actions are implemented in Greece, the Governing Council will discuss the reinstatement of the waiver, Draghi promises. Onto questions... Q: Why are the ECB\u2019s forecasts not more optimistic, given the stimulus measures it has taken? Draghi says the ECB needs to see the impact of the measures it drew up in March. But he insists that its policies have \u201cmade a lot of difference\u201d, and been very effective. Mario Draghi ends his statement with his traditional call for eurozone governments to implement structural reforms. He singles out the EC\u2019s \u201cJuncker Plan\u201d, saying this spending plan needs to be boosted. The ECB has only made small adjustments to its inflation forecasts, dashing hopes that price inflation could get close to the 2% target by the end of 2018. Mario Draghi then warns that the risks to the global economy are to the downside. And he cites this month\u2019s British referendum as one downside risk, along with other geopolitical risks. Draghi also warns that eurozone inflation is likely to remain very low, or negative, for some time. It\u2019s currently minus 0.1%. Draghi says the ECB has revised its growth forecast for 2016 to +1.6%, from +1.4% before. However, it has left its forecasts for the next two years unchanged. Mario Draghi starts his press conference by confirming that the governing council left borrowing costs at record lows. They will stay at their current levels, or lower, for an \u2018extended period\u2019. And he confirms that the ECB will continue to run its QE bond-buying scheme until March 2017, or until inflation is returning back to target. Draghi also explains that the ECB will start buying debt issued by companies on 8 June, as part of the stimulus programme announced back in March. He says the economic recovery is \u2018gradually\u2019 proceeding, but warns that vigilance is needed to prevent low inflation becoming entrenched. So the governing council will use \u2018all instruments\u2019 at its disposal to achieve its objectives. Draghi is early! You can watch the press conference here. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is about to hold a press conference in Vienna, after leaving interest rates at record lows. Here\u2019s what investors and commentators will be watching for: Is Draghi more optimistic about the economy? The eurozone growth figures for the first quarter of 2016 were better than expected, and inflation is close to turning positive again. The ECB\u2019s new economic forecasts. Economists will have created new projections for today\u2019s meeting; could they show inflation rising faster than expected? Is it about to help Greece? Athens is hoping that ECB could reinstall the \u2018waiver\u2019 on Greek bonds, which would allow them to be used as collateral for its liquidity operations soon. A tiny gobbet of US economic news, while we wait for the ECB press conference. US private sector companies created 173,000 new jobs in May, which (remarkably) is exactly what Wall Street had expected. Yes, economists got a forecast right. That\u2019s up from 166k last month (which has been revised up from 155k). It suggests tomorrow\u2019s US Non-Farm Payroll (the main measure of the jobs market) won\u2019t be a shock. Breaking: The European Central Bank has left eurozone interest rates unchanged at their current record lows. So... The headline interest rate remains at 0.00% The deposit rate (on bank deposits left at the ECB) stays at -0.4% The marginal lending facility (paid by banks to borrow from the ECB) stays at +0.25% The ECB also reveals that it will start buying corporate bonds on June 8, under its latest stimulus plan. We\u2019ll get more details after Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference, which starts in 45 minutes. Here comes the ECB\u2019s monetary policy decision...... Reporting from OPEC\u2019s meeting is more dangerous than I thought. Footage has just emerged of a cameraman in Vienna clattering into a glass door, while trying to film Iran\u2019s Bijan Namdar Zangeneh. Update: The intrepid cameraman was Bloomberg\u2019s Rae Hurring, who we hope isn\u2019t damaged. Bond trading giant Pimco has now issued its new Global Outlook report. It warns that the world economy is \u201cStable But Not Secure\u201d, and sees growing dangers as monetary policy reaches its limits. Pimco cites some familiar themes \u2013 persistently low inflation, high debt levels, China\u2019s slowing economy and the problems in the eurozone. And it fears those problems could get steadily worse... Here\u2019s the key points: In the absence of structural reforms, we are approaching the limits of central bank policy. Increasingly experimental policy is creating greater uncertainty and stretching valuations. Unsustainable debt levels mean that long-term risks of capital impairment or inflation are rising. Political uncertainty is increasing. Greater regulation and related reduced transactional liquidity are enhancing local market volatility. More here. European stock markets have crept up this morning, as investors watch for developments in Vienna. The FTSE 100 is up 27 points, or almost half a percent. That ends a two-day losing streak, and means the index is almost flat for 2016 again. Nick Fletcher\u2019s market report has full details of what\u2019s up and down: And here\u2019s the situation across Europe: Back in the UK, investment management firm Pimco has predicted that there\u2019s a decent chance Britain will vote to leave the EU later this month. Reuters has the details: PIMCO managing director Mike Amey put the likelihood of Britain voting to stay in the EU at about 60 percent. Bookmakers price the chance of a \u201cRemain\u201d vote higher, at about 80 percent, while opinion polls suggest the two sides are evenly split. \u201cThere\u2019s a pretty significant chance that we leave,\u201d Amey told reporters. \u201cIt would be a significant event for the UK, but it wouldn\u2019t be a globally systemic event. It wouldn\u2019t derail the global economy.\u201d That doesn\u2019t chime with the OECD\u2019s view; yesterday, the Paris-based group argued that Brexit would be as serious as China\u2019s economy suffering a \u2018hard-lining\u2019. Sebastien Marlier, senior commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit, agrees that little is expected from today\u2019s OPEC meeting: It comes so soon after the failed Doha meeting, as OPEC countries seem increasingly divided and as supply disruptions have already done much to lift prices. But despite that, there are three key issues to watch: The new Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, for any clues on changes in Saudi\u2019s oil policy. On that front we expect broad continuity. Although he may attempt to strike a conciliatory tone, Saudi Arabia\u2019s focus on market share and on sustaining high output is unlikely to change given the return to the market of its regional competitor, Iran, and the planned Aramco IPO in 2017. Tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which have been the main culprits of the \u201cfreeze\u201d fiasco. Ongoing disagreements suggest that an agreement on production quotas is unlikely just yet. The fragile five (Nigeria, Venezuela, Libya, Algeria, Iraq) for clues about their desperate financial situation and production prospects. Mystery of missing shoe solved!! It belonged to Leslie Hayward, the managing editor of @EnergyFuse. She parted company with a rather fetching pump in the mass scrum to get into the OPEC meeting room. We recommend hefty walking boots on these occasions -- great for slowing down one\u2019s rivals.... This chart shows how the Brent crude oil price has risen steadily since January, when it hit just $28 per barrel. Today\u2019s meeting comes two months after Opec failed to get any deal on production cuts at an emergency meeting in Doha. The oil price has actually risen by over 10% since then, as production cuts by non-Opec members have eliminated the supply glut. And that\u2019s why its hard to see a deal to curb production today. With oil at $50 per barrel, ministers must be tempted to sit tight and hope prices rise on their own. Also, getting Iran to accept production curbs is clearly a non-starter. Tehran is still celebrating the end of international sanctions on oil production, so is obviously reluctant to reimpose them itself. Journalists in Vienna are being offered a hearty array of biscuits and crisps to keep them on the go: No more word on the missing shoe, though.... The Financial Times reckons Saudi Arabia\u2019s is changing its strategy, after telling reporters that Opec should \u201csteward the market\u201d [see earlier post]. Their correspondents Anjli Raval and David Sheppard write: Khalid Al Falih, speaking at the Opec secretariat prior to the group\u2019s twice-yearly meeting, said the group should \u201cencourage the rebalancing to take place\u201d and said the kingdom wanted to avoid any oil shocks, dampening fears Saudi Arabia is preparing to raise production significantly. \u201cWhatever action we take will be taking into consideration that the market is doing quite well by itself, so we will be very gentle in our approach,\u201d said Mr Al Falih. Saudi Arabia is expected to propose reinstating the group\u2019s production ceiling, which was removed entirely at the December gathering of ministers. The OPEC meeting began with a warning that the global economy remains weak. Dr. Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Qatar\u2019s Minister of Energy and Industry, told delegates that: With regard to global economic growth, the story remains somewhat patchy. While the estimated 2016 growth of 3.1 per cent is higher than that of 2015, it has been revised down slightly since our December meeting. World oil demand this year remains healthy, with growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day. The majority of this will come from non-OECD countries, but OECD countries are also expected to see some growth in every quarter this year. Al Sada also pointed out that non-OPEC members are cutting their production, in response to the tumble in the oil price last year: From the supply perspective, in the first half of this year, we have seen a further downward revision to the 2016 outlook for non-OPEC supply. We now anticipate a contraction of 740,000 barrels per day this year. This is more than 2 million barrels per day lower than the growth of 2015. This trend stems mainly from reduced cashflows, investment cutbacks and the deferral or cancellation of projects. Al Sada says this suggests that the oil market is balancing (as Saudi minister Khalid al-Falih also said). But he\u2019s also concerned that stocks levels are still high - and hints that production targets should be considered. The five-year average for OECD commercial stocks is currently at a surplus of around 360 million barrels. It is important that we take note of this figure on a downward trend. A more stable and balanced market will be beneficial to all. Here\u2019s the full statement: Opening address to the 169th Meeting of the OPEC Conference Alex Schindelar, news editor at Energy Intelligence Group, reckons few OPEC ministers will push for production curbs in Vienna. Energy analyst Joe McMonigle is tweeting from the Opec meeting. He doesn\u2019t see any signs of a production cap today: OPEC have now cleared the room of journalists, after allowing them to poke dictaphones under ministerial noses in the hope of a juicy quote. At least one reporter is hobbling around.... The United Arab Emirates has put its finger on OPEC\u2019s fundamental problem.... Algeria\u2019s representative has suggested that Opec might agree quotas for each country, rather than a flat cap. Angola\u2019s oil minister told reporters that there is \u201ca possibility\u201d of setting an oil output ceiling today. Jose Botelho de Vasconcelos added that the prospect of $60 per barrel oil is \u201cnot bad\u201d, but $80/barrel \u201cwould be better\u201d. Better for Opec, but not for consumers and oil importers, of course. The OPEC meeting is underway! And there\u2019s a flurry of action in Vienna as energy correspondents try to grab a word with energy ministers. Saudi\u2019s new oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, says the market is rebalancing, and the oil price will respond to that. He argues that the market is not currently over-supplied, but there are inventories that need to be \u201cabsorbed\u201d. OPEC should help that rebalancing process to continue, to help create long-term stability, he adds. The oil price has just broken through the $50 mark, as the OPEC meeting gets underway. Brent crude is up 0.8% at $50.12 per barrel, a one-week high. However, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s because investors are expecting a production cap to be agreed today, given Iran\u2019s opposition.... Here\u2019s some good news for the ECB to savour over their morning coffee -- Spain\u2019s unemployment total has hit a six-year low. The jobless total dropped by almost 120,000 in May, the biggest monthly fall in almost two years. That takes the number of people out of work to below four million. That\u2019s a relief for Madrid, but it still leaves Spain with the second worst unemployment rate (after Greece) at around 20%. There\u2019s tight security in Austria today as OPEC oil ministers arrive: Fortunately, the two meetings won\u2019t clash too badly. CET is one hour ahead of BST. The ECB will announce its decision on interest rates at 1.45pm local time (12.45pm UK), and then hold a press conference from 2.30-3.30pm (or 1.30-2.30pm UK time) Iran has slapped down the idea that OPEC could agree production limits at today\u2019s meeting. The Iranian minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said a cap wouldn\u2019t benefit Iran - or other cartel members either. Zanganeh told reporters in Vienna that: One of our main ideas is to have country quotas, but I don\u2019t think we can reach an agreement on this subject at this meeting. The OPEC oil ministers will have to take one decision in Vienna today - electing a new secretary general. Our energy editor, Terry Macalister, explains: Mohammed Barkindo, a former boss of Nigeria\u2019s national oil company, is in pole position to be installed as front man for the oil cartel, whose lack of internal unity leaves it unable to take decisive action. But otherwise, little firm action is expected, as the oil price has recently risen back to $50 per barrel. The laissez-faire consensus more likely to prevail was outlined by Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei, the energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, who said: \u201cSupply and demand are working and this is the element of this (Opec) policy. From the beginning of the year until now, the market has been correcting itself upward. This is the year of correction.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Vienna is often dubbed the cultural capital of Europe, thanks to the influence of Strauss, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert et al. But today it\u2019s the financial news capital of Europe too. The European Central Bank\u2019s governing council has decamped from Frankfurt to Austria, for its latest monetary policy meeting. They\u2019ll be setting interest rates, discussing the effectiveness of its latest stimulus package, and then holding a press conference. We\u2019re not expecting any big announcements, as it\u2019s only three months since the ECB dramatically slashed rates and announced a series of new measures. Instead, investors want to hear whether those measures are working. The ECB will also issue fresh economic forecasts, which will show if it sees inflation (currently -0.1%) returning to the 2% target. ECB chief Mario Draghi will also field questions about Greece\u2019s debt crisis, the banking sector, and perhaps even Britain\u2019s EU referendum. 12.45pm BST: ECB interest rate decision 1.30pm BST: ECB press conference Cheap oil has dragged Europe\u2019s inflation rate into negative territory. So it\u2019s appropriate that OPEC is also meeting in Vienna for its twice-yearly meeting. This is a chance for the cartel to discuss how to set production levels to their best advantage. Back in the 1970s, OPEC\u2019s members had huge power over the oil sector, so its meetings were Big Events. To be honest, OPEC isn\u2019t the force it once was \u2013 previous attempts to cap production to drive the oil price have failed, and oil analysts don\u2019t expect many fireworks today Having said that....there was some chatter last night that OPEC could set some sort of output ceiling, so you never know.... It\u2019s good news for Austria\u2019s tourism sector, anyway. Also coming up..... We find out how many private sector jobs were created in America last month, when the monthly ADP jobs report is released. That will set the tone for tomorrow\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll After two days of falls, European stock markets are expected to dip this morning as investors watch events in Vienna. And the Bank of England will be unveiling the final design of its first ever plastic note this afternoon. The new \u00a35 note will be proudly produced at Blenheim Palace - birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, who appears on the back of it.",

ING economist James Smith said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although ADP\u2019s estimate of employment remained below 200,000 in May, we would caution against relying on it too heavily as a guide for tomorrow\u2019s labour report.</p> <p>In advance of this week\u2019s hotly-anticipated labour report, ADP\u2019s estimate of May\u2019s private payrolls came in (rather magically) exactly on consensus at 173,000. This figure may not have been adjusted for the Verizon strike, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has already said will remove approximately 35,000 workers from May\u2019s overall employment and this in principal, supports the view that non-farm payrolls (NFP) will come in below 200,000 again tomorrow.</p> <p>However, we would note that, whilst ADP use information from their client\u2019s payrolls, this is only one (possibly relatively small) part of the overall forecasting model that they employ. It is also a function of last month\u2019s official payrolls data (ie an autoregressive model) and a business conditions index (which is composed of activity data such as industrial production and GDP). As a result, we would caution against relying too heavily on this estimate of NFP, as the information specifically contained about May\u2019s labour market performance may be fairly limited.</p> <p>Despite the strike-related distortion, we feel that Friday\u2019s consensus figure is a little low.</p> <p>Although it is possible that job creation is slowing as the economy reaches something close to full employment, the high month-on-month volatility (arising from several factors, not least statistical/seasonal adjustment gyrations) in NFP means that the risk of a higher reading than last month (160,000) is arguably greater than the risk of a lower one. We look for something at or above what we consider to be the current underlying trend (roughly 180,000-185,000).</p> <p>That said, we feel that the key to the next Federal Reserve Open Market Committee rate hike does not lie within the labour report. As recent speeches/statements have shown, the Fed\u2019s labour market check-box is effectively already \u201cticked\u201d and thus the timing of the next move depends more on how FOMC members perceive the recovery in activity data to have been since a weak first quarter.</p> <p>In that regard, the final (and probably definitive) green or red light to a June hike will come from Chair Yellen\u2019s speech on Monday. On balance, although many of the FOMC\u2019s conditions for a hike have arguably been largely met, we feel that they are more likely to wait until the third quarter (most likely July), when the UK referendum event risk has passed.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b49c17f27b5c8181cf439c7a722d4b22bd5277f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b49c17f27b5c8181cf439c7a722d4b22bd5277f/295_0_2911_1747/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Federal Reserve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T15:04:04.803Z\">at 4.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-575045e8e4b00d22af5dfb03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T14:49:54.264Z\">3.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s been a busy couple of hours, what with the European Central Bank and the collapse of BHS.

While the estimated 2016 growth of 3.1 per cent is higher than that of 2015, it has been revised down slightly since our December meeting.</p> <p>World oil demand this year remains healthy, with growth of over 1.2 million barrels per day. The majority of this will come from non-OECD countries, but OECD countries are also expected to see some growth in every quarter this year.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Al Sada also pointed out that non-OPEC members are cutting their production, in response to the tumble in the oil price last year: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From the supply perspective, in the first half of this year, we have seen a further downward revision to the 2016 outlook for non-OPEC supply. We now anticipate a contraction of 740,000 barrels per day this year. This is more than 2 million barrels per day lower than the growth of 2015.</p> <p>This trend stems mainly from reduced cashflows, investment cutbacks and the deferral or cancellation of projects.</p> </blockquote> <p>Al Sada says this suggests that the oil market is balancing (as Saudi minister Khalid al-Falih also said). <strong>But he\u2019s also concerned that stocks levels are still high - and hints that production targets should be considered.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The five-year average for OECD commercial stocks is currently at a surplus of around 360 million barrels. It is important that we take note of this figure on a downward trend.</p> <p>A more stable and balanced market will be beneficial to all.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here\u2019s the full statement:</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/press_room/3486.htm\">Opening address to the 169th Meeting of the OPEC Conference</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/738294307648602112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Opening address to the 169th Meeting of the OPEC Conference <a href=\"https://t.co/g0ZysLNIkg\">https://t.co/g0ZysLNIkg</a></p>&mdash; Livesquawk (@Livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Livesquawk/status/738294307648602112\">June 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T09:35:16.738Z\">at 10.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-574ff58ee4b03b568f2bf76e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T09:03:13.990Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Alex Schindelar, </strong>news<strong> </strong>editor at <strong>Energy Intelligence Group, </strong>reckons few OPEC ministers will push for production curbs in Vienna.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Alex_Schindelar/status/738293752377266177\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Nothing too illuminating out of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Opec?src=hash\">#Opec</a> &quot;gang bang&quot; except most ministers do not seem to have much problem with doing nothing.</p>&mdash; Alex Schindelar (@Alex_Schindelar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alex_Schindelar/status/738293752377266177\">June 2, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-574ff486e4b03b568f2bf764\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-06-02T08:59:28.922Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Energy analyst <strong>Joe McMonigle</strong> is tweeting from the Opec meeting.

      "bodyText": "Lingering hopes that Saudi Arabia and Iran would put aside their regional power struggle and reach a deal on oil production levels to help stabilise the volatile crude markets have been dashed. A ministerial meeting of the Opec oil-producing cartel broke up in Vienna without agreement on Thursday, with Tehran refusing to support a plan by Riyadh and others to freeze their crude output. The political logjam means the \u201cfragile five\u201d Opec members, including Nigeria, Venezuela, and Libya, whose economies are almost completely dependent on petroleum revenues, will remain under pressure. The UK North Sea industry could see more layoffs and spending cuts but a lower oil price \u2013 currently just below $50 per barrel compared with the $100 level reached in the years prior to 2014 \u2013 is good for British motorists, manufacturers and homeowners. Opec put a brave face on its inaction, pointing out that the cost of crude had risen by 80% since its last summit in December. It said it had achieved the main purpose of the meeting, choosing a new secretary general, in Nigeria\u2019s Mohammed Barkindo. \u201cSupply and demand is converging and oil and [refined] product stock levels in the OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] have recently shown relative moderation,\u201d said the cartel in a formal statement to end the event. Saudi Arabia, led by its new energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, had been pushing for \u201ccoordinated action\u201d to hold down production but would not proceed without the cooperation of Iran. Bijan Zanganeh, the Iranian minister, made clear that his country wanted to enjoy its new-found freedom to produce and export higher volumes of crude after the deal over its nuclear programme and the dropping of western sanctions. He said a production cap would have no benefit for Iran. The depressed state of the oil markets has caused intense political as well as economic upheaval in places such as Venezuela and Brazil, where there have been large street demonstrations aimed at government leaders. Venezuela, which has the largest oil reserves in the world, is dogged by chronic shortages of basic goods and essential medicines, electricity and water rationing, spiraling inflation and rampant crime. Russia and Kazakhstan, which are major oil producers outside Opec, have also seen their public finances damaged, while even Saudi Arabia has introduced a wave of new taxes and plans to sell a stake in its national oil company, Saudi Aramco. The value of oil reached $115 per barrel this time two years ago but the growth of US shale output coupled with faltering demand and a stagnant global economy knocked the confidence out of the market. The price of Brent blend hit $28 in February but has recovered to about $50 as US output declines and production has been hit by a series of problems such as bushfires in Canada and militants attacking pipelines in Nigeria. Multinational oil companies such as BP, Shell and Exxon Mobil have all slashed their capital spending, leading to warnings from Opec that this could eventually feed through into supply shortages.",

      "bodyText": "Mark Carney, has formally unveiled the Bank of England\u2019s first plastic banknote, the new fiver featuring Sir Winston Churchill. The transition to plastic notes is a significant departure for a central bank that has used paper money since it was established more than 320 years ago. Launching the note at Blenheim Palace, birthplace and ancestral home of the late wartime leader, Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the new polymer note was a major innovation and was cleaner, safer and longer-lasting than paper. \u201cIt is resistant to dirt and moisture, so the note won\u2019t wear out as quickly as the current fivers but will stay in good condition for longer,\u201d Carney said. \u201cIt is stronger than paper and can better withstand being repeatedly folded into wallets or scrunched up inside pockets. Polymer notes can survive a splash of Claret, a flick of cigar ash, the nip of a bulldog, and even a spin in the washing machine afterwards to boot.\u201d At a cost of 7.4p a note, the new fiver is about twice as expensive to produce as the paper note but will cost less over time according to the Bank because it will last on average around five years \u2013 two-and-a-half times longer. The longer life makes them more environmentally friendly, too, the Bank claims. They are almost impossible to tear, meaning there will be no longer any need to patch a torn note back together with sticky tape. It will be introduced into circulation from 13 September, with 440m recyclable notes rolling off the presses and distributed at cash machines around the country. The event was attended by members of Churchill\u2019s family, including his grandson Sir Nicholas Soames and granddaughter Celia Sandys. In choosing Churchill for the new note, the Bank was commemorating the former prime minister\u2019s \u201cbulldog spirit\u201d, Carney said. \u201cChurchill was not just a martial leader \u2013 though he was an exceptional one \u2013 he was also one of the greatest statesmen of all time.\u201d Soames said his grandfather would have been happy to feature on the new \u00a35 note: \u201cI think it\u2019s the most marvellous tribute to Churchill, it\u2019s a very handsome and generous tribute. I think the fiver is the note most of us use most of the time. I think he\u2019d be chuffed to bits to think he was on the people\u2019s banknote and he would never have expected it. \u201cHe was [also] chancellor of the exchequer, but I have to say not a very good one. I think he\u2019d be thrilled and certainly his family are very honoured and thrilled that 51 years after his death he should be remembered in this way.\u201d Members of the public were able to get their hands on the new note at an interactive exhibition held at the Oxfordshire palace to mark the launch, scrunching them up and dunking them in liquids. Ben Smith, 14, gave it a warm reception: \u201cIt\u2019s really good. I tried to tear it but it\u2019s virtually impossible. I think it\u2019s good that Churchill is on it because he\u2019s such an iconic figure in British history.\u201d His mother, Michelle, 46, said they felt stronger than the old note, \u201cyou can imagine they will last a lot longer\u201d. Over at one stand, 10-year-old twins Matthew and Joshua Tyreman enjoyed watching the old and new notes get dunked in Ribena. \u201cWhen [the new fiver] comes out it it\u2019s fine, it doesn\u2019t get soaked like the paper version,\u201d Matthew said. The brothers both preferred the plastic note. The fiver will be followed by a new plastic Jane Austen \u00a310 note in the summer of 2017, with a plastic JMW Turner \u00a320 note by 2020. A decision has yet to made on the \u00a350 note. Carney said banknotes had cultural as well as economic value: \u201cBy depicting characters on our banknotes, we celebrate those who have advanced British thought, spurred innovation, shown exceptional leadership, shaped this diverse society and forged its common values. \u201cIn these regards, money is memory for a country and its people. Our banknotes are testaments to the outstanding achievements of the nation\u2019s greatest individuals; they are repositories of the United Kingdom\u2019s collective memory.\u201d The Bank will start to withdraw the old paper fivers as soon as the new ones are circulated. They will remain legal tender until May 2017. Plastic notes are already used in more than 30 countries, including Carney\u2019s native Canada, Australia and Singapore.\u201c As Churchill did, we may have to wait a while for the Americans to join up,\u201d Carney said. The image of Churchill on the new plastic fiver is taken from a portrait captured by Yousuf Karsh in Ottawa, Canada, in December 1941. \u201cThe famous glower of the war-time hero prompted, in this case, by the photographer\u2019s decision to take Churchill\u2019s cigar away from him,\u201d Carney said. Behind the portrait is an image of the Houses of Parliament, featuring the Great Clock on Big Ben with the hands set to 3 o\u2019clock, the approximate time on 13 May 1940 when Churchill made his inaugural speech to the Commons as prime minister. \u201cI have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat,\u201d he said during the speech, a quote that appears beneath his portrait on the note. The Bank has warned the public that brand new polymer notes can stick together \u2013 meaning shoppers could mistakenly hand over two notes instead of one \u2013 but said the effect tends to wear off quickly once in use. They are not completely indestructible, nor are they counterfeit-proof, but illegally copying them should be a slower and more costly process. Carney said the plastic notes allowed for better security features than their paper counterparts, including see-through panels, coloured foils, detailed metallic images and tactile features to help visually impaired people recognise different notes. The \u00a310 and \u00a320 notes will have a tactile feature, while the \u00a35 note will be distinguishable by the absence of one. The security features on the new plastic fiver include: A see-through window featuring the Queen\u2019s portrait. The border of the window changes from purple to green. Big Ben shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back. A hologram that contains the word \u201cFive\u201d and changes to \u201cPounds\u201d when the note is tilted. The words \u201cBank of England\u201d printed in raised ink along the top of the note. The Bank spent around \u00a370m on the research, development and printing of the new banknotes.The plastic cash will be about 15% smaller than paper money, bringing them in line with international sizes. Scotland is expected to introduce its own \u00a35 polymer note in late 2016. Clydesdale Bank launched a limited edition commemorative polymer \u00a35 note in March 2015. Northern Ireland has no plans to replace paper notes, although a commemorative polymer \u00a35 note issued in 2000 is still in circulation. Carney announced the move to plastic notes shortly after he arrived at the Bank in 2013. However, the Bank\u2019s notes division had been considering the switch for years. The move to plastic is the latest in a long line of changes for banknotes, first issued in return for deposits by the Bank, when it was established in 1694, to raise money for William III\u2019s war against France. Coloured \u00a35 notes replaced white ones in the 1950s; the first portrayal of a monarch came in 1960, when the Queen appeared on a new \u00a31 note; and the introduction of historical figures such as William Shakespeare started in the 1970s. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2016 as it incorrectly stated the new \u00a35 note was Britain\u2019s first plastic one.",

In choosing Churchill for the new note, the Bank was commemorating the former prime minister\u2019s \u201cbulldog spirit\u201d, Carney said. \u201cChurchill was not just a martial leader \u2013 though he was an exceptional one \u2013 he was also one of the greatest statesmen of all time.\u201d</p> <p>Soames said his grandfather would have been happy to feature on the new \u00a35 note: \u201cI think it\u2019s the most marvellous tribute to Churchill, it\u2019s a very handsome and generous tribute. I think the fiver is the note most of us use most of the time. I think he\u2019d be chuffed to bits to think he was on the people\u2019s banknote and he would never have expected it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da7341272dc72dce58a4b53723bb883eb5e6a2bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da7341272dc72dce58a4b53723bb883eb5e6a2bd/55_0_913_548/500.jpg\" alt=\"The front of the new \u00a35 note.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The front of the new \u00a35 note.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bank of England</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe was [also] chancellor of the exchequer, but I have to say not a very good one. I think he\u2019d be thrilled and certainly his family are very honoured and thrilled that 51 years after his death he should be remembered in this way.\u201d</p> <p>Members of the public were able to get their hands on the new note at an interactive exhibition held at the Oxfordshire palace to mark the launch, scrunching them up and dunking them in liquids. Ben Smith, 14, gave it a warm reception: \u201cIt\u2019s really good. I tried to tear it but it\u2019s virtually impossible. I think it\u2019s good that Churchill is on it because he\u2019s such an iconic figure in British history.\u201d His mother, Michelle, 46, said they felt stronger than the old note, \u201cyou can imagine they will last a lot longer\u201d.</p> <p>Over at one stand, 10-year-old twins Matthew and Joshua Tyreman enjoyed watching the old and new notes get dunked in Ribena. \u201cWhen [the new fiver] comes out it it\u2019s fine, it doesn\u2019t get soaked like the paper version,\u201d Matthew said. The brothers both preferred the plastic note.</p> <p>The fiver will be followed by a new plastic Jane Austen \u00a310 note in the summer of 2017, with a plastic JMW Turner \u00a320 note by 2020. A decision has yet to made on the \u00a350 note.<br></p> <p>Carney said banknotes had cultural as well as economic value: \u201cBy depicting characters on our banknotes, we celebrate those who have advanced British thought, spurred innovation, shown exceptional leadership, shaped this diverse society and forged its common values. \u201cIn these regards, money is memory for a country and its people. Our banknotes are testaments to the outstanding achievements of the nation\u2019s greatest individuals; they are repositories of the United Kingdom\u2019s collective memory.\u201d</p> <p> The Bank will start to withdraw the old paper fivers as soon as the new ones are circulated. They will remain legal tender until May 2017. Plastic notes are already used in more than 30 countries, including Carney\u2019s native Canada, Australia and Singapore.\u201c As Churchill did, we may have to wait a while for the Americans to join up,\u201d Carney said.</p> <p>The image of Churchill on the new plastic fiver is taken from a portrait captured by Yousuf Karsh in Ottawa, Canada, in December 1941. \u201cThe famous glower of the war-time hero prompted, in this case, by the photographer\u2019s decision to take Churchill\u2019s cigar away from him,\u201d Carney said. </p> <p>Behind the portrait is an image of the Houses of Parliament, featuring the Great Clock on Big Ben with the hands set to 3 o\u2019clock, the approximate time on 13 May 1940 when Churchill made his inaugural speech to the Commons as prime minister. \u201cI have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat,\u201d he said during the speech, a quote that appears beneath his portrait on the note.</p> <p>The Bank has warned the public that brand new polymer notes can stick together \u2013 meaning shoppers could mistakenly hand over two notes instead of one \u2013 but said the effect tends to wear off quickly once in use. They are not completely indestructible, nor are they counterfeit-proof, but illegally copying them should be a slower and more costly process.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_fUKDmI8bU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_fUKDmI8bU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Carney said the plastic notes allowed for better security features than their paper counterparts, including see-through panels, coloured foils, detailed metallic images and tactile features to help visually impaired people recognise different notes. The \u00a310 and \u00a320 notes will have a tactile feature, while the \u00a35 note will be distinguishable by the absence of one.<br></p> <p>The security features on the new plastic fiver include:</p> <ul> <li>A see-through window featuring the Queen\u2019s portrait. The border of the window changes from purple to green.</li> <li>Big Ben shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back.</li> <li>A hologram that contains the word \u201cFive\u201d and changes to \u201cPounds\u201d when the note is tilted.</li> <li>The words \u201cBank of England\u201d printed in raised ink along the top of the note.</li> </ul> <p>The Bank spent around \u00a370m on the research, development and printing of the new banknotes.The plastic cash will be about 15% smaller than paper money, bringing them in line with international sizes. Scotland is expected to introduce its own \u00a35 polymer note in late 2016. Clydesdale Bank launched a limited edition commemorative polymer \u00a35 note in March 2015. Northern Ireland has no plans to replace paper notes, although a commemorative polymer \u00a35 note issued in 2000 is still in circulation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/18/bank-england-plastic-pound-notes-winston-churchill-fiver\">Carney announced the move to plastic notes shortly after he arrived at the Bank in 2013.</a> However, the Bank\u2019s notes division had been considering the switch for years. The move to plastic is the latest in a long line of changes for banknotes, first issued in return for deposits by the Bank, when it was established in 1694, to raise money for William III\u2019s war against France.</p> <p>Coloured \u00a35 notes replaced white ones in the 1950s; the first portrayal of a monarch came in 1960, when the Queen appeared on a new \u00a31 note; and the introduction of historical figures such as William Shakespeare started in the 1970s.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 2 June 2016 as it incorrectly stated the new \u00a35 note was Britain\u2019s first plastic one.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vulture funds that drag developing countries through the courts in order to recover unpaid debts might seem like unlikely allies in the fight against corruption. The US hedge fund Elliott Management recently pocketed $2.28bn (\u00a31.58bn) after winning a 15-year battle with Argentina over long defaulted-bonds, which it had bought cheaply before suing the government for repayment of their full face value plus interest. A leading authority on offshore companies and money laundering believes such aggressive pursuit of profit should be used against corrupt world leaders who plunder state assets. In a new book, Jason Sharman, a professor at the Centre for Governance and Public Policy at Australia\u2019s Griffith University, contends that efforts to combat kleptocracy should become a profit-driven industry because the current system of conventions, treaties, laws and regulations is ineffective. The Despots\u2019 Guide to Wealth Management, published next year, recommends that law firms, venture capitalists and vulture funds should become the primary players in the hunt for looted wealth, even if that means they keep a substantial proportion or all of the recovered assets. This would be preferable to the current system where governments pursue criminal prosecutions against corrupt officials, because such legal action is often unsuccessful or leaves victim countries worse off, writes Sharman. For example, in the aftermath of the Arab uprisings of 2011, the Egyptian government attempted to recover billions of pounds in assets believed to have been stolen by the deposed president Hosni Mubarak. But, Sharman notes, the case was blighted by poor co-operation between British and Egyptian officials, and Cairo spent millions of pounds on the services of a London law firm, Stephenson Harwood, without recovering any funds. Sharman recomends that victim governments cut deals with law firms or venture capitalists to finance asset recovery cases in exchange for up to 50% of the money recouped. \u201cIf it fails it would be tough shit for the venture capitalist and the victim country wouldn\u2019t lose anything,\u201d said Sharman. \u201cIf it succeeded, half of the funds would go the venture capitalist firm, which has been paying the lawyers. Basically it\u2019s turning the profit motive from an enemy of corruption into an ally of that cause.\u201d His book also proposes that vulture funds should be recruited to target kleptocrats, although they would keep all of the recovered money. Sharman points to the way legal action by two subsidiaries of Elliot Management \u2013 founded by the US billionaire and Republican party donor Paul Elliott Singer \u2013 helped to break the secrecy around shell companies, which can be used by corrupt officials and their associates to hide stolen assets. In 2014, NML Capital launched legal action in Nevada to try to uncover the ownership of 123 shell companies it suspected of being controlled by L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a close business associate of Argentina\u2019s former presidents N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. The dispute with the firms\u2019 agent, MF Nevada, not only proved that it was part of Mossack Fonseca, which the Panamanian law firm had denied, but also led to a court order demanding details about any money that had flowed through the Nevada companies. In 2007, Kensington International supplied the human rights group Global Witness with copies of financial documents which revealed that money paid by western firms for Congolese oil went to shell companies controlled by Denis Christel Sassou-Nguesso, son of the president of Congo Brazzaville. Sassou-Nguesso asked the high court in London to order the NGO to remove the documents from its website, but the legal action failed and the judge remarked that the plaintiff was \u201cunsavoury and corrupt\u201d and that the oil profits \u201cshould go to the people of Congo, not those who rule it or their families\u201d. Sharman writes: \u201cIf a vulture fund takes someone corrupt to court and strips them of $100m then it doesn\u2019t make the victim country any richer but it provides some accountability and a deterrent. Other would-be criminals think: well even if I escape my own government, there are these firms that will come after my money no matter where it is in the world.\u201d Other measures suggested by Sharman include extending visa bans on suspected kleptocrats to blacklist entire governments to prevent stolen assets from being hidden overseas, and allowing tax inspectors to prosecute corrupt officials for tax evasion arising from interest earned on their illegal wealth. Rachel Davies, head of UK advocacy and research at Transparency International, said civil legal action should not be a replacement for law enforcement or public prosecution. \u201cThe UN convention against corruption states that the main priority should be to return these funds to the origin state, legitimate owner or victims of the crime, with only reasonable expenses being deducted for the costs of investigations, prosecution or judicial proceedings,\u201d she said. \u201cIn countries, like the UK, that are a target for the proceeds of corruption, law enforcement should be sufficiently resourced to take the lead on cases involving corrupt assets.\u201d Sharman, who will take up a professorship in international relations at Cambridge University later this year, said he would prefer that vulture funds seized ill-gotten wealth than corrupt officials kept it. \u201cI\u2019m less interested in what laws say than what works,\u201d he added. \u201cThe current system has a very poor record of actually returning money to victim countries, especially when you take into account the cost of investigation and legal action, the cost of post-repatriation monitoring and the danger it will be restolen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "1928 A group of American entrepreneurs opens a general store in Brixton with the aim of creating a UK version of Woolworths. Nothing is priced at more than a shilling, although the price bar rises to five shillings the following year as British Home Stores moves into home furnishings. 1933 BHS makes its debut on the London Stock Exchange. 1977 BHS teams up with Sainsbury\u2019s to create SavaCentre hypermarkets, opening the first store in Washington, Tyne and Wear. Sainsbury\u2019s buys out BHS\u2019s 50% share in 1989 and the name eventually disappears from UK high streets. 1982 BHS overhauls its stores, swapping supermarket-style rows for a layout closer to a department store. 1986 BHS merges with Mothercare and Sir Terence Conran\u2019s Habitat to become Storehouse plc. 1989 Facing falling sales across the group, Storehouse reorganises its management, bringing in American retail executive David Dworkin as chairman. About 900 middle management jobs are lost. 1995 BHS opens a branch in Moscow, putting it in the first wave of British retailers selling in the former Soviet Union. BHS\u2019s offering of comfy cardigans and slippers later goes to central Asia, the Middle East, Hong Kong and the Falkland Islands. 1998 BHS opens its first store dedicated to homewares in Bath. 2000 Retail tycoon Philip Green pays \u00a3200m for BHS, taking the retail chain into private hands for the first time in decades. BHS has a pension fund surplus of \u00a35m. 2002 Green buys the Arcadia empire, snapping up brands including Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Burton. 2004 Between 2002 and 2004, the BHS shareholders extract just over \u00a3422m in dividends \u2013 the vast majority of which went to Green\u2019s family. 2005 Green awards himself a record-breaking \u00a31.2bn payout from the Arcadia group. The dividend is paid to his wife, Tina, the legal owner of Arcadia, who resides in Monaco, exempting the Greens from paying tax on the payment. 2006 Green sounds out Asda and Debenhams about buying BHS, as shoppers desert the chain for cheaper rivals, such as Primark, or revitalised department stores. He admits taking his eye off the ball after a failed attempt to buy Marks &amp; Spencer two years earlier. 2009 Green merges BHS into Taveta, controlled by his wife Tina. Taveta also owns Arcadia. The BHS pension deficit soars to nearly \u00a3140m. 2014 BHS opens its first two food-only stores in Staines and Warrington and promises to beat the big four supermarkets by up to 10% on price. 2015 BHS is sold to a group of City lawyers and investors, Retail Acquisitions, for just \u00a31. Darren Topp becomes chief executive, with a brief to turn the business around, including launching new concessions within the stores. By the end of the year the pension fund deficit has reached \u00a3226m. Retail Acquisitions begins talks to raise \u00a370m of funding. 2016 February BHS hires financial firm KPMG to help cut its rent bill on a number of problem stores after poor Christmas trading. March BHS files a company voluntary arrangement, with landlords accepting sharp cuts to the rent on 87 of BHS\u2019s 164 shops. April 22 April: The company warns it still needs to raise \u00a3100m to pay staff wages and rent, and fund its turnaround plan. It is in talks with private equity firm Gordon Brothers over a \u00a360m loan, and with the Pension Protection Fund over a \u00a3571m pensions deficit. 24 April: Weekend rescue talks with Sports Direct fail to come up with an agreement. 25 April: BHS officially collapses into administration. June 2 June: BHS administrator calls in liquidators despite considering several rescue bids, saying a deal could not be agreed because of the significant funding required to save the business.

The company has gone through a structural change by selling its milk business and it reported a 5.8% fall in full year revenues last month. But it said profit margins remained strong at its remaining businesses, despite the competitive pressures from its supermarket customers. Analysts at Investec have just issued a buy note, albeit with a reduced target price, which has helped lift its shares 1.6% to 553p and make it one of the biggest risers in the FTSE 250. Investec said: A year of transition, 2016 saw Dairy Crest shed its liquid milk operations and add higher value ingredients to the business mix. There was little overall profit progress, although we expect better profit growth this year as ingredients make a first contribution. The stock has already re-rated to reflect the upgrade in the quality of profits, ex-dairy, so there is less obvious re-rating upside from here. Our target price suggests 9% upside, but with a 4% yield, this keeps the stock in buy recommendation territory for now. Our new forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are around 4% lower than before, largely reflecting a higher interest cost assumption, with some modest trim to EBIT. This in turn feeds through to a reduced target price of 600p (from 625p).",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s construction firms have recorded their first decline in orders in three years as output slowed further in the run-up to the EU referendum. The purchasing managers\u2019 index for the construction industry from Markit and Cips fell from 52 in April to 51.2 in May, its lowest level since June 2013. A reading above 50 signals expansion. A majority of firms reported falling orders for the first time since April 2013 while output growth slowed to its weakest rate in almost three years. A number of firms said clients were reluctant to place orders and start contracts until after the referendum on 23 June. A third of respondents said their business had been adversely affected by uncertainty surrounding the vote, which is likely to be tight. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cThe construction sector is in the doldrums, confirming that the recovery is faring badly under the strain of Brexit risk. \u201cBut even after a \u2018Bremain\u2019 vote, we doubt that the recovery in the construction sector will race away. The sector\u2019s slowdown has reflected more than just Brexit risk. The official data clearly shows that public sector construction is being squeezed, while the revival in housebuilding has run into skilled labour shortages.\u201d All three areas of construction reported much weaker output growth than at the start of the year. Housebuilding and commercial construction both grew at the weakest rates in about three years. Civil engineering ground to a halt in May and was the worst-performing area for the second month running. Construction companies were relatively upbeat about the growth outlook, although confidence levels were among the lowest seen over the past three years. More than half surveyed expecting to increase their output over the next 12 months, and only 14% anticipating a fall. As a result, hiring picked up and reached a four-month high, marking three years of continuous job creation. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cThe government will be particularly disappointed to see housebuilding growth could only edge up for a third month running in May and is around its lowest levels since early 2013, given that it is looking to address the UK\u2019s acute housing shortage.\u201d A vote to leave would hit the construction sector hard, housebuilders have said, exacerbating skill shortages if the flow of migrant workers into Britain dries up. Two-thirds of the construction sector supports continued EU membership, with more than half saying Brexit would lead to less foreign investment and drive up labour and material costs, according to a survey by Building magazine.",

GlaxoSmithKline however has dipped 3p to 1444.5p despite announcing plans to file a key product for US approval earlier than expected. It said that following discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration, it will seek approval for a three-in-one inhaler for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by the end of 2016. It plans to file for European approval around the same time. Drug companies are seeking new treatments as they face increased competition from generic products as patents expire. Shore Capital analyst Dr Tara Raveendran said: This brings forward the expected submission date in the US to the end of 2016 rather than the first half of 2018 as previously expected and GlaxoSmithKline still expects EU regulatory submission by the end of 2016. The announcement is good news for the company, as its portfolio of new respiratory eases the transition away from Advair, however focus in the near term is likely to remain on Anoro/Incruse/Breo and the novel biologic, anti-IL5 mAb Nucala. Among the risers banks are higher as the prospect of a rise in US interest rates should boost their balance sheets, with Barclays 4.55p better at 184.5p, Standard Chartered up 11.6p at 533.9p and Royal Bank of Scotland rising 4.7p to 244.3p. Oil companies are climbing as crude touches $50 a barrel ahead of the Opec meeting in Vienna, with Royal Dutch Shell B shares up 27.5p at 1691.5p. Johnson Matthey is 39p higher at \u00a328.66 as the technology group gave an upbeat outlook despite a 5% fall in full year profits to \u00a3418.2m, hit by cost cutting and restructuring charges. It said regulatory moves for cleaner vehicles would benefit its catalysts business for emission control devices. It said: [The emission control technologies] division should benefit from continued growth in vehicle production in Asia and Europe, and robust demand for trucks in Western Europe....[It] remains well positioned to benefit from the strong growth opportunities provided by continued tightening of legislation around the world. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 24.06 points at 6215.99. Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, said: It\u2019s all eyes on Vienna Thursday. Both Opec and the ECB meet in the Austrian capital, but neither is expected to announce market-moving news. It\u2019s highly unlikely the Saudis will convince Iran to accept a cartel-wide production ceiling. After years in the wilderness, Tehran is keen to grab market share. European policymakers, meanwhile, have enough on their plate implementing measures agreed in March. At best, there is an outside chance that a surge in the oil price to $50 may trigger a rare upgrade to inflation forecasts. With US data already mixed this week and non-farm payrolls on Friday, one might have expected investors to sit this out. A big jobs number tomorrow will only reignite calls for a rate hike in a fortnight\u2019s time. A number of companies have gone ex-dividend including National Grid, down 40.5p at 965p, and Marks &amp; Spencer, 7.6p lower at 358.7p. Building materials group Wolseley is down another 52p at \u00a337.76 in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s disappointing update. Among the mid-caps Moneysupermarket.com has slumped 7% to 307p after Jefferies cut its recommendation from buy to hold after data from analytics group Hitwise. Jefferies said: The Hitwise data set seems more relevant to Moneysupermarket.com than to some other mobile centric models. The long run shows some meaningful shifts in UK competitive position, with Moneysupermarket.com no longer leading the pack. In the near term, the expected pick up in the second quarter of 2016 seems more muted than we anticipated. We trim numbers and move to hold, price target 312p.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England\u2019s first plastic banknote, the new Winston Churchill fiver, will be unveiled at Blenheim Palace, the wartime leader\u2019s ancestral home, on Thursday. It forms part of the Bank\u2019s switch to polymer banknotes, which will end 320 years of paper money. The Churchill fiver, which goes into circulation in September, will be the first of a series of new plastic notes, followed by the Jane Austen \u00a310 next year and the JMW Turner \u00a320 by 2020. Manufactured from a transparent plastic film and coated with an ink layer, polymer banknotes are seen as cleaner, more durable and more secure than paper. The material allows the inclusion of clear \u201cwindows\u201d to protect against counterfeits. They are also more environmentally friendly than paper because they can last up to two-and-a-half times longer, according to the Bank of England. It claims that the durability will offset the higher production costs and save an estimated \u00a3100m. The Bank\u2019s laboratory tests showed polymer banknotes only begin to shrink and melt at 120C, so they are expected to survive a washing machine spin cycle \u2013 although they could be damaged by a hot iron. The move to polymer notes will land shops and banks with a bill of up to \u00a3236m, it has been estimated, because ATMs, vending machines and self-service machines will need to be recalibrated to take the new plastic notes, which are 15% smaller than the current notes. Some older ATMs will need to be replaced. More than 30 countries already use polymer notes, including New Zealand, Canada, Fiji, Mauritius and Mexico. They were first introduced by Australia, in 1988. The Churchill fiver will replace the current \u00a35 note featuring prison reformer Elizabeth Fry. News in 2013 that she would be replaced with the former prime minister sparked an outcry as it meant that, apart from the Queen, there would be no female figures on British banknotes. A few months later the Bank announced that writer Jane Austen would be the next face of the \u00a310 note. Churchill will be pictured alongside a view of Westminster with Big Ben showing 3 o\u2019clock \u2013 the approximate time on 13 May 1940 when Churchill declared in a speech: \u201cI have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2016. An earlier version said that Winston Churchill will be the first statesman to feature on British banknotes. The Duke of Wellington appeared on \u00a35 notes from 1971 to 1991.",

The research consultancy TNS found that 37% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) favoured Brexit while 38% wanted to stay in the single market. A resounding 68% expected the UK to remain, citing the public\u2019s desire for economic stability and fear of change. One in four SMEs had not decided how to vote and many did not feel well-informed about how leaving the EU would affect their business. Those that had a view often gave personal reasons. Cheap holidays and wine, but also economic stability and free trade were given as reasons for staying. Those wanting to leave cited \u201cBritish values\u201d, restoring independence and controlling immigration. Half of all respondents could not give a clear business reason for both sides of the argument. Big companies overwhelmingly want to stay in the EU and are represented by high-profile bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). SMEs, which make up more than half of UK private sector employment, get less attention. The TNS poll of more than 500 businesses suggests a shift towards leaving the EU since a larger survey in September found 47% in favour of staying and 41% wanting to quit. Amy Cashman, TNS\u2019s UK managing director of financial services and technology, said: \u201cWhile some SME owners are backing Brexit, the high proportion of those predicting that the UK will remain in the EU shows that fear of the unknown is likely to be a deciding factor. The reasons given by SME owners for voting, on both sides of the debate, show that the Brexit debate is influenced by passions and personal preferences.\u201d TNS conducted an online survey of 502 companies with fewer than 250 employees in May.

      "bodyText": "A new secretary general should be elected at an Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) ministerial meeting in Vienna on Thursday but otherwise it is expected to be business \u2013 or rather little business \u2013 as usual. Mohammed Barkindo, a former boss of Nigeria\u2019s national oil company, is in pole position to be installed as front man for the oil cartel, whose lack of internal unity leaves it unable to take decisive action. Among those eligible to vote for him will be another new face at Opec top table, the newly appointed Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih, who showed his intent to take the summit seriously by arriving at the start of the week. But determination to break the sense of drift inside Opec is being undermined by the fact that market forces have driven up the value of benchmark Brent blend to about $50 per barrel. That is still down massively from the $115 seen this time two years ago but more than 80% up on the level seen mid-February, and enough to take some pain away from those Opec countries most exposed to low prices. Some countries whose economies are in crisis due to the prolonged slump in the cost of oil, such as Venezuela, hope a production freeze can be agreed by Opec in an effort to bolster prices. But the laissez-faire consensus more likely to prevail was outlined by Suhail bin Mohammed al-Mazrouei, the energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, who said: \u201cSupply and demand are working and this is the element of this (Opec) policy. From the beginning of the year until now, the market has been correcting itself upward. This is the year of correction.\u201d There has been renewed talk among some Opec members about holding output with Saudi Arabia said to be among those in favour. But a previous attempt to do this at a meeting in April came to nothing because the Saudis refused to support the plan because Iran refused to cooperate. Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in a regional political rivalry that has spilled out into Opec. And Tehran said its position remained unchanged. \u201cIran supports Opec\u2019s efforts to bring stability to the market with fair and logical prices, but it will not commit to any output freeze,\u201d Mehdi Asali , the country\u2019s Opec representative said in an interview with the Iranian oil ministry news agency, Shana. There is increasing hopes in some quarters that the price of oil has bottomed out and should be well on its way to $60 in the second half of the year. The normally bearish analysts at Goldman Sachs have recently been much more upbeat about prospects for the costs of crude to increase. But others warn that the spike since February has largely been driven by supply outages due to renewed militant action against pipelines in Nigeria and bushfires in Canada. As output gradually returns to normal there and production growth occurs in places such as Iran and Iraq, the price of oil will again begin to ratchet downwards given the sluggish state of demand due to a stagnant world economy, say the pessimists. Low oil prices are bad for producing countries but good for major importers such as China. Britain loses North Sea activity but gains from lower petrol and other fuel costs. Bjarne Schieldrop, the chief commodities analyst at the Nordic bank SEB, warned that the violent crude oil price moves experienced since mid-2014 could become the rule rather than the exception, not just down, but also up. \u201cThe Opec meeting tomorrow is not attracting much attention as no cuts or freezes are anticipated and we don\u2019t expect any agreements on production limiting measures,\u201d he said. \u201cIncreasingly however, we think that the market must also start to realise that Opec will no longer hold much reserve capacity in order to increase production during periods of deficit. We may have disliked Opec\u2019s action and managed interference in the oil market, however, we might end up missing it next time it goes wrong, possibly then to the upside.\u201d",
