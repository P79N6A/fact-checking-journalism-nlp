      "bodyText": "The TUC has urged the government to use productivity gains from the greater use of robots and artificial intelligence to reverse planned changes to the state pension age. Before its annual congress in Brighton, the TUC said higher levels of productivity thanks to technological innovation ought to bring greater benefits for working people. It said recent progress had mainly benefited business owners, rather than being shared across the workforce through better wages and working conditions. Analysis from the accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests GDP could receive a 10% boost from productivity gains linked to artificial intelligence by 2030, helping to bolster the British economy as it seeks to escape a period of weak output growth. That could relieve the pressure on workers to stay in employment into their late 60s, according to the TUC. Analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Department for Work and Pensions estimates that for each year the state retirement age is raised, 0.3% of GDP is saved in state pension expenditure, and 1% more GDP is generated from the extra labour. The government announced in July that it would increase the state pension age from 67 to 68 between 2037 and 2039. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: \u201cRobots and AI could let us produce more for less, boosting national prosperity. But we need a debate about who benefits from this wealth, and how workers get a fair share.\u201d There have been previous waves of technological advance since the first Industrial Revolution, when inefficient jobs have been replaced by machines or the number of people required to do work has been reduced. Such advances have not led to an overall loss of jobs, but have disrupted the type of work people do. There are concerns that the current phase of innovation could be more damaging, while the rewards from higher productivity have not necessarily translated into higher wages. The latest available figures show low levels of unemployment unseen since the mid-1970s, but growth in real wages remains negative as inflation outstrips a sluggish earnings growth. In 1950, almost one in three workers worked in manufacturing, while one in 12 worked in professional and technical services. By 2016 the proportions had reversed, according to the TUC, but it found the jobs lost in manufacturing were not replaced by jobs of similar or better quality in the communities affected. It said wages in former industrial areas were still 10% below the national average. The increase in the state pension age, which was controversially brought forward by seven years by the work and pensions secretary, David Gauke, is expected to affect about 7 million people in their late 30s and early 40s. As well as reversing the move on the pension age, the TUC said workers should be given the right to a midlife career review, while firms should invest more in workplace training. At present, the UK invests just half of the EU average, it said. O\u2019Grady said: \u201cRobots are not just terminators. Some of today\u2019s jobs will not survive, but new jobs will be created. We must make sure that tomorrow\u2019s jobs are no worse than today\u2019s.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "HSBC has rushed to head off complaints from small businesses that found the bank had frozen or closed down their accounts as part of a crackdown on financial crime. Hundreds of small firms are thought to be affected, whose businesses range from an avocado importer to marketing and design companies. Britain\u2019s biggest bank, which has faced accusations of reacting slowly to the debacle, said that after becoming aware of problems in the past week, it was putting extra staff on its helpline and speeding up the process for dealing with complaints. It said staff were reducing the amount of time to unfreeze an account once a review had been completed. It stressed that business customers were sent several letters asking for information on their dealings with overseas suppliers over a three-month period, asking customers to make an appointment via the telephone or in a branch. A spokesman said problems occurred when customers failed to respond, responded late or provided partial information. A number of small firms claimed their accounts were suspended without prior notification. Calan Horsman, whose company Loogun makes a hand-held water gun for toilet cleaning, said he was left with stock stuck in China, in default to suppliers and was unable to pay staff after the business account was frozen. He said he sent 60 emails to various people at HSBC and spent 18 hours on the phone. He eventually managed to close the account and transferred the funds to another bank. Horsman said the company lost a month in its production schedule as a result \u2013 which means a new product that was due to launch before Christmas has been delayed into the new year. \u201cIt means we\u2019ve missed the entire festive period.\u201d He was told by HSBC that he had provided incomplete information and the bank \u201capparently left a voice message but because I didn\u2019t respond, they suspended our account 24 hours later\u201d. He believes that the issue was a shareholder deposit the firm had received as part of a funding round that was judged to be unconnected with his business. HSBC said: \u201cAs part of our efforts to stop financial crime, we are conducting detailed \u2018KYC\u2019 reviews in which we ask customers to provide information about themselves and their businesses. We allow several months for this process because we may need to speak to customers multiple times to acquire additional data and to clarify what they\u2019ve told us. \u201cWe apologise for the inconvenience this causes, but urge customers to respond to our requests as promptly and comprehensively as possible. If we don\u2019t receive all the information we need we may be forced to restrict services or, as a last resort, to close an account. We want to work with customers to ensure we don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d Kelly Molson, co-founder of design agency Rubber Cheese, tweeted in August: \u201c14.5 years as a @HSBC_UK business customer, I\u2019m utterly disgusted at the way we\u2019ve been treated. No notification of account suspension.\u201d and \u201cNo timeframe for lifting suspension. I can\u2019t make payments, card payments are being blocked.

      "bodyText": "His charitable donations have been described as some of the most generous ever made in the UK, but unease about Sir Leonard Blavatnik\u2019s philanthropy has grown after a leading political academic quit the University of Oxford. The Ukraine-born billionaire gave \u00a375m to Oxford to set up the Blavatnik school of government, one of the largest donations in the history of the university. But last week Bo Rothstein resigned as a professor of government and public policy at the institution after it emerged that Blavatnik had donated $1m (\u00a3773,000) to Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration committee. A spokesperson for Blavatnik said his gift was for the committee that has been responsible for organising US presidential inaugurations since 1901 and that he had never donated to Trump. But Rothstein, a specialist on corruption, called the donation \u201cincomprehensible and irresponsible\u201d in his resignation letter. The academic subsequently told the Guardian he had received hundreds of messages of support about his decision, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the Blavatnik chair of government and public policy because I\u2019m not going to give legitimacy and credibility to this person. $1m is a sizeable amount of money. In my book by donating to the inauguration of Donald Trump you are supporting Donald Trump.\u201d Blavatnik, a UK and US citizen, was knighted for his philanthropy this year. His links to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and controversy in his business background mean criticism has often followed his donations, especially when it involves institutions naming buildings after him. Oxford is not the only institution that has accepted money from Blavatnik and in return put his name on something. Tate Modern named its new extension after him because he made a donation the gallery described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d. The V&amp;A museum is to call its new entrance hall after him too. Oxford had already been criticised for accepting Blavatnik\u2019s money before the letter from Rothstein. Two years ago, a collection of critics issued an open letter about his donation to the university, urging it to \u201cstop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin\u2019s associates\u201d. The signatories included Pavel Litvinov, one of the eight 1968 Red Square protesters, and Vladimir Bukovsky, a Russian dissident who exposed the Kremlin\u2019s use of psychiatric treatment on political prisoners. The letter urged Oxford to look into Blavatnik\u2019s role in a clash between the British oil firm BP and its partners in a Russian venture. Blavatnik, who turned 60 in June, was one of a group of oligarchs in the AAR consortium which partnered BP to create TNK-BP, one of the largest oil companies in Russia. Blavatnik was a director of TNK-BP. One of the As in the consortium stands for Access Industries, the company Blavatnik founded in 1986 two years after becoming a US, and which he still uses to make investments today. After being born in Odessa, Ukraine, he attended the Moscow state university of railway engineering before his family emigrated to the US in 1978. He obtained a master\u2019s and an MBA from Columbia and Harvard universities respectively. Access began making investments in Russia after the fall of communism as the energy and aluminium groups of the former Soviet Union were broken up. Eventually Blavatnik combined assets with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman to form AAR. Their partnership with BP ended in acrimony. In 2008, Bob Dudley, then the chief executive of TNK-BP and now the boss of BP, left Moscow after what the British company described as an \u201corchestrated campaign of harassment\u201d. Armed police also raised TNK-BPs office and more than 100 BP managers had to leave Russia after the authorities refused to renew their visas. US diplomats alleged that at least one individual in AAR, German Khan, was involved in a state-sponsored campaign against BP to try to force them out of Russia. However, AAR and lawyers for Blavatnik have denied any involvement, including that of Khan, in a plot against BP. In the end, both BP and AAR were bought out of the venture by state-backed Russian energy company Rosneft. The $55bn (\u00a342bn) deal in 2013 handed the oligarchs, including Blavatnik, $28bn. It was signed off at a meeting with Putin. The cash from the sale of TNK-BP pushed him to the top spot of the Sunday Times rich list in 2015. By this stage Access had already diversified beyond Russia and the energy sector. Blavatnik became of one the most powerful men in the music industry when he bought Warner Music for $3.3bn in 2011. Two years later Warner bought Parlophone, adding David Bowie and Coldplay to its catalogue of artists. Blavatnik is now a regular at major music events and Ed Sheeran, who is signed to Warner, played at his daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah. Blavatnik first started attracting headlines in the UK in 2004 when he paid \u00a340m to buy a property in Kensington Palace Gardens in London. After substantial work on the house it is now estimated to be worth \u00a3200m. Previous reporting about Blavatnik, who becaame a UK citizen in 2010, suggests he is keen to address preconceptions about him and protect his reputation. With this is mind, Rothstein\u2019s resignation from Oxford and the fallout are likely to be uncomfortable for Blavatnik. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 11 September 2017 to remove a reference to Sir Leonard Blavatnik being a \u201cPutin pal\u201d. We have apologised to Sir Leonard Blavatnik for describing him as a \u201cPutin pal\u201d and the full text of the apology can be found here. Further, Sir Leonard Blavatnik\u2019s lawyers have informed the Guardian that the term \u201coligarch\u201d in his view does not apply to him. The Guardian editor-in-chief disagrees.",

But Rothstein, a specialist on corruption, called the donation \u201cincomprehensible and irresponsible\u201d in his resignation letter.</p> <p>The academic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/aug/29/oxford-professor-in-trump-donation-row-defends-resignation\">subsequently told the Guardian he had received hundreds of messages of support about his decision</a>, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the Blavatnik chair of government and public policy because I\u2019m not going to give legitimacy and credibility to this person. $1m is a sizeable amount of money. In my book by donating to the inauguration of Donald Trump you are supporting Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Blavatnik, a UK and US citizen, was knighted for his philanthropy this year. His links to Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia and controversy in his business background mean criticism has often followed his donations, especially when it involves institutions naming buildings after him.</p> <p>Oxford is not the only institution that has accepted money from Blavatnik and in return put his name on something. Tate Modern named its new extension after him because he made a donation the gallery described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d. The V&amp;A museum is to call its new entrance hall after him too.</p> <p>Oxford had already been criticised for accepting Blavatnik\u2019s money before the letter from Rothstein. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/03/oxford-university-accused-over-oligarch-len-blavatnik-75m-donation\">Two years ago, a collection of critics issued an open letter about his donation to the university</a>, urging it to \u201cstop selling its reputation and prestige to Putin\u2019s associates\u201d.</p> <p>The signatories included Pavel Litvinov, one of the eight 1968 Red Square protesters, and Vladimir Bukovsky, a Russian dissident who exposed the Kremlin\u2019s use of psychiatric treatment on political prisoners.</p> <p>The letter urged Oxford to look into Blavatnik\u2019s role in a clash between the British oil firm BP and its partners in a Russian venture.</p> <p>Blavatnik, who turned 60 in June, was one of a group of oligarchs in the AAR consortium which partnered BP to create TNK-BP, one of the largest oil companies in Russia. Blavatnik was a director of TNK-BP. </p> <p>One of the As in the consortium stands for Access Industries, the company Blavatnik founded in 1986 two years after becoming a US, and which he still uses to make investments today.</p> <p>After being born in Odessa, Ukraine, he attended the Moscow state university of railway engineering before his family emigrated to the US in 1978. He obtained a master\u2019s and an MBA from Columbia and Harvard universities respectively.</p> <p>Access began making investments in Russia after the fall of communism as the energy and aluminium groups of the former Soviet Union were broken up. Eventually Blavatnik combined assets with Viktor Vekselberg and Mikhail Fridman to form AAR. Their partnership with BP ended in acrimony.</p> <p>In 2008, Bob Dudley, then the chief executive of TNK-BP and now the boss of BP, left Moscow after what the British company described as an \u201corchestrated campaign of harassment\u201d. Armed police also raised TNK-BPs office and more than 100 BP managers had to leave Russia after the authorities refused to renew their visas.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/25/bp.oil\">US diplomats alleged that at least one individual in AAR, German Khan, was involved</a> in a state-sponsored campaign against BP to try to force them out of Russia. However, AAR and lawyers for Blavatnik have denied any involvement, including that of Khan, in a plot against BP.</p> <p>In the end, both BP and AAR were bought out of the venture by state-backed Russian energy company Rosneft. The $55bn (\u00a342bn) deal in 2013 handed the oligarchs, including Blavatnik, $28bn. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/21/rosneft-takes-over-tnk-bp\">signed off at a meeting with Putin.</a></p> <p>The cash from the sale of TNK-BP pushed him to the top spot of the Sunday Times rich list in 2015. By this stage Access had already diversified beyond Russia and the energy sector. </p> <p>Blavatnik became of one the most powerful men in the music industry when he bought Warner Music for $3.3bn in 2011. Two years later Warner bought Parlophone, adding David Bowie and Coldplay to its catalogue of artists. Blavatnik is now a regular at major music events and Ed Sheeran, who is signed to Warner, played at his daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah.</p> <p>Blavatnik first started attracting headlines in the UK in 2004 when he paid \u00a340m to buy a property in Kensington Palace Gardens in London. After substantial work on the house it is now estimated to be worth \u00a3200m. </p> <p>Previous reporting about Blavatnik, who becaame a UK citizen in 2010, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/03/oxford-university-accused-over-oligarch-len-blavatnik-75m-donation\">suggests he is keen to address preconceptions about him and protect his reputation</a>.</p> <p>With this is mind, Rothstein\u2019s resignation from Oxford and the fallout are likely to be uncomfortable for Blavatnik.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 11 September 2017 to remove a reference to Sir Leonard Blavatnik being a \u201cPutin pal\u201d. We have apologised to Sir Leonard Blavatnik for describing him as a \u201cPutin pal\u201d and the full text of the apology can be found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/sep/26/corrections-and-clarifications\">here</a>. Further, Sir Leonard Blavatnik\u2019s lawyers have informed the Guardian that the term \u201coligarch\u201d in his view does not apply to him. The Guardian editor-in-chief disagrees.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A grey metal box in the North Wales countryside is home to the jewel of Britain\u2019s aerospace industry. Airbus\u2019s factory in Broughton, Flintshire, is where the pan-European aerospace and defence group manufactures all the wings for its commercial aircraft. The well-paid jobs, cutting-edge technology and headline-grabbing products are highly prized \u2013 by Britain, and by other Airbus factories around Europe. Airbus has long fought off green-eyed advances from its plants in Toulouse, Hamburg and elsewhere, which are keen to wrest wing production from Britain\u2019s clutches. But there are concerns that the vote to leave the European Union has weakened Britain\u2019s grip on this precious gem. High-tech manufacturers such as Dyson have dismissed concerns that extra tariffs and possible delays at borders after Brexit will hinder trade. That may be true for independent businesses but less so for foreign-owned companies that are part of supply chains across the EU, from the car industry to pharmaceuticals, plastics and, crucially, aerospace where politics plays such an important role. Britain has maintained its slice of the Airbus pie as long as it has been a large net contributor to the EU budget. Without that leverage, there must be a question mark over future investment. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of ADS, the trade body for the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, said: \u201cWe are concerned that there could be a long-term erosion of Britain\u2019s competitiveness and that big projects will not be allocated to the UK. We are currently a big player in the aerospace industry.\u201d Everitt is not alone. Senior Airbus executives have warned that erecting barriers to the free movement of parts and people across its European sites may cause lasting damage to Britain\u2019s aerospace industry. Airbus spends about \u00a34bn a year with suppliers in the UK \u2013 a significant contribution to Britain\u2019s aerospace industry, which supports about 110,000 high-value, highly skilled jobs. The group employs 15,000 people directly in the UK. About 4,000 of these design the wings for Airbus planes at Filton, Bristol; a further 6,000 workers build more than 1,000 wings each year at Broughton. The Welsh factory is where aviation classics, such as De Havilland\u2019s Comet and Mosquito, were produced. These days, it is responsible for assembling the wings for all Airbus civil aircraft, including the new-generation A350 XWB (extra wide body). The enormous plant receives millions of components each year from other Airbus factories and suppliers around Europe. Once the wings are built, these complex, giant structures are delivered to final assembly lines in various ways, including by road and on the Airbus Beluga super transporter aircraft. Wings for the A380 are sent by road and sea for final aircraft assembly in Toulouse. At present, there are no restrictions or tariffs on the movement of these parts or on the people who oversee this fiendishly complicated jigsaw. Everitt noted: \u201cAs an industry, we run a complex set of manufacturing processes in which millions of components need to pitch up from Toulouse at the right time and in the right order. [Brexit] implies significant cost \u2026 The concern is that the UK becomes less competitive because there are extra costs with moving people and components around.\u201d He noted that aerospace was a capital-intensive, long-cycle industry, so there were unlikely to be dramatic changes on day one of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Last month, Katherine Bennett, the head of Airbus UK, wrote in Bristol\u2019s Western Daily Press: \u201cWe can\u2019t shy away from the fact that future investments made by Airbus will inevitably depend on the economic environment in which we operate. The company\u2019s business model is based on our ability to move products, people and ideas around Europe free from restrictions.\u201d Bennett\u2019s comment hints at the internal dialogue at Airbus \u2013 that Brexit may hand a crucial advantage to sites in Toulouse and Hamburg, which want to grab future wing work from Britain. Even before the vote to leave the EU, well-placed sources said there was constant lobbying from the French and Germans to prise wing manufacturing away from Britain. A senior industry source said: \u201cIt\u2019s a constant and transparent pressure. They have always argued for that work. The next plane that comes out, I would be very surprised if the UK got much work on it. The numbers will be difficult for the UK [because of Brexit]. The question asked will be \u2018why should [new aircraft projects] come to the UK?\u2019\u201d What about the expertise of the engineers at Filton and Broughton? The source reckons 10% of the commercial aviation workforce \u2013 about 1,000 key engineers [800 at Filton and just 200 at Broughton] \u2013 \u201cmake the difference\u201d. \u201cEverything else is a commodity; everything else is up for grabs,\u201d he said. \u201cFor future products, as the business grows, the company will have to progressively globalise its business. I think they will offer what they do in the UK, which is cutting-edge wing design, to other companies for them to manufacture.\u201d A Brexit-inspired shift in wing production would not only be a huge blow to Broughton, it would be likely to trigger an exodus of suppliers. Worryingly, GKN, an engineering group that supplies the aerospace industry, last month said it would be forced to follow Airbus if it shuffled work from Britain to other sites in Europe. Kevin Cummings, chief executive of GKN\u2019s aerospace business, said the FTSE 100 engineering group would have to move its emphasis to where its customers were. \u201cWe are also just as much European as we are a UK company,\u201d Cummings added. Despite this, insiders reckon the Broughton plant should be secure for another 20 years, because it produces wings for the bestselling short-haul A320 and the mid-range A350 aircraft. But there is a growing acknowledgement that new models could be built elsewhere, unless Brexit can deliver \u201cfrictionless trade\u201d. Another source with knowledge of Airbus said: \u201cAirbus is looking to make big decisions over the next two to five years. So the government needs to do what it did for the A320 and chuck in a big sum of money [to secure work for the next model].\u201d If the competitiveness of British sites is threatened, there is likely to be a long-term detrimental effect on Airbus\u2019s future in the UK. \u201cA rejection of the EU by the UK is perceived by many people in Airbus as a rejection of the values that underpin Airbus,\u201d said the source. \u201cIt would be foolish for Airbus to take work out and shut Broughton. But it doesn\u2019t want to give the Europeans an excuse to marginalise the UK, and Brexit gives them an excuse.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When David Cameron set out to create a \u201ctwo-speed Europe\u201d , the former prime minister did so with the words of the Eurosceptic Tory right ringing in his ears. Europe was doomed. Mounting problems for Greece and rising numbers of immigrants showed that Britain must cut itself free from a failing union. Far from prospering from our membership of the world\u2019s largest economy, the EU was hindering mighty Britannia. Take back control. Let Brussels sink. \u201cWe\u2019ve shackled ourselves to a corpse,\u201d said Douglas Carswell in the days before he abandoned the Tory whip to join Ukip. \u201cWe pay for the privilege of being members of this poverty-producing club.\u201d How the tables have turned. Britain now appears stuck in the slow lane of a different kind of two-speed Europe. The UK economy has made its slowest start to a year since 2012, while the eurozone grows twice as fast. The former grew by a tepid 0.3% in the three months to June, while the the latter expanded at a much healthier 0.6%. The UK economy grew at an annualised rate of 1% in the first six months, less than half the average growth rate of about 2.5% in the years running up to the EU referendum. It\u2019s a better picture than the fire, brimstone and oblivion George Osborne forecast ahead of the Brexit vote, but Britain isn\u2019t keeping pace with the corpse it\u2019s unshackling itself from. The reason for the changed landscape? Brexit and the economic uncertainty it unleashed, according to David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. \u201cBritain is fast become the sick man of Europe,\u201d he wrote in the Guardian last month. Looking a little closer, sterling tells the story of our parting of ways. The pound has fallen to its lowest levels in eight years as the UK economy sputters, but it\u2019s also falling because the euro is gaining ground - part of a broad recovery under way since 2014. British holidaymakers buying currency at some UK airports have been offered as little as \u20ac0.86 to the pound in recent weeks. A pound is currently worth \u20ac1.09 on the money markets, down from \u20ac1.31 before the Brexit referendum, and some economists expect it to reach parity. It\u2019s at home, however, that sterling\u2019s fall in value has had its most deleterious effect on the economy. The slump boosted inflation to 2.6% in July and the Bank of England expects the cost of living to rise further, forecasting an increase in the consumer price index to 3% by next month. Higher prices are putting pressure on household spending, a key driver in the UK economy. The impact from the pound\u2019s fall of more than 16% since the referendum has fed through into higher prices for imported goods, which in turn has pushed up prices on the high street. Consumers are tightening their belts as costs increase while wages aren\u2019t going up anywhere near as fast. Earnings increased at a rate of 2.1% in June, failing to match the rate of inflation and meaning a 0.5% drop in real income. As a consequence, spending is growing at its weakest rate in almost three years. It was only shopping in supermarkets that kept retail sales growing in July as other retailers\u2019 business fell off. Rail fares are set to rise by 3.6% next year, compounding the pain. On the plus side, unemployment is at levels unseen since the mid 1970s. That could help increase workers\u2019 bargaining power in seeking higher pay, but it has yet to push up earnings significantly. There are also signs that inflation could be coming close to its peak, after failing to rise as much as expected in July. There is hope the drop in sterling can make Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector more competitive as our products become cheaper for foreign buyers, but manufacturing only accounts for 10% of the UK economy and there are few signs the boost has been commensurate with the drop in the value of sterling. Put simply, the manufacturing sector should be doing even better than it is, given the weak pound. Contrast the picture with Europe, where production is racing ahead. The most recent eurozone purchasing managers\u2019 index, a key barometer of economic activity, came in better than its equivalent measure in the UK for the fourth straight month in July. Economic confidence is at its highest level in a decade. The European commission\u2019s measure of economic sentiment increased to 111.9 in August, its highest level since July 2007, just before the financial crisis hit. Nor are measures of business optimism in the UK keeping pace with Europe. Results of a survey of company executives show their confidence about future production growth remains at the average levels seen over the past five years. The consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said this suggests firms will only invest cautiously in extra capacity. The latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics show this to be the case in the three months to June, when business investment contributed nothing to economic growth. That indicates that firms are standing on the sidelines, fearing that spending now might be wasted should the economy fall off a cliff in the not-to-distant future. Who could blame them given the cloudy political picture? The TUC has called for the government to leave single market membership on the table to give businesses confidence to invest, a position that Labour, has now adopted. The party with the most socialist agenda in a generation now also has the most business friendly one too. Despite the recent sluggish performance of the economy, City economists expect an improvement in the second half of the year. That could help steady ministers\u2019 nerves as they negotiate Britain\u2019s divorce in Brussels, but if isolation from Europe crystallises in the event ministers fail to reach a deal, there is gathering evidence the UK economy will suffer while our biggest trading partner carries on unharmed. UK exports to the EU were worth \u00a3241bn in 2016, and accounted for 44% of all of the country\u2019s exports. British imports from the EU were worth \u00a3312bnand accounted for 53% of all imports. Cameron failed to build his vision of a two-speed Europe, in which Britain remained inside the EU, but on the edge of a eurozone binding itself ever closer. Theresa May is finding it harder still to deliver Brexit. What form it will take is still up for grabs, with the Tory party riven by infighting and the government having a wafer-thin majority. Without clarity and progress, the economy suffers. Far from leaving a Europein its death throes, Britain is struggling under the weight of the Brexit vote, shackled to its damaging consequences.",

      "bodyText": "Brexiters may not have been turkeys voting for a self-basting Christmas, but they could end up as flightless birds. That is the warning from Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, who sees the clock ticking down towards March 2019 with no further progress on any Brexit deal, let alone a separate discussion of the unique demands of the aviation industry. Further inertia risks leaving airlines in limbo, with millions of seats to sell on their planes and potentially no legal right to fly them over the Channel. O\u2019Leary has not always endeared himself to the public, and it would be difficult to imagine a sudden concern for the British people trumping the narrow business interest of his airline. Of course, the economic future of both is aligned, with the UK providing the largest national market for Dublin-based Ryanair, even though O\u2019Leary will find himself with significantly more room to manoeuvre than his British passengers should Brexit spell the worst. Nonetheless, there are good reasons why we should pay attention to his blunt speaking now. Ryanair has long negotiated deals with airports, cities and governments in virtually every country in Europe, and has frequently rubbed up against EU legislation. It is no fan of the European commission, the executive arm of Brussels, but it is still fully cognisant of the worth of Europe. As an Irish airline that will remain European after 2019, it is uniquely placed as storm clouds gather. Ryanair is never shy of talking down a competitor\u2019s prospects, but its business could survive a Brexit scenario that potentially strips rights from British carriers \u2013 even if a hiatus on flights across the Channel would be deeply unwelcome for its profits. While IAG and easyJet publicly insist their own structures are robust enough to deal with Brexit, neither would be likely to advertise fears that the companies might not be able to continue in their current form. A Brexit lobbying paper that came to light last week again makes clear how wishful the thinking of Britain\u2019s ministers and industrialists has been, at least in public. While free, unfettered access for airlines between the UK and Europe might indeed be beneficial to consumers on both sides, the referendum has opened up the possibility of a competitive advantage for players in France and Germany. They are demanding that cabotage rights \u2013 which allows airlines to operate within other EU countries \u2013 be stripped from British-owned carriers that operate links throughout Europe. The reciprocal sanction \u2013 to ban access to British domestic routes for European carriers \u2013 would affect virtually no one. Once again, negotiators will need to grapple with the broader reality of the EU27\u2019s interests versus the fate of one divided island. For O\u2019Leary, the British political elite appears \u201cdelusional\u201d. A less plain-spoken verdict, but equally damning in its diplomatic register, emanated from Brussels the same day: Britain\u2019s approach was nostalgic, unrealistic, untrustworthy. The progress of negotiations suggests O\u2019Leary has, sadly, been proved right in his pre-referendum warnings about how detrimental a Leave vote would be, in his sector at least. To cling on to the rights British airlines enjoy is likely to spell the opposite of taking back control; instead, access to the short-haul European market, which still accounts for most UK flights, will be granted without the power to shape the institutions that run it. The worst-case scenario remains unlikely, as O\u2019Leary concedes, but he still paints a chilling picture that should focus ministers\u2019 minds \u2013 at least if they are seriously pursuing the timetable created by triggering article 50. No industry welcomes the current uncertainty. But while the public may become inured to the gradual shrinking of a chocolate bar, or the trickling away of professionals to the EU, a grounding of holiday flights could provide a vivid demonstration of the troubles ahead. Given that bookings could be pulled months before Britain actually exits its treaties and obligations, Boeing 737s could be the canaries of a hard Brexit. Green bonds can bridge gap between profit and clean tech Can capital markets prevent climate change? It is a crucial question that has flummoxed politicians ever since the Kyoto protocol advocated putting a price on carbon emissions to limit their growth. And it is timely when most scientists agree that hurricanes like Harvey have cause more devastation than they would without the added ingredient of manmade emissions. Twenty years after Kyoto there are still efforts to create markets for carbon. Governments, the World Bank and supranational bodies such as the European Union have strived to make these projects work. Yet the ineptitude and corruption that has dogged carbon markets has probably allowed more carbon to be created. Carbon credit markets allow low emitters to sell their spare credits to heavy polluters. The high cost of the credits should persuade the worst offenders that investment in new technology is a better route to high profits than submitting to ever-more expensive carbon credits. Except that carbon credits are cheap and a succession of revamps has failed to make them scarce enough to encourage environmentally friendly behaviour. Most experts agree that a price above \u20ac40 a tonne is necessary to encourage a switch to lower-carbon power generation. Last year it fell to $5 a tonne, is currently just below $6 and is not expected to reach $30 until 2030. The conclusion must be that all the intellectual capacity expended on a capitalist solution to climate change following Kyoto achieved no gain. Worse, it would appear that without carbon credits to shield corporate polluters, politicians would have come under pressure to devise a better system based on regulation. The City has an answer in the shape of green bonds aimed companies investing in green technology or climate friendly activities. The market in green bonds is young, but it could develop into one of the main sources of funding for \u201cgood\u201d businesses. What to do about the legacy of polluters? That will prove more difficult. Sports Direct chairman must fight own corner Mike Ashley tends to eschew City conventions \u2013 and next week will be no different. The Sports Direct founder and chief executive will not be attending his company\u2019s annual general meeting, as he avoids a repeat of last year\u2019s mild farce, when he took journalists on a guided tour of his Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire. It was a chastening experience, but at least it showed some accountability in the face of pressure from shareholders, politicians and trade unions to reform his business. This year, however, his chairman, Keith Hellawell, will be left to take the flak alone. A trio of powerful City investors are expected to vote against Hellawell\u2019s re-election but Ashley will not be there to defend him \u2013 even if he votes his stake, which is more than 60% of the business, in Hellawell\u2019s favour. So the chairman will be the lightning rod while the only executive who can enact real change at the company \u2013 Ashley, of course \u2013 stays away.",

      "body": "<p>Brexiters may not have been turkeys voting for a self-basting Christmas, but they could end up as flightless birds. That is the warning from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/31/ryanair-may-brexit-deal-michael-oleary-uk-europe\" title=\"\">Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary</a>, who sees the clock ticking down towards March 2019 with no further progress on any Brexit deal, let alone a separate discussion of the unique demands of the aviation industry. Further inertia risks leaving airlines in limbo, with millions of seats to sell on their planes and potentially no legal right to fly them over the Channel.</p> <p>O\u2019Leary has not always endeared himself to the public, and it would be difficult to imagine a sudden concern for the British people trumping the narrow business interest of his airline. Of course, the economic future of both is aligned, with the UK providing the largest national market for Dublin-based Ryanair, even though O\u2019Leary will find himself with significantly more room to manoeuvre than his British passengers should Brexit spell the worst. Nonetheless, there are good reasons why we should pay attention to his blunt speaking now.</p> <p>Ryanair has long negotiated deals with airports, cities and governments in virtually every country in Europe, and has frequently rubbed up against EU legislation. It is no fan of the European commission, the executive arm of Brussels, but it is still fully cognisant of the worth of Europe.</p> <p>As an Irish airline that will remain European after 2019, it is uniquely placed as storm clouds gather. Ryanair is never shy of talking down a competitor\u2019s prospects, but its business could survive a Brexit scenario that potentially strips rights from British carriers \u2013 even if a hiatus on flights across the Channel would be deeply unwelcome for its profits. While IAG and easyJet publicly insist their own structures are robust enough to deal with Brexit, neither would be likely to advertise fears that the companies might not be able to continue in their current form.</p> <p>A Brexit lobbying paper that came to light last week again makes clear how wishful the thinking of Britain\u2019s ministers and industrialists has been, at least in public. While free, unfettered access for airlines between the UK and Europe might indeed be beneficial to consumers on both sides, the referendum has opened up the possibility of a competitive advantage for players in France and Germany.</p> <p>They are demanding that cabotage rights \u2013 which allows airlines to operate within other EU countries \u2013 be stripped from British-owned carriers that operate links throughout Europe. The reciprocal sanction \u2013 to ban access to British domestic routes for European carriers \u2013 would affect virtually no one. Once again, negotiators will need to grapple with the broader reality of the EU27\u2019s interests versus the fate of one divided island.</p> <p>For O\u2019Leary, the British political elite appears \u201cdelusional\u201d. A less plain-spoken verdict, but equally damning in its diplomatic register, emanated from Brussels the same day: Britain\u2019s approach was nostalgic, unrealistic, untrustworthy.</p> <p>The progress of negotiations suggests O\u2019Leary has, sadly, been proved right in his pre-referendum warnings about how detrimental a Leave vote would be, in his sector at least. To cling on to the rights British airlines enjoy is likely to spell the opposite of taking back control; instead, access to the short-haul European market, which still accounts for most UK flights, will be granted without the power to shape the institutions that run it.</p> <p>The worst-case scenario remains unlikely, as O\u2019Leary concedes, but he still paints a chilling picture that should focus ministers\u2019 minds \u2013 at least if they are seriously pursuing the timetable created by triggering article 50. No industry welcomes the current uncertainty. But while the public may become inured to the gradual shrinking of a chocolate bar, or the trickling away of professionals to the EU, a grounding of holiday flights could&#xa0;provide a vivid demonstration of the troubles ahead.</p> <p>Given that bookings could be pulled months before Britain actually exits its treaties and obligations, Boeing 737s could be the canaries of a hard Brexit.</p> <h2>Green bonds can bridge gap between profit and clean tech</h2> <p>Can capital markets prevent climate change? It is a crucial question that has flummoxed politicians ever since the Kyoto protocol advocated putting a price on carbon emissions to limit their growth.</p> <p>And it is timely when most scientists agree that hurricanes like Harvey have cause more devastation than they would without the added ingredient of manmade emissions.</p> <p>Twenty years after Kyoto there are still efforts to create markets for carbon. Governments, the World Bank and supranational bodies such as the European Union have strived to make these projects work. Yet the ineptitude and corruption that has dogged carbon markets has probably allowed more carbon to be created.</p> <p>Carbon credit markets allow low emitters to sell their spare credits to heavy polluters. The high cost of the credits should persuade the worst offenders that investment in new technology is a better route to high profits than submitting to ever-more expensive carbon credits.</p> <p>Except that carbon credits are cheap and a succession of revamps has failed to make them scarce enough to encourage environmentally friendly behaviour. Most experts agree that a price above \u20ac40 a tonne is necessary to encourage a switch to lower-carbon power generation. Last year it fell to $5 a tonne, is currently just below $6 and is not expected to reach $30 until 2030.</p> <p>The conclusion must be that all the intellectual capacity expended on a capitalist solution to climate change following Kyoto achieved no gain. Worse, it would appear that without carbon credits to shield corporate polluters, politicians would have come under pressure to devise a better system based on regulation.</p> <p>The City has an answer in the shape of green bonds aimed companies investing in green technology or climate friendly activities. The market in green bonds is young, but it could develop into one of the main sources of funding for \u201cgood\u201d businesses. What to do about the legacy of polluters? That will prove more difficult.</p> <h2>Sports Direct chairman must fight own corner</h2> <p>Mike Ashley tends to eschew City conventions \u2013 and next week will be no different. The Sports Direct founder and chief executive will not be attending his company\u2019s annual general meeting, as he avoids a repeat of last year\u2019s mild farce, when he took journalists on a guided tour of his Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire. It was a chastening experience, but at least it showed some accountability in the face of pressure from shareholders, politicians and trade unions to reform his business. This year, however, his chairman, Keith Hellawell, will be left to take the flak&#xa0;alone.</p> <p>A trio of powerful City investors are expected to vote against Hellawell\u2019s re-election but Ashley will not be there to defend him \u2013 even if he votes his stake, which is more than 60% of the business, in Hellawell\u2019s favour.</p> <p>So the chairman will be the lightning rod while the only executive who can enact real change at the company \u2013 Ashley, of course \u2013 stays away.</p>",
