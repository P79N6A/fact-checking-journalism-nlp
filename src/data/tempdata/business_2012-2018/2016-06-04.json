      "bodyText": "In 1661, Stockholms Banco, the precursor to the Swedish central bank, issued Europe\u2019s first banknotes, on thick watermarked paper bearing the bank\u2019s seal and eight handwritten signatures. Last year \u2013 as Britain did last week \u2013 Sweden launched a new series of notes, cheery affairs featuring 20th-century Swedish cultural giants such as Astrid Lindgren, the creator of Pippi Longstocking, Greta Garbo and filmmaker Ingmar Bergman. But like its Nordic neighbours Norway, Denmark and Finland, Sweden is fast becoming an almost entirely cashless society. \u201cI don\u2019t use cash any more, for anything,\u201d said Louise Henriksson, 26, a teaching assistant. \u201cYou just don\u2019t need it. Shops don\u2019t want it; lots of banks don\u2019t even have it. Even for a candy bar or a paper, you use a card or phone.\u201d Swedish buses have not taken cash for years, it is impossible to buy a ticket on the Stockholm metro with cash, retailers are legally entitled to refuse coins and notes, and street vendors \u2013 and even churches \u2013 increasingly prefer card or phone payments. According to central bank the Riksbank, cash transactions made up barely 2% of the value of all payments made in Sweden last year \u2013 a figure some see dropping to 0.5% by 2020. In shops, cash is now used for barely 20% of transactions, half the number five years ago, and way below the global average of 75%. And astonishingly, about 900 of Sweden\u2019s 1,600 bank branches no longer keep cash on hand or take cash deposits \u2013 and many, especially in rural areas, no longer have ATMs. Circulation of Swedish krona has fallen from around 106bn in 2009 to 80bn last year. \u201cI think, in practice, Sweden will pretty much be a cashless society within about five years,\u201d said Niklas Arvidsson, an associate professor specialising in payment systems innovation at Stockholm\u2019s Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). Arvidsson argues that the country\u2019s head start in the field began in the 1960s, when banks persuaded employers and workers to use digital bank transfers for wages as a matter of course, with credit and debit cards receiving a boost in the 1990s when Sweden\u2019s banks started charging for cheques. Cards are now the main form of payment: according to Visa, Swedes use them more than three times as often as the average European, making an average of 207 payments per card in 2015. More recently, mobile phone apps have also taken off in spectacular fashion. Swish, a hugely popular app developed jointly with the major banks including Nordea, Handelsbanken, SEB, Danske Bank and Swedbank, uses phone numbers to allow anyone with a smartphone to transfer money from one bank account to another in real time. \u201cSwish has pretty much killed cash for most people, as far as person-to-person payments are concerned,\u201d said Arvidsson. \u201cIt has the same features as a cash payment \u2013 real-time clearing, the same as handing over a banknote. And it\u2019s now making inroads into payments to businesses, too.\u201d Adopted by nearly half the Swedish population, Swish is now used to make more than 9 million payments a month. (A similar Danish app, MobilePay, was used by over 3 million Danes \u2013 in a country of 5.6 million \u2013 to make some 90 million transactions last year.) Street salesmen, from hotdog vendors to homeless magazine sellers, have enthusiastically adopted iZettle, a cheap and easy Swedish system designed to allow sole traders and small businesses take card payments via an app and mini card-reader plugged into their phones, with many reporting sales increases of up to 30%. Even Swedish churches have adapted, displaying their phone numbers at the end of each service and asking parishioners to use Swish to drop their contribution into the virtual Sunday collection. One Stockholm church said last year only 15% of its donations were in cash; the remainder were all by phone. There are, obviously, concerns: cases of electronic fraud have more than doubled in the past decade and several critics \u2013 including the inventor of iZettle, Jacob de Greer \u2013 have asked whether an entirely electronic system in which every single payment is recorded is not a threat to privacy. Old people\u2019s organisations also fear that those who prefer cash, out of a reluctance to use new technology or simply because they find it easier to keep track of their spending, will be disadvantaged, while educators worry that young people will be tempted to spend money they do not have. For these and other social reasons, Arvidsson said, cash is not dead quite yet. \u201cEven if, in the next few years, Swedes use almost no cash at all, going 100% cashless needs a political decision,\u201d he said.\u201cThe idea of cash, even in Sweden, remains very strong.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "The 10 questions Dominic Chappell must answer over the BHS collapse", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Dominic Chappell, one-time racing driver and the owner of BHS before it collapsed into administration, will be questioned by MPs this week about his role in the demise of the 88-year-old department store chain. Chappell faces a bruising session with MPs, likely to focus on how he came to own BHS and the money his consortium, Retail Acquisitions, took out of the business. The Observer has drawn up a list of key questions that MPs should ask Chappell \u2013 who has been declared bankrupt three times \u2013 to shed more light on the collapse of BHS. How long have you known Sir Philip Green and how were you introduced to him? This is an obvious place to start for MPs on the work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee. How did Chappell, with no retail experience and a very chequered financial history, cross paths with one of Britain\u2019s highest profile business leaders? It is understood that Chappell was introduced to Green through Paul Sutton, a convicted fraudster who was working on his own deal to buy BHS. It will be interesting to hear Chappell confirm the circumstances in which he met Green because it will highlight how much the billionaire knew about his background. Has Retail Acquisitions ever paid any monies to \u2013 or for the benefit of \u2013 Paul Sutton? After a dossier outlining Sutton\u2019s controversial history was sent to Green, the billionaire demanded written reassurance that Sutton had nothing to do with Chappell\u2019s takeover of BHS. Chappell has claimed that he cut ties with Sutton, but Retail Acquisitions lent money to a man connected to Sutton and a log of negotiations between Green\u2019s company Arcadia and Chappell in the run-up to the sale of BHS show that the billionaire was concerned that Sutton was still involved. MPs need to get to the bottom of the current state of the relationship between Sutton and Chappell, and this question is key to understanding whether the fraudster was in any way connected to Retail Acquisitions. Did you ever use your work at Olivia Petroleum \u2013 or the balance sheet of Olivia Investments \u2013 as a way of enhancing your credentials with BHS, your advisers or potential funders? Chappell has said Olivia Investments, his family\u2019s holding company in Gibraltar, enjoyed a \u00a35m \u201cbonanza\u201d that helped him to fund the rescue deal of BHS and demonstrated his track record as a businessman. However, a Guardian analysis of Olivia\u2019s publicly filed accounts shows that \u00a35m was an accounting estimate, and not the cash payment he had previously claimed. How much of your own money did you put into BHS? Where did this money come from? Chappell claims that Retail Acquisitions pumped \u00a315m into BHS. However, \u00a35m of this came from a loan secured against BHS\u2019s assets. If Chappell\u2019s \u00a35m \u201cbonanza\u201d from Olivia was not cash, then MPs should push for information about the source of the remaining \u00a310m. How do you know the Dellal family of property investors? Did Green know of your connection? Did you agree to loans and property deals with them because they provided you with \u00a335m? Allied Commercial Exporters (Ace), which is controlled by father and son Guy and Alexander Dellal, provided \u00a335m to Chappell, allowing him to demonstrate to Arcadia he was a credible businessman. Ace then bought a BHS office building next to its headquarters, called North West House, and sold it for a profit just weeks later. Ace also lent to BHS at such a fierce interest rate that it was known by the retailer\u2019s management as the \u201cWonga\u201d loan. These transactions made millions of pounds for Ace. MPs must try to establish whether the property deals and loans were connected to Ace putting up the \u00a335m. Ace says they were not and that all the agreements were made on commercial terms. It is understood that Chappell knew the Dellals, but how? And why did they decide to get involved with BHS? How much of the proceeds from property sales \u2013 including North West House and BHS\u2019s main warehouse premises in the Midlands \u2013 were reinvested into the business, and how much went into Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium? This is a simple question, but will Chappell be able to provide a simple answer? We already know that \u00a35m of the \u00a315m raised by selling BHS\u2019s warehouse was used to pay off a loan that Retail Acquisitions had taken out with Ace, and that Retail Acquisitions initially took more than \u00a31m from the sale of shops on Oxford Street in London and in Sunderland. How did BHS decide how much to pay Retail Acquisitions in salaries and management fees? How much did you personally make? The Guardian reported in April that more than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to Retail Acquisitions. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. Retail Acquisitions has said that salaries and management fees were independently benchmarked against other retailers. Chappell should provide details about which companies the fees were benchmarked against, the terms of the management services agreement, who approved this, and how much he was paid. How often did you speak to Green during your ownership of BHS? Sources close to Arcadia and BHS claim Chappell was in regular contract with Green during the 13-month period that Retail Acquisitions owned the business. Arcadia was a major creditor of BHS, and Arcadia brands including Wallis and Dorothy Perkins had concessions in its department stores, so such talks are understandable to a degree. However, what was the nature of their conversations? Why did Retail Acquisitions lend money against your father\u2019s house? Why did you move \u00a31.5m to BHS Sweden in the days leading up to BHS\u2019s collapse? These two transactions do not appear to be connected to the day-to-day running of BHS but may show how Retail Acquisitions managed the business. Chappell has said a \u00a31.5m loan was paid to a property company connected to his father and used to pay off the mortgage on the older man\u2019s house. Land Registry documents show that a house in Sunbury-on-Thames was bought last July by a company called JDM Island Properties for \u00a3850,000, with Retail Acquisitions named as the lender. Chappell also transferred \u00a31.5m to an entity called BHS Sweden, which is not connected to the British BHS, following a board meeting on 18 April that concluded that BHS needed emergency funding or would have to call in administrators. BHS management asked Chappell to repay the cash, but he paid it back \u00a350,000 short, saying this represented the cost of transferring the money into Swedish kronor and back again. Will Retail Acquisitions pay BHS the money it owes? Chappell\u2019s company still owes around \u00a36m to BHS after it took an \u00a38.4m loan out of the business. Administrators are working on recovering the money. Given that 11,000 workers are losing their jobs and the company has a \u00a3571m pension deficit, MPs should push Chappell about its repayment.",

And why did they decide to get involved with&#xa0;BHS?</p> <p><strong>How much of the proceeds from property sales \u2013 including North West House and BHS\u2019s main warehouse premises in the Midlands \u2013 were reinvested into the business, and how much went into Chappell\u2019s Retail Acquisitions consortium?</strong><br>This is a simple question, but will Chappell be able to provide a simple answer? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/bhs-collapse-owner-sold-main-distribution-centre-to-pay-off-loan\" title=\"\">We already know that \u00a35m of the \u00a315m raised by selling BHS\u2019s warehouse</a> was used to pay off a loan that Retail Acquisitions had taken out with Ace, and that Retail Acquisitions initially took more than \u00a31m from the sale of shops on Oxford Street in London and in Sunderland.</p> <p><strong>How did BHS decide how much to pay Retail Acquisitions in salaries and management fees? How much did you personally make?</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration\" title=\"\">The <em>Guardian</em> reported in April that more than \u00a325m was paid from BHS to Retail Acquisitions</a>. This included \u00a32.8m in management fees, \u00a32.1m in salaries and wages, \u00a311m in legal and professional fees and \u00a310m in interest payments. Retail Acquisitions has said that salaries and management fees were independently benchmarked against other retailers. Chappell should provide details about which companies the fees were benchmarked against, the terms of the management services agreement, who approved this, and how much he was paid.</p> <p><strong>How often did you speak to Green during your ownership of BHS?</strong><br>Sources close to Arcadia and BHS claim Chappell was in regular contract with Green during the 13-month period that Retail Acquisitions owned the business. Arcadia was a major creditor of BHS, and Arcadia brands including Wallis and Dorothy Perkins had concessions in its department stores, so such talks are understandable to a degree. However, what was the nature of their conversations?</p> <p><strong>Why did Retail Acquisitions lend money against your father\u2019s house? Why did you move \u00a31.5m to BHS Sweden in the days leading up to BHS\u2019s collapse?</strong><br>These two transactions do not appear to be connected to the day-to-day running of BHS but may show how Retail Acquisitions managed the business. Chappell has said a \u00a31.5m loan was paid to a property company connected to his father and used to pay off the mortgage on the older man\u2019s house. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/29/bhs-collapse-dominic-chappell-could-be-forced-to-repay-millions\" title=\"\">Land Registry documents show that a house in Sunbury-on-Thames was bought last July by a company called JDM Island Properties</a> for \u00a3850,000, with Retail Acquisitions named as the lender. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/26/bhs-owner-dominic-chappell-moved-funds-out-of-troubled-retailer\" title=\"\">Chappell also transferred \u00a31.5m to an entity called BHS Sweden</a>, which is not connected to the British BHS, following a board meeting on 18 April that concluded that BHS needed emergency funding or would have to call in administrators. BHS management asked Chappell to repay the cash, but he paid it back \u00a350,000 short, saying this represented the cost of transferring the money into Swedish kronor and back again.</p> <p><strong>Will Retail Acquisitions pay BHS the money it owes?</strong><br>Chappell\u2019s company still owes around \u00a36m to BHS after it took an \u00a38.4m loan out of the business. Administrators are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/29/bhs-collapse-dominic-chappell-could-be-forced-to-repay-millions?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">working on recovering the money.</a> Given that 11,000 workers are losing their jobs and the company has a \u00a3571m pension deficit, MPs should push Chappell about its repayment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Winston Churchill gazes out from one side of the new \u00a35 plastic note, the Queen from the other. But the chances of Prince William appearing on a banknote are looking slim. More than 300 years after the first Bank of England banknotes appeared, the new plastic ones could perhaps be the last. Stop a young adult on a British high street and you will find that one in eight has not a penny in cash on them. Even the ones who do are likely to have no more than \u00a320. For them, the cashless society is not tomorrow\u2019s world, but today\u2019s: a contactless card flashed to enter the tube; a smartphone tapped at Pret for a lunchtime sandwich; another card waved at a Tesco Express on the way home; the cab journey back from the pub processed by Uber. Who needs banknotes? According to a survey by payments company Worldpay, six out of 10 young adults would prefer not to use cash at all. When Transport for London banned cash on the buses in mid-2014, it was greeted with a backlash from some quarters; \u201cpassenger fury\u201d said one headline, \u201cban hits the vulnerable\u201d was another. Yet, two years on, behaviour has adjusted. TfL says it has saved \u00a324m in cash-handling costs, and queues have improved. The cashless society has been long mooted, but only now is it arriving. A 1996 trial in Swindon to encourage the town\u2019s 150,000-plus people to use \u201celectronic purses\u201d flopped through lack of interest. But contactless cards \u2013 there are now more than 36m in Britain\u2019s wallets \u2013 and more recently Apple Pay and Android Pay, have dramatically accelerated the switch away from cash. Crucially, it has been the readiness of big retailers to accept \u201ctap-and-go\u201d technology for small-value items, with Tesco and TfL at the forefront, that has spurred the revolution. Monthly spending on contactless cards is now running at around \u00a31.5bn, or three times the level of just a year ago. Technology experts see contactless payment as just a stepping stone to the cashless society, with smartphones becoming the main way to pay. Since the launch of Apple Pay in July last year, 8 million journeys on London Underground have been paid for by iPhone users tapping their handset at entry and exit points. Meanwhile, Google\u2019s rival, Android Pay, was launched last month. Unlike contactless cards, where spending is capped at \u00a330, Apple and Android users can spend more freely, although they may have to authenticate with a Pin or fingerprint. Traditional Pin-entry debit spending is fast being dumped by the public in favour of tap-and-go. A Pret a Manger source says: \u201cSixty five per cent of all card transactions at Pret are made using contactless technology,\u201d adding that it has a \u00a3250 limit for Android Pay, although that would pay for rather a lot of dolphin-friendly tuna baguettes. \u201cSmartphones are the final nail in the coffin for cash,\u201d says Dave Birch, director of innovation at Consult Hyperion, which helped TfL launch contactless payments. \u201cWe all thought it was going to be cards, but it\u2019s going to be phones that do for cash. With a mobile phone you can both pay and be paid \u2013 using Pingit and Paym. And, if you look at Uber, it\u2019s not about tap and go, it all happens within your phone. Tapping is a bit of a sideshow. I\u2019m not convinced that in a decade we\u2019ll be tapping, anyway; we call it moving from \u2018checkout\u2019 to \u2018check-in\u2019. Your Waitrose app on your phone will know who you are as soon as you walk in the store, and you\u2019ll use your fingerprint to buy as you go around.\u201d Worldpay, which handles 42% of payment processing in the UK, says the next more immediate step to cashlessness will be convincing every small independent shop and trader in the country to adopt contactless terminals. They don\u2019t come free; a newsagent has to pay around \u00a320 a month to rent a terminal, or upwards of \u00a3300-\u00a3500 to buy one, and more for software updates. The card companies will also take their cut, often 1% of every transaction. But Worldpay UK\u2019s marketing director, James Frost, who is behind the company\u2019s \u201chigh street to i-street\u201d project, reckons take-up will be swift. \u201cPeople forget there is a cost to businesses from using cash; you have to pay for security, insurance, making regular trips to the banks. Then there\u2019s that thing euphemistically called \u2018shrinkage\u2019 \u2013 when money goes missing. You don\u2019t have those sorts of headaches with contactless.\u201d He predicts that conventional cash tills, with their drawers for notes and coins and mini-printers for receipts, will soon disappear from shops, replaced by tablet-based terminals linked to contactless readers, with e-receipts sent to phones. Around one in 10 small shops still refuse card payments for small purchases, usually below \u00a35, but are expected to come in line as they are deserted by younger shoppers only prepared to use their phones. Cashless enthusiasts argue the black economy will be hugely diminished, and tax evasion made far more difficult \u2013 though privacy campaigners worry about the harvesting of huge amounts of new data. Bond fund supremo Jim Leaviss \u2013 in charge of M&amp;G\u2019s \u00a340bn in retail fixed-interest assets \u2013 reckons the move to a cashless society could even help end boom and bust in the economy. Outside London\u2019s South Kensington station stands an unlikely early adopter of the cashless revolution \u2013 Big Issue seller Simon Mott. Three years ago, he got an iZettle account to take card payments. Now he accepts Apple Pay and Android Pay. Charities whose rattling boxes are falling silent as cashless pedestrians pass by are among those most urgently trying to find new ways to obtain donations. Will cash machines on British high streets become as redundant as red phone boxes, a relic of yesterday\u2019s technology? Peter McNamara, chief executive of NoteMachine, which runs 9,000 ATMs across Britain and Germany, might be expected to refute that, but he makes a good point: On the 2 May bank holiday in the UK, more cash was withdrawn from ATMs in Britain than at any other time in history \u2013 \u00a31.72bn on the day, and 7% more than the same bank holiday the year before. The death of cash has been exaggerated, he says. \u201cConsumers still need and use cash \u2013 more so than ever before. The reason cash continues to prevail is because it gives us freedom. It will not be rejected by a third party, it is reliable and it enables us all to manage our personal finances with ease. \u201cThere is a real danger that the UK is being railroaded towards a cashless society, with the agenda driven hard by technology giants and card issuers who are keen to capitalise on the digital age \u2013 yet the evidence to support this suggests hype rather than reality.\u201d A major milestone on the path to a cashless society was passed in 2015, the first year that consumers used cash for less than half of all payments, according to Payments UK, which represents the major banks, building societies and payment providers. But perhaps mindful of the outcry that greeted an early plan to ban cheques, Payments UK has no plans to follow Nordic countries down the path of banning cash. It predicts that cash usage will not be eclipsed by debit cards and contactless until 2021. Meanwhile, even those who have declared war on cash warn about the losers. Birch says: \u201cThere\u2019s a class issue here. A lot of middle-class people already go from one day to the next without using cash. About the only time they use lots of cash is to pay a builder to avoid VAT. Poorer people are far more trapped in cash and the costs that go with it. They are the ones withdrawing \u00a310 from a machine and paying \u00a31.50 for it. We don\u2019t, as yet, have an equivalent to M-Pesa in Kenya, a mobile account for everyone.\u201d So it\u2019s Kenya, not Scandinavia, that may have the key to a cashless future. Just remember to keep your phone charged; in future, your journey to work, lunch and popping into the shops will be at the mercy of your battery. CASH: A BRIEF HISTORY These days we think of cash as a means of putting food on the table, but there was a time when currency could have been used to eat it too. Around 3,000 years ago, Chinese societies used small metal replicas of tools, such as knives and spades, as currency. As time went on and people grew tired of skewering their hands every time they reached into their pocket to settle a bill, the metal currency became round and flat \u2013 the origin of today\u2019s coinage. It wasn\u2019t until around 600BC in Lydia, in modern-day Turkey, that the first coins were minted en masse and stamped to denote different denominations. The practice spread into Europe and today\u2019s de facto global currency, the US dollar, has its roots in the \u201cthaler\u201d, a silver coin dating back to the mid-15th century. The name comes from the town of Joachimsthal in Bohemia, where silver mines were used to produce coins originally known as \u201cJoachimsthaler\u201d. We also have China to thank for the advent of paper money, first used in the Tang dynasty, which lasted from AD618 to AD907. The bills mostly took the form of letters of credit linked to specific transactions, but were a precursor to modern paper notes. It took Europe about another 500 years to catch on, but lenders and banks eventually started issuing notes that could be taken to a branch and exchanged for silver and gold. A shift towards governments printing their own bills gathered pace with the colonisation of North America. The long transatlantic journeys meant that colonists often ran out of cash, so paper IOUs became usable as currency, issued to soldiers and then spreading through the economy. Many governments still don\u2019t print their own money or mint their own coins, instead paying other countries and private companies \u2013 such as Basingstoke-based De La Rue \u2013 to do it for them. Britain\u2019s Royal Mint produces coins on behalf of dozens of other countries\u2019 governments. However, it does not disclose the identities of these governments for fear that their decision to outsource money-printing will cause embarrassment back home.",

The name comes from the town of Joachimsthal in Bohemia, where silver mines were used to produce coins originally known as \u201cJoachimsthaler\u201d.</p> <p>We also have China to thank for the advent of paper money, first used in the Tang dynasty, which lasted from AD618 to AD907.</p> <p>The bills mostly took the form of letters of credit linked to specific transactions, but were a precursor to modern paper notes.</p> <p>It took Europe about another 500 years to catch on, but lenders and banks eventually started issuing notes that could be taken to a branch and exchanged for silver and gold.</p> <p>A shift towards governments printing their own bills gathered pace with the colonisation of North America. The long transatlantic journeys meant that colonists often ran out of cash, so paper IOUs became usable as currency, issued to soldiers and then spreading through the economy.</p> <p>Many governments still don\u2019t print their own money or mint their own coins, instead paying other countries and private companies \u2013 such as Basingstoke-based De La Rue \u2013 to do it for them.</p> <p>Britain\u2019s Royal Mint produces coins on behalf of dozens of other countries\u2019 governments. However, it does not disclose the identities of these governments for fear that their decision to outsource money-printing will cause embarrassment back home.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ben Stein, writer, economist, actor and Republican, has seen a lot of elections but none like this. \u201cIt has been an extremely strange year,\u201d says the 71-year-old who got his start as a speechwriter for Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. Stein has never voted for a Democrat, but he is appalled by Trump\u2019s anti-free trade rhetoric that he says could lead to a trade war. Hillary Clinton probably has a better grasp of things, Stein thinks. Bernie Sanders, on the other hand, is \u201cwillfully ignorant\u201d. \u201cI have seen a lot of elections and I have never seen anything like this. It seems to me it is a testament to the complete collapse of education that people can have such preposterous policies as an end to free trade and think that\u2019s going to help America. It\u2019s just startling that: a) the candidates know so little and; b) that the voters have not been better informed about this. The American education system is in a state of freefall collapse so that certainly explains a lot,\u201d he says. What do you think the economy would look like two years into the presidency of all three remaining presidential candidates? All the candidates are against free trade \u2013 that\u2019s a disastrous mistake. Free trade is one of the main sources of economic growth. Any interference with free trade in the long run produces negative results for the country that imposes the restrictions. One of the great breakthroughs in all of human history has been free trade. When I hear Mr Trump or Mrs Clinton or Mr Sanders talk about how they are going to stop free trade and in some way block America from being part of the world trading system, it makes my blood run cold. That\u2019s a terrible, terrible prospect. Second, it is very clear, extremely clear, that additional regulation on the economy at this point would be a burden on growth and whichever candidate imposes the most regulation is going to get the least growth. I give credit to Mr Trump, who says he is going to reduce regulation. If Mr Sanders were president, it would be an absolute, total catastrophe. He would regulate the American economy to death. Mrs Clinton, I think, would do a fine job. I don\u2019t worry about her in terms of regulation at all. Except that her taxes on the fossil fuel industry are unwarranted and unwise. In terms of tax policy, all of them say they are going to cut taxes on the poor, but that\u2019s a fake because the American poor already pay no taxes. Approximately 50% of American wage earners don\u2019t pay any tax already, so that\u2019s a fake. In terms of raising tax on the rich, frankly, I think that\u2019s a good idea. The rich in this country are really, really rich. And they can pay more tax. Whether that\u2019s going to be enough to substantially affect the deficit is very, very questionable. I applaud Mr Sanders for wanting to seriously raise rates on the rich. That is something that should happen. If he did it, there would be a lot of yelling and screaming but I don\u2019t think the deficit would be affected very much. Mrs Clinton, I think, has a more balanced approach. I think probably a good approach. Mr Trump says he can both reduce taxes and reduce the deficit. That\u2019s complete nonsense. What do you think of Trump as a businessman? He is not a great businessman. He inherited a great deal of money. He did some successful real estate deals. Hardly anyone could miss doing successful real estate deals in New York considering the incredible boom that has taken place and the very low base point when he started out. He is not a great businessman at all \u2013 in no way. Let me back up and say, everyone I know says he is an incredibly nice guy. That\u2019s got to count for something. I don\u2019t think he is a great businessman and even if he were a great businessman, that doesn\u2019t mean he would be a great steward of the US economy. The two have nothing to do with each other. Imagine Trump is elected president and he starts enforcing some of the policies he has mentioned. Would the economy improve, stay the same or get worse? It would get much worse. In terms, it would be a disaster. Trade is very important. The US economy is roughly 15% trade dependent \u2013 very roughly 15%. The question of the day: would his gains in fossil fuel deregulation offset the losses in trade? I doubt it. It\u2019s very, very important that he get educated about the benefits of free trade. What does his popularity with working-class Americans mean? What do the regular folks feel about the economy? I don\u2019t think the regular folks \u2013 of course, I don\u2019t know that many regular folks \u2013 but I don\u2019t think the regular folks know much about the economy or about how trade works. If the regular folks think that China came along in the middle of the night and stole all their jobs, then nothing could be further from the truth. It\u2019s just nonsense. I think Trump is popular because he says: I am going to go to China and get those jobs back. But he is not going to be able to do that. And any attempt to try would be a disaster. Could we educate people about why certain jobs have been lost? Anything to change their minds about this kind of rhetoric? I don\u2019t think so. I hate to say that. The only thing, I think, that would change their minds is if one of these anti-free trade candidates became president and they saw the terrible results. I think that might change their minds. There are plenty of smart people out there saying: don\u2019t stop free trade. Keep free trade alive and well. I don\u2019t think Mr Trump is listening. I don\u2019t think Hillary is listening. I don\u2019t think Mr Sanders is listening. I don\u2019t think they are listening. Are you surprised that Trump is basically the nominee of the Republican party? I am absolutely \u2026 I am open-mouthed, gasping, unbelievable. But he has his charms. There must be something people like about him. I don\u2019t get him but there must be something people like. I\u2019ll vote for him, by the way. I\u2019ll vote for him because I think he does personify a kind of national pride which I think has been lacking in the Obama days and would be terribly lacking under Bernie Sanders and terribly lacking under Hillary Clinton. But I think his economics is way, way out of whack and he seriously needs some education about it. Do you think Congress would let Trump implement the type of policies he has suggested? Yes, I do. If he had Republican Congress, I think they would let him attack free trade. But then when the trade war starts and businesses start closing, I think they would be singing a different tune. You said the candidates know so little. Do you think it\u2019s that they know so little or are they just saying what they think people want to hear? I don\u2019t think Trump knows a goddamn thing about economics. But I like him anyway, I might add. I think Mrs Clinton knows something about it. She is an intelligent woman, she went to Wellesley. She was a classmate of mine at Yale law school and I hope we learned something while we were there. And, as to Mr Sanders, I think he is purposely, willfully ignorant. I think he is a person who could be educated but he has some kind of personality defect that prevents him from being educated.",

      "bodyText": "A Carlsberg advert, entitled The Crate Escape, offers a flavour of how the beer industry traditionally views women. The premise is that a group of long-suffering men, dragged to a health spa by their other halves, hatch an ingenious plan to dig a tunnel to smuggle beer past a security detail of stern female physicians. The unsuspecting wives and girlfriends are none the wiser. If such clunky stereotyping sounds like the preserve of mainstream ad campaigns, some smaller brewers rely on even cruder messages. What are female beer-lovers to make of Legspreader, a US-made bitter whose logo features a woman, her modesty covered only by the brewery\u2019s name? A beer named Top Totty, brewed by Staffordshire based Slater\u2019s Ales and featuring a scantily clad woman, was only removed from the House of Commons Strangers Bar in 2012 after complaints. Slater\u2019s describes it as \u201ca stunning blonde beer, full bodied with a voluptuous aroma\u201d. Other examples include Slack Alice, a cider that is \u201ca little tart\u201d, and Bristol\u2019s Ale and Naughty Noelle, whose labels both feature buxom women. It\u2019s hard to imagine many of these labels getting the thumbs-up at this weekend\u2019s Fem.Ale festival in Norwich, an annual event aimed at the women who brew and drink craft ale. Fem.Ale\u2019s mission statement is to \u201ccontinue combining feminism and activism with beer to celebrate women who are still underrepresented in numbers working in the beer industry and dispel the idea that beer is a drink only for men\u201d. Beer and food writer Melissa Cole, a loyal fan of Fem.Ale, is all too familiar with beer companies\u2019 ham-fisted approach to gender. \u201cA new brewery approached me recently saying \u2018Meet our Wild Blonde\u2019. It was a blonde beer obviously. It\u2019s so tired and naff and hackneyed. What bothers me is that nobody thinks about the ramifications for women working in the industry.\u201d \u201cWhen you name things Wild Blonde, and people see a blonde barmaid, it says that kind of seaside postcard bawdy humour is welcome here. What can the woman do without risking her job?\u201d But with events such as Fem.Ale, not to mention a recent explosion of micro-brewing allowing anyone to set up shop on their own, the landscape is beginning to shift. Sara Barton, director of Brewster\u2019s Brewing Company, has watched the gender gulf narrow in the course of her career. \u201cWhen I started back in the late 80s it was a strange thing to see a woman in the brewing industry. It has become less unusual as time moved on and women enter supposedly male jobs,\u201d she says. Barton is the instigator of Project Venus, a network of female brewers \u2013 known in the industry as brewsters \u2013 who meet regularly to swap tips and brew together. Over the years, she has witnessed successive attempts to tap into female audiences, some more successful than others. \u201cBig companies have tried to make \u2018lady beers\u2019. There was one made by Molson Coors called Anim\u00e9e that had a couple of million invested in it but it bombed.\u201d Anim\u00e9e was lighter than average and featured a more colourful, almost chintzy, label. Like fellow \u201cfemale-friendly\u201d brew Carlsberg Eve, it fell flat. \u201cWomen don\u2019t like to be patronised,\u201d Barton points out. Where beer companies have often got it wrong is in the assumption that women either want something fruity or lighter, less alcoholic and therefore less flavourful. If anything, the reverse is true. \u201cThey do say that women have a lower threshold of being able to taste things,\u201d says Barton. \u201cSo on tasting panels, women sometimes discern more. The long and short of it is that women are proven to have a better sense of taste than men,\u201d Cole says. There is plenty of evidence to support the claim. The reigning brewer of the year \u2013 awarded by the British Guild of Beer Writers \u2013 is Jenn Merrick of Beavertown Brewery, based in London\u2019s Walthamstow. And the industry boasts a clutch of highly regarded brewsters, such as Sue Fisher of Gadds\u2019 Ramsgate Brewery and Belinda Jennings, head brewer at Woodforde\u2019s, which has made an Earl Grey-infused brew especially for Fem.Ale called GRRRL Grey. Camra, the real ale enthusiasts\u2019 group, recently embarked on a project aimed at modernisation, a process overseen by Emily Ryans. \u201cMore than 20% of our membership is female and this proportion is growing,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a young, female Camra member and enthusiastic beer drinker myself, I\u2019ve certainly noticed a rise in the availability and variety of good quality beer in recent years. \u201cWe are now looking at how we position ourselves in light of this and other developments in the industry and society.\u201d Jane Peyton, author of Beer O\u2019Clock and the instigator of Beer Day Britain on 15 June, is the first winner of the UK\u2019s first Beer Sommelier of the Year awards. She welcomes the growing number of brewsters and female beer fans but feels that many firms, large and small, are still relying on tired, sexist tropes. \u201cIt\u2019s not changing quickly enough unfortunately. There are still brewers using that laddish imagery, which is bonkers because women are 51% of the population. It demeans men as well as women and it\u2019s bad for business.\u201d If beermakers want a lesson on women\u2019s role in beer, says Peyton, they should look to history. \u201cWomen were the original brewers of beer \u2026 and in the creation myths of many cultures, beer was given to humans by females.\u201d But Peyton isn\u2019t confident that beermakers will abandon their comfort zone of lads\u2019 culture marketing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time for that to happen,\u201d she says.",
