      "bodyText": "Britain's 10 million mortgage payers have been warned to ready themselves for dearer borrowing costs after a Bank of England policymaker said stronger-than-expected growth meant the era of ultra-cheap money was drawing to a close. Ian McCafferty, one of the four external members of Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee, said on Thursday that the exact timing of a rate rise remained uncertain, but the Bank wanted to ensure that the many borrowers who have become used to more than five years of official interest rates at 0.5% were not taken by surprise. In an interview with the Guardian, McCafferty said the economy had beaten the Bank's forecasts so far this year and the survey evidence pointed to further robust expansion ahead. \"There is momentum in the pace of growth, and it looks like it will continue over the rest of the summer,\" he said. \"Overall, the economy has come a long way in the last 12 to 18 months.\" He said the Bank had felt it right to point out the risks that borrowing costs might rise sooner than expected because the City had not responded to the signs that the recovery was continuing to gather pace. \"There didn't seem to be any material shift in expectations about what we might do,\" the MPC member said. \"Were we to have to go early \u2013 and that will depend on how the economy performs over the summer and autumn \u2013 I think it would have been damaging if it was portrayed as a surprise. It appeared the markets were more certain of the date of lift-off [for rates] than we were.\" Up until last week, the City had been preparing for an interest rate rise in early 2015, but comments by the governor, Mark Carney, McCafferty and fellow MPC member Martin Weale have shortened the odds on a move this year. Sterling climbed to a near six-year high against the US dollar on Thursday as it looked increasingly likely that the UK would take the lead on raising interest rates. The pound rose by a cent as it pushed above the $1.70 mark, reaching levels not seen since October 2008. The CBI warned that the hgher pound could damage exporters. \"The economy has grown a little faster than might have been expected at the beginning of the year,\" McCafferty said, adding that there were signs that growth in the second and third quarters of 2014 would also beat the Bank's forecasts. He added that the Bank's forward guidance was intended to prepare businesses and individuals for the first rise in interest rates, particularly given concerns that many households were more vulnerable to increases in the cost of home loans than they had been in the past. \"We can't be certain that the economy will be more sensitive to rate rises or a series of rate rises than they were in the past but there are arguments that they will be,\" he said. \"It is not just that interest rates have been at a low level for such a long period. We have had people with squeezed incomes, and they have used low mortgage payments to offset that.\" McCafferty added: \"The notion of gradualism is absolutely critical to allow actors to adapt at a pace they find more comfortable than if we were to move at a more rapid rate. \"Even if the date of lift-off is uncertain, people will have an idea how rates will be moving over a longer period.\" McCafferty said the MPC wanted to reassure the public that rates would be raised in a way that caused the minimum amount of disruption. He said he would not disagree with the Bank's outgoing deputy governor, Charlie Bean, who has estimated that rates would settle at around 2.5-3%. While not seeing any immediate inflationary threats, McCafferty said that survey evidence and his own conversations with business leaders suggested that wages might be growing more strongly than shown by the official data. But he said the Bank had not left it too late. \"We are only now coming back to the 2008 level of GDP. Unemployment is significantly higher than its medium-term natural level. There is some slack in the economy after a year of solid growth that we can absorb before we have to worry about the inflationary consequences. I have no big worries at the moment.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT's ability to spend heavily at the forthcoming Premier League auction is under threat after Ofcom proposed restrictions on its wholesale broadband profits. Sports rights have become key in BT's drive to win broadband customers against competition from TalkTalk and BSkyB, with the company offering free subscriptions to sports channels when selling superfast internet connections. But the watchdog has raised the prospect of tighter controls over the wholesale prices BT charges competitors for piggy-backing on its broadband network. \"This is a watershed,\" said telecoms expert James Barford at Enders Analysis. \"It discourages BT from spending a lot more money in any future auction, including the Premier League. From Sky's perspective this is excellent news. Talktalk is very pleased because it gives some comfort that BT will stay honest.\" The watchdog says that from next year it will police the margin between the wholesale price of BT fibre optic lines and the retail prices it charges customers. The so-called margin control mechanism is designed to stop BT undercutting rivals. TalkTalk and BSkyB have not built their own copper and fibre lines and rely on BT's network to sell a broadband service. TalkTalk currently plays \u00a38 a month for a BT fibre to the street cabinet service, but thinks the price should be closer to \u00a35. TalkTalk's cheapest fibre package is \u00a313.50 a month, while BT's is \u00a316. To calculate the margin charged by BT, Ofcom will take into account what the company has spent on rights, broadcasting and production for its BT Sport channels, such as the \u00a3900m deal to snatch Champions League rights from ITV and BSkyB. This means the cost of the sports rights cannot be hidden within the margin between wholesale and retail prices. TalkTalk and BSkyB argued the offer of free Premier League football and other contests should be taken into account because they make BT's broadband offering more appealing. The move is likely to dampen BT's appetite to use sport as a loss leader and may force the acceleration of any decision to start charging for the sports channels. The next Premier League auction will cover the rights to matches from the 2016/2017 season and analysts predict that competition between BT and BSkyB could drive up the price of a three-year deal from the combined \u00a33bn that both companies paid out for the current deal. The price of BT's copper broadband is already regulated, but Ofcom has so far resisted controlling fibre pricing to encourage BT to build out its superfast network. The first stage, covering cities and larger towns, is now complete.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The energy firm npower has been told to report to Ofgem every month on its progress in reducing late billing or risk having to scrap some of its telesales activities, under the latest crackdown by the energy regulator. Ofgem, now under new leadership, has also opened a new investigation into npower's failures to deal properly with complaints raised six months ago. The move was endorsed by the energy secretary, Ed Davey, and came 24 hours after a new report from consumer group Which? showed that 1.7m complaints had been made to the major six energy providers in the first three months of 2014. Sarah Harrison, senior partner in charge of enforcement at Ofgem, said npower customers had suffered service failures for too long. \"That's why Ofgem has secured binding commitments from npower to reduce its bill backlog or face curbs on sales, alongside launching a wider investigation under Ofgem's new standards of conduct,\" she said. \"Ofgem has been monitoring npower's service closely and we have been increasingly concerned about the slow progress to tackle failings. nNpower's recovery plan has not delivered as far and fast as is necessary. Our analysis of complaints data also raises some serious concerns which will be thoroughly examined in our investigation.\" Npower admitted that late billing currently affected 280,000 customers holding over 400,000 accounts. \"We are committed to getting things right for our customers, but recognise that despite the progress we have madem our billing standards have fallen short of where everyone wants them to be,\" said Paul Massara, npower's chief executive. \"We are happy to provide the assurances agreed with Ofgem, with whom we share the same objective of getting our customer service to where it needs to be,\" he added. The company has been given to the end of August to resolve its billing problems, after which Ofgem will force it to cease all proactive telesales to new customers until the issues are resolved. The parallel investigation into customer service failings could lead to a financial penalty or redress payments if npower is found to have broken rules. The subsidiary of Germany's RWE group has been going through a damaging period, paying out \u00a33.5m in February for mis-selling and being fined \u00a32m two years before that for poor handling of complaints. Ed Davey said it was unacceptable that so many npower customers had not received the customer service they deserve and said he fully supported Ofgem's intervention. \"Our [energy market policy] reforms are making it easier and quicker for people to switch energy suppliers, particularly to the growing number of independent suppliers, so all energy companies need to be doing more for their customers.\" Which? also welcomed the move. \"Npower are consistently the worst for consumer satisfaction and this week topped the list for customer complaints, so Ofgem is right to take tough action,\" said executive director Richard Lloyd. \"It is completely unacceptable for energy companies to neglect the basics of customer service. If they are unable to look after their existing customers, then clearly they have no right to new ones.\" In the Which? survey, Npower received 83 complaints for every 1,000 customers, while there have been new industry rows in recent weeks about whether wholesale energy price falls are being passed on to retail customers by suppliers. Tom Lyon, energy expert at online price comparison site, uSwitch.com, said billing issues were one of consumers' biggest gripes, with one-fifth of households being billed incorrectly by the wider industry last year and companies taking longer than ever to resolve complaints. He said: \"Customer service is becoming an increasingly important factor in the decision to switch energy supplier; consumers want to feel valued, as well as getting a better deal, so it's vital that energy companies put customers at the heart of what they do. It is encouraging to see that npower's recovery plan is delivering improvements, but we encourage them to do more.\"",

As such, sealing control of transport networks \u2013 the Chinese firm Cosco already controls half of the container terminal at Pireaus port \u2013 will be a top priority.

Following the Federal Reserve chair's latest update, stock markets have moved sharply higher (except Wall Street, which made its gains last night and is now suffering from a bit of profit taking) while the dollar has dipped. One consequence of that is that the pound has touched near six year highs against the dollar, and is currently quoted at $1.7043. The scores on the doors showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 29.55 points or 0.44% higher at 6808.11 \u2022 Germany's Dax added 0.74% to 10,004.00 \u2022 France's Cac climbed 0.72% to 4563.04 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended 0.85% better at 22,236.63 \u2022 Spain's Ibex rose 0.68% to 11,187.8 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 012% or 20 points lower. And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow. Over in Greece expectation is mounting ahead of a crucial visit to the country by Chinese premier Li Keqiang. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. This is the first time since the start of the economic crisis that Greece will play host to Chinese officials. And with investments the name of the game it is going all out with the red carpet treatment. From early this morning the Greek parliament has been flying a large Chinese flag visible to passers by in Syntagma square. Chinese premier Li Keqiang will kick off the three-day official tour holding talks this afternoon with Antonis Samaras his Greek counterpart. With Keqiang accompanied by a 14-member government delegation and large retinue of businessmen, several key accords are expected to be signed including a contract providing funding for small and medium sized enterprises established in China. A joint declaration and bevy of bilateral agreements, not least a tourism accord aimed squarely at promoting Greece as a top destination for Chinese holidaymakers, will also be signed. The Chinese premier, who will spend the third day of his tour visiting Crete, (where China has expressed interest in buying a controlling stake in the island\u2019s international airport) has said openly that Beijing wants to boost its cooperation with a country that it now sees as the easiest transit route into Europe. As such, sealing control of transport networks \u2013 the Chinese firm Cosco already controls half of the container terminal at Pireaus port \u2013 will be a top priority. The premier will spend much of Friday paying an on site tour of the two main container terminals managed by the company. Almost five years after Cosco moved into Piraeus it has signalled that it wants to expand its presence but acquiring a 67 percent stake in the part of the port still under Greek government control. Roads, ports and railways are also of interest to Beijing as the world\u2019s biggest developing nation seeks ways of enhancing its network of exports into Europe. \u201cA deeper comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Greece is bound to contribute more to the well-being of our two people and the prosperity and progress of the world.\u201d Li Keqiang wrote in a rare address published in the Greek Kathimerini newspaper spelling out the purposes of his visit. The pound is now at its highest level against the dollar in almost six years: \u2022 STERLING HITS $1.7045, HIGHEST SINCE OCTOBER 2008 A gentle start on Wall Street, where the main indices are little changed from last night DOW JONES DOWN 4.36 POINTS, OR 0.03 PERCENT, AT 16,902.26 AFTER MARKET OPEN NASDAQ UP 6.30 POINTS, OR 0.14 PERCENT, AT 4,369.14 AFTER MARKET OPEN S&amp;P 500 UP 0.41 POINTS, OR 0.02 PERCENT, AT 1,957.39 AFTER MARKET OPEN In parliament the Treasury Committee has given its stamp of approval to Kristin Forbes, MIT professor, joining the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. After a hearing yesterday, Andrew Tyrie MP, said: \u201cThe Committee is satisfied that Professor Forbes has the professional competence and personal independence to be appointed to the Monetary Policy Committee and wishes her every success in her new role. \u201cThe Committee also welcomes the fresh perspective Professor Forbes should bring to the MPC from her economics and public policy experience in the US.\u201d During the hearing, the Committee appeared concerned that Forbes - an expert on financial contagion - has not worked specifically on monetary policy before. She explained that her work on macro-economic themes such as how crises spread, and on global capital flows, were crucial to modern monetary policy. Last night's dovish tone from the US central bank has lifted European stock markets, pushed the pound higher, and sent the VIX volatility index down to its lowest level in around eight years. The Fed sparked the rally last night, by giving no clear indication of when interest rates might rise, and by refusing to panic about the recent pick-up in inflation. As Kit Juckes of SocGen put it: In the end, Janet Yellen's dovish bias ruled. The Fed is more worried about anchoring long-term rate expectations than preparing the market for rate hikes. Other economists pointed out that the Fed is not willing to risk knocking the US economy back by raising rates too soon: European stock markets are close to their highest level in six years. Here's a snapshot, after Japan's Nikkei hit a four-and-a-half month high: FTSE 100: up 0.7% at 6827, +48 points German Dax: up 0.85% at 10015, +84 points French CAC: up 1% at 4575, + 45 points Italian FTSE MIB: up 1% at 22251, +222 points Spanish IBEX: up 1.1% at 11234, +122 points Global investors were also cheered by the Fed's declaration that \"[US] economic activity has rebounded in recent months\". It's the financial markets favourite cocktail -- the promise of more loose monetary policy today, and the prospect of growth tomorrow. David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities, commented: \"The overall tone was pretty dovish and the forecast for economic growth seems lower than expected, which is good for equities. Central banks continue to drive markets big time.\" The Euro STOXX 50 Volatility index, Europe's main \"fear gauge\", tumbled 9 percent to 12.6 - a level not seen since 2006. The pound is trading steadily at its highest level since August 2009, at $1.7035 to the US dollar \u2013 prompting the CBI to warn it could hurt exports. And the dollar remains lower today against most currencies -- as traders adjust to the fact that Janet Yellen did not, as some predicted, give hints about when interest rates might rise. Ioan Smith, director at KCG, said (via Reuters) \"There was a fear that the Fed would pick up more of a hawkish rhetoric, which they didn't do. It was probably patience on their part, even after the uptick in inflation in May.\" The oil price has reached a new nine-month high today. Brent crude hit $114.80 per barrel for the first time since September 2013. That's partly due to the dollar having weakened, but also caused by fears that the insurgency in Iraq could hit supplies. Over to Reuters for details: Government forces battled Sunni militants for control of Iraq's biggest refinery as Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki waited for a U.S. response to an appeal for air strikes to beat back the threat to Baghdad. The Baiji refinery, 200 km (130 miles) north of the Iraqi capital near Tikrit, was a battlefield as troops loyal to the Shi'ite-led government held off insurgents from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and its allies who had stormed the perimeter, threatening national energy supplies. (Full Story) If the 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery stays closed for long, Baghdad will need to import oil products to meet its own domestic consumption, further tightening oil markets. \"This would stress an already reasonably tight global balance further, depending on its duration,\" oil analysts at Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy said in a note to clients. Encouraging jobs data from America just hit the wires - the number of people filing new claims for unemployment fell last week, from 318,000 to 312,000. And the 'continued claims' total dropped to 2.561m, from 2.615m -- Reuters says that's the lowest level since October 2007. Paddy Power have issued new odds on where the pound will end the year - and they suggest sterling will continue to rally from today's $1.702: In good news for holidaymakers the 5/6 favourite is between $1.76 to 2.00, while there\u2019s 8/1 should it head north from there. It\u2019s 9/2 for $1.50 or less and 11/8 to finish the year between $1.51 and $1.75. One of the Bank of England's interest rate setters, Ian McCafferty, has confirmed that the Monetary Policy Committee is inching closer to raising borrowing costs. In a speech just released, McCafferty also said the decision will \"critically\" depend on data (inflation and wage growth, me thinks).

Helena says: Just passed the finance ministry on Servias Karaegorgis street off Syntagma Square, and despite the rowdy demonstrations earlier today there is an air of festivity about the cleaners' burgeoning protest. The entrance to the ministry now resembles a tent city with laid off school guards and school teachers also pitching tents, tables and chairs outside the building. A blackboard proclaimed that this was the 44th day the cleaners have been there. \"And we are going to stay for as long as it takes,\" said Despoina Kostopoulou, aged 53, and the cleaners' de facto spokeswoman. \"Our aim is to get our jobs back and if that means us being here all through the summer so be it,\" she said adding that around 15 cleaners slept outside the building every night. \"Every day we will plan a protest. This weekend I am going to Yannina to give a speech. We are becoming much more organised and as you can see solidarity for our position is growing. The school guards and teachers came around 15 days ago. They have helped boost our morale.\" The strong pound risks denting Britain's recovery, by making it harder for manufacturers to export, the CBI has warned this morning. Katja Hall, CBI deputy director-general, is concerned that the strength of sterling \u2013 to a near five-year high of $1.702 today \u2013 will hurt overseas orders. Hall said: \u201cDemand for British made goods remains buoyant and that\u2019s helped drive this quarter\u2019s further rise in output. \u201cGrowth is broad-based, with the recovery spreading its roots, and firms have high hopes for the coming quarter. \u201cHowever, the recent rise in Sterling could impact on the resilient export orders we\u2019ve seen lately. On the other hand -- factory owners should be reassured that the US Fed thinks America's economy will recover pretty strongly through the rest of this year. Hall was speaking after the CBI's monthly survey of manufacturers showed that factories are raking in new business. Order books have swelled to a six-month high - close to the 18-year high achieved last December. The CBI reports: Demand for UK-made goods rose strongly in June... This strength was broad-based, with above average results in 14 out of the 17 sectors. The food and drink sector was particularly robust, reporting its fullest order books in just under four years. Ukraine has a new central bank governor -- former investment banker Valeria Hontareva (also written as Gontareva). Hontareva's appointment was \"overwhelmingly\" approved by the Ukraine parliament this morning, having been nominated by new president Petro Poroshenko. Hontareva has previously held senior roles at ING and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and ran headed local investment bank Investment Capital Ukraine. In her new role, she'll be negotiating with the IMF over the financial assistance Ukraine needs since the Crimea crisis began. She told MPs that: \"My appointment can be seen as a positive signal for bankers and a positive signal for international investors.\" The Ukrainian Hrynvia has strengthened a little today against the (generally weakening) dollar, up 0.75% to 11.86 to $1. In the City, the hottest ticket of the day appears to be a place at the annual general meeting of Quindell, the technology outsourcing and consultancy company. Perhaps sensing trouble ahead, Quindell took the precaution of banning her Majesty's press pack from the event. But Twitter user Private-Investor is there, and reports that hordes of shareholders have descended So why the rush? Well, back in April, Quindell's shares tumbled after US research firm (and short seller) Gotham Research launched a remarkable attack on the company, questioning its profitability - which Quindell swiftly rebutted. Its share price remains bruised, though: Will Hedden of IG says the London stock market is \"holding on to the coat tails of US markets and a dovish Federal Reserve meeting,\" with the FTSE 100 now up 58 points, or 0.86%. Less than half a dozen blue chips are trading in the red, with no notable fallers. On the upside Rolls-Royce (+6%) has powered to the top spot, having promised shareholders a billion pounds in buybacks, after it sold its gas turbine unit to Siemens earlier in the year. Janet Yellen's relaxed approach to last month's rise in US inflation has helped drive shares up. Hedden points out that the VIX index, which tracks volatility, has hit a seven year low: The Fed\u2019s reaction to recent inflation data as 'noise' created a nice echo for equity bulls, with US indices pushing back towards their early June all-time highs and the VIX printing a low close not seen since February 2007. As the US dollar keeps weakening, the pound has touched a new near-five year high of $1.7028. As flagged up earlier, travellers on Britain's West Coast line can look forward to four more years of Virgin Trains, after the company paid \u00a3430m to keep running the service. The deal comes two years after the government handed the line to rival First Group, only to slam on the brakes after flaws in the process were exposed. Virgin has promised to spend \u00a320m brushing up the stations, convert some 1st class carriages into standard class for the rest of us to cram into, and install super-fast WiFi: Virgin Trains to run west coast mainline until 2018 UK retail sales fell back in May, but sales of football replica shirts stopped the decline being worse, according to data just released. The amount spent in the retail industry increased by 3.2% last month, compared with May 2013, but was 0.5% lower than the previous month. That's the first monthly fall of the year, but largely as expected after retailers benefitted from the late Easter in April. And there was a 28.9% surge in spending at sporting goods and toy stores, compared to a year ago. A new fitness frenzy? Not exactly...The Office for National Statistics explains that events in Brazil are probably responsible: Feedback from retailers in these stores has suggested that the increase in sales in May 2014 is due to the build-up of the FIFA World Cup. A better picture of the impact of the World Cup on retail sales statistics will be available when June data are released on 24 July 2014. The data also gives little sign of inflationary pressures, with average prices paid at the till falling. The ONS says: Average prices of goods sold in May 2014 showed continued deflation of 0.7%, fuel once again providing the largest contribution, falling by 2.2%. Food stores were the only sector to show an increase (0.4%) however, this series continues to fall and is now at its lowest level since March 2006 (0.3%). And here are the key charts: European stock markets are close to their highest level in over six years, reports Reuters, after this morning's rally (see 8.19am): The rise left the FTSEurofirst 300 just 0.1 percent off of its 2014 high set earlier this month, which was the index's highest level since January 2008. In Greece, cleaning workers who lost their jobs last summer in the austerity cutbacks are protesting outside the office of New Democracy, the governing party. Via Twitter, here are a couple of photos from the scene from crisis-watcher @inflammatory_ These cleaning staff have been calling for their jobs back for many months. In May a judge ruled they should be reinstated, only for another court to suspend that ruling. And still they fight on. The strength of the pound should reduce inflationary pressures in the UK, points out economist Shaun Richards: The weakness of the dollar has also pushed the euro higher - which will not be welcome, as eurozone inflation is running at just 0.5% per year (compared to 1.5% in the UK). Sterling has hit its highest level in almost five years against the US dollar this morning, as currency traders reacted to last night's events. The pound pushed back over the $1.70 mark to hit $1.7017, a level not seen since August 2009. Janet Yellen's dovish words on inflation and unemployment have pushed down the dollar, as has the news that Federal Reserve policymakers believe interest rates will eventually peak at a low level (3.75%, down from 4%). Europe's stock markets are open, and they're rallying in early trading as traders take their cue from last night's Federal Reserve meeting. The FTSE 100 has jumped by 46 points, or nearly 0.7%, to 6825. The German, Spanish, Italian and French markets all rose by 0.8%. The biggest riser in London is Rolls-Royce, which announced a bit share buyback this morning. But share are gaining across the board - here's the risers and fallers: Traders are pushing shares higher after Fed chair Janet Yellen gave no indication that recent increases in inflation, and drops in unemployment, required a rise in borrowing costs. As Jasper Lawler of City firm CMC Markets explains: Yellen didn\u2019t seem too concerned about the recent rise in consumer price inflation and chose to emphasise the risks that low inflation could pose to economic performance. For unemployment, the Chair referenced the decreasing participation rate saying some of the improvements to the headline rate were as a result of \u201cshadow unemployment or discouragement\u201d; both of which impy a continued need for stimulus. Australia's stock market has enjoyed its best day's trading of the year, sharing in the wider Asian rally. The Federal Reserve's upbeat view of the US economy drove investors into buying mining stocks, scenting profits if the world's biggest economy picked up pace. And the lack of any hints of an early US interest rate rise also drove shares up. From Melbourne, Stan Shamu of IG explains: The boards have lit up in Asia today after the Fed delivered a dovish tone, while the market seemed to have been positioned for a slightly more hawkish tone. This saw US equities extend gains to fresh record levels and this has also resonated through to Asian markets. There's nothing like a dovish central bank to get the stock markets moving upwards, and Janet Yellen appears to have done the trick last night - sending most Asian markets rallying. The Federal Reserve was upbeat about US economic prospects (as we wrote last night), despite actually cutting its growth forecast for 2014 following the bad winter. And while the Fed \"tapered\" its bond-buying package by another $10bn per month, to $35bn, Yellen gave no indication of exactly when interest rates might start to rise. And Fed members' own forecast of where interest rates might reach in the long term fell from 4% to 3.75%. That sent the S&amp;P 500 to a fresh record high last night, and Japan's Nikkei has followed the trend - hitting a four-month high. As Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo, explained: \"The Fed sees the U.S. economy as on track, while it hinted of low interest rates in the long term.\" Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the financial markets, the world economy, business and the eurozone. Today I'll be watching the reaction to yesterday's Federal Reserve meeting, where it cut its stimulus programme by another $10bn.... ...we'll also keep an eye on Argentina's battle to avoid default over the row with holdout creditors. In Europe, the International Monetary Fund will be presenting its assessment of the eurozone economy to finance ministers -- and arguing that the European Central Bank should consider buying government bonds. As one source put it to Reuters: \"The draft from the euro zone mission restates more strongly the request previously made to the ECB to do more to fight the risks of deflation. \"It doesn't mention 'quantitative easing' but it does talk about bond purchasing programmes.\" While in the UK, the latest retail sales figures will show if consumers kept spending in May. In the corporate world, Virgin Rail Group has announced it has secured a new deal to keep running the West Coast Main Line. More to follow on all those issues, along with other news through the day....",

The engine-maker has never before conducted a share buy-back; now it will spend \u00a31bn on its own shares. For good measure, it pledged to the City on Thursday that capital expenditure, which was worth about 5% of revenues last year, will fall to 4% over the next three to five. What's going on? Not quite as much as it might appear. This is not a case of City short-termism overwhelming long-term investment. There is a perfectly good reason why capex, expressed as a percentage of revenues, will fall. The big spending on factories to produce the latest engines for wide-bodied aircraft has been made, and sales should accelerate from about 2017. Thus it would be a surprise if capex did not fall. Spending on research and development, which is only part of Rolls-Royce's overall capex bill, should continue as before. The company has not changed character. What has happened, though, is that management has bowed to shareholders' wishes to give up dreams of big acquisitions. In January it was revealed that Rolls-Royce had been in talks with Finnish group W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, a purchase that would have been worth about \u00a38bn. The strategic appeal was obvious: it might have solved the perceived problem that Rolls-Royce is underpowered in marine engines. Yet it became clear that shareholders were not keen on re-opening talks with W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4. A deal would have been a case of too much, too soon. Rolls-Royce has never splashed out such sums on a single purchase; a rights issue would have been needed; and a \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a31.9bn) deal, Rolls-Royce's biggest, to buy Daimler out of a joint venture in reciprocating engines in Germany is already in train. Whether or not he now shares shareholders' views on W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, chief executive John Rishton has decided the deal is definitively dead. \"No material acquisitions,\" are planned he says, thus the decision to direct the proceeds of the sale to Siemens of a gas turbine business towards a share buyback. The no-big-deals policy looks correct for now. Rolls-Royce has usually performed best when it has concentrated on organic investment and invention, albeit with a few smaller bolt-on deals on the side. That is the 20-year winning formula via which Trent engines have grabbed half the global market in wide-bodied aircraft. The magic has to be repeated elsewhere, such as boats, but you can't blame shareholders for insisting that W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 carried too many uncertainties.

      "bodyText": "As bosses go, Dov Charney, the founder of US fashion brand American Apparel, had an unusual attitude to suitable office attire and acceptable executive behaviour. He once hosted a meeting wearing nothing but a single sock \u2013 not on his foot \u2013 and he has been cited in numerous sexual harassment lawsuits brought by former employees. On Thursday, however, after 25 years steering the firm famous for its Made in America T-shirts and Y-fronts, he was heading for the exit as his fellow directors fired him as chairman and declared an intention to oust him as chief executive after repeated allegations of misconduct against him. Charney has made no secret of his louche tastes. The 45-year-old, who has described himself as \"a dirty guy\", strolled his factory floor wearing only his underpants and has been accused of using adverts that verge on pornography \u2013 including one featuring himself and two women captioned: \"in bed with the boss\". There have been allegations of homophobic remarks. One lawsuit claimed he had called one employee a \"wannabe Jew\" and then tried to strangle him. It was notoriously alleged that he had had oral sex with an employee while conducting an interview with a journalist. On Wednesday night, the company ousted its maverick boss and made it clear the decision \"was not the result of any problems with the company's operations\". Instead it said the decision to axe Charney \"grew out of an ongoing investigation into alleged misconduct.\" Allan Mayer, who has been on the board since 2007 and takes over as co-chairman, said: \"We take no joy in this, but the board felt it was the right thing to do. Dov Charney created American Apparel, but the company has grown much larger than any one individual and we are confident that its greatest days are still ahead.\" Charney built the American Apparel label into one of the world's most admired fashion brands. He won plaudits for his \"Made in America\" policy, which shunned the sweatshops of Asia to support US manufacturing, paying double the minimum wage to his mainly immigrant workforce, providing health insurance and free international telephone calls. Charney once boasted that he had the best paid clothing workers in the world. The business still operates from a huge factory in downtown Los Angeles, and employs 10,000 staff, but its fortunes have declined as its founder's racy lifestyle has caused more and more problems, even though Charney has publicly dismissed the harassment claims made against him as \"sexual shame tactics\". In 2011, Irene Morales accused Charney of \"extreme psychological abuse and torment\" from when she started working as a shop assistant aged 17 in 2007, although a judge later dismissed her $260m claim after it emerged she had sent her former boss explicit pictures and messages. Charney, who is Canadian but says he felt a draw to the dynamism of the US from childhood, founded American Apparel as a wholesaling business in 1991 with a $10,000 loan from his father. A decade later he started opening shops and the business now has some 250 outlets in 20 countries. The label was a sensation in the 2000s as Charney built the brand based on hipster chic and an image based on the sexual mores of the 1970s. The Guardian named American Apparel label of the year in 2008 and the following year Charney was a finalist for Time magazine's 100 most influential people of the world. But as the harassment claims against Charney mounted, the brand's appeal began to fade. Changing fashion trends and the severe recession of the late 2000s made young shoppers less keen to pay \u00a330 for one of Charney's plain T-shirts. Sales plunged and debts mounted. In February, the company hired restructuring advisers after its debt hit $240m (\u00a3141m), taking it close to breaking loan agreements with its banks. First-quarter results announced last month showed sales falling and a loss of $5m. Last year it lost more than $100m. The company's share price has plunged from around $14 in 2008 to close last night at just $0.64, down by two thirds in the past year. John Luttrell, the chief financial officer, will act as chief executive while American Apparel looks for a permanent replacement for Charney. But the controversial boss may not be going quietly. A report in the Chicago Tribune said that Charney had been shocked by his removal, and a source told the paper that he intended to \"fight like hell\" to be reinstated.",

Tria arrived in the wake of the September 11 attacks, when it arose as a way for the government to protect the insurance companies from taking huge losses that would put them out of business after a terrorist attack.</p> <p>The rationale behind Tria is simple. Previously, there was no contract by which companies could protect themselves from terrorism costs. That was a disaster when the insured loss for 9-11 approached $40bn, with most of it paid by insurance companies and the firms who insure <em>them</em>, known as reinsurers. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/04/22/326977.htm\">The appeal is clear \u2013 to insurers, who have been raking in cash. Over 60% of all businesses</a> have purchased government-subsidized terrorism insurance since 2002. The program has cost the government $1m a year \u2013 almost nothing \u2013 but has made an estimated $40bn in revenue for insurance companies, who have never paid a claim, or given a dime to the government for their reinsurance protection.</p> <p>\u201cThis is largely a handout to the insurers and the insured industries,\u201d said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.</p> <p>Some wonder whether the program, designed to limit the economic fallout from terrorism, has simply built the insurance industry a money machine, subsidizing their business with risk-free profits. <br></p> <p>\u201cTo me it\u2019s a subsidy that largely benefits corporations,\u201d Calabria said, arguing that insurance companies get a lower risk to their profits, and businesses get artificially cheap insurance. \u201cYou\u2019re not minimizing the costs of terrorism, just shifting them from corporations to the taxpayer.\u201d</p> <p>Clearly the insurance industry<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/04/22/top-insurance-ceo-steps-up-call-for-extending-terrorism-insurance-program/\"> likes the guarantee</a>, having profited handsomely from it. So they have no motivation to change the status quo.</p> <p> And lawmakers are in a tough spot, responding to the fear of economic calamity in the event of an attack by effectively giving the insurance industry a free lunch. </p> <p>Yet Tria sails on blithely, drawing support from Democrats and Republicans every time, without fail. The association with anti-terrorism virtually assures passage through Congress \u2013 despite little public debate over what this legislation actually does and who it benefits.</p> <h2>Profits from terrorism protection <br></h2> <p>Here\u2019s how Tria rewards insurance companies: Tria only gets triggered if the Treasury secretary designates an attack as a \u201cterrorist event.\u201d <br></p> <p>That\u2019s a high bar: Even the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303704304579378841417222338\">Boston Marathon bombing</a> was not considered a terrorist attack for insurance purposes. In fact, the industry <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Boston-Marathon-bombings-make-some-rethink-terror-5415409.php\">got a boost</a> from that event, as more businesses decided to buy terrorism coverage in the aftermath.</p> <p>The law creates a threshold of total insurance losses from terrorist attacks in a given year, originally $10bn (the threshold has risen over the years to $27.5 bn). <br></p> <p>After that, the government kicks in, effectively becoming the reinsurer on terrorism claims, and paying a whopping 85% of the costs. The law allows the government to recoup those payouts in subsequent years with a 3% surcharge on annual premiums, but the industry pays nothing up-front for the reinsurance protection -- which would cost them a lot if they had to buy it from a private company. </p> <p>Tria has been popular with the financial and real-estate industries in particular. Financiers for everything from office parks to college buildings <a href=\"http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/04/22/326977.htm\">want the protection</a>, and wouldn\u2019t fund large-scale construction without it. The <a href=\"http://www.insureagainstterrorism.org/who.html\">Coalition to Insure Against Terrorism</a> includes policyholders from just about every large business sector, from Citigroup to Campbell\u2019s Soup, from hotels to chain restaurants. They believe the federal backstop supports the economy by facilitating investments and making insurance prices affordable for companies. <br></p> <p>In 2002, terrorism was an imminent risk. But in the subsequent 12 years, Tria has never paid out, nor have any insurance companies, according to experts. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe only cost to the program has been administrative, about $1m a year,\u201d said Henry Willis, director of the Rand Corporation\u2019s Homeland Security and Defense Center.</p> <p>Because Tria forced transparency from insurers for the cost of terrorism insurance, we have a decent handle on precisely how much insurance companies have collected from companies in premiums. <br></p> <p>Tom LaTourette, a Senior Physical Scientist with Rand, ran the calculations. \u201cIn the end, I came up with $4.6bn a year,\u201d he said. <br></p> <p>From that estimate, you can make a reasonable guess that the insurance industry has accumulated over $40bn in revenue from terrorism insurance premiums since the introduction of TRIA -- without ever paying a claim, and without giving a dime to the government for their reinsurance protection.</p> <h2>Tria: the never-used legislation that Congress loves<br></h2> <p>Calabria, a staffer for the Senate banking committee in 2002 when the issue first passed, says that the insurers pitched Tria as a temporary measure. Given the atmosphere in Washington after 9/11, it was an easy sell. <br></p> <p>Tria has been reauthorized twice, in 2005 and 2007, and a third extension would push it out to at least 2019. <br></p> <p>After a <a href=\"http://www.kirk.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=1051\">bipartisan deal</a> on a seven-year extension, the Banking committee <a href=\"http://www.banking.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Newsroom.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=d759e623-ca6c-f90e-483f-4cd485db8404\">passed it unanimously</a> earlier this month. House Republicans created a five-year extension that would increase the trigger for Tria to kick in, and lower the government share of the costs from 85% to 80%. Democrats objected, but supported \u201cmoving the process forward,\u201d and the House version passed out of committee Thursday on a party-line vote. <br></p> <p>The House Republican version also includes a study on whether to charge insurance companies for the government reinsurance protection. But in Washington, commissioning a study is what you do when you don\u2019t actually want to change anything.</p> <p>The probability of a terrorist attack is<a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-05-21/what-kills-you-and-your-investments\"> vanishingly low</a>, and government already funds insurance against it in the form of the Department of Homeland Security and the massive budgets for intelligence and defense. But Tria will nonetheless almost certainly get renewed. \u201cYou can count the opposition on one hand,\u201d Calabria said.</p> <h2>The birth of terrorism insurance <br></h2> <p>When TRIA was first created, the 9/11 attacks had created a financial catastrophe for insurance companies. Terrorism wasn\u2019t covered in any of their policies. The expense was so high, and the event so anomalous, that reinsurers subsequently refused to reimburse the insurers for all the costs of corporate property damage.</p> <p>Insurance companies responded by seeking state-by-state terrorism exclusion clauses, similar to exclusions for events like war. But New York, California and Texas held out. These states, considered at greatest risk for future attacks, feared being on the hook for bailing out the insurers and companies affected in the aftermath. <br></p> <p>At the same time, financiers pressured developers of large buildings to get insurance protection from terrorism, but without government subsidies, insurers were reluctant to offer it. Billions of dollars in real estate projects were stalled or canceled as a result.<br></p> <h2>Replacing government-backed terrorism insurance<br></h2> <p>Tria is just profit-boosting kabuki, critics say. <br></p> <p>Mark Calabria of Cato sees this as a total giveaway. He also considers the program unnecessary. He supports either a return to private reinsurance options, or voluntary, multi-state risk-sharing pools, without federal backing.</p> <p>Congress could make this a fully public program, removing the taint of what looks like an insurance industry bailout. But insurers get all kinds of largesse from Congress; just this month they<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-04/prudential-metlife-gain-as-senate-eases-dodd-frank-law.html\"> engineered one of the few changes</a> to the Dodd-Frank Act, simply to relieve them from a regulatory burden.</p> <p>Other experts argue that the insurance industry could not figure it out on its own; it just cannot mathematically predict the risk. </p> <p>\u201cWe have learned about terrorism risk, but it\u2019s hard to model those really catastrophic events we\u2019ve never seen but can\u2019t discount entirely,\u201d said Henry Willis of Rand, who wrote a recent report on the subject. \u201cThat\u2019s where government steps in.\u201d<a href=\"http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR611.html\"><br></a></p> <p>Rand and other<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/219306167/President-s-Working-Group-on-TRIA-Report-2014\"> government-funded studies</a> argue that costs are actually lower with the backstop than if Tria went away. Federal disaster assistance would be more expensive, they argue.<br></p> <p>But without a public discussion, it\u2019s hard to see whether Tria merely facilitates commerce and lowers the risk of a terrorist attack becoming an economic disaster, or if it just facilitates corporate welfare, with government guaranteeing the costs, and insurance companies taking the profits.</p>",

Insurance companies responded by seeking state-by-state terrorism exclusion clauses, similar to exclusions for events like war. But New York, California and Texas held out. These states, considered at greatest risk for future attacks, feared being on the hook for bailing out the insurers and companies affected in the aftermath. At the same time, financiers pressured developers of large buildings to get insurance protection from terrorism, but without government subsidies, insurers were reluctant to offer it. Billions of dollars in real estate projects were stalled or canceled as a result. Replacing government-backed terrorism insurance Tria is just profit-boosting kabuki, critics say. Mark Calabria of Cato sees this as a total giveaway. He also considers the program unnecessary. He supports either a return to private reinsurance options, or voluntary, multi-state risk-sharing pools, without federal backing. Congress could make this a fully public program, removing the taint of what looks like an insurance industry bailout. But insurers get all kinds of largesse from Congress; just this month they engineered one of the few changes to the Dodd-Frank Act, simply to relieve them from a regulatory burden. Other experts argue that the insurance industry could not figure it out on its own; it just cannot mathematically predict the risk. \u201cWe have learned about terrorism risk, but it\u2019s hard to model those really catastrophic events we\u2019ve never seen but can\u2019t discount entirely,\u201d said Henry Willis of Rand, who wrote a recent report on the subject. \u201cThat\u2019s where government steps in.\u201d Rand and other government-funded studies argue that costs are actually lower with the backstop than if Tria went away. Federal disaster assistance would be more expensive, they argue. But without a public discussion, it\u2019s hard to see whether Tria merely facilitates commerce and lowers the risk of a terrorist attack becoming an economic disaster, or if it just facilitates corporate welfare, with government guaranteeing the costs, and insurance companies taking the profits.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson's cumulative dividends from Virgin Trains are set to pass \u00a3300m after the government gave the firm a revised deal to run the west coast main line until 2017, with a probable one-year extension. Almost two years since Virgin set its lawyers on the government after First Group briefly won the rights to the London-Manchester-Glasgow rail route, the joint venture between Branson and Stagecoach has renegotiated its contentious deal with an uncontested franchise award that City analysts believe will triple its profits from the line. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the deal meant Virgin would pay at least \u00a3430m to run the west coast main line, and would provide thousands of extra seats, better Wi-Fi, station upgrades and other improvements. The \"risk and reward\" franchise replaces a management contract that gave Virgin a 1% margin. Damian Brewer, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: \"If it is in line with other recent direct awards, we think that margin is likely to be around 3%.\" Virgin said the government would also benefit from higher payments from increased fare revenues, if economic growth matches expectations. The 2012 franchise row \u2013 and problems revealed at the DfT \u2013 led to the government suspending its franchising programme. Virgin, which had run the line since 1997, was reinstated under a management contract but has been seeking to renegotiate the deal ever since. Train operators argue that franchise incentives such as the new deal are a key driver of passenger numbers, but Stagecoach's April trading update reported annual revenue growth on the west coast main line of 5.9% under the existing deal, in which the government pays a straight cut of fares to Virgin. The rail business has been a consistent earner for Branson's group while other businesses have struggled. Virgin Trains' performance has ranged from a \u00a313m pre-tax loss in 2006 to \u00a3105m pre-tax profit in 2009. His Virgin Atlantic airline has lost about \u00a3250m in the past three years. In 2013, Branson said he had shared \u00a3499m in dividends from Virgin's train business with Stagecoach, which owns the remaining 49% of Virgin Rail. The new deal will see Virgin run the lucrative line until March 2017, with an option for one more year before any potential competitor could take over. Brewer added that early experience from this new deal could also help Virgin seal the forthcoming east coast main line franchise \u2013 currently run by state-owned Directly Operated Railways \u2013 noting that the same mechanisms will be used in the tender to be decided this autumn. \"We think they will be potentially more educated than other east coast bidders, potentially increasing their chances of winning the east coast contract, all other things equal,\" he said. Stagecoach Group saw its shares rise nearly 2% to 374.7p. Patrick McCall, Virgin Trains' co-chairman, said: \"We're delighted to have reached a deal after some tough negotiations with the DfT. It puts the problems of 2012 firmly behind us, and shows the clear benefits of a well-run franchise system.\" Virgin has agreed to convert one first-class carriage to standard class on 21 trains, meaning 5,500 more standard-class seats a day \u2013 a net increase of 2,100 seats overall. It will install free, faster Wi-Fi on its trains, and spend more than \u00a320m to improve stations, including waiting rooms, seats and shelters. The firm also plans to operate new direct services from Shrewsbury and Blackpool to London, a pledge announced on several occasions since 2012 but not delivered, although Virgin is now confident that Network Rail and regulators will back weekday services. Patrick McLoughlin, the transport secretary, said: \"This deal will provide thousands more seats and better journeys for the tens of thousands of passengers who use these services every day. The west coast provides a vital artery between London and Scotland and it is crucial we do everything we can to improve services on this much-used route.\" But Mary Creagh, the shadow transport secretary, said: \"This is the latest chapter in the botched west coast franchise process, which has left passengers and taxpayers paying the price for government incompetence. \"The west coast's long-suffering passengers will welcome \u00a335m of service improvements, but this franchise process has already cost taxpayers at least \u00a350m directly and hundreds of millions of pounds more through delays to investment on the line and other franchise competitions.\" Unions also criticised the deal. Mick Cash, the RMT's acting general secretary, said: \"The collapse of the tendering process on the west coast has allowed Virgin to bully themselves into a monopoly-provider position, hoovering up repeated extensions while the public sector option is ignored.\" Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said Virgin was being \"rewarded for failure\".. \"We have seen fares rise by 245% on this route since privatisation and overcrowding on routes into London despite taxpayers paying \u00a39bn to upgrade the line,\" Cortes added. But passenger groups welcomed the deal. Anthony Smith, Passenger Focus's chief executive, said it would \"be glad to see long-awaited improvements such as more seats, and new direct services\". But he added: \"It is important that this short-term extension is used to prepare and deliver a better, more passenger-focused franchise where the passenger voice has been heard and taken into account.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain's construction industry is expected to cool during the summer following a slowdown in the number of new contracts. A survey by Barbour ABI found that a rise in contract signings between April and May of 5.3% was not enough to offset a fall over the spring that left the value of contracts down 3.7% on the same time last year. The survey follows a series of official figures showing a gentle fall in construction activity. The Markit/CIPS construction PMI this month reported that construction output had grown at the slowest pace in seven months in May after edging lower in April, to 60 from 60.8. A figure above 50 indicates a period of expansion. The survey found that residential housing starts accounted for around a third of the entire sector's work amid signs of weak activity in the infrastructure and civil engineering industries. Only two of the past 14 months have seen residential construction take a slice less than 30% of contract wins, while growth in commercial space such as offices, shops and warehouses has fallen. Michael Dall, lead economist at Barbour ABI, said London was the UK's hotspot for construction activity in May, accounting for 24% of the UK total as a result of big-ticket projects including Selfridges' redevelopment of its Oxford Street store and the Hyde residential development in the West End, worth a combined \u00a3500m. He said: \"After the poor weather impacting the growth of contracts awarded at the start of the year, it's positive to see the construction industry bouncing back with a healthy month-on-month increase in activity.

      "bodyText": "UK retail sales fell for the first time since January last month despite World Cup fever which drove higher sales of football shirts. Shoppers generally proved unwilling to spend last month with the volume of retail sales down 0.5% over the month in May, compared with a 1% increase in April as consumers stocked up on goods for Easter. A drop in food, petrol and household goods sales dragged the number down in May, offsetting strong growth in other areas including internet sales, clothing and footwear, and second hand goods including charity shops and antiques. Sales at sports shops were up 3.9% over the month according to the Office for National Statistics, which said the sector has showed continued growth since the London Olympics in 2012. In May however the boost came from football fans preparing for the start of the World Cup. \u201cFeedback from retailers in these stores has suggested that the increase in sales in May 2014 is due to the build-up of the FIFA World Cup,\u201d the ONS said. On a quarterly basis, retail sales rose by 1.3% in the three months to May, marking the longest period of growth in six and a half years. Sales were up 3.9% over the year. Economists had predicted the monthly drop in sales in May after a strong performance in April and said the underlying picture for retail sales remained strong suggesting that consumer spending will continue to contribute to Britain\u2019s economic recovery. Consumer confidence is rising amid a growing economy, rising house prices, falling unemployment, low inflation, and low interest rates. However, wage growth remains weak, lagging inflation and keeping the pressure on households which have faced falls in real pay for the majority of the past six years. Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThere is a danger that spending growth slows if real earnings do not pick up soon. But we remain optimistic that a further fall in inflation and a recovery in productivity in the second half of this year will lift real pay and hence provide more solid foundations for the recovery in consumer spending.

      "body": "<p>The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey released each year provides a great view of how the nation is changing. The latest survey released earlier this week shows we are becoming less dependent upon welfare, but that there are signs inequality is increasing. It also found Australian men continue to be much lazier around the house than women.</p> <p>The Hilda survey has been running since 2001 and involves interviewing the same households each year. In effect it is a mini census. By using the same sample each year it is able to, for example, look not just at inequality in a single year, but to examine income mobility (the ability for individuals to improve their income position from one year to the next), and also to look at individual\u2019s \u201cpermanent income\u201d (essentially the long term income level rather than one subject to one-off increases or declines).</p> <p>The survey found that individuals pretty much stay in the same income percentile every year (or crudely, the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor). It also found that there has been a slight increase in the ratio of the income of wealthier households to poorer ones.<b><br></b></p> <p>The ratio of the permanent income of the median households (p50) to the households in the 10th percentile (ie 90% of households earn more than it) was relatively flat to the GFC-stable equality. But the impact of the GFC has seen the permanent income of the median households increasing faster than the poorest household:<b><br></b></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/25Zwo/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Similarly the permanent income of households in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile is increasing faster than in median income households. This would suggest increasing inequality \u2013 a finding supported by the Hilda survey measure of the Gini coefficient. While the yearly Gini coefficient bounces up and down a bit, permanent income inequality has steadily been rising over the past decade:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/GVhoP/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The rise over time is only slight, and the GFC did briefly see the yearly rate fall \u2013 mostly due to rises in pensions and benefits and falls in the highest income levels. But in 2010 and 2011 the norm of increasing inequality appears to have returned.<br></p> <p>One trend which shows little sign of changing is Australians\u2019 declining dependence on welfare. Contrary to all the fears and invective from Joe Hockey, Kevin Andrews and others in the government, fewer households and individuals are on welfare than in the past, and the dependence of households on welfare has also declined:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/9hDtC/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Similarly when we look at who is receiving welfare, the treasurer\u2019s arguments that the welfare system is too broad once again falls to pieces:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/FDHcm/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While households in the bottom income quintile (ie the poorest 20%) receive around 70% of their income from welfare, the drop off in welfare dependence is astonishingly fast. Those in the median quintile receive around just 12% of their income from welfare benefits.<br></p> <p>This closely matches the findings by the OECD I noted on Monday. With this amount of data on the issue, to continue to suggest Australia\u2019s welfare system is poorly targeted and too broad begins to involve worrying levels of delusion.</p> <p>The Hilda survey also breaks down household income sources by family type. Here we find the overwhelming likelihood of dependence on welfare is determined by age and whether or not you are in a single parent household:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/m5OQk/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" ozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>While the average household gets 23% of its income from welfare benefits, elderly households get on average anywhere from 48% to 60% from welfare. Incidentally the Hilda survey found that the reliance of those over 65 years of age on the aged pension has also declined since 2001.</p> <p>In 2001 80% of those over 65 received the pension and it contributed on average 67% of their income. In 2001 77% were on the pension and on average just 60% of their income came from it.<b><br></b></p> <p>But the above average reliance of single parents on welfare (around 50% of such household\u2019s income comes from welfare) is also reflected in their above average poverty levels. The Hilda survey defines relative poverty if their household equivalised income is less than 50% of the median household equivalised income. At this (admittedly arbitrary) level they suggest such households are \u201cunable to afford the goods and services needed to enjoy a normal or mainstream lifestyle in the country in which they live\u201d.<b><br></b></p> <p>On this measure single-parent households are the only household to show any significant increase in poverty levels this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/5Kabz/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The survey notes that poverty rates rose \u201cparticularly from 2007, which coincides with the period of operation of the \u2018welfare-to-work\u2019 reforms\u201d. Among these changes was theshifting of some lone parents from the parenting pension onto Newstart.</p> <p>In 2013 the Gillard government broadened these moves. That tranche of single parents is not included in these figures though the data suggests that the likely outcome of the policy is for the poverty rates of single parents households to increase.<br></p> <p>And given in 2007, 87% of single parents were women, it\u2019s pretty clear who the changes hit the most. It would be nice if I could say that at least those women in a couple at least are having someone share the load, but when we look at the level of housework done by men and women, it\u2019s brutally clear that men drop the ball.</p> <p>In households where men are the main breadwinners, they do only 14.5 hours of housework a week compared to 27.6 hours by the woman in that household. While that might seem fair, when we look at households where women are the main breadwinner, the imbalance is revealed.<b><br></b></p> <p>In those households men do around 17.5 hours a week of housework, but women do 21.5hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Graph\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/SAnzT/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\"msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"480\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Even worse, these hours do not count childcare time.

      "bodyText": "The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey released each year provides a great view of how the nation is changing. The latest survey released earlier this week shows we are becoming less dependent upon welfare, but that there are signs inequality is increasing. It also found Australian men continue to be much lazier around the house than women. The Hilda survey has been running since 2001 and involves interviewing the same households each year. In effect it is a mini census. By using the same sample each year it is able to, for example, look not just at inequality in a single year, but to examine income mobility (the ability for individuals to improve their income position from one year to the next), and also to look at individual\u2019s \u201cpermanent income\u201d (essentially the long term income level rather than one subject to one-off increases or declines). The survey found that individuals pretty much stay in the same income percentile every year (or crudely, the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor). It also found that there has been a slight increase in the ratio of the income of wealthier households to poorer ones. The ratio of the permanent income of the median households (p50) to the households in the 10th percentile (ie 90% of households earn more than it) was relatively flat to the GFC-stable equality. But the impact of the GFC has seen the permanent income of the median households increasing faster than the poorest household: Similarly the permanent income of households in the 90th percentile is increasing faster than in median income households. This would suggest increasing inequality \u2013 a finding supported by the Hilda survey measure of the Gini coefficient. While the yearly Gini coefficient bounces up and down a bit, permanent income inequality has steadily been rising over the past decade: The rise over time is only slight, and the GFC did briefly see the yearly rate fall \u2013 mostly due to rises in pensions and benefits and falls in the highest income levels. But in 2010 and 2011 the norm of increasing inequality appears to have returned. One trend which shows little sign of changing is Australians\u2019 declining dependence on welfare. Contrary to all the fears and invective from Joe Hockey, Kevin Andrews and others in the government, fewer households and individuals are on welfare than in the past, and the dependence of households on welfare has also declined: Similarly when we look at who is receiving welfare, the treasurer\u2019s arguments that the welfare system is too broad once again falls to pieces: While households in the bottom income quintile (ie the poorest 20%) receive around 70% of their income from welfare, the drop off in welfare dependence is astonishingly fast. Those in the median quintile receive around just 12% of their income from welfare benefits. This closely matches the findings by the OECD I noted on Monday. With this amount of data on the issue, to continue to suggest Australia\u2019s welfare system is poorly targeted and too broad begins to involve worrying levels of delusion. The Hilda survey also breaks down household income sources by family type. Here we find the overwhelming likelihood of dependence on welfare is determined by age and whether or not you are in a single parent household: While the average household gets 23% of its income from welfare benefits, elderly households get on average anywhere from 48% to 60% from welfare. Incidentally the Hilda survey found that the reliance of those over 65 years of age on the aged pension has also declined since 2001. In 2001 80% of those over 65 received the pension and it contributed on average 67% of their income. In 2001 77% were on the pension and on average just 60% of their income came from it. But the above average reliance of single parents on welfare (around 50% of such household\u2019s income comes from welfare) is also reflected in their above average poverty levels. The Hilda survey defines relative poverty if their household equivalised income is less than 50% of the median household equivalised income. At this (admittedly arbitrary) level they suggest such households are \u201cunable to afford the goods and services needed to enjoy a normal or mainstream lifestyle in the country in which they live\u201d. On this measure single-parent households are the only household to show any significant increase in poverty levels this: The survey notes that poverty rates rose \u201cparticularly from 2007, which coincides with the period of operation of the \u2018welfare-to-work\u2019 reforms\u201d. Among these changes was theshifting of some lone parents from the parenting pension onto Newstart. In 2013 the Gillard government broadened these moves. That tranche of single parents is not included in these figures though the data suggests that the likely outcome of the policy is for the poverty rates of single parents households to increase. And given in 2007, 87% of single parents were women, it\u2019s pretty clear who the changes hit the most. It would be nice if I could say that at least those women in a couple at least are having someone share the load, but when we look at the level of housework done by men and women, it\u2019s brutally clear that men drop the ball. In households where men are the main breadwinners, they do only 14.5 hours of housework a week compared to 27.6 hours by the woman in that household. While that might seem fair, when we look at households where women are the main breadwinner, the imbalance is revealed. In those households men do around 17.5 hours a week of housework, but women do 21.5hours. Even worse, these hours do not count childcare time. There the imbalance is even more pronounced. In households where women are the main breadwinners, the men on average spend nearly 13 hours a week caring for their children, compared to women who spend on average nearly 22.5 hours. It would be good if I could mansplain this all by saying, yeah but men work more hours in paid employment. But when you combine hours worked in employment, housework and childcare, men come off looking like a bunch of lazy, couch-lying, TV-watching sloths: In households where men and women earn roughly equal amounts, men work on average 43 hours compared to women who work 36 hours. But then in housework and childcare, men do a mere 28.3 hours compared to the women who do nearly 57 hours. Sure the survey found men are a bit better than we used to be, but geez, 28 hours to 57? Good luck, men, trying to justify that.",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable has rebuked the Bank of England on Wednesday for blocking reforms to lending rules that currently favour mortgages over loans to small businesses. The business secretary said the regulator stood in the way of changes to banking sector regulations that demand lenders keep bigger reserves to support business lending than they do for residential mortgage loans. In a speech in London, Cable said high street bank chiefs had warned him that business lending was unlikely to increase while draconian capital requirement rules treated business customers as a higher risk than mortgage borrowers. He said: \"The way the regulatory system operates has undoubtedly had a suffocating effect on business lending and particularly on our exporters. \"Not surprisingly, the result is that banks pump out lending in the mortgage market, while lending to small businesses is restricted. This directly stems from the rules on which the regulatory model is based and has had a very damaging impact.\" He said the Bank refused to bend rules to favour small businesses because they were set internationally and could not be amended. The Bank of England believes lending to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is more risky by its nature and requires higher capital to guard against bad loans. But it has previously argued that banks with larger reserves enjoy lower capital costs and can therefore arrange cheaper lending to customers. It has also offered capital relief on new SME lending for banks that participate in the funding-for-lending scheme. \"I'm not suggesting there is some perverse individual blocking all this. I just think the situation could be freed up and the decision-makers are sitting inside the Bank,\" said Cable. He also warned that an early rise in interest rates could put the economic recovery at risk, the Telegraph reported. \"If these incipient inflationary pressures lead to a rise in interest rates sooner and further than is warranted by the economy as a whole, it could place in jeopardy our hopes for a sustained and balanced recovery,\" he said. The business secretary has campaigned for the government to take a more robust approach to boost business lending. He has set up a business bank, which has lent \u00a3780m and is involved in a pilot to use government funds to underwrite SME lending by commercial lenders. \"This would allow banks to lend significantly more with the same capital buffer,\" he said. Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Vince Cable's remarks are encouraging to all those who believe that access to finance still bedevils many new and growing companies across the UK. \"More can and must be done to increase the responsiveness of our banking system to the needs of the real economy. As our own research shows, banks still face significant challenges in reconnecting with many businesses. Greater competition, more proportionate regulatory requirements and the rebuilding of relationships and trust all have a role to play.\" Marshall said the business bank should be \"radically scaled up\" and added: \"It must get closer to UK businesses and their needs, and have the ability to work directly with companies in some instances if it is to become a truly game-changing institution. Scaling up and strengthening the business bank must be a top priority in future years, no matter who forms Britain's next government.\"",
