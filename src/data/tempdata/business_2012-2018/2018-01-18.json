      "bodyText": "Battersea Power Station is to be sold for \u00a31.6bn in one of Britain\u2019s largest ever property deals. Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), alongside Employees Provident Fund of Malaysia, have announced their intention to purchase the Grade II listed building, Battersea Power Station Development Company said in a statement on Thursday. The \u00a31.6bn sale will transfer ownership of Battersea Power Station, but not the 42 acre site around the building, overtaking the \u00a31.28bn paid by Chinese investors for the Walkie Talkie building in London last year. Development is continuing at the mixed use regeneration project, which will include retail and leisure units, commercial space, and 250 apartments, which have already been sold. A company source insisted that the deal with the Malaysian investors is not linked to reported financial difficulties on the project, but rather a benefit of Apple\u2019s decision to base their UK headquarters in the former coal-fired power station\u2019s central boiler house from 2021, which has guaranteed a future income stream. The project\u2019s current affordable housing provision would be unaffected by the proposed deal, the source added, which was slashed from 636 homes to just 386 last year, amounting to 9% of the planned homes in the Battersea Power Station redevelopment project. Building projects across London have faced rising constructions costs as a result of the drop in the value of sterling after the Brexit vote, and increased difficulties in attracting skilled labourers. After the proposed deal was announced on the Malaysian stock exchange, a BPSDC spokesperson said: \u201cThe Battersea Power Station building would provide both investors with a unique investment opportunity to own an iconic development in the heart of London. \u201cWith the conclusion of the proposed transaction, BPSDC will remain the active manager of the development. This creates a solid platform that will ensure the protection, active management and control of the historically important building are maintained.\u201d Battersea Power Station opened in 1933, but the generator was not completed until 1953 after construction was delayed by the second world war. The power station generated 20% of London\u2019s electricity supply at its peak, until it stopped producing power in 1983. \u201cThe Malaysian shareholders purchased the site in September 2012 and have since made significant progress including the successful completion of the first phase of the development which is now home to over 1,000 residents and a collection of independent retailers and restaurateurs,\u201d a BPSDC spokesperson added. \u201cThe proposed new [financial] structure will not affect the shareholdings of Sime Darby Property, S P Setia and EPF in the Battersea Project Holding Company (the joint venture company which is the holding company of the Battersea project).\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The leader of the Liberal Democrats expressed \u201cdisgust\u201d that passages of a damning report by the Financial Conduct Authority had not been released, four-and-a-half years after he first referred the case to the regulator during his time in the coalition government. The FCA published most of its report into RBS\u2019s global restructuring group (GRG), which is alleged to have driven small firms to the wall in pursuit of profit, but left out a section about the bank\u2019s management team. Cable used parliamentary privilege to name former RBS employee Nathan Bostock \u2013 who is now chief executive of Santander UK \u2013 as one of the bankers \u201cresponsible\u201d for a policy that unpublished passages of the report allege management would, or should, have known would lead to the mistreatment of customers. \u201cIf the reported passage from the full report is correct, then questions have to be raised over the management who were responsible for GRG. The FCA must also then disclose who they think is responsible,\u201d he added. Labour MP Clive Lewis called for the public debate in parliament on Thursday over the issues at the bank, which first arose several years ago. Ahead of the debate, the Treasury committee published a memo called \u201cJust Hit Budget!\u201d sent to GRG staff in 2009 and released by the bank to MPs. The memo referred to struggling companies \u2013 many of which had been damaged by the banking crisis \u2013 as \u201cbasket cases\u201d, while staff were told in a section of the memo headed \u201cRope\u201d that: \u201cSometimes you need to let customers hang themselves.\u201d Treasury minister John Glen said he would \u201cstop at nothing\u201d to help small businesses \u201cfailed\u201d by RBS and other banks, while Nicky Morgan, the chairman of the Treasury select committee, warned information had to be \u201cdragged out of\u201d the bank. Lewis said the practices at GRG were perhaps the \u201clargest theft anywhere, ever\u201d, while MPs also heard that the unit was \u201cmore like an abattoir\u201d where firms were taken apart. A spokeswoman for RBS said the City watchdog confirmed that the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The FCA said it was supported in its decision not to release the passages of the report by an independent reviewer, Andrew Green QC. A spokesman for the GRG business action group, which represents 500 firms put into financial distress by the bank, said: \u201c[The] debate reveals the widespread and justified anger amongst politicians at the conduct of RBS\u2019s rogue bankers.

      "bodyText": "Primark is on track to overtake Next as the UK\u2019s second biggest clothing retailer this year after strong sales over the winter. Low prices, aviator jackets, children\u2019s clothing and new makeup ranges helped Primark outperform rivals \u2013 even though it does not sell online, the source of most sales growth in the sector. Sales rose 4% at Primark\u2019s UK stores open for more than a year in the 16 weeks to 6 January, analysts estimated. The clothing chain said it had benefited because it kept prices steady. Many rivals had increased prices in response to rising costs caused by the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. Kate Ormrod, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said Primark\u2019s strong end to 2017 in the UK, after 10% total domestic growth in its previous financial year, meant it was likely to overtake Next. Primark holds a 6.9% share of the clothing market by value, compared with Next at 7.1%. Marks &amp; Spencer remains the UK\u2019s biggest clothing retailer with an 8.1% share. \u201cThe clothing sector is polarised, as mid-market players such as Next, M&amp;S and Debenhams lose out to premium and value rivals, with Primark adept at capitalising on shoppers trading down,\u201d Ormrod said. All three chains are closing stores while Primark continues to expand. All of Next\u2019s growth over Christmas was online, where sales rose 13.6%; its high street stores suffered a 6.1% slump. In contrast, Primark plans to open 1.2m sq ft of space internationally this year. In the UK, it opened a store in Charlton, south London, and a larger outlet in Rotherham in November. The rise of the cut-price clothing chain mirrors the changes taking place in the grocery market where traditional supermarkets are losing share to discounters Aldi and Lidl. John Bason, the finance director of Primark\u2019s parent company, Associated British Foods (ABF), said the number of visitors to its UK stores had risen, and womenswear sales were up despite many of its rivals reporting a tough Christmas, particularly on the high street. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the merchandise and the prices we\u2019ve got,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no inflation across the piece.\u201d Primark performed significantly better in the UK than in the rest of Europe where analysts said sales fell up to 6% at established stores. Total sales for the group rose 7% as it opened 8% more space, suggesting an overall 1% fall at established stores over the period. Shares in ABF slid 3.6% on Thursday as analysts were disappointed by the poor performance in other European countries and a 12% fall in revenues at the group\u2019s sugar business amid falling prices for the commodity. The decline across much of the continent was partly caused by unseasonably warm weather in October in many countries. Sales at Primark\u2019s existing stores, particularly in the Netherlands, were also down because the retailer had opened more stores. Primark\u2019s strong performance bucks the trend in the UK as it does not sell goods online and so is missing out on the shift to home deliveries. Total non-food retail sales fell 1.4% nationwide in the three months to 30 December, according to the monthly British Retail Consortium and KPMG sales monitor, the lowest since March 2009. Online sales of non-food rose 6.2%. Primark\u2019s website and social media activity play a key role in tempting shoppers into stores, according to Bason. The company has 11 million followers, nearly half of whom are on Instagram. Primark\u2019s social media following is rising rapidly as young people increasingly use their mobile phones to browse fashions before heading into stores. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

Inflation is running at 3% while wage rises can manage no more than 2.5%. Worse for the average household, the banks are beginning to turn off the lending taps that have allowed them to boost their incomes with cheap debt. Things were better in the year to April 2017, according to the number crunchers at the Office for National Statistics, who have lifted the lid on Britain\u2019s spending habits in their annual family spending report. It shows that average weekly household spending clawed its way back from the depths of the 2009 recession to exceed the pre-crisis level for the first time. This slice of good news, albeit five or six years later than many economists thought it would happen, disguises how the better off have thrived compared to those on the bottom rung of the income ladder. For instance the richest 10% spent more on wine per week (\u00a39.40) than the poorest 10% spent on water (\u00a37.30). In the same vein, the richest 10% spent \u00a359.40 on \u201cfurniture and furnishings, carpets and other floor coverings\u201d to almost match how much the poorest 10% spent on rent (\u00a362.70). Challenging the idea that the poorest waste their money on booze and cigarettes, the survey found that the richest 10% devote twice as much of the weekly shop (\u00a317.50) to \u201calcoholic drinks, tobacco and narcotics\u201d as the poorest. But it is the new rich, the 65- to 74-year-olds that really catch the eye. Their spending might not match that of the top 10%, yet it significantly powers ahead of anything the average 20-something can muster on areas like entertainment and recreation. The figures show that people in the 10 years from their 65th birthday go on a spending binge that means devoting nearly a fifth of their total expenditure on recreation and culture, double the 10% spent by the under-30s. This is the final salary pension bonanza that can only be described as a once in a generation spending boost. The same applies to those of all ages on below average incomes. They increased their spending by a startling 7% on the previous year, far more than the 1% increase across the richest half of households. Unfortunately they managed this largely by running down savings and taking on extra debt. As banks, under instruction from the financial regulator, rein in their lending, debt-fuelled spending should be considered a one-off boon, just like the final salary payout. However, that seems unlikely. Banks remain dependent for profit on lending. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Carillion crisis: UK banks offer help to small firms, as task force launched - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap of the main points. The government has set up a new national task force to tackle the Carillion crisis. Ministers, unions and business groups will work together to prevent a \u2018domino effect\u2019 rippling through the industry. The TUC say the government must protect jobs, transfer workers to new providers, bring contracts back in house, and urgently check the health of the rest of the sector. Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to rip up Britain\u2019s outsourcing rules: UK banks are falling over each other to announce support for customers suffering a financial hit from Carillion. Lloyds Banking Group led the way, launching a \u00a350m emergency fund this morning Royal Bank of Scotland then found \u00a375m, while HSBC is putting aside \u00a3100m So, no excuse for the banks not to help distressed customers... Nationwide has decided to put 250 Carillion workers onto its books, guaranteeing their jobs. It also hopes to reach deals with third-party suppliers that cleaned its building societies via Carillion, potentially protecting another 1,000 jobs Elsewhere.... MPs have lambasted Royal Bank of Scotland over the way it mistreated small business customers. UK household spending has reached pre-crisis levels again. Countrywide, Britain\u2019s largest estate agent, has posted a profits warning. Its shares have tumbled, closing down 18.6% Axing stamp duty for first-time buyers has not helped, say chartered surveyors. This is turning into a bidding war! HSBC have just told us they are going to provide up to \u00a3100m of support for its customers. Just in! Royal Bank of Scotland is creating a \u00a375m fund to help its business customers who have been caught up in the Carillion collapse. Hours after being criticised by MPs over its treatment of small firms in the past, RBS says it will do what it can to help in the current crisis. This includes providing payment holidays and assistance with their overdraft, for customers whose cashflows have been wrecked by Carillion\u2019s liquidation. The bank (majority owned by the taxpayer) says: We have over \u00a375m available to support impacted small businesses and will make more finance available if required to top up this fund. We will also support our Commercial customers on a case-by-case basis with their individual requirements. We have a proactive, principles-based approach that allows us to assist our customers when there are unexpected external circumstances. This support is available to customers banking with NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland. Les Matheson, CEO for Personal and Business Banking at RBS, is encouraging customers to get in touch if they need help. Opposition MPs are also pushing the UK government to explain how Carillion\u2019s pension deficit was allowed to swell in the run-up to its collapse. The FT\u2019s Josephine Cumbo has the details: The UK government is being pressed to explain why a funding shortfall at Carillion\u2019s pension scheme was allowed to widen before the construction group\u2019s collapse. Opposition politicians have written to the government and to the UK Pensions Regulator asking a series of questions about the shortfall, which nearly doubled from \u00a3317m in 2015 to \u00a3587m at the end of 2016. About 28,000 members of Carillion\u2019s 13 pension schemes face cuts to their retirement benefits, as payment of their pensions is taken over by the Pension Protection Fund, the industry fund that supports members of collapsed company schemes. Accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg say the UK tax authorities could help small businesses hurt by Carillion\u2019s collapse. The UK tax rules allow companies to claim VAT relief on unpaid bills -- but only six months after the money was due. Carillion made some suppliers wait 120 days for payment, so in a worst-case scenario a supplier might face a 10 month wait before they can reclaim VAT from the government. Daphne Hemingway, VAT Partner at Blick Rothenberg, says the \u201cIn this instance, perhaps HMRC should also look at reducing the wait time for obtaining a VAT refund, especially as the government is trying to get large corporations to deal more fairly with small and medium sized businesses when it comes to the payment of bills. Labour MP Pat McFadden is trying to get to the bottom of how Carillion lurched into liquidation on Monday morning. He\u2019s asked business secretary Greg Clark to answer 10 questions -- including how much the crisis will cost the taxpayer, and what discussions went on behind the scenes in recent weeks as Carillion tried to stay afloat. McFadden says: \u201cWe know that Carillion sought financial help from Government as it sought to put together a rescue package in recent weeks. It is essential that we know what exactly the company was asking for and how the cost of that compares to the potential costs facing the taxpayer from liquidation. Here\u2019s the full list of questions: Press reports indicate that the court statement lodged by Carillion CEO Keith Cochrane says that the company made at least one if approach if not more to the Government seeking financial help. (a) How many approaches did the company make in recent months? (b) When did they take place and what sums of money were discussed? How much was Carillion seeking from its lenders in the discussions which took place before liquidation? Was there any discussion between the Government and Carillion\u2019s banks about what would be needed from Government to avoid liquidation? If so, what was the sum of money being requested from Government? Was there an estimate made of the cost to the public purse of unwinding the business, the impact of liquidation on Carillion\u2019s thousands of sub-contractors, sorting out and re-tendering or selling the existing contracts and all the other associated costs which will now have to be paid? Again, if there was an estimate of these costs given to Ministers before the company went into liquidation, what was the figure involved? Did the Government make a comparison between the cost to the public purse of any financial help the company may have been seeking and the cost to the public purse which would arise from liquidation? Why was liquidation chosen as the path for wind up rather than administration? Did the Government make a cost comparison of these two options? If so, what were the estimates of the costs involved that the Government had before them? When will the official receiver report on their investigation into corporate governance, including changes to the company\u2019s renumeration scheme in 2016? Did Ministers or officials meet with the company\u2019s management and trade unions in the run up to liquidation? If so when and what was discussed? Did the Government appoint financial advisors to help it make decisions about this matter? If so, who were they? What process does the Government have in place for dealing with Carillion\u2019s thousands of sub-contractors, given the potential of a domino effect from the company\u2019s collapse? Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s response to the Carillion crisis goes beyond a mere task force. The Labour leader has vowed to rip up current procurement rules for outsourcing services, so that they would be run by the public sector by default. Speaking to the Guardian, Corbyn said the next Labour government would end the \u201cracket\u201d of outsourcing, pledging: \u201cWe will rewrite the rules to give the public back control of their services.\u201d Setting up a task force is the easy bit. Now the government, along with union leaders and business chiefs, must protect Carillion\u2019s workers, maintain public services outsourced to the group, and provide a helping hand to small firms who are suffering losses. The TUC says it will bring five demands to this afternoon\u2019s task force meeting: 1) the transfer of private sector contracts to alternative providers with jobs, pay and pensions protected; 2) a comprehensive support package for at-risk workers, apprentices and small firms; 3) protection for agency and zero-hours workers on Carillion contracts to ensure they can recover unpaid wages; 4) bringing Carillion\u2019s public-service contracts back in-house to ensure consistent delivery and certainty for workers; 5) an urgent risk assessment on other large outsourcing firms to avoid another crisis, and a moratorium on future outsourcing. NEWSFLASH: The Government is setting up a task force to help firms and workers hurt by the collapse of Carillion. The national task force will involve businesses, unions and the government, the Business Department has announced. It wil meet later today, to review the impact of Carillion\u2019s liquidation on Monday morning. A Business Department spokesman said the move was aimed at supporting and monitoring the impact on small businesses and workers. The TUC, which called for such a task force earlier this week, is pleased that the government has acted (although it has taken three days!) TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady says there\u2019s no time to lose: \u201cTime is of the essence in dealing with this crisis. We need urgent action to protect jobs, pay and pensions. This cannot be a talking shop.\u201d More to follow: Getting back to Carillion....and business secretary Greg Clark has applauded Lloyds for setting up a \u00a350m emergency fund to help small firms. He might even be trying to take some credit.... Another Labour MP, Kate Green, attacks RBS\u2019s failure to properly compensate customers who suffered from its GRG division. She says the bank has failed to provide proper information to claimants or the courts, making it harder for them to obtain redress. Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour MP, says she also has constituents whose businesses have been destroyed by UK banks. They have lost their homes, had their families torn apart, lost their health and their future They have been living a hand-to-mouth existence, just so some banker can receive their obscene bonus. Fresh questions were raised about Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s conduct yesterday, when an internal memo showed how staff at its Global Restructuring Group had been encouraged to put customers under pressure. Called \u201cJust Hit Budget!\u201d, the memo described struggling firms as \u201cbasket cases\u201d and urged staff to give customers enough rope to \u201chang themselves\u201d. Conservative MP Stephen Kerr says RBS showed a \u201ccontempt for small firms\u201d. Kerr actually joined RBS as a 16-year old, and he\u2019s disappointed that the bank\u2019s reputation has fallen so low since. He also blasts RBS\u2019s current CEO, Ross McEwan, for blaming a \u201cjunior\u201d manager for the Just Hit Budget! memo. Kerr says: Frankly, a junior bank manager would not have written this kind of document without understanding that it conformed to the culture of the business that they were operating in. I\u201dm afraid that the chief executive is condemned by his own justification, which frankly does not wash. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has told parliament that he is disgusted that the full report into Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s Global Restructuring Group has not been published. Cable also singled out one top UK banker, Nathan Bostock, who became RBS\u2019s Group Chief Risk Officer in 2009 but is now running Santander UK. Intervening in today\u2019s debate on GRG, Cable says: \u201cDoes the honourable gentleman share my disgust that four-and-a-half years after, as Secretary of State, I referred many of these cases [through] the Tomlinson report, to the FCA we still only have an interim report? Is he aware that the BBC have actually seen a copy of the final report, which contains the following incriminating phrase: \u201cmanagement knew, or should have known, that this was an intended and co-ordinated strategy and that the mistreatment of business customers was a result of that\u201d and that the head of GRG responsible for that policy, Mr Nathan Bostock, is now chief executive of Santander [UK]?\u201d Update: A spokeswoman for RBS has told us that the City watchdog, the FCA, has confirmed that the most serious allegations against the bank had not been upheld. The FCA said it was supported in its decision not to release the passages of the report by an independent reviewer, Andrew Green QC. More here: Another Conservative MP, Alister Jack, tells the House of Commons that he had experienced Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s \u201cdisgraceful and unscrupulous\u201d tactics for himself. After the financial crisis, he says,an RBS manager tried to force Jack\u2019s self-storage firm onto a new, more expensive loan - charging 6% over base rate, not the 1% he had been enjoying. RBS claimed that Jack\u2019s firm was breaching its agreement, because the value of its property had fallen by 40%. Jack disputed it -- and a valuation proved that it had actually doubled in value. They were livid....and after that they made things impossible for us. Over in parliament, MPs are debating how Royal Bank of Scotland treated small businesses who got into financial difficulties. Labour MP Clive Lewis says he didn\u2019t initially believe the stories told by constituents who said they had suffered from RBS\u2019s treatment. One, Andrew Gibbs, was forced to buy an interest-rate hedging product that was meant to protect his firm, but actually drained it of cash and led to its collapse. Many businesses were treated in an appalling way, Lewis claims. Some were put into RBS\u2019s Global Restructuring Group simply for complaining about their service. Another MP accused RBS of imposing \u2018gagging orders\u2019 on customers. Conservative MP William Wragg had a dire tale, of a joinery firm called Pickup and Bradbury which was placed into GRG\u2019s hands after RBS insisted on cutting its overdraft facility and saying it was owed \u00a3700,000. The firm collapsed, Wragg says, due to RBS\u2019s \u201caggressive repayment plans\u201d which didn\u2019t allow the company time to prove it was solvent. Wragg says RBS is guilty of crushing lives and livelihoods in its search for profits. He claimed: This was organised fraudulent asset-striping on a massive scale, leading to the forced liquidation of many, many businesses, which people have poured massive effort into and were their livelihoods. Newsflash: Lloyds Banking Group has set up a \u00a350m \u2018emergency fund\u2019 to help small businesses who have suffered losses from Carillion\u2019s collapse. The money is meant to help SMEs avoid being driven to the wall because they are owed money by Carillion, or were expecting to carry out work for the company. Lloyds is offering to waiving upfront arrangement fees on overdrafts and invoice finance facilities to existing customers. It could also offer \u201ccapital repayment holidays on existing loans\u201d for six month, for firms in the greatest difficulties. Lloyds adds: Customers will also be able to use the fund to extend or draw new invoice discounting or factoring products, free of arrangement fees. The Group\u2019s support will also include guidance on working capital requirements to help firms unlock cash so they can manage their way through the difficulties they currently face. Many previously healthy small firms have suddenly found themselves in real financial difficulties due to Carillion\u2019s liquidation. Jo Harris, Lloyd\u2019s managing director for business banking, says the bank understands that small companies often don\u2019t have the resources to cope with a significant loss of income. She explains: \u201cSmall businesses don\u2019t normally have the cash reserves that larger businesses do, so any interruption to their cashflow can have a significant impact on their ability to survive. By supporting our small business customers during this difficult time, we hope we can help as many businesses as possible to get back on an even keel as quickly as possible.\u201d Carillion\u2019s collapse is a big blow to hundreds of apprentices employed by the firm, or by companies it contracted to help on construction projects. Work has been suspended at several building sites, such as the Lincoln Eastern Bypass, creating, leaving workers in the lurch. The Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) has now launched a new helpline and email address for former Carillion apprentices to get in touch, and for construction employers who are interested in helping them. The helpline is 0344 994 4010 and carillion.apprenticeshipsupport@citb.co.uk. Carillion ran training centres across England and Scotland, including at Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, Sunderland, Sittingbourne and Southampton. The CITB hopes to get apprentices back on the job, learning crucial skills like bricklaying and carpentry and joinery. Sarah Beale, chief executive of the CITB, says: \u201cOur industry, which has consistently reported skill shortages and difficulties in attracting apprentices, now needs to step up and support these young people who have so much to offer. There is certainly no shortage of work in construction, with housebuilding and infrastructure particularly strong, so these young people can have great careers despite this setback. Nationwide\u2019s decision means that most of the Carillion staff employed on private sector have some certainty over their future. That\u2019s because, as of yesterday, nine in ten of the private companies who employed Carillion to provide services had pledged to keep paying the Official Receiver - at least in the short term while the liquidation is carried out. But their long-term future is less clear. Labour MP Rebecca Long Bailey, Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, says the government needs to do more: \u201cIt is welcome that 90% of Carillion\u2019s private sector contractors have suggested that they will continue to pay staff. However, this is just for the interim period and due to the Government\u2019s failure to think long-term, the future is still not certain for most workers. \u201cThis concession has not been the result of any real Government intervention. Apart from meeting a few banks to find a quick fix to a long-term problem, the Government has failed to stop small businesses from going under. \u201cThe collapse of Carillion is a disaster for small businesses. Many now face missing out on unpaid fees which may well go back several months along with a damaging loss of business.\u201d The Green Party\u2019s former leader, Natalie Bennett, says Nationwide\u2019s decision shows that Carillion wasn\u2019t actually providing much value. Here\u2019s some early reaction to the news that Nationwide is taking on Carillion staff: In a dramatic reversal of decades of outsourcing, Nationwide Building Society is going to in-source all the Carillion employees who were working for Nationwide. They are believed to number around 250 workers, such as maintenance engineers in its data centres and reception and security staff. In a statement, Nationwide said: \u201cOur contractors perform a vital and valued role for the society. During an unsettling time for Carillion employees we felt it was important to provide them with some reassurances. \u201cWe are today announcing a proposal to bring all services provided directly by Carillion in-house, with Carillion employees becoming Nationwide employees from 22 January. This will provide clarity for those affected and ensure that services are maintained.\u201d Carillion was also indirectly responsible for more than 1,000 cleaners at Nationwide\u2019s 650-strong branch network, where it had itself outsourced the work to third parties. Nationwide says it will now contract directly with these third parties, which should protect those jobs too. It says: \u201cAs part of the wider supply chain arrangements we will also now look to deal directly with third-party suppliers that currently support the Carillion contract.\u201d The household spending survey also shows that Britons spent more on recreation and culture last year, mainly due to increased spending on package holidays. That\u2019s despite the fact that wages didn\u2019t rise in line with earnings. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, says people need to be careful.... It\u2019s surprising to see how many of us are spending on non-essential things like eating out and holidays. Families are still splashing the cash on package holidays and travel despite the fall in the pound after the Brexit vote. If you\u2019re starting to feel the pinch, now is the time to take a serious look at where you\u2019re spending your money. Make a budget and stick to it, when you look back at bank statements you may be surprised how much you\u2019re actually spending on non-essential items. Getting a hold on your fun money is key.\u201d The ONS have also produced this chart, showing where households spent their money last year: Newsflash: UK household spending has finally returned to its levels before the financial crisis. The Office for National Statistics reports that the average household spent \u00a3554.20 per week in 2017. In real terms (ie, adjusted for inflation) this is a return to pre-economic downturn levels. The survey also shows that transport takes the biggest slice of household spending. The average household spending \u00a379.70 a week on transport costs (either buying a car, running it, or paying for public transport). Here\u2019s more details: Households in the 65-to-74-year-old age group spent nearly a fifth of their total spending on recreation and culture. Households without children spent a higher proportion of their total spending on transport than households with children. Average weekly spending of a 15-year-old was more than three times that of a 7-year-old. Economist Rupert Seggins has also been analysing the RICS housing report: Ouch! Britain\u2019s largest estate agency has issued an unexpected profits warning, sending its shares slumping. Countrywide, which owns a string of estate agents around the UK, reported that revenues and profits both fell sharply last year. The company blames a \u201cdisappointing\u201d performance in the final three months of 2017 -- another sign that the government\u2019s changes to stamp duty haven\u2019t stimulated the market. Countrywide, whose brands include Taylors, Hamptons and Gascoigne-Pees, now expects to post earnings of \u00a365m for 2017 -- down from \u00a383.5m in 2016. Shares in the company have slumped by 16% this morning. In a statement to the City, Countrywide says that revenue from house sales and rentals both fell last year. Here\u2019s the details: Total income in the sales and lettings business for the full year is expected to be circa \u00a3360m, down 14% on 2016, reflecting a disappointing fourth quarter performance. Income in the UK business is expected to be circa \u00a3205m, down 17% year on year, and in London is expected to be circa \u00a3155m, down 10% year on year. Lettings income is expected to be down 4% at circa \u00a3169m, driven by an 8% decline in the UK, with London lettings revenue flat year on year. Today\u2019s report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) also shows that fewer people have been making inquiries about buying a house. Here\u2019s City economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon on the RICS housing report: Surveyors based in London are more optimistic about the stamp duty change. RICS says that 28% believe abolishing the tax will help first-time buyers (compared to just 12% nationally). That\u2019s probably because houses in the capital are so expensive, so stamp duty has a bigger impact on prices. Brian Murphy, head of lending for Mortgage Advice Bureau (MAB), explains: In London, more than double the number of surveyors felt that it would have a beneficial impact on the market than those of outside London. Of course, this is reflective of the value of property in the Capital, where those purchasing for the first time can expect to save up to \u00a35,000 under the new scheme. Oldman-based surveyor Richard Powell of Ryder &amp; Dutton says there\u2019s no sign that abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers has helped: The stamp duty changes didn\u2019t seem to have an immediate effect so we will have to see what happens in the early part of 2018. Stock levels are very low. Stephen Gadsby, of Gadsby Nichols in Derby, agrees: Usual seasonal downturn in enquiry levels, instructions and sales. Very little impact as a result of stamp duty changes but too soon to tell due to time of year. Philip Hiatt of Your Move in East Grinstead, reckons the wintery weather deterred people from popping into their estate agents last month: [The market was] seasonally quiet and snowy weather also had an impact. Stamp duty change for FTB\u2019s so far has had little impact. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, business and the eurozone. The UK government\u2019s latest attempt to help first-time buyers onto the housing market are failing. A new survey of Britain\u2019s chartered surveyors shows that that axing stamp duty for many first time buyers \u2018has failed to increase house sales\u2019. Instead existing home owners seem to have taken advantage of the move, and pushed their prices up instead. RICS has reported this morning that the number of inquiries from new buyers actually dipped in December - after chancellor Philip Hammond announced the immediate abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers, for all properties up to \u00a3300,00. That stamp duty cut was one of the headline-grabbing moves in the budget, designed to lower the barriers to buying a new house. But 86% of the surveyors reckon it hasn\u2019t had any impact at all yet. Simon Rubinsohn, RICS Chief Economist says: \u201cThe initial feedback from the market doesn\u2019t suggest that the change in the Stamp Duty regime announced in the budget is going to have a material impact on activity. Indeed, the risk was always that a good portion of the benefit would be capitalised in the price, therefore limiting the benefit for the first-time buyer. Two-thirds of surveyors reckon the abolishment of stamp duty for first time buyers will have \u201clittle consequence\u201d, while just 12% felt it would result in higher overall activity. It\u2019s a disappointing finding. Not unexpected, though -- Britain\u2019s budget watchdog warned at the time that it wouldn\u2019t work. It highlights just how hard it is for younger people to get onto the housing ladder, given the price acceleration over the last decade. Surveyors also report there is a \u201clack of momentum\u201d in the housing market at the moment. I\u2019ll pull together some more details now. Also coming up today We\u2019ll be watching the Carillion crisis, as unions demand more protection for thousands of workers on its private sector contracts. Economists are digesting new Chinese growth figures, which show that annual growth ticked up to 6.9% last year. That\u2019s a little stronger than forecast. In the City, Whitbread, Royal Mail and Halfords are reporting results: Most European stock markets are expected to rise this morning, but London might lag behind: And later today, MPs will discuss Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s treatment of its small business customers. It should be a bruising debate; yesterday, a memo from 2009 showed that RBS staff were told to let small businesses \u201chang themselves\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "High street banks have made more than \u00a3225m available to help businesses put at risk by the failure of Carillion, while companies have offered to take on staff who were working for the firm when it collapsed into receivership. A taskforce of banks, businesses and construction industry trade bodies met with the business secretary on Thursday to discuss ways to contain the impact of Carillion\u2019s collapse on jobs and the wider economy. Greg Clark convened the meeting amid pressure from trade unions to ensure that the business world helps limit job losses among former Carillion staff and employees in its supply chain. As the meeting broke up, banks announced more than \u00a3225m worth of emergency support to help small business customers ride out the crisis, including waivers on overdraft fees and loan repayment holidays. Clark, who urged banks to provide support at a separate meeting held on Wednesday, said: \u201cI welcome this quick and positive move by banks including Lloyds, HSBC and RBS. This follows my meeting with the banks yesterday where I challenged them to see what further support they could provide for SMEs affected by Carillion\u2019s insolvency. \u201cIt is essential that small businesses exposed are given the support they need by their lenders, and I look forward to other banks following suit.\u201d The lifeline comes after several of Carillion\u2019s subcontractors began laying off staff, sparking fears for the survival of some of its estimated 30,000 suppliers, owed hundreds of millions of pounds between them. Lloyds Banking Group, which was bailed out with \u00a320bn of taxpayers\u2019 money during the financial crisis, moved first to set up a \u00a350m emergency fund to help affected businesses. Royal Bank of Scotland, which required a \u00a345.5bn bailout during the crash, offered \u00a375m, while HSBC outgunned both with a \u00a3100m fund. Santander UK also offered support but did not place a value on it, while a Barclays spokesperson said the bank would \u201clook at\u201d increasing overdrafts, reducing loan repayments and helping firms with cashflow problems. Former clients of Carillion have also moved to take on some of its staff who were employed on contracts to provide services such as cleaning, catering and maintenance. British Gas owner Centrica, and Nationwide building society vowed to ensure former Carillion employees would continue to be paid or in some cases employed directly. Meanwhile, banks and businesses took part in a meeting at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to discuss ways to contain the fallout from Carillion. A BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cWe have created a taskforce to continue to support and monitor the impact on small businesses and employees who have been affected by Carillion\u2019s insolvency. \u201cThe taskforce will comprise representatives from business, construction trade associations, the trade unions, lenders and government.\u201d The Trades Union Congress, which has pushed for a crisis coalition of businesses and trade unions to deal with the Carillion fallout, said its general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, would present demands designed to protect workers. These will include: measures to transfer Carillion staff to new employers and protect their pay; bringing public sector contracts back under government control; a risk assessment of other large outsourcing firms and a moratorium on awarding further public service contracts to rival companies. O\u2019Grady said: \u201cWe are pleased the government has agreed to union calls for a national taskforce to deal with the collapse of Carillion. \u201cTime is of the essence in dealing with this crisis. We need urgent action to protect jobs, pay and pensions. This cannot be a talking shop.\u201d As the government stepped up efforts to limit the impact of Carillion\u2019s collapse, several of the firm\u2019s former clients said they would ensure staff continue to be paid. Nationwide said it would directly employ 250 people who had been working for the company on a contract held by Carillion. A further 1,500 staff who were working for third-party subcontractors will now be contracted to Nationwide. \u201cOur contractors perform a vital and valued role for the society. During an unsettling time for Carillion employees we felt it was important to provide them with some reassurances,\u201d said a spokesperson. Centrica said it would make funds available to the government\u2019s Insolvency Service to ensure that 480 staff who helped manage facilities at its buildings would continue to be paid. National Grid, which used Carillion staff on its infrastructure programme, said work would continue on an overhead line between Richborough and Canterbury, which is designed to connect a Belgium-UK power cable to the grid, and a power cable at Wylfa in Wales for the planned new nuclear power station there. A spokesperson said: \u201cNational Grid has contingency plans in place for all its projects with Carillion, using alternative suppliers if necessary. We believe that these plans mean we will be able to keep any disruption to a minimum.\u201d The company did not say whether it would take on any Carillion staff or whether it had provided funding to ensure they continue to be paid. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a criminal investigation into alleged money laundering, bribery and corruption at the grenade and ammunition manufacturer Chemring, one of its subsidiaries and individuals associated with the businesses. Chemring, based in Romsey, Hampshire, designs and makes products such as decoys, flares, detonators and grenades. It also develops systems to protect aircraft and ships against missiles, and sensor equipment to detect improvised explosive devices. The investigation comes after Chemring Technology Solutions (CTSL) handed its own report to the SFO. The SFO said its investigation would examine the \u201cconduct of business by Chemring Group and CTSL including \u2026 officers, employees, agents and persons\u201d. It declined to comment further during a live investigation. The company said the voluntary report compiled by CTSL related to two historic contracts. In a note in the company\u2019s full-year results, released on Thursday, it added there were concerns involving intermediaries \u201cwho previously represented\u201d CTSL and its \u201cpredecessor companies\u201d. The first contract was awarded before Chemring took over the business \u2013 now known as CTSL \u2013 while the second took place in 2011. Chemring said neither of the two incidents were \u201cconsidered to be material in the context of the group\u201d. It added it was too early to determine the outcome of the SFO\u2019s investigation but said it was fully co-operating with authorities and would provide further updates \u201cwhen appropriate\u201d. Details of the inquiry were announced as Chemring released its full-year results, showing a 15% rise in revenue to \u00a3547.5m for the 12 months ending October 31. Underlying operating profit rose 14% to \u00a355.4m, as a result of an improvement in \u201cconsistency of production\u201d and better manufacturing yields as the firm pushes ahead with a restructuring programme that has included closing and merging some of its manufacturing facilities. Statutory pre-tax profits, however, were down 50% to \u00a34m after accounting for exceptional items, including costs of acquisitions and disposals, restructuring and impairments. The Serious Fraud Office refused to comment beyond its statement.

The government issued guidance on Thursday that it said would ensure seafarers, people who are based on vessels as opposed to fixed installations such as oil platforms, receive the minimum wage. But the RMT union said the guidance only applied to UK waters out to a 12-mile limit, which would not cover most oil and gas activity. One firm decommissioning the BP Miller platform had workers on 12-hour shifts for $45, or about \u00a32.70 an hour, the union said. A second contractor reportedly paid similar rates on Canadian Natural Resources\u2019 Murchison platform. The minimum wage is \u00a37.50 for over-25s. The concern is international crews are being paid unfairly low rates and undercutting opportunities for UK workers. \u201cThis is an issue which to my mind is a national disgrace,\u201d said Jake Molloy, a regional organiser for the RMT. \u201cThis change [today] will do nothing to protect our members, or the exploitation of foreign nationals by the oil and gas industry, nothing,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "The A380 superjumbo has been thrown a lifeline after its biggest customer, Emirates, agreed to buy up to 36 more planes from Airbus. The European airplane manufacturer had warned that without the deal, which had been long in the negotiation, it might have to close down its A380 production line. The deal is the first large order for the world\u2019s biggest passenger aircraft in more than four years. Emirates has committed to buy 20 planes, with an option for 16 more, in a deal that would be worth up to $16bn (\u00a311.5bn) at list prices, although the Gulf airline will have negotiated a substantial discount. Fears for the future of the A380 had intensified after an anticipated order failed to materialise at the Dubai air show in November, with Emirates instead signing a deal with Boeing for 40 of the US manufacturer\u2019s 787 Dreamliners. Emirates has virtually single-handedly kept the A380 going: the latest deal means more than half of the planes ordered \u2013 178 out of 353 \u2013 are operating in or destined for the Gulf. The airline firm took delivery of its first A380 in July 2008, and its 100th two months ago. Announcing the agreement on Thursday, Emirates\u2019 chief executive and chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that the A380 has been a success for Emirates. Our customers love it, and we\u2019ve been able to deploy it on different missions across our network, giving us flexibility in terms of range and passenger mix.\u201d Emirates will replace some of its older A380s with the new planes. Airbus said the deal would allow it to continue producing the A380 for at least another decade. John Leahy, its long serving sales boss, who had been chasing one last big deal before retirement, said: \u201cI\u2019m personally convinced more orders will follow Emirates\u2019 example and that this great aircraft will be built well into the 2030s.\u201d The aircraft is built across Europe, with its wings manufactured in the UK at Broughton in Flintshire. Rolls-Royce is also a major supplier of engines, while landing gear and some of the avionics are also UK-built. While Thursday\u2019s order will give some reassurance to Airbus and its suppliers, questions remain about its flagship plane. In the autumn one of its A380s was taken out of service and mothballed in the Pyrenees, with its owner, a German leasing company, unable to find an airline willing to operate it. It is still more than two years since an airline other than Emirates has purchased an A380. The capacity of the double-decker plane, which can typically accommodate 575 passengers, meant it was seen at its inception as a way of allowing congested hub airports to increase passenger numbers. But the growing range of smaller, alternative planes such as the Dreamliner or Airbus\u2019s A350 has dented sales of the A380. Despite its popularity with many passengers who have travelled on it, only 13 airlines have so far flown the A380 and many have predicted its demise \u2013 not least, with some glee, Boeing. Airbus has twice cut the production rate of the plane in recent years, now down to eight planes annually, although executives recently indicated as few as six would be a sustainable rate. Overall, the European manufacturer has seen more success in the rapid sales of its smaller, single-aisle planes in the last year, particularly the A320neo. Airbus last week said that with a rush of December sales it had taken orders for 1,109 planes in total in 2017, again outstripping Boeing\u2019s 912 orders. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "webTitle": "Donald Trump is hampering fight against climate change, WEF warns", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The World Economic Forum delivered a strong warning about Donald Trump\u2019s go-it-alone approach to tackling climate change as it highlighted the growing threat of environmental collapse in its annual assessment of the risks facing the international community. In the run-up to the US president\u2019s speech to its annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, next week, the WEF avoided mentioning Trump by name but said \u201cnation-state unilateralism\u201d would make it harder to tackle global warming and ecological damage. The WEF\u2019s global risks perception survey showed Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House in 2017 had coincided with a marked increase in concern about the environment among experts polled by the Swiss-based organisation. It said all five environmental risks covered by the survey \u2013 extreme weather events, natural disasters, failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, and human-made natural disasters \u2013 had become more prominent. \u201cThis follows a year characterised by high-impact hurricanes, extreme temperatures and the first rise in CO2 emissions for four years. We have been pushing our planet to the brink and the damage is becoming increasingly clear. \u201cBiodiversity is being lost at mass-extinction rates, agricultural systems are under strain, and pollution of the air and sea has become an increasingly pressing threat to human health.\u201d Trump has threatened to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris agreement under which nations agreed to take steps to limit the increase in global temperature. He has said the commitments made by his predecessor, Barack Obama, would damage the American economy. Other states have said they will keep to the pledges made in Paris, an approach supported by the WEF. \u201cA trend towards nation-state unilateralism may make it more difficult to sustain the long-term, multilateral responses that are required to counter global warming and the degradation of the global environment,\u201d it said. The survey said the extreme weather events in 2017 included unusually frequent Atlantic hurricanes, with September the most intense month on record. It was also the most expensive hurricane season. It added that when data was finalised, 2017 would be among the three hottest years on record, and the hottest without an El Ni\u00f1o, the Pacific Ocean climate cycle that affects the world\u2019s weather. Biodiversity loss was occurring at mass-extinction rates, the WEF said, noting that the populations of vertebrate species declined by an estimated 58% between 1970 and 2012. \u201cGlobally, the primary driver of biodiversity loss is the human destruction of habitats including forests \u2013 which are home to approximately 80% of the world\u2019s land-based animals, plants and insects \u2013 for farming, mining, infrastructure development and oil and gas production.\u201d Stronger than expected growth in 2017 meant economic risks were seen as less pressing, but the WEF said the upbeat picture masked continuing underlying concerns, including unsustainable asset prices; high levels of indebtedness, particularly in China; and continuing strains in the global financial system. The International Monetary Fund is likely to raise its forecast for global growth when it gives its latest economic update in Davos next Monday, and the WEF survey said the recovery underway in all major economies had to led to a sharp improvement in sentiment. But it expressed concern that the swing to optimism might lead to complacency and a blind spot to economic risks. \u201cThere are certainly reasons to be cautious: one does not have to look far for signs of economic and financial strain\u201d, the WEF added, calling for greater attention to be paid to the risks of another crisis erupting. The survey warned there would be limited policy firepower in the event of a new crisis. It also warned of the disruption caused by automation, noting that \u201cfor the foreseeable future, automation and digitalisation can be expected to push down on levels of employment and wages, and contribute to increases in income and wealth at the top of the distribution.\u201d It also highlighted the buildup of protectionist pressures against a backdrop of rising nationalist and populist politics and growing cybersecurity risks. The WEF said cyber attacks against businesses had almost doubled in five years, and that the financial impact of cybersecurity breaches was rising.",

      "bodyText": "Spending by British households has returned to its pre-financial crisis levels in real terms, driven by purchases of cars and spending by older consumers on package holidays and pets. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed average weekly spending in the UK rose to \u00a3554.20 in the financial year ending March 2017, an increase from \u00a3533 the previous year. Transport and recreation were the two categories where expenditure increased the most, rising by about \u00a35 on average per week. Taking into account spending before and after the Brexit vote, the latest figures are an eye-opening reminder of the spending power of the older generation, versus the tough economic times for younger households \u2013 who are likely to be the first group in modern times to be poorer than their parents. Spending on recreation and culture among the under 30s was almost half that of those between 65 and 74, who shelled out almost a fifth of their disposable income on this category. Statisticians said pets, pet food, and package holidays were among their most popular purchases. The figures also illustrate buoyant economic conditions just before inflation started to outpace wage growth in the wake of the EU referendum, when a fall in the pound pushed up the cost of importing goods to Britain. Levels of consumer spending have since started to slow on average. Last year\u2019s rise in spending also outstripped growth in disposable income over the course of the year, with expenditure increasing by 4% as the amount of money available for people to spend rose by 2.3%. Poorer households have been harder hit by rising prices, according to the Resolution Foundation, which found spending increased by 7% for lower income families, while rose by only 1% for the richest half. Stephen Clarke, policy analyst at the thinktank, said: \u201cThis extra spending outpaced the extra level of income available to households, who turned instead to their savings and credit cards.\u201d Transport expenditure was the biggest single category for average weekly spending, at \u00a379.70 per week, with the running costs of vehicles \u2013 such as petrol, diesel and repairs \u2013 taking up the biggest proportion from this category. The ONS said it had seen a big increase in the use of car finance deals \u2013 something which has worried the Bank of England amid rapid growth of personal debt to levels unseen since the 2008 financial crisis. Recreation and culture was the second highest category for average spending for the first time since comparable records began in 2000, at \u00a373.50 per week. Housing and fuel ranked third, at \u00a372.60 per week. However, officials do not include mortgage payments, council tax and insurance in calculations, which would have made housing the top category, with average weekly spending of about \u00a3173.40, up from \u00a3164.70 a year ago. The government has now been tracking spending habits for 60 years, helping to show how British culture has shifted from the late 1950s to the present day. Tobacco accounted for about 6% of total spending in 1957, although now only represents 1% of all purchases, mirroring the fall in the number of people who smoke. Expenditure on food and clothes has halved since 1957 from 33% to 16% and 10% to 5% respectively, which the ONS said could be down to greater levels of consumer choice and falling average household sizes. Robynne Davies, senior ONS statistician, said average weekly spending last year varied considerably across the country, with more than \u00a3200 difference between the highest and lowest spending areas. Average weekly spending was highest in London at \u00a3643.70 per week, set against the lowest levels in the north east of \u00a3437 per week. \u201cThe increases [by category] are across the board, but it\u2019s also on more discretionary items such as recreation and culture and hotels,\u201d she added. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest coffee shop chain, Costa Coffee, has suffered a fall in sales at its high street stores and warned consumer demand would remain \u201csubdued\u201d. Costa\u2019s owner, Whitbread, said like-for-like sales at its UK outlets had fallen 1.5% in the 13 weeks to 30 November. Costa Express machines, which are mainly in petrol stations and convenience stores, fared much better, with 6.7% underlying sales growth. The Whitbread chief executive, Alison Brittain, said like some highstreet retailers Costa had been hit by a decline in consumers, partly caused by a \u201cstructural shift to online shopping\u201d. But she insisted this did not mean the end of the coffee shop boom. \u201cI\u2019m a great optimist \u2026 that people do like to socialise with each other. In the old days this would have been the pub environment,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think coffee drinking and quality coffee drinking is in any danger of going backwards.\u201d In light of the difficulties on the high street, the company is focusing on opening more coffee shops in drivethroughs and other travel locations, as well as rolling out more Express machines. Costa is serving more hot food, including chicken and chorizo rice boxes and egg muffins for breakfast, and has just launched a range of coffee with coconut milk. Excluding new stores, Costa\u2019s overall UK sales dipped 0.1% in the quarter, marking only the second time they have ever fallen. The first decline was in the quarter to February last year, when they dropped by 0.8%. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at the financial spreadbetting firm ETX Capital, said: \u201cThe drop in Costa sales seems to be down to shoppers shunning the high street, resulting in lower footfall for stores, as well as pressure from the artisan coffee retailers who are gaining market share. \u201cAt present it does not appear that higher-margin finer coffee products as well as the newly launched Cold Brew and Frostino lines are helping to improve sales and margins.\u201d Costa has 1,357 high street stores, 1,032 franchise stores and 7,100 Express machines in the UK. The figures came after reports that the activist fund Sachem Head, which has built a 3.4% stake in Whitbread, was calling for the company to spin off Costa. The company has joined Wagamama, JD Wetherspoon and All Bar One in ditching plastic straws. The decision follows Theresa May\u2019s pledge to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste within 25 years. Costa uses 19m plastic straws a year and 26m stroons \u2013 straws with spoons on the end. They will be phased out this year and replaced with a non-plastic alternative. Disposable cups are harder to tackle. Brittain said the company was working \u201cvery hard\u201d with the rest of the industry and local processing plants on recycling all drinks containers that are thrown away on the high street. Costa has ramped up its own recycling of disposable cups and is now recycling 12m a year, out of nearly 200m sold. Every Costa store now offers recycling. The chain is also offering a 25p discount to customers bringing in a reusable cup. Whitbread\u2019s budget hotel chain Premier Inn posted slower UK like-for-like sales growth of 0.5% after a tough October. It explained it had sold rooms cheaply in advance, rather than filling them later at a higher price. Wilson said Premier Inn was probably under pressure from the rise of Airbnb and similar ventures, adding: \u201cGiven the weakness in sterling and increase in UK tourist spending, Premier Inn arguably should be doing better.\u201d Whitbread is rolling out Premier Inn in Germany, where it faces less competition in the branded hotel sector. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

The Bureau of Statistics has released its employment data for December, completing the picture for jobs growth in 2017. The data show 403,100 jobs were created last year, in seasonally adjusted terms, as the economy recorded its 15th consecutive monthly gain in employment, matching the record set in June 1995 when Australia was recovering from the early 1990s recession. The majority of the new jobs were full-time positions (303,400 positions, worth 75%). By the end of the year, the strength of the jobs market was encouraging more people back into the labour force to actively look for work, leading the participation rate in December to jump from 65.5% to 65.7%. The increase in the participation rate meant the official unemployment rate actually increased slightly in December, from 5.4% to 5.5%, but economists say that increase should not be interpreted negatively. \u201cThese are exceptionally good figures,\u201d the independent economist Saul Eslake said. \u201cThe absolute increase in jobs over the course of 2017 was the largest on record. In percentage terms, at 3.4%, it\u2019s the biggest since 1994.\u201d However, despite the strong employment figures in 2017, the anaemic pace of wages growth is unlikely to pick up in 2018. That\u2019s because the underemployment rate (8.3%) and underutilisation rate (13.7%) remain stubbornly high. \u201cWith 5.5% unemployment, with what is still a considerable margin of underemployment on top of that, indicates there\u2019s still a fair bit of slack in the labour market, so it would be a leap to say these figures mean an uptick in wages growth is just around the corner,\u201d Eslake said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly consistent with the idea that we shouldn\u2019t see any further slowing in wages growth.\u201d The job creation in 2017 was driven heavily by two industries: healthcare and construction. The JP Morgan economist Tom Kennedy has previously said the acceleration in employment and participation in the healthcare sector was the result of hiring and participation spillovers related to the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, while the construction industry benefited from home-building and government infrastructure cycles. Kennedy said the rollout of the NDIS has had a noticeable impact on women\u2019s participation, given the healthcare and social assistance sector is so female-dominated. Bureau of Statistics figures show the participation rate for women is now at a record high of 60.4%, in trend terms. Kennedy posits that since an increasing number of NDIS providers are taking more of the care load, it has allowed informal care-givers (who are typically women) who had previously left the labour force to care for family members to begin re-entering the labour force in increasing numbers to look for paid employment. Malcolm Turnbull was quick to trumpet the employment figures on Thursday, during his visit to Japan. \u201cWhat a great jobs number today,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThis is the equal to the longest run of consecutive monthly jobs increases since 1978. The participation rate is at the highest level in seven years, and we\u2019ve seen consumer confidence at the highest level since November 2013. \u201cSo jobs and growth. A slogan in 2016, a big outcome this year.\u201d Brendan O\u2019Connor, the shadow employment minister, said Turnbull may trumpet the employment numbers, but with 730,600 unemployed Australians, there are still 37,800 more people lining the unemployment queue than when the Abbott-Turnbull government was first elected. \u201cLabor notes that the unemployment rate at 5.5% is comparable to that at the peak of the global financial crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are almost 1.1 million underemployed Australians looking for more work, but unable to find it. When coupled with the number of unemployed, it means there are more than 1.8 million Australians who are underutilised in the labour force. \u201cWith insecure work, record low wages growth and skyrocketing cost of living pressures, Australians are feeling the pinch and Turnbull and his Liberals have failed to acknowledge these challenges, let alone come up with any policy initiatives to deal with them,\u201d he said. The Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird said unemployment and underemployment ought to \u201cgrind lower\u201d over the next 12 months, helping wages growth to gradually lift. \u201cThis should put some mild upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations,\u201d Aird wrote to clients on Thursday. \u201cAs such, a first rate rise since 2010 looks probable this year. Indeed, current market pricing implies a greater than 50% chance of a rate rise by August 2018.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Gin parties, gin menus, ginvent calendars and even a Ginstitute hotel: the UK\u2019s renewed passion for all things gin is fast creating a whole new industry. There are 315 distilleries in Britain \u2013 more than double the number operating five years ago. According to figures collected by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which hands out licences to produce spirits, nearly 50 opened last year, while just a handful shut up shop. Demand for interesting gins, made by small scale craft and artisan producers has driven a near-20% rise in the total amount of the juniper-flavoured spirit sold. A total of 47m bottles worth \u00a31.2bn were served up last year \u2013 enough, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA), for 1.32bn gin and tonics. Such is its popularity that last year the Office for National Staistics put gin in the basket of goods it monitors to measure inflation. The craze has even reached BBC Radio 4\u2019s series The Archers, where Toby Fairbrother is now producing Scruff Gin, flavoured with his own mix of botanicals. Then there is the UK\u2019s first gin spa, where visitors can indulge in a juniper foot soak and a gin tasting menu. Trendy \u201cginsters\u201d quaff from balloon glasses and increasingly prefer a sprig of rosemary or a handful of red berries to the traditional ice and slice. Waitrose\u2019s spirits buyer, John Vine, said local and regional sales were driving the trend, rather than the international brands. Sales of artisan brands at the grocer are up 167%, compared with a 30% rise in mass-produced brands. \u201cThe rise in craft gin is certainly shows no sign of slowing,\u201d Vine said. \u201cTo meet demand, this week, we have introduced three new local and regional craft gins.\u201d The craft spirit boom follows a surge in demand for locally made small scale beers and wines, as the hipster generation seeks drinks with a more interesting taste created by individuals rather than faceless international corporations. Large drinks companies are battling to keep up and have started buying up smaller brands around the world. The London gin maker Sipsmith has been swallowed up by Beam Suntory, the world\u2019s third-largest spirits company, while Pernod Ricard has bought out craft gin brand Monkey 47. Miles Beale, chief executive of the WSTA, said the number of new distilleries showed there was no sign that the trend was coming to an end. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that many years ago when a pub would stock one gin brand, and now a gin menu offering a range of gins and mixers is commonplace in pubs and bars,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is welcome news that another 49 new distilleries opened in the UK last year, bringing new jobs to the British spirit industry and helping boost Britain\u2019s export potential.\u201d Exports totalled 180m bottles last year, worth \u00a3474m. Beale said distilleries in the UK were diversifying and new whiskies, vodkas, rums, brandies and liqueurs were appearing every year. Sainsbury\u2019s spirits buyer, Anne Cooper, said craft gin sales were up 20% year on year, and predicted that craft rum would be this year\u2019s new trend. \u201cIt\u2019s gin that has dominated the craft spirits movement until now but we\u2019re seeing a similar trend starting to emerge in rum, particularly dark and spiced variations. I\u2019d expect to see a lot more of this as we head into the spring and summer of 2018,\u201d she said. Vine said Waitrose would also expand its craft spirits range: \u201cWe don\u2019t stock an English whisky yet, but based on the success of gin, we will be looking into other types of locally made spirits this year.\u201d At least 19 distilleries in England and more in Wales are making or planning to make whisky in the coming years. Many of these have started producing gin because it can be made more quickly using the same equipment. Whisky must be aged in wooden casks for several years before itis bottled, so gin can provide income to keep a business going in the interim. Cooper King Distillery, near York, is expected to begin production of gin in the next few months, followed by a whisky in 2022. Its founders, Chris Jaume and Abbie Neilson, were inspired to set up their business after visiting Tasmania where local whisky Sullivan\u2019s Cove was named the best single malt in the world in 2014. \u201cIt opened our eyes that whisky could be made in other countries than Scotland and Japan,\u201d Jaume said. \u201cThe UK is dominated by scotch, but we are beginning to hear of people being disenchanted by a product made in such huge volumes. To some extent it has lost its romance.\u201d While there are plenty of small Scottish distilleries alongside the big names, Jaume said English whisky makers had more freedom to experiment as, for example, they can age their whisky in walnut or cherry wood casks. In Scotland all whisky has to be aged in oak. Jaume likened the rise of small distilleries to the craft beer boom. \u201cPeople are looking for a really great product and a really great experience. It\u2019s more expensive but people are willing to pay more if it tastes better and has got a story behind it,\u201d he said. Gin boom When the great gin boom began back in 2009 with the launch of Sipsmith, few thought that the category would still be expanding nearly 10 years later. Yet gin has overtaken vodka to become the most popular spirit in Britain, according to a recent YouGov poll. The public appetite for the stuff shows no signs of abating. One of the mothers at my daughter\u2019s school put on a gin festival last year. It proved so popular she\u2019s looking for a bigger venue this year. There are distilleries opening every month but, more importantly, most of the old ones are staying open. Here are three new brands that stand out from the crowd: Toad Gin (\u00a338.95) The vast majority of gins are made from bought-in neutral grain alcohol. Nothing wrong with that, but The Oxford Artisan Distillery (Toad) do things a bit differently by making their own high strength alcohol from ancient grains grown within 50 miles of the distillery. The result which was launched last year is a very classic juniper led gin. Foxhole Gin (\u00a339.95) Made in conjunction with the Bolney Wine Estate in Sussex using a spirit distilled from the leftovers from their harvest, which gives this gin a distinctive grapey, grassy taste but doesn\u2019t overpower the more traditional botanicals. It does marvellous things with vermouth making it perhaps the ultimate dry martini gin. Hibernation Gin (\u00a342.95) From Dyfi in Wales, this is another gin that makes full use of the local flora. It\u2019s flavoured with crab apples and blackberries as well as juniper for a refreshing fruity tang and then aged to a creamy consistency in old white port casks, like a good whisky. It might be too good to mix with tonic. Henry Jeffreys is the author of the book Empire of Booze: British History through the Bottom of a Glass",

It\u2019s more expensive but people are willing to pay more if it tastes better and has got a story behind it,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"639cfc197ef317273735aec72c7eed4a58ad66f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/639cfc197ef317273735aec72c7eed4a58ad66f1/0_36_4327_2596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kit Clancy, an assistant distiller, refills a copper pot still at the Sipmsith gin distillery in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kit Clancy, an assistant distiller, refills a copper pot still at the Sipmsith gin distillery in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Gin boom</h2> <p>When the great gin boom began back in 2009 with the launch of Sipsmith, few thought that the category would still be expanding nearly 10 years later.</p> <p>Yet gin has overtaken vodka to become the most popular spirit in Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/16/britons-set-new-gin-record-after-buying-47m-bottles-this-year-supermarkets-christmas\">according to a recent YouGov poll</a>. The public appetite for the stuff shows no signs of abating. One of the mothers at my daughter\u2019s school put on a gin festival last year. It proved so popular she\u2019s looking for a bigger venue this year. There are distilleries opening every month but, more importantly, most of the old ones are staying open.</p> <p>Here are three new brands that stand out from the crowd:</p> <p><strong>Toad Gin (\u00a338.95)</strong></p> <p>The vast majority of gins are made from bought-in neutral grain alcohol. Nothing wrong with that, but The Oxford Artisan Distillery (Toad) do things a bit differently by making their own high strength alcohol from ancient grains grown within 50 miles of the distillery. The result which was launched last year is a very classic juniper led gin.</p> <p><strong>Foxhole Gin (\u00a339.95)</strong></p> <p>Made in conjunction with the Bolney Wine Estate in Sussex using a spirit distilled from the leftovers from their harvest, which gives this gin a distinctive grapey, grassy taste but doesn\u2019t overpower the more traditional botanicals. It does marvellous things with vermouth making it perhaps the ultimate dry martini gin.</p> <p><strong>Hibernation Gin (\u00a342.95)</strong></p> <p>From Dyfi in Wales, this is another gin that makes full use of the local flora. It\u2019s flavoured with crab apples and blackberries as well as juniper for a refreshing fruity tang and then aged to a creamy consistency in old white port casks, like a good whisky. It might be too good to mix with tonic. </p> <p>Henry Jeffreys is the author of the book Empire of Booze: British History through the Bottom of a Glass</p>",

      "bodyText": "The former Queensland state-owned freight rail business Aurizon is the latest target of anti-Adani activists, after the Palaszczuk Labor government refused to rule out vetoing the company\u2019s taxpayer-funded loan to build the Galilee basin rail line. Opponents of the mine have accused the state government of attempting to break its promise of \u201cno public funds for Adani\u2019 through a \u201cbackdoor\u201d by continuing to consider Aurizon\u2019s application for federal government funds to build the central Queensland rail line. The rail line is considered a key piece of infrastructure in opening the central Queensland region up to mining and would ultimately boost Adani\u2019s prospects for opening its controversial mine. During Queensland\u2019s election campaign in November, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced Labor would veto any loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund (Naif) to Adani to build the rail line from the Galilee basin to the Gladstone port. Under Naif rules, the state has to agree for the funds to be spent. The veto was seen as helping win crucial votes in the state\u2019s south-east \u2013 where support for the Adani coalmine, once billed as the largest in the southern hemisphere, is low \u2013 and was considered instrumental in saving deputy premier Jackie Trad\u2019s seat. While the Adani loan is considered dead, Aurizon put in its own application to Naif in March 2017 to build the rail line, which would allow not only Adani but GVK Hancock and Clive Palmer to potentially move forward with their mining interests in the area. Ben Pennings, who is challenging Larissa Waters and Andrew Bartlett for the Queensland Greens\u2019 Senate spot, said the Galillee Blockade group, which was instrumental in lobbying against the Adani Naif loan, would now turn its attention to Aurizon. Trad, now the Queensland treasurer, was the first target, with a six-foot tall mascot, the \u201cveto mosquito\u201d, launched to follow state government MPs around until the Aurizon loan is also scuttled. \u201cLabor promised no public funds would be used to help this mine,\u201d Pennings said. \u201cThey are now looking at helping Adani through the backdoor, which is what this Aurizon loan would be. \u201cIt was a clear promise \u2013 no public funds for Adani. We are confident they will see sense and also veto this loan, so no public money goes to this mine either through the back or front door. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to hassle them to keep their promises but here we are.\u201d A spokeswoman for Palaszczuk said the Naif loan that Adani had applied for had been vetoed, meeting the premier\u2019s election commitment. But the government remained uncommitted on any further loan applications for the rail line. \u201cAny other Naif loan will be assessed on its merits,\u201d she said. The federal resources minister, Matt Canavan, strongly supports the mine. He attacked the state Labor government over its decision to veto the Adani loan and remains one of the firmest advocates for opening the basin up to mining. A spokeswoman for Aurizon confirmed the company had lodged its application for a Naif loan in March and said \u201cdialogue\u201d over the loan was continuing. \u201cAny commercial commitment to invest by Aurizon would requite long-term take or pay contracts for the full capacity and at appropriate rates of return with Aurizon board sign-off,\u201d she said. Pennings said he believed fighting the Aurizon loan was just as important as fighting Adani. \u201cIt could make the Adani coalmine billions of dollars cheaper,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows for Gina\u2019s mine [Hancock] or Clive\u2019s [Palmer] mine, to get the infrastructure they need. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep turning up at functions, press conferences and their offices, until they [Labor] get the message.\u201d Front Line Action on Coal Supporters of the Frontline Action on Coal group chained themselves to equipment at the central Queensland Abbot Point coal terminal on Thursday morning, shutting down the port for what they said was the second time this week.",
