      "bodyText": "The Dow reacted favorably to the news \u2013 since 2 p.m., when the rate increase was announced, the industrial average has steadily risen and closed up 1.28%. The S&amp;P 500 has followed an almost identical trajectory and closed up 1.45%. Neither Bernie Sanders nor the Guardian editorial board are sold on the rate change; we will doubtless be sussing out the effects of the hike for years go come. The blog is wrapping up for the afternoon but our full story on the meeting, the hike and the reaction from many different sectors is here. Keep coming back to the business section as the story unfolds. Dean Turner, an economist at UBS, said he believed the market impact would be largely positive, since what financial systems like least is equivocation and the last several months of will-they-or-won\u2019t-they has made investment difficult. \u201cMarkets should welcome the decision to hike US rates as it puts months of uncertainty to one side,\u201d he wrote. Turner, who also said UBS favored yield European bonds, said he thought further rate increases would not hurt economic growth domestically. \u201cWe expect the pace of tightening next year to be gradual, with four more hikes in 2016. Although this is more hawkish than the markets currently expect, we believe that the US economy will continue to expand.\u201d Turner also said the UK would likely follow suit. \u201cThe US interest rate rise is unlikely to influence the timing of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to hike rates,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHowever, it still looks as though the BoE will be the first central bank to follow the US, though the inflation and wage outlook over the next few months suggests they have time to wait. We currently expect the BoE to raise rates in May, followed by a further hike in November.\u201d Jana Kasperkevic, on the ground in DC, spoke to deputy labor secretary Chris Lu about part-time unemployment. There are few things that Yellen says the FED is still concerned about - one of them is the \u201cabnormal high level of part-time employment\u201d. Earlier this month, the US Department of Labor announced that \u201cthe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons\u201d - those who wanted a full time job and could not find one - \u201cincreased by 319,000 to 6.1 million in November, following declines in September and October.\u201d In an interview with the Guardian, the US Deputy Secretary of Labor Chris Lu dismissed that jump in part-time unemployed. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus too much on one month. This 319,000 is really significant drop from the month before. I don\u2019t have the number of what it went down by in October, but if you look at the long-term trend, going back to 2010, it has gone down significantly,\u201d Lu told the Guardian. The number of Americans employed part-time for economic reasons in October was about 5.76m. In September, that number was a little more than 6m. Lu is however, correct that the number has come down over the years. Just last year, in November 2014, the number of those working part-time jobs but wanting full time jobs was 6.85m. In 2012, that number was 8.1m. When asked if the November jump in part-time workers was significant, Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute also said that the number was not a reason for alarm. \u201cThose numbers are jumpy,\u201d she told the Guardian. After clocking in an hour and seven minutes of press conference, Yellen ends her final comments with another assertion that the Fed will watch wages closely (along with inflation, unemployment, and every other economic measure) as it decides whether to hike interest rates again. Yellen wants Americans to think of the new interest rate as a vote of confidence in the economy. Democratic candidate for president Bernie Sanders thinks she\u2019s made a big mistake. \u201cWhen millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise interest rates is bad news for working families. At a time when real unemployment is nearly 10 percent and youth unemployment is off the charts, we need to do everything possible to create millions of good-paying jobs and raise the wages of the American people. \u201cThe Fed should act with the same sense of urgency to rebuild the disappearing middle class as it did to bail out Wall Street banks seven years ago.\u201d And not that the chairwoman asked, the Guardian\u2019s editorial board has also dubbed the increase \u201crisky and premature\u201d, due to the unusual pace of the economy after the recession. Yellen says the Fed isn\u2019t following a calendar for interest rates, but she says it like this: \u201cIt is not the intention of the commiIttee to follow any mechanical formula of that type.\u201d \u201cI see import prices and energy prices as holding down\u201d inflation, she says. We\u2019re coming towards the end of Yellen\u2019s press conference and so far the stock markets are loving it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen pretty much constantly since she started talking. We\u2019ve come a long way considering that any talk of a rate hike used to send investors into a panic. Yellen again dodges a question about what happens if inflation doesn\u2019t do what the Fed wants it to (increase gradually on its way up to 2%). She alludes to the stock market shocks of international markets and the continuing plummet of energy prices. \u201cI do expect there is a bottom to that, I expect that we\u2019ll be seeing that.\u201d The Fed will keep an open mind about action to cope with inflation, she says, but again refuses to get into what the committee will look for as it judges the consequences of its own decisions. Long-term loans should not move much because of the decision, Yellen tells a reporter, urging the same calm as she has for nearly an hour. \u201cLoans that are linked to longer term interest rates are unlikely to move very much,\u201d she says, using \u201csome corporate loans\u201d as an example. \u201cSome credit card rates and short-term borrowing rates might move up slightly,\u201d she concedes. But \u201cremember,\u201d she says, \u201cwe\u2019ve made a very small move.\u201d Today\u2019s decision follows months of debate and dissent, my colleagues Jana Kasperkevic and Rupert Neate note \u2013 but today\u2019s decision was unanimous. In his analysis of the minutes from the October\u2019s meeting, Rupert observed: \u201c\u2019a couple\u2019 members raised concerns that raising rates in December could be premature.\u201d The first dissent this year came during the September meeting, when Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, broke ranks and voted to increase the interest rates. \u201cUS economic conditions have improved quite significantly over the last six years, all things considered. It\u2019s time to recognize the substantial progress that has been achieved and align rates accordingly,\u201d Lacker said at the time. \u201cI supported raising the target range for the federal-funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. Interest rates have been near zero for over six years. Even after a quarter-point increase, interest rates would remain exceptionally low, providing ample support for economic growth. \u201d Lacker\u2019s dissent broke a stretch of five straight unanimous votes \u2013 spanning back to January of this year. Interest rates are up from de facto zero, Yellen thinks the US economy is fit, and for the first time in seven years the Federal Reserve isn\u2019t working with record-low, pro-expansion rates. The key word in Fed\u2019s statement was \u201cgradual\u201d. Financial markets would have been spooked had it talked about a \u201cmeasured\u201d increase in interest rates, because that would have suggested a repetition of the last cycle of US monetary tightening between 2004 and 2006, when there were 17 separate quarter-point jumps in the cost of borrowing. The drip-drip approach that eventually killed off the housing boom and prompted the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Nobody expects a repeat of that, because much has changed since 2006. America\u2019s recovery has been weak by its own standards, the percentage of Americans working has fallen, and there is no real inflationary pressure. The \u201cnew normal\u201d for interest rates is around 2%, not the 5%-plus they reached before the great recession. Wall Street took the decision by the US central bank to raise the cost of borrowing in its stride, and no wonder. This has been one of the best flagged interest rate decisions in history and the emollient language used by the Fed was exactly what traders had been expecting. Manufacturing, the skewed employment participation rates, and other \u201cpressures\u201d do concern the fed, the chairwoman says, \u201cbut the underlying health of the US economy I consider to be quite sound.\u201d I think it\u2019s a myth that expansions die of old age, I do not think that they die of old age. So the fact that this has been quite a long expansion doesn\u2019t lead me to believe that it\u2019s days are numbered. But the economy does get hit by shocks and there are both positive shocks and negative shocks, so there is a significant odds that the economy will suffer some shock that we don\u2019t know about that will put it into recession. So yes there is some probability that that could happen and of course we would appropriately respond but it isn\u2019t something that is fated to happen because we\u2019ve had a long expansion. \u201cYes, we have tolerated inflation shortfalls that we thought would disappear,\u201d she says, without answering the question exactly of what the Fed would do if inflation continues to defy their expectations. She answers a similar question about contingency plans by saying the Fed is focused on medium and long-term projections. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you a simple formula for what we want to see\u201d on inflation, Yellen says, dodging a question about the Fed\u2019s vaunted but still mysterious \u201cmedium term\u201d plan. So far the chairwoman has not described it in many terms aside from \u201ctransitory\u201d and \u201cgradual\u201d. Yellen says the \u201csomewhat abnormally high level of part-time employment\u201d is one of the markers that continues to concern her, and the Fed wants to watch what happens next with unemployment and inflation before taking action. She repeats that it was very important to her not to wait too long and be \u201cforced to tighten abruptly\u201d. That would risk \u201caborting what I would like to see as a very long-running and sustainable expansion\u201d, she says. \u201cWe recognize that inflation is well below our 2% goal,\u201d she says, but the committee has a theory for how inflation should behave. \u201cWe\u2019re reasonably close, not quite there, but reasonably close to our maximum employment objective, but we have a significant shortfall on inflation.\u201d The Fed will watch and wait, Yellen says, to see what this long awaited hike affects the markets. I think it\u2019s prudent to be able to watch what the impact is on financial conditions and spending in the economy, and moving in a timely fashion enables us to do this. She asks the press not to make too much of this first tentative nudge toward a normal policy. She I think it\u2019s important not to overblow the significance of this first move, it\u2019s only 25 basis points. Monetary poilcy remainds accomodative. \u2026 We will be watching very carefully what happens in the economy.\u201d Yellen shows a slide with the committee members\u2019 predictions \u2013 the dot plot. Yellen lays out the committee\u2019s forecasts, saying the Fed will respond according to the health of the economy. \u201cA stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral funds rate is rising more quickly than expected,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the economy were to disappoint the federal funds rate would rise more slowly \u2026 The committee is confident that the normalization process will proceed smoothly.\u201d She says the committee is \u201cprepared to make adjustments to our tools\u201d if the market demands it. \u201cWe recognize that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect future economic outcomes,\u201d Yellen continues. Were the Fed to wait \u201ctoo long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly at some point to keep the economy from overheating and to keep inflation from [dramatically] overshooting our objective.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to risk another recession, and says interest rates will likely change only very gradually. Yellen lays out median growth projections: 2.2% for GDP growth for this year, 2.4% for next year. The path of the median longer-run unemployment rate is slightly lower than the Fed had previously predicted, she adds. They expect inflation to remain very low for the near future, and expect it to reach 2% not until 2018. \u201cDevelopments abroad\u201d could still threaten the stability of the US economy, Yellen says, but nowhere near what they could have done this summer. The economy is strong enough to weather their fluctuations, she says. Yellen notes that low energy prices and the appreciation of the dollar have \u201cweighed on inflation\u201d and held down import prices. But \u201cas these transitory influences fade and as the labor market [increases] further, the committee\u201d believes inflation will reach 2%, she says. Yellen outlines the criteria that she believes the economy has met for making an interest rate increase feasible. Unemployment is down to 5%, she says, with some caveats. \u201cThat said, some cyclical weakness likely remains. The labor force participation rate is still below estimates \u2026 and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup.\u201d \u201cUS real gross domestic product is estimated to have increased at an average pace of 2.25%,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis weakness has been offset by solid expansion of domestic spending. Continued job gains and increases in real disposable income have [increased] household spending,\u201d and car purchases are strong even as new home construction is still slow. \u201cWith gradual adjustments,\u201d she continues, \u201ceconomic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\u201d Janet Yellen begins her comments: \u201cThis action marks the end of an extraordinary 7 year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery of the economy from the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.\u201d She says the economy \u201chas come a long way\u201d though it\u2019s not where she\u2019d quite like it yet. She says that normalization \u201cis likely to proceed gradually\u201d, and \u201cinflation continues to run below our longer run objective\u201d. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen will speak about the decision to nudge interest rates up in approximately two minutes. You can watch here, or in the embedded video at the top of the blog. And the markets react with just that: a zig-zag of a reaction, followed by what\u2019s largely a return to pre-announcement levels. The Dow is up 99 points, Treasuries are down, and the Euro\u2019s back to where it was. The quickest of takes from financial journalists and investors, ahead of Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference to elaborate on the decision. The full statement from the board of the Federal Reserve on the historic increase in interest rates: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective. Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee\u2019s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Interest rates will increase by 0.25%, the Federal Reserve has announced, the first hike after seven years of record lows. The Fed\u2019s statement on the increase says the decision is based on the economy \u201cexpanding at a moderate pace\u201d, with spending and investment increasing at \u201csolid rates\u201d and an improved housing sector. The Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. \u2026 Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The statement says that the Fed expects inflation to rise to 2% \u201cover the medium term\u201d. From inside the Fed: \u201cChair is in the house. I saw her\u201d says one journalist. \u201cShe is wearing blue.\u201d What\u2019s going to happen in seven minutes, when the Fed announces its plans for the fate of the economy? A hike in interest rates, most likely, but nobody knows what Janet Yellen and her cohorts quite intend. HSBC and MarketWatch have taken a stab at prognostication. A small hike A dovish hike scenario would reinforce HSBC\u2019s view that the dollar will weaken against its G-10 rivals in 2016. HSBC was one of the first major currency dealers to sour on the greenback. Back in the spring, the team, led by chief strategist David Bloom, accurately called the dollar\u2019s peak (at least, so far). The base case forecast calls for the euro to strengthen to $1.20 by the end of 2016. A big hike If the Fed\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t adhere to the cautious profile that many have anticipated, the dollar would likely benefit from a \u201crisk off\u201d rally, leaving the Aussie, kiwi and many emerging-market currencies vulnerable \u2026 \u201cIn the end, a [dollar] rally may sow the seeds of its own destruction as it would make delivery of additional rate hikes increasingly unnecessary. Short-term, however, we would not fight the [dollar] rally,\u201d HSBC said. No hike is also possible, and it\u2019s most uncertain how markets would respond should Yellen delay hikes yet again. At the Fed, my colleague Jana Kasperkevic waits with the other journalists, one of whom laments Yellen\u2019s timing: \u201cChairwoman Yellen, why, why did you decide to raise the interest rates today? Today of all days, nine days before Christmas!\u201d As the clock ticks down to the Fed\u2019s big announcement, Janet Yellen and her fellows take over Twitter \u2026 \u2026 where financial journalists proceed to pore over her horoscope. And share interactive games of Federal Reserve interest hike bingo. Anyone wondering whether the Fed reallywill raise rates this time might want to look back at Yellen\u2019s comments the last time they went up, long ago in June 2006, business editor Dominic Rushe writes. Back then Yellen was president of the San Francisco Fed and argued against a raise \u2013before deciding to vote with her colleagues for an increase. \u201cIn general, I believe that we should do the right thing, even if it surprises markets, but in this case our public statements seem to have convinced the public that we will raise the funds rate today,\u201d she said then. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t follow through, there would likely be some loss of credibility for policy.\u201d Yellen and other Fed officials have pretty clearly signaled that a rise is coming this time If it doesn\u2019t she may damage her credibility \u2013 and cause panic in the markets. Fed watchers are responding to the (possibly) last minutes of the rock-bottom-interest-rates era with \u2026 mixed emotions. My colleague Jana Kasperkevic is in Washington to hear from the chairwoman herself \u2013 she\u2019s sent a photo from the bowels of DC. She says that a photographer and a sound tech are bantering about how cold the room is. \u201cYou sit in a meat locker where interest rates go to die,\u201d the photographer says, pausing for effect. \u201cWell, except today.\u201d This is your 60 minute warning! We have one hour to wait until a potentially historic rate rise (or serious market volatility if the Fed surprises us all) Here\u2019s a quick guide of what to watch out for when the Federal Reserve makes its decision. Does the Fed raise rates, and by how much? Borrowing costs are currently 0% to 0.25% - the market expects a 25 basis point rise, to 0.5%. But there is some chatter that the Fed could take a baby steps, and only raise the fund rate by 10 basis points. Was the Fed split? The rate-setting committee contains hawks and doves. In October, Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond split and voted for a hike. This time, it\u2019s possible that the dovish Chicago Fed President Charles Evans might refuse to support higher borrowing costs. The economic forecasts. Is the Fed more upbeat about growth and employment prospects? The dot plot. As explained earlier, each Fed policymaker will use dots to show where they think interest rates will be between today and 2018. Barclays\u2019 Michael Gapen predicts the plot will show four rate rises in 2016. Janet Yellen\u2019s tone. Today\u2019s press conference is a key moment in Yellen\u2019s career. Her guidance will be crucial in determining whether the Fed avoids spooking investors. Expect to see the word \u201cgradual\u201d pop up plenty of times. My US colleague Alan Yuhas will guide you through the next few hours... Michael Gapen, Barclays\u2019 chief US economist, says the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal today is to raise interest rates and avoid causing any market turmoil. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Gapen says the Fed has a \u201cvery real and very tangible\u201d fear of spooking investors. The real trick today is to get off zero, but avoid a taper tantrum. (The taper tantrum occurred in June 2013, when global markets tumbled on fears that the Fed was about to slow its QE bond-buying programme) We\u2019re into the last 90 minutes before the Fed decision hits the wires.... Jack Welch, the legendary former boss of General Electric, believes the Fed should have bitten the bullet back in September. Speaking on CNBC today, Welch argued that rates should have been raised three months ago - before the rout in the commodity market got underway: \u201cIt would have been better to go last time actually. Conditions were better. The economy is not any stronger. The commodities have gone further down.\u201d Of course, if the Fed had hiked in September, we\u2019d have blamed them for the recent slump in oil prices which has rattled stock markets. Janet Yellen faces the media 30 minutes after the interest rate decision hits the wires (2.30pm in Washington, or 7.30pm for UK readers) That press conference will be as significant as the decision itself - as the Fed chair\u2019s comments will be microscopically examined by investors around the globe: Yellen will be probed about the likely path of interest rates, her view of the US economy, and also her assessment of global markets. In September, the Fed cited market jitteriness over China\u2019s slowing economy as a reason to leave rates unchanged. The Financial Times has pulled together a handy guide to the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision today: Here\u2019s a flavour: What is expected? The 10 officials setting US monetary policy are forecast to raise the range for the Fed funds rate \u2014 the interest banks charge each other overnight to lend reserves kept at the Fed \u2014 by a quarter percentage point from 0-0.25 per cent to 0.25-0.5 per cent. If they do raise, how will officials explain the move? Policymakers have been at pains to stress that their actions are dependent on the state of the economy, so expect them to point to the cumulative progress it has made since emerging from recession in 2009. The most recent bulletins from the labour market (211,000 jobs created in November) and inflation (a core measure hit 2 per cent last month) may have given officials the extra confidence they needed in order to move. What about the pace of rate rises? That the pace of increases is more important than the timing of the first one has arguably been the mantra of Fed officials this year. So should the rate be lifted, expect to hear more of that. More here: Fed rate decision: what to watch for After two thousand, five hundred and fifty six days of record low interest rates, dating back to December 2008, America has just two hours to wait until the Fed (possibly) ends the era of ultra-loose monetary policy. Over on Wall Street, the tension is building, ahead of the announcement at 2pm local time (7pm GMT) European stock markets have closed for the night, meaning equity traders in the City must now sit and wait for the Fed. Most markets closed higher, but there was a late and somewhat jittery selloff. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100: up 43 points at 6,061, +0.72% Germany\u2019s DAX: up 16 points at 10,466, + 0.16% French CAC: up 13 points at 4,627, +0.28% Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says there could be dramatic moves tomorrow.... There may well be some marked volatility tomorrow morning too, depending on the tone that Janet Yellen adopts in the press conference and it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that this could take a couple of days to work itself through the system. As well as the interest rate decision, the Federal Reserve will also give us a pre-Christmas treat - its latest economic forecasts. And that means economists, analysts and journalists across the globe will be squinting at the latest \u201cdot plot\u201d; a chart showing where policymakers believe interest rates will be in the next few years. The dot plot is a crucial part of the Fed\u2019s message, partly because the last one showed that the Fed expects rates to rise faster than the markets. Tony Crescenzi of bond-trading giant Pimco told CNBC that: \u201cThe dots are positioned for three to four [rate rises], and the market is positioned for two to three. It may seem out of sync with the dovish hike view.\u201d Here\u2019s the last dot plot, from September: (Note the festive Christmas tree formation in 2018) The yield, or interest rate, on US two-year government debt has hit 1%, for the first time since May 2010. That\u2019s another sign that Wall Street is bracing for the Fed to start tightening monetary policy. Yields (which measure the rate of return on a bond) rise when prices fall, so rising yields mean traders are selling safe-haven US Treasuries. The early rally on Wall Street is petering out. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up 100 points earlier, has just turned negative. That\u2019s partly due to the oil price. US crude is down 4% today, after new supply figures showed that stocks rose by 4.8m barrels last week. Analysts had expected a drop of 1.4 million barrels, so fears of an oil glut are hitting shares. I trust this tweet is useful to any readers in emerging markets, wondering how the Fed\u2019s decision will affect them: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at City spread-betting firm IG, also reckons shares could rally once Janet Yellen has spoken today: The commentary surrounding today\u2019s announcement will be hugely important as this sets out expectations for future hikes. With a notorious dove at the helm, it is highly likely that Yellen will avoid needlessly spooking the markets and instead focus on the fact rates will rise at a relatively gradual and leisurely pace. Brian Davidson of Capital Economics has nailed his trousers to the mast, and predicted that global stock markets will applaud a rate hike today. In a research note to clients, Davidson says: We think that a 25bp rise in the federal funds rate is likely to be seen as a vote of confidence in the US and world economy, and could boost global equity markets. He also produced this graph, showing how stock markets have typically rallied after a Fed hike - although Wall Street has usually lagged behind other developed markets (such as the City of London, and Tokyo). Davidson reckons the US stock market will \u2018edge higher\u2019 in 2016, with other developed markets (DMs) doing better: Not only do we expect multinationals in Japan and the euro-zone to receive a boost to their earnings via weaker currencies, but we think that there is more scope for corporate profit margins to rise in many DMs, given the stage of the business cycle in these countries. The wisdom of crowds... It may not be scientific (there were just 89 votes!) but it highlights that the markets are expecting the Fed\u2019s more hawkish members to carry the day. The foreign exchange markets are quiet today - but it could be the calm before the storm. The dollar is currently up against the British pound, but flat against the euro: Here\u2019s a handy way of decoding the Fed statement in a few hour\u2019s time: Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, remembers the last time the Fed started raising rates. (here\u2019s the Fed statement from June 2004) Three of the last four tightening cycles have seen the Federal Reserve hike rates steadily, as this chart from Credit Suisse shows: History probably won\u2019t repeat itself this time -- Fed chair Janet Yellen is likely to emphasise that future rate hikes will be gradual. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, has told Reuters he expects that a dovish performance from Janet Yellen today (the so-called \u2018dovish hike\u2019) \u201cI think the ideal outcome today is that the Fed raises rates and they give us a lot of verbiage that says we\u2019re going to go slow.\u201d \u201cYellen is a dove and she is going to remain a dove. She has to follow through and hammer home that they\u2019re not going to be in a hurry and that\u2019s what the market wants.\u201d The Wall Street opening bell is being rung, and trading is underway in New York. It could be a historic session - the day that the Federal Reserve begins the long process of normalising monetary policy. And right now, investors are facing that prospect in good heart. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 0.9% in early trading, gaining 164 points to 17,689. The S&amp;P 500 (a broader measure of the stock market) is up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Here\u2019s the Federal Reserve\u2019s HQ in Washington today, where policymakers are pondering whether to end seven years of record low borrowing costs: Three months ago, there was genuine uncertainly over whether the Fed would raise interest rates or not (in the end they didn\u2019t, of course). But today\u2019s decision is a no-brainer, at least according to Kully Samra, a managing director at investment manager Charles Schwab, who says: \u201cIt is a foregone conclusion that the Fed is going to raise rates.\u201d (The latest pricing from the financial markets suggests there s a 78% chance of a rate hike tonight) Just five hours to go.... One thing is certain. Whatever the Fed say today will be a lot less alarming than the statement they issued on December 17 2008 as the biggest financial crisis in generations swirled. By delicious timing, today is the seventh anniversary of the historic rate cut that brought the Fed fund rate down to almost zero. And here\u2019s how they announced it: Hat-tip to Bloomberg\u2019s Lorcan Roche Kelly for this info: The Jubilee Debt Campaign, the anti-poverty charity, has warned that a US interest rate rise would bring new pain to world\u2019s poorest countries. Their director, Sarah-Jayne Clifton, says: \u201cMany developing countries are already suffering from a fall in prices of their commodity exports. An increase in US interest rates will compound this further, further weakening exchange rates and increasing debt payments. It\u2019s already been a tough year for emerging market currencies. The Malasian Ringgit, for example, has shed almost a quarter of its value against the US dollar since January. Brazil\u2019s Real has tumbled by over 40%. There are several reasons why the Fed should raise interest rates today, and just as many reasons for caution. The \u201chike now\u201d brigade can point to the jobless rate. At just 5%, it is close to the measure of \u2018full employment\u2019 where wages could soon spike (although today\u2019s UK employment report, showing record employment and lower wage growth, rather undermines that theory!) Inflation is picking up (although at just 0.5% it\u2019s hardly red-hot). And there\u2019s the argument that a modest rate rise now reduces the danger that Janet Yellen has to aggressively hike in the future. But this is not an easy call. The Federal Reserve needs to consider the impact on the world economy. Huge amounts of capital flowed into emerging markets in recent years, and is now heading back to the US - destabilising developing economies and weakening their currencies. That could have a knock-in effect on the US economy, especially if a stronger dollar makes exports less attractive overseas. And while the US labour market looks solid at first glance, wage growth is still modest. And the proportion of people who have dropped out of the labour market is the highest since 1977. Ultimately, the Fed may conclude that raising rates today is simply less disruptive than shocking the markets by leaving them on hold. This chart from the Economist (printed before yesterday\u2019s inflation data showed CPI had risen from 0.2% to 0.5%), outlines the issues in more detail: Raising interest rates is not quite as simple a process as you might expect, especially if you\u2019re starting from zero. The FT\u2019s Robin Wigglesworth has examined the process here, and explained why it might be bumpy. How the US Federal Reserve intends to raise rates As Robin explains, the Fed\u2019s traditional weapon is its \u201cfunds rate\u201d, which has been stuck at between zero and 0.25 per cent for exactly seven years. This rate determines how much commercial banks are paid to leave funds at the Fed\u2019s vaults. By keeping it so low for so long, the Fed has been trying to encourage banks to put their money to work elsewhere. Most economists believe that the Fed will raise the funds rate to 0.5% at today\u2019s meeting. That should ripple out across the market, as banks won\u2019t be prepared to lend to anyone for less than they could get from the Fed. But in practice, many lenders cannot access the Fed\u2019s fund rate directly, And with so much money swirling in the system, So the Fed might use a different weapon to push borrowing costs up. Over to Robin.... Acting as a floor for now at 0.05 per cent, the overnight reverse repo programme, or Overnight RRP, is primarily aimed at money market funds, and is expected to do much of the heavy lifting. In a typical RRP the Fed\u2019s market desk sells a Treasury bond from its portfolio to a money-market fund and agrees to buy it back the next day at a certain price, a process known as \u201crepo\u201d, short for repurchase. In practice, the central bank\u2019s balance sheet does not shrink, but this sets a benchmark for cash interest rates paid by the Fed itself. These RRP operations will happen every business day between 12.45pm and 1.15pm in New York. The Fed might need to boost its RRP activities considerably, in order to transmit higher borrowing costs into the market. And that means that the process might not be as smooth as one might like.... The New York stock market is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead, when trading begins in two hours time. The futures market suggests the Dow Jones industrial average will jump by 104 points, or 0.6%, when Wall Street opens. CNBC points out that it\u2019s eleven and a half-years since the Federal Reserve began its last \u2018tightening cycle\u2019 (starting the process of raising interest rates) in summer 2004. That last cycle lasted two years, and was ended by the credit crunch in 2007. The next cycle is likely to move slowly, with the Fed possibly only raising interest rates twice next year.... In seven hours time, three Wall Street economists will either feel a bit daft or incredibly astute..... European stock markets are now rallying as investors anticipate that the long period of record low US interest rates will end tonight. There are still more than seven and a half hours until the Federal Reserve announces its decision. As covered in the introduction, the Fed will probably hike rates from the current low of 0% to 0.25%, ending seven years of historically easy money. Alastair McCaig of IG says a rate hike is widely expected: Fed Chair Janet Yellen has already told Santa what she wants as an early Christmas present and only time will tell if she has been good enough to get it. Over 95% of institutional analysts are calling for a 25 basis point increase and futures markets are factoring in an 80% chance that is what we will see. And that certainty is pushing shares higher. It follows a strong session in Asia, where the Japanese and Australian markets both gained more than 2%. There\u2019s also plenty of speculation that we\u2019ll get a \u2018dovish hike\u2019; Janet Yellen may emphasise that rates will still rise slowly, and only if the data justifies it. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 of top blue-chip shares is leading the rally risen by 48 points to 6066, a gain of 0.8%. European markets are being boosted by this morning\u2019s PMI surveys from Markit. They show that the eurozone\u2019s private sector has posted its strongest quarter in four and a half-years. The drop in wage growth is a reminder that many families will enter 2016 in a worrying financial position. My colleague Heather Stewart writes: Wage growth across the economy has slowed to 2%, underlining the financial challenges facing households in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that average wages grew at an annual rate of 2% in the three months to October. That marked a significant weakening from the 2.4% growth seen in the previous three-monthly period. With inflation running at just 0.1%, living standards are still rising, on average. But anaemic pay growth undermines hopes that household balance sheets will continue to improve after the long post-recession squeeze that saw pay flat or falling for several years. Once bonuses were included, pay growth in the three months to October was still just 2.4%, down from 3% over July to September, the ONS said. Here\u2019s her story on today\u2019s unemployment report: Britain\u2019s bosses argue that they need to achieve higher productivity in order to fund pay rises. Michael Martins, economic analyst at the Institute of Directors, says the UK labour market looks in good shape: \u201cYet again, these latest jobs figures make for welcome reading. The facts are impressive, and, given the turbulence which is affecting many parts of the world, worth repeating. In nearly every aspect, the labour market is tightening. The employment rate is at its highest ever level, the unemployment rate is down to its lowest since well before the crash at 5.2%, and youth unemployment \u2013 always a tricky problem to solve \u2013 continues to fall impressively. All of this indicates we are closing in on full employment. But on wages, Martins points out that productivity increases have not matched this year\u2019s pay rises. He also suggests that the sight of inflation turning negative this year may have undermined the case for bumper pay claims. \u201cFirms may be taking advantage of the low-inflation era to offer smaller nominal increases in salaries while employees who have benefitted from cheaper food and fuel prices may not be demanding as much. Since so many jobs are still being created, and young and long-term unemployed people are moving back in to work, these new jobs may simply pay less, dragging down the average figures. Classic economics teaching would suggest that wage growth should be accelerating as the unemployment rate drops (as firms are forced to stump up more to attract staff). As Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, points out, this isn\u2019t happening right now: There is a palpable sense of \u201cp\u00e0yj\u00e9 vu\u201d in the labour market, a reminder of the initial phase of the economic recovery characterized by a jobs boom alongside weak productivity and pay growth. What\u2019s most surprising it that for all the talk of mounting skills shortages employers appear perfectly capable of hiring at will without having to hike pay rates. The pound is falling against the US dollar, losing half a cent to $1.4992. Traders are calculating that the weak pay growth means there\u2019s even less chance that UK interest rates will rise soon. Bank of England policymakers have repeatedly said they want to see solid wage growth before hiking borrowing costs. So the sharp drop in average pay rises, to 2%, gives them another reason to sit tight. Today\u2019s report shows that Britain\u2019s bosses tightened the purse-strings in October. Regular pay, excluding bonuses, rose by just 1.7% during that month. That dragged pay growth during the August-October quarter down to 2% from 2.5%. Even when bonuses are included, total pay dropped to 1.9% in October - much lower than the 3% recorded in July-September. Here\u2019s the top line analysis of today\u2019s unemployment report, from the Office for National Statistics. It shows that employment levels in Britain hit record highs, joblessness fall again, but wage growth went off the boil: There were 31.30 million people in work, 207,000 more than for May to July 2015 and 505,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 22.88 million people working full-time, 338,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 8.42 million people working part-time, 167,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 73.9%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.71 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 110,000 fewer than for May to July 2015 and 244,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 939,000 unemployed men, 153,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 774,000 unemployed women, 91,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate was 5.2%, lower than for a year earlier (6.0%). It has not been lower since the 3 months to January 2006. The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labour force (those in work plus those unemployed) that were unemployed. There were 8.93 million people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive (not working and not seeking or available to work), 63,000 fewer than for May to July 2015 and 126,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The inactivity rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive) was 21.9%, lower than for a year earlier (22.3%). The inactivity rate has not been lower since October to December 1990. Comparing August to October 2015 with a year earlier, pay for employees in Great Britain increased by 2.4% including bonuses and by 2.0% excluding bonuses. Pay rises may be falling because employers have noticed that inflation has been hovering around zero all year. The UK consumer prices index is currently 0.1%, meaning pay rises are not being eaten up by inflation. But real wage increases of 2% are still modest in historical terms, especially when you remember that workers suffered falling real wages for several years after the financial crisis began. This chart shows how UK pay growth slowed sharply last quarter: The latest UK unemployment report is out, and it shows a sharp, and worrying, slowdown in pay growth. The good news is that the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.2%, which is the lowest level since 2008 - the start of the financial crisis. It hasn\u2019t been lower since January 2006. And the employment rate has risen to 73.9%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. BUT wage growth has slowed alarmingly. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by just 2% annually in the three months to October. That\u2019s sharply down on the 2.4% recorded in the three months to September, and is the slowest rate since early 2015. Pay including bonuses rose by 2.4% during the quarter, down from 3% in the three months to September. It suggests that the welcome boost in real earnings earlier this year may already be petering out.... More to follow.... Investors should avoid going anywhere too exotic over Christmas, as the Federal Reserve could provoke fresh upheaval in the markets. That\u2019s according to Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank. He says that today\u2019s \u201chighly anticipated and overly hyped FOMC December meeting\u201d will probably spark significant volatility -- many younger traders on Wall Street haven\u2019t experienced a rate hike before, after all. We are unconvinced that global markets will stabilize after the FOMC decision, so traders should keep their vacations local. Rosenstreich also predicts that higher borrowing costs will force more junk bonds into default: There have been worrying swings in high yield credit spreads (and Third Avenue\u2019s collapse) indicting the debt market\u2019s anxiety with adapting to the new tightening era. As pointed out by the Financial Times today the $1.3tn junk bond markets has relied heavily on endless cheap money. While so far only the energy sectors have been truly effected we suspect that defaults will quickly spread as the cost of funding swiftly rises.\u201d (Third Avenue announced last week it was shutting its Focused Credit Fund, which invested in high-yield (and thus riskier) assets) Tension is rising in the City, even though there\u2019s AGES until the Fed delivers its decision (at 7pm GMT or 2pm East Coast time) Kit Juckes, top currency strategist at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is Fed up (geddit?!) after months of speculation about today\u2019s central bank meeting, and the twists and turns in the foreign exchange market. At this point, my brain\u2019s scrambled. Yesterday was all about positions being taken off, but did I know that would mean option expiries taking EUR/USD sharply lower in the afternoon? No I did not... We\u2019ve waited so long for this policy move that the initial reaction may be meaningless. Beyond the very short term however, the US economy will go on growing, the Fed will hike further, and the dollar will rally through 2016. A cautious start to trading in Europe has seen some stock markets dip into the red: After strong rallies yesterday, investors may be getting a dose of pre-Fed jitters: Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: It\u2019s finally here! December\u2019s Fed Wednesday is upon us and with it the likely end to the year-long uncertainty over when exactly the central bank is going to raise interest rates. Yet with nothing certain until the big reveal this evening the markets are looking pretty jittery, the European open suffering a case of pre-game nerves after yesterday\u2019s aggressive rebound. It is exactly seven years since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to their current record lows of between zero and 0.25%. That historic decision was taken in December 2008 -- a few weeks after Barack Obama won the US presidential election. At the time, few people thought rates would stay so low for so long. Indeed, Ben Bernanke has admitted as much. The former Fed chair told Marketwatch that policymakers expected the economy would grow faster: We were over-optimistic about the pace of growth in large part because we didn\u2019t anticipate the slowdown in productivity growth that we\u2019ve seen. However, from a cyclical perspective, the economy has recovered in fact more quickly than we anticipated in that the unemployment rate has fallen more quickly than we thought it would, indicating that we have moved back towards something approaching full employment. Over the last three years, the unemployment rate has fallen about 3 percentage points which is relatively rapid, so, in that respect, the economy has actually done a little better than we have anticipated but in terms of overall growth it\u2019s been less good. Germany has outperformed France (again). The German private sector is growing at a healthy rate this month, with the \u2018composite PMI\u2019 coming in at 54.9, close to November\u2019s 55.2. The first economic data of the day is disappointing. France\u2019s private sector has slowed to near-stagnation this month, with service sector firms reporting a slump in new business following November\u2019s terrorist attacks. Data firm Markit\u2019s composite output index, which tracks thousands of French firms, fell to 50.3 in December from 51.0 in November. That\u2019s worryingly close to the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Although manufacturing firms reported faster growth, service sector providers experienced the slowest rise in new work since August.\uf0a7 Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, explains: \u201cFrench private sector output growth nearly ground to a halt at the end of 2015 amid faltering new business intakes. A slowdown in the dominant service sector was the driver, with some panellists indicating that their new business intakes had been impacted following the recent terrorist attacks. Shares in hotel groups and airlines fell in the aftermath of the Paris atrocities, as analysts warned that tourism would suffer. France\u2019s economy expanded by just 0.3% in the last quarter, not enough to lower its record unemployment rate. This PMI report suggests that growth may be slowing... My US colleague Jana Kasperkevic has pulled together a guide to today\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting: There are no early dramas in the European sovereign debt markets. Government bonds are changing hands at similar prices to last night, suggesting we\u2019re in a holding pattern ahead of the Fed: Some analysts, such as London Capital Market\u2019s Ipek Ozkardeskaya, just want the whole thing to be over: Central bank decision rooms are rarely places of peace and tranquility (as regular observers of the European Central Bank know well!). And the members of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee (FOMC) are unlikely to be united at today\u2019s meeting. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons as many as three policymakers could oppose a 25 basis point hike in rates today: Given the Fed\u2019s ability to surprise and the current uncertain environment does it seem likely that the Fed will do as the market expects, or could we see a seriously split vote of at least three dissenters, with Evans, Brainard and Tarullo the most likely candidates? We need to consider the divergent nature of views aired in recent weeks which are bound to come into play and there is also the remote possibility that we could see a fudge that pleases nobody, and catches the market by surprise. Hewson also suggests that the Fed could surprise investors: A surprise could take the form of a band hike of 12.5 basis points, as opposed to 25, or the removal of the lower bound to a fixed rate of 0.25%. Moving the rate by 12.5 basis points wouldn\u2019t be an unusual state of affairs given that this was done on a periodic basis in the 1980\u2019s, but it would fly in the face of market expectations, and would certainly be a case of back to the future. Over in Asia, shares have bounced overnight as investors digested the prospect of a US interest rate hike tonight. In Tokyo, the Nikkei reversed two days of losses to close 2.6% higher. And Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 bounced back from a three-year low, gaining 2.4%. The rally suggests that traders are pleased that the seemingly endless speculation over a Fed rate hike will probably end today. As Angus Nicholson of IG put it: The rally we are seeing in equity markets indicates that they are likely to respond well to a rate hike at the decision today as certainty in the direction of Fed policy should bring some stability to markets. City investors are approaching Fed Day in a cautious mood. The FTSE 100 is expected to inch up by around 5 points when trading begins, having surged by 143 points, or 2.45%, yesterday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The waiting is nearly over. In just under 12 hours time, America\u2019s central bank will announce whether it has taken the plunge and raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Today\u2019s Federal Reserve decision is the last major financial event of the year, and it really is a case of \u201call eyes on the Fed\u201d. A lot has happened since Ben Bernanke hiked interest rates in June 2006, to 5.25% \u2013 which may seem stratospheric to younger readers. A year later the credit crunch struck, followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the global recession, and unprecedented stimulus packages from the world\u2019s central bankers which left US interest rates at just 0%-0.25%. Investors are widely expecting the Fed to start tightening monetary policy today. But if that happens, Fed chair Janet Yellen will probably take a dovish tone when she addresses the media at a press conference. Yellen is likely to emphasise that future rate moves will remain \u201cdata-dependent\u201d, meaning borrowing costs will stay low for some time. But will that be enough to prevent fresh turmoil in the foreign exchange, equities and commodity markets? The start of the Fed tightening cycle will surely cause some ructions in the markets in the weeks ahead. Anticipation of a hike has already driven emerging market currencies down and driven junk bonds into dangerous territory. But there will surely also be some relief that the waiting is finally over. This saga has gone on long enough..... What else is afoot? The Fed decision really is the main event today. But we can while away the time with new surveys of the eurozone economy, the latest UK unemployment data, and a second estimate of euro inflation. 8am-9am GMT: Manufacturing and service reports from Germany, France and the eurozone 9.30am: UK unemployment for November 10am: Final estimate of eurozone inflation for November 7pm: Federal Reserve decision 7.30pm: Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference",

Turner, who also said UBS favored yield European bonds, said he thought further rate increases would not hurt economic growth domestically. \u201cWe expect the pace of tightening next year to be gradual, with four more hikes in 2016. Although this is more hawkish than the markets currently expect, we believe that the US economy will continue to expand.\u201d<br></p> <p> Turner also said the UK would likely follow suit. \u201cThe US interest rate rise is unlikely to influence the timing of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to hike rates,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHowever, it still looks as though the BoE will be the first central bank to follow the US, though the inflation and wage outlook over the next few months suggests they have time to wait.

Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year.</p> <p>Inflation has continued to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down.</p> <p>Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.</p> <p>Overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.</p> <p>The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective. </p> <p><strong>Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, </strong><strong>the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. </strong>The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.</p> <p>In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. </p> <p>In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.</p> <p>The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee\u2019s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-12-16T19:13:52.337Z\">at 7.13pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5671b479e4b0e7d11553d1f1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-16T19:01:22.616Z\">7.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fed hikes rate by 0.25%</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Interest rates will increase by 0.25%, the Federal Reserve has <a href=\"http://go.usa.gov/cKh3n\">announced</a>, the first hike after seven years of record lows. </p> <p>The Fed\u2019s statement on the increase says the decision is based on the economy \u201cexpanding at a moderate pace\u201d, with spending and investment increasing at \u201csolid rates\u201d and an improved housing sector.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.

At just 5%, it is close to the measure of \u2018full employment\u2019 where wages could soon spike (although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/dec/16/federal-reserve-us-interest-rates-janet-yellen-live#block-56713014e4b0a51f553ddb45\">today\u2019s UK employment report, showing record employment and lower wage growth, rather undermines that theory!</a>)</p> <p>Inflation is picking up (although at just 0.5% it\u2019s hardly red-hot). And there\u2019s the argument that a modest rate rise now reduces the danger that Janet Yellen has to aggressively hike in the future.</p> <p>But this is not an easy call. The Federal Reserve needs to consider the impact on the world economy. Huge amounts of capital flowed into emerging markets in recent years, and is now heading back to the US - destabilising developing economies and weakening their currencies. That could have a knock-in effect on the US economy, especially if a stronger dollar makes exports less attractive overseas.</p> <p>And while the US labour market looks solid at first glance, wage growth is still modest. And the proportion of people who have dropped out of the labour market is the highest since 1977.</p> <p>Ultimately, the Fed may conclude that raising rates today is simply less disruptive than shocking the markets by leaving them on hold.</p> <p><strong>This chart from the Economist (printed before yesterday\u2019s inflation data showed CPI had risen from 0.2% to 0.5%), outlines the issues in more detail:</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/statuses/676438197367345152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The case for and against an interest-rate hike <a href=\"https://t.co/FBvxXL62Qj\">https://t.co/FBvxXL62Qj</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/uQR98zuks6\">pic.twitter.com/uQR98zuks6</a></p>&mdash; The Economist (@TheEconomist) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/676438197367345152\">December 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-56715c5de4b0e92806774756\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-16T13:00:52.039Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Raising interest rates is not quite as simple a process as you might expect, especially if you\u2019re starting from zero.</strong></p> <p>The FT\u2019s <strong>Robin Wigglesworth </strong>has examined the process here, and explained why it might be bumpy.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://next.ft.com/content/30f6a3ba-9d14-11e5-b45d-4812f209f861\">How the US Federal Reserve intends to raise rates</a></h2> <p>As Robin explains, the Fed\u2019s traditional weapon is its \u201cfunds rate\u201d, which has been stuck at between zero and 0.25 per cent for exactly seven years.</p> <p>This rate determines how much commercial banks are paid to leave funds at the Fed\u2019s vaults.

In practice, the central bank\u2019s balance sheet does not shrink, but this sets a benchmark for cash interest rates paid by the Fed itself.

Half a decade ago, Santander was set to buy the 307 branches that Royal Bank of Scotland must sell to comply with the EU-imposed terms of its taxpayer-funded 2008 bailout.

The following year, RBS cooked up a complicated plan to bring in private equity partners, plus an investment wing of the Church of England, to speed up the branches\u2019 progress towards a stock market flotation. The chancellor, George Osborne, spoke fondly of how this new \u201cchallenger\u201d bank, to be rebadged as Williams &amp; Glyn, would give a leg-up to competition and diversity in UK banking. Now, after RBS has spent \u00a31.5bn trying to design and install software at Williams &amp; Glyn, we\u2019re back at square one. A sale is once again the preferred option and Santander is one likely name in the frame, along with Virgin Money. The timescale for this forced disposal is farcical, of course. It is evidence of the shocking level of under-investment in IT at RBS in its pre-crisis years. It should not have taken this long to achieve this little. The old software was too rigid and too antiquated. Yet, despite the circuitous journey, it is good news that there is interest in buying Williams &amp; Glyn. The uncomfortable truth is that, despite cheerleading from Osborne, few people expect any of the new crop of \u201cchallenger\u201d banks to alter the competitive landscape. Most of the new banks are too small, or too specialist, to create serious bother for the big four of Lloyds, RBS, HSBC and Barclays. Sceptics suspect backers\u2019 real goal is to be bought out, rather than to challenge. If that is so, it is probably better that Williams &amp; Glyn skips independent living altogether. It has more chance of contributing to competition if it is adopted by a second-tier player with ambitions to join the big league. Virgin has a respected management team. Santander, along with Nationwide, is a bank capable of throwing a few punches that are felt by the big beasts.

Mild weather cold comfort for Bonmarche Sooner or later a retailer was bound to grumble about how the mild weather is making it hard to flog winter coats and jumpers, and the dishonour goes to Bonmarch\u00e9. Cue a 29% fall in the share price as the womenswear chain predicted pre-tax profits would be \u00a310.5m-\u00a312.0m, versus \u00a312.4m a year ago. Weather \u2013 too hot, too cold, too rainy \u2013 is the oldest complaint in the retailing book, but one shouldn\u2019t be overly cynical on this occasion. A new coat is a deferrable purchase for most shoppers; if the deed isn\u2019t done by mid-December, the saving is mentally banked, or spent on something else. It\u2019s a safe bet that Bonmarch\u00e9 will not be the last clothing retailer to warn on weather. Mind you, retail executives are also muttering about other supposed difficulties. The Black Friday madness has changed buying habits; there was a drop-off in visits to shopping centres after the terrorist attacks in Paris; when Christmas Day falls on Friday, consumers always leave their buying to the final week; etcetera. Just the usual pre-Christmas nervousness in boardrooms? Possibly, but it feels more intense this year. Share prices are generally a decent guide and, with exceptions like Dixons Carphone, they\u2019re weak. Saxo Bank\u2019s magical predictions bad news for Silicon Valley unicorns Saxo Bank has the right approach to making forecasts for the year ahead: make them outrageous and try to provoke a debate. Inevitably, most turn out to be wide of the mark, as with last year\u2019s crop. The European Central Bank\u2019s president, Mario Draghi, did not resign in 2015, Russia did not default, UK house prices did not crash and Ukip did not become the third-largest party in parliament. But one or two of Saxo\u2019s punts are usually proved right, or half-right. For example: China did devalue the yuan, albeit not by 20%, and investors have started to run away from junk bonds. So, what about 2016\u2019s forecasts? Well, a landslide win for the Democrats doesn\u2019t really fit the \u201coutrageous\u201d tag. The oil price to return briefly to $100 a barrel definitely does. The Olympics turbo-charging a Brazilian recovery? Unlikely but, yes, plausible. But the canniest may be the prediction that some of those high-valued Silicon Valley startups \u2013 so-called unicorns, with lots of users but vague business models \u2013 will fall to Earth.

That\u2019s surely got to happen one of these years.</p>",

The quarter-point increase in borrowing costs could hardly be called a spur of the moment decision. On the contrary, the Fed has shown Hamlet-like indecision this year as it has weighed up the pros and cons of abandoning the zero interest rate policy that has been in force for the past seven years. Now, as Julius Caesar said when he crossed the Rubicon (with rather less dithering), the die is cast. The move is intended to signal that interest rates in the US will eventually return to normal. But not for some time, for this was \u2013 in the jargon of Wall Street \u2013 a dovish hike in interest rates. That sounds like an oxymoron, but means that the US central bank will take its time before moving again. In that respect, the key word in the Fed\u2019s statement was \u201cgradual\u201d. Financial markets would have been spooked had it talked about a \u201cmeasured\u201d increase in interest rates, because that would have suggested a repetition of the last cycle of US monetary tightening between 2004 and 2006, when there were 17 separate quarter-point jumps in the cost of borrowing. The drip-drip approach eventually killed off the housing boom and prompted the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Nobody expects a repeat of that, because much has changed since 2006. America\u2019s recovery has been weak by its own standards, the percentage of Americans working has fallen, and there is no real inflationary pressure. The new normal for interest rates is around 2%, not the 5%-plus they reached before the great recession. Wall Street took the decision by the US central bank to raise the cost of borrowing in its stride, and no wonder. This has been one of the best flagged interest rate decisions in history and the emollient language used by the Fed was exactly what traders had been expecting. The Fed\u2019s forecasts suggest there will be further increases next year, but these will be modest and intermittent, not least because inflation continues to undershoot. Some analysts have argued that the Fed should not be raising rates at all, and they have a case. The US economy is not very strong, with the manufacturing sector being hurt by a stronger dollar and faltering global demand. There is a risk that higher interest rates will hit consumer and business confidence if there is a fear of further hikes to come. There is also the risk of financial repercussions in those emerging markets with vulnerable currencies and where there has been excessive borrowing in dollars. The recent record for central banks that have raised interest rates since the crisis has not been impressive. The European Central Bank tried it but had second thoughts. So did the central banks of Sweden, Norway, Australia and Israel. In truth, the Fed had boxed itself in. It dropped broad hints that rates would go up in September, but got cold feet when the global markets fell sharply in August. It could not have led the markets on a second time without damaging its credibility. This was one of those occasions when the market reaction to doing nothing would have been more negative than the response to a rate increase.",

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday, ending an extraordinary period of government intervention in the financial markets that started at the height of the recession. After holding its benchmark federal-funds rate near zero for seven years, the Fed increased rates a quarter-percentage point. The move signals the end of a monetary policy that began amid the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. In a statement, the Fed said economic activity had been \u201cexpanding at a moderate pace. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further.\u201d Given the economic outlook, and \u201crecognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes\u201d, the Fed decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate a quarter point, the first such rise in close to a decade. The central bank signalled more increases to come \u201cwith gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy\u201d and argued that \u201ceconomic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen\u201d. At a press conference, Fed chair Janet Yellen said: \u201cThis action marks the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery of the economy from the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.\u201d She said the economy \u201chas come a long way\u201d, though normalization \u201cis likely to proceed gradually\u201d, and \u201cinflation continues to run below our longer-run objective\u201d. The US has now added new jobs every month since October 2010. In November, the economy added 211,000 jobs and has added an average of 237,000 jobs a month over the past 12 months. However, some have expressed concern about the move. Inflation appears to be under control \u2013 mitigating an imminent need to slow the economy by raising rates. And there are still signs of weakness in the jobs market, with historically high numbers of people no longer looking for work. Ahead of the meeting, Richard Trumka, president of the US\u2019s largest union federation, the AFL-CIO, urged the Fed to \u201cavoid making a mistake\u201d by raising interest rates. \u201cToo many working people are not feeling the economic recovery because of stagnant wages. In the months to come, the Fed should focus on the policy goal that real wages should rise with productivity. Working people deserve to lead better lives by sharing in the wealth we all create,\u201d he said. After the announcement, Senator Bernie Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, denounced the move as \u201cbad news for working families\u201d. \u201cAt a time when real unemployment is nearly 10% and youth unemployment is off the charts, we need to do everything possible to create millions of good-paying jobs and raise the wages of the American people. The Fed should act with the same sense of urgency to rebuild the disappearing middle class as it did to bail out Wall Street banks seven years ago,\u201d he wrote in a blogpost. Stock markets around the world had risen on anticipation of the move, a clear signal that the US has shaken off the aftermath of the last recession. The zero rate policy was introduced by Yellen\u2019s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, on 16 December 2008, exactly seven years ago. At the time, global stock markets were in turmoil following the bursting of a mortgage-backed financial bubble that triggered a global recession. Bernanke backed the zero rate move with a massive bond buying programme, spending billions to buy Treasury- and mortgage-backed bonds in a move aimed at keeping rates low and encouraging investment, a policy known as quantitative easing (QE). QE ended last October. Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at PNC, said the policy had been a success. \u201cIf you compare the US to other industrial economies, the recovery in the US has been better,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see proof of that in Japan and Europe now, where they have decided that QE is the way to go.\u201d The headline on this story originally said this was the first rise in interest rates since 2008. While it is the first increase since rates were brought down to zero in 2008, it is the first overall rise since 2006.",

      "bodyText": "A group of Labour MPs are to write to the prime minister to demand a cross-departmental investigation into the retailer Sports Direct, following revelations made by the Guardian last week. The latest effort to increase the pressure on the retailer came as the Institute of Directors weighed into the debate over working practices there. Iain Wright MP, chair of the business, innovation and skills select committee, said he would be writing to the group\u2019s billionaire founder, Mike Ashley, to discuss last week\u2019s reports. The new moves follow a Guardian investigation that revealed that thousands of Sports Direct workers were effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage. Undercover reporters found that the retailer\u2019s warehouse workers were subjected to an extraordinary regime of searches and surveillance, while local primary school teachers said pupils can remain in school while ill \u2013 and return home to empty houses \u2013 as parents working at Sports Direct are too frightened to take time off work. The reports have led to calls from both ends of the political spectrum for HM Revenue and Customs to investigate whether Sports Direct has breached national minimum wage legislation. On Monday, Nick Boles, a minister of state at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), was summoned to parliament to answer an urgent question on the topic filed by former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna. At a parliamentary meeting of MPs affiliated with the union Unite on Wednesday, attended by shadow ministers Emily Thornberry and Gloria de Piero, the group pledged to \u201cgo above the likes of Nick Boles\u201d. Ian Mearns, the MP for Gateshead, said: \u201cThere is enough evidence to say that this needs an urgent response. If we write to different arms of the government separately, they will trade one off against the other.\u201d He added that the group would ask David Cameron for a government response that included HMRC and the health and safety executive. In September, a Freedom of Information request made by the BBC revealed that ambulances were called to Sports Direct\u2019s headquarters more than 80 times in two years. Sports Direct said: \u201cSports Direct believes it\u2019s in compliance with minimum wage regulations and takes its responsibilities extremely seriously.\u201d Temporary workers at Sports Direct\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse are mostly hired through agencies, which technically employ the staff. Meanwhile, the IoD stepped up its own campaign to force changes at Sports Direct, after last week calling the firm \u201ca scar on British business\u201d. In a letter to the Guardian, Oliver Parry, senior corporate governance adviser at the IoD, wrote: \u201cThis is not a simple question of more regulation \u2013 it must begin with the institutional investors, the large fund managers who have continually backed Sports Direct over the years, irrespective of their governance or working conditions. They must take the up the challenge and engage with the Sports Direct board. If they do not, a wholesale change in the behaviour of the largest sports retailer in the UK is very hard to imagine.\u201d Outside shareholders in Sports Direct have indicated that they will attempt to oust non-executives from the company\u2019s board, a plan that looks more likely to succeed now that the company\u2019s share price has taken a hit. Since last week, when Sports Direct also reported disappointing trading figures, about \u00a3620m has been wiped off the company\u2019s value, with shares down around 15%. With a 55% stake in the company, Ashley\u2019s personal fortune has taken a hit of about \u00a3340m. The shares fell again on Wednesday, shedding 1.55% to close at 570.5p. The slump means that if a FTSE 100 reshuffle took place now instead of a fortnight ago, then Sports Direct would be relegated from the blue chip index. The next reshuffle will take place in just under three months\u2019 time. Wright said: \u201cI will certainly be writing to Mike Ashley to ask him to respond to these reports and explain how he and Sports Direct are fair and considerate employers who value workers who are employed in the company. \u201cThere is a wider issue revealed by the Guardian\u2019s high-quality reporting, in terms of what the future of work, employment contracts and workers\u2019 rights mean in Britain in 2015. This issue is at the core of what we want to do with the select committee in this parliament, namely that we work towards ensuring that we have productive and innovative companies who value their staff. This is something we will want to come back to in the very near future.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Interest rates rise: what does the Fed decision mean for you?", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Is something big happening at the Federal Reserve this week? Yup. The federal open market committee (FOMC) is meeting from Tuesday 15 December to Wednesday 16 December. During that time, members of the committee will discuss the unemployment situation, inflation and the global economy to determine if the US economy is strong enough for an interest-rate hike. They will announce their decision on Wednesday. Well, is the economy strong enough for a rate hike? According to the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, probably. The Fed has two main aims with interest rates \u2013 to encourage investment and job creation, and to control inflation. The unemployment rate is at 5% and in her testimony to Congress earlier this month, Yellen said she was also confident that inflation would return to 2%, which is the Fed\u2019s target. These all sound like good things. Why do we need to change things? There are signs that the US economy is \u2013 finally \u2013 shaking off the aftermath of 2008\u2019s recession. Part of that recovery was possible because the Fed kept the interest rates near zero. The opponents of interest-rate hikes want the Fed to hold off so that the economy can get even better. But the Fed is trying to do quite a balancing act here. We have been living in extraordinary times and the Fed wants to move back to more ordinary ones. If it waits too long there is the possibility that some markets will overheat (remember the housing bubble?) or inflation will take off. Over the past few months, Yellen has been making a case for a gradual increase in interest rates \u2013 warning against an abrupt \u201ctightening policy\u201d. \u201c[A]n abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession,\u201d she said at the beginning of this month. Here is a handy list of pros and cons from The Economist. When was the last time they increased interest rates? Isn\u2019t the Fed used to making these calls? The last time interest rates were raised was June 2006, a year before Apple rolled out the original iPhone. A whole generation of people have grown up with the idea that interest rates are close to zero. Yellen\u2019s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, raised rates just once in his entire tenure. I get that this is a big deal, but \u2026 what exactly happens when the Fed raises interest rates? According to Gus Faucher, senior macroeconomist at PNC Financial Services Group, there are two particular rates the Fed would look to increase. The first is the federal funds rate: that\u2019s the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans. The second is the interest rate on excess reserves, which the Fed pays to banks that have funds deposited at the Fed in excess of those funds required under law. The key is that these are very short-term rates. Any changes the Fed make will have little impact on longer-term rates, such as 30-year mortgage loans. Banks are likely to raise the prime rate (charged to their best corporate customers for short-term loans) to 3.25% to 3.50% in response to the Fed move. Other rates that are based on prime (including some on credit cards and some for student loans) will thus increase when the FOMC raises the Fed funds rate. Shorter-term rates, such as three-year car loans and lines of credit, will go up by more than longer-term rates. Faucher pointed out that the rate hike will be slow and change will be gradual. He expects the interest rate to go up .25 percentage points this month. This hike would be followed by three more such hikes in 2016. \u201cWe expect the Fed funds rate to move up by 1 percentage [point] through the end of 2016,\u201d he said. Most Americans have fixed-rate mortgages, so don\u2019t expect those rates to zoom up. But they will rise, as will the cost of borrowing for everyone, including Wall Street. The end of all that easy money will come slowly, but it could have a profound impact on an economy that has grown used to rock-bottom interest rates. Hold on. This sounds like I am not going to be making any money off this rate hike. Credit card interest rates are going up and so are student loans and car loans. What\u2019s in this for me? Depends where your money is \u2013 or if you have saved anything at all, anywhere. \u201cIf you have all your money in bank accounts/short-term money funds, you should start seeing more returns. However, if you own longer-term bonds, you could see some losses on the principal if yields rise,\u201d explained Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cEquities could go up or down based on history, although my guess is that Fed tightening is at least a bit of a negative for equities.\u201d Is there anyone who does not think we should raise interest rates? Elise Gould of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute believes the Fed should hold off for a while and wait until there are more full-time, better-paying jobs. After the US Department of Labor announced that the US economy had created 211,000 jobs in November and that the US unemployment rate remained at 5%, she said: We won\u2019t be at full employment until we see durable acceleration of wage growth, and only once we have achieved full employment will all workers be able to get the jobs they need and the hours they want, and be better positioned to negotiate for higher pay. Yes, interest rates have been low for a long time, but the Fed should not raise rates simply to scratch a seven-year itch. The Fed, however, considers a 5% unemployment rate to be pretty close to full employment. Wasn\u2019t there also a guy who said it was unnatural for things \u2013 including interest rates \u2013 to rise in the fall? You are thinking of California congressman Brad Sherman, who told Yellen: God\u2019s plan is not for things to rise in the autumn, as a matter of fact, that\u2019s why we call it fall, nor is it God\u2019s plan for things to rise in the winter, through the snow. God\u2019s plan is that things rise in the spring. And so if you want to be good with the Almighty, you might want to delay until May. For anyone who was not certain, the congressman later clarified that his remarks were a joke: OK, we have covered jokes and analysis. Is there anything else that I need to know? Well, before the September press conference, traders were passing around Yellen\u2019s horoscope. So maybe check that come Wednesday morning. Here is Yellen\u2019s forecast from this week (she\u2019s a Leo, by the way): \u201cDo not be afraid of change, accept it readily.\u201d",

The federal open market committee (FOMC) is meeting from Tuesday 15 December to Wednesday 16 December. During that time, members of the committee will discuss the unemployment situation, inflation and the global economy to determine if the US economy is strong enough for an interest-rate hike. They will announce their decision on Wednesday.</p> <p><strong>Well, is the economy strong enough for a rate hike?</strong></p> <p>According to the Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, probably. The Fed has two main aims with interest rates \u2013 to encourage investment and job creation, and to control inflation. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/04/us-economy-december-jobs-report-unemployment-rate\">unemployment rate is at 5%</a> and in her testimony to Congress earlier this month, Yellen said she was also confident that inflation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/03/janet-yellen-federal-reserve-interest-rate-hike-congress-economy\">would return to 2%</a>, which is the Fed\u2019s target.</p> <p><strong>These all sound like good things. Why do we need to change things?</strong></p> <p>There are signs that the US economy is \u2013 finally \u2013 shaking off the aftermath of 2008\u2019s recession. Part of that recovery was possible because the Fed kept the interest rates near zero. The opponents of interest-rate hikes want the Fed to hold off so that the economy can get even better. But the Fed is trying to do quite a balancing act here. We have been living in extraordinary times and the Fed wants to move back to more ordinary ones. If it waits too long there is the possibility that some markets will overheat (remember the housing bubble?) or inflation will take off.</p> <p>Over the past few months, Yellen has been making a case for a gradual increase in interest rates \u2013 warning against an abrupt \u201ctightening policy\u201d. \u201c[A]n abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession,\u201d she said at the beginning of this month. </p> <p>Here is a handy list of pros and cons from The Economist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/statuses/676438197367345152\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The case for and against an interest-rate hike <a href=\"https://t.co/FBvxXL62Qj\">https://t.co/FBvxXL62Qj</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/uQR98zuks6\">pic.twitter.com/uQR98zuks6</a></p>&mdash; The Economist (@TheEconomist) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheEconomist/status/676438197367345152\">December 14, 2015</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>When was the last time they increased interest rates? </strong><strong>Isn\u2019t the Fed used to making these calls? </strong></p> <p>The last time interest rates were raised was June 2006, a year before Apple rolled out the original iPhone.

The second is the interest rate on excess reserves, which the Fed pays to banks that have funds deposited at the Fed in excess of those funds required under law. The key is that these are very short-term rates. Any changes the Fed make will have little impact on longer-term rates, such as 30-year mortgage loans.</p> <p>Banks are likely to raise the prime rate (charged to their best corporate customers for short-term loans) to 3.25% to 3.50% in response to the Fed move. Other rates that are based on prime (including some on credit cards and some for student loans) will thus increase when the FOMC raises the Fed funds rate. Shorter-term rates, such as three-year car loans and lines of credit, will go up by more than longer-term rates. </p> </blockquote> <p>Faucher pointed out that the rate hike will be slow and change will be gradual. He expects the interest rate to go up .25 percentage points this month. This hike would be followed by three more such hikes in 2016. </p> <p>\u201cWe expect the Fed funds rate to move up by 1 percentage [point] through the end of 2016,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Most Americans have fixed-rate mortgages, so don\u2019t expect those rates to zoom up. But they will rise, as will the cost of borrowing for everyone, including Wall Street. The end of all that easy money will come slowly, but it could have a profound impact on an economy that has grown used to rock-bottom interest rates.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/us-money-blog/2015/sep/20/what-the-feds-game-of-chicken-means-for-your-money\">What the Fed's game of chicken means for your money</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Hold on.

However, if you own longer-term bonds, you could see some losses on the principal if yields rise,\u201d explained Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cEquities could go up or down based on history, although my guess is that Fed tightening is at least a bit of a negative for equities.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone who does <em>not</em> think we should raise interest rates?</strong></p> <p>Elise Gould of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute believes the Fed should hold off for a while and wait until there are more full-time, better-paying jobs. After the US Department of Labor announced that the US economy had created <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/04/us-economy-december-jobs-report-unemployment-rate\">211,000 jobs in November</a> and that the US unemployment rate remained at 5%, <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/press/still-too-soon-to-declare-victory/\">she said</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We won\u2019t be at full employment until we see durable acceleration of wage growth, and only once we have achieved full employment will all workers be able to get the jobs they need and the hours they want, and be better positioned to negotiate for higher pay. Yes, interest rates have been low for a long time, but the Fed should not raise rates simply to scratch a seven-year itch.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/09/us_unemployment-zip/giv-31114EQPL2XCCDYtd/\" data-alt=\"US unemployment rate\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/09/us_unemployment-zip/giv-31114EQPL2XCCDYtd/\">US unemployment rate</a> </figure>  <p>The Fed, however, considers a 5% unemployment rate to be pretty close to full employment. </p> <p><strong>Wasn\u2019t there also a guy who said it was unnatural for things \u2013 including interest rates \u2013 to rise in the fall? </strong></p> <p>You are thinking of California congressman Brad Sherman, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/04/janet-yellen-december-rate-hike-still-on-table\">who told Yellen</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> God\u2019s plan is not for things to rise in the autumn, as a matter of fact, that\u2019s why we call it fall, nor is it God\u2019s plan for things to rise in the winter, through the snow.

      "bodyText": "There are just nine days to go until Christmas Day. It should be the busiest and most lucrative time of the year on the high street, but the discount signs are vying for attention with the festive decorations. Many shoppers brought forward their Christmas shopping to cash in on the Black Friday discounts and made a record number of purchases online. And customers are leaving it later than ever in the now annual game of chicken with retailers, holding off purchases and waiting for stores to panic about their stock levels and slash prices. At the same time, many fashion retailers are struggling to offload piles of winter woollies as the unusually warm weather takes its toll on sales. After weeks of unseasonal conditions, temperatures could hit a record-breaking 17C (63F) in parts of the country this weekend, according to forecasters at the Weather Channel. Across the UK, according to analysts at the consultants Deloitte, discounts are currently averaging 41.8%. By this weekend, they say, the price cuts will have risen to 45%. In Kingston upon Thames in southwest London and in London\u2019s West End stores there is plenty of evidence of what retail experts forecast will be the deepest Christmas high street discounts since 2008, when the British banking system nearly collapsed and consumer confidence was shattered. In both locations the stores are adorned with red, yellow and green sale signs. The prices on knitwear and coats in particular have been slashed by as much as 50% in some stores. The warm weather has already pushed one retailer, Bonmarch\u00e9, into a pre-Christmas profit warning, and analysts believe others will follow. Earlier this week, analysts at UBS trimmed their profit forecasts for Next, Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams, N Brown and Halfords, saying \u201cthe promotional environment remained intense\u201d in the UK. Aside from the unusually warm temperatures, heavy rain and flooding have kept people away from the shops in the north and west of the country, while the terrorist attacks in Paris may also have dampened trading in central London. Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital, said this autumn had seen a sea change in the way shoppers spend, and described the last few weeks as a \u201cthreshold trading period for online non-food retailing in the UK, for which we see no going back and to which retail trading strategies need to adjust\u201d. Upmarket Kingston has one of the most internet-savvy shopping clienteles in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s very mild and it doesn\u2019t feel like Christmas,\u201d said Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, as he walked around the town centre. \u201cIt is busy, but not mobbed. And why should people rush? They know the shops will open late and it\u2019s still easy to shop online. You can still order this weekend and get things by Christmas.\u201d On Kingston\u2019s main shopping streets and in the Bentall centre, shoppers are choosing carefully where they buy. One of the busiest stores is the discount store Card Factory, which has shoppers lining the aisles to buy rolls of wrapping paper at three for \u00a31 and traditional Christmas cards. The shop is part of a trend that is likely to see discounters grab their biggest share yet of festive retail sales. That trend is at its most noticeable in food, where Aldi and Lidl now account for 10% of all grocery sales and are still growing rapidly at the cost of major chains including Tesco and Asda. But across the market, discounters are expected to gain share, with year-to-date growth of 12%, according to Barclaycard. Despite their pledges to cut back on discounting, both M&amp;S and Debenhams are running extensive promotions, while hardly a rail of bargains can be found in Next, Zara, Ted Baker, Jigsaw, Fat Face or JD Sports. The latter contrasts markedly with its biggest competitor, Sports Direct, where nearly every item has a discount sticker on it. Ironically, the only item the Guardian could find marked down in JD Sports\u2019 immaculate flagship Oxford Street store was an away shirt for Newcastle United \u2013 Sports Direct\u2019s boss Mike Ashley\u2019s team \u2013 down from \u00a350 to \u00a335. There are some chains, such as Gap, that seem stuck in a rut of festive discounting. The chain is offering discounts of up to 50% in what has become a Christmas tradition. \u201cThey can\u2019t seem to get off that track,\u201d says Bubb. Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group stores \u2013 Evans, Wallis, Dorothy Perkins and Topshop \u2013 are all shouting about 30% discounts, as they have done at this time for the past two years. Clearly this kind of activity has been planned to some extent, but the amount of clothing on the discount rails is much more extensive in Dorothy Perkins than in the other chains. In the brand\u2019s BHS outlet it is difficult to find a rail of clothes that isn\u2019t cut-price. BHS, which Green sold for \u00a31 earlier this year, is clearly not having a merry Christmas in Kingston or central London. The new owners got their red marker pen out for Black Friday and don\u2019t appear to have put it away. The windows have layers of discount signs \u2013 50% off Christmas gifts, knitwear and sleepwear, overlaying half price on cards and gift wrap. Bubb is more surprised by the extent of discounting on offer at the fashion chain H&amp;M. Its three-floor store in the Bentall centre is dominated by enormous sale signs, with discounts of up to 60%. Jeans are down to half price at \u00a315 and woven patterned jackets are down from \u00a339.99 to \u00a320. The retailer\u2019s shares took a dip this week after fears that its sales would be affected by the warm weather, and on Tuesday H&amp;M admitted that trading in November had been \u201cnegatively affected\u201d in many of its large European markets, which is likely to include the UK. As the UK\u2019s biggest retailer of knitwear, M&amp;S also appears to be suffering more than most from the mild autumn and winter. Its four-day \u201ccountdown to Christmas\u201d event, which offers 30% off items across the store \u2013 mainly jumpers, cardigans and some coats \u2013 has been extended to five days. There is also 50% off party wear, although that is more usual given that the party season generally peaks this weekend. \u201cIt suggests trading isn\u2019t great,\u201d says Bubb, adding that extending a sale is unlikely to go down well with shoppers. \u201cIf you bought yesterday because you thought it was the last day, then you would feel pushed into it,\u201d he says. In central London, Debenhams\u2019 Oxford Street store appears to have stepped into full sale mode just days ahead of one of the biggest shopping weekends of the year. It has 50% off knitwear, women\u2019s shoes, coats, partywear, toys and gadgets, as well as 30% off bags. Extra rails bulging with sweaters and coats are lining the edge of the womenswear floor, with several of the group\u2019s own-label brands \u2013 Red Herring, Mantaray and RJR John Rocha \u2013 covered in red labels. The privately owned womenswear labels Hobbs and Phase Eight also look overburdened with stock, offering up to 30% discounts, while the upmarket young fashion brand Jack Wills appears to be in panic mode, offering 25% off everything in the store. \u201cThey should never have to do that,\u201d says Bubb. \u201cOnce again retailers and consumers are playing a game of cat and mouse in the runup to Christmas \u2013 and it appears consumers are currently winning,\u201d says Neil Saunders, the head of the retail consultancy Conlumino. \u201cThere is no doubt that shoppers are leaving shopping later each year.\u201d When it\u2019s possible to order online for collection on Christmas Eve, shoppers are happy to wait for a potential bargain and let retailers bite their nails.",

In the brand\u2019s BHS outlet it is difficult to find a rail of clothes that isn\u2019t cut-price. </p> <p>BHS, which Green sold for \u00a31 earlier this year, is clearly not having a merry Christmas in Kingston or central London. The new owners got their red marker pen out for Black Friday and don\u2019t appear to have put it away. The windows have layers of discount signs \u2013 50% off Christmas gifts, knitwear and sleepwear, overlaying half price on cards and gift wrap. </p> <p>Bubb is more surprised by the extent of discounting on offer at the fashion chain H&amp;M. Its three-floor store in the Bentall centre is dominated by enormous sale signs, with discounts of up to 60%. Jeans are down to half price at \u00a315 and woven patterned jackets are down from \u00a339.99 to \u00a320.</p> <p>The retailer\u2019s shares took a dip this week after fears that its sales would be affected by the warm weather, and on Tuesday H&amp;M admitted that trading in November had been \u201cnegatively affected\u201d in many of its large European markets, which is likely to include the UK.</p> <p>As the UK\u2019s biggest retailer of knitwear, M&amp;S also appears to be suffering more than most from the mild autumn and winter. Its four-day \u201ccountdown to Christmas\u201d event, which offers 30% off items across the store \u2013 mainly jumpers, cardigans and some coats \u2013 has been extended to five days. There is also 50% off party wear, although that is more usual given that the party season generally peaks this weekend.</p> <p>\u201cIt suggests trading isn\u2019t great,\u201d says Bubb, adding that extending a sale is unlikely to go down well with shoppers. \u201cIf you bought yesterday because you thought it was the last day, then you would feel pushed into it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In central London, Debenhams\u2019 Oxford Street store appears to have stepped into full sale mode just days ahead of one of the biggest shopping weekends of the year. It has 50% off knitwear, women\u2019s shoes, coats, partywear, toys and gadgets, as well as 30% off bags. Extra rails bulging with sweaters and coats are lining the edge of the womenswear floor, with several of the group\u2019s own-label brands \u2013 Red Herring, Mantaray and RJR John Rocha \u2013 covered in red labels.</p> <p>The privately owned womenswear labels Hobbs and Phase Eight also look overburdened with stock, offering up to 30% discounts, while the upmarket young fashion brand Jack Wills appears to be in panic mode, offering 25% off everything in the store. \u201cThey should never have to do that,\u201d says Bubb.</p> <p>\u201cOnce again retailers and consumers are playing a game of cat and mouse in the runup to Christmas \u2013 and it appears consumers are currently winning,\u201d says Neil Saunders, the head of the retail consultancy Conlumino. \u201cThere is no doubt that shoppers are leaving shopping later each year.\u201d <br></p> <p>When it\u2019s possible to order online for collection on Christmas Eve, shoppers are happy to wait for a potential bargain and let retailers bite their nails.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Electrical retailer Dixons Carphone is expecting record Boxing Day sales even after experiencing its busiest day ever on Black Friday. Sebastian James, chief executive of the group that owns Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse in the UK, said Christmas now had \u201ctwin peaks\u201d. He admitted the company was experiencing a lull before the traditionally busy Boxing Day sales but said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that the group would see revenue growth over the whole festive period. \u201cI said last year that Christmas is a two humped camel and the humps have got higher and the gaps lower,\u201d he said. The group sold five items a second online during the peak period between 8am and 9am on Black Friday \u2013 the US inspired discount day, which fell on 27 November this year \u2013 up 56% on last year. TVs, NutriBullets and fitness trackers sold well, helping the company grab market share from rivals including Argos, which suffered from delivery problems over the Black Friday period. James said the groups\u2019 stores in Nordic countries and southern Europe as well as the UK had enjoyed their biggest days trading ever as the Black Friday phenomena spread across the continent. He said that there had been a sharp rise in the number of people making purchases online, but just under half of those had chosen to pick their items up in stores so that close to 80% of Black Friday shoppers had entered stores at some point. Dixons\u2019 experience runs counter to reports that online retailers\u2019 enjoyed the bulk of Black Friday sales. \u201cStores are still a critical part of the distribution channel,\u201d James said. The Dixons Carphone boss commented on the strong Black Friday trading as the group revealed better than expected profits for the first half of its financial year. Underlying pre-tax profit for the six months to the end of October rose 23% to \u00a3121m as UK sales boomed, beating analysts\u2019 average forecast of \u00a3111m. Televisions and white goods such as fridges sold well, making up for weaker sales of tablet computers and laptops. Sales at established UK and Irish stores rose 4% in the three months to the end of October, a slow down from the previous quarter. But profits in the UK soared 31% to \u00a3101m as it cut costs, and improved efficiency, partly by merging the head offices of the formerly separate Dixons and Carphone Warehouse groups. Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse stores are also being merged into single units. The group is closing 20-30 stores a year with an aim to reduce its portfolio of 400 outlets to just over 300 over time. With a week until Christmas, analysts homed in on Dixon\u2019s comments about recent trading. The shares rose as much as 5% to a record high of 500p and were up 1.76% to 485p by the end of the day. The company, formed from the merger of Dixons and Carphone Warehouse last year, also announced a board revamp. Lord Livingston, the former chief executive of BT and Conservative trade minister, has become deputy chairman, replacing Roger Taylor, the former Carphone Warehouse boss. Livingston\u2019s appointment is his second board job this week after he was announced as chairman of Man Group, the hedge fund. He started his retail career at Dixons in the early 1990s and became finance director before moving to BT. Tony DeNunzio, chairman of Pets at Home and the former boss of Asda, has joined as a non-executive director, replacing John Gildersleeve.",

    "webTitle": "VW gets go-ahead to repair diesel cars affected by emissions scandal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Volkswagen has secured regulatory approval to repair diesel cars affected by the emissions scandal and will begin work in January. The German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has given VW the green light to install software and a flow transformer device, part of the air intake system, into the 8.5m diesel engines in Europe that contain software designed to cheat emissions tests. VW has previously admitted installing defeat devices in 11m vehicles worldwide. It faces the prospect of paying tens of billions of euros in fines and compensation to customers. Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch, the VW chairman, admitted there had been a \u201cwhole chain\u201d of errors at the German carmaker and a mindset within the company that tolerated rule-breaking. VW will begin the process of repairing vehicles early next year by sending letters to motorists. This letter will advise customers that their vehicles are scheduled to be repaired but to await further instructions. A second letter will then tell affected motorists to contact a local engineer in \u201cgood time\u201d to fix their vehicle. Vehicles with a 1.2-litre or 2-litre engine will be fixed with a software update that can be installed in less than 30 minutes. However, 1.6-litre cars will require a new part to be placed in the vehicle, which will take less than an hour. The recall will begin with 2-litre cars in the first quarter of 2016, followed by 1.2-litre cars in the second quarter and 1.6-litre cars in the third quarter. VW has said it will provide compensation for customers for any fall in the residual value of their car, but the German company is yet to announce its plans. Customers will be provided with a free hire-car while their vehicle is being repaired. The European parliament plans to investigate the carmaker, and the failure of regulators to prevent the rigging of diesel emissions tests. MEPs will vote on Thursday whether to launch the investigation, regarded as a formality. Claude Turmes, a Green MEP, said: \u201cThe diesel issue mainly has two dimensions. Firstly, it\u2019s about private companies organising the largest industrial fraud ever, and secondly, it\u2019s about public authorities in member states and on the EU level not intervening despite having relevant information.\u201d",

This letter will advise customers that their vehicles are scheduled to be repaired but to await further instructions. A second letter will then tell affected motorists to contact a local engineer in \u201cgood time\u201d to fix their vehicle.</p> <p>Vehicles with a 1.2-litre or 2-litre engine will be fixed with a software update that can be installed in less than 30 minutes. However, 1.6-litre cars will require a new part to be placed in the vehicle, which will take less than an hour.</p> <p>The recall will begin with 2-litre cars in the first quarter of 2016, followed by 1.2-litre cars in the second quarter and 1.6-litre cars in the third quarter.</p> <p>VW has said it will provide compensation for customers for any fall in the residual value of their car, but the German company is yet to announce its plans. Customers will be provided with a free hire-car while their vehicle is being repaired.</p> <p>The European parliament plans to investigate the carmaker, and the failure of regulators to prevent the rigging of diesel emissions tests. MEPs will vote on Thursday whether to launch the investigation, regarded as a formality.</p> <p> Claude Turmes, a Green MEP, said: \u201cThe diesel issue mainly has two dimensions. Firstly, it\u2019s about private companies organising the largest industrial fraud ever, and secondly, it\u2019s about public authorities in member states and on the EU level not intervening despite having relevant information.\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "SuperGroup has said it has opted out of heavy discounting on the high street and is set for a successful Christmas, dismissing speculation that it was suffering tough trading. The owner of the Superdry brand, worn by David Beckham and represented by the actor Idris Elba, reported first-half underlying pre-tax profit up 54% to \u00a319.3m as sales at stores open a year or more rose 17% and online sales rose 19%. Statutory pre-tax profit, including the reduced value of stock acquired when SuperGroup bought out the licence for its ailing US business, fell by a third to \u00a311.5m. SuperGroup\u2019s shares fell heavily on Tuesday after an analyst\u2019s note suggested the company could be struggling to compete with deep discounts at other retailers. The analyst said SuperGroup had cut prices and could be left with more stock than expected because of unusually warm weather. Euan Sutherland, its chief executive, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t really recognise some of the facts were in the note. Our promotional participation is very low. It\u2019s less than 10% of sales and it\u2019s slightly lower year on year. Our stock levels are slightly lower year on year and our quality of stock has gone up.\u201d SuperGroup\u2019s shares rose by 17% to \u00a317 on Wednesday. The shares have doubled in value in the past year. Christmas shoppers are predicted to benefit from the biggest discounts by retailers since 2008, according to a survey published on Tuesday. With little more than a week left until Christmas day, discounts average 42% and will rise to 45% by the weekend, Deloitte calculated. Sutherland said SuperGroup offered 20% discount on certain items for short periods of time but had shunned mass discounting to get tills ringing. Its equivalent figure to those in the Deloitte survey was around 5%, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to respond to what is on the high street too much. Across the high street you will see at Mango, Top Shop and Wallis 20, 30, 40 or 50% off everything. What we do is such a narrow amount of product on a rotating basis before Christmas. We are well set for Christmas.\u201d Sutherland, who joined in November 2014 after walking out as boss of the Co-operative Group, said he was comfortable with analysts\u2019 average forecast for annual underlying profit of \u00a372m. He has had a volatile first year, announcing a profit warning before last Christmas before a burst of cold weather revived sales. Sutherland said he was not concerned about this year\u2019s warm weather in the run-up to Christmas and that sales of new women\u2019s and gym ranges were doing well. In the first half, increased margins were offset partly by slower progress than expected in overhauling the US business, which SuperGroup bought from the licensee last year. Sutherland said SuperGroup missed out on some pre-Christmas US sales as it revamped stores and installed new management. The company has hired Elba, known for appearing in The Wire and Luther, to design a premium range and represent the brand in the US.",

      "bodyText": "Deliveroo, the upmarket food-delivery group, and the Crowdcube crowdfunding site are among 15 firms tipped as potential stars of the UK\u2019s digital economy by Tech City UK, a government-backed organisation. The companies have been inducted into the Future Fifty programme, which aims to support fast-growing tech firms and help them to the next stage. London\u2019s role as a leading centre for financial technology groups is highlighted by the fact that there are three companies from the sector among the graduating companies \u2013 Crowdcube, iwoca and FundApps. Not all of the new entrants are based in the capital. This year\u2019s additions include Brandwatch, a data and analytics group in Brighton, and the Floow, a Sheffield-based telematics company. Gerard Grech, Tech City UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cBritain\u2019s digital industry continues to defy expectation. From fintech [financial technology] to online shopping, cybersecurity to gaming, the Future Fifty companies reflect the diversity of our fastest-growing sector. In a rich and varied marketplace, these entrepreneurs are united by global ambition and enormous potential. The digital businesses joining the Future Fifty programme are a window into the future of the digital economy.\u201d The elevation of 15 new companies marks the end of the road for another 15 which have been on the programme since the beginning in 2013. They are said to have graduated and therefore have left the programme. The graduates include Unruly, the digital advertising group that was bought by News Corp for \u00a3114m; Naked Wines, which was bought by Majestic Wines for \u00a370m; Hailo, a smartphone app used by black-cab drivers in their increasingly bitter battle with Uber; and Funding Circle, an online marketplace that lends to small businesses and was valued at more than $1bn (\u00a3670m) during a recent fundraising. Since the programme was founded, the Future Fifty companies have raised a total of \u00a3791m and operate in 170 countries. Tech City UK was set up to support tech start-ups as many British businesses struggle to gain access to funds compared with their US counterparts. In an effort to make it more attractive for tech companies to float in the capital, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) established the high growth segment in 2013. Its rules allow for companies to have a smaller free float of shares (just 10% compared with the norm of 25%). Only two companies have made use of these rules, Just Eat and Matomy, while others, such as King Digital Entertainment, maker of Candy Crush Saga, secured a $7.1bn float in the US instead last year (it has since been bought by American company Activision for $5.9bn). There is still a view that US markets are happier to take a longer-term view of a company\u2019s profits potential. The LSE says four UK-based technology companies floated in London in 2015, led by Sophos Group, which raised \u00a3405m, and Softcat, which raised \u00a3176.4m.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Leading shares recorded their second day of gains as investors decided to take the long-awaited US interest rate rise - due after the UK market closed - in their stride. But there were some exceptions. Arm was the biggest faller, down 31p to \u00a310.21 on concerns about slowing sales for Apple\u2019s iPhone, which uses the Cambridge company\u2019s designs. There have been growing suggestions that the overall smartphone market is under pressure, while Arm has also been hit by recent disappointing updates from semiconductor group Dialog and graphic chip specialist Imagination Technologies, 22.5p lower at 123.5p. Investors ignored a positive note on Arm from Credit Suisse, which raised its target price from \u00a311.75 to \u00a312.30. The bank said: Following smartphone market seeing 28%/10% unit growth in 2014/2015, we now expect unit growth slowing to 5%/4%/4% in 2016/2017/2018 (6%/10% lower volumes in 2016/2017 versus our previous estimates) as smartphone market becomes more saturated (3.3bn smartphone subs ending 2015 on our estimate of 5.3bn long term total available market implying 63% penetration). As such, we lower our 2016/2017 revenue (dollar) and earnings per share estimates for Arm by 3%/4% and 3%/6%, and also introduce 2018 earnings per share of 44.2p. However, with royalty rates on the rise and long term opportunity around networking, internet of things and auto, we believe Arm can deliver around 10% sales and 15% earnings per share compound annual growth rate over 2015-2018. As such, we reiterate our outperform rating. Sports Direct, criticised for the treatment of workers at its warehouse, continued its recent slide, down another 9p at 570.5p. It was in no danger of being kicked out of the FTSE 100 at the index reshuffle earlier this month but now, just two weeks later, its shares have fallen so far it would be relegated to the FTSE 250 based on the current share price. Overall the FTSE 100 finished 43.40 points higher at 6061.19, despite another fall in the oil price. Investors were more concerned with the Fed, and Connor Campbell at Spreadex said: The markets appear to be prepping themselves for the announcement of a rate-hike and with it some much needed clarity. Any questions surrounding tonight\u2019s announcement are now more focused on how fast the Fed will raise rates, rather than if they will raise rates at all, with analysts arguably looking for a \u2018dovish hike\u2019 and plenty of reassurance that Yellen and co will be taking things slowly. Of course the central bank still has the capacity to disappoint, though there seems to be more certainty from analysts and investors this time around when compared to the last feasible moment for lift-off back in September. Among the UK risers Pearson, under pressure of late on concerns about the outlook, added 36.5p to 743.5p after both Exane BNP Paribas and Bernstein issued upbeat notes on the publisher. Elsewhere Dixons Carphone added 8.4p to 485.1p following its figures, while SuperGroup soared 12% or 184p to \u00a317 as its half year results beat expectations - the shares were hit earlier this week by a Liberum downgrade. But supermarkets fell back on further consideration of Tuesday\u2019s market share figures from Kantar Worldpanel, with Tesco down 1.3p at 148p. Other retailers slipped back on concerns about the outlook for Christmas, with prices being slashed to encourage shoppers. Womenswear retailer Bonmarche slumped 29% to 210.5p after it warned that profits would be lower than previously expected after challenging trading conditions since Black Friday in November, and it believed these would continue for the remainder of the winter season. At the same time it announced the departure of chief executive Beth Butterwick after four years. The cautious trading comments from Bonmarche sent Marks &amp; Spencer 2.4p lower to 460.2p and Next down 60p to \u00a374.45. Clive Black at Shore Capital said: We do not believe that Bonmarche\u2019s warning and disappointment will be the last to be recorded by British retailers with a high participation in the fourth quarter and the festive season. [Challenging] conditions mean that we await the January trading updates with increasing nervousness surrounding the robustness of present earnings forecasts for the non-food retailers. At the weekend we noted window discounting clothing at Marks &amp; Spencer, which underscores the nervousness from a general merchandising perspective, albeit the group\u2019s food business if the Nielsen &amp; Kantar data are to be believed, is flying. We have not had high hopes for sales for M&amp;S UK general merchandising but can the recently robust gross margins hold up? In this respect, can the mighty Next also withstand the aforementioned processes? Mulberry dipped 1p to 917.5p after news that the luxury handbag specialist\u2019s finance director Roger Mather had recently raised \u00a3540,000 by selling 59,000 shares at an average price of 913.5p a share. But Rolls-Royce rose 26.5p to 566.5p as the aero-engine maker announced it was scrapping a layer of senior management as part of its turnaround plan. Online gaming group bwin.party digitial jumped 7.7p to 124.4p ahead of its expected takeover by GVC, 26p better at 441p. Citigroup issued a positive note on both companies, saying: We argue that GVC\u2019s reverse take-over of bwin.party should drive multiple upsides: substantial value creation from the \u20ac125m cost savings; a broader spread of geographic, regulatory and product risk; around 11% free cash flow yield and around 8% dividend yield in 2017; a more than \u00a31bn proforma market capitalisation and move to the main market (with FTSE 250 inclusion targeted in mid-2016). We initiate with a 580p price target for GVC. We also upgrade bwin.party to buy (from sell) with a new 159p price target (from 65p) to reflect the terms of its acquisition by GVC. Deal completion is due in early 2016. Housebuilders came under pressure after a downbeat note from Liberum, with Persimmon down 18p at \u00a319.52 and Taylor Wimpey off 0.6p at 198.1p. Liberum said: We turned more cautious on housebuilders in early November. We see the valuations of the three largest builders coming under pressure if gross margins peak in 2016 as selling price inflation cools but cost inflation does not. Our view has not changed as the autumn statement changes are mixed for the sector and the Financial Policy Committee\u2019s inaction is a delay rather than a cancellation.",

      "body": "<p>Leading shares recorded their second day of gains as investors decided to take the long-awaited US interest rate rise - due after the UK market closed - in their stride.</p> <p>But there were some exceptions. <strong>Arm</strong> was the biggest faller, down 31p to \u00a310.21 on concerns about slowing sales for Apple\u2019s iPhone, which uses the Cambridge company\u2019s designs. There have been growing suggestions that the overall smartphone market is under pressure, while Arm has also been hit by recent disappointing updates from semiconductor group Dialog and graphic chip specialist <strong>Imagination Technologies</strong>, 22.5p lower at 123.5p.</p> <p>Investors ignored a positive note on Arm from Credit Suisse, which raised its target price from \u00a311.75 to \u00a312.30. The bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following smartphone market seeing 28%/10% unit growth in 2014/2015, we now expect unit growth slowing to 5%/4%/4% in 2016/2017/2018 (6%/10% lower volumes in 2016/2017 versus our previous estimates) as smartphone market becomes more saturated (3.3bn smartphone subs ending 2015 on our estimate of 5.3bn long term total available market implying 63% penetration).</p> <p>As such, we lower our 2016/2017 revenue (dollar) and earnings per share estimates for Arm by 3%/4% and 3%/6%, and also introduce 2018 earnings per share of 44.2p. However, with royalty rates on the rise and long term opportunity around networking, internet of things and auto, we believe Arm can deliver around 10% sales and 15% earnings per share compound annual growth rate over 2015-2018. As such, we reiterate our outperform rating.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sports Direct</strong>, criticised for the treatment of workers at its warehouse, continued its recent slide, down another 9p at 570.5p. It was in no danger of being kicked out of the FTSE 100 at the index reshuffle earlier this month but now, just two weeks later, its shares have fallen so far it would be relegated to the FTSE 250 based on the current share price.<br></p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100 </strong>finished 43.40 points higher at 6061.19, despite another fall in the oil price. Investors were more concerned with the Fed, and Connor Campbell at Spreadex said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The markets appear to be prepping themselves for the announcement of a rate-hike and with it some much needed clarity. Any questions surrounding tonight\u2019s announcement are now more focused on how fast the Fed will raise rates, rather than if they will raise rates at all, with analysts arguably looking for a \u2018dovish hike\u2019 and plenty of reassurance that Yellen and co will be taking things slowly. Of course the central bank still has the capacity to disappoint, though there seems to be more certainty from analysts and investors this time around when compared to the last feasible moment for lift-off back in September.</p> </blockquote> <p>Among the UK risers <strong>Pearson</strong>, under pressure of late on concerns about the outlook, added 36.5p to 743.5p after both Exane BNP Paribas and Bernstein issued upbeat notes on the publisher.<br></p> <p>Elsewhere <strong>Dixons Carphone</strong> added 8.4p to 485.1p following its figures, while <strong>SuperGroup</strong> soared 12% or 184p to \u00a317 as its half year results beat expectations - the shares were hit earlier this week by a Liberum downgrade.</p> <p>But supermarkets fell back on further consideration of Tuesday\u2019s market share figures from Kantar Worldpanel, with <strong>Tesco </strong>down 1.3p at 148p.</p> <p>Other retailers slipped back on concerns about the outlook for Christmas, with prices being slashed to encourage shoppers.</p> <p>Womenswear retailer <strong>Bonmarche</strong> slumped 29% to 210.5p after it warned that profits would be lower than previously expected after challenging trading conditions since Black Friday in November, and it believed these would continue for the remainder of the winter season. At the same time it announced the departure of chief executive Beth Butterwick after four years.</p> <p>The cautious trading comments from Bonmarche sent <strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> 2.4p lower to 460.2p and <strong>Next </strong>down 60p to \u00a374.45. Clive Black at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We do not believe that Bonmarche\u2019s warning and disappointment will be the last to be recorded by British retailers with a high participation in the fourth quarter and the festive season.</p> <p>[Challenging] conditions mean that we await the January trading updates with increasing nervousness surrounding the robustness of present earnings forecasts for the non-food retailers.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Santander has emerged as a potential bidder for 307 branches being put up for sale by Royal Bank of Scotland, which is scrambling to comply with rules imposed by the EU after its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout. In the latest chapter in the long-running saga to sell the branches, which are being rebranded Williams &amp; Glyn, RBS is going to auction them off while continuing to pursue a stock market flotation for the operation. If RBS \u2013 74% owned by the taxpayer \u2013 decides to sell the branches rather than float them on the stock market, it could be faced with multimillion-pound bill to compensate its current partners in the network, which has 1.8 million customers with \u00a320bn of loans and \u00a324bn of deposits. The sell-off was imposed by the EU, in a similar way in which Lloyds Banking Group split off more than 600 branches under the resurrected TSB brand and floated the business on the stock market in 2014. TSB has since been sold to Sabadell of Spain. RBS has been working on the flotation since 2013 with a consortium led by private equity firm Corsair capital and including the Church Commissioners, which manage \u00a36.7bn of investments for the Church of England. Under the terms of that complex deal, the consortium would have been left with a stake of up to 49% after the stock market flotation. The consortium has also been receiving up to \u00a384m a year in interest payments on a bond used to fund the transaction. It is thought that a break-clause would also be included unleashing further payouts from RBS, which has incurred costs of about \u00a31.5bn to carve out the Williams &amp; Glyn (W&amp;G) network. The sell-off of the branches is much delayed, and was originally supposed to take place before the end of 2013 under terms agreed with the EU at the time of the RBS bailout. But that timetable was abandoned when Santander pulled out of buying the branches in 2012, forcing RBS to then pursue the stock market offering. However, Santander appears to be back in the running. While not commenting on the speculation directly, a spokesperson for the bank said: \u201cWe will continue to analyse opportunities in our core 10 markets where they add value and benefit to our customers and shareholders. That said, we do not comment on rumours.\u201d Virgin Money, which bought part of Northern Rock off the government in 2011, is also regarded as a potential contender. It declined to comment. RBS must sell the business by the end of 2017. Any trade buyer may not want to use the W&amp;G name, which was going to be reintroduced on the high street next year. It was last used in 1986 and the bank has been working on a new look for branches, which are intended to act as a new competitive force on the high street. In May, the government had asked the Competition and Markets Authority to examine the impact W&amp;G would have on the banking market, which is dominated by RBS, Lloyds, HSBC and Barclays. But the government has since asked for that review to be suspended while the bid process is pursued. In a stock market announcement, RBS said: \u201cThe strategic attractiveness of Williams &amp; Glyn has been reflected in a number of informal approaches for the business. Therefore while continuing preparations for an [initial public offering], we are planning to launch a trade sale process in first half of 2016, and targeting the signing of a binding agreement to sell the business by year end 2016, with full divestment by the end of 2017.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 December 2015. An earlier version gave a figure of \u00a35.5bn for the Church of England\u2019s investments. That was the value of the portfolio in 2013; by the end of 2014, the latest date for which a figure is available, it had grown to \u00a36.7bn.",

      "bodyText": "The accountancy watchdog has told MPs it is continuing to review whether it should investigate the auditing of HBOS by accountants at KPMG. In a letter to Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, the regulator has also pledged to set out the reasons for any decision not to formally investigate KPMG after completing the review. The review has been triggered by the publication last month of an official report into what went wrong at HBOS. In that report it emerged that the Financial Reporting Council, which polices accountants and auditors, had decided there were \u201cnot reasonable grounds to suspect that there may have been misconduct\u201d in relation to the auditing of the HBOS corporate loan book. The FRC is only usually required to disclose that an investigation has begun and not why one has not been initiated. In setting out its reasons not to investigate, the regulator is addressing the public interest in the collapse of HBOS seven years ago. The FRC\u2019s promise to explain its decision was made in response to a letter from Tyrie. In the letter he said: \u201cIt is now essential \u2013 in the interests of public confidence \u2013 that the FRC get on with this investigation, and without delay.\u201d On Tuesday, Tyrie said the decision not to investigate was getting \u201ccuriouser and curiouser\u201d. The FRC has also rebutted criticism that it had decided against an investigation without receiving all the evidence.",

The company said profits would be up to 22% below expectations after mild autumn weather triggered \u201cvery challenging\u201d trading conditions. \u201cThe board\u2019s view is that these trading conditions are likely to continue for the remainder of the winter season,\u201d it said as the retailer warned it was likely to deliver annual pre-tax profits of between \u00a310.5m and \u00a312m, rather than the \u00a313.4m expected by analysts. Concerns that unseasonal temperatures could dent profits at other clothing retailers dragged down the shares of Debenhams, Marks &amp; Spencer, N Brown and Asos on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe do not believe that Bonmarch\u00e9\u2019s warning and disappointment will be the last to be recorded by British retailers with a high participation in the [final three months of the year] and the festive season,\u201d said Clive Black, a retail analyst at Shore Capital. Shoppers are expected to benefit from the biggest high street discounts since 2008 averaging 41.8%, according to analysts at consultants Deloitte, as a result of the bad weather and a disappointing Black Friday performance on the high street. M&amp;S extended a four-day sale event by an extra day this week, offering discounts on knitwear, while Debenhams is offering up to 50% on coats, knitwear, gadgets, games and footwear. The number of shoppers visiting non-food stores fell 2.6% last week compared with the same week in 2014, according to Ipsos Retail Performance, the analysis firm. Bad weather has kept people away from the shops in the north and west of the country, which has suffered from flooding, while relatively warm weather has meant shoppers are not inclined to buy coats and sweaters. Black said the terrorist attacks in Paris may also have dampened trading in central London. \u201cSuch conditions mean that we await the January trading updates with increasing nervousness surrounding the robustness of present earnings forecasts for the non-food retailers,\u201d he added. Bonmarch\u00e9\u2019s shares dropped 87.5p to 210p after the company said the chief executive, Beth Butterwick, was leaving to join the Karen Millen chain. The chairman, John Coleman, said Butterwick had \u201cimbued Bonmarche\u0301 with a sense of energy and purpose\u201d as he thanked her for an \u201cexceptional contribution\u201d over four years at the business.",

      "bodyText": "If one company caught the zeitgeist in 2015 then it\u2019s probably Uber, the app-powered taxi-booking firm. It has become the leitmotif of the \u201cgig economy\u201d, attracting enormous coverage and popularity as well as a fair amount of hostility. A key source of tension concerns its relationship with its drivers: are they right to be treated as so-called partners, in effect self-employed contractors, or are they really employees with workplace rights? Get ready to hear a lot about this in 2016. Lawyers around the world are busy working on it. The answer will not affect only Uber, it could shape the future of the on-demand economy. A recent ruling in California determined that an Uber driver should be viewed as an employee and a wider class action is under way. In the UK, the GMB union is bringing a similar case on behalf of drivers, arguing they are wrongly being denied workplace rights such as the minimum wage, paid leave and rest breaks. Their lawyer, Nigel Mackay, says Uber is in effect an employer controlling hiring, firing and paying drivers as well as shaping key elements of their work such as charging and routing. Whichever way the judgment goes, there is an underlying question as to whether flexible \u201cgig\u201d forms of work fit neatly into traditional categories of employment law. Some maintain that our existing framework remains fit for purpose: strip away the gee-whizzery of online apps and the underlying legal issues that determine whether someone should be treated as an employee or a contractor are unchanged. Others disagree, arguing that technology platforms are enabling workers and consumers to come together in new ways that alter the character of the employment relationship and challenge our policy and legal framework: 21st-century technology is racing ahead of 20th-century institutions. That\u2019s exactly the debate that has just ignited in the US. One spark was a call last month from a powerful coalition of progressive tech leaders, unions and philanthropists calling for the creation of a new and flexible system of worker protection based on portable benefits. Another was this week\u2019s landmark vote by Seattle city council permitting self-employed drivers to unionise \u2013 the first US city to do so and a move that will be contested by Uber. All this comes alongside a heavily publicised proposal for the creation of a system of worker protection for the gig economy by two Democrat big hitters \u2013 Alan Krueger, a former chair of the White House\u2019s council of economic advisers, and Seth Harris, a former labour secretary. It argues a hybrid category of \u201cindependent worker\u201d is needed to accommodate situations in which an \u201cemployer\u201d exerts control over much of what a worker does at the same time as the individual retains the right (like the self-employed) to work as much or as little as they want, when they want. The conclusion is that a raft of established rights should be extended to the on-demand workforce: compulsory employer contributions for healthcare, the right to organise a union and anti-discrimination laws, and so on. Controversially, however, it also argued that \u2013 as with the self-employed \u2013 the minimum wage should be waived on the basis that the nature of on-demand work often makes it very hard to reliably measure hours undertaken. Whatever your take on the exact proposal, the underlying objective \u2013 ensuring that any gains to society arising from gig-type activity reflect genuine innovation and service improvement, rather than regulatory arbitrage at the expense of workers \u2013 is surely the right one. The US debate does not, of course, translate into the UK\u2019s very different legal and welfare system \u2013 for instance, we already have an intermediate status for so-called workers falling between employees and the self-employed, though whether it any better suits the realities of gig-type working is unclear. For now, we remain in limbo as we wait to find out whether Uber will facedisruption, in the form of a verdict forcing it to comply with workplace rights. Meanwhile, like the US, we should be thrashing out the underlying questions. Might it be possible to craft forms of protection that give greater security to gig workers without destroying desirable features of these new business models? Or would any gains be outweighed by the risk that larger numbers of other workers, in traditional sectors, get shunted into any new, less protected employment status? Ill-judged reform could mean more levelling down than up. The gig economy is much smaller than the hype suggests. As it matures out of its noisy, insurgent phase it needs to find a better accommodation with the workers that power it. Right now, this takes the form of efforts to apply traditional employment law. In time, new forms of protection and worker organisation will be needed. Just as business faces an imperative to innovate, so too do those who believe in social protection.

      "bodyText": "Concerns that 125,000 former Northern Rock borrowers might be adversely affected by the sale of their loans to a US private equity group have prompted an influential parliamentarian to seek assurances from the Treasury. Andrew Tyrie, a Conservative MP and the chair of the Commons Treasury select committee, has written a letter in relation to George Osborne\u2019s announcement of the \u00a313bn sale of mortgages and unsecured loans to Cerberus, the largest ever financial asset sale by a European government. The US private equity firm indicated that it intended to keep the management of the loans within the mortgage servicing arm of the government\u2019sUK Asset Resolution (UKAR), a body set up to manage toxic loans in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash, with no change to their terms and conditions. But a recent feature on moneysavingexpert.com said only there would be \u201cno imminent change\u201d in the terms and conditions of borrowers\u2019 loans.

Clearly, the Bank of England should be gearing up to join the Federal Reserve in a coordinated increase in interest rates. But it isn\u2019t. The increase in employment and the fall in unemployment has not been accompanied by upward pressure on wages. Far from it. The growth in earnings has been weakening at a time when, according to the Bank\u2019s model of the economy, it should have been strengthening. The obvious conclusion is that the UK is still some distance away from full employment, even though the unemployment rate has dropped from 6% to 5.2% over the past year. This may be the result of underemployment, people who are bringing in a wage but who would prefer to work longer. The total number of hours worked is going up, but the number of hours worked per person is slightly lower now than it was a year ago. It is also the result of a big increase in the supply of labour, much of it coming from outside the UK. Between July and September 2014 and July to September 2015 the number of UK nationals working grew by 122,000 while the number of non-UK nationals rose by 326,000. That\u2019s good news for employers, who can fill vacancies with well-educated workers at modest cost. Despite the talk of a shortage of skilled workers, there is no evidence in the official data that firms are having to pay much more than the going rate of 2% to obtain them. Indeed, the monthly snapshot of the economy provided by the Bank of England\u2019s network of regional agents shows the low level of inflation is acting as a drag on the level of settlements. Inflation has been hovering around zero during 2015, so pay awards of 2% represent a small increase in living standards. What does this all mean? In technical terms, it means there has been a flattening of the short-run Phillips curve, the relationship between wage growth and unemployment. With workers cheap and easy to obtain, unemployment can come continue to come down without pay inflation picking up. In non-technical terms, it means that workers will struggle to get wage increases of much more than 2% until the labour market has tightened further. And, as consumer price inflation starts to edge up in the early months of 2016 and earnings hold steady, that will erode real pay growth. For the millions of people employed in low-skill jobs who have little prospect of getting a decent pay increase, Britain is a treadmill economy. There is no pressure on the Bank to raise rates, which is why the pound fell after the release of the jobs figures.",

      "bodyText": "Domino\u2019s Pizza Group is hoping to take a bigger slice of the German market by setting up a new joint venture with an Australian partner. The group had been attempting to set up a chain in Germany on its own but has now changed tack. It has agreed a joint venture with Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprise (DPE), split one third-two thirds, and will transfer the master franchise rights for the country in return for a payment of \u00a318.2m. At the same time the joint venture has agreed to pay up to \u20ac79m (\u00a357.6m) for Joey\u2019s Pizza, in a deal which will make it the largest delivery service in Germany with around 227 stores, 15 from Domino\u2019s and 212 from Joey\u2019s. Five Domino\u2019s stores will be closed at a cost of \u00a37.3m. Domino\u2019s made an underlying loss of \u00a37.3m from its German operations in 2014, but this improved to a loss of \u00a31.8m for the six months to June this year. It expects full year losses of around \u00a33.5m. The company said it remained comfortable with market forecasts for its 2015 results. Chief executive David Wild said: This is a transformational deal for our German operations....our strategic stake in the joint venture positions [Domino\u2019s] to capitalise on the significant future growth potential of this profitable and scaleable business. Following the announcement, made after the UK market closed on Tuesday, Domino\u2019s shares have climbed 18.5p or nearly 2% to 987.5p. Analyst Nigel Parson at Canaccord Genuity said: We see Domino\u2019s strategic joint-venture with Australian-based Domino\u2019s Pizza Enterprises to buy Joey\u2019s Pizza as an admission that Plan A (build a UK-style operation in Germany from scratch) has failed. But sometimes it is better to move on and Plan JV is worthy of consideration. The acquisition of Joey\u2019s Pizza, Germany\u2019s largest pizza delivery operation, allows Domino\u2019s to catapult itself into No1 slot in a fragmented market with a platform to grow but the decision to do this in partnership rather than alone will puzzle the market. Financing is not an issue, rather the UK operation does not have the expertise to deliver, given the track record in Germany, and this is where the DPE has seen its opportunity to grab a slice of the action and form a European bridgehead. The deal spreads the financial and operational risk and DPG has put and call options to protect its position. Peel Hunt\u2019s Nick Batram said the deal looked \u201ca neat solution to the problem child that was Germany.\u201d He added: Not only has a major management distraction been removed but the group has given itself a much better chance of creating some value out of Germany. The deal doesn\u2019t make a material difference to fair value in the short term, but we do view it positively and retain our add. At Numis Douglas Jack raised his profit forecasts, saying: In our view, this transaction makes strategic sense, creating the leading pizza delivery business in Germany. It can leverage pan-European buying power, utilise DPE\u2019s regional infrastructure expertise, and remove a potential distraction for the UK management team. Our forecast upgrade also reflects the opening of 55 stores in the UK in 2015, ahead of previous guidance (and forecasts) of 50 stores Germany\u2019s expected losses of \u00a33.5m in 2015 will become discontinued, resulting in our pretax profit upgrade to \u00a371.5m from \u00a368.0m. Although Joey\u2019s is expected to generate \u00a35.1m of underlying EBITDA in 2015, we forecast no joint venture profits or losses (versus previous forecast of a \u00a33.4m loss) in 2016 due to the cost of integration and converting stores into the Domino\u2019s brand. In 2017, we forecast a \u00a31.5m joint venture profit (versus previous forecast of a \u00a33.3m loss) as the business starts to expand aggressively.",

      "bodyText": "Pepper pistol The Guardian Angel II is advertised for sale on Amazon.co.uk as a \u201chandy animal deterrent model gun\u201d, priced at \u00a336.73, dispatched and sold by Amazon itself. But when the product arrives, the instructions and diagrams show how to aim the pistol at the face of human target. The gun is blue with a red trigger and has two cylinders filled with high-strength pepper solution, each propelling the liquid at 112mph. Raphael Fleischhauer, the engineer who co-founded Piexon, the Swiss company which manufactures the gun, in 1999, has likened being hit to \u201cgetting slashed in the face\u201d. He explains the liquid hits the target as a sticky solution, hard to remove. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strong pain. You can\u2019t see for 30 minutes. It stops you completely.\u201d When using the Guardian Angel II, the instruction pamphlet advises not pausing after discharging the first cylinder at a potential threat. It recommends releasing a quick second shot. Fleischhauer has been selling other models, similar to the Guardian Angel II, to police and security customers as alternatives to Tasers \u2013 police in Germany, Japan and Switzerland have all bought Piexon pepper pistols. Neither Fleischhauer nor Piexon were responsible for selling or dispatching pistols advertised on Amazon.co.uk. Ordering options for pepper pistol shoppers include gift-wrapping and next-day delivery to UK addresses. There is no need for a firearms licence \u2013 customers are told they can \u201cacquire and maintain [the Guardian Angel II] without authorisation\u201d. The stock is despatched from Amazon\u2019s warehouse near Milton Keynes. In August, Amazon.co.uk was showing nine guns in stock, which had dropped to just one in October. After that date stock levels appear to have been replenished, although the item was removed from sale when the Guardian started making enquiries. There are no customer reviews for the Guardian Angel II, but there are postings from satisfied shoppers who bought the accompanying holster. \u201cI have only had it come loose one time, and that was in the playground, horsing around with my daugher,\u201d says one. \u201cFast shipping, nice product,\u201d writes another. A third says: \u201cI just have to have enough faith this will be effective against dogs, lions, wolves or whatever else the government sees fit to reintroduce to wreak havoc on human life \u2026\u201d Amazon declined to comment on its illegal sale of a weapon banned under the Firearms Act 1968. Gotcha cap The \u201cGotcha\u201d cap is listed on Amazon.co.uk, priced \u00a329.45, as a \u201clow-profile, less-lethal self-defense tool\u201d. Nowhere on the site is it described as a weapon, though online shoppers are told it will \u201cinsure that you will never be caught empty handed\u201d. The cap contains a concealed stabbing and slicing device that can be quickly detached from the peak and be held in a clenched fist like a knuckleduster. Several YouTube demonstration videos show how the Gotcha device functions as an effective weapon. The cap arrives with a warning on a large tag marked \u201cGotcha Cap: Walk Tall!\u201d Here the purpose of the tool is clear: \u201cProduct has functional sharp points. Impact or use may result in SEVERE INJURY or DEATH \u2026 [It] should be treated as a weapon.\u201d The stabbing device, made of a reinforced polymer composite, was jointly designed by Yaron Hanover, an Israeli martial arts expert, and manufacturers FAB-Defense, a firm that claims to make \u201ctactical equipment\u201d for the Israel military and police and to work closely with Israel Special Forces and SWAT teams. Neither Hanover nor FAB-Defense were involved in selling to customers in the UK. The Gotcha cap was sold on Amazon.co.uk by ZFI Inc, a US firm founded by former Israeli army officers which markets \u201cdefence accessories\u201d made by several Israeli manufacturers. Neither Hanover nor FAB-Defense had any involvement. The Gotcha design echoes a concealed weapon attributed in British criminal folklore to a 19th-century Birmingham gang said to have stitched razor blades into the peaks of their cloth caps. The gang, known as the Peaky Blinders, were the inspiration behind the BBC2 drama of the same name. In demonstration videos on his YouTube channel, Yaron Hanover shows how the hidden device can be used in stabbing, slashing or punching manoeuvres. At the end of his introductory clip he stabs the weapon in the air toward the camera and growls \u201cGotcha!\u201d The Guardian asked ZFI about its sale of a weapon illegal in the UK and was told: \u201cThe product you purchased is not considered illegal in \u2026 Israel. [It] is made from non-sharp plastic that cannot injure or kill. It is for intimidation only.\u201d ZFI added it did not believe the Gotcha cap violated Amazon\u2019s UK seller regulations, noting there were no restrictions on its export from Israel. Stun gun torch It looks like a regular torch and is advertised on Amazon.co.uk as a \u201cself-defence flashlight\u201d, but flick a switch and the Guard Dog Security Diablo transforms into a powerful stun gun. The words \u201cstun gun\u201d, perhaps deliberately, are not spelt out. \u201cProtect yourself with this 1m volt \u2018light\u2019 with added voltage to defend yourself against any attacker\u201d, reads the product description. One prospective buyer has posted a question on the Amazon.co.uk page advertising the stun gun: \u201cIs this legal in the UK?\u201d In response, someone called Dan J, said: \u201cI WOULD SAY NOT. It is classed as a firearm and you can get 8 years for carrying.\u201d Surprisingly, when the parcel arrives it contains a different make and model to the one advertised. The seller has instead sent a Zap Light stun gun. Like the Diablo, it can operate as a torch but, when switched to stun mode, claims to send one million volts sparking between six metal prongs protruding around the torch bulb. The weapon was sold on Amazon.co.uk by a small seller business based in St Charles, Missouri, which also sells dog grooming items and kitchen accessories. Its bestseller in the UK is a \u201cSophie the Giraffe\u201d baby toy and teether. At \u00a399.95, the Zap Light was sold at a big mark-up to prices available in America, where it can be bought for just $36. At that profit margin the seller was happy to priority ship to the UK at no extra cost. The stun gun advertised on Amazon.co.uk gets a 4.4 star rating after 15 customer reviews. It is an \u201cawesome product\u201d, \u201cexcellent quality\u201d, and \u201cworth every penny\u201d, say three satisfied customers. One reviewer does warn, however, it \u201ccomes with a HUGE responsibility so THINK before discharging top voltage as effects could last you ALL your life!!\u201d",

    "webTitle": "UK job data: pay growth slows to 2%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wage growth across the economy has slowed to 2% despite continued strength in job creation, underlining the financial challenges facing Britain\u2019s workers in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that average wages grew at an annual rate of 2% in the three months to October. That marked a significant weakening from the 2.4% growth seen in the previous three-monthly period. Sterling fell after the news, which suggests wage inflation has weakened, undermining the case for an imminent rate rise from the Bank of England. Once bonuses were included, pay growth in the three months to October was still just 2.4%, down from 3% over July to September, the ONS said. With inflation running at just 0.1%, living standards are still rising, on average. But anaemic pay growth undermines hopes that household balance sheets will continue to improve after the long post-recession squeeze that saw pay flat or falling for several years. Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \u201cWith living standards still not fully recovered, many families will be worse off this Christmas than they were before the recession. For the recovery to deliver for everyone, we need stronger growth in pay and productivity in 2016.\u201d Pay has remained weak, despite the otherwise strong performance of the labour market. Unemployment fell by 110,000 over the latest three-month period, the ONS said, taking the unemployment rate to 5.2%, the lowest level since early 2006. The share of the working-age population in employment hit a fresh record high. \u201cThe employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 73.9%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971,\u201d the ONS said. George Osborne, the chancellor, stressed that his \u201cnational living wage\u201d, which will increase the minimum wage by 50p an hour for over-25s from April, would help to underpin pay. \u201cOur plan for a more prosperous future is delivering for working people with pay packets growing, and the new national living wage will deliver a further boost next year,\u201d he said. Separate evidence of soggy pay growth came in the Bank\u2019s latest report from its regional agents, also published on Wednesday, which suggested that consistently low inflation may be weighing on wages. \u201cAn increasing number of contacts reported that low inflation had started to hold back wage growth,\u201d it said. Inflation has been close to zero throughout 2015, and the Bank\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee is not expected to increase borrowing costs from their record low of 0.5% until late 2016. John Philpott, of the Jobs Economist consultancy, said this pattern of rapid jobs growth but weak wage inflation was reminiscent of earlier stages of the recovery. \u201cThere is a a palpable sense of \u2018payja vu\u2019 in the labour market, a reminder of the initial phase of the economic recovery characterised by a jobs boom alongside weak productivity and pay growth,\u201d he said. Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, had signalled that he expected to be considering raising interest rates around the turn of this year. But he used an interview with the Financial Times this week to say the timetable is likely to slip because costs \u2013 including wages \u2013 have increased more slowly than anticipated. The details of the ONS data also revealed the shifting composition of Britain\u2019s workforce over the longer term, with just 17.1% of workers employed in the public sector \u2013 the lowest proportion since records began in 1971. The ONS also points out that the presence of non-UK nationals in the workforce has increased significantly since 1997, from 986,000 to 3.22 million \u2013 a shift from 3.7% of the workforce to 10.3%.

But the company, which has restructured with the sale of various assets including the Financial Times, is heading the FTSE 100 risers, up 37.5p at 744.5p, following a couple of positive broker notes, one of which even suggests the company may be better off considering going private. Exane BNP Paribas has upgraded from neutral to outperform, saying the risks of further earnings pressure in 2016 are real but the weak share price seems to have discounted the worst. It said it hoped new management would refocus the company and look at acquisitions and share buybacks. Meanwhile Bernstein, after a conference call with Pearson chief executive John Fallon, issued an outperform rating and said it expected further restructuring charges in 2016, with IT and general and administrative costs likely to be cut. Analyst Claudio Aspesi said: Longer term, Fallon described a company which is more focused geographically and in product/service range. He also underlined the need to keep focus in the near term on improving current performance, rather than pursuing new acquisitions. We would like management to also consider more radical options, including a major downsizing of the business and tough decisions on capital allocation (including a possible buyback) and even taking Pearson private.Some of the options we would hope are on the table include focusing the company down substantially (possibly to just two or three countries \u2013 the US, the UK and perhaps one or two more with the most upside), and exiting businesses which \u2013 irrespective of performance \u2013 are unlikely to benefit for many years from the future adoption of technology. Possible examples include the operation of physical schools, elementary and middle school courseware (the first seven/eight grades of formal schooling) and \u2013 possibly \u2013 testing and assessment.. A substantial shrinkage... would free up resources to progressively buyback stock as the total profits available to pay dividends would have to be cut; alternatively, management may consider whether Pearson would better off by taking the company private as it goes through a radical redesign. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 27.11 points at 6044.89, as investors await the expected US rate rise from the Federal Reserve. But new figures from the UK showed why the Bank of England may not be in a hurry to follow the US example. UK earnings unexpectedly grew at their slowest pace since early 2015 in the three months to October, while the unemployment rate fell to 5.2% from 5.3%. Elsewhere Dixons Carphone is up 11.6p at 488.3p following its figures, while SuperGroup has soared nearly 12% to \u00a316.93 as its half year results beat expectations - the shares were hit earlier this week by a Liberum downgrade. But other retailers have slipped back on concerns about the outlook for Christmas, with prices being slashed to encourage shoppers. Supermarkets are lower on further consideration of Tuesday\u2019s market share figures from Kantar Worldpanel, with Tesco down 2.95p at 146.35p and Sainsbury 3.1p lower at 246.2p. Morrisons is down 1.1p at 146p. Womenswear retailer Bonmarche has slumped nearly 30% to 205.7p after it warned that profits would be lower than previously expected after challenging trading conditions since Black Friday in November, and it believed these would continue for the remainder of the winter season. At the same time it announced the departure of chief executive Beth Butterwick after four years. She will become chief executive of Karen Millen, and her departure would be \u201cunhelpful to investor sentiment\u201d for Bonmarche, according to analysts at Canaccord Genuity. The cautious trading comments from Bonmarche have sent Marks &amp; Spencer 5.5p lower to 457.1p and Next down 70p to \u00a374.35. Miners were also weaker again, with Anglo Amercan down another 0.85p at 270.25p as Deutsche Bank slashed its target price from \u00a310.70 to 300p as part of a sector note. Arm continued to slide, down 14p to \u00a310.38 on concerns about falling demand for Apple\u2019s iPhone which it supplies with its chip designs. But Rolls-Royce has risen 13.5p to 553.5p after Warren East, Arm\u2019s former boss who now runs the aero-engine specialist, announced it was scrapping a layer of senior management as part of its turnaround plan.",

      "bodyText": "The Federal Reserve looks almost certain to raise short-term borrowing rates on Wednesday, ending an extraordinary period of government intervention in the financial markets that started at the height of the recession. Fed chair Janet Yellen will hold a news conference at 2.30pm EST on Wednesday after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) releases its latest statement. She is widely expected to end a policy of fiscal first aid brought in by her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, when the world was in the throes of the worst recession in living memory. Earlier this month, Yellen signaled to Congress\u2019s joint economic committee that the US economy was now strong enough for the Fed to raise rates. The unemployment rate now stands at 5% and economic growth appeared stable, she said. \u201cI currently judge that US economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor market,\u201d she said. \u201cOngoing gains in the labor market, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to 2%.\u201d However, many remain uncertain that the economy is ready for the Fed to raise rates. Richard Trumka, president of the US\u2019s largest union federation, AFL-CIO, urged the Fed to \u201cavoid making a mistake by raising interest rates\u201d. \u201cToo many working people are not feeling the economic recovery because of stagnant wages. In the months to come, the Fed should focus on the policy goal that real wages should rise with productivity. Working people deserve to lead better lives by sharing in the wealth we all create,\u201d he said. If Yellen announces a raise, it will be exactly seven years since the Fed cut rates to the near-zero rates, on 16 December, 2008. The policy was brought in after a mortgage-backed financial bubble exploded and triggered a global financial meltdown. \u201cNear-zero interest rates in place since December 16, 2008, was in essence emergency medicine the Fed put in place when the US economy was on life support,\u201d said PNC chief economist Stuart Hoffman. He said the Fed was now confident about the current state of recovery based on \u201cgrowth in jobs, growth in wages, lower unemployment and increased consumer spending\u201d. Since the recession, in a program started by Bernanke, the Fed has not only kept short-term interest rates near zero but also injected trillions of dollars into the mortgage and Treasury bond markets through a process known as quantitative easing (QE). The aim has been to encourage investment and spending and bring down the jobless rate, now at a rate that is half its 10% peak at the height of the recession. However, long-term unemployment and the jobless rates for minorities and young people remain high, as does the labor force participation rate, the percentage of the population no longer looking for work. The labor force participation rate hit a 38-year low in September and October, with just 62.4% of American civilians older than 16 either working or looking for work. It has since improved marginally, to 62.5% in November. US stock markets once reacted violently to any suggestion that rates might rise. But after the Fed ended QE in October, investors appear to have become resigned to the end of zero rates. On Monday, US stock markets remained largely flat ahead of the historic decision.",

The unemployment rate now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/04/us-economy-december-jobs-report-unemployment-rate\">stands at 5%</a> and economic growth appeared stable, she said.</p> <p>\u201cI currently judge that US economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor market,\u201d she said. \u201cOngoing gains in the labor market, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to 2%.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/video/2015/dec/15/what-is-inflation-economics-explained-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4f46g\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2424103\"            data-video-name=\"What is inflation?

Richard Trumka, president of the US\u2019s largest union federation, AFL-CIO, urged the Fed to \u201cavoid making a mistake by raising interest rates\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cToo many working people are not feeling the economic recovery because of stagnant wages. In the months to come, the Fed should focus on the policy goal that real wages should rise with productivity. Working people deserve to lead better lives by sharing in the wealth we all create,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If Yellen announces a raise, it will be exactly seven years since the Fed cut rates to the near-zero rates, on 16 December, 2008. The policy was brought in after a mortgage-backed financial bubble exploded and triggered a global financial meltdown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/15/federal-reserve-meeting-interest-rates-what-to-know\">Will interest rates rise? Your guide to the Fed's upcoming meeting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNear-zero interest rates in place since December 16, 2008, was in essence emergency medicine the Fed put in place when the US economy was on life support,\u201d said PNC chief economist Stuart Hoffman.<br></p> <p>He said the Fed was now confident about the current state of recovery based on \u201cgrowth in jobs, growth in wages, lower unemployment and increased consumer spending\u201d.</p> <p>Since the recession, in a program started by Bernanke, the Fed has not only kept short-term interest rates near zero but also injected trillions of dollars into the mortgage and Treasury bond markets through a process known as quantitative easing (QE).</p> <p>The aim has been to encourage investment and spending and bring down the jobless rate, now at a rate that is half its 10% peak at the height of the recession. However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/nov/07/long-term-unemployed-support-groups-congress\">long-term unemployment</a> and the jobless rates for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/mar/06/us-economy-booms-youth-unemployment\">minorities and young people</a> remain high, as does the labor force participation rate, the percentage of the population no longer looking for work.</p> <p>The labor force participation rate hit a 38-year low in September and October, with just 62.4% of American civilians older than 16 either working or looking for work. It has since improved marginally, to 62.5% in November.</p> <p>US stock markets once reacted violently to any suggestion that rates might rise. But after the Fed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/09/fed-qe-stimulus-program-october\">ended QE in October</a>, investors appear to have become resigned to the end of zero rates. On Monday, US stock markets remained largely flat ahead of the historic decision.</p>",

With fewer than 10 days to Christmas, discounts are averaging 41.8%, according to analysts at consultants Deloitte, and will rise to 45% by the weekend. Jason Gordon, the consumer business partner at Deloitte, said: \u201cCompared to 2014, there is already a noticeable increase in both the volume and value of discounts in the run-up to Christmas this year. Whilst this is good news for consumers looking to grab a bargain, it is a clear sign that retailers are being faced with what is now an annual uphill battle.\u201d Hopes of a Black Friday rush on the high street were dashed as bad weather, security fears and a lack of enthusiasm for early morning pre-work shopping ensured most bargain hunters bought online. That was bad news for fashion chains hoping to clear rails of knitwear and coats that have been stacking up during the mild weather. The timing of Christmas this year is adding an extra edge to the annual game of chicken between retailers and shoppers hoping to get a deal on their gifts. The number of shoppers visiting non-food stores fell 2.6% last week compared with the same week in 2014, according to data from analysis firm Ipsos Retail Performance (IRP). Dr Tim Denison, the director of retail intelligence at IRP, said: \u201cWith less than a fortnight to go until Christmas, it is beginning to look as if store footfall will be lower than last year. We had expected to see more people shopping early this year, taking advantage of extended promotions after Black Friday, but this has yet to materialise. \u201cTime will tell whether the slack has been taken up by online and mobile, or whether shopping per se is more subdued this year than last. \u201cUnless there is a substantial last-minute rush to the shops, we now project a drop of 0.9% on 2014.\u201d Gordon said most retailers were likely to launch their final festive discounts this weekend because Christmas Day falls on a Friday and they will be keen to grab shoppers\u2019 attention while they are off work. Deloitte is also predicting that limited Sunday trading hours on the Boxing Day weekend may lead retailers to offer slightly deeper discounts than usual immediately after Christmas \u2013 of an average 53%.",
