      "standfirst": "Chief executive steps down after two decades with mining giant as value of company assets lost rises to $14bn", 
      "body": "<p>Tom Albanese, ousted from Rio Tinto on Thursday after a series of disastrous acquisitions, pocketed almost \u00a322m in cash and share options during his stint leading the mining company, which ended abruptly in the wake of a further $14bn (\u00a38.8bn) writedown.</p> <p>The company said Albanese, who will not receive his contractual entitlement of an \u00a38m payoff when he leaves the company in July, will be immediately replaced by Sam Walsh, the 63-year-old head of its iron ore division which is Rio's largest and most profitable business. Doug Ritchie, who led Rio's acquisition of its Mozambique coal business, also stepped down by \"mutual agreement\".</p> <p>The changes came after the company admitted that the value of its aluminium assets had slumped once again \u2013 this time by up to $11bn following an $8.9bn writedown last year. The total rose to $14bn after the company added that its coal assets in Mozambique, which it paid $4bn for in 2011, were now worth just $1bn. It is also expecting smaller writedowns in other businesses totalling around $500m.</p> <p>Rio's chairman Jan du Plessis said: \"The Rio Tinto board fully acknowledges that a writedown of this scale in relation to the relatively recent Mozambique acquisition is unacceptable. We are also deeply disappointed to have to take a further substantial writedown in our aluminium businesses, albeit in an industry that continues to experience significant adverse changes globally.\"</p> <p>The company said a \"further deterioration in aluminium market conditions \u2026 together with strong currencies in certain regions and high energy and raw material costs\" had caused the latest revaluation of its aluminium operations, while in Mozambique it misjudged the ease with which it would gain approval to transport coal by barge on the Zambezi river.</p> <p>Rio paid $38bn in cash to buy Canada-based aluminium group Alcan in June 2007, shortly before the worst of the global financial crisis hit in 2008 and shortly after Albanese became chief executive. The deal, which left Rio with large debts, led to a $15.2bn rights issue, while the first writedown also prompted Albanese to forgo his 2011 bonus.</p> <p>One major Rio shareholder, who pressed Albanese to abort the Alcan deal, said: \"This is a big writedown. For that to come on the back of the first and wipe out such a large chunk of value is shocking. Hopefully this will be a reminder to the mining industry not to get carried away when the going is good with regards to takeovers and capital expenditure.

      "bodyText": "Tom Albanese, ousted from Rio Tinto on Thursday after a series of disastrous acquisitions, pocketed almost \u00a322m in cash and share options during his stint leading the mining company, which ended abruptly in the wake of a further $14bn (\u00a38.8bn) writedown. The company said Albanese, who will not receive his contractual entitlement of an \u00a38m payoff when he leaves the company in July, will be immediately replaced by Sam Walsh, the 63-year-old head of its iron ore division which is Rio's largest and most profitable business. Doug Ritchie, who led Rio's acquisition of its Mozambique coal business, also stepped down by \"mutual agreement\". The changes came after the company admitted that the value of its aluminium assets had slumped once again \u2013 this time by up to $11bn following an $8.9bn writedown last year. The total rose to $14bn after the company added that its coal assets in Mozambique, which it paid $4bn for in 2011, were now worth just $1bn. It is also expecting smaller writedowns in other businesses totalling around $500m. Rio's chairman Jan du Plessis said: \"The Rio Tinto board fully acknowledges that a writedown of this scale in relation to the relatively recent Mozambique acquisition is unacceptable. We are also deeply disappointed to have to take a further substantial writedown in our aluminium businesses, albeit in an industry that continues to experience significant adverse changes globally.\" The company said a \"further deterioration in aluminium market conditions \u2026 together with strong currencies in certain regions and high energy and raw material costs\" had caused the latest revaluation of its aluminium operations, while in Mozambique it misjudged the ease with which it would gain approval to transport coal by barge on the Zambezi river. Rio paid $38bn in cash to buy Canada-based aluminium group Alcan in June 2007, shortly before the worst of the global financial crisis hit in 2008 and shortly after Albanese became chief executive. The deal, which left Rio with large debts, led to a $15.2bn rights issue, while the first writedown also prompted Albanese to forgo his 2011 bonus. One major Rio shareholder, who pressed Albanese to abort the Alcan deal, said: \"This is a big writedown. For that to come on the back of the first and wipe out such a large chunk of value is shocking. Hopefully this will be a reminder to the mining industry not to get carried away when the going is good with regards to takeovers and capital expenditure. The industry is littered with examples of deals being done at the top of the market when chief executives' blood is flowing.\" While Du Plessis paid tribute to the decades-long service of both Albanese and Ritchie, he was keen to point out that the pair would be receiving \"no lump sum payment, no annual short-term performance bonus for 2012 or 2013 [and] no long-term share award for 2013\". He added: \"Quite frankly the world has changed and I believe very strongly that large corporations are going to have to be more sensitive about societal expectations.\" Albanese and Ritchie will both receive base pay, benefits and pension contributions until they leave in the summer. In total Albanese had already earned almost \u00a311m in salary since being promoted to chief executive in May 2007, while his unexercised share options from the 2003-09 period are his to keep \u2013 and are also worth almost \u00a311m. Furthermore, he leaves with a pension that, at the end of 2011, was calculated to pay out a yearly sum of \u00a3476,000, which would cost around \u00a38.5m to buy in the open market. Shares in Rio lost 18.5p to \u00a334.40 although market watchers said that most investors had already written-down Rio's assets in their own calculations. Nic Stanojevic, an analyst at stockbrokers Brewin Dolphin, said: \"We think the more important driver for the shares has been the iron ore price which was down 5% overnight.\" What is a writedown? A writedown, or impairment charge, is an accounting term that means a company no longer believes that the value of certain assets on its balance sheet can be justified. As a result, it will take a hit to its annual profits \u2013 though this may not be accompanied by much of a change in the company's cashflows. Companies often invite investors not to dwell on these \"non-cash\", one-off charges, and to focus on \"underlying\" profit performance. Writedowns are designed to draw a line under discrete issues facing a business, allowing it to move on. However, they are not always final, and contain a good deal of guesswork. The company may later be forced to make further writedowns; the original writedown can also turn out to have been overly pessimistic. On one level, writedowns are an accounting technicality. However, they are a clear indication that a company has made poor investment decisions. The CEO who failed to avert a crisis Tom Albanese has two degrees in mineral economics from the University of Alaska and is a huge Sudoku fan. Yet he never quite mastered the puzzle of handling mining investors during almost six years running Rio Tinto. Albanese was promoted to chief executive just before the Rio's acquisition of Alcan in 2007 - having joined Rio after it acquired his previous employer, NERCO, in 1993. But while he was not entirely to blame for what turned out to be a total disaster, shareholders recall how their protests to the new boss at the time were waved away.

Homebuilders are building new homes at a rate that has surprised even economists. \"Housing starts are off the charts,\" noted Patrick Newport, US economist for IHS Global Insight. US housing starts, which measure new construction, boomed in December with ground broken on 954,000 new homes. That's the highest rate in four years. Economists had expected that only 890,000 new homes would be started.</p> <p>There are several reasons for the jump. Jim O'Sullivan, chief US economist for High-Frequency Economics, attributed it to better weather. Newport, at IHS, suggested that rebuilding in the wake of hurricane Sandy could have boosted the numbers. </p> <p>But the trend isn't that of a single month. A housing recovery has been under way since last year. Another measure, home-building permits, hit its highest point since July 2008. Homebuilders have been seeing a lot of financial encouragement for their efforts, with their stocks hitting new highs all throughout last year, even fueling fears by some commentators that there could be a bubble in housing stocks. </p> <p>Banks are also seeing the financial benefits. Bank of America signed 42% more mortgages in 2012. JP Morgan, which announced its earnings this week, saw its mortgage banking unit move to an income of $418m, from a $269m loss a year ago. By its own account, the bank has been doing booming business: JP Morgan reported new home loans of $51.2bn, up one third; the bank said it originated 920,000 mortgages in the past three months. </p> <p>In short, there's lots of money in housing right now \u2013 unless, that is, you're a homeowner or a would-be homeowner, in which case you're probably not seeing your financial life get any easier. Mortgage rates are still at record lows \u2013 but good luck getting that loan. </p> <p>First, mortgage loans are likely to drop off this year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The MBA predicts that 2012 data will show that there were $1.7tn of new mortgages in 2012, but only $1.3tn in 2013 \u2013 a drop of one quarter. <br> Add to that the fact that almost all the activity in mortgage loans last year \u2013 more than three-quarters of it \u2013 was in refinancings. So if you're a first-time homeowner, or want to be, it is likely no easier for you to get a loan as it was two or three years ago. </p> <p>In addition, refinancing is not a friendly business. Homeowner applications for refinancings \u2013 looking to take advantage of low interest rates \u2013 fell slightly during the end of 2012 but have been on the uptick so far this month; in fact, they are up 15% compared to last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. </p> <p>But good luck getting an actual loan, even for a refinancing: banks are responding to applications for refinancing very slowly. Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicted that refinancing applications would be 8% slower in January, continuing a several-month trend. </p> <p>On the one hand, you might think that slowing mortgage applications means that banks are being more careful, or choosing only the strongest borrowers. That is probably not the case. A joint report from Equifax and Moody's last year found that by February 2012, banks made one-third of consumer finance loans to borrowers that would be considered \"high-risk\". The trend holds for automotive loans too; Experian Automotive found that, between August and October of 2012, subprime buyers were responsible for 42% of all car loans. </p> <p>It could also be simply that banks are overwhelmed by volume; that is likely true, in some small way, because applications are up \u2013 but applications have not risen so far, so fast, that the volume should be impossible to handle. </p> <p>Another way in which homeowners are watching the mortgage money pass right by them is the foreclosure crisis, which is still ongoing, although it seems to have been forgotten in the improving economy except when some bank settles a lawsuit. At the peak of the housing crisis in 2009, there were 2.9m foreclosures; that number has fallen to 1.84m, according to RealtyTrac, with 1.5m homes still in some stage of foreclosure. Yes, that's down from 4.3m in 2009, but that's still a lot of people fighting it out to keep their homes. </p> <p>RealtyTrac believes 2013 will bring more foreclosures as all the ones that have been delayed come to fruition this year. There are still 25 states that saw an increase in foreclosures, with Florida leading the pack.</p> <p>The temptation is to believe that homeowners that have been foreclosed upon caused their own troubles \u2013 but that is not entirely the case, if you look more closely at the wave of news showing that banks and mortgage firms committed foreclosure abuses and made it harder for consumers to find mortgage relief or negotiate payments. </p> <p>There's really no evidence that those old abuses are entirely gone, and multiple stories have shown that banks are not necessarily eager to help people escape foreclosure. The New York Times had a chilling story in December that showed that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/business/widows-pushed-into-foreclosure-by-mortgage-fine-print.html\">widows were being thwarted from solving their mortgage-payment problems</a> because many banks don't recognize them as holders of mortgages that were signed by their late husbands. </p> <p>The problem that ruled during the financial crisis is still ruling the mortgage market: banks will negotiate the terms of debt with each other, but they don't extend the same consideration to consumers. Where one bank can convince another to renegotiate a difficult debt payment, whatever loan documents a consumer signs is apparently set in stone. </p> <p>Against this backdrop, this asymmetry between the benefits of banks and homebuilders and the challenges faced by homeowners, the housing crisis will really never end, no matter how good the numbers look. The housing crisis was not a crisis of numbers; it was a crisis of ethics. A housing recovery, similarly, has to be a recovery in how well good judgement has returned: a recovery in better lending, better borrowing, and better building. It also has to be a recovery for consumers as well as companies as banks. Otherwise, no matter how good the numbers look, they are just the building blocks for another crisis.</p>",

There's really no evidence that those old abuses are entirely gone, and multiple stories have shown that banks are not necessarily eager to help people escape foreclosure. The New York Times had a chilling story in December that showed that widows were being thwarted from solving their mortgage-payment problems because many banks don't recognize them as holders of mortgages that were signed by their late husbands. The problem that ruled during the financial crisis is still ruling the mortgage market: banks will negotiate the terms of debt with each other, but they don't extend the same consideration to consumers. Where one bank can convince another to renegotiate a difficult debt payment, whatever loan documents a consumer signs is apparently set in stone. Against this backdrop, this asymmetry between the benefits of banks and homebuilders and the challenges faced by homeowners, the housing crisis will really never end, no matter how good the numbers look.

A housing recovery, similarly, has to be a recovery in how well good judgement has returned: a recovery in better lending, better borrowing, and better building. It also has to be a recovery for consumers as well as companies as banks. Otherwise, no matter how good the numbers look, they are just the building blocks for another crisis.",

      "bodyText": "So much for a digital Christmas. A mix of low prices, snazzy stores and up-to-the-minute fashion delivered a 25% rise in sales for Primarkin the three months to 5 January without a single item sold online. While rivals rush to invest in smartphone apps and battalions of delivery vans, John Bason, Primark's finance director, said the company had no plans for an internet store. \"Our focus is clearly on the high street consumer experience. This Christmas was a demonstration to me that the high street is not going to disappear any time soon,\" he said. Low-price food stores such as Aldi and Lidl and discount chains including Poundland, 99p Stores and B&amp;M Bargains are also seeing a sales boom without any help from the internet. They are all opening stores and attracting cash-strapped shoppers by holding down prices. Poundland is estimated to have seen a 20% rise in sales over Christmas, Aldi saw sales growth of more than 30% and Lidl's market share hit a new high. \"These stores are giving hope to the high street. They are a chink of light in a very dim retail world,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consultancy Conlumino. Although some see discount stores as part of the decline of the high street, Saunders said most now look good and keep an area vibrant by attracting shoppers looking for a bargain. \"Landlords can't afford to be snobbish about a tenant that is successful,\" Saunders said. Poundland, for example, could double its number of stores to 1,000 over time and B&amp;M is opening a store a week. As rival fashion chains close stores, Primark plans to open 200,000sq ft of new space this year on top of 1.1m sq ft in 2012, which included a second flagship on London's Oxford Street. New developments will include extensions to its Newcastle and Manchester stores and a new store in Frankfurt, Germany. It is also hoping to open a trial store in France this year. Bason said Primark was spending money on making its high street stores look more exciting and modern, keeping prices low and ensuring it had the right range of clothing. That helped the chain achieve underlying sales growth over the three-month period of 9% once the impact of new store openings was stripped out, according to analysts. The headline 25% number included new store openings. Primark saw underlying sales rise in all its markets including Spain, Portugal and Germany, but the UK was its strongest performer. \"Anyone can see Primark has got a strong proposition out there as people are looking for value for money. I'm sure they will look at online in the future,\" said Freddie George, retail analyst at Seymour Pierce. He said it was trickier for low-price retailers such as Primark to make online sales add up because the cost of delivering goods to shoppers' homes was expensive relative to the price of their products. Saunders agreed that keeping operations simple was a key reason why the likes of Primark, Aldi and Poundland were able to offer low prices. \"That's the trade off for the customer. You might have to go to the high street but you get low prices and part of the experience is have a look and seeing what they have got in store.\" He said most of the discounters had plenty of opportunity for growth because their store chains were relatively small at present but achieving profitable online sales would be a challenge. Andrew Higginson, chairman of Poundland, said the chain would look at selling goods online in future but that was not at the top of its priority list. He said the store's website was still important as a large number of shoppers used it to check out information on products. \"Its about getting coverage on social media for now,\" he said. \"For the industry in general, over the long term, its about multi-channel, people moving seamlessly between shopping online and in physical stores. It all comes back to the customer and how they want to shop and live their lives. You have got to be relevant.\"",

A mix of low prices, snazzy stores and up-to-the-minute fashion delivered a 25% rise in sales for Primarkin the three months to 5 January without a single item sold online.</p> <p>While rivals rush to invest in smartphone apps and battalions of delivery vans, John Bason, Primark's finance director, said the company had no plans for an internet store. \"Our focus is clearly on the high street consumer experience.

Helena Smith writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a speech that was by turns poignant, matter-of-fact and angry, Papaconstantinou not only strenuously denied doctoring the list but said it would have been \u201cidiotic\u201d of him to do so.</p> <p>\u201cI changed absolutely nothing. It would have been absurd and idiotic. I would not have done it in such a way that would incriminate me so obviously,\u201d he told MPs.</p> <p>The former minister, who could be tried before a special court if the 300-seat House votes later today to launch a criminal investigation against him, insisted he had no knowledge of any of his relatives being on the list and so could not, as charged, have removed their names.</p> <p>\u201cIs it possible that I did not see the list? That I did not see the names of my relatives,\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cThe answer: there was no list. There were around 2000 archives. And it was not my business to open 2000 archives. Besides, even if I had wanted to I couldn\u2019t have because I would have needed days [to do so]. What I saw were 20 names with the biggest deposits that my associate brought to me on a piece of paper and which I gave to Mr Kapeleri [the then head of the financial crime squad].

Deleting the names of my three relatives, and only these, is an attempt to incriminate me.\u201d</p> <p>Papaconstiantinou&#xa0;said he had made many enemies during his 20 months in office which coincided with the eruption of Greece's debt crisis in late 2009. Unlike his predecssors, he said, he had taken steps to crack down on tax evasion \u2013 the single biggest loss to the debt-stricken Greek economy including requesting the list from the then French finance minister Christine Lagarde.</p> <p>\"We didn\u2019t play PR games.

      "bodyText": "With a late lift from Wall Street following better than expected housing and jobs claims figures \u2013 and ignoring poor Philadelphia Fed manufacturing numbers \u2013 European markets have ended the day in positive territory. \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished up 28.38 points at 6132.36, up 0.46%. \u2022 Germany's Dax is up 0.58%. \u2022 France's Cac has closed 0.96% higher. \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 1.43% better. \u2022 Spain's Ibex has ended up 0.56%. \u2022 The Athens market has added 0.10%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 70 points or 0.52% higher. And with that, it's time to shut up shop for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we'll be back tomorrow. On specific countries, Lagarde said confidence in Greece had been restored, but it would probably be a year before international lenders could judge whether the country was delivering on its commitments. She said Portugal needed more fiscal consolidation, with the authorities having to decide what was most appropriate. Away from the controversy over the Lagarde list, the managing director of the IMF has called for further monetary easing in Europe. Christine Lagarde is speaking at a new year press conference in Washington, which can be followed here. She said the world had stopped an economic collapse, and in 2013 it needed to make sure there was no relapse. With risks remaining significant she listed three priorites for policymakers to sustain the recovery: implement policies to put uncetainties to rest; finish financial sector reform; and increase focus on the real economy and people. Back in Greece, the former finance minister George Papaconstantinou has robustly denied accusations that he altered the infamous Lagarde list of possible tax evaders in a speech in parliament. Helena Smith writes: In a speech that was by turns poignant, matter-of-fact and angry, Papaconstantinou not only strenuously denied doctoring the list but said it would have been \u201cidiotic\u201d of him to do so. \u201cI changed absolutely nothing. It would have been absurd and idiotic. I would not have done it in such a way that would incriminate me so obviously,\u201d he told MPs. The former minister, who could be tried before a special court if the 300-seat House votes later today to launch a criminal investigation against him, insisted he had no knowledge of any of his relatives being on the list and so could not, as charged, have removed their names. \u201cIs it possible that I did not see the list? That I did not see the names of my relatives,\u201d he asked rhetorically. \u201cThe answer: there was no list. There were around 2000 archives. And it was not my business to open 2000 archives. Besides, even if I had wanted to I couldn\u2019t have because I would have needed days [to do so]. What I saw were 20 names with the biggest deposits that my associate brought to me on a piece of paper and which I gave to Mr Kapeleri [the then head of the financial crime squad]. My relatives were not among those 20 names.\" Helena continues: Papaconstantinou claimed he was given the names after requesting the details of the biggest account holders. \u201cFurthermore I had no reason [to delete the names] given that the money has been shown to be legally acquired and subject to taxation. Deleting the names of my three relatives, and only these, is an attempt to incriminate me.\u201d Papaconstiantinou said he had made many enemies during his 20 months in office which coincided with the eruption of Greece's debt crisis in late 2009. Unlike his predecssors, he said, he had taken steps to crack down on tax evasion \u2013 the single biggest loss to the debt-stricken Greek economy including requesting the list from the then French finance minister Christine Lagarde. \"We didn\u2019t play PR games. We made real changes \u2026 perhaps because of all [those changes] I am in the position I am in today, because the changes irritated a lot of people.\" The crucial vote is expected later tonight. Analysts said despite his robust defense, they did not think it would be enough for Papaconstantinou to escape criminal investigation. Former prime ministers George Papandreou and Lucas Papademos will also be the focus of the vote along with socialist leader Evangelos Venizelos who succeeded Papacpnstantinou as finance minister. Few believe, however, that any will be indicted. More on the succession to Jean-Claude Juncker as head of the Eurogroup. Juncker is meeting the Dutch finance minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, on Friday to prepare for the next Eurogroup meeting, to be held on Monday. But the Dutchman is favourite to take over from Juncker and he might make good use of tomorrow's meeting: There are some rumours going round that Ireland and Portugal could ask the European Central Bank to intervene in the debt markets today, via the outright monetary transactions programme. Announced in August last year, the OMT involves the central bank buying up bonds of countries already in a bailout programme to keep their borrowing costs down. It would make sense for countries to ask for the ECB's help if they were about to issue new debt, as new debt will likely be priced according to yields in the secondary market. In other words, the ECB buys Portuguese bonds in the secondary market pushing prices up and yields down. Portugal issues a new bond, priced according to secondary market rates, meaning yields are lower thanks to the ECB, so its borrowing costs come down. And with that, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. Open Europe is running an interesting blogpost asking: \"Do Ed Miliband and David Cameron actually agree on Europe?\" Miliband appeared on Radio 4's Today programme this morning, calling for a \"more flexible Europe\". Why do I say that? Because we will have some countries in the euro, Britain\u2019s not going to be joining the euro, won\u2019t be joining the euro if I\u2019m prime minister, and therefore by the nature of it, we\u2019re going to have some countries that are in the euro and some countries that are out. That makes, what I would call, a more flexible European Union. Open Europe notes that this is almost exactly what Cameron says. The pair also agree on the need for a referendum if there is a transfer of powers to the EU, and the need to repatriate powers. In fact, Open Europe says, the only difference in policy that Miliband can point to is his view on the European arrest warrant. Miliband thinks it is good, Cameron does not. It writes: Even here, from the government's point of view, the real question is reform of the EAW and the jurisdiction of the [European court of justice] post 2014, and whether to opt back into this particular measure. It concludes: This a country far more united on the need for anew relationship within the EU than the politicians would dare to admit. To the markets, which were cheered by the upbeat data out of the US (see 1.55pm). Futures are suggesting a 68-point rise on the Dow Jones when it opens at 2.30pm. UK FTSE 100: up 0.41%, or 25 points, at 6129 points Germany DAX: up 0.6% France CAC 40: up 1.08% Spain IBEX: up 0.89% Italy FTSE MIB: up 1.28% There's some cheery news out of the US, where jobless claims dropped last week and housebuilding rose in December. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a five-year low, to 335,000, compared with expectations of 369,000. Separately, housing starts climbed 12.1% in December to a 954,000 annual rate, the best year for the industry since 2008. Frank Lesh, futures analyst and broker at Futurepath Trading, said: The housing data was great and so were these jobless claims. Both of them said 'buy more equities'. We are going to keep going up until some of these problems surface and it stops us, if they do. At this point you just don't know how [negotiations over the next 'fiscal cliff' are] going to turn out, but do you just sit on the sidelines and wait? No! It's great news and it should take the markets higher. Over to Greece, where Athens metro workers say they will extend today's strike over pay and will not work tomorrow. The union leader Antonis Stamatopoulos told Skai radio: People will need to suffer now, but we will earn their eternal gratitude after this government has been thrown out. And for a quick lunchtime round-up... The Greek finance minister, Yiannis Stournaras, says it is too early to declare victory, after the IMF waved through its next tranche of aid. (9.37am) Portugal, whose bailout programme ends next year, could return to the debt markets in the coming days, according to a Portuguese newspaper. (9.18am) The Italian PM, Mario Monti, has struck an anti-Berlusconi pact with the frontrunner in the forthcoming elections, Pier Luigi Bersani, says La Repubblica. (8.41am) The European Council president, Herman Van Rompuy, calls the end of the crisis, saying the worst is behind us. (10.09am, 11.38am) EU leaders will resume budget talks in February. (11.09am) Sticking with Portugal, the prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, says the country hopes to carry out long-term bond issues this year, as envisaged in the bailout agreement. Speaking in Paris, he said: Our objective this year is to return to the [bond] market. We are seeking to carry out long-term [debt] issues and hope to gain the necessary support from our partners to do that. The Portuguese government has reacted to reports that it could return to the debt markets in February (see 9.18am). Reuters reports: Portugal government says authorised debt agency IGCP to issue public debt and early loans redemption. It says the IGCP can act to take advantage of market opportunities after improvement in sentiment. The country is doing all it can to return to the market as soon as possible. But it says there is no set schedule. Over to Greece again, where our correspondent Helena Smith says the country will be hanging on the words of the former finance minister George Papaconstantinou when he addresses parliament today. She writes: The speech is being eagerly awaited \u2013 with TV stations saying they will break into their programme schedules to air it \u2013 as Papaconstantinou is the central figure in the ever deepening scandal over the \"Lagarde list\", the tally of suspected tax evaders that Papaconstantinou was handed by Christine Lagarde when she was French finance minister in 2010. With the 300-seat House preparing to vote on whether to launch a criminal investigation into Papaconstantinou's alleged mishandling of the list \u2013 he stands accused of not only failing to act on the list but actively deleting the names of three of his relatives on it \u2013 many are keen to hear what he will say. This is the first time the LSE-trained economist will speak publicly on the matter. \"He is in a difficult position but we have seen a lot of things and we have to assume innocence,\" said Nikos Bistis, a lawmaker with the Democratic Left, one of three parties supporting prime minister Antonis Samaras' conservative-led coalition. Lagarde, now head of the IMF, said in an interview with SKAI TV last night that Papaconstantinou had asked her for the list of wealthy Greeks with banks accounts at the Geneva branch of HSBC with a view to investigating whether they had declared the deposits. Many of the account holders are believed to have stashed the deposits abroad in a bid to dodge taxes. Meanwhile, investors are still paying the UK to keep their money. Today's auction of gilts due in 2029 resulted in a yield of -0.37%, compared with -0.025% in August last year. Back to Van Rompuy, the EC president, who has released the text of his speech to the European Economic and Social Committee (in French). He said: 2013 started on a hopeful note. The signs point to the fact that the worst is well and truly behind us... For the first time in months, financial stability is back. But he warned that it would still take time for that to have any real impact on the economy. While this rediscovered stability is vital for a recovery, the reality is that we need time for it to have any concrete effect on the economy and employment. There is always a delay between the return of stability and a return to growth. There is a further delay on top of that, between the return to growth and an improvement in the employment situation. He welcomed the banking union and efforts to explore greater economic and budgetary union. But he said: We must never forget the social dimension of our economic policies. Stability is a means, but not an end in itself. Our entire approach must be social in its nature. No doubt there is a more upbeat haiku in the offing. Any suggestions? For inspiration, here is Van Rompuy's rather gloomy offering in November last year, titled Autumn end November: The night has fallen The bare branches can be seen Even more lonely. European Union leaders will resume battle over the region's long-term budget at a summit in Brussels on 7-8 February, Reuters reports. Last time they met, in November, the leaders failed to come to an agreement over the budget worth nearly \u20ac1,000bn, which covers spending for 2014-2020. One EU official told Reuters: The intention is to pick up the discussions where they have been suspended last time. Germany is warning against Europe printing money to find its way out of the crisis. The Germany finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, says: Inflation is the greatest social injustice. He says the bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, should only provide direct help for banks as a last resort. Looking further afield, Sch\u00e4uble says he is \"quite worried\" about the new Japanese government's policy of flooding market with yet more liquidity. He sounds a cautiously optimistic note on the crisis, however, saying we're not over the hill but we are on the right path. Construction data out of the eurozone would appear to show a brightening picture, though it's still pretty bleak. Construction output dropped by 0.4% in November. Previous estimates suggested output dropped by 1.6% in October, but that has been revised to \"no change\". And the European Central Bank remains downbeat in its monthly health check of the eurozone. It expects economic weakness in the eurozone to continue this year. In particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in financial and non-financial sectors and persistent uncertainty will continue to weigh on economic activity. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. Later in the year, the ECB says, economic activity should gradually recover. In particular, the accommodative monetary policy stance, together with significantly improved financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, should work its way through to the economy, and global demand should strengthen. In order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. But there are still significant risks that things will go worse than planned. Particularly if governments are slow to implement reforms, it writes. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. They are mainly related to slow implementation of structural reforms in the euro area, geopolitical issues and imbalances in major industrialised countries. These factors have the potential to dampen sentiment for longer than currently assumed and delay further the recovery of private investment, employment and consumption. But tensions in the eurozone remain. Someone in Athens took a novel approach to expressing their hatred for the German chancellor with an imaginatively named Wi-Fi network. The worst is well and truly behind us, says Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council (and haiku fan), this morning. Speaking at the European Economic and Social Committee, he says the European Union is at a turning point today. Citizens to be more than ever in the center... We must never lose sight of the social dimension of our economic policies. The results of Spain's bond auctions are coming in and borrowing costs are coming down. The average yield (essentially the interest rate) on the 2041 bond was 5.696% this morning, compared with 5.893% on 13 December. The average yield on the 2018 bond was 3.77%, vs 3.988% on 10 January. The average yield on the 2015 bond was 2.713% vs 3.358% on 13 December. In the secondary market \u2013 where traders buy and sell bonds that have already been issued \u2013 the yield on Spain's 10-year government bond is creeping down towards 5%. Tradeweb currently has it at 5.039%. It is too early to declare victory, says the Greek finance minister, Yiannis Stournaras, after the IMF waved through the stricken country's next aid payment. In an interview with Reuters, Stournaras said the country must resist internal political pressure to slow economic reforms in a year that will dictate whether it avoids bankruptcy. What scares me is the big pressure from society, media and parliamentary deputies from all parties to ease the programme. We must resist... it's too early to declare victory. He ruled out another debt buyback and said there was no discussion of a haircut of Greece's debts to its eurozone partners. He said debt reduction could come in other ways such as cutting interest rates. Under the heading 'Good News', Reuters reports that Greece expects to meet this year's target of making \u20ac2.6bn through privatisation. The country may also need less than the \u20ac50bn set aside for bank recapitalisaitons, as a result of a wave of mergers between banks. And it looks like Portugal might be about to return to the debt markets, sooner than expected. The country \u2013 which has imposed stinging austerity in exchange for a bailout from the troika \u2013 is planning to issue five-year bonds in the coming days, according to Diario Economico. Ant\u00f3nio Costa reports that the government has decided to tap the debt markets before the end of February, following a successful sale of Treasury bills on Wednesday, citing unnamed sources. The final decision will depend on the outcome of a roadshow in the US this week, the Eurogroup's meeting Monday and the 2012 budget execution report next Wednesday. Portugal \u2013 whose bailout expires in 2014 \u2013 was expected to return to markets in September 2013 when it is due to repay some \u20ac5.8bn of debt. This week the Portuguese government published new tax rules that further cut the income of workers and pensioners, prompting fresh protests from a normally mild-mannered population. Over in Italy, there are reports that the prime minister, Mario Monti, and Pier Luigi Bersani, the frontrunner in next month\u2019s elections, have reached an \"anti-Berlusconi deal\" for the campaign and a possible post-election alliance. La Repubblica reports (in Italian) that the pair have identified the former leader Silvio Berlusconi as their opponent and will try to direct their campaign towards a common goal: an alliance between progressives and moderates following the election. France needs wide-ranging structural reforms, says the EU vice-president Olli Rehn. Rehn says France may need to take more steps to curb its deficit. The country's unemployment problem also needs specific attention, he says. France had an unemployment rate of 10.5% in November last year, compared with the UK's 7.8%. Rehn also says France has serious external imbalances, which will raise eyebrows. (Thanks to Bloomberg for the headlines). Spain holds a series of bond auctions today, where it is expecting strong demand and sharply lower yields. The ECB also publishes its monthly report this morning and the IMF chief Christine Lagarde will be talking in Washington later. Swiss producer and import prices for December: 8.15am ECB monthly report: 9am EU's Herman Van Rompuy speaks: 9am Bank of England's Tucker speaks: 9am Eurozone construction output for November: 10am US housing starts for December: 1.30pm US weekly jobless claims: 1.30pm Germany's Angela Merkel attends an election rally: 4pm IMF's Lagarde holds a news conference: 4pm In the debt markets, Spain will sell up to \u20ac4.5bn of bonds due in 2015, 2018 and 2041. The UK is selling \u00a31bn of index-linked gilts due in 2029 and France is selling up to \u20ac8bn of bonds due in 2015, 2017 and 2018. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone crisis. The IMF agreed to pay the next tranche of bailout aid to the Greek government last night, averting a catastrophic default and securing the country's survival in the eurozone. The \u20ac3.24bn instalment had been frozen as the IMF considered Athens' economic reforms. Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, said yesterday that Greece had made progress but urged it to do more to boost productivity. Meanwhile, Sweden has joined the chorus of voices urging David Cameron to keep Britain at the centre of the European Union. Cameron is due to give a speech on Friday, outlining plans to renegotiate the UK membership of Europe and put it to a referendum. Last night the Swedish finance minister, Anders Borg, said he was concerned that the European project was becoming less popular in the UK. We would not like to see the UK sliding away from the European Union. For Europe, for Sweden, for the UK it is a key interest to keep Britain's perspective in the European Union. Like Britain, Sweden belongs to the European Union but has not adopted the euro.",

After production problems that delayed delivery by three years, the aircraft's \"teething problems\" \u2013 after 15 months in service \u2013 have now prompted the FAA to act. Its chief initial focus is the lithium-ion batteries that caught fire. Japanese authorities believe the latest incident could have resulted in a serious accident.</p> <p>In one silver lining, analysts said the Dreamliner's woes and delays could provide a temporary fillip for the airline industry overall, which has had profits hit by an excess of plane capacity.</p>",

Speaking ahead of his company's unveiling of its 2012 results in Toulouse, France, the chief executive, Fabrice Bregier, said it was not his place to \"give Boeing lessons\" and noted that Airbus had suffered similar problems \u2013 alluding to the cracks in the wings of the new Airbus A380s in 2011. The advanced technology behind the 787, a \"plastic plane\" made from lighter, carbon composite materials, garnered enormous orders from airlines eagerly awaiting its fuel savings. Holiday firm Thomson \u2013 scheduled to be the first British airline to operate Dreamliners \u2013 based its advertising on the new planes, which also promise a better experience for passengers and fewer ill-effects from long-haul flights. However, its cutting edge status could backfire if problems erode public confidence. After production problems that delayed delivery by three years, the aircraft's \"teething problems\" \u2013 after 15 months in service \u2013 have now prompted the FAA to act. Its chief initial focus is the lithium-ion batteries that caught fire. Japanese authorities believe the latest incident could have resulted in a serious accident. In one silver lining, analysts said the Dreamliner's woes and delays could provide a temporary fillip for the airline industry overall, which has had profits hit by an excess of plane capacity.",

    "webTitle": "The Albanese years at Rio Tinto: a squandered opportunity", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tom Albanese had been on borrowed time at Rio Tinto for about four years. It was in early 2009 that the chief executive was obliged to confront his horrible mistake in paying $38bn \u2013 in cash, for heaven's sake \u2013 at the top of the commodities cycle in 2007 for Alcan, a major aluminium producer. Was it hubris, an attempt to bulk up to forestall a bid from arch-rival BHP Billiton, or an inherited deal from the former chairman Paul Skinner that prompted a gamble that, even at the time, smacked of staying on the dance floor too long? Whatever it was, the BHP bid arrived anyway \u2013 and then went away in the post-pop commodity world. The damage to Rio's balance sheet remained and Albanese's proposed repair job was humiliating. He wanted to flog minority stakes in some of Rio's operations to Chinalco, a Chinese state-owned firm, thereby creating a political storm in Australia. He was saved from himself only by the subsequent bounce-back in commodity prices, which gave shareholders the confidence to recapitalise Rio themselves via a $15bn rights issue. Calm was restored as the price of iron ore \u2013 the source of most of Rio's profit \u2013 headed skyward again. By early 2011, the company was generating cash at a rate of $64m a day, or $1m every 23 minutes. The balance sheet was once again pristine. All Albanese had to do was avoid shooting himself in the foot with another over-priced acquisition. He failed. In 2011, the never-ending struggle to diversify earnings led to a $4bn offer for Riversdale, a Mozambique coal miner. Today Rio wrote down the value of the asset by an extraordinary $3bn, or 75%. The problem? The company hasn't won the expected permits to transport coal along the Zambezi river and the estimate of recoverable coal has been cut. Basic stuff, in other words. To rub salt into shareholders' wounds, Alcan isn't judged to be worth even its written-down value. Another almighty impairment charge \u2013 $10bn-$11bn \u2013 in aluminium has been unveiled. The total from aluminium is now almost $30bn, with Alcan the major culprit. Albanese's departure by \"mutual consent\" was inevitable. By all accounts, he's terrific at the nuts-and-bolts business of organising the management of operations. But in the past decade's rollercoaster market for miners, success and failure has been dictated by acquisition strategy. The primary task of a chief executive was to avoid buying assets at the wrong time at the wrong price. Albanese has two stinkers on his record \u2013 one at the absolute peak of the market, one when on deal-doing probation \u2013 plus a highly dilutive rights issue. The chairman, Jan du Plessis, is being commendably strict in limiting Albanese's payoff, and that of Doug Ritchie, who was the day-to-day executive on the Mozambique misadventure. But a measure of how great Rio could have been for its shareholders is seen in the value of Albanese's unexercised share options from the 2003-09 period \u2013 ie pre-Alcan \u2013 which he'll obviously keep. Even with the calamities, these are still worth \u00a310.7m. If the mishaps and the emergency cash call hadn't happened, who knows? But miles more. The pricing dynamics in iron ore, where Rio is the world's second-largest producer, are almost heaven-sent. It costs the company about $47 to dig a tonne of the stuff out of the Pilbara desert in Australia and ship it to China, where it can currently be sold to steelmakers for $145. That's why Sam Walsh, the new boss, starts on the front foot. But the verdict on the Albanese years is clear: what a wasted opportunity to make shareholders extremely rich.",
