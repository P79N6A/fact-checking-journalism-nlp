      "bodyText": "Charlotte Hogg, a week ago, could not have been clearer. \u201cI am in compliance with all of our codes of conduct. I know that. I helped to write them,\u201d declared the Bank of England\u2019s new deputy governor to the Treasury select committee. Now comes the excruciating apology. Actually, no, she was not in compliance because she didn\u2019t declare to the Bank when she joined in 2013 that her brother, Quintin, has a senior job in strategy at Barclays, a bank regulated by Threadneedle Street. In fact, the first time she mentioned her brother was in a questionnaire she filled out for the Treasury committee. She takes full responsibility for this regrettable oversight. Astonishing would be better description. At a push, one might say that Hogg comes from such well-connected stock (her grandfather, Lord Hailsham, was lord chancellor and her parents are serving members of the House of Lords) that a sibling at Barclays is easy to overlook. But that doesn\u2019t wash. The codes are designed to cover all potential conflicts of interests, plus perceptions of conflicts. Her brother\u2019s gig clearly met the threshold. Thus Hogg, in her previous role of chief operating officer at the Bank, had been commanding others to follow a code while failing to do so herself. There were at least two occasions when she could have corrected the omission in the records but didn\u2019t. For two and a half hours the Treasury committee chewed over these revelations and only one member came to a firm conclusion. Hogg\u2019s position was \u201cuntenable\u201d and she should resign, said John Mann. Chair Andrew Tyrie said the committee as a whole would only give its view after \u201ca period of reflection.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that reflection goes wider than just Hogg\u2019s foul-up. Her mistake seems to have been honest and there is no suggestion that information passed improperly between her and her brother. Rather, it\u2019s the Bank\u2019s reaction that is alarming. Anthony Habgood and Bradley Fried, chairman and deputy chairman of the governing court of the Bank, gave a hapless performance in front of the MPs. If they were aware that governor Mark Carney gave Hogg a verbal warning on Monday, they didn\u2019t mention the fact. Neither man seemed to have tried to establish what Quintin Hogg\u2019s loosely defined job at Barclays actually involves. And the MPs made mincemeat of the suggestion that Charlotte Hogg\u2019s undeclared potential conflict of interest didn\u2019t matter terribly in her previous operational role. The sense of closing ranks around an \u201cimpeccable\u201d individual whose error was serious but merited only \u201cgrumpiness,\u201d as Fried put it, was unmistakable. Jacob Rees-Mogg, for the MPs, got it right. The court\u2019s investigation lacked rigour. It accepted \u201cbland reassurances and passed them on\u201d, which is not good enough if you\u2019re in the business not only of avoiding conflicts of interest but also the perception. Hogg, almost certainly, will survive the affair, albeit with her authority dented. But the whiff of complacency in the court is harder to overlook. After the financial crisis, the outside world was promised firm 21st-century governance led by commanding outsiders. Tuesday\u2019s show looked old-style cosy. House prices: bring on the slowdown Encouraging news from the housing market: cooler winds are blowing. The rate of growth in prices fell in February to the lowest for three and a half years, according to the Halifax\u2019s index. This development may not delight homeowners looking to sell in a hurry but, for anybody with a wider or longer perspective, a slowdown is exactly what the UK needs. Annual house price inflation a year ago had reached the silly level of 10%, far too fast for an economy growing at about 2%. A correction was overdue and the steady decline to 5.1%, down from 5.7% in January, restores a degree of sanity. A rate of 5% is still too high given that average earnings are currently growing at 2.5%, but most economists think house price inflation should slow to 2% by the end of this year. Bring it on. To see why, look at Halifax\u2019s ratio of house prices to earnings, as reliable a guide as any to affordability, froth and danger. The current level is about six times (pdf), which was last seen in 2007, just before the banking crash and recession. If 10% house price inflation had continued, the UK would have been heading into dangerous waters. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policymakers, already fretting about the rise in unsecured credit card debt, should be relieved. Their working plan this year and next, one assumes, will be to keep interest rates at ultra-low levels and ignore the inflationary effects of the 15% fall in the pound against the dollar. It is a sensible plan to address the Brexit uncertainties, but it is horribly exposed to the risk of a house price bubble fuelled by cheap money. If that risk is receding, the Bank has a freer hand and the Brexit obstacle looks slightly less daunting.",

      "bodyText": "Couriers carrying emergency blood supplies and delivering passports have kicked off two new challenges to the gig economy as MPs debate how to clarify workers\u2019 employment status. Five cyclists, motorcyclists and van drivers carrying emergency blood supplies to hospitals and samples to laboratories on Tuesday launched a claim challenging their self-employed status in the first gig-economy test case to hit the healthcare sector. The couriers, who all work for The Doctors Laboratory, a company which provides pathology services to the NHS, argue that they are employees and not independent contractors. The case is being backed by the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain. \u201cI risked my life every day to get emergency blood to people, but the company won\u2019t even recognise my basic employee rights without a fight,\u201d one claimant, Ronnie De Andrade, said. \u201cI have been working for them for over five years and I don\u2019t see my life progressing like this. I can\u2019t get a mortgage, I have no pay when I go on holiday and I can\u2019t get sick because I won\u2019t get paid.\u201d Also on Tuesday, more than 20 van drivers working for DX, an Aim-listed courier firm which works for Amazon, the US embassy and dozens of other clients, kicked off legal action questioning their self-employed status. The action, which began with an approach to conciliation service Acas, is being taken by law firm Leigh Day on behalf of the GMB union, which previously successfully challenged the self-employed status of Uber drivers. If conciliation is not successful the case will be submitted to an employment tribunal. TDL said it had not received formal notification of any employment tribunal claims brought by any of its couriers. \u201cWe keep the working arrangements of our couriers under constant review to ensure that we comply with the latest standards and legal requirements,\u201d a spokesperson said. The TDL couriers\u2019 claim for employee status, which was filed on Tuesday at the London central employment tribunal, goes a step further than previous gig-economy cases \u2013 against taxi hailing app Uber and courier firm City Sprint \u2013 which both successfully argued drivers were officially \u201cworkers\u201d. Workers, who are employed under a contract in which they must always turn up for work even if they don\u2019t want to, are entitled to employment rights including the national living wage, holiday pay and protection against discrimination, and may also miss out on other benefits including sick pay and maternity leave. Employees have those additional rights guaranteed as well as protection against unfair dismissal, statutory redundancy pay and the right to request flexible working. A self-employed independent contractor receives no entitlement to employment rights, beyond basic health and safety and anti-discrimination framework. Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain, said the TDL case was a \u201cblack and white example of bogus employment status\u201d, as the couriers were required to work regular shifts dictated by the company, had to request time off and were not allowed to reject deliveries they were told to do. They are also not allowed to take outside employment while working for TDL. The DX drivers claim that they are workers as the courier firm determines the routes they drive to deliver parcels and they cannot refuse to deliver parcels on their daily manifest. They are paid at a rate determined by DX, which is not usually negotiable. The DX and TDL cases have emerged as employment experts call on the government to tackle exploitation of the lower-paid by abolishing different categories of worker after a string of scandals concerning the treatment of lower paid workers in the UK. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is also expected to announce a consultation on the taxation of the self-employed in Wednesday\u2019s budget. DX had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Speaking on Tuesday at the first hearing into the future world of work by the Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee, Hannah Reed, a senior policy officer at the Trades Union Congress, said: \u201cThere should be a floor of rights for all working people \u2013 a single worker definition.\u201d Sue Tumblety, founder and managing director of the employment human resources consultancy HR Dept Ltd, added: \u201cI would like the \u2018worker\u2019 category to go.\u201d Moyer-Lee said there was clarity between the different classes of worker but there needed to be better enforcement of the rules. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not in favour of eliminating worker status. I think there are are people who are in between an independent contractor and an employee.\u201d He added that getting rid of worker status might also make it harder for those currently classed as self-employed to win more rights from their employers - because the hurdle of proof was higher.",

    "webTitle": "Hammond gets budget boost as OECD upgrades UK growth forecast", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The west\u2019s leading economic thinktank has raised its outlook for the UK this year, in a boost to Philip Hammond ahead of his budget. But the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said it still expected Britain\u2019s economy to shift down a gear compared with last year as rising inflation hits households. The Paris-based organisation predicts that after expanding 1.8% in 2016, the UK economy will grow 1.6% this year. That is faster than the 1.2% it was predicting in late November. It made no changes to its earlier forecast for growth to slow further in 2018 to just 1% \u2013 which would be the weakest performance since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009. It also highlighted rapid house price growth in the UK and other countries as a potential warning sign of another economic downturn. The thinktank\u2019s upgrade for the UK came ahead of the chancellor\u2019s spring budget on Wednesday, when he is expected to unveil a brighter outlook for the economy and public finances while making the case that he must keep back any extra money to help the UK weather uncertainties from the Brexit process. The OECD did not single out Hammond, but used its interim economic outlook on Tuesday to urge all governments to make the most of any fiscal wriggle room they have to support economic growth and to tackle inequality. It called on policymakers to use a mix of state spending and underlying reforms in areas such as job markets. It also renewed its warning that a new wave of protectionism risks derailing a modest pick-up in global growth expected this year. \u201cGrowth is still too weak and its benefits too narrowly focused to make a real difference to those who have been hit hard by the crisis and who are being left behind,\u201d said the OECD\u2019s secretary general, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda. \u201cNow, more than ever, governments need to take actions that restore people\u2019s confidence while at the same time resisting turning inwards or rolling back many of the advances that have been achieved through greater international cooperation.\u201d The new forecasts envisage the UK economy performing in line with the eurozone economy, where GDP is also expected to expand by 1.6% in 2017. The US economy, helped by an expected rise in spending under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, is forecast to grow 2.4% this year. Following June\u2019s referendum result, the OECD was, like many forecasters, forced to backtrack on its earlier warning that the UK would suffer instant damage from the Brexit vote. Its latest upgrade to the 2017 outlook follows official figures suggesting the UK economy ended 2016 on a strong note. However, the tone of the thinktank\u2019s interim outlook chimed with more recent UK indicators that suggest households are reining in spending as a weakening pound raises prices. The currency\u2019s fall since the Brexit vote has made imports more expensive and some of that is being passed on to consumers. The OECD report said: \u201cIn the United Kingdom, the pace of expansion in 2016 was lower than in previous years, despite support from resilient household spending, actions by the Bank of England and adjustment to the fiscal stance following the Brexit vote. \u201cUK growth is expected to ease further as rising inflation weighs on real incomes and consumption, and business investment weakens amidst uncertainty about the United Kingdom\u2019s future trading relations with its partners.\u201d Its outlook for the world economy remained unchanged from November, with global growth pencilled in at 3.3% this year. That would be faster than the 3% in 2016, but below the historical average of about 4% in the two decades before the global financial crisis. The OECD said there were various risks to global growth, including what it called \u201cdisconnects\u201d between rallying financial markets and economic reality. Against the backdrop of recent record highs for stock markets in the US and UK, it noted the market mood did not reflect the true economic outlook. In the wake of Trump\u2019s plans to roll back trade deals, it also warned that rising protectionism could \u201churt global growth and impact the large number of jobs that depends on trade\u201d. The report sought to flag up \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d in some richer nations where exceptionally low interest rates have been accompanied by rising house prices. \u201cSome countries have experienced rapid house price increases in recent years, including Australia, Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom. As past experience has shown, a rapid rise of house prices can be a precursor of an economic downturn.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Caution was the watchword for investors, ahead of some key events later in the week, notably the UK budget, the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, and the US non-farm payroll numbers. With President Trump knocking healthcare shares after reinforcing the idea of cutting drug prices, markets were struggling for direction. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 11.13 points or 0.15% at 7338.99 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.06% to 11,966.14 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.35% at 4955.00 on continuing concerns about the presidential election Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.03% to 19,455.05 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.02% at 9801.7 In Greece, the Athens market dipped 0.05% to 643.16 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 26 points or 0.12%. On that note, it\u2019t time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and come back tomorrow for our coverage of the UK budget. Snap, the parent of Snapchat, made an explosive debut on the New York Stock Exchange last week. Shares in the business soared 44% from their initial $17 on Thursday, the first day of dealing, and added another 10% a day later in heavy trading. But since then the shares have dropped, falling 12% on Monday and another 11% so far on Tuesday to around $21. Most analysts have been negative on the stock with four out of six analysts recommending selling the shares, and the other two having a neutral rating. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Although [Snap] remains well above the $17 IPO price, momentum has turned ugly. The question is whether this is early investors locking in profits, or whether this heralds a move to a more realistic valuation for this hyped, but risky, early-stage stock. Back with the appointment of Charlotte Hogg as deputy governor of the Bank of England after it emerged she had not told the bank her brother worked at Barclays, prompting a potential conflict of interest. After a critical Treasury committee hearing earlier, the chair of the committee Andrew Tyrie has issued a statement: The Committee now needs to digest the evidence it has heard today, some of which has been a surprise to a number of us. It will offer a view after a period of reflection. The committee said it would return to the matter after Wednesday\u2019s budget. One Labour MP, John Mann, has already called for Hogg to resign over the issue. Given the tensions over the US trade deficit with Germany, this could be interesting: Trump\u2019s talk of cracking down on drug pricing has also unsettled European pharmaceutical companies. Novartis is down 1.7%, Roche has fallen 1.23%, Shire has lost 2.2%, while AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline are both almost 1% lower. President Trump has been at it again. A tweet suggesting plans to cut drug prices has hit pharmaceutical shares and helped push Wall Street lower at the open: So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 33 points or 0.16% while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.17% lower and the Nasdaq Composite off 0.21%. Pfizer is down 1.3% while Merck is 1.5% lower. Will any European countries end up leaving the eurozone? Apart from Greece, the chances are low, according to Moody\u2019s, but could get higher. In a new report, it said: The likelihood of a country other than Greece leaving the European Union\u2019s single currency area remains very low, but has the potential to increase materially this year given the rise of anti-EU political parties in the region. While it is unlikely that any of these parties will gain sufficient electoral support to seek a mandate for exit from the euro area in the near future, they can still influence political agendas, potentially weakening support for euro area membership... \u201cAside from Greece, Moody\u2019s believes that the likelihood of a country leaving the euro area remains very low,\u201d said Colin Ellis, Moody\u2019s Chief Credit Officer for EMEA and the report\u2019s co-author. \u201cHowever, this probability could increase over coming months, depending on the results of upcoming elections.\u201d Any exit from the European single currency would be an existential moment for the euro area: it would demonstrate conclusively that the currency union was not indivisible. A country leaving the euro area and redenominating its currency would not necessarily automatically result in a default, however. In that situation, Moody\u2019s would in particular focus on any change in the financial value of debt obligations relative to the original contractual promise. Over to the US and - in news which will not please Donald Trump - the country\u2019s trade deficit in January widened to its highest level since March 2012. With rising oil prices pushing up the cost of imported fuel, the trade gap increased 9.6% to $48.5bn compared to the December figure of $44.3bn, according to the Commerce Department. Trump sees trade as one of the key areas to tackle, and has already said he will pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement. Exports to the European Union fell 7.3%, and Trump advisors have already hit out at Germany for benefiting from a weak euro. The trade deficit with the United Kingdom rose from $457m to $609m. Meanwhile the deficit with China, another contentious area for Trump, rose by 12.8% to $31.1bn in January. But the trade deficit with Mexico - where Trump has continued to push plans for a border wall - fell 10.1% to its lowest level since July 2015. Here\u2019s our news story about Charlotte Hogg\u2019s non-disclosure, which sparked such a rumpus at the Treasury committee today: Newsflash: John Mann MP has declare that Charlotte Hogg\u2019s position as deputy governor is \u201cnow untenable\u201d, following her admission that she didn\u2019t declare that her brother hold a senior role in Barclays\u2019 strategy team. In a statement just released, Mann MP argues that Hogg has failed to meet the principles of public life, known as the \u201cNolan principles\u201d (a point he made during today\u2019s hearing). Mann says: \u201cIt is simply incredible that such a senior person at the Bank of England has behaved in such in this manner. Last week Charlotte Hogg proudly told this committee that she actually wrote the bank\u2019s code of conduct which she has now admitted to repeatedly breaking it.\u201d \u201cNot only has she compromised her current position and the Bank of England itself but more importantly she has failed under the key principles of the Nolan standards in public life and she has no excuse for doing so.\u201d \u201cThis is simply a question about standards in public life and in this regard she has failed and must resign.\u201d You can watch the entire Treasury Committee hearing about Charlotte Hogg\u2019s non-declaration here. Andrew Tyrie wraps up the hearing by saying that we are \u201clooking at a mistake, a series of mistakes\u201d. We need to examine if the response from the bank has been proportionate. There are three issues to discuss, Tyrie argues: Whether, and to what extent, we can ensure this doesn\u2019t become a case of \u2018do what I say, not what I do\u2019 for a very serious member of the Bank Need to protect the reputation of the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Committee, which oversees UK banks What it says about the role of the Court in the Bank\u2019s governance. Tyrie concludes by telling Anthony Habgood and Bradley Fried that this morning\u2019s news about Charlotte Hogg has been a surprise to a number of committee members, including himself, and they must \u201cthink very carefully\u201d about it. Charlotte Hogg has also officially recorded her family links to the Hoare family -- who created Britain\u2019s oldest private bank, Habgood says. Q: Have any other senior Bank of England staff updated their declarations under the code of conduct since Charlotte Hogg\u2019s omission came to light? Anthony Habgood says that several people have, yes, including one who has added that his daughter is a political journalist. Deputy court chairman Bradley Fried now hits back at the suggestion that Charlotte Hogg\u2019s conduct has fallen below acceptable standards. Despite this lack of disclosure over her brother, I believe she is a \u201csuperb public servant\u201d says Fried. His personal view is that Hogg does meet standards of the best of public life laid out in the code. We are living with the \u201cdisappointment and aggravation\u201d of her non-disclosure right now, Fried adds. And he suggests this affair will be a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d in Hogg\u2019s career, and also in the way that senior Bank executives report any potential conflicts of interest. Scottish Nationalist Party MP George Kerevan reads out the Bank\u2019s code of conduct. Q: The code of conduct on interests says that \u201cliving within our code is not simply about observing the letter of the policies referred to. We aspire to set an example of the best in public service.\u201d By that test, has Ms Hogg failed it? BoE Court chairman Anthony Habgood replies that She has omitted something that she should not have omitted, that is important, so she has not lived up to that code. Q: So do you stand by the code? Absolutely we stand by the code, Habgood adds. Q: What effect will her non-compliance have on the rest of the bank staff, and the way they see the code? We will push the code harder, Habgood says, but it is hard as it relies on self-assessment. For example, someone\u2019s second son might move from a non-regulated City firm to a regulated one - so they\u2019d need to update their records. We have moved a long way from a few years ago, when the Bank didn\u2019t really have a code of conduct, Habgood adds (somewhat alarmingly!) Tory MP Kit Malthouse is concerned that the Bank of England doesn\u2019t know exactly what Quintin Hogg does at Barclays. He could even be targeted with handling Barclay\u2019s strategy towards the Bank of England, Malthouse suggests. We could find out, Habgood concedes. But even if that were the case, he thinks it wouldn\u2019t have affected Charlotte Hogg\u2019s suitability to be deputy governor. Now the committee ask about social ties between the top brass at the Bank of England. Court chairman Anthony Habgood insists that he\u2019s had no social interaction with Charlotte Hogg -- beyond one trip to \u201csomething to do with ballet for youthful people\u201d. I didn\u2019t know her until just before I came to the bank. But Habgood then reveals other ties to the Hogg dynasty. I know her mother better than I know her because she\u2019s been chairman of various things when I\u2019ve been chairman of various things. Charlotte Hogg\u2019s mother is Sarah Hogg, the first woman to chair a FTSE 100 company (3i, back in 2002). She\u2019s married to Douglas Martin Hogg, son of the late Lord Hailsham, and a former Tory MP (until his expenses claim for moat-cleaning came to light...) Fried adds: Anthony [Habgood]and I are fans of Charlotte. We think she\u2019s a distinctive professional. Conservative MP Kit Malthouse wants to know what the Court of the Bank of England (the board of the central bank) is going to do about Hogg\u2019s breach of the code. Deputy chairman Bradley Fried says the situation will be discussed. Clearly we have an issue now around optics. We hope that it can be resolved. It\u2019s not an issue how we feel individually. We will discuss it in full Court. Chairman Anthony Habgood then weighs in, saying they don\u2019t expect to recommend reversing Hogg\u2019s appointment as deputy governor of the BoE. Why not, asks Tyrie? Because the process of having Hogg\u2019s line manager (Mark Carney), and the head of HR looking into the issue has been concluded, Habgood explains. Earlier in this hearing, deputy court chairman Bradley Fried said Hogg had committed an \u201cunwillful act of omission.\u201d Bloomberg has the details: \u201cI definitely don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a hanging offence,\u201d Fried told Parliament Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly unfortunate. It warrants grumpiness.\u201d Anthony Habgood says he has discussed the situation with governor Mark Carney -- apparently it was a \u201crevelation\u201d to Carney that Charlotte Hogg hadn\u2019t declared her brother\u2019s role at Barclays. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie wants more answers from BoE chairman Anthony Habgood. Q: How many breaches of the Bank\u2019s code of conduct are there? Habgood doesn\u2019t know. I think it might be helpful to know, Tyrie points out. Q: What are the sanctions for failing to make a voluntary declaration? It depends on the seriousness of it, Habgood says. In most cases, he\u2019d expect that the line manager and the HR department would speak to the individual and take a view. Q: So why didn\u2019t Charlotte Hogg declare her brother\u2019s role as a Barclays strategy director when she was hired as chief operating officer in 2013? Habgood insists that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cwilful\u201d decision. He suggests that Hogg didn\u2019t feel that her brother was in a position where it mattered - which was a mistake as she she shouldn\u2019t take that decision. It was also an issue of priorities but it should have been high up her list of priorities as Charlotte Hogg helped develop the codes, Habgood points out... Labour MP John Mann is now laying into the Bank of England\u2019s top brass -- comparing Charlotte Hogg\u2019s conduct to MPs who were jailed in the expenses scandal. The standards of public life are about ethics and public responsibility, Mann insists. He demands to know who is going to \u201csanction\u201d Hogg for not declaring her brother\u2019s role at Barclays back in 2013. Mann tells BoE Court chairman Anthony Habgood that: She\u2019s broken the standards in public life....and you\u2019ve done nothing about it.... You must see that the independence of the Court is being brought into question. Habgood says any sanction is the responsibility of her line manager, governor Mark Carney. And he points out that Hogg did declare her brother\u2019s role to the committee in her written submission last month (it\u2019s online here). The problem, though, is that she didn\u2019t declare it back in 2013 when she joined the Bank. Habgood says: The standard is broken, that is correct. But he argues that this isn\u2019t a \u2018black and white\u2019 issue -- the Court must consider a range of factors (Hogg is highly regarded at the BoE). And there is definitely no personal gain here, Habgood insists. The Treasury Committee are laying into the Bank of England\u2019s top brass over Charlotte Hogg\u2019s failure to declare that her brother works for Barclays. Jacob Rees-Mogg (who knows a thing or two about high society), is challenging the idea that there hasn\u2019t been a conflict of interest, actual or potential. There aren\u2019t a lot of people in the City called Quintin Hogg, points out Rees-Mogg. He adds: What\u2019s worrying me is that the bank and the Court is pretty complacent about this. It can\u2019t have been wrong because we wouldn\u2019t have behaved like that. We won\u2019t investigate it - we\u2019ll just say there\u2019s no conflict because the brother\u2019s probably like us, he\u2019s another good chap. Rees-Mogg is also unimpressed that Anthony Habgood doesn\u2019t seem to actually know what Hogg. Q does at Barclays. Deputy chairman Bradley Fried hits back at the suggestion that the Bank is a cushy institution where family background counts for a lot. We\u2019re a \u201cdeeply forensic, fact-based institution\u201d he insists. Now this is awkward.... Charlotte Hogg, the newly appointed deputy governor of the Bank of England, has admitted that she failed to disclose that her brother works for Barclays Bank. It\u2019s a clear, and highly embarrassing, breach of the BoE\u2019s code of conduct. Last month, Hogg told MPs Treasury Committee that she had reported her brother\u2019s role as a strategy director at Barclays to the Bank, when she joined as its chief operating officer in 2013. But now, in a letter to the Treasury Committee released this morning, Hogg admits that she didn\u2019t. Here\u2019s the key section: During my appointment hearing on 28 February 2017,1 was asked by you and other members of the Committee about my brother\u2019s role as Director, Group Strategy at Barclays Bank pic. Following my hearing, I checked the Bank\u2019s records of the interests and relationships that I had declared prior to joining the Bank in July 2013 and subsequently. I had not formally declared my brother\u2019s role at Barclays Bank pic to the Bank. The first time that I formally outlined my brother\u2019s role was when I noted it in the questionnaire which I submitted to the Committee in advance of my recent hearing. As Barclays Bank pic is regulated by the PRA, under the Bank\u2019s internal code of conduct and personal relationships policy, I should have formally declared my brother\u2019s role when I first joined the Bank. I did not do so and I take full responsibility for this oversight. I have now added a full record of my brother\u2019s role in the Bank\u2019s HR systems. Regrettably, my oversight means that my oral evidence to the Committee in this respect was not accurate. I write now to correct that evidence at the earliest opportunity and to place on record my sincere apologies to the Committee. Hogg adds that the Secretary of the Bank and the Chaiman of the Bank\u2019s Court of Directors, Anthony Habgood, agree that there has not been any actual or potential conflict of interest. But Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury committee, isn\u2019t impressed at all. He\u2019s quizzing Habgood about the issue now in parliament. Tyrie argues that this relationship becomes a \u201cmuch more serious issue\u201d now that Hogg has been promoted to deputy governor. And doesn\u2019t this breach show how seriously the Bank does (or doesn\u2019t) take its approach to compliance? Habgood agrees that this is \u201ca very serious breach\u201d of the Bank\u2019s compliance code.... Economics blogger Tim Worstall has a good take on the German factory orders decline, on Forbes. Here\u2019s a flavour: Reading too much into just the one month\u2019s numbers is not a sensible thing to be doing so the answer to that headline question, as Betteridge\u2019s Law says it should be, is probably no. However, when matters do turn against the German economy this is the sort of thing that we would expect to see. We all know, or at least we all should know, that the German economy is rather different from those of other advanced countries. It has about double the manufacturing of those others and that manufacturing is rather more concentrated into durable goods than most others. It\u2019s thus vulnerable to a slow down in investment in other economies... More here: It\u2019s a bad morning for hundreds of workers at Budgens stores across the country. Some 34 Budgens stores are closing after administrators failed to find a buyer for their owner, Food Retailer Operations Limited (FROL). These stores employ around 815 workers. However (and contrary to some reports), this doesn\u2019t mean that the entire Budgens chain is toast. Instead, around 150 other outlets are still in business. Charles Wilson, chief executive of Booker, told my colleague Julia Kollewe that: \u201cThe business is performing very strongly.\u201d Budgens stores are usually run by independent retailers, while the brand is owned by Bookers -- which is being taken over by Tesco. Breaking: The OECD thinktank has just become the latest organisation to admit that it overestimated the impact of the Brexit vote on the UK economy. The Paris-based group now expects Britain\u2019s GDP to rise by 1.6% this year, up from 1.2% previously. My colleague Katie Allen says it\u2019s a boost to chancellor Philip Hammond ahead of tomorrow\u2019s budget. The new forecasts envisage the UK economy performing in line with the eurozone economy, where GDP is also expected to expand by 1.6% in 2017. The US economy, helped in part by an expected rise in spending under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, is forecast to grow 2.4% this year. The OECD still has concerns about the UK economy, and is warning that inflation will hurt growth. More here: The news that UK house price growth has hit its lowest level since July 2013 has disappointed some economists. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight predicts that the market will be muted in 2017: February\u2019s slight rise in house prices reported by the Halifax fuels our belief that house price gains over 2017 will be no more than 3% and could well be less. Weakening consumer fundamentals, likely mounting caution over making major spending decisions, and elevated house price to earnings ratios are likely to weigh down on house prices. However, a shortage of supply is likely to put a hard floor under prices. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, says potential buyers are being cautious: \u201cHalifax\u2019s latest data reflects the cautious nature of the market; with value sensitive buyers remaining committed to their moving plans, but only at the right price. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, doesn\u2019t believe we\u2019re heading for a crash: \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to make a call on whether the property market is cooling off. While it\u2019s possible this is a sign of things to come demand is still so high and supply so lacking so I can\u2019t see a dramatic slump on the horizon quite yet. \u201cAffordability is a major issue and if rising inflation means households are strapped for cash getting onto or moving up the ladder will be more difficult and that will impact prices. The changes to tax on rental properties have also meant more would-be landlords are holding back from buying too which has an effect. Rob Weaver, Director of Investments at property crowdfunding platform Property Partner, thinks the lack of housing supply will keep propping prices up. \u201cDespite continuing uncertainty, a buoyant jobs market, record low interest rates and the imbalance between high demand for homes and a severe shortage in supply continue to put upward pressure on prices. Britain\u2019s house market appears to be weakening, with prices growing at their weakest rate in over three years. Prices rose by an annual rate of 5.1% in the three months to February, according to the Halifax building society. That\u2019s down from 5.7% the previous month, and the weakest rate since July 2013. In February alone, prices inched up by 0.1% - weaker than the 0.4% expected by City economists. Halifax\u2019s Martin Ellis predicts that price growth will keep falling, bringing it closer to wage growth. Ellis says: \u201cA sustained period of house price growth in excess of pay rises has made it increasingly difficult for many to purchase a home. This development, together with signs of reduced momentum in the jobs market and squeezed consumer spending power, is expected to curb house price growth during 2017.\u201d These factory orders numbers are rather weaker than other German data, points out Bloomberg: Ifo\u2019s business climate index improved in February amid strong activity in manufacturing and services, and unemployment continued to decline. And last week, we got very decent PMI figures suggesting that German factories were \u2018humming\u2019 in March.. Even if you strip out orders for expensive transport equipment, German factories had a bad January: Financial analysts are concerned by the scale of the drop in German factory orders at the start of 2017. Carsten Brzeski at ING says the 7.4% slide is \u201calmost unprecedented\u201d, \u201cToday\u2019s disappointing data is also a good reminder that the German industry is having more problems returning to full speed than buoyant sentiment indicators have been suggesting\u201d. Fred Ducrozet of Swiss bank Pictet points out that demand for large machinery and expensive equipment (known as capital goods) fell particularly rapidly Claus Vistesen of Pantheon says the figures are \u2018horrible\u2019, but doesn\u2019t want to read too much into a single month\u2019s data. Andreas Wallstr\u00f6m of Nordea Markets provides more context: Germany\u2019s manufacturing sector has suffered a surprisingly sharp fall in orders, raising concerns that its economy may not be as robust as thought. Orders for German factory goods plunged by 7.4% in January, compared to December. That\u2019s much worse than the 2.5% drop which analysts expected. The dropoff appears to have been driven by a decline in orders within Germany itself. This domestic demand fell by 10.5%. Foreign orders slid by 4.9% -- including a 7.8% fall in demand from the euro zone. That\u2019s not a great signal for the euro area, which had shown signs of more robust growth recently. We shouldn\u2019t read TOO much into one month\u2019s data -- especially as the German factory orders report is notoriously volatile... Germany\u2019s finance ministry is urging calm, saying: \u201cThe weak start to the year should be manageable. Business confidence in manufacturing is significantly brighter than the long-term average, so that a revival in manufacturing can still be expected.\u201d I\u2019ll pull together more reaction now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Consumer spending has been propping the UK economy up since last summer\u2019s EU referendum. But there are now signs that the retail sector is feeling a chill. A new survey this morning shows that retail sales slid by 0.2% in the three months to February, compared with a year earlier. Non-food sales are dropping for the first time in five years, suggesting consumers are tightening their belts as the economy slows. Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium, which compiled the report, warns: \u201cTougher times are expected ahead. The impact of inflation on consumer spending will add further intensity to an already fiercely competitive environment in which the ability to adapt and innovate will be key to survival.\u201d Faced with slowing sales, retailers are now pleading with the government to rethink its business rates changes - perhaps as soon as in tomorrow\u2019s Budget? Also coming up today..... We get a new healthcheck on the global economy at 10am GMT, with the latest forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The car industry has flocked to Geneva for the annual Motor Show, where they\u2019ll be showing off new models and concept cars. Closer to home, Vauxhall car workers will be thinking about the future after being sold by General Motors yesterday. PSA Group, their new owners, has promised that job cuts aren\u2019t inevitable. But although Vauxhall\u2019s two UK plants are relatively efficient, they could still lose out. My colleague Graham Ruddick explains: Vauxhall\u2019s factories in Ellesmere Port and Luton will have to battle with Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn, and Opel plants across Europe to win the right to produce vehicles beyond 2021. The future of Vauxhall\u2019s sites is secure until then because PSA Group, which has bought Vauxhall and Opel from General Motors, has pledged to recognise existing production commitments. Ellesmere Port is scheduled to produce the Astra until 2021 while Luton will make the Vivaro van until 2025. However, PSA will have to make a decision on where to produce the next-generation Astra from 2021 as early as next year, and Ellesmere Port faces a significant challenge to win the work and secure its survival.... More here: European stock markets are expected to rally a little, pushing the FTSE 100 back towards last week\u2019s record highs. On the corporate news front, bookmaker Paddy Power, online food delivery form Just Eat and insurance firm Direct Line are reporting results. And Halifax are scheduled to release their latest UK house price figures, at 8.30am GMT. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day...",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "WH Smith is such a British institution that criticism of it hurts a bit \u2013 even if it charged you \u00a31.60 for a bottle of water and tried to sell you a bar of chocolate at the till on your last visit. James Daunt, managing director of Waterstones, said WH Smith had \u201cgodawful uniformity\u201d and \u201ccrushing consistency\u201d. If only consistency was its sole problem. Follow the entertaining (and rather dispiriting) @WHS_carpet Twitter account and the stores look unloved, rather than uniform. There are pictures of peeling flooring and botched repairs, and abandoned boxes and crates on the shop floor. WH Smith was founded in 1792 and has become an integral part of British high-street life \u2013 but in recent years it has suffered. As a damning piece in Management Today pointed out in 2015, it made rising profits on falling sales by under-investing and pushing up prices (particularly in store locations where there is little other choice, such as train stations and \u2013 more scandalously \u2013 hospitals). What can be done to save it? Consistency doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018crushing\u2019 Around 700 WH Smith stores are in railway stations, airports and service stations, and around 600 are on the high street. Consistency is fine for the travel outlets, where speed is key but, on the high street, stores need to be more interesting, says Cate Trotter, head of trends at Insider Trends, a retail futures consultancy. \u201cTo get people to visit and keep them in the store, you want to offer something different for them to discover. It could be about making the stores different from each other, so, whatever high street you\u2019re on, there\u2019s always a reason to go in.\u201d One way to do this could be to give staff of each branch more autonomy, as Waterstones does. Receiving orders from head office, says Trotter, means \u201cstaff don\u2019t feel inspired and that will crush the experience\u201d. Become a community hub According to WH Smith, 73% of the population visit the store every year \u2013 and some outlets also serve as the town\u2019s post office \u2013 but it could make more of its community presence. Trotter suggests it could make bigger events of in-store book signings, or run arts-and-crafts classes. \u201cEven revision classes \u2013 they could have a GCSE maths session. It\u2019s about giving people a reason to go in and spend time.\u201d Be inspiring \u2013 or be cheap \u201cWaterstones is very inspirational \u2013 it has coffee shops, events, readings,\u201d says Heiner Evanschitzky, professor of marketing and a director at the Aston Centre for Retail Insights. WH Smith is not quite so stimulating. But, he says, \u201cyou can be inspirational and still have a standardised business model where everything is cost-and-efficiency-driven.\u201d The store needs to work out what it is \u2013 currently, the prices are too high to compete with the pound shops, but it does not offer a luxurious shopping experience. \u201cIt has the Tesco problem where it wants to be everything to everybody, and that tends not to work out.\u201d Or don\u2019t change much at all You wouldn\u2019t invent WH Smith as a store now, says John Pal, senior lecturer in retail at the University of Manchester. It has evolved over time into a business that relies on its location and convenience. Going to his local branch, says Pal, is \u201cnot a particularly pleasant experience but it serves a purpose\u201d. You can pick up a magazine, a printer refill, a lottery ticket. \u201cIf it starts to refit and invest a lot of money, the only way that will be paid for is through increased prices. Onlookers might look down their nose and say it\u2019s a bit soulless, but it has become a convenience store and it capitalises on that high footfall traffic.\u201d Maybe get some new carpets, though.",

      "body": "<p>WH Smith is such a British institution that criticism of it hurts a bit \u2013 even if it charged you \u00a31.60 for a bottle of water and tried to sell you a bar of chocolate at the till on your last visit. James Daunt, managing director of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/waterstones\">Waterstones</a>, said WH Smith had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/06/waterstones-boss-attacks-godawful-uniformity-of-chains-such-as-wh-smith\">\u201cgodawful uniformity\u201d and \u201ccrushing consistency\u201d</a>. If only consistency was its sole problem. Follow the entertaining (and rather dispiriting) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHS_Carpet?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@WHS_carpet</a> Twitter account and the stores look unloved, rather than uniform. There are pictures of peeling flooring and botched repairs, and abandoned boxes and crates on the shop floor.</p> <p>WH Smith was founded in 1792 and has become an integral part of British high-street life \u2013 but in recent years it has suffered. As <a href=\"http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/dismal-decline-whsmith/article/1369095\">a damning piece in Management Today</a> pointed out in 2015, it made rising profits on falling sales by under-investing and pushing up prices (particularly in store locations where there is little other choice, such as train stations and \u2013 more scandalously \u2013 hospitals). What can be done to save it?</p> <h2><strong>Consistency doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018crushing\u2019</strong><br></h2> <p>Around 700 WH Smith stores are in railway stations, airports and service stations, and around 600 are on the high street. Consistency is fine for the travel outlets, where speed is key but, on the high street, stores need to be more interesting, says Cate Trotter, head of trends at Insider Trends, a retail futures consultancy. \u201cTo get people to visit and keep them in the store, you want to offer something different for them to discover. It could be about making the stores different from each other, so, whatever high street you\u2019re on, there\u2019s always a reason to go in.\u201d One way to do this could be to give staff of each branch more autonomy, as Waterstones does. Receiving orders from head office, says Trotter, means \u201cstaff don\u2019t feel inspired and that will crush the experience\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Become a community hub</strong><br></h2> <p>According to WH Smith, <a href=\"https://life.spectator.co.uk/2016/12/wh-smith-become-national-embarrassment/\">73% of the population visit the store every year</a> \u2013 and some outlets also serve as the town\u2019s post office \u2013 but it could make more of its community presence. Trotter suggests it could make bigger events of in-store book signings, or run arts-and-crafts classes. \u201cEven revision classes \u2013 they could have a GCSE maths session. It\u2019s about giving people a reason to go in and spend time.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Be inspiring \u2013 or be cheap</strong><br></h2> <p>\u201cWaterstones is very inspirational \u2013 it has coffee shops, events, readings,\u201d says Heiner Evanschitzky, professor of marketing and a director at the Aston Centre for Retail Insights. WH Smith is not quite so stimulating. But, he says, \u201cyou can be inspirational and still have a standardised business model where everything is cost-and-efficiency-driven.\u201d The store needs to work out what it is \u2013 currently, the prices are too high to compete with the pound shops, but it does not offer a luxurious shopping experience. \u201cIt has the Tesco problem where it wants to be everything to everybody, and that tends not to work out.\u201d<br></p> <h2><strong>Or don\u2019t change much at all</strong></h2> <p>You wouldn\u2019t invent WH Smith as a store now, says John Pal, senior lecturer in retail at the University of Manchester. It has evolved over time into a business that relies on its location and convenience. Going to his local branch, says Pal, is \u201cnot a particularly pleasant experience but it serves a purpose\u201d. You can pick up a magazine, a printer refill, a lottery ticket. \u201cIf it starts to refit and invest a lot of money, the only way that will be paid for is through increased prices. Onlookers might look down their nose and say it\u2019s a bit soulless, but it has become a convenience store and it capitalises on that high footfall traffic.\u201d Maybe get some new carpets, though.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "A music archive regarded as one of the most important collections from the golden age of rock \u2013 thousands of tapes and videos featuring such artists as Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, the Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and Fleetwood Mac \u2013 is at the centre of a legal dispute in which Keith Richards and Pete Townshend could be called to testify in a Manhattan courtroom. The dispute focuses on Wolfgang\u2019s Vault, a concert-streaming service and memorabilia marketplace that owns the archives of Bill Graham, a rock promoter without whom the 60s music scene in San Francisco and New York might have looked very different. At issue is whether the company has the right to stream thousands of archived concert films and music recordings. In a case brought by publishers contesting the copyright, the Rolling Stones and Who musicians, along with David Byrne of Talking Heads, are set to testify in the coming weeks. The case reaches back into a famous era of rock. The material was amassed by Graham, who ran the Fillmore theatre in San Francisco \u2013 venue for acts such as Janis Joplin and Jefferson Airplane \u2013 and later the Fillmore East in New York. Graham is regarded by many as the original rock promoter. He put on arena shows and developed the T-shirt merchandising business. Townshend once described him as \u201cone of the great mavericks who redefined what freedom really meant in the US\u201d. Graham preserved merchandise and memorabilia from concerts, including T-shirts, posters, tickets and backstage passes, and also kept the audio and video recordings of many performances. Over his career, he may have staged as many as 35,000 shows. The Wall Street Journal called the stash \u201cthe most important collection of rock memorabilia and recordings ever assembled\u201d. Graham died in a helicopter crash in 1991; a decade later, the entire Bill Graham Presents archive was purchased for $5m by the Minneapolis entrepreneur Bill Sagan. But neither Sagan nor the seller, the radio giant Clear Channel, realised the archive contained a treasure trove of live recordings. Sagan then set up Wolfgang\u2019s Vault as a marketing and streaming site, now at the centre of the dispute. The National Music Publishers Association claims Wolfgang\u2019s Vault has profited \u201cin large part because of the significant use of unlicensed music\u201d; in a counterclaim, Sagan claims he is \u201cbeing forced to choose between depriving the music-loving public of the inimitable collection, or selling the assets to its member publishers at a steep discount\u201d. The recordings were made legally but distributing them without various permissions and revenue-sharing agreements is problematic. Part of Sagan\u2019s defence is to cast doubt on artists\u2019 copyright registrations, which is when his legal representatives began requesting depositions, which Richards and Byrne have so far resisted. Complicating the situation are the songwriters\u2019 own legal tangles, which in the case of the Rolling Stones means they do not own the rights to many of their early compositions. Neither the band\u2019s representatives, nor Wolfgang\u2019s Vault, returned requests for comment. The Hollywood Reporter found that in the case of Townshend\u2019s publishing rights, copyright registration could not be found. That was countered with the argument that registration wasn\u2019t necessary because the Who\u2019s songs were foreign works. But a source familiar with the dispute said that only the size of the catalogue makes the case unusual. In every other respect it\u2019s a simple case of copyright infringement. \u201cThere\u2019s only so long you can get away with, \u2018hey, it was the 60s and this was rock\u2019n\u2019roll in Frisco\u2019. This was still a business in the 60s, and the law was still the law in the 60s. This can\u2019t just be live and let live because it was the 60s in San Francisco, or anyplace else,\u201d said the source. But with the music business beginning to recover from the disruption of the digital era, rock fans will be hoping that performances by artists including Bob Dylan and Bob Marley, and concert tapes that include the last ever show the Sex Pistols performed with their original line-up, will not simply disappear altogether. Among the gems is a recording taken from Led Zeppelin\u2019s first US tour, in 1969 \u2013 when the band was opening for Country Joe &amp; the Fish \u2013 which finds lead singer Robert Plant chatting amiably to the audience before he developed into a priapic rock god. But after years of losses and piracy, music copyright holders may be in no mood to compromise. It was recently revealed that Alphabet, the owner of YouTube, which is now the largest streamer of music, pays copyright holders less than the tiny but vibrant vinyl record reproduction industry. None of which diminishes the singular achievement of Graham, a German immigrant who, aged four, fled the Nazis in 1939 and, by some accounts, walked from Paris to Marseille before eventually reaching the US. Early in his career managing the Fillmore, he booked the shows, took tickets at the front door, cleaned the bathrooms between sets, placed a mirrorball over the audience, and put a barrel of apples by the entrance to the ballroom with a sign that read, \u201cTake One, or Two\u201d. Graham brought the Doors and Jimi Hendrix to San Francisco for the first time and saw an opportunity to bring the second wave of the British invasion to California. After booking the Who to play the Monterey Pop festival in 1967, he invited Cream to play six nights at the Fillmore. The band didn\u2019t have enough songs, forcing them to extend what they did have, giving them a name for virtuosity.",

      "bodyText": "Levels of violence at the last G4S-run child jail have been \u201cvery high\u201d and the number of times staff have used force has doubled in the past year, according to an inspection report. An Ofsted report into Oakhill secure training centre (STC), near Milton Keynes, says that inspectors witnessed staff \u201cstruggling to maintain order and control\u201d and a subsequent \u201cover-reliance on more extreme measures \u2026 including a high level of the use of force\u201d. The inspectors say the decision by the private security company, G4S, to sell its children\u2019s services sector after a BBC Panorama programme about an abuse scandal and cover-up at Medway child jail last year has been a key factor in problems at Oakhill, with an increasing number of staff leaving. Oakhill is the last of the three G4S-run child jails. Medway STC was taken back into the public sector after the Panorama undercover expos\u00e9 and a third STC, Rainsbrook in Northamptonshire, was transferred to MTC Novo last year. It is believed that a decision to sell the contract for Oakhill to the Working Links charity is awaiting Ministry of Justice approval. The joint inspection by Ofsted, the chief inspector of prisons and the Care Quality Commission, says that the achievement of young people at Oakhill, which can take up to 80 children, has improved since their last inspection in late 2015, but the promotion of positive behaviour is inadequate. They say difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff have been heightened by rising levels of violence. Some newer staff are less resilient or confident in coping with an older group of more challenging young people, with more than half the children aged 16-18, and staffing support from other G4S child jails is no longer possible. \u201cThe number of incidents when staff had used force has doubled since the last inspection. There were more than 70 incidents every month between July and December 2016, despite a reduction in the number of young people in the centre during much of this period. Levels of force used in the two weeks immediately prior to the inspection were particularly high,\u201d says the report. The inspectors say this is partly because Oakhill does not have an effective or consistent approach to managing young people\u2019s behaviour. \u201cThis has led to a concerning rise in inappropriate behaviour. Inspectors witnessed some staff on some units struggling to maintain order and control. As a consequence, there was an escalation of poor behaviour and an over-reliance on more extreme measures to address this, including a high level of use of force by staff. This was often in response to assaults by young people.\u201d Responding to the report, Jerry Petherick, the managing director of G4S custodial and detention services, said: \u201cWe experienced a number of challenges at Oakhill during early 2016 leading to significant attrition of staff, which previously would have been mitigated by support from other G4S secure training centres. In response, we requested a reduction in the number of children placed at Oakhill to make changes at the centre and to support the management team, appoint a new head of safeguarding, reduce staff attrition and launch a vigorous recruitment campaign. \u201cWhile inspectors acknowledge that the director has a purposeful vision to tackle Oakhill\u2019s challenges and there has been change and improvement during the latter half of 2016, there is still a great deal more to do.\u201d Petherick added that although G4S was committed to the sale of Oakhill, the company remained accountable for the young people in its care and staff would continue to provide support to make improvements.",

Medway STC was taken back into the public sector after the Panorama undercover expos\u00e9 and a third STC, Rainsbrook in Northamptonshire, was transferred to MTC Novo last year. It is believed that a decision to sell the contract for Oakhill to the Working Links charity is awaiting Ministry of Justice approval.</p> <p>The joint inspection by Ofsted, the chief inspector of prisons and the Care Quality Commission, says that the achievement of young people at Oakhill, which can take up to 80 children, has improved since their last inspection in late 2015, but the promotion of positive behaviour is inadequate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/17/scandal-g4s-youth-jail-medway-inmates\">Scandal-hit G4S-run Medway youth jail resumes taking inmates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They say difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff have been heightened by rising levels of violence. Some newer staff are less resilient or confident in coping with an older group of more challenging young people, with more than half the children aged 16-18, and staffing support from other G4S child jails is no longer possible.</p> <p>\u201cThe number of incidents when staff had used force has doubled since the last inspection. There were more than 70 incidents every month between July and December 2016, despite a reduction in the number of young people in the centre during much of this period. Levels of force used in the two weeks immediately prior to the inspection were particularly high,\u201d says the report.</p> <p>The inspectors say this is partly because Oakhill does not have an effective or consistent approach to managing young people\u2019s behaviour. </p> <p>\u201cThis has led to a concerning rise in inappropriate behaviour. Inspectors witnessed some staff on some units struggling to maintain order and control. As a consequence, there was an escalation of poor behaviour and an over-reliance on more extreme measures to address this, including a high level of use of force by staff. This was often in response to assaults by young people.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the report, Jerry Petherick, the managing director of G4S custodial and detention services, said: \u201cWe experienced a number of challenges at Oakhill during early 2016 leading to significant attrition of staff, which previously would have been mitigated by support from other G4S secure training centres. In response, we requested a reduction in the number of children placed at Oakhill to make changes at the centre and to support the management team, appoint a new head of safeguarding, reduce staff attrition and launch a vigorous recruitment campaign.</p> <p>\u201cWhile inspectors acknowledge that the director has a purposeful vision to tackle Oakhill\u2019s challenges and there has been change and improvement during the latter half of 2016, there is still a great deal more to do.\u201d </p> <p>Petherick added that although G4S was committed to the sale of Oakhill, the company remained accountable for the young people in its care and staff would continue to provide support to make improvements.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Supermarket inflation doubled last month as shoppers had to pay more for staples such as butter and tea, underlining expectations that household budgets will come under extra pressure in 2017. Grocery inflation jumped to a near three-year high of 1.4% in the 12 weeks to 26 February, from 0.7% in the 12 weeks to 29 January, according to the consumer consultancy Kantar Worldpanel. The cost of fruit and vegetables \u2013 a large proportion of which are imported \u2013 also rose. Butter prices rose 15.8% over the period, fish prices rose 8.8%, and tea prices were up 6%. The jump in food inflation shows the pace at which the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June is now feeding into consumer prices. A weaker pound makes goods imported from overseas more expensive. The rise in food prices ends a run of falling costs that began in September 2014 as supermarket competition in the sector intensified and companies stepped up price wars. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said that supermarkets including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 the so-called big four \u2013 were now benefiting from rising prices. \u201cWhile consumers may be starting to feel a very slight pinch, increased inflation has led to overall market growth. Simultaneously, combined sales at the UK\u2019s four largest supermarkets increased by 0.5% year on year.\u201d It comes as the OECD warned on Tuesday that rising inflation would hit households in Britain this year, making them less willing to spend money, and holding back economic growth. The Paris-based thinktank expects UK growth to slow in 2017 to 1.6% from 1.8% in 2016. As families grapple with rising prices, wage growth is expected to remain weak, further stretching weekly budgets. The headline rate of inflation measured by the Office for National Statistics is expected to rise to about 3% from a current rate of 1.8% as firms continue to pass on the rising costs of their own raw materials and goods. Kantar pointed out that not all grocery prices rose \u2013 there were falls in a number of items, including crisps, bacon and eggs. The Kantar figures are not the official inflation figures but are based on 75,000 identical products compared year on year in the proportions purchased by shoppers. Overall grocery sales increased by 2.3% in the latest 12-week period, compared with a year earlier. It was the highest rate since June 2014. McKevitt said premium meal deals were popular with supermarket customers over the period. \u201cBritish diners spent \u00a39m more on premium meal deals than during the same period last year, suggesting that celebrating special occasions at home is an increasingly appealing option,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s hard-pressed retailers have urged Philip Hammond to rethink government plans for revamping business rates amid signs that rising inflation has led to the weakest high street spending in more than five years. A report from the British Retail Consortium and KPMG found that the spurt in consumer spending seen in the run-up to Christmas had come to an abrupt halt, with the result that non-food sales are falling for the first time since the economy was flirting with a double-dip recession in November 2011. Further evidence that consumers are becoming more cautious was provided by the the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which released figures on Monday showing a drop of more than 4% in private car sales last month. Some City analysts believe households brought forward purchases of big-ticket items in 2016 because they were fearful that the fall in the value of the pound since last June\u2019s Brexit vote would mean having to pay more for the same goods later. The annual inflation rate as measured by the consumer prices index doubled to 1.8% between October and January. The BRC/KPMG report found that non-food sales were 0.2% lower in the three months to February than in the same period a year earlier and 0.4% lower once allowance had been made for the expansion of retailers\u2019 floorspace over the past year. Supermarkets fared better, with food sales up by 2% in the three months to February despite the impact of the decline in sterling on the cost of imported produce. Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said there had been some distortion caused by the later timing of Mothering Sunday this year, which meant that some categories of spending \u2013 such as women\u2019s accessories and health and beauty \u2013 failed to benefit from the build-up of gift purchases as they did last year. \u201cBut looking beyond this distortion, the persistent weak sales performance of several non-food categories points to an undeniable trend of cautious spending on non-essential items,\u201d she said. \u201cTougher times are expected ahead. The impact of inflation on consumer spending will add further intensity to an already fiercely competitive environment in which the ability to adapt and innovate will be key to survival. Looking to the budget this week, we hope to see a commitment from government to lay a path to a truly sustainable business rates system that will give retailers the flexibility needed to invest and support their local communities.\u201d Online spending held up better than spending in stores, although the pace of growth has eased to 8% from the double-digit increases seen in previous years. Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u201cRetailers will be paying close attention to the upcoming spring budget in the hope of seeing some measures to ease the pressure being placed on margins. For some bricks and mortar retailers, a hike in business rates may well be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.\u201d The SMMT said new car registrations were broady stable in February, with demand down just 0.3% to 83,115 vehicles sold. Rising fleet sales, up 3.3% on a year earlier, masked a 4.4% decline in sales to private buyers. February\u2019s dip followed a stronger performance in January; for the first two months of 2017, total and private sales were 1.8% up on the same months of 2016. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cFebruary is traditionally one of the quietest months of the year and a steady performance was expected following another year of record growth in 2016. We expect to see the market bounce back in March as buyers take advantage of the new 2017 plate, as well as the last chance to buy a car eligible for current lower VED [vehicle excise duty] rates before they change on 1 April.\u201d Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cConsumers are now seeing their purchasing power increasingly diluted and this squeeze looks certain to intensify over the coming months as inflation rises further and earnings growth is muted. Furthermore, a likely weakening economy and more uncertain outlook may well make businesses more circumspect in their car purchases \u2013 perhaps taking longer to replace fleets. \u201cMeanwhile, the sharp weakening of the pound makes it more difficult for car dealers to offer attractive deals on imported cars \u2013 with the result that some car manufacturers have raised prices and more increases seem inevitable during 2017.\u201d",

The annual inflation rate as measured by the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/jan2017\">consumer prices index</a> doubled to 1.8% between October and January.</p> <p>The BRC/KPMG report found that non-food sales were 0.2% lower in the three months to February than in the same period a year earlier and 0.4% lower once allowance had been made for the expansion of retailers\u2019 floorspace over the past year.</p> <p>Supermarkets fared better, with food sales up by 2% in the three months to February despite the impact of the decline in sterling on the cost of imported produce.</p> <p>Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said there had been some distortion caused by the later timing of Mothering Sunday this year, which meant that some categories of spending \u2013 such as women\u2019s accessories and health and beauty \u2013 failed to benefit from the build-up of gift purchases as they did last year.</p> <p>\u201cBut looking beyond this distortion, the persistent weak sales performance of several non-food categories points to an undeniable trend of cautious spending on non-essential items,\u201d she said. <br></p> <p>\u201cTougher times are expected ahead. The impact of inflation on consumer spending will add further intensity to an already fiercely competitive environment in which the ability to adapt and innovate will be key to survival. Looking to the budget this week, we hope to see a commitment from government to lay a path to a truly sustainable business rates system that will give retailers the flexibility needed to invest and support their local communities.\u201d</p> <p>Online spending held up better than spending in stores, although the pace of growth has eased to 8% from the double-digit increases seen in previous years.</p> <p>Paul Martin, the UK head of retail at KPMG, said: \u201cRetailers will be paying close attention to the upcoming spring budget in the hope of seeing some measures to ease the pressure being placed on margins. For some bricks and mortar retailers, a hike in business rates may well be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.\u201d<br></p> <p>The SMMT said new car registrations were broady stable in February, with demand down just 0.3% to 83,115 vehicles sold. Rising fleet sales, up 3.3% on a year earlier, masked a 4.4% decline in sales to private buyers.</p> <p>February\u2019s dip followed a stronger performance in January; for the first two months of 2017, total and private sales were 1.8% up on the same months of 2016.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cFebruary is traditionally one of the quietest months of the year and a steady performance was expected following another year of record growth in 2016. We expect to see the market bounce back in March as buyers take advantage of the new 2017 plate, as well as the last chance to buy a car eligible for current lower VED [vehicle excise duty] rates before they change on 1 April.\u201d<br></p> <p>Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \u201cConsumers are now seeing their purchasing power increasingly diluted and this squeeze looks certain to intensify over the coming months as inflation rises further and earnings growth is muted. Furthermore, a likely weakening economy and more uncertain outlook may well make businesses more circumspect in their car purchases \u2013 perhaps taking longer to replace fleets. </p> <p>\u201cMeanwhile, the sharp weakening of the pound makes it more difficult for car dealers to offer attractive deals on imported cars \u2013 with the result that some car manufacturers have raised prices and more increases seem inevitable during 2017.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the night of his 30th birthday, after a few drinks, Dean Karnazes decided that he would celebrate by running all the way from San Francisco down the coast to the town of Half Moon Bay, a distance of 30 miles. So began a career as an endurance runner. He has run 50 marathons in 50 consecutive days in all 50 states, and taken part in such extreme competitions as a marathon to the South Pole and a 135-mile race through Death Valley, one of the hottest places on Earth. Karnazes once ran 350 miles in 81 hours and 44 minutes, without stopping to sleep. His account of his feats of distance running, Ultramarathon Man, is a bestseller. Karnazes\u2019s superhuman exertions are sponsored by The North Face, the company that make the kit he wears in his coaching videos. The North Face, a Bay Area-based outdoor clothing manufacturer, sells garments and gear for climbing, backpacking, running, and skiing. Its stores are decorated with huge photographs of people climbing icy peaks and running through meadows. Central to the brand\u2019s ethos are the professional athletes it sponsors, people not widely known but celebrated in their fields \u2013 names such as Karnazes and Pete Athans, who has climbed Everest seven times. The North Face sells the idea of adventure \u2013 of pushing limits \u2013 whether running long distances, climbing an untried rockface, or sleeping outside at sub-zero temperatures. Its tagline is \u201cnever stop exploring\u201d. (\u201cWe have actually been approached with partnerships about spacesuits to Mars and things like that,\u201d one publicist told me recently.) This canny marketing of adventure has made The North Face the dominant player in a booming outdoor-wear market \u2013 a $4bn industry in the US alone. And its closest rival in the contest to sell the thrill of the wilderness to the masses may be a company whose origins and history are tightly intertwined with its own: Patagonia. If The North Face aims to appeal to the overachieving weekend warrior, Patagonia is for the slightly more mellow soul who wants to soak up the fresh air and enjoy the view as he ascends a craggy mountain. The company\u2019s ethos is encapsulated in Let My People Go Surfing, the memoir-cum-management classic about Patagonia, by the company\u2019s founder Yvon Chouinard \u2013 reissued last year in a 10th-anniversary edition, with a new introduction by Naomi Klein. The book contains lavish colour pictures of people in genial communion with nature. To browse the book is to dive into a world of life-affirming outdoor feats followed by nights around the fire, swapping heroic tales. Unlike other billion-dollar sports brands, neither company sells balls or bats. They do not cater to team sports. They are, above all, selling the allure of the great outdoors, offering their customers technically advanced gear for going off into the wilds with a friend or two. (Or, if you prefer, alone: the cover of the winter 2016 Patagonia catalogue features a man on a motorbike \u2013 carrying a pair of skis under one arm \u2013 smiling at a squirrel as it crosses the road.) Both companies understand that the appeal of endurance sports has something to do with acquiring kit that boasts the most advanced technology. For genuine adventure, their marketing implies, you need top-quality gear. And top-quality gear designed to withstand the harshest conditions and last a lifetime does not come cheap. You can buy an Inferno sleeping bag from The North Face that will, for $729 (\u00a3593), keep you warm in temperatures as cold as -40C. For $529 (\u00a3430), you can get a neoprene-free, natural rubber, hooded wetsuit from Patagonia for use in water temperatures down to 0C. Both companies also understand that the largest market for their products is not explorers stocking up for Arctic expeditions. The real money comes from selling products designed for hardcore outdoor adventure to urban customers who lead relatively unadventurous lives. For the most part, people wear North Face and Patagonia gear while doing everyday things: cycling, shopping, walking the dog. \u201cYou can take a backpack to school but you feel like you\u2019re in Yosemite just because it says North Face,\u201d Dean Karnazes told me one afternoon in San Francisco. \u201cI think that aspirational element is really big.\u201d It\u2019s a sales pitch that has yielded big profits. The North Face reported annual revenue of $2.3bn last year, with 200 stores around the world. Patagonia is smaller, but growing more rapidly. The company had sales of $800m in 2016, twice as much as in 2010, and has 29 standalone stores in the US, 23 in Japan, and others in locations such as Chamonix, the French ski resort. While The North Face sells $5,500 (\u00a34,480) two-metre tents and Patagonia sells $629 waders for fly fishing, many of the most popular products for both companies are everyday wear: waterproof anoraks, leggings, fleeces, and, most important of all, puffer jackets. \u201cEveryone is trying to reinvent and reinterpret the black puffy jacket,\u201d said Jeff Crook, the chief product officer at Mountain Equipment Co-Op, an outdoor department store that has 20 stores across Canada, \u201cwhether it spends most of its time on the mountain peak or at the bus stop.\u201d The flagship jackets for both companies are the product of decades of technological refinement to make them increasingly warm, durable, and light. The most advanced models today have been engineered to solve the problem of how to insulate the wearer against cold and wet while remaining \u201cbreathable\u201d \u2013 so you don\u2019t overheat while you\u2019re scaling that cliff face. At Patagonia, there is the Nano-Air ($249; \u00a3180 in the UK), a quilted, but not very puffy, water resistant jacket that uses a trademarked synthetic insulation that the company described as \u201crevolutionary\u201d upon its release in 2014. The North Face Thermoball ($199; \u00a3150) has its own proprietary synthetic insulation, which uses clusters of fibre to trap heat in a manner that mimics down. Both jackets are fit for a mountaineering expedition, but are each more likely to be bought to keep warm while taking the kids to the park. Neither company regards the other as a rival \u2013 at least not publicly. But aside from the fact they sell the same kind of stuff to the same kind of customers (urban, affluent), the two companies have quite a bit of shared history. Doug Tompkins, co-founder of The North Face, and Yvon Chouinard were lifelong friends and brothers in adventure. Both men started out making their own specialist equipment; both went on to found companies selling outdoor wear; both felt distinctly uncomfortable doing office jobs, and still more uncomfortable running companies. \u201cI\u2019ve been a businessman for almost 60 years,\u201d Chouinard writes in the introduction to Let My People Go Surfing. \u201cIt\u2019s as difficult for me to say those words as it is for someone to admit being an alcoholic or lawyer.\u201d And together, while promoting the glories of exploring the unspoiled wilderness, both men have been central to the mass popularisation of outdoor activities such as hiking and climbing, which may, in turn, make nature a little less unspoiled. Selling professional-grade gear to people with no intention of using it professionally isn\u2019t exactly a new trick in marketing, as the makers of SUVs, digital cameras and headphones can tell you. Most people who buy the Nike trainers advertised by Mo Farah don\u2019t use them to run long distances. But North Face and Patagonia are both wrestling with a more consequential paradox, one that is central to contemporary consumerism: we want to feel morally good about the things we buy. And both companies have been phenomenally successful because they have crafted an image that is about more than just being ethical and environmentally friendly, but about nature, adventure, exploration \u2013 ideas more grandiose than simply selling you a jacket, taking your money and trying not to harm the earth too much along the way. But the paradox is that by presenting themselves this way, they are selling a lot more jackets. In other words, both companies are selling stuff in part by looking like they\u2019re not trying too hard to sell stuff, which helps them sell more stuff \u2013 and fills the world with more and more stuff. You might call this the authenticity problem. And for all their similarities, the two companies are taking radically different approaches to solving it. * * * Doug Tompkins and Yvon Choiunard were the kind of outcast adolescents who found a home in the great outdoors. Both men became passionate about climbing and surfing in the American west in the middle of the last century. Back in the 1950s and 60s, climbing was \u201can unusual sport with just a small group of renegades who were, you know, misfits\u201d, said Rick Ridgeway, an accomplished mountaineer and adventurer. (Rolling Stone magazine once called him \u201cThe Real Indiana Jones.\u201d) An old friend of both Tompkins and Choiunard, he is now vice president for public engagement at Patagonia. Both The North Face and Patagonia have their roots in exploring the sort of remote places about which guidebooks had not been written. In those days, getting back to uncorrupted nature and reading Thoreau by the campfire slotted in well with the nascent counterculture. \u201cWe took special pride in the fact that climbing rocks and icefalls had no economic value in society,\u201d Chouinard wrote in Let My People Go Surfing. Tompkins opened the first The North Face retail store selling mountaineering equipment in the North Beach neighbourhood of San Francisco in 1966. The Grateful Dead played at the opening, and there was a fashion show featuring Joan Baez and her sister, the late singer and activist Mimi Fari\u00f1a. In Southern California, Chouinard, who was among the pioneers of what has since become known as the \u201cgolden age of Yosemite climbing\u201d, had begun making his own equipment in the late 1950s. At first, he created and forged reusable steel pitons that were hammered into rock faces and then removed. Then, to help preserve climbing routes from disfigurement, Chouinard changed to aluminium chocks that could be wedged in by hand and did not leave a trace behind. The ambition at the time was to do as little damage as possible \u2013 as the Sierra climber Doug Robinson put it: \u201cOrganic climbing for the natural man.\u201d The two men met in the mid-60s when Tompkins began to distribute Chouinard\u2019s equipment through The North Face. Early in their friendship, a white-water kayaking trip together in California ended with Chouinard getting 15 stitches in his face. And in 1968 the two drove a Ford Econoline van from Ventura, California, to the remote region of Chile and Argentina named Patagonia. That same year, Tompkins sold his stake in The North Face for $50,000, and with his then wife, Susie, founded the San Francisco-based casualwear brand Esprit, whose hip version of sportswear became synonymous with 1980s style. After reading Bill Devall\u2019s environmental call to arms Deep Ecology: Living as if Nature Mattered in the 1980s, Tompkins decided to leave the apparel business and devote himself full time to saving the environment. By the time Esprit was sold in 1990, its annual sales were estimated to be $1bn. Chouinard had also branched out from mountaineering equipment. He had begun to import climbing wear, for sale, and in 1973, founded a new company named Patagonia. One of his earliest employees was Kris McDivitt, a downhill ski-racer. She became general manager and then CEO of Patagonia, before she met Doug Tompkins, who was then divorced.They married in 1993, a union of sorts between the two companies. Together the couple eventually bought 2.2m acres in Patagonia to conserve and live on full-time. They planned to protect this tract of wilderness, using the fortune he made from fuelling people\u2019s ambitions to explore the outdoors. * * * If Tompkins\u2019s response to his dawning realisation that the apparel industry was damaging the environment was to sell his business and take direct action to save the Earth, then Chouinard, by contrast, decided to keep his company in private hands and run it in a way that might minimise environmental damage \u2013 a nearly impossible task that seems to weigh very heavily on him. \u201cEvil always wins if we do nothing,\u201d he writes in Let My People Go Surfing. The challenge of taking the moral high ground while still making and selling things is something that Rick Ridgeway also thinks about a great deal. \u201cOur mission is to build the best product, causing no unnecessary harm, then that second part of our mission is essentially saying that we\u2019ve got to do less bad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make our product with the smallest footprint possible, but it is a footprint.\u201d For both men \u2013 who would not disagree with the radical environmentalist Edward Abbey\u2019s famous remark that \u201cgrowth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell\u201d \u2013 running an ethical business is an almost impossible challenge, if not a contradiction. Populating the world with more stuff that will eventually get thrown away is bad for the planet; the popularising of outdoor culture of all sorts is bad for specific places of natural beauty, which risk being overrun with people; and finally \u2013 and most difficult \u2013 the entire ethos of growth and profit and consumption is unsustainable for humanity and the health of the planet. Jill Dumain, the director of environment strategy, who has been at Patagonia for more than 27 years, can easily list all the ways the company is trying to do the right thing, among them the decision, in the 1990s, to use only organic cotton, and in 2013 to switch to torture-free goose down. (The North Face made the same move in 2014.) It has tried to replace as many of its synthetic materials as possible with recycled ones, although finding recycled zippers and buttons has been a struggle. Socially, it is committed to fair trade in its supply chain, in the mills and sewing factories it works with. This has led to the company splitting up with suppliers who were not willing or able to make the changes it demanded. These are the sorts of problems that Patagonia has chosen to explore to an almost obsessive degree. The idea of businesses being \u201ctransparent\u201d is wholly overused but, in Patagonia\u2019s case, it is fitting. Over time, Chouinard and Ridgeway matured into their roles as aging renegades: they appear as delightfully cranky old friends in a 2010 documentary, 180 Degrees South: Conquerors of the Useless, which follows a young writer and photographer as he attempts to retrace their now-legendary 1968 trip from California to Chile. Their adventures continued into December of 2015, when Chouinard, Ridgeway, Tompkins, and three other friends went on a seemingly gentle five-day kayaking trip to southern Chile. Ridgeway, who is 67, and Tompkins, 72, shared a kayak and it capsized in heavy waves in 4C water. The six men were rescued via patrol boat and helicopter but Tompkins suffered from severe hypothermia. He died in a hospital that night. \u201cDoug had a visceral dislike for authority and always relished breaking the rules,\u201d Chouinard wrote. It was a heartfelt tribute to his old friend. In his book, Chouinard comes off as a grumpy, seasoned old-timer, constantly bemoaning the lack of credibility in everyone, everywhere. \u201cYvon calls himself the biggest pessimist in the world,\u201d says Dumain. Chouinard and his wife Malinda divide their time between Ventura and their long-time home in Jackson Hole, a mountain resort town in Wyoming now known as a playground for the super-rich \u2013 Harrison Ford, Sandra Bullock and Dick Cheney all have homes there. Patagonia employees talk about Chouinard with the devotion usually reserved for cult leaders, but with a tone that suggests that they also view him as a somewhat mercurial genius. \u201cHe spends a lot of time outdoors like he always has,\u201d says Rose Marcario, Patagonia\u2019s CEO, \u201ca lot of time fishing, or teaching kids how to fish.\u201d When I called, he was always off somewhere; no one seemed to know quite where. By keeping Patagonia as a privately owned business, Chouinard has been able to run it in a way that stays true to his values. (Patagonia is organised as a for-profit company, known as a B-Corp, with certification for its social and environmental commitment.) \u201cWhen the company becomes the fatted calf, it\u2019s sold for a profit, and its resources and holdings are often ravaged and broken apart, leading to the disruption of family ties and the long-term health of local economies,\u201d he writes in Let My People Go Surfing. \u201cWhen you get away from the idea that a company is a product to be sold to the highest bidder in the shortest amount of time, all future decisions in the company are affected.\u201d Patagonia\u2019s competitors, The North Face included, are mostly public companies driven by shareholders. \u201cThe mission and the values of Patagonia have never been really about that,\u201d says Marcario. \u201cThey\u2019ve been about how much influence we can have on preserving and conserving the wild places that we love and play in, and how much influence we can have as a business to help change the model.\u201d But, while Tompkins left business altogether to save the wilderness, Chouinard seems like a man who will never stop being conflicted about what running a successful business entails. \u201cPatagonia will never be completely socially responsible,\u201d he has written. \u201cIt will never make a totally sustainable non-damaging product. But it is committed to trying.\u201d * * * Patagonia\u2019s headquarters are in Ventura, a small beach town in Southern California in between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. The buildings occupy a 5.5-acre campus and are painted in a signature buttery ochre colour used in most of the Patagonia retail stores around the world. There\u2019s a large playground for the onsite creche \u2013 an employee benefit so rare in the US that Patagonia published a book last summer about its child-friendly philosophy. The company prides itself in hiring relatively few people but looking after them all. There is something about being on the Patagonia campus that feels like being in a Scandinavian country \u2013 albeit one with banana plants, blooming agaves and jacaranda trees. There are solar panels, piles of surfboards for employees to use, and a car with a licence plate that reads BUMKIN. Offices have bean bags and stability balls to sit on, and the canteen serves organic kale blackberry salad. Then there\u2019s the shed that originally housed Chouinard\u2019s blacksmithing workshop, where he made climbing gear. It now feels a bit like a museum piece, frozen in the 1970s, but apparently Chouinard still tinkers around in it from time to time. The campus is the setting for many ostentatious efforts to do good. \u201cOne day I was walking down the steps and there were pieces of paper all over the sidewalks, and they all had arrows [on them] and said, \u2018Careful. Watch out. Butterfly chrysalis,\u2019\u201d Dean Carter, the vice president of human resources, told me. If this conspicuous altruism is grating to some people, they do not work at Patagonia. Still, the company says that it does not only recruit environmentally conscious do-gooders. \u201cIf we picked people who fit a specific mould, it could feel really culty,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBut we\u2019re just looking for threads; we\u2019re not looking for the entire quilt. We\u2019re looking for threads of caring for the environment, threads of caring about the outdoors, and threads of caring about families, collaborating, working.\u201d In a not-necessarily-cultish way, a lot of Patagonia employees go on to marry other Patagonia employees, and family members often work there too. Carter\u2019s own daughter is a receptionist. Companies wishing to improve their public image drop by to see if a little ethical stardust will rub off on them. Coca-Cola flew in a team from South Africa. There was even a visit from Chick-Fil-A, the US fast food chain famous for taking a public stance against same-sex marriage in 2012. I registered my surprise. \u201cExactly! And I have a partner. So they asked me if they could come. I was kind of like, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019\u201d Carter says. \u201cAnd obviously we don\u2019t share their values. But they have their very specific culture that they\u2019re living. And they were really sweet and kind.\u201d When Neil Blumenthal, co-founder of the fashionable eyewear startup Warby Parker, came to visit, he was impressed by how much work went into research and development \u2013 he mentioned the way Patagonia tests its raincoats with waters of various alkalinity to mimic rain in different parts of the world. But what really struck him, he said, was the venue for his meeting with two Patagonia executives: \u201cInstead of taking the meeting in a conference room, we took a walk to the beach. For me it was pretty special; for them it was quite ordinary.\u201d Ridgeway \u2013 whose job as vice president of public engagement is to represent the company, whether at conferences or universities, or to executives who come to the Ventura headquarters \u2013 described the process of meeting visitors: \u201cThey go on a tour, we walk around and talk about the values and how we live the values. Usually we get some local organically grown food and we answer questions and share a story,\u201d Ridgeway told me. \u201cAnd then we are curious what their story is.\u201d Ridgeway can sometimes sound a little weary at having to explain to outsiders a way of life that comes quite naturally to him. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hold ourselves up in some arrogant exclusivity,\u201d Ridgeway said, but then described the kind of customer that Patagonia does not \u201cnecessarily want to invite under our umbrella\u201d. Namely, people who want to climb Mount Everest for bragging rights \u2013 the sort of affluent adventurers, drawn to climbing in part by Patagonia, whose impact Chouinard now regrets so much. \u201cSomeone who has paid $100,000 for a guided climb where the sherpas put the route in and risked their lives fixing the lines and carried all your stuff up for you and positioned your oxygen balls so you could go up and come back and say you climbed Everest. That doesn\u2019t work for us,\u201d Ridgeway says. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t mind saying it publicly.\u201d In its pursuit of authenticity, Patagonia tries to avoid malls, and only takes over spaces that mean something to the community. (One of its four Manhattan stores is located on the Bowery, next to the former location of the punk club CBGB, which is now a John Varvatos boutique.) It prides itself on pushing up against the limits of how ethical a company can be while actually still selling things: quality goods, ethical labour and manufacturing, no debt, even a tax strategy, according to Chouinard\u2019s book, \u201cto pay our fair share and not a penny more\u201d. The company is hyper-aware of these contradictions, perhaps to the point of tying itself in knots. In 2011, on Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year in the US, Patagonia ran an ad featuring a photo of a plush blue fleece, and copy that read DON\u2019T BUY THIS JACKET. The advert invited customers to make a commitment to reduce what they buy, repair their gear and recycle the stuff they no longer need. (Patagonia\u2019s campus in Reno, Nevada houses the largest garment repair facility in North America.) But it had the opposite effect: Patagonia\u2019s Black Friday sales increased by 30% over the previous year. The anti-sales message, as they might have expected, made consumers feel better about buying more. The company\u2019s attempts to expand into new markets have a similar blend of moral commitment and financial savvy. In 2013, it launched a venture fund to invest in environmentally and socially responsible for-profit startups. In 2012, the company launched a food line named Patagonia Provisions, which includes buffalo jerky, smoked wild Sockeye salmon and, beginning last October, a beer made with a grain called kernza, which can be grown year-round. The target market is \u201cconcerned moms that want to make sure they\u2019re giving their kids organic, non-GMO food\u201d, Rose Marcario told me. The new food division, she added, has won the company \u201ca whole new set of customers\u201d. * * * At the headquarters of The North Face in Alameda \u2013 just across the bay from San Francisco \u2013 there is a similar preoccupation with being green and avoiding waste. During a visit last summer, I had a lunch of sustainably raised salmon with Todd Spaletto, who became president of the company in 2011. The building where we dined was insulated with recycled blue jeans, and there were composting bins, solar panels and free charging stations for electric cars. One building housed a vast area dedicated to repairing clothes under the company\u2019s lifetime warranty. As we ate, a team out on the lawn was testing out the set-up of a large, complicated-looking hexagonal tent. A visitor to The North Face campus encounters the same sporty feel as at Patagonia HQ \u2013 but instead of Patagonia\u2019s crunchy \u201csoul surfer\u201d vibe, here there is an edge of elite athleticism, whether in the form of employees doing bootcamp workouts and agility drills in the well-equipped gym, or a casual mention that Dean Karnazes was there just the other day, leading a group run along the water. \u201cOne of my first weeks on the job, I was talking to somebody and they were like, \u2018What are you doing this weekend?\u2019\u201d Spaletto recalled, smiling. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m pretty excited, I\u2019m running a half-marathon.\u2019 And they were like\u201d \u2013 and here he adopted a tone reserved for motivating small children \u2013 \u201c\u2018That\u2019s great, you gotta start somewhere!\u2019\u201d Lately The North Face has been focusing more and more on a younger, casual customer whose main interest in hiking is the part where they get to drink beer around a campfire. \u201cWhy does the youthful millennial consumer go outdoors?\u201d Spaletto asked. \u201cThey value one thing above all else. It\u2019s this whole idea of these genuine experiential moments that you share with your friends.\u201d These youthful consumers may even decide they can afford to skip the hike and go straight to the beer. But as The North Face positions itself as a fashion brand as much as an outdoor wear company, a new dilemma arises. The casual customer is drawn both to style and to the authenticity of owning real technical gear \u2013 but if the gear itself announces its technical utility too loudly, it ceases to be fashionable. \u201cThe outdoor industry has prided itself on showing the technology on the outside \u2013 seams sealed, zippers taped. That is very much core to this industry, everybody does it,\u201d said Sumie Scott, the senior product director for \u201cmountain culture\u201d at The North Face. \u201cBut the more youthful consumer wants hidden technology. So that\u2019s the challenge, how do you get them to know that technology exists?\u201d \u201cWhat The North Face tries to push is this high, high performance extremity,\u201d said Cathy Begien, who worked in visual merchandising at The North Face a decade ago, and has since gone on to work at Prada, Opening Ceremony, and Warby Parker. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Cathy use Everest imagery or rock climbing.\u2019 But I\u2019m in a mall and people are pushing strollers around at 8am. I don\u2019t think they care about whether an alpinist would want this, or an ultra-marathoner,\u201d Begien recalled. \u201cHoliday season was the only time I didn\u2019t have to talk about mountain climbing or water rafting and could just show a bunch of jackets in a way the typical mall consumer can understand: this one is gonna keep you warm, this one is gonna keep you warmer, this one is gonna keep you warmest.\u201d The high cost of North Face gear creates high expectations: \u201cYou get a fairly affluent customer who expects meticulous service. You have to behave as though you\u2019re working at a Vuitton or a Gucci,\u201d said Caitlin Kelly, a journalist who took a job at a North Face outlet in suburban New York after losing her reporting job during the 2008 recession, and wrote a book, titled Malled, about the experience. \u201cIt was a long, narrow store. And when you walked in, half the store was fashion, half was \u2018Let\u2019s climb Everest\u2019. It was massively confusing to the shopper.\u201d The North Face wants to do style and adventure. It has collaborated on slippers and puffer jackets with Supreme, the skateboarding brand with a cult following. (Drake wore a jacket from the collection in the video for his 2011 single The Motto.) The trend among makers of serious technical gear is for designs that don\u2019t look like you are about to climb to Camp 4 on Everest \u2013 while at the same time, couture designers are increasingly showing items inspired by authentic outdoor gear. Patrik Ervell, Steven Alan and Louis Vuitton have all designed fleece jackets that appear to be a riff on Patagonia\u2019s Retro-X; puffer jackets have started to appear on the covers of fashion magazines, thanks in part to Balenciaga\u2019s $3,000 parkas. The desire to broadcast a sense of adventure while still looking good may have something to do with the biggest trend in athletic gear in recent years: the rise of \u201cathleisure\u201d \u2013 clothes that suggest, rather than insist on, performance, designed to transition from workout to sofa. Leggings \u2013 whether made by The Gap or Alexander Wang \u2013 are the most popular form of sporting loungewear (or is it lounging sportswear), having replaced denim as the preferred casual wear for women. The UK sportswear market will surpass \u00a38bn by 2020, fuelled by the rise of athleisure. In addition to gear for high-altitude camping and open-water diving, both The North Face and Patagonia sell leggings and sweatpants and T-shirts and all manner of gear best suited for hanging out. But for The North Face, exercising feels like an urban moral imperative, much as recycling does at Patagonia \u2013 a duty to care for oneself in tandem with caring about nature. While The North Face nominally shares the same ethos as Patagonia in terms of protecting the planet, its status as a publicly traded company means it has to maximise profits, which goes with the company\u2019s type-A branding \u2013 you are not going to see any North Face slow-growth manifestos or \u201cDon\u2019t Buy This Jacket\u201d ads. In fact, after The North Face announced in October that its third-quarter revenue had dropped 1%, Spaletto, my summer lunch companion, quietly departed the company. If the risk for Patagonia is to be seen just like any other company \u2013 one that cares as much about profits as the environment \u2013 then the comparable risk for The North Face is to be associated with suburban parents and college students whose greatest trek is across the quad, rather than trailrunners, mountain climbers and the occasional well-dressed rapper. It has to remain authentic enough to represent authenticity for the casual customer, without being so authentic that those people stop buying. * * * \u201cNorth Face has the misfortune of being east-coast prep-school girls wearing black puffers and Uggs,\u201d says Matt Langer \u2013 a cyclist, New Mexico resident and Patagonia customer. He\u2019s a friend of a friend whose Instagram looks like a real-life recreation of the Patagonia catalogue, complete with fly-fishing, long-distance mountain biking, an adorable dog and waterfalls. Patagonia\u2019s marketing is spot on, he says, a bit sheepishly. \u201cI am a bearded white guy drinking beer around the campfire.\u201d For the committed outdoorsman \u2013 who styles himself a rugged individualist, untouched by the whims of fashion \u2013 there\u2019s an ambivalence at being so accurately cast. That stereotype, says Josh Contois, who I met on a group hiking trip in California last year, \u201cis to be a dirtbag and live frugally and also wear a $250 jacket\u201d. (Outside Magazine once called Chouinard \u201cKing of the Dirtbags\u201d.) Both Contois and Langer wear Patagonia in a way that would make Chouinard smile, even though much of their actual equipment comes from niche brands. For the real dirtbag, who now regards The North Face somewhat like McDonald\u2019s or Wal-Mart, even Patagonia has mostly sold out to the urban yuppie. The true adventurer instead buys even more expensive, precious, and specialised gear \u2013 from tiny companies owned and operated by fellow mountaineers in outdoor meccas such as Boulder, Colorado or Bend, Oregon. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, Patagonia appeals to \u2013 I don\u2019t want to sound like a smartass \u2013 but people driving Range Rovers who shop at Whole Foods,\u201d said Doug Heinrich, an executive at the Utah-based Black Diamond Equipment \u2013 Chouinard\u2019s original climbing equipment company, which was renamed after he sold it to an employee in the 1980s. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t appeal to core climbers, but we\u2019re going to appeal to that hardcore climber more than Patagonia would.\u201d On the other end of the spectrum, there is another crop of companies who appeal to the super-rich (or design fetishists) by trying to out-fancy Patagonia and The North Face on both technical sophistication and price. The small Canadian brand Arc\u2019teryx produces a high-end line called Veilance, which promises \u201cminimalist style with total performance\u201d, and looks as if Prada made high-tech outdoor gear, with prices to match. Canada Goose, whose \u201cArctic luxury apparel\u201d is worn by scientists at the South Pole, offers a \u201cKensington\u201d Parka priced at \u00a3850. There is something undeniably alluring about the lengthy descriptions of the technical merits of all this cutting-edge gear: the insulation that traps air for reduced heat loss and increased warmth, the underarm vents, the wrist accessory pocket, the reminder that your jacket is coming with a lifetime warranty, even if it isn\u2019t destined to leave the borough of Manhattan. That, after all, was always the bedrock of high fashion \u2013 people justified the prices of a cashmere sweater or a leather jacket because what they bought was well made, beautifully crafted, and lasted for ever. This may be what appeals to such customers as the man who recently came into the San Francisco North Face store and bought a Himalayan suit, which is filled with goose down and costs $1,000. The sales copy describes the item thus: \u201cTechnical, insulated full-body suit for climbing 8,000-metre peaks, the Himalayan Suit is a necessity for athletes aiming to reach the top of the world.\u201d It looks like a yellow and black sleeping bag with arms and legs and, according to the catalogue, includes \u201ccritical features based on Conrad Anker\u2019s feedback and proven on Mount Everest, where the athlete team successfully reached summit\u201d. The staff at The North Face store asked the customer where he was planning on going with his Himalayan suit. Nowhere, he said. He was just buying it because it was cool. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 March 2017.

      "body": "<p>On the night of his 30th birthday, after a few drinks, Dean Karnazes decided that he would celebrate by running all the way from San Francisco down the coast to the town of Half Moon Bay, a distance of 30 miles. So began a career as an endurance runner. He has run 50 marathons in 50 consecutive days in all 50 states, and taken part in such extreme competitions as a marathon to the South Pole and a 135-mile race through Death Valley, one of the hottest places on Earth. Karnazes once ran 350 miles in 81 hours and 44 minutes, without stopping to sleep. His account of his feats of distance running, Ultramarathon Man, is a bestseller. Karnazes\u2019s superhuman exertions are sponsored by The North Face, the company that make the kit he wears in his coaching videos.</p> <p>The North Face, a Bay Area-based outdoor clothing manufacturer, sells garments and gear for climbing, backpacking, running, and skiing. Its stores are decorated with huge photographs of people climbing icy peaks and running through meadows. Central to the brand\u2019s ethos are the professional athletes it sponsors, people not widely known but celebrated in their fields \u2013 names such as Karnazes and Pete Athans, who has climbed Everest seven times. The North Face sells the idea of adventure \u2013 of pushing limits \u2013 whether running long distances, climbing an untried rockface, or sleeping outside at sub-zero temperatures. Its tagline is \u201cnever stop exploring\u201d. (\u201cWe have actually been approached with partnerships about spacesuits to Mars and things like that,\u201d one publicist told me recently.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/oct/01/wild-quiz-how-extreme-are-you\">How extreme is your life? Take the test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This canny marketing of adventure has made The North Face the dominant player in a booming outdoor-wear market \u2013 a $4bn industry in the US alone. And its closest rival in the contest to sell the thrill of the wilderness to the masses may be a company whose origins and history are tightly intertwined with its own: Patagonia.</p> <p>If The North Face aims to appeal to the overachieving weekend warrior, Patagonia is for the slightly more mellow soul who wants to soak up the fresh air and enjoy the view as he ascends a craggy mountain. The company\u2019s ethos is encapsulated in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/feb/25/ethicalliving.theobserver\">Let My People Go Surfing</a>, the memoir-cum-management classic about Patagonia, by the company\u2019s founder Yvon Chouinard \u2013 reissued last year in a 10th-anniversary edition, with a new introduction by Naomi Klein. The book contains lavish colour pictures of people in genial communion with nature. To browse the book is to dive into a world of life-affirming outdoor feats followed by nights around the fire, swapping heroic tales.</p> <p>Unlike other billion-dollar sports brands, neither company sells balls or bats. They do not cater to team sports. They are, above all, selling the allure of the great outdoors, offering their customers technically advanced gear for going off into the wilds with a friend or two. (Or, if you prefer, alone: the cover of the winter 2016 Patagonia catalogue features a man on a motorbike \u2013 carrying a pair of skis under one arm \u2013 smiling at a squirrel as it crosses the road.)</p> <p>Both companies understand that the appeal of endurance sports has something to do with acquiring kit that boasts the most advanced technology. For genuine adventure, their marketing implies, you need top-quality gear. And top-quality gear designed to withstand the harshest conditions and last a lifetime does not come cheap. You can buy an Inferno sleeping bag from The North Face that will, for $729 (\u00a3593), keep you warm in temperatures as cold as -40C. For $529 (\u00a3430), you can get a neoprene-free, natural rubber, hooded wetsuit from Patagonia for use in water temperatures down to 0C.</p> <p>Both companies also understand that the largest market for their products is not explorers stocking up for Arctic expeditions. The real money comes from selling products designed for hardcore outdoor adventure to urban customers who lead relatively unadventurous lives. For the most part, people wear North Face and Patagonia gear while doing everyday things: cycling, shopping, walking the dog. \u201cYou can take a backpack to school but you feel like you\u2019re in Yosemite just because it says North Face,\u201d Dean Karnazes told me one afternoon in San Francisco. \u201cI think that aspirational element is really big.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a sales pitch that has yielded big profits. The North Face reported annual revenue of $2.3bn last year, with 200 stores around the world. Patagonia is smaller, but growing more rapidly. The company had sales of $800m in 2016, twice as much as in 2010, and has 29 standalone stores in the US, 23 in Japan, and others in locations such as Chamonix, the French ski resort.</p> <p>While The North Face sells $5,500 (\u00a34,480) two-metre tents and Patagonia sells $629 waders for fly fishing, many of the most popular products for both companies are everyday wear: waterproof anoraks, leggings, fleeces, and, most important of all, puffer jackets. \u201cEveryone is trying to reinvent and reinterpret the black puffy jacket,\u201d said Jeff Crook, the chief product officer at Mountain Equipment Co-Op, an outdoor department store that has 20 stores across Canada, \u201cwhether it spends most of its time on the mountain peak or at the bus stop.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Doug Tompkins, co-founder of The North Face, and Yvon Chouinard were lifelong friends and brothers in adventure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The flagship jackets for both companies are the product of decades of technological refinement to make them increasingly warm, durable, and light. The most advanced models today have been engineered to solve the problem of how to insulate the wearer against cold and wet while remaining \u201cbreathable\u201d<strong> </strong>\u2013 so you don\u2019t overheat while you\u2019re scaling that cliff face. At Patagonia, there is the Nano-Air ($249; \u00a3180 in the UK), a quilted, but not very puffy, water resistant jacket that uses a trademarked synthetic insulation that the company described as \u201crevolutionary\u201d upon its release in 2014. The North Face Thermoball ($199; \u00a3150) has its own proprietary synthetic insulation, which uses clusters of fibre to trap heat in a manner that mimics down. Both jackets are fit for a mountaineering expedition, but are each more likely to be bought to keep warm while taking the kids to the park.</p> <p>Neither company regards the other as a rival \u2013 at least not publicly. But aside from the fact they sell the same kind of stuff to the same kind of customers (urban, affluent), the two companies have quite a bit of shared history. Doug Tompkins, co-founder of The North Face, and Yvon Chouinard were lifelong friends and brothers in adventure. Both men started out making their own specialist equipment; both went on to found companies selling outdoor wear; both felt distinctly uncomfortable doing office jobs, and still more uncomfortable running companies.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been a businessman for almost 60 years,\u201d Chouinard writes in the introduction to Let My People Go Surfing. \u201cIt\u2019s as difficult for me to say those words as it is for someone to admit being an alcoholic or lawyer.\u201d And together, while promoting the glories of exploring the unspoiled wilderness, both men have been central to the mass popularisation of outdoor activities such as hiking and climbing, which may, in turn, make nature a little less unspoiled.</p> <p>Selling professional-grade gear to people with no intention of using it professionally isn\u2019t exactly a new trick in marketing, as the makers of SUVs, digital cameras and headphones can tell you. Most people who buy the Nike trainers advertised by Mo Farah don\u2019t use them to run long distances.</p> <p>But North Face and Patagonia are both wrestling with a more consequential paradox, one that is central to contemporary consumerism: we want to feel morally good about the things we buy. And both companies have been phenomenally successful because they have crafted an image that is about more than just being ethical and environmentally friendly, but about nature, adventure, exploration \u2013 ideas more grandiose than simply selling you a jacket, taking your money and trying not to harm the earth too much along the way. But the paradox is that by presenting themselves this way, they are selling a lot more jackets. In other words, both companies are selling stuff in part by looking like they\u2019re not trying too hard to sell stuff, which helps them sell more stuff \u2013 and fills the world with more and more stuff.</p> <p>You might call this the authenticity problem. And for all their similarities, the two companies are taking radically different approaches to solving it.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Doug Tompkins and Yvon Choiunar<strong>d</strong> were the kind of outcast adolescents who found a home in the great outdoors. Both men became passionate about climbing and surfing in the American west in the middle of the last century. Back in the 1950s and 60s, climbing was \u201can unusual sport with just a small group of renegades who were, you know, misfits\u201d, said Rick Ridgeway, an accomplished mountaineer and adventurer. (Rolling Stone magazine once called him \u201cThe Real Indiana Jones.\u201d) An old friend of both Tompkins and Choiunard, he is now vice president for public engagement at Patagonia.</p> <p>Both The North Face and Patagonia have their roots in exploring the sort of remote places about which guidebooks had not been written. In those days, getting back to uncorrupted nature and reading Thoreau by the campfire slotted in well with the nascent counterculture. \u201cWe took special pride in the fact that climbing rocks and icefalls had no economic value in society,\u201d Chouinard wrote in Let My People Go Surfing.</p> <p>Tompkins opened the first The North Face retail store selling mountaineering equipment in the North Beach neighbourhood of San Francisco in 1966. The Grateful Dead played at the opening, and there was a fashion show featuring Joan Baez and her sister, the late singer and activist Mimi Fari\u00f1a.</p> <p>In Southern California, Chouinard, who was among the pioneers of what has since become known as the \u201cgolden age of Yosemite climbing\u201d, had begun making his own equipment in the late 1950s. At first, he created and forged reusable steel pitons that were hammered into rock faces and then removed. Then, to help preserve climbing routes from disfigurement, Chouinard changed to aluminium chocks that could be wedged in by hand and did not leave a trace behind. The ambition at the time was to do as little damage as possible \u2013 as the Sierra climber Doug Robinson put it: \u201cOrganic climbing for the natural man.\u201d</p> <p>The two men met in the mid-60s when Tompkins began to distribute Chouinard\u2019s equipment through The North Face. Early in their friendship, a white-water kayaking trip together in California ended with Chouinard getting 15 stitches in his face. And in 1968 the two drove a Ford Econoline van from Ventura, California, to the remote region of Chile and Argentina named Patagonia.</p> <p>That same year, Tompkins sold his stake in The North Face for $50,000, and with his then wife, Susie, founded the San Francisco-based casualwear brand Esprit, whose hip version of sportswear became synonymous with 1980s style. After reading Bill Devall\u2019s environmental call to arms Deep Ecology: Living as if Nature Mattered in the 1980s, Tompkins decided to leave the apparel business and devote himself full time to saving the environment. By the time Esprit was sold in 1990, its annual sales were estimated to be $1bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"59ec44b48c10d0e346344d27bbbb0b4ddca4a4df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59ec44b48c10d0e346344d27bbbb0b4ddca4a4df/0_137_4366_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The opening of the first North Face shop in San Francisco, 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The opening of the first North Face shop in San Francisco, 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki HIll / The North Face</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chouinard had also branched out from mountaineering equipment. He had begun to import climbing wear, for sale, and in 1973, founded a new company named Patagonia. One of his earliest employees was Kris McDivitt, a downhill ski-racer. She became general manager and then CEO of Patagonia, before she met Doug Tompkins, who was then divorced.They married in 1993, a union of sorts between the two companies. Together the couple eventually bought 2.2m acres in Patagonia to conserve and live on full-time. They planned to protect this tract of wilderness, using the fortune he made from fuelling people\u2019s ambitions to explore the outdoors.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><br></h2> <p>If Tompkins\u2019s response to his dawning realisation that the apparel industry was damaging the environment was to sell his business and take direct action to save the Earth, then Chouinard, by contrast, decided to keep his company in private hands and run it in a way that might minimise environmental damage \u2013 a nearly impossible task that seems to weigh very heavily on him. \u201cEvil always wins if we do nothing,\u201d he writes in Let My People Go Surfing.</p> <p>The challenge of taking the moral high ground while still making and selling things is something that Rick Ridgeway also thinks about a great deal. \u201cOur mission is to build the best product, causing no unnecessary harm, then that second part of our mission is essentially saying that we\u2019ve got to do less bad,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make our product with the smallest footprint possible, but it is a footprint.\u201d</p> <p>For both men \u2013 who would not disagree with the radical environmentalist Edward Abbey\u2019s famous remark that \u201cgrowth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell\u201d \u2013 running an ethical business is an almost impossible challenge, if not a contradiction. Populating the world with more stuff that will eventually get thrown away is bad for the planet; the popularising of outdoor culture of all sorts is bad for specific places of natural beauty, which risk being overrun with people; and finally \u2013 and most difficult \u2013 the entire ethos of growth and profit and consumption is unsustainable for humanity and the health of the planet.</p> <p>Jill Dumain, the director of environment strategy, who has been at Patagonia for more than 27 years, can easily list all the ways the company is trying to do the right thing, among them the decision, in the 1990s, to use only organic cotton, and in 2013 to switch to torture-free goose down. (The North Face made the same move in 2014.) It has tried to replace as many of its synthetic materials as possible with recycled ones, although finding recycled zippers and buttons has been a struggle. Socially, it is committed to fair trade in its supply chain, in the mills and sewing factories it works with. This has led to the company splitting up with suppliers who were not willing or able to make the changes it demanded. These are the sorts of problems that Patagonia has chosen to explore to an almost obsessive degree. The idea of businesses being \u201ctransparent\u201d is wholly overused but, in Patagonia\u2019s case, it is fitting.</p> <p>Over time, Chouinard and Ridgeway matured into their roles as aging renegades: they appear as delightfully cranky old friends in a 2010 documentary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWBz_pxYC0A\">180 Degrees South: Conquerors of the Useless</a>, which follows a young writer and photographer as he attempts to retrace their now-legendary 1968 trip from California to Chile.</p> <p>Their adventures continued into December of 2015, when Chouinard, Ridgeway, Tompkins, and three other friends went on a seemingly gentle five-day kayaking trip to southern Chile. Ridgeway, who is 67, and Tompkins, 72, shared a kayak and it capsized in heavy waves in 4C water. The six men were rescued via patrol boat and helicopter but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/13/douglas-tompkins-co-founder-north-face-chile-conservation\">Tompkins suffered from severe hypothermia</a>. He died in a hospital that night.</p> <p>\u201cDoug had a visceral dislike for authority and always relished breaking the rules,\u201d Chouinard wrote. It was a heartfelt tribute to his old friend. In his book, Chouinard comes off as a grumpy, seasoned old-timer, constantly bemoaning the lack of credibility in everyone, everywhere. \u201cYvon calls himself the biggest pessimist in the world,\u201d says Dumain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"9e9e222953aec3c39865b294e092c7a908a15d56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e9e222953aec3c39865b294e092c7a908a15d56/0_191_3737_2242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doug Tompkins, co-founder of The North Face.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doug Tompkins, co-founder of The North Face.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chouinard and his wife Malinda divide their time between Ventura and their long-time home in Jackson Hole, a mountain resort town in Wyoming now known as a playground for the super-rich \u2013 Harrison Ford, Sandra Bullock and Dick Cheney all have homes there.</p> <p>Patagonia employees talk about Chouinard with the devotion usually reserved for cult leaders, but with a tone that suggests that they also view him as a somewhat mercurial genius. \u201cHe spends a lot of time outdoors like he always has,\u201d says Rose Marcario, Patagonia\u2019s CEO, \u201ca lot of time fishing, or teaching kids how to fish.\u201d When I called, he was always off somewhere; no one seemed to know quite where.</p> <p>By keeping Patagonia as a privately owned business, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/patagonia-values-led-business-benefit-corp\">Chouinard has been able to run it in a way that stays true to his values</a>.<strong> </strong>(Patagonia is organised as a for-profit company, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/patagonia-values-led-business-benefit-corp\">known as a B-Corp</a>, with certification for its social and environmental commitment.) \u201cWhen the company becomes the fatted calf, it\u2019s sold for a profit, and its resources and holdings are often ravaged and broken apart, leading to the disruption of family ties and the long-term health of local economies,\u201d he writes in Let My People Go Surfing. \u201cWhen you get away from the idea that a company is a product to be sold to the highest bidder in the shortest amount of time, all future decisions in the company are affected.\u201d</p> <p>Patagonia\u2019s competitors, The North Face included, are mostly public companies driven by shareholders. \u201cThe mission and the values of Patagonia have never been really about that,\u201d says Marcario. \u201cThey\u2019ve been about how much influence we can have on preserving and conserving the wild places that we love and play in, and how much influence we can have as a business to help change the model.\u201d</p> <p>But, while Tompkins left business altogether to save the wilderness, Chouinard seems like a man who will never stop being conflicted about what running a successful business entails. \u201cPatagonia will never be completely socially responsible,\u201d he has written. \u201cIt will never make a totally sustainable non-damaging product. But it is committed to trying.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Patagonia\u2019s headquarters are in Ventura, a small beach town in Southern California in between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. The buildings occupy a 5.5-acre campus and are painted in a signature buttery ochre colour used in most of the Patagonia retail stores around the world. There\u2019s a large playground for the onsite creche \u2013 an employee benefit so rare in the US that Patagonia published a book last summer about its child-friendly philosophy. The company prides itself in hiring relatively few people but looking after them all.</p> <p>There is something about being on the Patagonia campus that feels like being in a Scandinavian country \u2013 albeit one with banana plants, blooming agaves and jacaranda trees. There are solar panels, piles of surfboards for employees to use, and a car with a licence plate that reads BUMKIN. Offices have bean bags and stability balls to sit on, and the canteen serves organic kale blackberry salad. Then there\u2019s the shed that originally housed Chouinard\u2019s blacksmithing workshop, where he made climbing gear. It now feels a bit like a museum piece, frozen in the 1970s, but apparently Chouinard still tinkers around in it from time to time.</p> <p>The campus is the setting for many ostentatious efforts to do good. \u201cOne day I was walking down the steps and there were pieces of paper all over the sidewalks, and they all had arrows [on them] and said, \u2018Careful. Watch out. Butterfly chrysalis,\u2019\u201d Dean Carter, the vice president of human resources, told me.</p> <p>If this conspicuous altruism is grating to some people, they do not work at Patagonia. Still, the company says that it does not only recruit environmentally conscious do-gooders. \u201cIf we picked people who fit a specific mould, it could feel really culty,\u201d Carter said. \u201cBut we\u2019re just looking for threads; we\u2019re not looking for the entire quilt. We\u2019re looking for threads of caring for the environment, threads of caring about the outdoors, and threads of caring about families, collaborating, working.\u201d</p> <p>In a not-necessarily-cultish way, a lot of Patagonia employees go on to marry other Patagonia employees, and family members often work there too. Carter\u2019s own daughter is a receptionist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2584158b70067e78dc9bb1c91bc1ade9ae01f92c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2584158b70067e78dc9bb1c91bc1ade9ae01f92c/0_0_1392_2000/696.jpg\" alt=\"Yvon Chouinard in his workshop at the Patagonia headquarters in Ventura, California.\" width=\"696\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yvon Chouinard in his workshop at the Patagonia headquarters in Ventura, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Sayer Pearson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Companies wishing to improve their public image drop by to see if a little ethical stardust will rub off on them. Coca-Cola flew in a team from South Africa. There was even a visit from Chick-Fil-A, the US fast food chain famous for taking a public stance against same-sex marriage in 2012. I registered my surprise. \u201cExactly! And I have a partner. So they asked me if they could come. I was kind of like, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019\u201d Carter says. \u201cAnd obviously we don\u2019t share their values. But they have their very specific culture that they\u2019re living. And they were really sweet and kind.\u201d</p> <p>When Neil Blumenthal, co-founder of the fashionable eyewear startup <a href=\"https://www.warbyparker.com/\">Warby Parker</a>, came to visit, he was impressed by how much work went into research and development \u2013 he mentioned the way Patagonia tests its raincoats with waters of various alkalinity to mimic rain in different parts of the world. But what really struck him, he said, was the venue for his meeting with two Patagonia executives: \u201cInstead of taking the meeting in a conference room, we took a walk to the beach. For me it was pretty special; for them it was quite ordinary.\u201d</p> <p>Ridgeway \u2013 whose job as vice president of public engagement is to represent the company, whether at conferences or universities, or to executives who come to the Ventura headquarters \u2013 described the process of meeting visitors: \u201cThey go on a tour, we walk around and talk about the values and how we live the values. Usually we get some local organically grown food and we answer questions and share a story,\u201d Ridgeway told me. \u201cAnd then we are curious what their story is.\u201d</p> <p>Ridgeway can sometimes sound a little weary at having to explain to outsiders a way of life that comes quite naturally to him. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hold ourselves up in some arrogant exclusivity,\u201d Ridgeway said, but then described the kind of customer that Patagonia does not \u201cnecessarily want to invite under our umbrella\u201d. Namely, people who want to climb Mount Everest for bragging rights \u2013 the sort of affluent adventurers, drawn to climbing in part by Patagonia, whose impact Chouinard now regrets so much. \u201cSomeone who has paid $100,000 for a guided climb where the sherpas put the route in and risked their lives fixing the lines and carried all your stuff up for you and positioned your oxygen balls so you could go up and come back and say you climbed Everest. That doesn\u2019t work for us,\u201d Ridgeway says. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t mind saying it publicly.\u201d</p> <p>In its pursuit of authenticity, Patagonia tries to avoid malls, and only takes over spaces that mean something to the community. (One of its four Manhattan stores is located on the Bowery, next to the former location of the punk club CBGB, which is now a John Varvatos boutique.) It prides itself on pushing up against the limits of how ethical a company can be while actually still selling things: quality goods, ethical labour and manufacturing, no debt, even a tax strategy, according to Chouinard\u2019s book, \u201cto pay our fair share and not a penny more\u201d.</p> <p>The company is hyper-aware of these contradictions, perhaps to the point of tying itself in knots. In 2011, on Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year in the US, Patagonia ran an ad featuring a photo of a plush blue fleece, and copy that read DON\u2019T BUY THIS JACKET. The advert invited customers to make a commitment to reduce what they buy, repair their gear and recycle the stuff they no longer need. (Patagonia\u2019s campus in Reno, Nevada houses the largest garment repair facility in North America.) But it had the opposite effect: Patagonia\u2019s Black Friday sales increased by 30% over the previous year. The anti-sales message, as they might have expected, made consumers feel better about buying more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"69f428c81e02c100e56a8bd068895ee4565819e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69f428c81e02c100e56a8bd068895ee4565819e7/0_0_652_1250/522.jpg\" alt=\"Patagonia\u2019s Don\u2019t Buy This Jacket advert.\" width=\"522\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patagonia\u2019s Don\u2019t Buy This Jacket advert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The company\u2019s attempts to expand into new markets have a similar blend of moral commitment and financial savvy. In 2013, it launched a venture fund to invest in environmentally and socially responsible for-profit startups. In 2012, the company launched a food line named Patagonia Provisions, which includes buffalo jerky, smoked wild Sockeye salmon and, beginning last October, a beer made with a grain called kernza, which can be grown year-round. The target market is \u201cconcerned moms that want to make sure they\u2019re giving their kids organic, non-GMO food\u201d, Rose Marcario told me. The new food division, she added, has won the company \u201ca whole new set of customers\u201d.</p> <h2>* * * </h2> <p>At the headquarters of The North Face in Alameda \u2013 just across the bay from San Francisco \u2013 there is a similar preoccupation with being green and avoiding waste. During a visit last summer, I had a lunch of sustainably raised salmon with Todd Spaletto, who became president of the company in 2011. The building where we dined was insulated with recycled blue jeans, and there were composting bins, solar panels and free charging stations for electric cars. One building housed a vast area dedicated to repairing clothes under the company\u2019s lifetime warranty. As we ate, a team out on the lawn was testing out the set-up of a large, complicated-looking hexagonal tent.</p> <p>A visitor to The North Face campus encounters the same sporty feel as at Patagonia HQ \u2013 but instead of Patagonia\u2019s crunchy \u201csoul surfer\u201d vibe, here there is an edge of elite athleticism, whether in the form of employees doing bootcamp workouts and agility drills in the well-equipped gym, or a casual mention that Dean Karnazes was there just the other day, leading a group run along the water.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my first weeks on the job, I was talking to somebody and they were like, \u2018What are you doing this weekend?\u2019\u201d Spaletto recalled, smiling. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m pretty excited, I\u2019m running a half-marathon.\u2019 And they were like\u201d \u2013 and here he adopted a tone reserved for motivating small children \u2013 \u201c\u2018That\u2019s great, you gotta start somewhere!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lately The North Face has been focusing more and more on a younger, casual customer whose main interest in hiking is the part where they get to drink beer around a campfire. \u201cWhy does the youthful millennial consumer go outdoors?\u201d Spaletto asked. \u201cThey value one thing above all else. It\u2019s this whole idea of these genuine experiential moments that you share with your friends.\u201d</p> <p>These youthful consumers may even decide they can afford to skip the hike and go straight to the beer. But as The North Face positions itself as a fashion brand as much as an outdoor wear company, a new dilemma arises. The casual customer is drawn both to style and to the authenticity of owning real technical gear \u2013 but if the gear itself announces its technical utility too loudly, it ceases to be fashionable.</p> <p>\u201cThe outdoor industry has prided itself on showing the technology on the outside \u2013 seams sealed, zippers taped. That is very much core to this industry, everybody does it,\u201d said Sumie Scott, the senior product director for \u201cmountain culture\u201d at The North Face. \u201cBut the more youthful consumer wants hidden technology. So that\u2019s the challenge, how do you get them to know that technology exists?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat The North Face tries to push is this high, high performance extremity,\u201d said Cathy Begien, who worked in visual merchandising at The North Face a decade ago, and has since gone on to work at Prada, Opening Ceremony, and Warby Parker. \u201cThey would say, \u2018Cathy use Everest imagery or rock climbing.\u2019 But I\u2019m in a mall and people are pushing strollers around at 8am. I don\u2019t think they care about whether an alpinist would want this, or an ultra-marathoner,\u201d Begien recalled. \u201cHoliday season was the only time I didn\u2019t have to talk about mountain climbing or water rafting and could just show a bunch of jackets in a way the typical mall consumer can understand: this one is gonna keep you warm, this one is gonna keep you warmer, this one is gonna keep you warmest.\u201d</p> <p>The high cost of North Face gear creates high expectations: \u201cYou get a fairly affluent customer who expects meticulous service. You have to behave as though you\u2019re working at a Vuitton or a Gucci,\u201d said Caitlin Kelly, a journalist who took a job at a North Face outlet in suburban New York after losing her reporting job during the 2008 recession, and wrote a book, titled Malled, about the experience. \u201cIt was a long, narrow store. And when you walked in, half the store was fashion, half was \u2018Let\u2019s climb Everest\u2019. It was massively confusing to the shopper.\u201d</p> <p>The North Face wants to do style and adventure. It has collaborated on slippers and puffer jackets with Supreme, the skateboarding brand with a cult following. (Drake wore a jacket from the collection in the video for his 2011 single The Motto.) The trend among makers of serious technical gear is for designs that don\u2019t look like you are about to climb to Camp 4 on Everest \u2013 while at the same time, couture designers are increasingly showing items inspired by authentic outdoor gear. Patrik Ervell, Steven Alan and Louis Vuitton have all designed fleece jackets that appear to be a riff on Patagonia\u2019s Retro-X; puffer jackets have started to appear on the covers of fashion magazines, thanks in part to Balenciaga\u2019s $3,000 parkas.</p> <p>The desire to broadcast a sense of adventure while still looking good may have something to do with the biggest trend in athletic gear in recent years: the rise of \u201cathleisure\u201d \u2013 clothes that suggest, rather than insist on, performance, designed to transition from workout to sofa. Leggings \u2013 whether made by<strong> </strong>The Gap or Alexander Wang \u2013 are the most popular form of sporting loungewear (or is it lounging sportswear), having replaced denim as the preferred casual wear for women. The UK sportswear market will surpass \u00a38bn by 2020, fuelled by the rise of athleisure. In addition to gear for high-altitude camping and open-water diving, both The North Face and Patagonia sell leggings and sweatpants and T-shirts and all manner of gear best suited for hanging out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>North Face has the misfortune of being east-coast prep-school girls wearing black puffers and Uggs</p> <footer> <cite>Matt Langer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But for The North Face, exercising feels like an urban moral imperative, much as recycling does at Patagonia \u2013 a duty to care for oneself in tandem with caring about nature. While The North Face nominally shares the same ethos as Patagonia in terms of protecting the planet, its status as a publicly traded company means it has to maximise profits, which goes with the company\u2019s type-A branding \u2013 you are not going to see any North Face slow-growth manifestos or \u201cDon\u2019t Buy This Jacket\u201d ads. In fact, after The North Face announced in October that its third-quarter revenue had dropped 1%, Spaletto, my summer lunch companion, quietly departed the company.</p> <p>If the risk for Patagonia is to be seen just like any other company \u2013 one that cares as much about profits as the environment \u2013 then the comparable risk for The North Face is to be associated with suburban parents and college students whose greatest trek is across the quad, rather than trailrunners, mountain climbers and the occasional well-dressed rapper. It has to remain authentic enough to represent authenticity for the casual customer, without being so authentic that those people stop buying.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>\u201cNorth Face has the misfortune of being east-coast prep-school girls wearing black puffers and Uggs,\u201d says Matt Langer \u2013 a cyclist, New Mexico resident and Patagonia customer. He\u2019s a friend of a friend whose Instagram looks like a real-life recreation of the Patagonia catalogue, complete with fly-fishing, long-distance mountain biking, an adorable dog and waterfalls. Patagonia\u2019s marketing is spot on, he says, a bit sheepishly. \u201cI am a bearded white guy drinking beer around the campfire.\u201d</p> <p>For the committed outdoorsman \u2013 who styles himself a rugged individualist, untouched by the whims of fashion \u2013 there\u2019s an ambivalence at being so accurately cast. That stereotype, says Josh Contois, who I met on a group hiking trip in California last year, \u201cis to be a dirtbag and live frugally and also wear a $250 jacket\u201d. (Outside Magazine once called Chouinard \u201cKing of the Dirtbags\u201d.) Both Contois and Langer wear Patagonia in a way that would make Chouinard smile, even though much of their actual equipment comes from niche brands. For the real dirtbag, who now regards The North Face somewhat like McDonald\u2019s or Wal-Mart, even Patagonia has mostly sold out to the urban yuppie.</p> <p>The true adventurer instead buys even more expensive, precious, and specialised gear \u2013 from tiny companies owned and operated by fellow mountaineers in outdoor meccas such as Boulder, Colorado or Bend, Oregon.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, Patagonia appeals to \u2013 I don\u2019t want to sound like a smartass \u2013 but people driving Range Rovers who shop at Whole Foods,\u201d said Doug Heinrich, an executive at the Utah-based Black Diamond Equipment \u2013 Chouinard\u2019s original climbing equipment company, which was renamed after he sold it to an employee in the 1980s. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t appeal to core climbers, but we\u2019re going to appeal to that hardcore climber more than Patagonia would.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/20/why-are-deadly-extreme-sports-more-popular-than-ever\">Why are deadly extreme sports more popular than ever?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the other end of the spectrum, there is another crop of companies who appeal to the super-rich (or design fetishists) by trying to out-fancy Patagonia and The North Face on both technical sophistication and price. The small Canadian brand Arc\u2019teryx produces a high-end line called Veilance, which promises \u201cminimalist style with total performance\u201d, and looks as if Prada made high-tech outdoor gear, with prices to match. Canada Goose, whose \u201cArctic luxury apparel\u201d is worn by scientists at the South Pole, offers a \u201cKensington\u201d Parka priced at \u00a3850.</p> <p>There is something undeniably alluring about the lengthy descriptions of the technical merits of all this cutting-edge gear: the insulation that traps air for reduced heat loss and increased warmth, the underarm vents, the wrist accessory pocket, the reminder that your jacket is coming with a lifetime warranty, even if it isn\u2019t destined to leave the borough of Manhattan. That, after all, was always the bedrock of high fashion \u2013 people justified the prices of a cashmere sweater or a leather jacket because what they bought was well made, beautifully crafted, and lasted for ever.</p> <p>This may be what appeals to such customers as the man who recently came into the San Francisco North Face store and bought a Himalayan suit, which is filled with goose down and costs $1,000.</p> <p>The sales copy describes the item thus: \u201cTechnical, insulated full-body suit for climbing 8,000-metre peaks, the Himalayan Suit is a necessity for athletes aiming to reach the top of the world.\u201d It looks like a yellow and black sleeping bag with arms and legs and, according to the catalogue, includes \u201ccritical features based on Conrad Anker\u2019s feedback and proven on Mount Everest, where the athlete team successfully reached summit\u201d. The staff at The North Face store asked the customer where he was planning on going with his Himalayan suit. Nowhere, he said. He was just buying it because it was cool.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/jul/20/sign-up-to-the-long-read-email\">here</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 March 2017.
