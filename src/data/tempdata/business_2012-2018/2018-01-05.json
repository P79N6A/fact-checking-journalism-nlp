      "bodyText": "And finally.... the Dow Jones has continued to \u2018melt-up\u2019 with aplomb. The benchmark US stock index gained another 220 points, or 0.88%, to finish the day at 25,295, which is obviously a new all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 also hit a new closing high, as Wall Street celebrated its best start to a new year since 2006. Economic optimism, and predictions that US interest rates won\u2019t be hiked too quickly, helped to push shares higher. Can the bull market continue next week? Come back on Monday to find out :) Until then, goodnight! GW Hello again. Marketwatch has an interesting explanation for the market rally: Investors are feeling good about the U.S. stock market. In fact, they haven\u2019t felt this good in years. The latest AAII investor sentiment survey, conducted on Jan. 3., indicates that 59.8% of polled investors are bullish on the market, meaning they expect prices will be higher in six months. That\u2019s the highest level in about seven years, since a reading of 63.3% on Dec. 23, 2010, and it is significantly above the 38.5% historical average. The number of bullish investors has gone up by 7.1 percentage points in the past week alone. There has been a corresponding drop in both bearish and neutral investors. The percentage of market pessimists has dropped to 15.6%, down 5.1 percentage points over the last week, while neutral investors have slid by 2 percentage points to 24.7%. Both are below their historical averages, which is 30.5% for bears and 31% for neutral investors. More here: Bullish sentiment for U.S. stocks is at a seven-year high OK, time for a recap. The global stock market rally has driven Britain and America\u2019s stock markets to fresh highs today, despite an underwhelming employment report from the US. The Dow Jones index has pushed further over the 25,000 mark, while in London the FTSE 100 has closed at a new peak over 7,700. Shares jumped despite the news that America\u2019s economy didn\u2019t create as many jobs in December as expected. The closely-watched Non-Farm Payroll only rose by 148,000, missing forecasts of a 190,000 gain, while wage growth was unexceptional at 2.5% over the last year. My colleague Dominic Rushe explains: The headline numbers suggest that the jobs market remains strong. The labor department announced that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% in December, close to a 17-year low. The US economy has now added more than 2m jobs a year for seven straight years, a run last seen in the 1990s. But the pace of hiring has slowed, the recovery remains uneven, and wages continue to lag behind growth. Analysts voiced concerns that US retailers cut jobs in December - despite the festive shopping season. In the UK, car sales fell in December for the first time since 2011 - and by the biggest amount since 2009. Further falls are expected in 2018, as consumers continue to shun diesel cars -- with some switching to electric cars instead. The automobile industry is now urging the government to agree a Brexit transition deal by March, at the latest, otherwise manufacturers will be forced to trigger contingency plans. I\u2019ll be back later with the close of Wall Street.... Boom! The FTSE 100 has ended the week at a new all-time high. The blue-chip index of the biggest companies listed in London has closed at 7724 - the first time it has finished over the 7700 mark. That\u2019s a gain of 28 points, or 0.37%. Energy provider Centrica and water group United Utilities were the biggest risers, up around 3% after an analyst upgrade. But insurance group Admiral led the fallers, down 3% after figures showed UK car sales fell last year - and may keep falling in 2018. Fewer new cars means less insurance business. Other European markets also had a strong day, as the first week of 2018 gets off to a strong start. No wonder analysts are talking about a \u2018melt-up\u2019.... I missed this detail earlier, but the opening bell of the New York stock exchange was rung by a professional bull rider - J.B. Mauney. This honour was to mark the 25 anniversary of Professional Bull Riders (an enterprise devoted to the noble art of not falling off a 2000 pound bull with a temper). You know you\u2019re in a bull market when you see stetsons on a trading floor.... With 30 minutes to go, London\u2019s stock market could end the week at a new record high. The FTSE has dropped back from this morning\u2019s intraday peaks, but is still 11 points higher than yesterday\u2019s record close, at 7707 points. Here\u2019s a nice summary of the US jobs report: Just in: German lender Deutsche Bank says Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform package will cost it \u20ac1.5bn. This makes Deutsche Bank the latest in a string of major companies to announce that their deferred tax assets are less valuable, now that America\u2019s corporation tax rate is being cut from 35% to 21%. Deutsche also says that weak markets have hit its revenues, meaning it will post a small loss for the fourth quarter of the financial year. This has sent Deutsche\u2019s shares sliding almost 5%. It\u2019s slightly ironic, as Deutsche Bank has been a major lender to Donald Trump over the years (a relationship that has come under increasing scrutiny). MSNBC\u2019s Steve Benen have calculated that US job creation slowed last year - the first 12 months of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. Benen writes: Now that we have data for all of the previous calendar year, we can note that the U.S. added 1.84 million jobs in 2011, 2.19 million jobs in 2012, 2.33 million in 2013, 3.11 million in 2014, 2.74 million in 2015, 2.24 million in 2016, and 2.05 million in 2017. Or put another way, while Donald Trump\u2019s first year as president has been pretty good overall for job creation, Americans nevertheless saw the slowest job growth in six years. Newsflash: US factory orders rose by 1.3% in November, beating the consensus forecast of 1.1% growth. That\u2019s up from 0.4% in October, and the fourth monthly rise in a row. American factories reported rising demand for transportation and electrical equipment. However.... the latest survey of America\u2019s services sector is less impressive. Growth slowed to a four-month low in December, according to ISM\u2019s non-manufacturing index which has dipped to 55.9 from 57.6. Boom! The US stock market has hit fresh record highs (yet again) at the start of trading in New York. Traders are shrugging off the news that America\u2019s job creation slowed last month. The Dow Jones continued its march upwards, gaining 70 points to 25,145. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are also pushing higher, as the bull market shows no inclination to fizzle out. But while shares rise, the US dollar has dropped. Jacob Deppe, Head of Trading at online trading platform, Infinox, explains: \u201cSurprisingly, Wall Street shook off the lower than expected jobs data and rose still higher, although the Dollar fell 0.3% versus the Euro and 0.26% versus the Pound on the news. \u201cDecember\u2019s Non-Farm Payrolls data does not fit the current narrative of booming US growth. The initial reaction from the market is to ignore. That could be perilous. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible markets have decided the recent harsh weather contributed to the slowdown in jobs The good news is that America\u2019s economy has now created jobs for 87 months in a row - dating back to early in Barack Obama\u2019s first term as president. That has helped to pull the jobless rate down to its lowest since the end of 2000, at just 4.1%. Bart Hordijk, Market Analyst at Monex Europe, says the US may be approaching full employment: \u201c2017 has been an extraordinary year for the US labour market, with around 200K jobs added every month, leading the Unemployment Rate to its lowest point in 16 years. The fact that we now see a slowdown can be more of a sign of employers not being able to find qualified personnel, than it is an indicator of weakness in the US economy. Despite the fact that the Hourly Earnings Growth remains soft, this can report can still be a nudge for the Federal Reserve in the direction of hiking the rates. The 148,000 increase in the US non-farm payroll last month was \u201cslightly disappointing\u2019, says Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. He also singles out the drop in retail employment: Looking at the December gain in detail, manufacturing had a strong month, adding 25,000 jobs. Given the strength of the global economy, the decline in the dollar and the recent strength evident in the surveys, we can expect further factory job gains in the next few months. The obvious weakness was in retail, which shed 20,300 jobs. That could be just noise or a consequence of the shift from bricks and mortar stores to online. As a comparison, couriers &amp; messengers added only 2,100 jobs, so in net terms the structural shift is hardly positive for employmen Kully Samra, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab, says: \u201cThe US economy ended on a mixed note in 2017. However, despite disappointing job numbers, over the year average hourly earnings have risen by 2.5%. In addition, we have seen the economy grow quarter on quarter, manufacturing and services indices rise and other factors such as business confidence and housing are also picking up. Here\u2019s Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management, on today\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll: \u201cThere was something for everyone in the latest US Labour Market Report. On the one hand, employment growth slipped below 200,000 after a couple of strong months, while on the other, the headline rate of unemployment remained very low at just 4.1%, on an unchanged participation rate. Wage growth ticked higher to 2.5%, still a very modest rate despite the sharp fall in unemployment over the past few years. \u201cThe Federal Reserve puts much more weight on labour market data than on any other information, including the volatile and often misleading early estimates for GDP. Most survey based indicators of economic growth are strong in the US, and while the current severe weather is bound to impact economic activity in Q1, the Fed tend to look through these events, and are still on track to raise interest rates once again in March.\u201d Jobs site Indeed.com have made a handy charts showing where jobs were created, or destroyed, last month across the US economy: Ben Casselman of the New York Times is also worried by the fall in retail jobs Seth Harris, who was deputy US labor secretary under president Obama, is concerned by the rise in under-employment (the U-6 rate). He tweets: Yikes! America\u2019s retail sector cut around 20,000 jobs last month, according to today\u2019s non-farm payroll. That could be proof that the rise of internet shopping is forcing Main Street stores to cut back. The NFP report also shows a 55,000 increase in goods-producing jobs, a 30,000 increase in construction, and a 91,000 increase in service-sector roles. Worryingly, the US under-employment rate rose to 8.1% in December, from 8.0% in October. That means more Americans wanted to work more hours than they were able. In better news, November\u2019s non-farm payroll has been revised up to show 252,000 new jobs were created (up from 228,000). But what the revisions give with one hand, they take with the other. October\u2019s NFP has been revised down to 211,000, from 244,000. Instant reaction - this isn\u2019t a great jobs report. It\u2019s not a disaster either. On wages..... earnings rose by 2.5% per year in December, as expected. But November\u2019s wage data has been revised down, to 2.4% (from 2.5%). Breaking! The US economy created 148,000 new jobs in December. That\u2019s rather less than the 190,000 which economists had predicted. The unemployment rate has come in at 4.1% - unchanged on last month. More to follow..... No argument.... Just five minutes to go, and the excitement is building.... The US jobs report is notoriously hard to predict, and invariably revised sometime in the future. But the Non-Farm Payroll is still one of the most eagerly awaited pieces of economic data in the calendar, as it gives an insight into how the world\u2019s largest labo(u)r market is performing. As Naeem Aslam of Think Markets puts it: Today is the day- the most important economic data, the US Non-Farm Payroll number, on the face of the earth will reveal its colour. This number sets the trading tone and the trend for the rest of the month for traders. Today\u2019s number would provide us significant clues if the moderate growth in the US economy has left any impact on the jobs market, most importantly on the wage growth. Since the financial recession, the jobs market has been strengthening and this momentum was set by former President Barak Obama and Mr Trump is reaping the rewards. World stock markets are at record levels today, partly thanks to Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 hitting new heights this morning. And Wall Street is likely to push the bull market even higher when trading begins -- unless the US jobs report is a shock. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM says: Another day, another record high for world stocks, as a growing sense of optimism over the global economy boosts risk sentiment. Asian shares ventured higher during early trading on Friday, while European markets opened on a positive note amid the risk-on environment. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 25,000 for the first time ever on Thursday, U.S equity bulls are clearly back in town and as such, we could see further gains on Wall Street this afternoon. Investors on both side of the Atlantic are bracing for the latest US jobs report to hit the wires, in 35 minutes time. December\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll is expected to show that America\u2019s economy created around 190,000 new jobs last month, leaving the unemployment rate at just 4.1%. However, there is talk that the NFP could be better, after another survey yesterday suggested that US firms hired 250,000 people in December. Here\u2019s a round-up of the latest Wall Street forecasts: Economists will also be looking closely at the wage growth figures, for signs that the US economic recovery is reaching workers\u2019 pockets. Average earnings are expected to have risen by 2.5% per year, the same as a month ago, and by 0.3% in December alone. Craig Erlam of City firm Oanda says: We\u2019ve been promised higher inflation and wage growth for some time and investors are increasingly not buying it. Even some policy makers are starting to question why nothing has not materialised and should that continue, rate hike forecasts will start to slip, especially with interest rates now already elevated. Today\u2019s jobs report should offer some insight on this, with average earnings having arguably become the most important component of it. Still earnings are only expected to have risen by 2.5% compared to a year ago, below last year\u2019s peak and well below where they need to be for inflation to sustainably return to target. Whatever happens, we\u2019ll probably hear Donald Trump\u2019s views through the usual channel.... The Labour Party is also voicing concerns about the drop in UK car sales last year. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, says: \u201cThe Government\u2019s mismanagement of the economy and mishandling of the Brexit negotiations has shaken consumer and business confidence and it\u2019s concerning that the sales of new cars are falling. \u201cThe industry has been warning the Government time and time again and, as has become typical with the Tories, they have failed to listen or take action. \u201cThe British car industry is a vital part of our economy, directly employing up to 170,000 people. Labour\u2019s Industrial Strategy will set out a radical programme of investment and genuine partnership between industry and government, to protect vital jobs and build an economy that works for the many, not the few.\u201d Here\u2019s our financial editor, Nils Pratley, on the idea that markets are in a melt-up phase: Over in the City, the FTSE 100 index has climbed to new heights. It just hit 7727 points for the first time, up 0.4% or 31 points today, as the global stock market rally continues to bubble away. Markets have been surging in recent weeks, and there is plenty of talk that shares will keep rising as markets \u2018melt-up\u2019. Rupert Harrison of asset manager BlackRock (and former top official in the UK Treasury), told Bloomberg TV that \u201cthere are very good reasons to be positive\u201d Harrisons says: Since coming back from New Year, the phrase I\u2019ve heard most is \u2018melt up\u2019. There\u2019s been a strong start to the year, and there are good reasons for that - the data is staying barn-stormingly strong. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any sign of the reversion to the mean that people had been looking out for. On top of that, you\u2019ve got tax cuts in the US juicing the prospects for earnings and also potentially boosting the Capex cycle we are in. But, Harrison also cautions that there are some potential risks, including: Everyone is \u2018bought in\u2019 to the idea that global growth will continue, so any slowdown could alarm investors.. Trade policy: Donald Trump must soon decide whether to take action against China over the alleged dumping of cheap metals and solar panels. The US president is up early, and wasted no time in tweeting about the bull market: But as one City expert has already pointed out, each 1,000 point gain is less impressive than the last one..... While diesel sales slumped by 17% last year, sales of alternatively-fuelled vehicles jumped by almost 35% as more people bought electric cars. This shows that consumers are keen to drive less polluting vehicles, argues Greenpeace UK\u2019s clean air campaigner Paul Morozzo. He says: \u201cSales of diesel cars are falling but sales of EVs and hybrids are growing at double-digit rates. Consumers are sending a clear message to the car industry that it\u2019s time to move on from polluting diesel and the industry should listen to it. Diesel cars have been fuelling a major air pollution crisis that has made our cities\u2019 air toxic and harmful to breathe. EVs and hybrids are better for both air quality and the climate. If the UK car industry fails to invest in the technologies that consumers want then they\u2019ll be left behind in the race for this trillion-dollar market.\u201d This charts hows how the market changed last year: Back to cars, and Ana Nicholls of the Economist Intelligence Unit, has identified several reasons for the drop in sales last year: Most people who can afford a new car have bought one recently, and pent-up demand from the auto market crash during the financial crisis is now completely sated. The average age of cars on the road is now less than eight years, so there\u2019s little replacement demand. Consumer confidence is faltering: with incomes nearly stagnant and the outlook uncertain because of Brexit people are becoming less keen to take out credit. November\u2019s rise in interest rates didn\u2019t help, raising many people\u2019s mortgage payments and making the financing deals from dealers less attractive A drop in PPI claims has also cut the number of people with one-off lump sums to spend. The sharp slump in diesel sales, after the VW scandal exposed concerns about NOx emissions. With the London congestion charge now higher, and the vehicle excise duty due to rise for the most polluting diesels, buyers are edging away rapidly. In the longer term there will be a shift towards electric cars, but at the moment sales (though fast-growing) are too low to make up the difference. The latest inflation figures from the eurozone are out -- and they show that prices are rising more slowly than expected. Despite the European Central Bank\u2019s huge money-printing operation, eurozone inflation probably only rose by 1.4% per year in December, down from 1.5% in November. Energy prices were up 3% year-on-year, down from 4.7% in November, while food, alcohol and tobacco inflation dipped to 2.1% from 2.2%. This seems to vindicate the ECB\u2019s decision to press on with its monetary stimulus -- which has been a factor behind the rise in stock markets recently. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Breaking away from the car sales figures.... we have good news for the UK economy. UK productivity (basically how much each worker actually produces) jumped by 0.9% in the third quarter of last year, new figures show. That\u2019s the largest increase in productivity since April-June 2011, and may show that future growth will stronger than previously expected. Labour productivity grew in both the services and manufacturing industries, according to the Office for National Statistics. This looks like good news for the UK government. Last autumn, the independent Office for National Statistics slashed its forecast for productivity growth, having concluded that it would not recover to its levels before the financial crisis. Weak productivity leads to slower economy growth, smaller tax receipts and higher government borrowing. But.... UK productivity has still taken a severe knock over the last decade, and basically flat-lined since the financial crisis. Unions fear that British car workers could be laid off this year, if sales don\u2019t recover. Tony Burke, assistant general secretary of Unite, says the UK\u2019s \u201cworld class car workers\u201d will be looking to the year ahead with trepidation\u201d, adding: \u201cThe government has caused confusion and damage with its policy on diesel cars and needs to start listening to the industry and workforce. Diesel engines produced by Unite members in the UK are the cleanest in the world. \u201cMinisters\u2019 botched and badly thought through announcements are causing major damage to the industry. Combined with economic and Brexit uncertainty this risks taking the sheen off the jewel in the UK\u2019s manufacturing crown and the 800,000 high skilled jobs it sustains. 2018 could be another bad year for the motor industry, if consumer confidence remains subdued. Richard Jones, managing director of motor finance group Black Horse, says the next few months will be crucial \u201cI believe we\u2019ll see new car sales continue to decline in the first quarter of 2018 given that this period in 2017 was so strong. This should help dampen fears of oversupply having a negative impact on used car prices and is positive in the long term by ensuring the new car market is operating from a sustainable position. I would also expect the used car market to continue to perform well. \u201cWith uncertainties facing the UK economy it\u2019s hard to make a confident forecast for 2018 as a whole. I believe a big test for the industry will come after quarter one when we will see how the underlying UK economy and consumer confidence is influencing car demand.\u201d Brexit is the biggest threat to the UK automobile industry this year, according to a new survey of car dealers from Close Brothers Motor Finance. More encouragingly, 92% of dealers are confident about business prospects in the market for 2018, up from 63% last year. However, that optimism could wilt if Britain doesn\u2019t agree a Brexit transition deal soon.... Worryingly, the drop in diesel car sales seems to have pushed emissions of carbon dioxide up. That\u2019s a disappointing consequence of consumers shunning diesel motors and buying petrol ones instead, following revelations that diesel cars were pumping more nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere than officially reported. The SMMT explains: Carbon tailpipe emissions have risen for the first time since 1997, with new cars averaging 121.04g/km, up 0.8% on 2016. Last year, UK new car CO2 emissions fell for the 19th consecutive year and this is the first year the figure has risen since records began. The SMMT have just issued a press release, confirming that UK car sales declined in 2017. Here are the key points: Overall annual demand falls -5.7% in 2017 \u2013 but new car market still third biggest in a decade at over 2.5 million vehicles. December represents the ninth consecutive month of decline, as registrations for final month of year drop -14.4%. Appetite for electrified cars reaches record high, with almost 120,000 alternatively fuelled vehicles (AFVs) hitting UK roads \u2013 a 34.8% uplift. Diesel demand declines -17.1%, undermining progress on emissions and CO2 as industry body warns consumers could end up paying more in fuel if they travel high mileages. There\u2019s a couple of handy charts too: In contrast to the UK, car sales in Germany actually rose last year. Auto sales in Europe\u2019s largest economy increased by 2.7% during 2017. However - as in Britain - diesel sales tumbled (by 13%). Reuters explains: Pressure is growing on Germany to tackle diesel pollution as dozens of cities including Munich and Stuttgart, where BMW and Daimler are based, could face penalties for allowing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels in excess of European Union limits introduced in 2010, the DUH environmental lobby has said. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a fresh intraday record high. The index of blue-chip companies gained another 12 points, or 0.15% points, to 7708 points, six points above yesterday\u2019s record levels. Rebecca O\u2019Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, says investor optimism is undimmed, for the moment.... European markets continue to make further gains, with the sheer scale of the global rally demonstrating how investors are embracing all things equity and risk related, basking in the euphoria of synchronous global growth. Equity markets, which were already strengthening well in advance of Trump\u2019s $1.5tn tax cut, or indeed a prospective US infrastructure bill that could form the centrepiece of 2018 legislation, show no sign of any stress, with new record highs an almost daily occurrence. With the party in full swing and implied volatility at such low levels, markets are seemingly immune to any possible downside, but the key risk that might ultimately bring markets down is inflation. A material increase in inflationary pressures would potentially force central banks to tighten rates faster than the market is expecting Chris Bosworth, Director of Strategy at Close Brothers Motor Finance, believes Brexit anxiety and opposition to diesel cars are the main reason car sales fell last year. \u201cToday\u2019s figures reflect the impact that anti-diesel messages from the government and ongoing Brexit trade negotiations are having on both business and consumer confidence across the motor industry. December marks the ninth month of consecutive decrease in new car sales as squeezed consumers are reluctant to purchase big ticket items such as cars and motorcycles. Alex Buttle, director of car buying comparison website Motorway.co.uk, says diesel\u2019s days are numbered (after the emissions scandal). He wants the government to offer more incentives to shift to electric. \u201cQuite frankly, 2017 has been a year to forget for the UK car industry. \u201cYou\u2019d have to dig pretty deep to find anything positive to take from the past 12 months which has seen diesel demonised in the media on a weekly basis. \u201cAs sales of new diesels continue to fall, 2017 could well mark the end of one era of motoring and the dawn of a new one, as hybrid and electric sales start to take off. \u201cThe destiny of diesel may already be set in stone. Now the Government needs to stand by its commitment to the future and put its full backing behind AFVs. \u201cIncentives to encourage consumers to switch to hybrid and electric vehicles need to run alongside the billions of pounds of investment being pumped into the supporting infrastructure. Bloomberg blames \u201cBrexit\u2019s impact on buyer confidence and lingering skepticism over the emissions performance of diesel cars\u201d for the 5.6% drop in UK car sales last year. The Financial Times agrees that Britain\u2019s car industry needs clarity about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU, fast: You can\u2019t wait until March 2019,\u201d [SMMT chief Mike Hawes] said, when the UK will leave the EU. \u201cProduction is a tap that takes a long time to turn on and off.\u201d The SMMT said contingency plans could include carmakers investing in additional warehouse capacity to guard against delivery disruptions, or deciding to expand production abroad rather than produce new models in the UK. Mr Hawes said that even the more limited changes, such as investing in warehouse capacity, were the \u201cthin end of the wedge\u201d because they would impose additional costs on British car manufacturers, making them less competitive and damaging their ability to attract new investment. It\u2019s official: Britain\u2019s car industry has suffered its biggest drop in sales since the financial crisis. Sales of new vehicles fell by 5.6% during 2017 - the first annual decline since 2011, and the worst since 2009. Diesel sales were particularly dire, as my colleague Gwyn Topham explains: UK car sales declined in 2017 after five years of rapid growth, with the industry blaming government for a collapse in consumer confidence in diesel vehicles. Total sales for last year were 2.54m new vehicles, a decline of 5.6% on 2016, with diesel sales dropping 17%. Despite the decline, 2017 sales remained near the highest on record. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK automotive industry\u2019s trade body, has forecast a further 5% to 7% decline in sales in 2018. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said 2017 had been a \u201cvery volatile year\u201d. While sales reached a record high in March, by December they were 13.9% down year-on-year, with 152,000 fewer cars sold than in the same month in 2016. Hawes attributed the drop to a decline in business and consumer confidence in the wider economy and uncertainty over the future of diesel. Sales of diesel cars dropped by 31% in December, while petrol car sales dropped by 1.6%, after relatively minor tax changes targeting diesel in the November budget. The SMMT is now urging the UK government to rapidly agree a Brexit transition deal with Brussels. Otherwise, Hawes warns, carmakers will soon be forced to take tough - and potentially irreversible - decisions. He says: \u201cSome investment decisions are overdue \u2026 we need clarity [on the terms of a transitional period] by the end of the first quarter.\u201d [Otherwise] They will have to start implementing contingency plans.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With stock markets at record levels, investors will be looking to today\u2019s US unemployment report for reasons to keep optimistic, and keep buying assets. The monthly non-farm payroll report is expected to show that America\u2019s economy continued to create jobs in December. The Wall Street consensus is that around 190,000 new workers were hired across the US last month, down from 228,000 in November. But it\u2019s possible that the NFP could be stronger. The figures will probably also show that America\u2019s unemployment rate remained at just 4.1%. But economists will be hoping to see evidence that employees are being paid more. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: On a month-on-month basis average earnings are tipped to increase by 0.3% and on an annual basis they are forecasted to rise by 2.5%. The US has been steadily creating new jobs over the past few years, but wage growth has been sluggish. If the US economy wants to step up a gear in terms of economic growth, wage growth and in turn the spending levels will need to tick up. Also coming up today. European stock markets are expected to open mixed, after Thursday\u2019s strong session drove the UK FTSE 100 to a new alltime high. Last night the US Dow Jones closed over 25,000 points for the first time ever, on hopes that the world economy will remain upbeat this year.

      "bodyText": "House of Fraser is seeking to cut the size of stores in an effort to slash its rent bill after a tough Christmas. The department store group, which was bought by Chinese conglomerate Sanpower in 2014, wants to cut its high street footprint by 30% over 10 years. It is understood the group does not want to close individual stores, other than the two closed last year in Leicester and Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. \u201cWe are shaving off surplus space such as a basement or top floors,\u201d a source close to the business said. There have been widespread rumours that House of Fraser will seek to close stores and cut its rent bill via a company voluntary arrangement, a form of insolvency.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wall Street has shrugged off slowing growth in US jobs, extending a surge in the stock market as the world\u2019s largest economy comes closer to reaching full employment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 0.2% in New York on Thursday morning, adding more than 50 points to reach 25,123, despite the weaker readings for job creation last month. Figures from the US labor department showed 148,000 new positions were created in December, below the forecasts of economists, as the retail sector shed 20,000 jobs over the holiday season. The headline numbers suggest that the jobs market remains strong. The labor department announced that the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1% in December, close to a 17-year low. Economists expect jobs growth to slow this year as the US labour market comes closer to full employment. The US economy has now added more than 2m jobs annually for seven straight years, a run last seen in the 1990s. But the pace of hiring has slowed, the recovery remains uneven, and wages continue to lag behind growth. Analysts had expected the US to add 180,000 jobs over the month. The labor department also cut its hiring figures for October and November, with a net downward revision of 9,000 jobs. The troubled retail sector lost 20,000 jobs over the month as the shift to online shopping took its toll even over the holiday season. The economy added new jobs in healthcare (up 31,000), construction (up 30,000) and manufacturing (up 25,000). Wages continued their sluggish recovery, rising 2.5% in December from a year earlier, despite expectations that lower unemployment would add to the bargaining power of workers to demand higher wages. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve will have been looking for signs of wage growth as they prepare to nudge interest rates higher. Stronger growth in pay typically leads to inflation \u2013 as companies raise prices offered to consumers to compensate for their higher wage bills \u2013 which can be kept in check using higher interest rates. Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, noted that December marked the 10th anniversary of the start of the last recession. \u201cWhile by some measures the economy has recovered, the topline numbers mask important differences in the experiences of working people,\u201d she said. \u201cEmployers should be lining up for workers \u2013 instead of workers competing for jobs.\u201d On Wednesday ADP, the US\u2019s largest payroll processor, said private employers had added 250,000 jobs over December. Anticipation of a more positive government jobs report had already driven stock markets to record highs. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, which helps compile the report, said: \u201cThe job market ended the year strongly. Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls. The tight labor market will get even tighter, raising the specter that it will overheat.\u201d The news from ADP sent stock markets soaring with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 25,000 for the first time. The Dow rose by more than 25% last year, driven up by low interest rates, expectation of tax cuts and a rebounding global economy.",

    "webTitle": "UK government spells out plan to shut down coal plants", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the UK\u2019s eight remaining coal power stations is expected to cease generating electricity this year, the government has said as it laid out new rules that will force all the plants to close by 2025. The coal phase-out is one of the Conservative party\u2019s flagship green policies, and the long-awaited implementation plan comes ahead of a speech by Theresa May on the environment next week. While three plants shut in 2016, and most are expected to halt operations by 2022, the last ones standing will be forced to close in October 2025 because of new pollution standards. However, the plan reveals the sector will continue to be propped up by hundreds of millions of pounds in backup power subsidies for several years, paid through consumer energy bills. Experts said allowing coal operators to continue receiving capacity market subsidies had thrown the sector an unnecessary lifeline. Dr Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a UK-based thinktank, said: \u201cWhile delivering on the top line of a 2025 closure, the government\u2019s decision to allow coal plants to compete in the capacity market on equal footing until then looks like something of a missed opportunity.\u201d Ministers will also retain emergency powers to suspend the phase-out in the case of an emergency shortfall in electricity supplies. \u201cWe consider it prudent for the secretary of state to retain provisions to act in emergency situations, as a last resort, where there might be a shortfall in electricity generation, or risk of one, and that suspension would wholly or partially mitigate that risk,\u201d the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said. But officials said it was unlikely those powers would be called on, because the gap created by the coal plants\u2019 closure would probably be filled by old gas power stations staying open longer. While no coal power stations closed in 2017, the government\u2019s official assessment points out that a carbon tax and relatively low gas prices have hurt the profitability of coal plants. As a result, it foresees one major plant will close this year, with the loss of up to 250 jobs, followed by a further closure next year. The government predicts coal\u2019s capacity of 13.8GW last year will have plummeted to 1.5GW by 2025 because of unfavourable economics. The government rejected calls by campaigners and industry groups for the deadline of 2025 to be brought forward, citing cost and energy security grounds. It also rebuffed suggestions of a gradual phase-out before 2025, arguing coal use was low enough to make that unnecessary. Coal\u2019s fall has been swift and dramatic, with power generation from the polluting fuel plunging by more than 80% since 2012. Plants have closed in recent years as EU pollution standards started to bite, but it was increases in the UK\u2019s carbon tax that sealed their fate. In the budget, the Treasury confirmed the levy would continue at the same level until 2025. The closure of the last coal plant in seven years\u2019 time will be mandated through the use of a new emissions performance standard, which ministers will need to legislate for. The standard sets a limit on the amount of carbon the plants can emit \u2013 450g CO2 per kW hour \u2013 which coal operators could meet only by retrofitting costly carbon capture equipment. Officials said the coal phase-out policy would cost less than 1% of an average household energy bill. Green groups welcomed the confirmation of the plan. Greenpeace hailed \u201csignificant progress on making coal history in the birthplace of the industrial revolution\u201d, while WWF praised government for \u201chitting this dirty industry where it hurts.\u201d However, ClientEarth cautioned against replacing coal with another fossil fuel. \u201cWe are concerned that the door is left wide open for investments in new, long-term gas capacity, locking us into another generation of fossil fuel power,\u201d said Sam Bright, energy lawyer at the campaigning law firm. Labour said while it backed the coal phase-out, more support was needed for clean power. Alan Whitehead, shadow energy minister, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s lacklustre support for renewables and scrappage of a number of green schemes has left it on course to miss its own climate targets.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson has defended the government bailout of Virgin Trains East Coast, saying he and partner firm Stagecoach have lost more than \u00a3100m running the route. In the Virgin Group owner\u2019s first public comments on the controversy, he said that the \u201cpromise of a huge upgrade\u201d of the line that is set to be delayed meant \u201ca discussion with government had to take place\u201d. The train company, a joint venture with Virgin branding but 90% owned by transport firm Stagecoach, won the contract to run the East Coast line after it was privatised in 2015. It was due to pay \u00a33.3bn to the government, the bulk of payments coming in the final years of its eight-year term. But the transport secretary Chris Grayling announced the contract would instead end early for a new \u201cpartnership model\u201d \u2013 potentially still operated by Stagecoach \u2013 starting in 2020. Lord Adonis cited the move, alongside the government\u2019s Brexit strategy, as the reason for his resignation last month from his government post as chair of the National Infrastructure Commission. On Friday Adonis welcomed what he called Branson\u2019s admission that a bailout had taken place, with Grayling continuing to avoid debate on the subject. Branson said that the \u00a33.3bn bid was \u201cbased on a number of key assumptions\u201d which have not come to fruition. Writing on his blog, he said the upgrade of East Coast infrastructure by Network Rail would have improved the reliability of the track and allowed Virgin to carry many more passengers. He said: \u201cThe considerable delays to this upgrade, to new trains, as well as poor track reliability will cost us significant lost revenue (amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds) and torpedoed the assumptions of our original bid. \u201cAs the facts became clear about these issues (as well as a drop in Britain\u2019s GDP growth) a discussion with government had to take place and a pragmatic solution was needed to keep delivering improvements and investment in the line.\u201d Passenger numbers failed to match Virgin\u2019s expectations from the start of the franchise, with intercity train travel mirroring wider economic uncertainty and sluggish growth in Britain. The government had however prioritised returning East Coast to the private sector, after the state-owned DOR ran it for six years wand was held up as a model for a renationalised railway. However, Branson claimed: \u201cWhen the operation of East Coast line was under public ownership before us there was little investment and the services were not modernised. Contrast that with the \u00a3140m we are investing, which has already seen a completely refurbished train fleet, more services, new car parking and cycle facilities and free films and TV on board.\u201d The Virgin president added: \u201cThe critics argue that my partners at Stagecoach and I are somehow benefitting from this. The fact is we have both lost significant amounts of money \u2013 well over \u00a3100m in total \u2013 and have not received a penny in dividends.\u201d He said that they could \u201cswallow those losses and simply walk away from the franchise as others have done before\u201d. Two previous operators, GNER and National Express, abandoned their franchise commitments \u2013 the latter after being refused a similar bailout by Adonis, the then transport secretary, in 2009. But, Branson said: \u201cThat would be easier. But it would also be wrong. It would bring an abrupt halt to the investment and improvements which are flowing into East Coast. It would mean more disruption to passengers, communities and our people.\u201d Reacting to Branson\u2019s comments, Adonis said: \u201cI\u2019m glad that Sir Richard Branson has been far more forthcoming than Chris Grayling about what happened on the East Coast. He states honestly that the losses have become too great for Virgin and Stagecoach to bear and that they were proposing to walk away. He also states they they were engaged in discussions with government about more favourable terms \u2013 which is precisely the bailout I have been exposing in recent weeks. \u201cIn the good times, Sir Richard and his fellow billionaire Brian Souter [the Stagecoach chairman] coined it from public rail contacts. What he now says is that they weren\u2019t prepared to sustain further losses despite the billions they have earned from rail contracts until now.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia has taken a key step towards allowing future investors to buy shares in its national oil company, as it prepares for the world\u2019s biggest stock market flotation later this year. Saudi Aramco was recently forced to deny it was planning to shelve plans for its $2tn flotation of 5% of the company, and the new change suggests the planned IPO is still on track. A royal decree published on Friday converted the firm into a joint stock company, meaning it can have more shareholders than its current sole shareholder, the Saudi government. \u201cThis is part of the preparation process for the IPO. You\u2019d expect that to happen,\u201d said a source close to Saudi Aramco. The decree changed the legal status of the oil company from 1 January. The source said the company was doing everything it needed to deliver the IPO for the Saudi government, which has insisted the flotation is on track for the second half of 2018. There has been intense speculation over where the international listing will take place, with London, New York and Hong Kong in the frame. The UK government had to deny last November that a $2bn loan to the oil company was tied to efforts to woo Saudi Aramco to list in London. The kingdom\u2019s top officials hope to list on New York but the company prefers London, but both may be ruled out because of regulatory obstacles, the Financial Times has reported. \u201cNo decision has made on the listing,\u201d a company source told the Guardian. Sceptics have questioned whether the listing will be as great as $2tn, but whatever the final valuation, it will hinge on the oil price. The price of Brent, the international benchmark, reached a two-and-a-half year high this week, at more than $68 a barrel, over the geopolitical uncertainty in Iran. The buoyant price has been driven in large part by the production cuts led by the oil cartel Opec, where Saudi Arabia is the dominant player, and Russia. The curbs were recently extended to the end of 2018, but will reviewed in June. Industry observers are keenly watching to see how much the cuts are offset by crude production increases by US shale drillers, driven by the higher oil price. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "The productivity of British workers has increased at the fastest rate in more than six years, handing the government a rare boost in correcting one of the biggest problems facing the UK economy. Labour productivity, or economic output per hour worked, grew by 0.9% in the three months to September 2017, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists said the jump came thanks to stronger growth in factory output, weaker jobs growth and the UK economy generating broadly the same amount of output for fewer hours worked. Philip Shaw, chief economist at City bank Investec, said falling numbers of people entering the workforce and fewer hours worked were also key reasons for the gains. When fewer people work fewer hours but economic output holds steady, efficiency levels naturally rise, he said. \u201cI\u2019d take one quarter\u2019s numbers with a pinch of salt. It\u2019s not at all bad news but difficult to embrace as a big change just yet in what is a disappointing history since crisis,\u201d he added. Nonetheless, the third quarter increase was the largest seen since the second quarter of 2011. But while the growth rate was in line with the overall rate for 2017 estimated by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s official economic forecaster, the reading is still well below the pre-financial crisis trend rate for the UK of about 2% a year. Sluggish growth in the efficiency of workers in Britain, held back in part since the financial crisis by the creation of low-skilled jobs, was one of the main reasons for the sharp downgrade in economic growth unveiled by the chancellor at the budget in the autumn. It has also been a key factor in holding down wages across the economy. Compounded by fears over further potential weakness from Brexit, ministers have placed boosting productivity among their top priorities, with additional investments in technology, infrastructure and training as part of the government\u2019s industrial strategy. The increase in productivity was fuelled by improved efficiency in the services sector, which is Britain\u2019s dominant industry, and has typically been a laggard in terms of boosting economic output per hour worked. There was also an increase in manufacturing output in the third quarter, as the UK\u2019s factories benefit from an upswing in global economic growth and the weak pound buoying demand for British goods among foreign buyers. Gross domestic product grew by 0.4% in the three months to September \u2013 a similar rate to previous months \u2013 while the number of hours worked fell by 0.5%. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said it looked like there had been further growth in productivity in the final three months of 2017. \u201cThe rebound in productivity in the third quarter is highly welcome, but it needs to be seen in the context of a particularly poor first half performance,\u201d he said. Previous UK economic downturns have typically seen productivity fall, before subsequently bouncing back to the previous trend rate of growth. This has not been the case in the years since the 2008 financial crisis, amid rising employment, particularly from low-skilled and low-paid jobs. The Office for National Statistics said productivity in the third quarter was 16.6% below its pre-downturn trend, and would have been 19.8% higher had it bounced back to its previous growth rate. Should Britain\u2019s productivity levels show further signs of progress, it will be likely to spark a robust debate about how the gains from that progress are shared. Trade unions have warned the greater use of technology in the workforce, which stands to boost efficiency, should not come at the expense of employment and growth in workers\u2019 pay. The UK is forecast to have the lowest pay growth in the OECD for 2018, as sluggish salary increases fail to keep pace with rising inflation. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "First fall in car sales since 2011 blamed on fears over diesel ban", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK car sales declined in 2017 after five years of rapid growth, with the industry blaming government for a collapse in consumer confidence in diesel vehicles. Total sales for last year were 2.54m new vehicles, a decline of 5.6% on 2016, with diesel sales dropping 17%. Despite the decline, 2017 sales remained near the highest on record. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the UK automotive industry\u2019s trade body, has forecast a further 5% to 7% decline in sales in 2018. Mike Hawes, the SMMT\u2019s chief executive, said 2017 had been a \u201cvery volatile year\u201d. While sales reached a record high in March, by December they were 13.9% down year-on-year, with 152,000 fewer cars sold than in the same month in 2016. Hawes attributed the drop to a decline in business and consumer confidence in the wider economy and uncertainty over the future of diesel. Sales of diesel cars dropped by 31% in December, while petrol car sales dropped by 1.6%, after relatively minor tax changes targeting diesel in the November budget. Earlier in the year, sales dropped after changes which came into effect on vehicle excise duty, as well as a government air quality plan which was widely reported as an eventual ban on diesel vehicles. Hawes contrasted the UK government\u2019s actions with those of the German chancellor Angela Merkel, who has funded clean air plans while reaffirming her commitment to the diesel car industry, battered by the Volkswagen scandal. He said: \u201cThere has been this underlying confusion among consumers over whether buying diesel was the right thing to do.\u201d High levels of particulates and NOx pollution from diesel engines have been cited as driving the air quality crisis, causing thousands of premature deaths a year in Britain. Hawes said the newest diesel engines were roughly equivalent to petrol, adding that the switch away from diesel would make cars more polluting in terms of CO2 emissions, due to diesels normally consuming less fuel than petrol equivalents.

Hawes said: \u201cSome investment decisions are overdue \u2026 we need clarity [on the terms of a transitional period] by the end of the first quarter.\u201d Otherwise, he added: \u201cThey will have to start implementing contingency plans.\u201d \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",

      "bodyText": "Debenhams is to cut jobs and consider more store closures after a poor festive trading period led to a major profits warning. Shares in the department store dropped by 15% to 30p, the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, after it warned that sales of seasonal gifts and clothing had fallen despite heavy discounting. Sales fell 2.6% at Debenhams\u2019 established UK stores, open for more than a year, in the 17 weeks to 30 December. In a gloomy statement on its Christmas trading performance, issued a week earlier than anticipated, Debenhams said profits would be about 30% lower than expected and warned that the current UK trading environment was \u201cvolatile and highly competitive\u201d. Profits for the full year were now expected to be between \u00a355m and \u00a365m \u2013 sharply below City expectations of \u00a383m. The profits warning reignited fears of a grim season on the high street after a more upbeat than anticipated announcement from rival chain Next earlier in the week. Shares in retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Sports Direct fell after rising following the better than expected Next figures on Wednesday. Mothercare, Laura Ashley and Mulberry shares were also dragged down on Thursday. Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct was doubly under scrutiny as it holds a 21% stake in Debenhams and has a number of outlets within the department store chain\u2019s shops. The fall in Debenhams\u2019 share price may prompt speculation of a takeover attempt by Ashley, as part of efforts to move his retail group away from pile-it-high sports gear to more premium clothing lines. New data published on Friday indicates that high street sales fell 2.3% in December, the fifth consecutive year of decline. High street fashion sales were particularly poor, down 3.8% in December to mark the third month of decline according to the latest monthly survey of mid-sized retail chains by advisory firm BDO. In contrast, online sales rose 21.4% with the week up to Christmas Eve recording a near 40% surge as shoppers gain confidence in last minute deliveries, according to BDO. The BDO, Next and Debenhams figures indicate that retailers without a strong online service and a large presence in fading shopping malls and high streets are facing serious difficulties. Debenhams is closing two stores and considering up to eight more as part of chief executive Sergio Bucher\u2019s recovery plan announced earlier this year. Debenhams said it continued to keep its estate under review. Other retailers are also consolidating their store estate including Marks &amp; Spencer and Toys R Us, which is set to close at least 26 stores under an insolvency process finalised before Christmas. American fashion chain Forever 21 is understood to be closing its Dublin and Amsterdam outlets and reviewing its British estate after UK losses ballooned by nearly 75% to \u00a329m in 2016, according to accounts filed at Companies House this week. Bucher said Debenhams was accelerating plans to cut jobs by simplifying its management structures. It will also be stepping up business rates reviews as part of aims to save an extra \u00a310m in costs this year. Bucher said he had faith in his turnaround plan and remained \u201coptimistic about the future of Debenhams\u201d, saying the company had increased sales of beauty and food but had failed to make its seasonal gifts innovative or premium enough to fend off heavy competition and discounting. He said Debenhams had held market share in clothing but the amount shoppers are spending had shrunk amid a warm start to the autumn/winter season, which had led to more discounting than last year. \u201cThe market has been challenging and particularly promotional in some of our key seasonal categories and we have responded in order to remain competitive for our customers, which has impacted our profit performance,\u201d Bucher said. He said the first week of the post-Christmas sale had been \u201cbelow expectations\u201d despite further price cuts, particularly on gifts. Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Debenhams\u2019 problems were not only the result of challenging market conditions and a tough post-Christmas sale. \u201cIn addition we think Debenhams has suffered from having a sub-optimal clothing and gifts offer and from being overly reliant on promotional activity to drive footfall and online spend,\u201d he said. Kate Calvert, an analyst at Investec, said Debenhams faced structural pressures from the shift to online retail which made it difficult to see profits increasing beyond next year. \u201cDebenhams is still a challenged business with too inflexible a cost base and too many unanswered questions over execution and strategy,\u201d she said. \u2022 Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here.",
