The only decent gag in yesterday\u2019s dispatch from Elliott was its lofty line accusing Alliance of resorting \u201cto personal attacks in a manner unbecoming of directors of a public company\u201d. Ho ho. Elliott is a US hedge fund most famous for seizing an Argentinian naval vessel in a dispute over debt. These guys are not softies. They can dish it out, and they can take a personal attack or two. The repetitive nature of the brawl is this: both sides can muster some decent arguments. Elliott is spot on when it says Alliance\u2019s investment performance, under well-remunerated chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox, has been poor to middling. Alliance has underperformed its investment trust sector in five of the past six years \u2013 not by much, but odd percentage points add up over time. On the other side, Alliance makes an understandable grumble when it says Elliott, with a 12% holding, may not be revealing its full hand. Do the Americans really want to be bought out via a tender offer? Do they want Alliance to outsource its fund management to a third party? If either is the case, why not just say so, or take the opportunity to quash suspicions? Instead, the proposal on the table is to elect three new non-executive directors proposed by Elliott \u2013 Anthony Brooke, Peter Chambers and Rory Macnamara. All three have had upstanding City careers and are probably quite capable of injecting some fresh thinking into Alliance\u2019s boardroom. Elliott may also be right that \u201cthey would not countenance being unduly influenced by any particular shareholder.\u201d But one also understands why the average Alliance investor might have doubts on that score. Respect in the City is one thing. Outside the Square Mile, the trio could equally come across as a bunch of stuffed shirts doing the bidding of an aggressive US hedge fund. Brooke, Chambers and Macnamara, if they want to dispel that impression, should find their own voices, rather than let Elliott defend their honour. That means writing to Alliance\u2019s shareholders to explain why they want to join the board. Nobody expects fully formed prescriptions. But it is reasonable to expect a detailed view of the questions Alliance should address and a demonstration, as far as possible, of independence of mind. This is an election and, as with the other one, the voters must hear from the candidates. Speak up, and speak for yourselves, chaps. If not, why should anyone vote for you? Boardroom squeeze? \u201cExecutive pay is no longer increasing and indeed is falling slightly in real terms,\u201d declares PwC, adding: \u201cAt the same time, pay is getting harder to earn \u2026 Remuneration committees are really raising the bar.\u201d It\u2019s a point of view, and one assumes PwC\u2019s remuneration consultants, if pressed, could supply the statistics to support their counter-intuitive conclusion based on only 39 annual reports from FTSE 100 companies. The rest of the world may take some convincing. Two news stories yesterday illustrate why. First, it cost \u00a350m to run the Prudential\u2019s boardroom last year \u2013 that was the combined rewards of eight executive directors (\u00a348.6m) plus nine non-execs (\u00a32m). Even then, the top earner, at \u00a315m, was outside the boardroom \u2013 he is assumed to be Richard Woolnough, M&amp;G\u2019s star bond manager. The Pru has performed wonderfully for shareholders, as noted when Credit Suisse poached its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, and the bumper sums are largely the result of a rising share price inflating the value of past awards. Even so, \u00a350m is a lot. When does PwC think that became normal? The other tale lies in the FTSE 250 index, where Ladbrokes\u2019 Richard Glynn cannot claim Thiam-like popularity with his shareholders. Indeed, after a series of profits warnings, the bookie changed its chief executive last week. Yesterday\u2019s news was Glynn\u2019s payoff. Some features were standard, like a year\u2019s salary (\u00a3580,000) and a year\u2019s pension allowance (\u00a3131,000). But what\u2019s this? Glynn will get \u00a3100,000 for \u201cfailure to grant a performance share award in March 2015\u201d. Eh? He agreed to go at the end of last year, so why would he get a share award three months later? PwC, no doubt, can make sense of it. Gloves are off Sir Ian Cheshire, we thought, had unified the various parts of the Kingfisher DIY empire created by Sir Geoff Mulcahy. But there\u2019s a lot more to do, it seems.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One in every six B&amp;Q stores is to be closed down, with 3,000 jobs put at risk, as a result of a shakeup at the DIY retailer by the new boss of parent company Kingfisher. V\u00e9ronique Laury, who took the helm of Kingfisher in January, announced on Tuesday that she was bringing down the shutters at 60 outlets in an overhaul of the 360-store network which has also resulted in the departure of the head of the UK and Irish B&amp;Q business, Kevin O\u2019Byrne. A day after Kingfisher\u2019s attempted takeover of a French DIY chain collapsed, the FTSE 100 company said the closures would take place over the next two years. A handful of lossmaking stores in mainland Europe will also close. Roughly 3,000 staff in the UK will be affected, but the company said it hoped that half of those would be redeployed in nearby outlets to help improve service. The retailer also plans to offer 900 staff jobs in the company\u2019s Screwfix chain, which opens 60 stores this year. The B&amp;Q closures come after an effort to reduce B&amp;Q\u2019s space by leasing out parts of large stores to rival retailers such as Asda fizzled out. Only eight out of 18 intended deals were finalised. Five months ago B&amp;Q\u2019s rival Homebase blamed the lack of DIY skills in Britain for its decision to close a quarter of its 323 stores over three years. While the housing market is healthy, DIY stores face competition from a growing number of specialist online rivals, such as Toolstation and Victoria Plumb, while consumer habits have also changed markedly since TV shows like Changing Rooms and Ground Force were on primetime TV. DIY has fallen out of fashion, and consumers now prefer to spend their time on leisure activities or buying clothes rather than on painting and wallpapering. The company will be increasing investment in stores by between \u00a350m and \u00a3100m this year. In her first outing as chief executive since taking over from Sir Ian Cheshire, Laury said the group would be undergoing a major overhaul in order to improve efficiency and pass on cost savings that would enable it to cut prices for shoppers and improve service. \u201cThis is not about reducing our scale within the UK, it\u2019s about renewing. I\u2019m not one of those who believes home improvement is dead in the UK. I think its alive for millions of people out there,\u201d said Laury. The changes were announced as Kingfisher announced B&amp;Q\u2019s sales in the UK and Ireland rose 1.9% to \u00a33.8bn while the Screwfix chain, which caters to professional builders, increased sales by over a quarter. Profits in the UK rose 16.2% as a result as underlying sales at B&amp;Q rose 1.4%, the strongest level for five years. Kingfisher said none of the stores marked for closure was unprofitable but it believed profits would improve at its remaining outlets if the chain were trimmed back. Laury said the average house in the UK was 60 years old and so needed to be improved and updated. She insisted B&amp;Q could tap into that market if it offered more original and innovative products and helped younger people who were less likely to have the necessary skills to improve their home. \u201cWe have the choice of leaving them with a crap home and little knowledge or doing something for them. We will be with them helping them to learn or to get them the help they need,\u201d she said. Laury said home improvement remained a market with huge potential in which Kingfisher had a strong position. But she said Kingfisher needed to organise itself in a \u201cvery different\u201d way to unlock that potential. \u201cThis will involve taking what is essentially a locally managed set of businesses and creating instead a single, unified company where customer needs come first. Kingfisher will be reorganised so that a central team coordinates stores across all the countries in which it operates so that they stock more of the same items and look more similar. Kingfisher\u2019s chains, which include Screwfix, B&amp;Q, Castorama, and Brico Depot, currently stock nearly 400,000 different products. Laury said she wanted to cut that dramatically as half of those items accounted for just 2% of sales. The group sells 1,000 different types of glove, for example. She said that it was too early to tell if that would mean that the number of suppliers would also be cut by half. Kingfisher\u2019s profits fell 15% to \u00a3644m in the year to 31 January. Profits were partly hit by adverse currency movements. Total sales increased by 2.9% to \u00a310.97bn.",

      "bodyText": "A last day slide has not prevented European markets from recording a positive three monthly performance. The FTSE 100 has climbed 4.93%, its biggest increase since the three months to March 2013, but it was outshone by the FTSEurofirst 300 - up16% over the quarter, its best first quarter since 1998 - and Germany\u2019s Dax, up 22%. The European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing has been one of the main factors behind the market surge, but the end of the quarter seems to have prompted investors to take profits. Underwhelming eurozone data, continuing worries about Greece, uncertainty over the timing of a US rate rise and another slump in the oil price all combined to take the shine off shares. More here: The closing scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 118.39 points or 1.72% at 6773.04 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.99% to 11,966.17 France\u2019s Cac closed 0.98% lower at 5033.64 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.44% to 23,157.12 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 0.07% down at 11,521.1 The Athens market edged up 0.36% at 775.46 In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 104 points or 0.57% lower. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Greek deposit outflows slowed to \u20ac3bn in March, according to a Bloomberg report: The outflow brings net withdrawals in four months to about \u20ac28bn, cutting the deposit total to about \u20ac137bn, the lowest in more than 10 years. ECB policy makers hold a weekly review on Wednesday of their Emergency Liquidity Assistance, which is keeping Greek lenders afloat, according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Last week it made more than 1 billion euros available, raising the limit to just over \u20ac71bn. \u201cGreece is being kept on an incredibly tight leash,\u201d Michala Marcussen, global head of economics at Societe Generale SA, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. It\u2019s \u201cclearly intended to keep Greece under pressure and keep things moving forward in the negotiations.\u201d Full story here: Greek Deposit Outflows Said to Slow to 3 Billion Euros Portugal will benefit from its structural reforms and accelerating economic growth in the years ahead, but its large debt burden remains a challenge, ratings agency Moody\u2019s has said in its annual analysis of the county: \u201cWe expect Portugal\u2019s real economic growth to accelerate to 1.7% and 1.8% in 2015 and 2016, respectively, from 0.9% in 2014, on the back of stronger domestic demand and renewed strength in exports. The implementation of broad structural reforms over the past several years should support a stronger economic growth path, while fiscal consolidation measures will help gradually reduce the country\u2019s debt burden. However, Portugal\u2019s debt levels still remain very high,\u201d says Kathrin Muehlbronner, a vice president -senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s. US consumers are becoming increasing confident, according to the latest conference board survey. The March consumer confidence index came in at 101.3, better than the 96 figure expected by economists. This was up from a February figure of 98.8, itself revised up from 96.4. Stock markets have been enjoying a good first quarter, not least thanks to the start (at last) of the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme. But March is ending on a downbeat note, with a spate of profit taking hitting Wall Street, which had just opened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 263 points on Monday, is currently down around 119 points. Investors in Europe are also taking a breather, with Germany\u2019s Dax down around 94 points. News that the Greek talks with its creditors had broken up has not helped matters. In the UK the FTSE 100 is down 113 points, with commodity companies under pressure as oil slid again (on the prospect of increased supplies from Iran if the nuclear negotiations come to a conclusion shortly). There was also a bit of pre-election jitters after the campaign began in earnest after Monday\u2019s dissolution of Parliament. Still, the FTSE 100 has enjoyed its best three month stretch since March 2013 while the FTSEurofirst 300 has seen its best first quarter since 1998. Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande are giving a press conference in Berlin now. The two leaders say France and Germany have come closer in recent months, as they face terrorism in Paris and the Germanwings disaster together. They then fielded questions on Greece. Merkel said she wasn\u2019t worried that Tsipras is heading to Russia next week. And the chancellor is still optimistic that an economic reform plan will be agreed, but won\u2019t be lured into setting a deadline: Hollande added that \u201ctoo much time\u201d has been lost already, so reforms need to be settled as fast as possible. Time for a recap. Hopes of an breakthrough between Greece and its creditors before the Easter break are fading today. After three days of negotiations over reform plans, Greek officials are heading back from Brussels to Athens without a breakthrough. European Council president Donald Tusk has predicted that it could take until the end of April for Greece to satisfy its lenders that it has a credible economic programme. Until then, the government must struggle on without bailout funding. Greek officials are remaining upbeat, telling us that sessions took place in a \u201cvery good climate\u201d, adding: \u201cBoth sides agreed that the process of fact-finding currently underway in Athens should be intensified.\u201d But without any new bailout funds, Athens faces a struggle to meet debt repayments including the \u20ac450m owed to the IMF on April 9th. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are predicting a long haul: Prime minister Alexis Tsipras has also made fresh overtures towards Moscow, telling the TASS newswire that \u201cGreece, as an EU member state, can be a link, a bridge between the West and Russia.\u201d Tsipras also reiterated that his government don\u2019t agree with the sanctions imposed on Russia over the Ukraine crisis [Bloomberg has more details]. While in Germany, one of Angela Merkel\u2019s allies has resigned in protest at Greece\u2019s bailouts. In other news... Eurozone unemployment was higher than expected last month, with 11.4% of adults classed as jobless. Prices across the eurozone continued to fall in March, with the consumer prices index falling by 0.1%. Core inflation dipped to 0.6%, suggesting price pressures remain weak. But Britain\u2019s economy is stronger than expected; the ONS has revised up its growth estimate for the last quarter of 2014 to 0.6%, from 0.5%. Greek Euro parliamentarians are also expressing confidence that an agreement will be found in time, adds our correspondent Helena Smith in Athens. Drawn-out negotiations were part of the horse-trading to be expected in any negotiation, they say. Stelios Koulouglou, Syriza MEP, told the Guardian: \u201cThe government has to be tough to reach a workable compromise. I am actually quite optimistic.\u201d That seems to chime with what prime ministerial aides are saying today. Vehemently denying that there was discord within the Greek representation, officials insisted that progress had been made in the negotiations. One insider said: \u201cThe Greek side has well-founded positions ... in quite a few instances these positions have been accepted, while in others there are disagreements\u201d. The reforms leaked to the press had indeed been presented to creditor institutions but \u201cdo not express them in their entirety,\u201d the aides said. There were many more that had been put forward in far greater detail, they added. That chimes with what the Greek media (usually well briefed in such matters) has been murmuring in recent days. Ta Nea today has a double-page spread headlined: \u201cThe list\u2019s visible and secret measures.\u201d The daily lists 24 proposed reforms - six more than those announced by the government last week. Over in Athens, officials are putting on a brave face on the situation, as technical team heads back from Brussels (see earlier post). They say that despite the seeming lack of progress, talks were held in a \u201cvery good climate,\u201d our correspondent Helena Smith reports. One well-placed official said: \u201cThe sessions took place in a very good climate with a mutual desire for an agreement to succeed. Greek representatives had the opportunity to present the list of reforms that the Greek government had prepared at length,\u201d The Greek side also had the opportunity to provide \u201cclarification\u201d to queries creditor institutions had over the workability of the reforms, the official added. \u201cBoth sides agreed that the process of fact-finding currently underway in Athens should be intensified.\u201d While there was a desire for a compromise to be found as soon as possible, prime minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 leftist-led government had made clear any deal would not include recessionary measures but should be aimed at \u201ckickstarting the economy.\u201d HS Money continues to flow out of shares today, and into safe-havens such as German debt. The price of Germany\u2019s two-year bonds has hit a new all-time high, pushing down the yield (the rate of return on the bond) below -0.25%. That means investors are paying more than the face value of the debt, and accepting they will make a loss when it matures (unless they sell it to someone else at an even higher price!). The FTSE 100, though, is showing a triple-digit loss -- down 104 points or 1.5% at 6787. A senior member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Conservative bloc has resigned from his parliamentary seat, saying he cannot support the chancellor\u2019s handling of the Greek debt crisis. Peter Gauweiler also quit the vice-presidency of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) party, which is allied with Merkel\u2019s CDU party. Gauweiler said he was stepping down because: \u201cI have been publicly pressured to vote in the Bundestag for the exact opposite, on the grounds that I am a vice-president,\u201d \u201cThis is incompatible with my interpretation of the duty of a legislator.\u201d Gauweiler\u2019s departure may be politically awkward for Merkel, but we should note that he has opposed Europe\u2019s handling of its debt crisis for some years. AFP dub him \u201ca well-known eurosceptic and outspoken critic of euro bailout funds\u201d. He has led several legal challenges against eurozone bailouts, including challenging the ECB\u2019s OMT bond-buying programme which helped \u00e7alm the crisis in 2012. Officials in Athens remain optimistic that a deal over Greece\u2019s reform plans can be reached soon, according to Greek journalist Efi Egthimiou. The European Commission insist that negotiations with Greece have certainly not ended permanently. EC spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told reporters in Brussels that talks with Greek officials are still \u2018ongoing\u2019 (even as they head back to Athens): She said: \u201cThe constructive talks are ongoing since Friday, but we are not there yet, so this is why the talks should continue. The Eurogroup working group will discuss the matter at its next meeting.\u201d That working group (made up of deputy finance ministers) is due to hold a teleconference call on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the state of play: The technical negotiations between Greece and its creditors in Brussels have ended, it appears, without agreement on the country\u2019s reform plan. Greek insiders, though, say that progress has been made - although slowly - and talks could restart next week. Reuters has the details: Talks between officials from Greece and its EU/IMF lenders in Brussels have ended without a deal on the country\u2019s reform plans and may continue next week, three Greek government officials said on Tuesday. A fourth source close to the talks said the halt in negotiations was not a sign of a rupture but an indication of slow-moving progress in the discussions, which may be continued in Athens on Wednesday. \u201cThe Brussels Group process has been concluded,\u201d one of the government officials said, referring to the informal name of the EU/IMF lenders. \u201cSignificant steps of progress were made. The technical teams will continue to collect data in Athens.\u201d Greek TV station TVXS has also heard that an agreement is close (which might come as news to Donald Tusk!) The lack of agreement has hit European stock markets, with all the main indices now in the red. Back to the looming issue of Greece..... and European Council president Donald Tusk has warned that an agreement is unlikely before the Easter break, but could come by the end of April. Speaking in Madrid, Tusk explained that the technical talks over Greece\u2019s economic reforms are very complex, and thus: I don\u2019t foresee any breakthough before Easter. The situation in Greece is under control at present, Tusk said, and declined to speculate on any \u201cPlan B\u201d. We are focused on a successful financial deal for Greece, under the conditions agreed on 20 February, he added. Here\u2019s a video clip of Tusk speaking: Here\u2019s my colleague Katie Allen\u2019s take on today\u2019s UK GDP report: The UK economy grew faster than expected in the final months of last year, helped by a long-awaited rise in exports, according to new official figures. In a welcome boost to the Conservatives ahead of May\u2019s election, GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2014 was revised to 0.6%, up from a previous estimate of 0.5% and matching the pace of expansion in the third quarter. For the year as a whole, growth was upgraded to 2.8%, from 2.6%, and was the fastest expansion since 2006. The Office for National Statistics said growth in real household disposable income also picked up while net trade moved from being a drag on the economy in the third quarter to boosting growth. However, business investment fell 0.9% on the quarter, casting doubts over the outlook for growth. There were also signs that households are dipping into savings to fuel spending, as the savings ratio dropped to 5.8% in the fourth quarter from 5.9% in the third quarter.... The pound has jumped against the euro since this morning\u2019s flurry of data was announced. Sterling is up around one eurocent at \u20ac1.377, a one-week high, as traders learn that UK growth was faster than expected in the last quarter. The euro, though, has been hit by the news the unemployment was higher than expected, at 11.3%. And there is concern that the eurozone\u2019s \u2018core inflation\u2019 (stripping out volatile elements like energy), fell to 0.6% this month. It\u2019s been a rough three months for the euro. The chancellor didn\u2019t waste any time reacting to the new growth figures: Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC, suggests that the UK might be the fastest growing advanced economy this year, as in 2014. Here\u2019s his take on the new growth data: \u201cIt is not surprising to see GDP being revised up for Q4 and for 2014 as a whole. A whole raft of other data points to a strong year for the British economy - including business surveys, car sales, retail sales and falling unemployment. \u201cThe other encouraging thing about these figures is that they show that growth is being led by investment and exports - both of which rose by over 5% year-on-year in the final quarter of last year. Exports of services are also growing at over 5% with export-oriented services industries at the leading edge of the UK economic recovery. That is supported by the strong growth we are seeing in professional and business services - the strongest growing sector in the UK economy last year. \u201cThe UK economy now appears to have more momentum going into 2015 than we earlier thought. So we should expect GDP forecasts for this year to be revised upwards on the back of this data. It is still entirely possible that the UK will head the G7 growth league in 2015, as we did last year.\u201d Kit Juckes of French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is alarmed to see Britain\u2019s current account deficit hitting a record high, at 5.5% of GDP. He writes: Trade balance improved, but the investment income balance didn\u2019t. The regional current account deficit with the EU (\u00a328.3bn) is particularly ugly. It\u2019s going to take years to turn these trend round, which are born of low investment returns in Europe vs the UK and the long-term erosion of the overall net foreign asset position of the UK. Needless to say, such a big balance of payments hole is unhelpful at a time of political uncertainty, reflective of a country living beyond its means and really scary if the UK, or global economies were to slow sharply..... Not that it\u2019s a new trend.... Here\u2019s some early expert reaction to today\u2019s UK GDP report Here\u2019s a great chart showing unemployment in some of the eurozone\u2019s larger economies over the last 25 years. The Eurozone\u2019s jobless rate was 11.3% in February, the lowest since May 2012 -- but also worse than expected. Eurostat reports that unemployment across the euro area fell from 11.4% in January -- having revised up its previous estimate of 11.2%. Unemployment across the wider EU dipped to 9.8% in February 2015, down from 9.9% in January 2015 and from 10.5% in February 2014. According to Eurostat, the number of people unemployed in the euro area fell by 49,000 meaning 18.204m were out of work. And, as usual, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in Germany (4.8%) and Austria (5.3%), and the highest in Greece (26.0% in December 2014) and Spain (23.2%). Just in: Prices across the eurozone fell by 0.1% this month, up from -0.3% in February. Once again, falling energy prices dragged down the cost of living, while service sector and food costs are rising. Eurostat explains: Services is expected to have the highest annual rate in March (1.0%, compared with 1.2% in February), followed by food, alcohol &amp; tobacco (0.6%, compared with 0.5% in February), non-energy industrial goods (-0.1%, stable compared with February) and energy (-5.8%, compared with -7.9% in February). Some political context: Britain\u2019s current account is not for the faint-hearted. The deficit in Britain\u2019s trade and overseas investments has hit 5.5% of GDP, which is the largest deficit since records began in 1948. So despite the recovery, the UK continues to import more than it exports, and is struggling to cover the gap with \u2018invisible earnings\u2019 and income from the assets it controls abroad.. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, wrote recently about why this is such a concern: One note of caution, the UK economy is still effectively smaller than before the financial crisis struck, once you adjust for population changes. So we\u2019re individually worse of than before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The Conservative Party must be cheering the news that growth was a little faster than previously thought in the last quarter: Britain\u2019s service sector led the way in the last quarter, with growth of 0.9%. Industrial production rose by 0.2%, while construction output shrank by 2.2%. Breaking: The UK economy grew by 0.6% in the last three months of 2014, higher than the 0.5% previously estimated. The Office for National Statistics has also revised up its estimate for year-on-year GDP growth to 3.0%, up from 2.7%. In addition, the ONS has also upped its estimate for GDP growth during 2014 as a whole, from 2.6% to 2.8% -- that\u2019s the highest since 2006. And it means UK GDP is now 3.7% above its pre-crisis peak, before the financial crisis. European stock markets are on track for their strongest quarterly growth in many years, despite Greece\u2019s debt problems. The launch of the ECB\u2019s quantitative easing programme has helped fuel a remarkable stock market rally. Germany\u2019s DAX has surged by 23% during 2015, which we think is the biggest quarterly jump since 2003. The Italian FTSE MIB is close behind, up 22% despite the weakness of the Italian economy. The wider FTSEurofirst 300, covering the biggest 300 companies across Europe, has gained almost 17% since the start of January. That\u2019s the best first-quarter performance in 17 years. The rally hasn\u2019t been confined to Europe either. China\u2019s stocks has been on an absolute tear, with more retail investors flocking to the market. More than a million new share-dealing accounts were opened last week alone in China. As Chris Weston of IG comments: This is a sentiment driven market and when you see a record 1.14 million new A-share accounts last week you know that rampant speculation is underway. (note: this graph is priced in US dollars, which dampens the size of Europe\u2019s rally) Hopes that Italy\u2019s economy was healing have just taken a knock. Italy\u2019s unemployment rate jumped to 12.7% in February, from 12.6% in January, new data shows. And the youth unemployment rate has spiked too, to 42.6% from 41.2% in January. That\u2019s disappointing, given recent signs that Italian consumer confidence was rising after several years of recession or stagnation. Just in: Germany\u2019s unemployment rate has hit a new all-time low of 6.4%, as Europe\u2019s largest economy continues to recover. The seasonally adjusted jobless total has fallen by 15,000 this month, down to 2.798m. A bigger fall than expected. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, confirms that the lack of progress over Greece\u2019s economic reforms is hurting the euro today. He writes: Last night showed us that the Greek government and the European architects of Greece\u2019s bailout program remain very far apart on what needs to be, and can be done for the former\u2019s economy. On every agenda item of what the austerity and bailout program needs, Greece disagrees. The program calls for a VAT increase on the tourism sector, the Greek government has said no. Pension reform has been shot down and public sector wages will remain protected. The wider effect is that the budget surplus \u2013 the difference between what the government is spending and what it is receiving in the form of tax revenues \u2013 should be 3% of GDP in this year and 4% next year according to the program. Greece says they can do 1.5%. Veteran investor Mark Mobius has offered Greece some much-needed solidarity today. Mobius, who runs Templeton\u2019s emerging markets fund, told Greek financial daily Naftemporik that: \u201cGreece will stay in the euro zone, there is no issue.....The stock market is cheap and we are buyers.\u201d Good news for the town of Swindon this morning \u2013 Japanese automaker Honda has announced a \u00a3200m upgrade to its car plant. That means Swindon will be ready to produce the next-generation five-door Civic, calming fears over the factory\u2019s future. In the UK, Kingfisher has announced it will close around 60 B&amp;Q stores as new CEO V\u00e9ronique Laury implements her plans for the company. Laury is speaking to reporters now, saying she hopes the impact on jobs will be \u2018neutral\u2019; some workers can be redeployed, with Kingfisher also opening more Screwfix outlets. A few loss-making stores in Europe are also being shut. Karen Witts, chief financial officer, warned that the French market (which Laury used to run) remains tough: \u201cIn the short term, whilst we remain encouraged by the improving economic backdrop in the UK, we remain cautious on the outlook for France, our biggest market.\u201d The City likes the plan -- Kingfishers shares have jumped by 4.5% in early trading. Russia\u2019s TASS news agency is running quotes from Alexis Tsipras, saying that Greece opposes the sanctions imposed on Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. Bloomberg have picked them up too: It\u2019s another reason to be cautious about the euro, suggests Ilya Spivak, Global Macro Strategist at DailyFX.com. The euro is likely to keep falling, thanks to Greece\u2019s debt problems and the ECB\u2019s new stimulus package. That\u2019s according to Shusuke Yamada, a Tokyo-based currency strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who told Bloomberg that: \u201cMarkets are becoming more sensitive to the Greek issue. In addition, the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing is keeping downward pressure on the euro. Fundamentals point to euro selling.\u201d The euro has fallen back this morning after Greece failed to agree a package of economic reforms with its lenders on Monday, as hoped. The single currency has fallen half a cent against the US dollar, hitting $1.078, as traders reacted to last night\u2019s events in the Athens parliament, and the prospect of more deadlock ahead. As we covered in last night\u2019s liveblog, prime minister Alexis Tsipras insisted that he would not unconditionally surrender to Greece\u2019s creditors. He declared: It is true that we are seeking an honest compromise with our lenders but don\u2019t expect an unconditional agreement from us.\u201d Tsipras vowed to stop \u2018the bleeding\u2019 in Greece, and repeatedly argued that the country needs a new debt restructuring deal. Greece has a simple choice, he argued, between surrendering, or changing the policies that have caused such economic misery. He pledged to end the \u2018pillaging\u2019 of the middle classes, and revealed that a new clampdown on unpaid taxes had already delivered \u20ac100m. But his speech lacked clear details about the reform plan that Greece is putting together in negotiations with its creditors over the last few days. Tsipras also urged opposition politicians to back him, but was criticised by former PM Antonis Samara for damaging Greece\u2019s relations with the rest of Europe and threatening the recovery. Analysts fear that Greece will run out of cash this month unless it receives a cash injection from its lenders. As Jonathan Sudaria of Capital Spreads puts it: \u201cThe brinkmanship continues as both sides continue to stare at each other over the political void. Despite Greece hurtling towards bankruptcy, an agreement continues to evade.\u201d Ian Williams of Peel Hunt agrees, saying: The euro is under renewed pressure on persistent concerns about Greece. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. There\u2019s a lot of talk at present that Europe\u2019s economy is healing, and we\u2019ll get a proper healthcheck today with new inflation data for this month, and the February unemployment report, both at 10am BST. Economists predict that eurozone prices fell by just 0.1% year-on-year, an improvement on February\u2019s 0.3% decline. If so, this period of negative inflation (or \u201cDEFLATION!!\u201d if you have alarmist tendencies) may be ending, now oil prices appear to have stabilised. The eurozone jobless rate, though, is expected to hover around 11.2%, around twice the level in the UK and US. And we\u2019ll probably see the usual sharp regional differences, with Germany\u2019s economy improving and Italy lagging behind. We also get the third estimate of UK GDP for the fourth quarter of last year, probably confirming that growth slowed to 0.5%. There\u2019ll also be new details of how the economy fared during the quarter. That\u2019s at 9.30am BST. And overshadowing everything is Greece, which has still to agree a programme of economic reforms with its creditors. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day....",

A whole raft of other data points to a strong year for the British economy - including business surveys, car sales, retail sales and falling unemployment.</p> <p>\u201cThe other encouraging thing about these figures is that they show that growth is being led by investment and exports - both of which rose by over 5% year-on-year in the final quarter of last year. Exports of services are also growing at over 5% with export-oriented services industries at the leading edge of the UK economic recovery. That is supported by the strong growth we are seeing in professional and business services - the strongest growing sector in the UK economy last year.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK economy now appears to have more momentum going into 2015 than we earlier thought. So we should expect GDP forecasts for this year to be revised upwards on the back of this data. It is still entirely possible that the UK will head the G7 growth league in 2015, as we did last year.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-551a66c4e4b0cf3775a2c8a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-03-31T09:25:07.107Z\">10.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Kit Juckes of French bank </strong><strong>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</strong><strong> is alarmed to see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/mar/31/euro-falls-greek-progress-unemployment-inflation-live-updates#block-551a6010e4b0cb1d18f95a8d\">Britain\u2019s current account deficit hitting a record high, at 5.5% of GDP</a>.</strong></p> <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trade balance improved, but the investment income balance didn\u2019t.

If so, this period of negative inflation (<em>or \u201cDEFLATION!!\u201d if you have alarmist tendencies</em>) may be ending, now oil prices appear to have stabilised.</p> <p>The eurozone jobless rate, though, is expected to hover around 11.2%, around twice the level in the UK and US.

There\u2019ll also be new details of how the economy fared during the quarter.

      "bodyText": "Living standards have been thrust to the centre of the general election campaign as official figures showed Britain is undergoing the slowest recovery since the 1920s and GDP per head still remains lower than levels before the recession. Labour has accused the Conservatives of complacency on the grounds that people are still worse off after the Office for National Statistics showed GDP per head remains 1.2% below pre-economic downturn levels. But George Osborne, the chancellor, hailed \u201ca hat-trick of good news\u201d after figures from the ONS showed the UK economy grew faster than expected in the final months of last year and consumer confidence has risen to its highest level in 12 years. The figures also showed that real household disposable income has nudged ahead to stand 0.19% higher than the level inherited by the coalition in May 2010. Labour and the Tories clashed on the economy after the ONS figures provided armoury for both campaigns. The Tories welcomed the figures, which show that GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2014 was revised to 0.6%, up from a previous estimate of 0.5% and matching the pace of expansion in the third quarter. For the year as a whole, growth was upgraded to 2.8%, from 2.6%, and was the fastest expansion since 2006. Osborne said: \u201cToday we\u2019ve got a hat-trick of good news about the British economy and with 37 days to go the election it\u2019s another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a significant upgrade to GDP, the highest consumer confidence for over 12 years and confirmation that living standards are higher than they were at the last election. This is good news for families and businesses across the country.\u201d But Labour highlighted figures showing that GDP per head growth has been slower than overall economic growth, helping to explain why many people do not consider their living standards to be noticeably improving. The ONS said GDP per head increased by 0.5% between the third and fourth quarters and was up 2.2% for the year as a whole. It remains 1.2% below pre-economic downturn levels. Statisticians also said net national disposable income (NNDI) per head, which represents the income available to UK residents, had remained broadly flat since the start of 2012 and remained 5.1% below pre-downturn levels. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said the Tories were wrongly telling voters they have \u201cnever had it so good\u201d even though Britain is experiencing the slowest recovery in a century. Speaking during a campaign visit to Swindon, Balls said: \u201cThis is a government which has presided over five years when wages have not kept pace with rising prices and family bills. \u201cGeorge Osborne and David Cameron want to spend the next six weeks going round the country saying you are better off. I say \u2018bring it on\u2019 because working people are really struggling in our country and we can do better than this.\u201d The slight improvement in Britain\u2019s economic growth was helped in part by a long-awaited rise in exports, according to new official figures. Quarterly growth and levels of GDP The ONS said net trade moved from being a drag on the economy in the third quarter to boosting growth while the services sector continued to power the economy. However, business investment fell 0.9% on the quarter, casting doubts over the outlook for growth. There were also signs that households are dipping into savings to fuel spending, as the savings ratio dropped to 5.8% in the fourth quarter from 5.9% in the third quarter. \u201cIt was encouraging to see a marked pickup in exports while consumer spending was solid,\u201d said Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight. \u201cBut the marked relapse in business investment was disappointing. Healthy business investment is vital if the UK is to significantly lift productivity and generate sustainable balanced growth.\u201d Rebalancing worries The British Chambers of Commerce expressed concern about a failure to rebalance the UK economy, despite plans by the coalition government to boost exports and reduce dependence on consumer spending. The ONS figures showed all parts of the economy except the dominant services sector, remained below their pre-crisis levels. David Kern, chief economist at the BCC, said while the upgrade in growth was positive, some of the details \u201chighlight the need to shift our economy towards a more sustainable model\u201d. \u201cAs in recent quarters, services and consumer spending were the main drivers of the economy. But while a healthy consumer sector is vital to the UK economy, it is clear we need a greater contribution from exports and investment. It is therefore concerning that business investment fell last quarter and the current account deficit remains unacceptably large, despite slight improvements in the trade balance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next government must do more to back long-term business investment and support British exporters.\u201d Record current account deficit The latest estimates of the UK\u2019s overall trading position from the ONS showed it improved in the final quarter but was the worst on record for the year as a whole. The current account deficit \u2013 made up of the trade deficit, plus losses on overseas ventures \u2013 narrowed as a percentage of the economy to 5.6% in the final three months of 2014 from 6.1% in the third quarter. At \u00a325.3bn it was still higher than a forecast of \u00a321.5bn in a Reuters poll of economists. For the whole year the gap was 5.5% of GDP, the largest annual deficit since records began in 1948. Vicky Redwood at Capital Economics said the large current account deficit \u201ccasts something of a cloud over the figures\u201d. \u201cMost people had hoped the deficit would narrow a lot more than this due to a shrinking of the investment income deficit, but in fact the latter remained pretty big,\u201d said Redwood, chief UK economist at the thinktank. \u201cNonetheless, the latest economic news suggest that growth has picked up again since the start of the year ... We still expect solid GDP growth this year of 3%.\u201d",

Analyst Eoin Lambe said the market was undervaluing the company\u2019s set top box business, despite fears the business was being overtaken by new technology such as streaming services. He said: Pace\u2019s core set-top box market is ex-growth but it won\u2019t completely disappear.

As well as the China concerns, the continuing fall in the oil price is also hitting the sector, with Brent crude down 1.7% at $55.33 a barrel as the deadline for nuclear agreement with Iran approaches.

Consumer demand is waning and it\u2019s the aspirational or luxury brands that will be left most exposed. Furthermore, this round of stimulus from Beijing may have fallen short of expectations.</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere engineering group <strong>Meggitt</strong> is down 13.5p at 549.5p as Exane BNP Paribas began coverage with an underperform rating and 475p price target. The bank said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Buoyed by bid speculation, the company has outperformed this past 12 months and trades close to its relative highs. However we don\u2019t believe that the group\u2019s earnings quality and increasing pressure on an already weak cash conversion support a takeout above the current price. We see a future where investment continues to rise, impacting cash generation, without sufficient offset from accelerating organic sales growth. An ending/slowing of the share buyback programme could be a catalyst for underperformance. </p> </blockquote> <p>But B&amp;Q owner <strong>Kingfisher</strong> has climbed 16.3p to 381.1p as it announced plans to return \u00a3200m to shareholders and shut 60 underperforming UK stores.</p> <p>Among the mid-caps, <strong>Mitie</strong> has dropped more than 6% to 273.7p after the outsourcing group said full year profits were likely to be lower than expected, due to cuts in local government spending on home care and social housing. </p>",

Meanwhile concerns about Chinese consumer spending has hit the likes of Burberry, down 18p at \u00a317.54, and Imperial Tobacco, 39p lower at \u00a330.29. Mining shares are also weaker, with Anglo American down 21p at \u00a310.39 and Rio Tinto off 9p at 2807.5p. As well as the China concerns, the continuing fall in the oil price is also hitting the sector, with Brent crude down 1.7% at $55.33 a barrel as the deadline for nuclear agreement with Iran approaches. If a deal is agreed, further supplies of oil are likely to come onto the market, putting further pressure on prices. An exception to the mining sector decline is Antofagasta, up 1.5p at 741p despite the copper miner denying reports it was in merger talks with Vancour-based Teck Resources. Citigroup said: Our initial reaction to any potential deal is puzzlement, seeing no obvious benefits to Antofagasta. Operating synergies would be relatively small. Strategically we see no benefits to Antofagasta\u2019s minority shareholders from diversification into coal and zinc (although this does hinge on long-term prices); plus risk of a major de-rating risk from losing the pure-play copper premium. The only good rationale would be if [Antofagasta\u2019s copper mine] Los Pelambres really is at risk (in which case Teck would walk). Overall the FTSE 100 is down 13.07 points at 6878.36, even though UK GDP numbers came in better than expected. Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, said: Burberry, BAT and Imperial Tobacco are all struggling and given news of the Chinese stimulus measures released overnight with the easing of mortgage rules, there could well be some read across here. Consumer demand is waning and it\u2019s the aspirational or luxury brands that will be left most exposed. Furthermore, this round of stimulus from Beijing may have fallen short of expectations. Elsewhere engineering group Meggitt is down 13.5p at 549.5p as Exane BNP Paribas began coverage with an underperform rating and 475p price target. The bank said: Buoyed by bid speculation, the company has outperformed this past 12 months and trades close to its relative highs. However we don\u2019t believe that the group\u2019s earnings quality and increasing pressure on an already weak cash conversion support a takeout above the current price. We see a future where investment continues to rise, impacting cash generation, without sufficient offset from accelerating organic sales growth. An ending/slowing of the share buyback programme could be a catalyst for underperformance. But B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher has climbed 16.3p to 381.1p as it announced plans to return \u00a3200m to shareholders and shut 60 underperforming UK stores. Among the mid-caps, Mitie has dropped more than 6% to 273.7p after the outsourcing group said full year profits were likely to be lower than expected, due to cuts in local government spending on home care and social housing.",

      "bodyText": "A review of Australia\u2019s competition laws has called for pharmacy regulations to be pared back, the full deregulation of retail trading hours and the removal of import restrictions on books and secondhand cars. The final report of the Coalition-commissioned review also called on the government to reform a \u201cdeficient\u201d section of the Competition and Consumer Act dealing with companies that misuse their market power. A further review of taxi regulation was placed on the agenda, but the report stopped short of backing some Coalition politicians\u2019 calls for changes to prevent environmental groups campaigning for boycotts against particular companies. Professor Ian Harper, the economist who headed the review, said the 56 recommendations were \u201cthe result of widespread consultation\u201d and aimed to reinvigorate competition to encourage innovation and improve productivity. The recommendation about pharmacy regulation comes at a sensitive time for the government, which is negotiating the next community pharmacy agreement. A recent audit report found major problems with the administration of the previous agreement, reached in 2010. The Harper report, published on Tuesday, called for the removal of restrictions on the ownership and location of pharmacies because they were \u201cnot needed to ensure the quality of advice and care provided to patients\u201d. \u201cNegotiations on the next community pharmacy agreement offer an opportunity for the Australian government to implement a further targeted relaxation of the location rules, as part of a transition towards their eventual removal,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf changes during the initial years of the new agreement prove too precipitate, there should be provision for a mid-term review to incorporate easing of the location rules later in the life of the next Community Pharmacy Agreement.\u201d More broadly, the report called for the remaining restrictions on retail trading hours to be removed. Such restrictions vary across the states and territories. \u201cTo the extent that jurisdictions choose to retain restrictions, these should be strictly limited to Christmas Day, Good Friday and the morning of Anzac Day, and should be applied broadly to avoid discriminating among different types of retailers,\u201d the report said. \u201cDeregulating trading hours should not prevent jurisdictions from imposing specific restrictions on trading times for alcohol retailing or gambling services in order to achieve the policy objective of harm minimisation.\u201d The report also called for changes to parallel import restrictions which \u201cbenefit local producers by shielding them from international competition\u201d. It suggested such restrictions could be easily circumvented, pointing to rising online book sales. The report called for the restrictions to be removed unless the benefits \u201cto the community as a whole\u201d outweighed the costs. It also called for urgent review of regulation of the taxi industry, noting the rise of ride-sharing services such as Uber. \u201cRegulation of taxi and hire car services should be focused on ensuring minimum standards for the benefit of consumers rather than on restricting competition or supporting a particular business model,\u201d the report said. The small business minister, Bruce Billson, said the federal government would spend up to 10 weeks consulting on the recommendations before mapping out a way forward. These talks would include the state and territory governments. The report rebuffed calls for an amendment to \u201csecondary boycott\u201d provisions. At present, an exemption allows groups to campaign against companies based on environmental or consumer protection grounds. \u201cThe panel did not receive compelling evidence of actual secondary boycott activity falling within the environmental and consumer protection exception,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn the absence of such evidence, the panel does not see an immediate case for amending the exception. However, if such evidence arises from future boycott activity, the exceptions should be reassessed.\u201d The report backed the existing \u201cunconscionable conduct\u201d provisions that were cited in recent Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) actions against Coles regarding its dealings with suppliers. It said such cases indicated the rules were working as intended, but they should be reviewed if any deficiencies became evident. The report called for changes to \u201cprice signalling\u201d rules, which prevent the private disclosure of pricing information to a competitor. These prohibitions apply only to banking services at present. It called for prohibitions against cartel conduct to be simplified, arguing the \u201cexcessively complex\u201d rules undermined compliance and enforcement.",
