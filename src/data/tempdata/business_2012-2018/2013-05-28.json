    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European leaders warned on Tuesday that youth unemployment \u2013 which exceeds 50% in some countries \u2013 could lead to a continent-wide catastrophe and widespread social unrest aimed at member state governments. The French, German and Italian governments joined forces to launch initiatives to \"rescue an entire generation\" who fear they will never find jobs. More than 7.5 million young Europeans aged between 15 and 24 are not in employment, education or training, according to EU data. The rate of youth unemployment is more than double that for adults, and more than half of young people in Greece (59%) and Spain (55%) are unemployed. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, dubbed them the \"post-crisis generation\", who will \"for ever after, be holding today's governments responsible for their plight\". \"Remember the postwar generation, my generation. Europe showed us and gave us the support we needed, the hope we cherished. The hopes that we could get a job after finishing school, and succeed in life,\" he said at conference in Paris. \"Can we be responsible for depriving today's young generation of this kind of hope?\" . We're talking about a complete breakdown of identifying with Europe. \"Imagine all of the hatred, the anger\"What's really at stake here is, not just 'Let's punish those in power'. No. Citizens are turning their backs on Europe and the construction of the European project. Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, warned that unless Europe tackled youth employment, which stands at 23.5% across the EU, the continent \"will lose the battle for Europe's unity\". Italy's labour minister, Enrico Giovanni, said European leaders needed to work together to \"rescue an entire generation of people who are scared [they will never find work]. \"We have the best ever educated generation in this continent, and we are putting them on hold,\" he said. The UK Department for Work and Pensions and the Treasury were unable to say why Britain, which has a 20.7% rate of youth unemployment, was not represented at the conference in Paris on Tuesday. Stephen Timms, shadow employment minister, attacked the coalition for remaining \"utterly silent on youth unemployment\". \"This government has totally failed to tackle Britain's youth jobs crisis. This government must stop sitting on the sidelines and take the urgent action we need to get young people back to work.\" Hollande outlined a series of measures to tackle the problem, including a \"youth guarantee\" to promise everyone under 25 a job, further education or training. The plan, which has been discussed by the European commission, will be supported by \u20ac6bn (\u00a35bn) of EU cash over the next five years. Another \u20ac16bn in European structural funds is also set aside for youth employment projects. Herman Van Rompuy, European council president, pledged to put the \"fight against unemployment high on our agenda\" at the next EU summit in June. \"We must rise to the expectations of the millions of young people who expect political action,\" he said. The commission estimates youth joblessness costs the EU \u20ac153bn in unemployment benefit, lost productivity and lost tax revenue. \"In addition, for young people themselves, being unemployed at a young age can have a long-lasting negative 'scarring effect',\" the commission said. \"These young people face not only higher risks of future unemployment, but also higher risks of exclusion, of poverty and of health problems.\" The European ministers, who will meet German chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the youth unemployment crisis in July, said small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) will form a central plank of the plans. SMEs traditionally employ the vast majority of young people, but have complained they haven't been able to borrow enough money to grow since the financial crisis struck in 2008. Ursula von der Leyen, Germany's labour minister, said: \"Many SMEs, which are the backbone of our economies, are ready to produce but need capital, or they have to pay exorbitant borrowing rates.\" The minsters are working on establishing a special credit line for SMEs from the European Investment Bank (EIB), which will have a \u20ac70bn lending capacity this year. However, Werner Hoyer, head of the EIB, warned minister not have \"expectations completely over the horizon\". \"Let's be honest, there is no quick fix, there is no grand plan,\" he admitted. Sch\u00e4uble warned that European welfare standards should not be jeopardised in order to cut youth unemployment figures. \"We would have a revolution, not tomorrow, but on the very same day,\" he warned. Germany and Austria have the lowest rate of youth unemployment, with 8% not in work, education or training.",

      "bodyText": "US house prices were 10.9% higher in March than a year earlier, the largest increase in close to seven years, according to a closely-watched index tracking home prices in 20 major cities. The news, and signs of growing consumer confidence, helped spur a rally on US stock markets, which closed at new highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained over 106 points to close at 15,409, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index closed up 10.46 points at 1,660. Economics thinktank the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index hit a five-year high in May. The index rose to 76.2, the strongest figure since February 2008 and higher than economists had forecast. All three S&amp;P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices reported double-digit annual increases in home prices in March. The 10-city index rose 10.3%, the 20-city index rose 10.9%, and the national composite index rose 10.2%. The housing market has long been seen as a stumbling block for economic recovery in the US, and problems remain. Gains, however, are widespread, according to the latest report. Phoenix had the largest annual increase at 22.5%, followed by San Francisco with 22.2% and Las Vegas with 20.6%. Miami and Tampa recorded annual gains of 10.7% and 11.8% respectively. The weakest annual price gains were seen in New York (2.6%), Cleveland (4.8%) and Boston (6.7%). \"Even these numbers are quite substantial,\" said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Prices for the 10- and 20-city indices rose 1.4% from February to March and by 0.3% in January to February, a period in which sales are typically muted because of winter weather. In the first quarter of 2013, the national composite rose by 1.2%. Charlotte, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle and Tampa recorded their largest month-over-month gains in more than seven years. \"Home prices in all 20 cities posted annual gains for the third month in a row. Twelve of the 20 saw prices rise at double-digit annual growth. The national index and the 10-and 20-city composites posted their highest annual returns since 2006,\" said Blitzer. \"Other housing market data reported in recent weeks confirm these strong trends: housing starts and permits, sales of new home and existing homes continue to trend higher. At the same time, the larger than usual share of multi-family housing, a large number of homes still in some stage of foreclosure and buying-to-rent by investors suggest that the housing recovery is not complete.\" Home prices have now returned to levels last seen in 2003, but remain 28% below their 2006 peak. According to a recent report from housing analyst Zillow, 25.4% of US homeowners were in negative equity \u2013 owing more than their homes are worth \u2013 in the first quarter of 2013, down from 27.5% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, said problems remained in the US market. There was an \"unhealthy\" reliance on institutional buyers snapping up cheap properties and it remained a difficult market for first-time buyers looking for a loan. \"The recovery needs to be seen in context of how far things fell,\" he said. \"But the strength in the market is boosting confidence and pulling people out of negative equity. It would be foolish to say the recovery can't stall but the fundamentals are definitely in place.\"",

      "body": "<p>Walmart, which has endured a year of bad publicity around its US labour relations and working conditions in its overseas supply chain, on Tuesday pleaded guilty to dumping hazardous waste in numerous sites in California.</p> <p>The retail giant will now pay a fine of $81m to settle misdemeanour charges around the issue, which also covers allegations of misdoings in Missouri. It brings an end to an investigation that has lasted nearly a decade.</p> <p>Walmart admitted that it had negligently dumped pollutants into sanitation drains across California, and also tossed waste into local trash bins. Some material was also improperly taken to product return centers throughout the US without proper safety documentation.</p> <p>Officials at Walmart pointed out that the case covered incidents that had happened between 2003 and 2005, and insisted it had now changed its procedures. \"We have fixed the problem. We are obviously happy that this is the final resolution,\" company spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan told the Associated Press.</p> <p>The illegal dumping covered by this plea took place in 16 Californian counties and was brought to light after a health department official in San Diego noticed a Walmart worker pouring bleach down a drain. Walmart, which in 2010 agreed to pay $27.6m in a similar case, says that its entire national system for dealing with hazardous waste has been comprehensively overhauled.</p> <p>The guilty plea is the latest piece of bad news to put Walmart into the headlines. Earlier on Tuesday, the union supported Walmart worker organisation Our Walmart began the latest in a series of strikes aimed at highlighting what it says are low wages and abusive working conditions. Walmart workers walked out in Florida, Massachusetts and California with some aiming to stay off work until the firm holds its annual general meeting at its Arkansas headquarters on June 7.</p> <p>The protests follow a series of strikes last year, including ones aimed at disrupting Black Friday \u2013 one of the the busiest shopping days in the US.</p> <p>It also comes after Walmart's role in sourcing goods from poorer countries has come under intense scrutiny.

The retail giant will now pay a fine of $81m to settle misdemeanour charges around the issue, which also covers allegations of misdoings in Missouri. It brings an end to an investigation that has lasted nearly a decade. Walmart admitted that it had negligently dumped pollutants into sanitation drains across California, and also tossed waste into local trash bins. Some material was also improperly taken to product return centers throughout the US without proper safety documentation. Officials at Walmart pointed out that the case covered incidents that had happened between 2003 and 2005, and insisted it had now changed its procedures. \"We have fixed the problem. We are obviously happy that this is the final resolution,\" company spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan told the Associated Press. The illegal dumping covered by this plea took place in 16 Californian counties and was brought to light after a health department official in San Diego noticed a Walmart worker pouring bleach down a drain. Walmart, which in 2010 agreed to pay $27.6m in a similar case, says that its entire national system for dealing with hazardous waste has been comprehensively overhauled. The guilty plea is the latest piece of bad news to put Walmart into the headlines. Earlier on Tuesday, the union supported Walmart worker organisation Our Walmart began the latest in a series of strikes aimed at highlighting what it says are low wages and abusive working conditions. Walmart workers walked out in Florida, Massachusetts and California with some aiming to stay off work until the firm holds its annual general meeting at its Arkansas headquarters on June 7. The protests follow a series of strikes last year, including ones aimed at disrupting Black Friday \u2013 one of the the busiest shopping days in the US. It also comes after Walmart's role in sourcing goods from poorer countries has come under intense scrutiny. After a series of lethal disasters in the Bangladeshi garment industry, Walmart and fellow US retailer Gap have been the subject of condemnation after they resisted joining other large firms in forming a group aimed at tightening and enforcing safety regulations. Instead, Walmart has said it will carry out its own investigations of the factories and suppliers that it uses in the country.",

    "webTitle": "US prosecutors: Liberty Reserve ran $6bn money-laundering scheme", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Federal prosecutors in New York have accused a Costa Rica-based company and its founder of running a $6bn money-laundering scheme that became a \"bank of choice for the criminal underworld\". Digital currency company Liberty Reserve was involved in one of the biggest money-laundering operations ever uncovered, according to an indictment on Tuesday by Preet Bharara, the US attorney for the southern district of New York. Liberty was the \"financial hub of the cyber-crime world\", according to the indictment. It facilitated \"a broad range of online criminal activity, including credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography, and narcotics trafficking\". The indictment follows law enforcement actions in 17 countries. Five men, including founder Arthur Budovsky, have been arrested and charged with money-laundering and with operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Two other people are mentioned in the indictment and are believed to be at large. Liberty Reserve was incorporated in Costa Rica in 2006 and was one of the world's most widely used digital currencies. The service allowed account holders to send a receive payments from anywhere in the world. Liberty described itself as the internet's \"largest payment processor and money transfer system\", serving \"millions\" around the world. According to the indictment Liberty Reserve processed more than 12m financial transactions annually with a value of more than $1.4bn. The US authorities claim \"virtually all\" of the activity related to suspected criminal activity. From 2006 to May 2013 Liberty \"laundered more than $6bn in criminal proceeds,\" the indictment states. A spokesman for Liberty Reserve could not immediately be reached for comment. Account holders were not required to prove their identity. They converted local currency into Liberty Reserve dollars using third-party \"exchangers\" who charged a fee then forward the money to Liberty Reserve, according to the indictment. Deposits were similarly done through exchangers in order to add another layer of anonymity. Prosecutors have seized 45 bank accounts and five domain names allegedly used for the operation, including the domain name of Liberty Reserve. Budovsky, also known as Arthur Belanchuk, and Eric Paltz, a naturalized Costa Rican citizen, was detained Friday in Spain. Budovsky was sentenced to five years' probation in 2007 after pleading guilty in a New York court to running E-Gold, another digital money transmitting business, prosecutors said. After his conviction Budovsky gave up his US citizenship, citing concerns to immigration officials that software he was developing \"might open him up to liability in the US\", prosecutors said. He then moved to Costa Rica, where he set up Liberty Reserve. The company ran into trouble with Costa Rican authorities in 2011 over its money-laundering controls. Budovsky \"went underground,\" the indictment says, and continued to operate in Costa Rica using a \"stripped-down staff working out of an office space held in the name of shell companies\". Brian Krebs, cybercrime expert and author of the Krebs on Security blog, said the indictment was a significant move by the US authorities. \"The Justice Department has been very frustrated with these guys for some time,\" he said. He said the timing was particularly interesting given the US authorities growing interest in digital currencies like WebMoney and Bitcoin. Krebs said the chat boards used by many of Liberty's customers had been very active over the weekend with users worried about the fate of their accounts. \"The cybercrime community is quite angry about what's going on. Many folk are very concerned and have a lot to lose. They are saying the imperialist US government is once again showing its true colors,\" he said. Liberty's closure brought criticism from some who claimed their legitimate businesses were being ruined. Epay-cards.com used Liberty to allow consumers outside the US to create accounts to buy goods from stores as if they owned a US-issued Visa or Mastercard credit card. Epay-cards co-founder Mitchell Rossetti said there was about $28,000 now frozen in his company's Liberty account, and had spent the day fielding calls and emails from worried customers. \"We have one type of account used to pay electricity bills,\" he said. \"Some of our customers in places like Senegal and Malaysia don't have access to other types of payment. This is a huge setback.\" Rossetti said he could not guarantee that all his customers' transactions were legitimate, but he added the average size of a epay-card transaction was $63. \"That's not money laundering,\" he said. \"My question is: if this had happened at Wells Fargo and not Liberty Reserve, would they have wound it up like this?\" he said.",

We expect all banks to do everything they can to avoid job losses and we want, we expect, more from banks that are owned by the public. The last thing the public want, I am sure, is for banks to be shedding jobs and for people to be collecting benefits that the taxpayer pays for.\"</p> <p>Case said it was a myth that all bankers were millionaires. \"The vast majority of staff that work for banks are quite modestly paid, some quite low paid, just like other working people.\"</p> <p>Giorgio Questa, a visiting professor at Cass Business School, said one reason for the job losses was the shift in investment banking activity to \"quasi banks\", such as hedge funds, in the wake of government reforms.</p> <p>The government had put in place \"sub-optimal reforms\", he said, following a report by Sir John Vickers that recommended ringfencing high street banks from their \"casino\" investment banking arms.</p> <p>\"Bank regulation, which has not followed the ideas of the Vickers report, which was the best way of looking at things, is sort of stifling the activity of banks in a number of sectors,\" he said. \"It means that a lot of activities [now] not done by banks are being done by quasi banks.\"</p> <p>City analysts expect job losses to keep on coming, as technology replaces jobs that people once did and the banks attempt to trim their wage bills to meet profit targets promised to shareholders.</p>",

An HSBC spokeswoman said the bank had made a net reduction of 1,100 jobs in the UK, once new positions were taken into account. Lloyds, which received a \u00a320.5bn bailout in 2008, will have cut 31,000 jobs by the end of this year, including 2,340 in 2013. The bank, now 39% owned by the British taxpayer, announced 850 job losses this month to cut costs, but was unable to give figures on how many of the 31,000 job losses were in the UK. Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins, appointed to clean up the bank after the Libor-rate rigging scandal, has said it may axe 40,000 roles in the coming years. Barclays will have cut 20,800 jobs by the end of this year since the start of the crisis. This includes about 5,500 jobs lost in the UK between 2008 and 2012. The figures come after three of the four banks reported sharply improved profits. Last month, Lloyds posted first quarter profits of \u00a32bn, up from \u00a3288m at the same time a year ago. HSBC this month said it made a quarterly pre-tax profit of $8.4bn, almost double the $4.3bn it reported at the same time last year. RBS swung to a \u00a3826m profit after a \u00a31.4bn loss last time. Barclays last month reported adjusted first quarter profits had fallen 25% to \u00a31.8bn, partly due to the cost of the bank's restructuring programme. Andrew Case of the Unite trade union described the job cuts as unjustified. He said: \"The amount of jobs we are seeing disappear from the banks is concerning and at the moment we would be foolish to be complacent that we have seen the last of it. We expect all banks to do everything they can to avoid job losses and we want, we expect, more from banks that are owned by the public. The last thing the public want, I am sure, is for banks to be shedding jobs and for people to be collecting benefits that the taxpayer pays for.\" Case said it was a myth that all bankers were millionaires. \"The vast majority of staff that work for banks are quite modestly paid, some quite low paid, just like other working people.\" Giorgio Questa, a visiting professor at Cass Business School, said one reason for the job losses was the shift in investment banking activity to \"quasi banks\", such as hedge funds, in the wake of government reforms. The government had put in place \"sub-optimal reforms\", he said, following a report by Sir John Vickers that recommended ringfencing high street banks from their \"casino\" investment banking arms. \"Bank regulation, which has not followed the ideas of the Vickers report, which was the best way of looking at things, is sort of stifling the activity of banks in a number of sectors,\" he said. \"It means that a lot of activities [now] not done by banks are being done by quasi banks.\" City analysts expect job losses to keep on coming, as technology replaces jobs that people once did and the banks attempt to trim their wage bills to meet profit targets promised to shareholders.",

Last week markets seemed to have assumed the world, or at least QE, was coming to an end. After a few days away, however, investors have come back with a far more positive outlook. In part they are being helped on their way by supportive comments from the Bank of Japan, which is still tightly-wedded to its easing \u00e0 la outrance policy.</p> <p>However, perhaps the most important factor is the growing distance from last week\u2019s Fed minutes. Time has dulled the impact, and investors feel that they can be more relaxed about the hawkish views of a few policymakers. If last week was the dip, then it was shorter than that expected by the even the most positive of traders.</p> <p>May is almost out, and the \u2018go away and sell\u2019 thesis still hasn\u2019t kicked in.</p> <h2>Michael Hewson of CMC Markets</h2> <p>Despite there being very little evidence of a turnaround in economic fundamentals in Europe we\u2019ve seen a complete about turn in sentiment after the sharp losses seen at the end of last week as investors pile back into equity markets on little more than continued central bank support from the Bank of Japan, and expectations of future support from the ECB after <a href=\"http://www.sharecast.com/cgi-bin/sharecast/story.cgi?story_id=20924355\">comments</a> from ECB member Peter Praet that there was still scope to reduce rates further.</p> <p>...Poor consumer confidence data from France and a sharp slide in German import prices has fuelled expectations of further easing from the ECB at next week\u2019s rate meeting. While these expectations of further ECB generosity has helped confidence in risk assets there is no getting away from the fact that Europe\u2019s two largest economies continue to diverge away from each other.</p> <p>Consumer confidence in France sits at its lowest levels since 2008, in complete contrast to Germany where it\u2019s at its highest levels since September 2007, with no expectation that EU leaders have any idea of what to do about it.</p> <h2><strong>Viktor Nossek, head of research at Boost ETP</strong></h2> <p>The FTSE 100 emerged from the Bank Holiday weekend with a bang. Thursday's sharp drop was a distant memory as the UK's flagship index brushed aside any remaining concerns.</p> <p>Exceptionally strong house price and consumer confidence data from the States will only feed the feel-good factor surrounding the FTSE. On Tuesday it felt like we made another major step towards the symbolic 7000 mark.</p> <p>Despite years of weak domestic demand, UK equities are looking increasingly attractive. Britain's blue chips have adjusted to the weaker demand in the economy, repaired their balance sheets and restored their dividend-paying capability.</p> <p>All this despite Britain's meagre rate of GDP growth. But these days, a strong economy is no longer a prerequisite for strong profits.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51a4d08ce4b0e39288861876\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-28T15:52:37.969Z\">4.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">IMF board backs Christine Lagarde</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Just in,</strong> the executive board of the International Monetary Fund has declared that it has confidence in managing director <strong>Christine Lagarde</strong>, after a special French court decided not to place her under investigation.</p> <p>Here's the full statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As we have said before, it would not be appropriate to comment on a case that has been and is currently before the French judiciary.</p> <p>However, the Executive Board has been briefed on this matter, including on the outcome of the recent hearings before the Court of Justice of the Republic in Paris, and has reaffirmed its confidence in the Managing Director\u2019s ability to effectively carry out her duties.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last week, Lagarde was questioned for two days over her role in a controversial \u20ac400m payment given to French businessman <strong>Bernard Tapie</strong> while she was France's finance minister.</p> <p>Following the hearing, the court decided not to place Lagarde under formal investigation.

These young people face not only higher risks of future unemployment, but also higher risks of exclusion, of poverty and of health problems.</p> </blockquote> <p>The memo also outlines how the Erasmus scheme is already being expanded, with a 40% increase in its budget, to allow more young people to study abroad.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51a48880e4b0371c681fa344\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-28T10:35:45.356Z\">11.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Video: Francois Hollande outlines New Deal</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojbFr9-n7-U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojbFr9-n7-U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The \"Europe - Next Steps\" conference in Paris began with a keynote speech from <strong>Francois Hollande, </strong>in which the French president outlined his vision of a new strategy for youth unemployment.</p> <p>Hollande warned that the millions of young people across Europe out of work and education are looking to their leaders for a response based on solidarity.</p> <p>Hollande dubbed them the \"post-crisis generation\", who will \"for ever after, be holding today's governments responsible for their plight\".</p> <p>Here's the key section (<em>from 8 minutes, in the video embedded above</em>)</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Remember the postwar generation, my generation. Europe showed us and gave us the support we needed, the hope we cherished. The hopes that we we could get a job after finishing school, and succeed in life.</p> <p>Can we be responsible for depriving today's young generation of this kind of hope?</p> <p>Imagine all of the hatred, the anger, it's not anger that we're talking about in fact, it goes more than that. We're talking about a complete breakdown of identifying with Europe.</p> <p>What's really at stake here is, not just 'lets punish those in power'. No. Citizens are turning their backs on Europe and the construction of the European project.</p> <p>It's the idea of Europe that is being challenged.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hollande then outlined three key areas for the New Deal which he hopes to see agreed by European leaders at the next EU summit in late June</p> <p><strong>1) EU leaders would commit to spending the \u20ac6bn assigned to fight youth unemployment \"very quickly\", rather than letting the money sit around.</strong></p> <p>Those areas with 25% youth unemployment or higher should get 'accelerated spending', he added.</p> <p><strong>2) EU leaders should implement a \"security system\" for young people who leave school without a job</strong>. After 4 months they would be able to find a job, or additional training, or an internship, or an apprenticeship.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's a great idea, this is what we call the Youth Guarantee. But do we have the ability to implement this objective? Well, we have no choice, we have to do it now.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3) Hollande proposed opening up the Erasmus scheme, under which university students could study overseas</strong>. He wants all young people to get the opportunity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>All young people, regardless of their educational background, would be able to go and continue learning new skills in another European country.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hollande also said small firms need to be given more help to get credit, particularly in crisis-hit countries, and urged the European Investment Bank must release funds to SMEs swiftly.</p> <p>He concluded by warning that Europe faces \"an emergency when it comes to youth unemployment\". Hollande explained that he and Angela Merkel were in agreement over the issue, and would keep developing their \"bilateral project to create more jobs for young people in Europe.</p> <p>And he finished by expressing hope that EU leaders will agree wide-ranging new measures at their summit in June, which is followed by a meeting of European labour ministers in early July.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-05-28T10:48:53.354Z\">at 11.48am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-51a47c74e4b0371c681fa339\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-28T09:44:20.811Z\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Graph: French consumer confidence</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This graph from Reuters underlines the seriousness of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/28/eurozone-crisis-youth-unemployment-markets#block-51a463c0e4b0e3928886182c\">today's drop in French consumer confidence</a>.</p> <p>As well as a near-five year low, this month's reading of 78 is the joint lowest reading at least three decades:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-262f2e6f-b00e-4f90-91d3-f07626d793a0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/28/1369734119836/3474b922-2a39-4927-b41b-4b9536c97b2c-460x292.png\" alt=\"French consumer confidence vs GDP\" width=\"460\" height=\"292\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Thomson Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51a47a03e4b0371c681fa338\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-28T09:33:56.173Z\">10.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cue much milling around in Paris:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BerggruenFR/status/339312950760337408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Le public et les participants prennent une pause <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23EUnextsteps\">#EUnextsteps</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/vWNPhD09ZT\" title=\"http://twitter.com/BerggruenFR/status/339312950760337408/photo/1\">twitter.com/BerggruenFR/st\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Institut Berggruen (@BerggruenFR) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BerggruenFR/status/339312950760337408\">May 28, 2013</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-51a47858e4b0e39288861836\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-05-28T09:32:37.667Z\">10.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble</strong> rounded up the first panel session in Paris (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2013/may/28/eurozone-crisis-youth-unemployment-markets#block-51a469b3e4b0371c681fa32a\">see 9.24am onwards</a>) with a call to European youth not to lose faith.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Europe is our future.

      "bodyText": "Time to wrap things up for the day. Here's a closing summary: \u2022 European politicians from across the region have pledged to take new steps to address the region's youth unemployment crisis, although details remain sketchy tonight. In a speech in Paris, French president Francois Hollande warned that the post-crisis generation would \"turn their backs\" on the European project forever, unless leaders could reverse the rising tide of joblessness among young people . Citizens are turning their backs on Europe and the construction of the European project. It's the idea of Europe that is being challenged. (see 11.35am for highlights, or watch the speech in the video above) Hollande said the EU must agree the so-called Youth Guarantee, a proposal under which young people would be guaranteed a job or training within four months of leaving school (details at 12.03pm). He also advocated expanding the Erasmus programme so apprentices, as well as university students, could be trained and educated in anothe country. \u2022 Several other finance ministers also pledged to do more to fight youth unemployment. Germany's Wolfgang Schauble agreed that the unity of Europe was at stake, while France's Pierre Moscovici said structural reforms could help get under 25s into jobs. (see 10.10am onwards for details, and 12.39pm for a summary from Bloomberg). But firm measures will probably have to wait until EU leaders meet in late June, and Angela Merkel holds a conference on the issue in Berlin on 3 July. \u2022 In other news.... the financial markets rallied sharply following strong US economic data, and the latest indications that central bankers won't halt their monetary easing measures soon. In London, the FTSE 100 finished 107 points higher -- see 5.26pm for closing prices and analyst reaction. That followed a jump in US consumer confidence to a five-year high (see 3.06pm).... ...and the news that US house prices have risen at their fastest annual rate in almost seven years (see 2.29pm) \u2022 France's central bank governor warned that the country must cut spending. Christian Noyer also warned that the upcoming Financial Transaction Tax could harm the French banking sector (see 2.23pm).... \u2022 ....while French consumer confidence tumbled unexpectedly, to its joint-lowest level in decades. (see 10.44am for details). \u2022 And the International Monetary Fund declared that it still has support in Christine Lagarde, its managing director, after her appearance at a special court last week. See 4.52pm for details. \u2022 Italy sold two-year bonds at the lowest interest rates since the eurozone began. (see 12.47pm) \u2022 Polling data from Greece showed that New Democracy had widened its lead over the Syriza opposition (see 1.05pm) \u2022 While in the UK, a poll found that UKIP is on track to win the most votes in next year's European elections (see 1.28pm) I'll be back tomorrow. Until then, thanks, and goodnight. GW Spanish prime minister Mariano Rajoy has called for more help on youth joblessness now. Speaking at the Europe: Next Steps conference in Paris, Rajoy added that more effort is needed to help small firms access credit. Reuters has the details of Rajoy's speech: Spain's Rajoy said on Tuesday that both the European Investment Bank and European Central Bank should do more to help credit flow to small businesses. Speaking at a conference on youth employment in Paris, Rajoy also said the European Union \"should establish a mechanism to temporarily exclude from the national deficit, for the purposes of the excessive deficit procedure, the cost of exemptions granted from social security contributions when young people are hired.\" Rajoy also welcomed the news that Angela Merkel will hold a conference on youth joblessness in Berlin on July 3: The FT says Francois Hollande's speech on youth joblessness this morning (see 11.35am for highlights and video) was a sign of \"growing political concern\" about Europe's youth unemployment levels. Here's a flavour: We must act urgently \u2013 6m youngsters are out of work in Europe\u2009...\u2009close to 14m are without work, study or an apprenticeship,\u201d Mr Hollande said at a conference in Paris that brought together a number of EU finance and labour ministers. He was speaking as France and Germany stepped up efforts to show they were working to tackle the problem, seen as a key element in flagging support for EU institutions and the continent\u2019s political leadership. Mr Hollande separately met French and German finance and labour ministers to discuss a joint initiative he said would culminate in a meeting of all EU labour ministers in Berlin in early July. But the FT added that (as I tried to explain at 12.03pm) most of the measures outlined by Mr Hollande and the various ministers have already been \"widely canvassed\" by EU leaders and the commission. More here: Fran\u00e7ois Hollande raises alarm over Europe\u2019s young jobless Europe's stock markets have closed with strong gains across the board. In London the FTSE 100 jumped more than 100 points as it recovered some of last week's losses. Here's the closing prices \u2022 FTSE 100: up 107 points at 6762, + 1.62% \u2022 German DAX: up 97 points at 8480, +1.16% \u2022 French CAC: up 55 points at 4050, +1.39% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 147 points at 8511, +1.77% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 360 points at 17519, +2.1%. And on Wall Street, the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 are both up around 1%. City traders are attributing the rally to two factors. 1) the strong US data this afternoon (house prices rising at their fastest level since 2006 and a five-year high for consumer confidence) 2) the latest signals from central bankers that the stimulus package isn't over (see 8.50am for details of supportive comments from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank). This morning's bleak French consumer confidence data (see 10.44am), hasn't dented the rally -- on the grounds that bad news means central banks won't tighten monetery policy.... Here's a selection of analyst comment this evening: Chris Beauchamp, market analyst at IG What a difference a weekend makes. Last week markets seemed to have assumed the world, or at least QE, was coming to an end. After a few days away, however, investors have come back with a far more positive outlook. In part they are being helped on their way by supportive comments from the Bank of Japan, which is still tightly-wedded to its easing \u00e0 la outrance policy. However, perhaps the most important factor is the growing distance from last week\u2019s Fed minutes. Time has dulled the impact, and investors feel that they can be more relaxed about the hawkish views of a few policymakers. If last week was the dip, then it was shorter than that expected by the even the most positive of traders. May is almost out, and the \u2018go away and sell\u2019 thesis still hasn\u2019t kicked in. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets Despite there being very little evidence of a turnaround in economic fundamentals in Europe we\u2019ve seen a complete about turn in sentiment after the sharp losses seen at the end of last week as investors pile back into equity markets on little more than continued central bank support from the Bank of Japan, and expectations of future support from the ECB after comments from ECB member Peter Praet that there was still scope to reduce rates further. ...Poor consumer confidence data from France and a sharp slide in German import prices has fuelled expectations of further easing from the ECB at next week\u2019s rate meeting. While these expectations of further ECB generosity has helped confidence in risk assets there is no getting away from the fact that Europe\u2019s two largest economies continue to diverge away from each other. Consumer confidence in France sits at its lowest levels since 2008, in complete contrast to Germany where it\u2019s at its highest levels since September 2007, with no expectation that EU leaders have any idea of what to do about it. Viktor Nossek, head of research at Boost ETP The FTSE 100 emerged from the Bank Holiday weekend with a bang. Thursday's sharp drop was a distant memory as the UK's flagship index brushed aside any remaining concerns. Exceptionally strong house price and consumer confidence data from the States will only feed the feel-good factor surrounding the FTSE. On Tuesday it felt like we made another major step towards the symbolic 7000 mark. Despite years of weak domestic demand, UK equities are looking increasingly attractive. Britain's blue chips have adjusted to the weaker demand in the economy, repaired their balance sheets and restored their dividend-paying capability. All this despite Britain's meagre rate of GDP growth. But these days, a strong economy is no longer a prerequisite for strong profits. Just in, the executive board of the International Monetary Fund has declared that it has confidence in managing director Christine Lagarde, after a special French court decided not to place her under investigation. Here's the full statement: As we have said before, it would not be appropriate to comment on a case that has been and is currently before the French judiciary. However, the Executive Board has been briefed on this matter, including on the outcome of the recent hearings before the Court of Justice of the Republic in Paris, and has reaffirmed its confidence in the Managing Director\u2019s ability to effectively carry out her duties. Last week, Lagarde was questioned for two days over her role in a controversial \u20ac400m payment given to French businessman Bernard Tapie while she was France's finance minister. Following the hearing, the court decided not to place Lagarde under formal investigation. Instead the IMF chief \u2013 who has denied any impropriety \u2013 will be an \"assisted witness\" in the case. That means she will testify in the inquiry, but is not under suspicion of any offence. More details here. Marketwatch Graphics has pulled together this graph showing how US house prices are now growing at their fastest pace since before the credit crunch. As flagged up at 2.29pm, new data released today showed prices are 10.9% higher across 20 US cities. US Treasury bonds are dropping in value, the mirror image of shares on Wall Street. That has pushed up the yield (interest rate) on 10-year US debt by 10 basis points to around 2.11% (ie, from 2.01% overnight). The good news keeps coming, for America at least. Moody's just raised its rating on the US banking system to stable, from negative, for the first time since the financial crisis struck in 2008. That strong US consumer confidence data has sent shares on Wall Street even higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average now up 201 points at 15504. The US dollar is also gaining against other currencies, flags up the FT's Alice Ross: More strong economic data from the US -- the monthly consumer confidence index has jumped to a five year high. The US consumer confidence index came in at 76.2, up from 69 last month. Economists had expected much smaller rise, to 71. And the expectations index, showing how upbeat people were about the future, also posted a strong rise - to 82.4 from 74.3. Lynn Franco, director of economic Indicators at The Conference Board (which compiled the data) said Americans are \"considerably more upbeat\" about future economic and job prospects. Back-to-back monthly gains suggest that consumer confidence is on the mend and may be regaining the traction it lost due to the fiscal cliff, payroll-tax hike, and sequester. Stock markets are rallying strongly today, with the FTSE 100 now up by 120 points, or 1.8%, at 6775 as Wall Street opens. The prospect of ongoing central bank help, and the better-than-expected US house price data (see 2.29pm), appear to be a heady cocktail for the markets. In New York the Dow Jones index is up 150 points, or around 1%, while the Italian stock is up over 2%. Here's the latest prices: Reaction to follow.... US house prices are rising at their fastest pace in nearly seven years, according to the latest piece of upbeat American economic data. The S&amp;P/Case Shiller index of house prices in 20 cities showed prices rose by 10.9% in March, compared with a year ago, beating analyst forecasts. Prices were 1.1% higher month-on-month. While Francois Hollande was speaking in Paris this morning, France's central bank governor was calling for new spending cuts. Christian Noyer used his annual report to the French government to warn that France must take difficult decisions on public expenditure and its welfare system. Noyer warned that: Over a certain threshold, which our country has probably crossed, any increase in public spending and debt has extremely negative effects on confidence. ...adding that \"a profound change in public policy\" is needed if the France economy is to deliver strong and lasting growth that creates jobs. And on welfare spending, Noyer's message was clear -- it must be cut. Welfare spending accounts for around 30% of GDP and the country\u2019s social deficit path is unsustainable as it stands. Giving in to the temptation to keep raising social contributions leads to an increase in labour costs, which ultimately weighs on activity and jobs: the best way to deal with the problem is by tackling spending as this would erode the cost competitiveness, which is already insufficient.

Otherwise, France faced \"the risk of destroying entire segments of our financial industry...\" he wrote. As the Telegraph's Phil Aldrick points out, Sir Mervyn King claimed last week that there was no support for the FTT among European central bankers he'd spoken to.

Speaking at the European Parliament this lunchtime, Van Rompuy pledged to \"put the fight against unemployment high on our agenda\" at the next EU summit in June (prompting the obvious reposte - why wasn't it there already?) Van Rompuy said the European Council meeting is an opportunity for leaders to support the Youth Guarantee, under which all young people would be guaranteed training, further education or employment within four months of leaving school (part of the plan outlined by Francois Hollande this morning). This should be operational by January 2014, he said. Van Rompuy also echoed Hollande's point that Europe's young people are looking for serious progress on the issue: We must rise to the expectations of the millions of young people who expect political action.

The pol showed that UKIP would come first overall with 27%, closely followed by Labour on 23%. The Conservatives would come third with 21%. The survey also found more UK citizens would vote to leave the EU (41%) than stay (37%) if an in-out referendum was held today However, the picture changes if David Cameron achieves 'a significant return of powers' from Brussels to Westminster. Then, 47% of voters believe they'd vote to stay in the European Union,while 32% would still vote to leave. More details here (pdf). Support for Greece's governing New Democracy party has risen in recent weeks, according to an opinion poll published this morning. The survey, for Mega TV by GPO, showed that New Democracy is backed by 21.3% of voters, a 1.8% lead over the left-wing Syriza party. Two other polls released over the weekend also put ND ahead of Syriza, with a lead of up to 2.8%. That, according to Greece's Kathimerini, is the widest lead since ND took power in a three-party coalition almost a year ago. GPO's poll also found that the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party remains in third place. Here's the full details: \u2022 New Democracy: 21.3% \u2022 Syriza: 19.5% \u2022 Golden Dawn: 10.4% \u2022 Pasok: 6.7% \u2022 Independent Greeks: 6.4% \u2022 KKE: 5.8% \u2022 Democratic Left: 5.1% \u2022 Antarsya: 1.8% \u2022 New Greece: 1% Italy sold two-year bonds at the lowest interest rate since the euro was created this morning. It marks a remarkable change of fortune since its future in the eurozone was in doubt 18 months ago. Today's auction was helped by speculation that the European Commission will propose ending its excessive deficit procedure against Italy tomorrow (details here) Reuters has more details of the auction: Rome sold \u20ac2.5 of zero-coupon bonds maturing Dec. 2014 at 1.11%, down from 1.17% at a similar sale one month ago.Italy also issued \u20ac987m of inflation-linked BTPei bonds maturing Sept. 2018, paying a yield of 1.83%. Investors are cautiously returning to high-yielding debt after they cashed in on Italian and Spanish bonds last week on expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve may scale back its asset buying programme in the next few meetings. Bloomberg sums up this morning's events thus: Germany and France said companies in struggling euro-area countries need cheaper credit to create jobs and ease youth unemployment, as Europe\u2019s two biggest economies seek a joint response to the debt crisis. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, his French counterpart, Pierre Moscovici, and Werner Hoyer, who heads the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank, all singled out higher company financing costs in southern Europe as an obstacle to economic recovery at a meeting in Paris today. \u201cAn Italian or Spanish small or medium-size enterprise doesn\u2019t fund its investments at the same rate as a German company,\u201d Moscovici said. \u201cThe channels of financing aren\u2019t working.\u201d Schaeuble said soaring youth unemployment in the region undermines European unification. More here: Franco-German Youth Jobs Push Seen Hinging on Company Credit Italian Labour minister Enrico Giovannini has agreed that Europe must stop abandoning its young people. Like Germany's Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and France's Pierre Moscovici (see 10.10am onwards), Giovannini told the Europe: Next Steps conference that radical new action was now needed. Giovannini said: We have to rescue an entire generation of young people who are scared. We have the best-educated generation and we are putting them on hold. This is not acceptable. Words alone, though, aren't much good to the 5.7 million young people out of work in the EU. Francois's Hollande's speech (see 11.35am) remains the clearest 'vision' of a New Deal, but it does appear that the actual agreement may have to wait until late June. Or possibly even 3rd July, when Angela Merkel hosts a conference on the issue in Berlin. As Reuters puts it: While all agreed on the urgency needed to tackle youth unemployment, ministers offered no concrete plans, insisting Europe must be pragmatic and work on various strands. Former Italian PM Mario Monti just gave a speech at the Europe: Next Steps conference in Paris. He welcomed signs that EU leaders are giving greater attention to structural reforms, rather than just insisting on fiscal discipline. The Berggruen Institute tweeted some of Monti's other key lines: This chart from the EC shows how youth jobless rates vary across Europe, with Greece and Spain both suffering rates over 50%. And this chart grabbed from Bloomberg TV shows the highs and lows (Portugal's 38% is slightly obscured) The European Commission released a memo this morning, outlining its own efforts on youth unemployment. Perhaps stung by events in Paris? The memo (click here) includes full details of the Youth Guarantee which Francois Hollande says must be brought in swiftly (see 11.35am). The EC explains: The Youth Guarantee, based on experience in Austria and Finland, seeks to ensure that all young people up to age 25 receive a quality offer of a job, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. It is based on succesful programs in Austria and Finland. The full cost of the scheme, though, has been estimated at \u20ac21bn. That's more than three times the \u20ac6bn currently set aside, but a fraction of the economic cost of youth unemployment. The EC reckons that unemployment benefit, lost productivity and lost tax revenue from youth joblessness comes to \u20ac153bn per year. In addition, for young people themselves, being unemployed at a young age can have a long-lasting negative \u2018scarring effect\u2019. These young people face not only higher risks of future unemployment, but also higher risks of exclusion, of poverty and of health problems. The memo also outlines how the Erasmus scheme is already being expanded, with a 40% increase in its budget, to allow more young people to study abroad. The \"Europe - Next Steps\" conference in Paris began with a keynote speech from Francois Hollande, in which the French president outlined his vision of a new strategy for youth unemployment. Hollande warned that the millions of young people across Europe out of work and education are looking to their leaders for a response based on solidarity. Hollande dubbed them the \"post-crisis generation\", who will \"for ever after, be holding today's governments responsible for their plight\". Here's the key section (from 8 minutes, in the video embedded above) Remember the postwar generation, my generation. Europe showed us and gave us the support we needed, the hope we cherished. The hopes that we we could get a job after finishing school, and succeed in life. Can we be responsible for depriving today's young generation of this kind of hope? Imagine all of the hatred, the anger, it's not anger that we're talking about in fact, it goes more than that. We're talking about a complete breakdown of identifying with Europe. What's really at stake here is, not just 'lets punish those in power'. No. Citizens are turning their backs on Europe and the construction of the European project. It's the idea of Europe that is being challenged. Hollande then outlined three key areas for the New Deal which he hopes to see agreed by European leaders at the next EU summit in late June 1) EU leaders would commit to spending the \u20ac6bn assigned to fight youth unemployment \"very quickly\", rather than letting the money sit around. Those areas with 25% youth unemployment or higher should get 'accelerated spending', he added. 2) EU leaders should implement a \"security system\" for young people who leave school without a job. After 4 months they would be able to find a job, or additional training, or an internship, or an apprenticeship. It's a great idea, this is what we call the Youth Guarantee. But do we have the ability to implement this objective? Well, we have no choice, we have to do it now. 3) Hollande proposed opening up the Erasmus scheme, under which university students could study overseas. He wants all young people to get the opportunity: All young people, regardless of their educational background, would be able to go and continue learning new skills in another European country. Hollande also said small firms need to be given more help to get credit, particularly in crisis-hit countries, and urged the European Investment Bank must release funds to SMEs swiftly. He concluded by warning that Europe faces \"an emergency when it comes to youth unemployment\". Hollande explained that he and Angela Merkel were in agreement over the issue, and would keep developing their \"bilateral project to create more jobs for young people in Europe. And he finished by expressing hope that EU leaders will agree wide-ranging new measures at their summit in June, which is followed by a meeting of European labour ministers in early July. This graph from Reuters underlines the seriousness of today's drop in French consumer confidence. As well as a near-five year low, this month's reading of 78 is the joint lowest reading at least three decades: Cue much milling around in Paris: Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble rounded up the first panel session in Paris (see 9.24am onwards) with a call to European youth not to lose faith. Europe is our future. We do not have a better future than Europe. Sch\u00e4uble also denied that Europe should just copy America's approach to employment and investment: The head of the European Investment Bank, Werner Hoyer, agreed with Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and Pierre Moscovici that youth unemployment is a threat to the European project. Speaking on the same panel, Hoyer said the EIB had billions of euros of extra funding for projects that would benefit Europe, particularly the youth situation. Germany's Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has warned that the youth unemployment crisis threatens European stability. Speaking at the EU: Next Steps conference in Paris, the Germany finance minster warned that EU leaders would \"lose the battle for European unity\" if they do not win the battle over youth unemployment. Sch\u00e4uble said the crisis in the eurozone had been stabilised, but not solved, cautioning: We cannot keep a generation on hold Sch\u00e4uble said small firms had a crucial role to play in getting more young people into work, if they could show more innovation. But he also warned against setting the \u201cwrong incentives\u201d with new aid policies, says structural reforms are needed to make Europe more competitive, adding: Europe has twice as high social welfare costs as its competitors. He was followed by France's Pierre Moscovici, who agreed that Europe's future was at risk: Moscovici told the conference that toung people are asking whether they should stay in Europe or not. He added: We want Europe to be a continent where youth feels comfortable. Moscovici agreed that Europe does need \"structural reforms\", adding: We are not afraid of structural reforms in France. So, a firm commitment to new measures on youth unemployment, but no actual details of this New Deal. Yet, anyway... Michel Sapin, France's Labor minister, told the conference that the big decisions will be taken at an EU summit in a month's time: Here's a live audio feed from the Europe: Next Steps conference, complete with an English translation: French socialist MP Karine Berger says European leaders needs to fix the youth unemployment crisis fast. Speaking on Bloomberg TV a few moments ago, Berger warned that: Otherwise, thousands of young people in Europe will be hurt forever. Berger agreed that the structure of the labour markets need to be changed, to help young people into employment: We need to find growth, and we need to find structural solutions. Easier said than done, of course. Reforming labour markets is notoriously tricky politically, as it typically means making it easier to dismiss workers or to force them to take new jobs. The 'New Deal' on youth joblessness will be discussed at a conference in Paris today called Europe: Next Steps, at the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris. It's being streamed live here: Europe: les prochaines \u00e9tapes We've had grim economic data from France this morning, where consumers are more pessimistic than any time in nearly five years. The French monthly consumer confidence reading fell to 79, the lowest reading since July 2008, from 83 last month (where the long term average is 100). Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets suggests that today's markets rally shows the City is more relaxed about the US Federal Reserve's plans, after last week's flap over when it will start to slow its own quantitative easing operation: In London, the FTSE 100 has jumped by 100 points, or 1.5%, this morning as investors return their desks after the bank holiday weekend. That follows a calmer day's trading in Japan, where the Nikkei finished 1.2% higher - clawing back some of last week's dramatic losses. Other European markets are also rallying, with Germany's DAX and the French CAC up around 0.7%, while the Spanish and Italian markets are both 1.5% higher. Traders seem to be content that central banks will maintain their stimulus measures for a while longer. Early this morning, Bank of Japan board member Ryuzo Miyao said the BoJ would remain firm, despite the market turmoil of recent days. Miyao argued that investors should not be spooked by rising Japanese bond yields. Even when there is upward pressure on long-term interest rates due to expectations for economic recovery, monetary policy will continue to put downward pressure on interest rates and therefore strongly support economic recovery. And yesterday, the European Central Bank's Jorg Asmussen said the ECB wouldn't tighten policy soon: Our monetary policy is expansive and will remain so as long as necessary. But to keep rates low for too long would create new risks. Some details of this 'New Deal' for youth unemployment have emerged in the media in recent days. Here's a few articles: \u2022 Bloomberg: Franco-German Youth Jobs Push Seeks to Damp National Differences Germany and France plan to present a joint blueprint today to address soaring youth unemployment as Europe\u2019s two biggest economies seek to find common ground in response to the euro region\u2019s financial crisis. \u201cAlmost 6 million unemployed young people -- these are dramatic figures,\u201d German Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen said in an ARD television interview on May 26. \u201cThese young people need an answer now.\u201d \u2022 The Telegraph: 'New Deal' to tackle Europe's mass youth unemployment The \"New Deal for Europe\" will free up EU resources to pay for language courses and fund jobseekers' flights around the continent in search of work. Germany is increasingly concerned about the need to rescue the country's image, and show greater solidarity with southern Europeans suffering a prolonged economic crisis. \u2022 EurActiv: Commission denies Germany's 'dangerous' criticism of youth jobs fight As Germany and France meet today over a joint youth employment initiative, EU officials have rebuffed as \u201cgroundless\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d criticism from the German finance minister that the Commission is failing to address joblessness, EurActiv Germany reports. Ministers from both countries will unveil in Paris the initiative blueprint and allow the European Investment Bank to unlock billions of euros in loans to companies to create jobs for young people. The proposals have been called a \u201cNew Deal for Europe\u201d and echo the drive by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to cut United States unemployment in the 1930s, the Rheinische Post reported this month. But sources say German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has angered the president of the European Commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s complaint that the Commission has been ineffective in its approach towards fighting youth unemployment has not gone down well amongst other EU officials either. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of key events in the eurozone and across the global economy and the financial markets. Europe's youth unemployment crisis takes centre-stage today as Germany and France announce plans for a \"New Deal\" for the millions of young people out of work across the region. Almost one in four young people are out of work in the eurozone, and the scale of the problem appears to have shaken politicians into action. German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and his French counterpart Pierre Moscovici, will meet in Paris today to agree a package of measures to address youth unemployment. The plan is expected to focus on countries with the highest jobless rates, such as Greece and Spain. It could include creating more apprenticeships to get young people into the workplace \u2013 an area where Germany excels already \u2013 and more funding for small firms to help them hire young people. It could also provide support for jobseekers to move across the eurozone to find work. The scheme is also expected to involve the European Investment Bank and tap a \u20ac6bn fund set aside to address youth unemployment in the EU budget. But will the scheme be ambitious enough to tackle a problem that is creating a lost generation and, many fear, threating social cohesion across the region? I'll be tracking events in Paris through the day, along with other important developments across Europe and beyond.",
