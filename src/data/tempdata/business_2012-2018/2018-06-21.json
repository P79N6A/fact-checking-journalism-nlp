      "bodyText": "The Bank of England will be allowed to provide more than \u00a3500bn in lending to the economy without seeking the Treasury\u2019s permission, in a move that reinforces the strength of the UK financial system as Britain prepares to leave the EU. Announcing the plan at the annual Mansion House dinner for bankers in the City of London on Thursday, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, said the changes would help to improve the resilience of the central bank. It would also help with its \u201cability to meet its monetary and financial policy objectives in the future\u201d, he said. Hammond said the government would give the Bank \u00a31.2bn, a sum that would underwrite the \u00a3500bn lending pot, but the move would not impact public borrowing because the money would remain in the public sector. The half a trillion pound fund could be accessed by commercial banks for funding, including during credit crunch-style financial crises. The move also gives Threadneedle Street greater autonomy in lowering interest rates to zero and providing more money to commercial banks during times of stress, without requiring Treasury permission. Despite its independence from the Treasury, the Bank has needed to approach the government in order to expand its support to the economy \u2013 including when it announced an emergency funding scheme for banks in the wake of the Brexit vote. Speaking alongside the chancellor at his penultimate Mansion House dinner before stepping down next year, Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, said the additional capital would significantly increase the amount of money the central bank could lend without seeking financial backing from the Treasury. Although at first it will amount to more than half a trillion pounds, it could rise to over three-quarters of a trillion pounds. He said the changes could also help the government to strike new deals with emerging markets to facilitate the growth of the UK financial sector, which could increase from 10 times the size of the British economy at present to 15 times by 2030. \u201cWe now have a balance sheet fit for a new world order with greater reliance on markets in a wider range of reserve currencies,\u201d he said. As part of the changes, the Bank of England will see the emergency funding programme launched straight after the Brexit vote, known as the term funding scheme \u2013 which provides banks with cheap finance during times of stress \u2013 become part of the Bank of England\u2019s balance sheet rather than the Treasury\u2019s.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green is seeking a gagging order to prevent the full publication of a watchdog\u2019s report that casts fresh light on the BHS scandal. On Thursday, Green launched a high court bid to stop the Financial Reporting Council publishing its damning report on the failures of the auditors responsible for checking BHS\u2019s accounts. The Topshop tycoon wants sections of the FRC analysis to be redacted or changed, arguing that references to him and other members of the former BHS management could cause \u201cserious and potentially irreparable harm\u201d to their reputations. Last week Steve Denison, the senior PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant who audited the BHS accounts ahead of its sale for \u00a31, only a year before the department store chain collapsed, was given a 15-year ban and and record personal fine of \u00a3325,000 after he admitted misconduct. PwC was given a record \u00a36.5m fine but the FRC\u2019s report was not published at the same time. Andrew Green QC, the barrister acting for Taveta, the retail billionaire\u2019s holding company, told the high court it was not seeking to block the publication of the report, which is primarily focused on PwC\u2019s failings. \u201cThis [goal] can be achieved with a redacted version,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is fundamental to bear in mind the gravity of the criticism. The prejudice to those individuals would be severe.\u201d Charles B\u00e9ar, the barrister acting for the FRC, said it was not in the public interest to make any changes. \u201cPublication of only part of the FRC\u2019s reasons would be either unintelligible or misleading or both,\u201d he said. The Commons work and pensions committee, which carried out an investigation into the demise of the department store in 2016, has already received a copy of the report. Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the committee and has regularly locked horns with Green over BHS, has been pushing for its publication. Field, who watched Thursday\u2019s hearing, said outside the court that he would challenge any attempt by Green to modify the report. \u201cThis attempt at a gagging order is also gagging parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some stage we will have to come and argue there is a wider public interest than Sir Philip Green\u2019s reputation.\u201d Taveta is asking for an interim injunction before a judicial review. Mr Justice Nicklin said the hearing had raised \u201cimportant issues that need to be properly considered\u201d and he would pass judgment as soon as possible. On Thursday, a leaked email sent to nearly 1,000 PwC partners and written by the firm\u2019s UK chairman, Kevin Ellis, was heavily critical of Denison who, it emerged, had backdated his BHS audit opinion and spent just two hours working on the file. In the email, Ellis described Denison\u2019s supervision of the audit as \u201cinadequate\u201d with too much work delegated to a junior team member. \u201cThis situation should not have happened and we need to face up to the failings and learn the lessons,\u201d he wrote.",

    "webTitle": "Pound rallies after Bank of England is split on interest rates - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hello again. The pound has continued to climb, on the back of the news that three Bank of England policymakers pushed to raise interest rates at this week\u2019s meeting. Sterling has now risen to $1.325, up three quarters of a cent today, as traders anticipate a rate rise in August (maybe). That has pulled down shares in London, though (as a stronger currency erodes the value of overseas earnings). Stock markets have also been hit by another bout of trade war jitters. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 shed 70 points, or nearly 1%, to 7556. That\u2019s its lowest level since early May. In Germany, the Dax shed 1.5%, dragged down by automobile stocks following Daimler\u2019s profits warning. David Madden of CMC Markets says: Equity markets are lower as dealers are worried about the global trade situation. The standoff between the US and China is not any closer to being resolved, and traders are fearful President Trump will turn up the heat on the EU next. Time for a recap. The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. But three policymakers, including chief economist Andy Haldane, pushed for rates to rise to 0.75%. The split vote raises the chances that interest rates are hiked in August. Some experts aren\u2019t convinced, though, and believe borrowing costs could remain unchanged for longer. The pound jumped following the announcement, rising from a 7-month low to reach $1.325. The Bank of England also changed its guidance on quantitative easing. It now expects to start unwinding its bond-buying programme once interest rates have hit 1.5%, down from a previous goal of 2%. Britain\u2019s public finances have improved, thanks to a rise in tax receipts. The UK borrowed \u00a35bn to balance the books in May, the smallest amount in over a decade. Economists say the government has more flexibility to relax austerity. With borrowing below forecast, Philip Hammond has the firepower to increase spending on the NHS. Eurozone finance ministers are meeting to discuss Greece. The Eurogroup will consider how Athens will complete its bailout this summer, and what measures are needed to help it return to the financial markets. I\u2019ll be back later when we have developments on Greece... Shares in Europe\u2019s carmakers are sliding after Germany\u2019s Daimler issued a profits warning, and blamed Donald Trump\u2019s trade disputes. Daimler warned that profits would be \u201cslightly below the previous year\u2019s level\u201d, and blamed the prospect of higher tariffs on US cars sold into China (Daimler has a factory in America making SUVs). Daimler shares have fallen 4%, with Fiat (-3.5%), Volkswagen (-3.2%) and BMW (-2.75%) also dragged down. In other news, the boss of Intel - Brian Krzanich - is resigning after conducting a relationship with an employee. Although the relationship was consensual, it breached the chipmaker\u2019s \u2018no fraternisation\u2019 policy. Hannah Maundrell, Editor in Chief of money.co.uk, has some advice for savers and borrowers: \u201cOnce again you can breathe a sigh of relief if you\u2019re on a variable rate mortgage; the Bank of England just bought you some time to get a cheaper, fixed deal sorted. You\u2019re not out of the woods yet though. With a rate rise still expected soon the clock is ticking loudly at you especially as the vote was split this month. Check if you\u2019re on a variable deal and speak to a decent mortgage broker about your options if so. It\u2019s likely you\u2019ll save a significant chunk of cash which I\u2019m sure you could better spend elsewhere. \u201cIf your fixed mortgage ends in the next 6 months consider prebooking a mortgage now too as it can help you to lock in a lower rate. \u201cSavers, don\u2019t bank on a rate increase to make things better; banks are notoriously slow to pass on any rises so it\u2019s best to take matters into your own hands. Aim to get your return as close to inflation as possible, and beat it if you can. While this is still a challenge, now inflation has tapered slightly and rates topping best buy tables are slowly started to creep up, the situation isn\u2019t quite as dire as it was. Via Kallum Pickering of Berenberg, here\u2019s a handy chart showing how the odds of an August rate hike have jumped to over 60% today: Pickering says Haldane\u2019s vote has made City economists change their forecasts: Today\u2019s surprise vote for a rate hike by the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane shifts the balance of probability for the next hike to the August meeting. Previously we had called for a November hike, with a risk of a potential move in August already. However, the minutes from the June meeting show that, despite heightened uncertainty about the global economy linked to trade tensions, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is confident that growth has rebounded to around its trend rate in Q2 (c0.4% qoq) after a soft patch in Q1. Foreign exchange dealer Argentex suggests the next UK interest rate rise might come in the autumn, not his summer. But it all depends on whether growth picks up, after slowing to just 0.1% in January-March. An August move is still possibly too soon, but November is now far more realistic. We remain optimistic of a sterling recovery, aside from the ongoing political risks, we are moving closer to monetary tightening. We\u2019ll need to see stronger economic fundamentals in the short-term. If the shaky first quarter was just an blip then the MPC is likely to act.\u201d A new Brexit crisis could derail the Bank of England from raising interest rates in August, despite Haldane\u2019s hawkish conversion. Silvia Dall\u2019Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management, explains: The Bank seems determined to deliver one more hike in the second half of the year, justified by a tight labour market and an economy now working close to potential. However, there are several reasons to err on the side of caution. In particular, recent hard data on industrial production and surveys on economic activity suggest that the prospects of a significant rebound in economic performance are uncertain following a weak Q1. Moreover, risks of a disruptive Brexit event down the road are still high. Negotiations have stalled in recent months reflecting unresolved divisions within the UK Cabinet, and the upcoming EU council at the end of June is unlikely to deliver any progress, as other issues (not least international trade tensions) are now topping the EU leaders\u2019 agenda. City economist Sam Tombs of Pantheon has spotted that the pound started to rally just before the Bank\u2019s decision was published. Sterling was trading at $1.310 at 11.50am, but had snuck over $1.313 by 11.59am: The Bank actually held its meeting yesterday, and keeps its decision tightly under wraps until the official announcement. But was it tight enough?... Another development: the Bank of England has changed its guidance about when it might start unwinding its quantitative easing (QE) stimulus programme. The Bank currently holds \u00a3435bn of bonds bought through QE using newly-created electronic money. It has now decided it could start to sell some of these bonds when interest rates have risen to 1.5% (compared to 0.5% today). It had previously aimed for 2%. Neil Wilson of Markets.com thinks this shows the Bank doesn\u2019t expect rates to hit 2% for a long time. A lower bar but whether 1.5% or 2% - neither are going to happen any time soon, so this is of marginal relevance to investors right now. It\u2019s indeed probably an admission it doesn\u2019t see rates hitting 2% for a very long time indeed, while 1.5% is a bit more achievable.\u201d Neil Birrell, Chief Investment Officer at Premier Asset Management, agrees: Another significant change was in QE guidance; the bank won\u2019t consider reducing the debt purchased until the rate reaches 1.5%, down from 2%. This suggests that they now think rates will have a lower peak this cycle than previously expected. \u201cThis is mixed news for markets. In the short term, it\u2019s a positive for Sterling and we may see gilt yields rise modestly, but the outlook is still unclear, as is the message from the bank.\u201d Andy Haldane\u2019s transformation to an interest rate hawk means there is more chance of an interest rate rise in August, says Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA. Prior to today\u2019s meeting, investors were unconvinced by the prospect of a rate hike in August but I think today\u2019s release will change that. Sterling rallied above 1.32 against the dollar from just above 1.31 prior to the release which suggests people\u2019s expectations for August are being quickly revised. While a hike in November makes more sense as there\u2019ll be more clarity \u2013 hopefully \u2013 by then, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they go in August given the criticism they endured for holding off in May. The Bank\u2019s official position is that it expects that \u201can ongoing tightening of monetary policy\u201d will be appropriate over the next couple of years, if the economy performs as expected. Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that this isn\u2019t a concrete promise to raise rates soon Today\u2019s 6-3 split is a surprise, says Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown: But that doesn\u2019t mean that interest rates will definitely rise in August, he adds: There was a small element of surprise in the voting, with the Bank\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane joining Michael Saunders and perma-hawk Ian McCafferty in calling for an immediate rate rise. Economists had expected a 7-2 split, but in the event a forecast uptick in inflation was enough to split the committee 6-3. Sterling jumped on the news, gaining almost a cent against the dollar as traders factored in a bigger chance of a move in August. But on balance I still think we might not see a rate rise for the rest of the year - policymakers will at the very least want confirmation that the weak first-quarter growth figure was just a blip before raising borrowing costs. There is clearly a split at the Bank of England over the state of the British economy. The minutes of today\u2019s meeting show that six members believe the UK economy isn\u2019t strong enough to handle higher interest rates, especially with the global economy looking shakier. Those members are governor Mark Carney, deputy governors Ben Broadbent, Jon Cunliffe and Dave Ramsden, and external committee members Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe. As the minutes put it: For the majority of members, an increase in Bank Rate at this meeting was not required. For these members, the news since the previous meeting had given them greater reassurance that the softness of activity in the first quarter had been largely temporary. In particular, indicators of household consumption had recovered strongly from their subdued levels at the time of the previous meeting. Set against that, the outlook for global growth had weakened somewhat, and global financial conditions had tightened, with some modest impact on UK bank funding and corporate credit spreads. Data on manufacturing output and goods exports in April had been weak, although business surveys had generally suggested steady underlying GDP growth. For these members, there was value in seeing how the data evolved from here, in order to learn more about the extent to which conditions were evolving in line with the May Inflation Report projections. But chief economist Andy Haldane disagreed! Along with external members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders, Haldane argued that the economy was healthy, and that growth was bouncing back from the winter slowdown. The minute say that this trio pushed for higher borrowing costs, to avoid a spike in inflation. Three members favoured an immediate increase in Bank Rate. These members had a higher degree of confidence that the slowdown in Q1 was temporary or erratic and would largely be unwound. They felt that the economy was developing broadly in line with the May Inflation Report forecasts, but the most recent indicators of labour demand and pay settlements indicated some upside risks to the expected pickup in average weekly earnings and unit wage costs. These members also felt that the benefits of waiting for additional information were limited. Rather, they judged that a modest tightening of monetary policy at this meeting could mitigate the risks of a more sustained period of above-target inflation that might ultimately necessitate a less gradual subsequent change in policy and hence a sharper adjustment in growth and employment. You can read the minutes online here. The pound is rallying, following the news that three Bank of England policymakers voted to raise interest rates today. Chief economist Andy Haldane\u2019s conversion to a hawk makes an August interest rate rise more likely, City traders believe. This has sent sterling back up to $1.32, away from this morning\u2019s seven-month low. Newsflash: The Bank of England has voted to leave interest rates at 0.5%. But it\u2019s a split vote! The Bak\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane voted to raise borrowing costs to 0.75%, along with Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders. The remaining six members of the MPC voted to leave rates on hold, though. More to follow! The pound is weakening, as the City braces for the Bank of England\u2019s decision on interest rates at noon. Sterling has fallen by 0.3% today to $1.313 against the US dollar. That\u2019s its lowest level this year. Over in Europe, the eurozone\u2019s bailout fund has warned that Greece still faces major \u201cchallenges\u201d before it can end its bailout programme this summer That\u2019s an important point, as eurozone ministers gather to discuss Greece\u2019s financial future this afternoon. Helena Smith reports from Athens \u201cGreece has made significant progress in stabilising its economy,\u201d the European Stability Mechanism said in its 2017 annual report. \u201cContinuing on this path is decisive for the sovereign to regain stable market access. [\u2026] Despite strengthened market confidence, the Greek economy faces a difficult economic and financial environment. Greece must address remaining challenges before the programme concludes to ensure that it can build upon its significant programme achievements in the post-programme period.\u201d The assessment echoes similar comments by the ESM\u2019s managing director Klaus Regling in Athens last week. Speaking after holding talks with the Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, the ESM chief said despite the progress the debt-stricken country had made, it will continue to remain under \u201ctight\u201d surveillance when it exits its current bailout programme in August. Supervision is expected to be strict for several years. \u201cSurveillance will be tight in the case of Greece,\u201d he told reporters adding that while all bailed out euro zone economies were subject to supervision, Athens would be given especially enhanced oversight because of the unprecedented amounts of emergency bailout funding the country had received. Greece would only be a success story if it continued to implement tough economic reforms, Regling said. If it fails to do so, investor confidence will plummet and the markets will retaliate, he warned. Excluded from international capital markets, Greece has been dependent on international rescue funds since May 2010 in what has been the biggest bailout of any state in global financial history. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, says the drop in UK borrowing will allow the government to relax its austerity policies. However, tax rises will still be needed to fund the increase in NHS spending announced this week, he adds: \u201cAs a share of GDP, public borrowing in 2017/18 is now estimated to be just 1.9%, the first time the budget deficit has been below 2% of GDP since 2001/2. Since the OBR estimates that the output gap in 2017/18 was close to zero, the structural budget deficit was probably also just below 2% of GDP in that year, meaning that the Chancellor has already met his medium term fiscal target set originally for 2020 with further deficit reductions likely over the next couple of years. \u201cSo the Chancellor can afford to ease off on austerity without endangering his medium term fiscal targets. We estimate that, of the proposed \u00a325 billion of real NHS spending rises across the UK by 2023/24, around \u00a310 billion is already implicit in current spending plans used in OBR forecasts. So we estimate that the Chancellor may only need to raise taxes or increase borrowing relative to previous plans by around \u00a315 billion in 2023/24 to fund these plans, which is equivalent to around 0.6% of GDP in that year. A net tax rise of around 0.3% of GDP, plus a modest borrowing rise of a similar magnitude would be enough to fund the additional health spending over and above that implicit in current fiscal projections. Britain is on track to undershoot the government\u2019s borrowing forecast by around \u00a39bn this financial year, says Andrew Wishart of Capital Economics. He also agrees that chancellor Philip Hammond has more firepower than expected: Wishart says: While we wouldn\u2019t place too much weight on the estimates of borrowing in the early months of the fiscal year, since they are largely based on forecasts rather than actual data, the continued improvement in the public finances suggests that the deficit will undershoot the OBR\u2019s forecast again this year. What\u2019s more, if the economy holds up as we expect, borrowing is likely to undershoot the OBR\u2019s forecast by a more significant margin in subsequent years. This would allow the Chancellor to deliver the recently promised \u00a315bn increase in health spending over the next five years while still meeting his fiscal target (for the cyclically-adjusted deficit to be less than 2% of GDP in 2020/21). Today\u2019s UK public finance figures look \u201cfantastic\u201d, says Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics. He warns that the trend probably won\u2019t continue, but there\u2019s still room to increase NHS spending. We still expect full-year public borrowing to be only a little below the OBR\u2019s Spring Statement forecast. The Chancellor, however, still will have scope to pause the fiscal consolidation at the Budget later this year, given that cyclically-adjusted borrowing as a share of GDP already will be below his 2020 target of 2% this year. Most of the likely extra borrowing, however, looks set to be earmarked for the NHS, leaving little scope for measures to boost households\u2019 spending or business investment. Howard Archer of the EY Item Club says: The Chancellor will be heartened by the healthy start to the 2018/19 fiscal year following better-than-expected public finances in 2017/18. It suggests that he may have more room for manoeuvre in November\u2019s Budget as he looks to find the extra funding needed for the high-profile increased spending promised for the NHS. Matt Whittaker of Resolution Foundation also believes chancellor Philip Hammond has more flexibility to boost government spending on services such as health. The improvement in the UK public finances suggests there is room to boost spending on key public services. Rupert Harrison, former advisor to the Treasury, believes the NHS (just promised a spending increase) should benefit: Harrison (now at asset manager BlackRock) tweets: The government will be delighted by today\u2019s fall in borrowing, says Kamal Ahmed of the BBC: Fraser Munro of the Office for National Statistics points out that last year\u2019s borrowing figures were better than expected too: The Conservative Party have welcomed the news: (yes, that\u2019s the same Conservative Party that once hoped to eliminate the entire deficit by 2015) Newsflash: UK government borrowing fell last month as the long, slow process of fixing the public finances continues. Britain borrowed \u00a35bn to balance the books in May, the Office for National Statistic reports. That\u2019s down from around \u00a37bn in May 2017 and is the lowest borrowing for any May since 2005. In April and May combined, Britain has borrowed \u00a311.8bn. That\u2019s \u00a34.1bn less than a year ago, and the best start to a financial year since 2007 (before the financial crisis). This improvement is due to rising tax revenues, the ONS explains: In the latest financial year-to-date, central government received \u00a3112.9 billion in income, including \u00a382.6 billion in taxes. This was around 3% more than in the same period in 2017. Over the same period, central government spent \u00a3123.6 billion, roughly equal to that spent in the same period in 2017. Of this amount, just below two-thirds was spent by central government departments (such as health, education and defence), around one-third on social benefits (such as pensions, unemployment payments, Child Benefit and Maternity Pay), with the remaining being spent on capital investment and interest on government\u2019s outstanding debt. In another boost, last year\u2019s deficit has been revised down to \u00a339.5bn, down from \u00a340.5bn. That\u2019s the lowest net borrowing since the financial year ending March 2007. Overall, Britain\u2019s national debt stands at \u00a31.8 trillion, or around 85% of GDP. Economists are all-but certain that the Bank of England won\u2019t raise interest rates today. City AM\u2019s \u2018shadow MPC\u2019 of nine City experts unanimously agree that the BoE should hold borrowing costs, given recent mixed economic data and the ongoing Brexit talks. As Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Gordon put it: There are three main sources of uncertainty in the UK economy: the source of the first-quarter slowdown, the progress of Brexit negotiations and the impact of higher petrol prices. Hold bank rate while assessing these uncertainties further. Morgan Stanley predict that the Bank of England will hold interest rates today, in a 7-2 split (the same as last month). They also expect the BoE to give a hawkish message in the minutes of the meeting (which are also released at noon). MS\u2019s Jacob Nell and Shreya Chander told clients: June to reiterate May\u2019s wait-and-see message: As usual, we are sceptical of action at a non-Inflation Report meeting, given the lack of a new forecast, and expect an unchanged 7-2 vote to hold. Mixed data also makes it unlikely that we get any strong new guidance on August. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial market, the eurozone and business. The Bank of England is in the spotlight today as its Monetary Policy Committee meets to set interest rates. While borrowing costs probably won\u2019t change today, the City will be looking for hints that the long-awaited hike could come in August. The key issue is whether the Bank still believes the recent weakness in UK economic growth is temporary. That slowdown scared the MPC away from raising interest rates last month, forcing investors to rethink their expectations about how fast borrowing costs will rise. The two hawkish members of the MPC, Michael Saunders and Ian McCafferty, will likely vote for a hike today. The majority, though, will (probably!) decide to leave interest rates at just 0.5%. Mike Bell of JP Morgan Asset Management argues that there\u2019s no reason to raise interest rates yet, especially with Brexit uncertainty bubbling away: Some lead indicators suggest wage growth could soon start to accelerate, so the case for a rate hike is building. However, there\u2019s no rush to raise to rates this week given still high political and economic uncertainty. But you never know.... It\u2019s also an important day for Greece. The Greek bailout ends in August, so Eurozone finance ministers will discuss what debt relief measures are needed to help Athens return to the financial markets. The Greek government is hoping for substantive measures to address its debt pile, which has swelled to 180% of its GDP. Spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters: \u201cWe are optimistic that we are on the verge of a solution with substance.\u201d Full-blown debt write-offs aren\u2019t on the agenda, but the eurozone could agree to extend the payback data on Greek debt, giving Athens more wriggle-room to recover from years of economic trauma. Tzanakopoulos argues that Greece needs debt relief in order to become an \u2018ordinary\u2019 country again: \u201cThe accepted criteria for all sides is that this solution be convincing for markets and embed the creditworthiness of our country - the final act in restoring the credibility of Greece to be able to plan for the next day like any ordinary country. The eurogroup will also discuss what \u2018surveillance\u2019 measures should be imposed on Greece, to ensure it keeps meeting its commitments even after the bailout is over. We\u2019ll also keep an eye on Vienna, where Opec members are gathering for tomorrow\u2019s meeting. Some oil ministers (including the Saudis) are pushing for a deal to raise oil output, but others are keener to maintain current production caps....and keep prices higher. Plus, the latest UK public finances will show how much Britain borrowed last month.

It\u2019s likely you\u2019ll save a significant chunk of cash which I\u2019m sure you could better spend elsewhere.</p> <p> \u201cIf your fixed mortgage ends in the next 6 months consider prebooking a mortgage now too as it can help you to lock in a lower rate.</p> <p> \u201cSavers, don\u2019t bank on a rate increase to make things better; banks are notoriously slow to pass on any rises so it\u2019s best to take matters into your own hands. Aim to get your return as close to inflation as possible, and beat it if you can. While this is still a challenge, now inflation has tapered slightly and rates topping best buy tables are slowly started to creep up, the situation isn\u2019t quite as dire as it was.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5b2ba8a9e4b06f2cac880a8e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-06-21T13:35:21.726Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chart: August interest rate hike looks more likely</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Via Kallum Pickering of Berenberg, here\u2019s a handy chart showing how the odds of an August rate hike have jumped to over 60% today:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4edfc1ef0429c41a00e91406cb5a2bdcf18e7b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4edfc1ef0429c41a00e91406cb5a2bdcf18e7b5/0_0_576_356/500.png\" alt=\"UK interest rate probabilities\" width=\"500\" height=\"309\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Pickering says Haldane\u2019s vote has made City economists change their forecasts:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s surprise vote for a rate hike by the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane shifts the balance of probability for the next hike to the August meeting.</p> <p>Previously we had called for a November hike, with a risk of a potential move in August already.

But Opec\u2019s crunch meeting in Vienna on Friday finds the oil cartel divided after nearly two years of unity over production curbs, which were due to run until the year\u2019s end. Saudi Arabia and Russia are leading the push to boost supplies; Iran, Iraq and Venezuela are opposed to a significant increase. Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday that increasing production by 1m barrels a day \u201csounds like a good target to work with\u201d. Here are five charts that explain why Vienna will be fractious and, as RBC Global Asset Management said, \u201ca tricky one to predict\u201d. The oil price Since Opec and Russia agreed in late 2016 to curb production in a bid to rebalance world supply and demand, crude prices have jumped 55%. Brent crude, the international benchmark, recently hit highs of $80 (\u00a360) a barrel, raising inflation fears and concerns it could act as a brake on world economies. Prices have since fallen back slightly, to around $74, on market expectation that the Opec meeting will agree a rise in crude production. OECD oil inventories Higher oil prices spurred a jump in output from US shale fields, but not enough to offset the output reductions by Opec and its allies. The so-called \u201cVienna group\u201d of the cartel\u2019s 14 members and Russia could consider its goal of rebalancing oil markets as \u201cmission accomplished\u201d, the International Energy Agency said in the spring. That success opened the door for the producers to start thinking about an exit strategy from the cuts. Venezuela and Iran Until recently, many observers thought this week\u2019s meeting would likely just mark an easing of the cuts, not a reverse ferret. The US changed that calculus in May by promising to reimpose sanctions on Iran and threatening sanctions on European companies that did business there. The country supplies 4% of the world\u2019s oil, so its expected drop in exports will cause a shortfall. Supply has already been dented by production freefall in crisis-hit Venezuela. Saudi Arabia and Russia have the capacity to pump more oil; Iran, Iraq, Algeria and Venezuela do not, and have nothing to gain from higher production and lower prices. US gasoline prices Democrats have attacked Trump for rising gasoline prices, pinning the blame on his policies. Whether it\u2019s right to lay the blame squarely at the president\u2019s door \u2013 and some certainly should be, for pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal \u2013 what\u2019s clear is that Trump knows high prices at the pump will not help Republicans in the mid-term elections in November. \u201cOil prices are too high, Opec is at it again. Not good!\u201d the president tweeted last week. The US has asked cartel members to increase their output. Oil demand While Opec can take some of the credit for pushing up prices, supply is not the only factor. Strong economic growth globally has driven surprisingly high demand for crude, and shows no sign of stopping. The International Energy Agency is forecasting demand to hit 100m barrels per day next year. That appetite should stop prices crashing to the lows of 2014-16, as the Saudis and Russians change course on output cuts. It remains to be seen whether they get Iran and others onboard for a formal Opec agreement, or go ahead with increases regardless. Russia has said that if the Vienna group agrees to raise output, members could meet again in September for a review.",

    "webTitle": "Bank of England moves closer to August interest rate rise", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England raised the chances of an August rate rise after its chief economist joined two other members of its rate-setting monetary policy committee voting for an immediate hike in borrowing costs. For the first time since joining the MPC four years ago, Andy Haldane broke ranks with the majority on the nine member rate-setting panel to join Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders in calling for an increase in interest rates. The move is likely to heighten speculation that Threadneedle Street could be gearing up for a rise in two months\u2019 time. On the foreign exchanges, the pound, which had been down against the dollar at $1.31 before the announcement, rallied to $1.3220, a gain of half a cent. The latest rate decision comes after the Bank delayed raising the cost of borrowing last month amid the weakest readings of health for the economy in five years, which had been triggered by heavy snowfall. The \u201cbeast from the east\u201d meant cranes and diggers fell idle and forced shoppers to stay at home, causing growth to slow to 0.1% in the first three months of the year. The Bank said in May it thought the slowdown was a blip the economy would recover from and reiterated that view on Thursday. \u201cThis judgment appears broadly on track. A number of indicators of household spending and sentiment have bounced back strongly from what appeared to be erratic weakness,\u201d the MPC said. Although Mark Carney, the Bank\u2019s governor, was among the majority voting for rates to remain at 0.5% this month, the MPC said if the economy were to develop broadly in line with its projections, \u201can ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period would be appropriate\u201d. Haldane has disagreed publicly with the governor before. The last time a chief economist voted against the majority on the MPC was in 2011, when Spencer Dale held the post. Analysts said the split of three in favour versus six against will stoke speculation for an August interest rate rise, although much will depend on how the economy performs over the coming months. Ruth Gregory, the senior UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said the Bank could raise interest rates in August and again in November, taking the cost of borrowing to 1% before the end of the year. \u201cWe doubt that the MPC will sit on its hands for too much longer,\u201d she said. Having eased monetary policy to stimulate the economy and promote job creation after the financial crisis, including through \u00a3435bn of quantitative easing, the tone from the MPC\u2019s latest meeting continues the Bank on a path of slowly tightening the money supply just as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. Businesses warn this could be a risky strategy, given the uncertainty over the outcome for the talks with Brussels. Tej Parikh, a senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cThe MPC risks dampening confidence with a premature rate hike, particularly while political noise continues to bring uncertainty for businesses.\u201d Since its last meeting, Threadneedle Street also said it had reassessed the point at which it could begin reducing its quantitative easing bond buying programme. Instead of interest rates needing to rise to about 2% as the Bank had previously argued, they would now only need to reach about 1.5% it said, although the ultimate decision would depend on the strength of the economy. The interest rate decision comes before Carney gives his penultimate Mansion House speech in the City of London on Thursday night, alongside the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and it will also be watched closely for clues over the Bank\u2019s future policy decisions. Jeavon Lolay of Lloyds Bank said: \u201cThe surprising switch by Bank of England chief economist Haldane to support an immediate rate hike puts August firmly on the table. There will be even more interest in what governor Carney says tonight at the annual Mansion House speech.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The grilling by MPs of the bosses of Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s was painful. Not for Roger Burnley and Mike Coupe, but for poor viewers obliged to listen to Neil Parish \u2013 the verbose chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee \u2013 answer his own questions rather than try to extract useful information. It really shouldn\u2019t take 20 minutes to solve the non-mystery of why Burnley and Coupe reckon their combined share of the grocery market would be 25% while the rest of the world thinks 30% is nearer the mark. Burnley and Coupe are including Boots, B&amp;M Bargains and everybody who sells a sandwich or a bottle of detergent. Their numbers are cheeky but aren\u2019t hard to decipher. Nor does the precise figure matter terribly. The basic point remains: Tesco plus Asda/Sainsbury\u2019s would have 50%-60% of the market, depending on how tightly one defines the supermarket sector. It is a degree of dominance that would not be tolerated via acquisition in most important consumer markets. Is such a structure likely to operate against the interests of consumers and small suppliers? When the MPs finally got round to the question, they encountered Sainsbury\u2019s Coupe at his woolliest. He would seek to buy products from \u201cmultinationals\u201d at the lower of the two prices the chains secure separately today. Some of those savings would then go to consumers in the form of 10% price cuts on loosely defined \u201ceveryday\u201d items. But smaller suppliers wouldn\u2019t be squeezed, apparently, and, hey, some might even benefit from being able to sell to a bigger supermarket operator. This happy picture of a land where the nice folk win and only fat \u201cmultinationals\u201d lose rather ignores the fact that Nestl\u00e8, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever et al may not play ball. What if big suppliers, in turn, put pressure on their own primary producers, including UK farmers? What if Coupe can\u2019t deliver the \u00a3350m-a-year buying benefits he has promised the City?

Six months after he agreed to sell the bulk of 21st Century Fox to Disney, the bidder has upped its offer to $71.3bn (\u00a354bn), a monumental jump of nearly $20bn from its original all-share proposal. This time Disney is even offering to pay half in cash as it tries to see off Comcast\u2019s rival $65bn all-cash bid. The real worth of the Fox assets \u2013 including the film and TV studios, some US cable networks and the stake in Sky in the UK \u2013 clearly hasn\u2019t improved by 38% since last December. All that\u2019s happened is the depth of panic among big US media players that has been revealed. Nobody wants to be too small to confront the rise of Netflix. Fox, deemed to be the last significant asset in play, is the one they want. The rivalry between Disney\u2019s Bob Iger and Comcast\u2019s Brian Roberts merely adds spice to the action. For now, Fox prefers Disney\u2019s offer but reserves its right to switch sides if Comcast bids even higher. That is probably the way to bet since corporate ego, as much as cold financial calculation, is driving the action. You have to admire Murdoch\u2019s timing.

The only practical obstacle seems to be the technical one of giving the bookmakers enough time to re-programme the machines. But, since the experts are agreed the task could be completed in a fortnight, it can\u2019t be right to wait until 2020, which seems to be the official plan.

Not for Roger Burnley and Mike Coupe, but for poor viewers obliged to listen to Neil Parish \u2013 the verbose chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee \u2013 answer his own questions rather than try to extract useful information.</p> <p>It really shouldn\u2019t take 20 minutes to solve the non-mystery of why Burnley and Coupe reckon their combined share of the grocery market would be 25% while the rest of the world thinks 30% is nearer the mark. Burnley and Coupe are including Boots, B&amp;M Bargains and everybody who sells a sandwich or a bottle of detergent. Their numbers are cheeky but aren\u2019t hard to decipher.</p> <p>Nor does the precise figure matter terribly. The basic point remains: Tesco plus Asda/Sainsbury\u2019s would have 50%-60% of the market, depending on how tightly one defines the supermarket sector. It is a degree of dominance that would not be tolerated via acquisition in most important consumer markets. Is such a structure likely to operate against the interests of consumers and small suppliers?<br></p> <p>When the MPs finally got round to the question, they encountered Sainsbury\u2019s Coupe at his woolliest. He would seek to buy products from \u201cmultinationals\u201d at the lower of the two prices the chains secure separately today. Some of those savings would then go to consumers in the form of 10% price cuts on loosely defined \u201ceveryday\u201d items. But smaller suppliers wouldn\u2019t be squeezed, apparently, and, hey, some might even benefit from being able to sell to a bigger supermarket operator.</p> <p>This happy picture of a land where the nice folk win and only fat \u201cmultinationals\u201d lose rather ignores the fact that Nestl\u00e8, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever et al may not play ball. What if big suppliers, in turn, put pressure on their own primary producers, including UK farmers? What if Coupe can\u2019t deliver the \u00a3350m-a-year buying benefits he has promised the City? Would he then exploit the wriggle room in his \u201c10% off products I won\u2019t name in full\u201d pledge and try to extract the difference from shoppers?</p> <p>Let us hope the Competition and Markets Authority, led by former MP Andrew Tyrie, who knew how to run a select committee with more bite, secures clearer answers.

The German carmaker said on Wednesday night that it expected profits this year to be \u201cslightly below the previous year\u2019s level\u201d. It had previously pencilled in a slight rise. In a tit-for-tat response to the US moves, Beijing announced 25% import tariffs on $50bn of US products last week, including cars, which kick in on 6 July, following a similar move from Donald Trump. He threatened further tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods in retaliation. Daimler makes Mercedes SUVs in the US and ships them to China, its biggest market. BMW, which has large factories in the US, is also likely to be affected by the trade war. Shares in Daimler fell 3.3% on the Frankfurt stock exchange, while BMW lost 2.7% and Volkswagen 1.3%. Daimler sold record numbers of Mercedes cars in the first three months of the year, up 5% to 594,300 vehicles, thanks to strong demand from China, where sales increased by 16% to 178,000 cars. However, this is unlikely to last because of the trade spat, the carmaker warned. Daimler said: \u201cThe decisive factor is that, at Mercedes-Benz Cars, fewer than expected SUV sales and higher than expected costs \u2013 not completely passed on to the customers \u2013 must be assumed because of increased import tariffs for US vehicles into the Chinese market. This effect cannot be fully compensated by the reallocation of vehicles to other markets.\u201d The company said sales would also be affected by the new certification process for emissions tests, which takes effect in September. It is also being hit by a previously announced recall of Mercedes diesel vans and declining demand for Daimler buses in Latin America.",

      "bodyText": "The new Dixons Carphone boss, Alex Baldock, has underlined his warning that fixing the retailer\u2019s problems will take time, as he reported a 24% plunge in profits. The UK electricals and mobile phone retailer, which disclosed a huge data breach last week, has been hit by the lack of technical innovation in mobile phones, meaning customers are updating their handsets less frequently. Many are also switching to cheaper sim-only deals. Dixons made an underlying pre-tax profit of \u00a3382m for the year to 28 April, down from \u00a3500m the previous year. It had already flagged the fall last month, along with the warning that current-year profits will slide by a further 20%. Like-for-like revenues in the UK and Ireland rose 2%, while group like-for-like revenues were up 4%, boosted by strong growth in Scandinavia and Greece. UK mobile phone sales were flat on a like-for-like basis. Baldock, who took over as chief executive from Seb James in April, said: \u201cRecent events have underlined that we have plenty of work to do, and it will take time, but I\u2019m even more confident than the day I took the job in our long-term prospects.\u201d Dixons is closing 92 Carphone Warehouse stores this year as it adapts to a changing mobile phone market and rising costs. It has blamed the fall in the value of the pound in the wake of Brexit for driving up the cost of mobile phone handsets. The group said there was no update on its recent data breach, one of the biggest to occur in Britain, involving unauthorised access to 5.9 million Dixons customers\u2019 cards and to 1.2m personal records of customers. A branch of GCHQ, Britain\u2019s intelligence and security service, is investigating the attack alongside the retailer and other agencies. Patrick O\u2019Brien, the UK retail research director at Global Data, said of the store closures: \u201cHow much of those sales can be retained through its other stores and online channel will be pivotal in deciding what to do with the remainder. With EE, O2 and Vodafone on every high street, retaining sales will be difficult. \u201cIn the coming months, Baldock has the tricky contract renegotiations with those carriers to deal with. He believes that its capital intensive model needs to change and that the profitability of those contracts needs to improve. However, mobile contracts sold through third parties are the least profitable for the networks and there is even the possibility of one or more pulling out of Carphone Warehouse entirely. Vodafone did exactly this in 2006.\u201d",
