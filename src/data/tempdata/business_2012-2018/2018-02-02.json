      "bodyText": "New York traders will be catching their breath and counting their losses after this week\u2019s declines. So, here\u2019s our updated news story on the markets today: Wall Street ended its worst week in two years on Friday with another sharp fall as markets in Europe also continued to tumble from the record-high levels reached less than a month ago. Investors headed for the exits amid growing fears over a bond market rout, triggered by early signs of inflation in the US as economic growth accelerates and wages appear to finally be rising after years of stagnation. US government bond yields, which rise as prices fall, hit the highest level since January 2014. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665 points to end the day down more than 2.5% and falling below 26,000, the record level it hit on 17 January. The sell-off came after the US labor department released a better than expected monthly jobs report, sparking fears of a sharper rise in interest rates. It was the first time since June 2016 that the Dow had fallen more than 500 points. Here\u2019s the full story: That\u2019s probably all from us for this week. Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! Bitcoin, incidentally, is still off its earlier lows. It\u2019s down 5% today at $8,556. The Dow finished 665.75 points lower. So it you round it down..... Each of the 30 companies on the Dow fell today. The worst performers were Chevron (-5.5%), Exxon (-5.1%) and Goldman Sachs (-4.5%). Tech stocks also had a bad day, with Apple down 4.3%. Over on the Nasdaq (which lost 2%), Alphabet slid by 5% after Google\u2019s parent company missed expectations with its financial results last night. What caused the selloff? There are several factors, but the most significant may be today\u2019s jobs report - showing wages rose by 2.9% over the last year. That increase in earnings could push up inflation, forcing US interest rates higher. It was a poor week for the S&amp;P 500 (a broader stock market index than the Dow) Traders on Wall Street will be nursing bruises; the Dow has lost 1,095 point this week. This looks like the third-biggest one-day points decline on the Dow ever! It also looks like the biggest points decline since the aftermath of Lehman Brothers collapse. However, it\u2019s not that historic. In percentage terms, today\u2019s falls are much less dramatic - but still a concern... NEWSFLASH: The US stock market has recorded its worst week in two years, after a wave of selling hit Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has tumbled by almost 670 points, or 2.5%. That\u2019s the biggest percentage fall since June 2016, the day after the Brexit vote, and means the Dow has shed over 1,000 points this week. One important point - a 600-point plunge isn\u2019t what it used to be, due to the strong market rally over the last 15 month. Wall Street is staggering towards the finishing line.... with five minutes to go, the Dow is down 675 points or 2,5%. Inflation fears, worries about the bond market, and rising political tensions are all hitting the markets today, according to CNN\u2019s latest market report. Ken Odeluga, market analyst with City Index in London says: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a smorgasbord of negativity...It\u2019s been pretty nervous all week.\u201d Earlier today, president Trump approved the release of a memo alleging that the FBI had been biased against Trump over their investigations into possible Russian interference in the US elections. That move is weighing on investors, according to Ian Winer, head of equities at Wedbush Securities. He warns: There looks like a breakdown of the institutions in our country. \u201cNo matter what side you\u2019re on, that\u2019s not good.\u201d The Dow is now at a three-week low: Make that a 624-point fall...! Heading into the last hour of trading, the Dow is now down 576 points, or 2.2%. This could be the US stock market\u2019s worst day since the aftermath of the Brexit vote.... The selloff is gathering speed! The Dow Jones industrial average is now down by 500 points, or almost 2%. Oil giant Exxon is still the biggest faller, down 5.5%, followed by Chevron (-4.1%) and Apple (-3.4%). Investors seem to be increasingly spooked by the prospect of US interest rate rises, following today\u2019s decent US jobs report - which showed a pick-up in hiring and wages. Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, explains: A big wage growth number is the biggest risk to the stock market rally, because it means the Fed may get more aggressive in raising interest rates. Here are a few photos from Wall Street, as traders try to keep pace with today\u2019s selloff: Here\u2019s our colleague Richard Partington on the stock market losses today: Wall Street was heading for its worst week in two years on Friday as markets in Europe also continued to tumble from record-high levels reached less than a month ago. Investors headed for the exits amid growing fears over a bond market rout, triggered by early signs of inflation in the US as economic growth accelerates. US government bond yields, which rise as prices fall, hit the highest level since January 2014. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 400 points in early trading in New York, hitting a low of 25,787. Amid a widespread sell-off, the biggest fallers were Apple, Visa and oil firms Exxon and Chevron. In Europe, the FTSE 100 recorded its worst week since April last year when Theresa May called the snap election, dropping by 47 points to 7,443, while Germany\u2019s Dax fell 1.7%. The worst week for stocks under Donald Trump comes after one of the best years in history for shares in 2017 and just a week after the Dow hit a record high of 26,617. More here: With two and a half hours trading to go, Wall Street is solidly in the red. The Dow is down 1.5%, or almost 400 points, at 25,789 points. The wider S&amp;P 500 is off 1.1%, while the Nasdaq has lost almost 1%. Given the losses earlier this week, Marketwatch agrees that we\u2019re on track for the worst weekly losses in two years. The markets in Mexico, Brazil and Canada are also having a bad day.... US wages may be growing, but so is inequality, says Dominic Rushe It\u2019s been a long, slow recovery for US workers but wages finally appear to be growing again, according to the latest jobs report released on Friday. But behind the headline rate the figures show \u2013 once more \u2013 that inequality is on the rise. On Friday the labor department released its latest monthly jobs update. The US added 200,000 new positions in January, higher than expected, but the real surprise was in wage growth. Hourly earnings rose 0.3% in January, enough to lift the annual rate up to 2.9%. \u201cThis may be the start of a welcome trend in wage gains, and marks the highest percentage increase in average hourly earnings since 2009,\u201d said US secretary of labour Alexander Acosta. A tightening labour market and unemployment at 4.1% (a 17-year low) appears finally to be making its way into people\u2019s pockets as employers are forced to raise wages in order to attract talent. But the big numbers hide an ominous trend. For many Americans, slow wage growth isn\u2019t just a hangover of the post-2008 \u201cgreat recession\u201d. For those without a college degree the sluggish rate of growth can be traced back to the 1970s, and the more recent slump deepened that inequality. The full report is here: It was a bad day all round for global markets. The FTSE 100, as we mentioned earlier, has suffered its worst week since last April With poor results from Deutsche Bank to add to those of Daimler earlier this week, Germany\u2019s Dax has also dropped sharply, recording its biggest weekly fall since February 2016. And Wall Street continues to come under the cosh, as the better than expected jobs and confidence numbers add to the belief that interest rises are on the way. Investors have begun to take seriously the fact that central banks are removing the financial punchbowl which has powered markets for the past few years, and perhaps at a faster pace than had been expected. The final scores in Europe showed: The FTSE 100 fell 46.96 points or 0.63% to 7443.43 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 1.68% to 12,785.16 France\u2019s Cac closed 1.64% lower at 5364.98 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished down 1.44% at 23,202.66 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.81% lower at 10,211.2 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 358 points or 1.37%. Wall Street\u2019s slide continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 384 points. The FTSE 100 has closed down 0.63% at 7443.43, as part of the day\u2019s global market sell 0ff. The UK\u2019s leading index is down 2.9%, making it the worst weekly performance since 21 April last year when it lost....2.91%. That incidentally was the week Theresa May decided to call a snap UK general election. Happy days. A quick summary of how bad it has been this week for US markets: Back with bitcoin, and it has been through the classic rollercoaster ride today. Having fallen as low as $7625 it is now actually in positive territory for the day, up 0.12% at $9010. More on the disparities in the US wage growth data: Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said\u201d The US open made a miserable day all the worse for the European markets, while Bitcoin managed to pull back from the brink. Following Wednesday\u2019s hawkish hold from the Federal Reserve, there was arguably more interest in this non-farm Friday than there has been for a while. And, luckily for the ailing dollar, the numbers didn\u2019t disappoint: the headline figure came in at 200k, far higher than both the 181k expected and the 160k posted in January, with wage growth also outperforming forecasts to remain unchanged at 0.3%. This, alongside a better than expected consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan, allowed the dollar to regain some ground lost this week. Against the pound the greenback rose 1%, sending cable back below $1.413, while against the euro the dollar jumped 0.7%, taking the currency away from yesterday\u2019s $1.25-crossing 3 and a bit year peak. All this hawkishness was toxic for the Dow Jones, which plunged 300 points once the bell rang on Wall Street to hit 25900 for the first time in over a fortnight. This Dow drop only exacerbated the losses in Europe; the DAX and CAC both fell 1.3%, with the former on track for its worst close since September last year, while the FTSE slipped 0.7% to strike a sub-7450, near 8 week nadir. As for Bitcoin, while things are still bad, they are nowhere near as disastrous as they were at lunchtime. It had at one point found itself trading at $7750, a price not seen since the end of November, only for a wave of buyers to rescue it from those lows and send it back above $8650. Still, it\u2019s certainly been a week to forget for the cryptocurrency, with a hat-trick of bad news \u2013 a shift in regulations in South Korea, a Facebook ban on ads for the product, and an investigation by the US CFTC \u2013 causing it to shed around $3000 per Bitcoin. With the dollar recovering in the expectation of an imminent US interest rate rise, the pound has lost some of its recent gains. Sterling is down more than 1% on the day against the dollar to $1.4119, its biggest daily fall since November last year. The university of Michigan\u2019 survey may have come in better than expected but it did show the consumer sentiment index at its lowest level since September. However chief economist Richard Curtin was positive about the overall picture: Consumer sentiment has remained largely unchanged for more than a year at very favorable levels. The January Sentiment figure was just 0.2 Index-points below December\u2019s, and just 1.1 points below the 2017 average of 96.8--which was the highest yearly average since 2000. Stock price increases and the passage of tax reforms were mentioned by all-time record numbers of consumers. To be sure, there were small offsetting declines among lower income households and residents of the Northeast. Consumers continued to expect growth in jobs and incomes, but anticipated a slightly higher inflation rate. Importantly, the motivating force behind purchase decisions has shifted from discounts on prices and interest rates to increased confidence in future job security and growth in wages as well as financial assets. This renewed sense of confidence was responsible for the recent declines in savings rates. he tax cuts will increase discretionary spending once higher energy bills due to the unusually cold weather are paid. Monetary policy will need to tighten in the year ahead, but given consumers\u2019 decade long experience with record low interest rates, only modest increases in interest rates will be sufficient to curb any excesses. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.8% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018. The upbeat consumer confidence figures have sent Wall Street even lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 300 points or more than 1.1%. More positive news for the US economy, adding to the belief that the Federal Reserve will be ready to raise interest rates next month. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 95.7 in January, up from an initial reading of 94.4 and better than the expected figure of 95. It was however slightly lower than December\u2019s final reading of 95.9. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, suggests the slump in bitcoin could be one of the reasons for the current weakness in global stock markets: Markets participants found themselves in the rare position of witnessing falling prices this week. It has naturally sparked questions of whether a larger correction is in store. The Dow Jones has pulled back 3% while the FTSE 100 has dropped nearly 4.5%. These are relatively small moves and based on recent experience, the mostly likely scenario is dip-buyers step in to send markets back up again. However, maybe this time will be different. The market has reached some new extremes in sentiment during January and certain risk-factors, notably the rise in bond yields, could point to further stock market declines. It\u2019s conceivable that the Bitcoin bubble bursting has meant retail equity investors were meeting less margin calls. Rising bond yields have put stock markets on high alert. 2.6% was the first \u2018worry level\u2019 in 10-year US treasuries. A 3% 10-year treasury yield is the big kahuna for a larger stock market correction. After many stops and starts in US interest rate rises, investors increasingly seem to be feeling like this tightening cycle could be here to stay. The phenomenon is global though. The UK gilt yield has hit its highest since May 2016. India\u2019s 10-year bond yield hit a fresh 22-month high. Rising interest rates mean the \u2018goldilocks\u2019 scenario for markets is warming up to \u2018daddy bear\u2019. As expected US markets are in negative territory after the better than expected jobs figures gave a boost to the flagging dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently down 217 points or 0.8%, on track for its worst weekly performance since January 2016..The S&amp;P 500 opened down 0.6% while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.55% lower. The rise in average earnings is not spread across the board: Here are the jobs data charts: Pantheon economist Ian Shepherdson reckons the jobs data should be good for shares. Wall Street futures have improved as we approach the opening of the US market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is now forecast to open around 200 points lower, better than the 250 loss predicted in the immediate aftermath of the better than expected jobs figures. Kully Samra, UK managing director at Charles Schwab expects US rate rises this year. And increased market volatility: The US economy started 2018 on a positive note as the labour market continues to tighten. This latest set of job numbers supports the view that that some of the weakness in December\u2019s service-providing industries would revert in January. Tightening labour market conditions and indications of a pickup in wage growth will be welcomed by the Fed which has expressed concern over benign inflation. While the Fed held interest rates steady on Wednesday, we expect a hike in March as Jerome Powell is expected to continue down the familiar path of keeping inflation under control without raising rates so far or so fast as to stifle the improvement in growth expected this year. We continue to believe the Fed will hike rates at least three times this year and that, along with the paring of its balance sheet, historically-low financial conditions may start to tighten. However, with the outlook for inflation continuing to be carefully monitored, we do expect a higher level of volatility in the stock market this year relative to 2017. The big picture is that America\u2019s economy has been creating jobs each month since early into Barack Obama\u2019s first term, and it\u2019s held steady under Donald Trump too. The upbeat US jobs figures makes it likely there will be an interest rate rise in March barring unforeseen circumstances, according to ING Bank. Economist James Knightley says: The US jobs report is very strong with payrolls rising 200,000 versus expectations of 180,000. There were some chunky upward revisions too, but the big story is wage growth which looks much, much better. Wages are now growing 2.9% year on year (the fastest rate of growth since 2009) with last month\u2019s figure revised up to 2.7% from 2.5%. Unemployment stays at 4.1%, but given the strength of this report it is hard to argue against a March Fed rate hike now. Wage growth has been the missing link in the strong economic growth, tight jobs market story. We have been hoping for some time to see a turnaround and it does finally look as though something is happening. It backs up evidence from yesterday\u2019s National Federation of Independent Businesses small business survey, which showed the net proportion of businesses raising worker compensation is at its highest since 2000. The report also showed you have to go all the way back to 1989 to find when the index indicating the net proportion of businesses that plan to raise worker pay was higher. Given companies such as WalMart have credited Trump\u2019s tax cuts as a way for them to afford higher worker pay we suspect we will see the wage numbers pick-up further. Rising wages and robust economic growth is also supportive for our 3% headline CPI call for this summer. Consequently, it will need a big shock to prevent the Fed from hiking in March, but it could happen in the form of a damaging government shutdown should politicians fail to resolve their differences \u2013 next deadline is February 8. Nonetheless, it looks more and more likely that we will have to revise up our call for three Fed rate hikes this year to four. US firms are facing a real scramble to find staff to hire, reckons Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM. President Trump will probably enjoy today\u2019s jobs report, says Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com: \u201cWhile criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s embattled White House continues to mount, job growth continues to go through the gears, with the latest nonfarm payroll figures proving job creation remains a competence within the president\u2019s capabilities. \u201cBuoyant domestic and global demand, particularly for the manufacturing sector, appear the drivers in higher-than-anticipated numbers, and Trump\u2019s fiscal stimulus package is clearly a shot in the arm for economic growth. \u201cHowever, with the economy close to full employment, increased pressure on wages looks an inevitable consequence. So higher inflation is surely on the cards, with taller interest rates set to arrive over the coming months.\u201d A good jobs report = falling shares and bonds. That\u2019s because traders suspect it means US interest rates will rise faster than expected, as inflation worries encourage central bankers to empty the \u2018punch bowl\u2019 of loose monetary policy. Financial experts like the look of today\u2019s US labor market report. This is from Christopher Vecchio of DailyFX.com: Jeremy Cook of World First and Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Economics are both impressed by the wage growth: Bloomberg\u2019s Jeanna Smialek suggests that the Phillips curve may not be dead after all (the idea that inflation rises when unemployment falls). Economist Shaun Richards has spotted that bars and restaurants hired more staff last month: The dollar has climbed and US bond yields have risen following the better then expected jobs and wages figures. But the expected opening losses on Wall Street have increased according to the future market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to open down around 250 points. Before the jobs data it was around 220 points lower. The dollar index has risen 0.3% to 88.95 while 10 year Treasury yields have hit a near four year high at 2.818%. And the price of 30 year bonds has fallen more than a point with yields at their highest level since March 2017. BREAKING: The US economy created 200,000 new jobs last month, a little more than Wall Street had expected. December\u2019s figure have been revised up too, to 160,000 new jobs (from 146,000). The US jobless rate remains at 4.1%, a 17-year low. Wages rose too, by 0.3% during the month and a healthy 2.9% year-on-year (that\u2019s average hourly earnings) It looks like a pretty decent jobs report, at first glance. Well, this rather sums up the crypto bubble. Long Blockchain Corp -- formally known as Long Island Iced Tea -- has announced that it has abandoned plans to buy bitcoin mining equipment. Long Island rebranded itself as a \u2018blockchain\u2019 company late last year, a move that caused its share price to quadruple. It is pressing on with its proposed merger with technology companyStater Blockchain Limited, but has ditched plans to buy \u201c1,000 Antminer S9 mining rigs\u201d to mine new bitcoins. More here.... Tension is building in the markets as investors brace for America\u2019s jobs report, due at 8.30am East Coast time (1.30pm in the UK). As usual, Wall Street experts have a range of predictions. The consensus is that 180,000 new jobs were created in January. But it\u2019s the wage growth figures that could move the markets; a (welcome) rise in earnings would make US interest rate rises more likely -- potentially bad news for bond prices and shares too. Here\u2019s our news story on bitcoin\u2019s slide, and Nouriel Roubini\u2019s concerns:: Hold onto your hats. Bitcoin is clambering off the mat, and bouncing back to $8,500. That\u2019s still a 5% loss today, though... This is turning into a rather bad day for digital currencies. Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin et al are all suffering double-digit losses. Despite the recent plunge, bitcoin is still worth rather more than a year ago.... Bitcoin is being hit by two different issues (as explained earlier). Firstly, you have the growing threat of regulation, with India\u2019s finance minister pledging yesterday to \u2018eliminate\u2019 the use of digital currencies by criminals. That follows similar similar warnings from politicians in the UK, US and South Korea. Secondly, you have the investigation into Bitfinex (a leading digital currency exchange), and crypto firm tether. Regulators are questioning whether tether, whose coins are used to trade digital currency, are actually fully backed by US dollars as it claims. As Bloomberg explains: Tether\u2019s coins have become a popular substitute for dollars on cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, with about $2.3 billion of the tokens outstanding as of Tuesday. While Tether has said all of its coins are backed by U.S. dollars held in reserve, the company has yet to provide conclusive evidence of its holdings to the public or have its accounts audited. Skeptics have questioned whether the money is really there. This double-dose of bad news is sparking a rout across the sector, sending bitcoin sliding through $8,000 (it\u2019s $7,888 right now). Neil Wilson of ETX Capital reckons that \u201cthe wheels are coming off the bitcoin bandwagon\u201d. The regulatory crunch appears closer than ever and sooner or later this market could be headed back down to earth. Selling pressure at the moment is intense as there has been nothing but bad news for bitcoin bulls of late. The key concern facing the bulls is the CFTC investigation into Tether and the Bitfinex exchange. Claims of full dollar convertibility are under scrutiny. Given there are about 2bn tether coins in existence, there should be a $2bn account somewhere but Tether has yet to prove it or have accounts audited. The idea that Tether is creating coins to buy bitcoin is straight out of satire. If bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then this is Ponzi squared; printing fake money to buy a different type of fake money in order to ramp up the price of the latter. If it weren\u2019t likely to cause real world losses for many investors it would be hilarious. Meanwhile, we see the jaws of the regulatory crunch closing on other fronts with moves to ban or greatly restrict trading on bitcoin gaining traction worldwide. Ultimately if the CFTC decides bitcoin prices have been manipulated it casts a huge shadow of bitcoin and entire crypto market. At Davos last week, a series of experts cast doubt over bitcoin -- those predictions seem to be being born out today.... Ouch! Bitcoin has just tumbled through the $8,000 mark. It\u2019s now trading at $7985 on the Bitstamp exchange, down over 11% this morning as volatile trading continues to rock the digital currency sector. This inflicts further losses on those who bought into bitcoin late last year. Bitcoin has now lost around 40% of its value this year (bitcoin started the New Year at $13,880), and 60% since its all-time peak in December. The US stock market is heading for another bath. The Dow Jones is being called down around 220 points, or 0.8%, amid nervousness ahead of today\u2019s non-farm payroll jobs report. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 index is now down 1.1% - and facing its biggest weekly loss since the US presidential election in November 2016. In London, the FTSE 100 is extending its recent losses. It\u2019s down another 28 points, or 0.3%, at 7461, its lowest level since 15 December. Investors are ignoring last night\u2019s strong results from Amazon, in favour of fretting about the bond market again. Bond yields (which rise when prices fall) are climbing, on the back of concerns that Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts will drive up US borrowing. Craig Erlam of City firm OANDA says trading is \u201crocky\u201d in Europe today. He points to the volatility in the bond market, where UK and German government debt has weakened: Gilt yields are at their highest since May 2015 and Bunds at their highest since September 2015. This may well be contributing to the declines we\u2019ve seen recently across Europe \u2013 along with the corresponding appreciation of the euro and pound \u2013 and could now be taking its toll on US stocks. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we\u2019ve entered a risk-off period or that stocks are headed for a correction but a sharp rise in yields, as we\u2019ve seen, can also weigh on equity markets. The FT has a good take on the anxiety in the bond markets: The US is heading into some of its biggest budget deficits outside of wars and recessions as Congress debates increasing ceilings on federal spending on top of December\u2019s trillion-dollar tax cuts. Lawmakers are contemplating lifting caps on defence and non-defence spending as they seek a funding deal in coming weeks. The Bipartisan Policy Center, a non-partisan think-tank, predicts that Congress will settle on plans that drive the deficit to 5.7 per cent of US gross domestic product in 2019 as annual borrowing exceeds $1.1tn. That would be well short of deficits as a share of GDP reached after the Great Recession or the second world war. But it would be comparable to the shortfall after the recession of the early 1980s under Ronald Reagan, even though the US is now at or beyond full employment and the global economy is in its strongest upswing in a decade. More here: Economists warn of Trump deficit\u2019s \u2018dark trajectory\u2019 Germany\u2019s Dax index has now shed all 2018\u2019s gains, dragged down partly by Deutsche Bank after its disappointing results. Economics professor Nouriel Roubini has just been on Bloomberg TV, blasting bitcoin as the \u201cbiggest Ponzi scheme in human history\u201d. Roubini claims that \u201ccharlatans and swindlers\u201d drove digital currencies to record levels last year, before cashing their profits. Ordinary punters, who bought bitcoin when it was trading around $20,000, have lost 60% of their shirts since, says Roubini. Here\u2019s Rob Davies on the job losses at Carillion: There\u2019s a good piece in the New Statesman today about the problems in Britain\u2019s outsourcing sector, and the lessons to be learned. In it, Grace Blakeley argues that the demise of Carillion, and Capita\u2019s financial problems, show that the outsourcing market is failing, and must change. Blakeley says: Firstly, rather than granting contracts to a small number of huge multinationals which then commission other, smaller specialist firms to do the work, the government should get rid of the middle man and deal with suppliers directly. This would boost small businesses, and tackle the uncompetitive nature of the current outsourcing market. It would also protect the government from another Carillion crisis. Secondly, public contracts should not be awarded solely on the basis of \u201cvalue for money\u201d. Government contracts should be seen as an opportunity to create public value \u2013 where value is understood in holistic rather than narrow economistic terms. The government should account for the wider economic and social impact of its suppliers when determining which supplier should be awarded a particular contract. The Labour party\u2019s proposals to account for the quantity and quality of employment created by a supplier, the nature of its corporate governance, its environmental impact and its attitude towards tax suggests how this could be done. Thirdly, we need to call time on private financing. If the government wants to build a major infrastructure project it should do so through historically cheap public borrowing, on the public balance sheet, justifying the investment based on the economic, social, or environmental impact. Good public investment done well more than pays for itself in the long run. It should also expand its definition of investment to include investment in human as well as physical capital \u2013 spending on healthcare and education is just as much of an investment in the long-run economic capacity of this country as investments in roads and bridges. More here: The problem with outsourcing is not Carillion but the market itself NEWSFLASH: Nearly 400 Carillion staff have just been made redundant, following its fall into liquidation last month. The Official Receiver says it has managed to save more than 900 jobs, but 377 more have lost their jobs. They\u2019re now being told to contact the JobCentre. The employees whose jobs have been saved work on \u201cinfrastructure, central and local government, and construction contracts\u201d. They are now being transferred to new employees who have taken on these contracts. Carillion employed almost 20,000 staff in the UK, so thousands more Carillion workers still face an uncertain future. A spokesperson for the Official Receiver says: \u201cAs part of the ongoing liquidation of the Carillion group I am pleased we have been able to safeguard the jobs of 919 employees today. Most staff are transferring on existing or similar terms and I will continue to facilitate this wherever possible as we work to find new providers for Carillion\u2019s other contracts. \u201cDespite best efforts it has not been possible to secure the jobs of 377 staff, who will be made redundant. Those affected will be entitled to make a claim for statutory redundancy payments. The Jobcentre Plus\u2019 Rapid Response Service stands ready to support any of these employees by providing advice and information so people can move into a new job as quickly as possible. \u201cI recognise that this will be a worrying time for all those affected, their families and local communities. I would like to thank all staff for their professionalism throughout the liquidation. \u201cI am expecting many employees working on other Carillion contracts to transfer in the coming weeks and we are continuing to keep the workforce updated as these are arrangements are finalised.\u201d Noble Francis, economics director at the Construction Products Association, fears that we haven\u2019t seen the full impact of Carillion\u2019s collapse yet. Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply says political and economic uncertainty is hitting the UK construction sector, pushing it towards stagnation. \u201cThe blocks to progress included a sharp rise in costs and a shortage of key materials, which contributed to longer lead times as supplier capabilities were stretched to their limits. \u201cAgainst this challenging backdrop, though larger orders from cautious clients also failed to materialise, firms retained a sunny disposition with optimism at a seven-month high and a slight rise in employment continued. \u201cWith construction teetering on the edge of contraction, this surprise outcome will serve as a jolt to policymakers, that the impact of political and economic uncertainty remains large at the beginning of 2018.\u201d Sam Teague, Economist at IHS Markit, says there wasn\u2019t much New Year cheer in the building sector: \u201cJanuary\u2019s PMI data indicated a difficult start to 2018 for the UK\u2019s construction sector, underlined by business activity growth slumping to a four-month low and new orders sliding back into decline. \u201cA contraction in house building added to lacklustre commercial building and civil engineering markets, and reduced inflows of new work suggest overall activity could slip into decline in February. Furthermore, cost pressures remained intense, fuelled by shortages of input materials and high costs for imported products. Max Jones, global corporates relationship director for construction at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, says the collapse of Carillion has hit the construction sector. Jones explains: \u201cIt has clearly been a month like no other for the sector, so this drop in the PMI reading comes as no major surprise. \u201cThe impact of Carillion\u2019s liquidation has rippled down the supply chain and shaken confidence across the industry. There have inevitably been fears for the sub-contractors with exposure to the collapse, though some have drawn down on emergency support from banks, including the \u00a350m Lloyds fund. Tens of thousands of small construction companies, and other suppliers, across the UK were hit by Carillion\u2019s shock liquidation in early January. Work was halted at two major hospitals, while other firms were forced to lay off staff as they\u2019re unlikely to be paid for work carried out for Carillion. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s construction industry has slowed to near stagnation, and housebuilding is in decline. Data firm Markit reports that UK building companies experienced a \u201csubdued start to 2018\u201d, with total industry activity barely rising. Its monthly construction PMI, which measures activity, dropped to just 50.2 for January from 52.2 in December. That\u2019s worryingly closed to the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. In another blow, housebuilding activity shrank - while civil engineering work picked up. Job creation across the construction industry also slowed, to an 18-month low. That\u2019s a fresh hit to apprentices already reeling from the collapse of Carillion last month. Markit says: A return to contraction in residential building activity was accompanied by near-stagnant commercial and civil engineering activity. New orders declined, linked by many companies to market uncertainty. On a more positive note, confidence towards future growth prospects improved, with many firms anticipating an increase in new project wins later in the year. More to follow... This is turning into bitcoin\u2019s worst week since 2013.... Of course, bitcoin has always bounced back from its previous slumps (five years ago it was worth just $20). But is this time different?.... Telecoms group BT is also having a bad morning. Shares have fallen over 5% to 241.3p, a five-year low, after some underwhelming results this morning. Profits over the last nine months are down 9%, and the company has also reported a fall in TV customers - despite splashing out on live Ashes coverage (given England\u2019s performance, perhaps they should have spared us....) My colleague Mark Sweney points out that BT\u2019s consumer division seems to be slowing, while its IT services division continues to struggle.... At the risk of labouring the point..... Economics professor Nouriel Roubini says the \u2018mother of all bubbles\u2019 is now deflating fast: European stock markets are on the back foot again this morning, with losses across the board. Germany\u2019s DAX is the worst performer. It\u2019s being dragged down by Deutsche Bank, which has lost almost 6% after reporting a \u20ac497m loss for 2017 (alongside that $70m fine) Here\u2019s Naeem Aslam of Think Markets on bitcoin\u2019s decline: Bitcoin below 10K tells you only one message which is the upward momentum has died out and the odds are that we would continue to consolidate or grind lower. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx agrees that bitcoin is firmly on the back foot. The biggest story this Friday didn\u2019t belong to the traditional markets, however, but Bitcoin. Opening Monday at $11700 \u2013 remember at its 2017 it hit $20000 \u2013 it is now struggling to keep its head above $8400, following a week that dealt blow after blow to the cryptocurrency. First there was the introduction of new regulations on anonymous trading accounts in South Korea, one of Bitcoin\u2019s biggest markets, followed by reports that Facebook would be banning cryptocurrency adverts on its site. Now comes the news that Bitcoin\u2019s pre-Christmas rise is being investigated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for market manipulation, closing out a horrible few days for the previously ascendant product. Deutsche Bank has been fined $70m (\u00a349m) by US regulators for attempting to rig a benchmark for interest-rate derivatives and other financial instruments. The bank agreed the settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after investigators found traders sought to manipulate rates from 2007 until May 2012. It is alleged the bank\u2019s staff knew they were breaking the law, with one trader telling a broker that \u201ca lot of people would actually do jail time\u201d if practices were exposed. James McDonald, the CFTC\u2019s director of enforcement, said: \u201cThere is no room in our markets for manipulation. We will continue to work hard to stamp it out, wherever we find it.\u201d A spokesperson for Deutsche Bank said it had co-operated with the investigation and had \u201cundertaken significant efforts to remediate benchmark-related activities\u201d. Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets reckons bitcoin is following a familiar pattern: Miles Eakers, chief market analyst at Centtrip, says Bitcoin has made a \u201cwoeful\u201d start to the new year. \u201cThe drop followed comments made by India\u2019s Minister of Finance, Arun Jaitley, that the Indian government \u2018does not consider cryptocurrencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system\u2019. \u201cWe anticipate there will be more of such protectionist regulation. This is likely to put Bitcoin under more strain, causing it to drop to the $8000 a coin level.\u201d January was a cruel month for digital currency fans, and February isn\u2019t turning out much better. Bitcoin has fallen by 5% this morning to $8,521, its lowest level since late November. That means it\u2019s lost more than half its value since peaking near $20,000 in the week before Christmas. The selloff follows reports that American regulators are investigating whether last autumn\u2019s price surge had been caused by market manipulation. According to Bloomberg, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been investigating the Bitfinex exchange and a cryptocurrency company called Tether. Fortune Magazine has a good explanation: Specifically, regulators are curious about Bitfinex\u2019s relationship with virtual currency Tether, which the exchange claims is pegged to the dollar. So in theory, one dollar equals one Tether. Tether has become a popular way for some investors to buy Bitcoin on exchanges. But the CFTC\u2019s probe feeds into worries that Tether may not be actually backed by the dollar, as Bitfinex has provided little proof of the relationship, critics say. That hazy relationship has fueled concerns that Bitfinex may be simply creating Tether coins out of thin air and using Tether to buy Bitcoin\u2014thereby propping up the price of the latter asset. Digital currencies have also been hit by the news that Facebook is banning all adverts for cryptocurrencies. India\u2019s finance minister added to their woes, by saying his country doesn\u2019t accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender and pledging to fight their use for \u201cillegitimate activities\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how America\u2019s labour market is faring, when January\u2019s non-farm payroll is released. Economists predict that around 180,000 new jobs were created last month, up from December\u2019s disappointing 148,000 (which might get revised today). That should leave the jobless rate at just 4.1%, which is a 17-year low, although it could possibly drop to just 4.0%. If so, expect some gleeful tweeting from President Trump...... The key issue, though, is whether wage growth picked up. It could rise to 2.6% from last month\u2019s 2.5%, which could fuel expectations of higher inflation in America. Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics says: The tightening labour market is yet to put much upward pressure on wage growth, but with core inflation now starting to rebound we suspect that average hourly earnings will not be far behind. Signs of inflationary pressures have already been hitting the bond market in recent days, sending prices down and yields to their highest level in several years. So we could see more action there today. Meanwhile in the UK, we get a new health check on Britain\u2019s building sector. Markit\u2019s Construction PMI report is expected to show that growth slowed a little in January. We\u2019ve also got financial results from BT and Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank (more shortly....) European stock markets are expected to open a little lower, led by Germany\u2019s Dax. Here\u2019s the agenda. 9.30am GMT: UK Construction PMI for January 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payroll jobs report 3pm GMT: University of Michigan\u2019s survey of US consumer sentiment",

And, luckily for the ailing dollar, the numbers didn\u2019t disappoint: the headline figure came in at 200k, far higher than both the 181k expected and the 160k posted in January, with wage growth also outperforming forecasts to remain unchanged at 0.3%. </p> <p>This, alongside a better than expected consumer sentiment reading from the University of Michigan, allowed the dollar to regain some ground lost this week. Against the pound the greenback rose 1%, sending cable back below $1.413, while against the euro the dollar jumped 0.7%, taking the currency away from yesterday\u2019s $1.25-crossing 3 and a bit year peak. </p> <p>All this hawkishness was toxic for the Dow Jones, which plunged 300 points once the bell rang on Wall Street to hit 25900 for the first time in over a fortnight. This Dow drop only exacerbated the losses in Europe; the DAX and CAC both fell 1.3%, with the former on track for its worst close since September last year, while the FTSE slipped 0.7% to strike a sub-7450, near 8 week nadir. </p> <p>As for Bitcoin, while things are still bad, they are nowhere near as disastrous as they were at lunchtime. It had at one point found itself trading at $7750, a price not seen since the end of November, only for a wave of buyers to rescue it from those lows and send it back above $8650. Still, it\u2019s certainly been a week to forget for the cryptocurrency, with a hat-trick of bad news \u2013 a shift in regulations in South Korea, a Facebook ban on ads for the product, and an investigation by the US CFTC \u2013 causing it to shed around $3000 per Bitcoin. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a748180e4b08ad1ec3ee490\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:21:11.069Z\">3.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>With the dollar recovering in the expectation of an imminent US interest rate rise, the pound has lost some of its recent gains.</p> <p>Sterling is down more than 1% on the day against the dollar to $1.4119, its biggest daily fall since November last year.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a748009e4b0839ae39a8564\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:17:46.392Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The university of Michigan\u2019 survey may have come in better than expected but it did show the consumer sentiment index at its lowest level since September.

The January Sentiment figure was just 0.2 Index-points below December\u2019s, and just 1.1 points below the 2017 average of 96.8--which was the highest yearly average since 2000. Stock price increases and the passage of tax reforms were mentioned by all-time record numbers of consumers. To be sure, there were small offsetting declines among lower income households and residents of the Northeast.</p> <p> Consumers continued to expect growth in jobs and incomes, but anticipated a slightly higher inflation rate. Importantly, the motivating force behind purchase decisions has shifted from discounts on prices and interest rates to increased confidence in future job security and growth in wages as well as financial assets. This renewed sense of confidence was responsible for the recent declines in savings rates. </p> <p>he tax cuts will increase discretionary spending once higher energy bills due to the unusually cold weather are paid. Monetary policy will need to tighten in the year ahead, but given consumers\u2019 decade long experience with record low interest rates, only modest increases in interest rates will be sufficient to curb any excesses. Overall, the data signal an expected gain of 2.8% in real personal consumption expenditures during 2018. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adb63510534613fbe208a5edfd1042dcd253cc8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adb63510534613fbe208a5edfd1042dcd253cc8d/0_0_1086_697/1000.jpg\" alt=\"umichconf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"642\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:17:57.886Z\">at 3.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a747ebee4b0460af94bf3d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:08:18.051Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The upbeat consumer confidence figures have sent Wall Street even lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 300 points or more than 1.1%.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:09:09.172Z\">at 3.09pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5a747dfce4b0839ae39a8542\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T15:07:02.916Z\">3.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US consumer confidence remains strong</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>More positive news for the US economy, adding to the belief that the Federal Reserve will be ready to raise interest rates next month.</p> <p>The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index came in at 95.7 in January, up from an initial reading of 94.4 and better than the expected figure of 95.

Economist James Knightley says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The US jobs report is very strong with payrolls rising 200,000 versus expectations of 180,000. There were some chunky upward revisions too, but the big story is wage growth which looks much, much better. Wages are now growing 2.9% year on year (the fastest rate of growth since 2009) with last month\u2019s figure revised up to 2.7% from 2.5%. Unemployment stays at 4.1%, but given the strength of this report it is hard to argue against a March Fed rate hike now.</p> <p>Wage growth has been the missing link in the strong economic growth, tight jobs market story. We have been hoping for some time to see a turnaround and it does finally look as though something is happening. It backs up evidence from yesterday\u2019s National Federation of Independent Businesses small business survey, which showed the net proportion of businesses raising worker compensation is at its highest since 2000. The report also showed you have to go all the way back to 1989 to find when the index indicating the net proportion of businesses that plan to raise worker pay was higher. </p> <p>Given companies such as WalMart have credited Trump\u2019s tax cuts as a way for them to afford higher worker pay we suspect we will see the wage numbers pick-up further. Rising wages and robust economic growth is also supportive for our 3% headline CPI call for this summer.</p> <p>Consequently, it will need a big shock to prevent the Fed from hiking in March, but it could happen in the form of a damaging government shutdown should politicians fail to resolve their differences \u2013 next deadline is February 8.

Selling pressure at the moment is intense as there has been nothing but bad news for bitcoin bulls of late.</p> <p>The key concern facing the bulls is the CFTC investigation into Tether and the Bitfinex exchange. Claims of full dollar convertibility are under scrutiny. Given there are about 2bn tether coins in existence, there should be a $2bn account somewhere but Tether has yet to prove it or have accounts audited.</p> <p>The idea that Tether is creating coins to buy bitcoin is straight out of satire. If bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then this is Ponzi squared; printing fake money to buy a different type of fake money in order to ramp up the price of the latter. If it weren\u2019t likely to cause real world losses for many investors it would be hilarious.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we see the jaws of the regulatory crunch closing on other fronts with moves to ban or greatly restrict trading on bitcoin gaining traction worldwide.

This would boost small businesses, and tackle the uncompetitive nature of the current outsourcing market. It would also protect the government from another Carillion crisis.</p> <p>Secondly, public contracts should not be awarded solely on the basis of \u201cvalue for money\u201d. Government contracts should be seen as an opportunity to create public value \u2013 where value is understood in holistic rather than narrow economistic terms. The government should account for the wider economic and social impact of its suppliers when determining which supplier should be awarded a particular contract. The Labour party\u2019s proposals to account for the quantity and quality of employment created by a supplier, the nature of its corporate governance, its environmental impact and its attitude towards tax suggests how this could be done.</p> <p>Thirdly, we need to call time on private financing. If the government wants to build a major infrastructure project it should do so through historically cheap public borrowing, on the public balance sheet, justifying the investment based on the economic, social, or environmental impact. Good public investment done well more than pays for itself in the long run. It should also expand its definition of investment to include investment in human as well as physical capital \u2013 spending on healthcare and education is just as much of an investment in the long-run economic capacity of this country as investments in roads and bridges.</p> </blockquote> <h2>More here: <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2018/02/problem-outsourcing-not-carillion-market-itself\">The problem with outsourcing is not Carillion but the market itself</a></h2> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5a743884e4b0839ae39a81dc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-02-02T10:12:34.890Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Carillion: 377 staff made redundant</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NEWSFLASH: Nearly 400 Carillion staff have just been made redundant, following its fall into liquidation last month.</strong></p> <p>The Official Receiver says it has managed to save more than 900 jobs, but 377 more have lost their jobs.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wall Street ended its worst week in two years on Friday with another sharp fall as markets in Europe also continued to tumble from the record-high levels reached less than a month ago. Investors headed for the exits amid growing fears over a bond market rout, triggered by early signs of inflation in the US as economic growth accelerates and wages appear to finally be rising after years of stagnation. US government bond yields, which rise as prices fall, hit the highest level since January 2014. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665 points to end the day down more than 2.5% and falling below 26,000, the record level it hit on 17 January. The sell-off came after the US labor department released a better than expected monthly jobs report, sparking fears of a sharper rise in interest rates. It was the first time since June 2016 that the Dow had fallen more than 500 points. Amid a widespread sell-off, the biggest fallers were Apple, Visa and oil firms Exxon and Chevron. In Europe, the FTSE 100 recorded its worst week since April last year when Theresa May called the snap election, dropping by 47 points to 7,443, while Germany\u2019s Dax fell 1.7%. The worst week for stocks under Donald Trump comes after one of the best years in history for shares in 2017 and just a week after the Dow hit a record high of 26,617. Some investors called the tail-end of the bull market a \u201cmelt-up\u201d \u2013 with US shares continuing to rise despite looking overpriced by traditional yardsticks, warning it was a last hurrah before a downward correction or crash. The latest sell-off comes amid stronger signals for the health of the global economy, which investors fear could fuel higher levels of inflation that would prompt central banks to raise interest rates. Investors said the drop could be a sign of the market returning to more typical periods of peaks and troughs after abnormally calm conditions last year. Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said: \u201cAs one of the best-ever Januarys for US equities ends in an upsurge of volatility, the beginning of February threatens to bring edgier conditions than investors have grown accustomed to.\u201d Figures from the US job market on Friday showed wages rising at the fastest annual rate since 2009, as the American economy created 200,000 new jobs last month \u2013 a better performance than had been expected by economists. Improving levels of pay could lead companies to hike their prices to compensate for higher wage bills \u2013 leading to an inflationary spiral. Analysts said the Federal Reserve now looks increasingly likely to raise interest rates next month when its panel of rate-setters meets for the first time under new chairman Jerome Powell. \u201cIt is hard to argue against a March Fed rate hike now,\u201d said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank. The stronger picture for economic growth in the US also triggered a rally for the dollar on international exchanges, with the pound falling by about 1% against the American currency. Despite the warning signals flashing for global stock markets, economists said the drop in equity prices may be a short-term trend if the world economy can continue to expand without generating too much inflation and if central banks do not hike interest rates more than anticipated. But a number of risks lurk in the background, including rising tensions over trade between the Trump White House and the rest of the world, or the re-emergence of geopolitical tensions or from rising indebtedness in China.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The collapse of Carillion has dragged the British construction industry to the brink of stagnation, as housebuilding activity fell last month for the first time since immediately after the EU referendum. The slowdown in home construction is likely to embarrass the chancellor, Philip Hammond, after he unveiled tax cuts for first-time buyers and extra support for housebuilding at the budget in November. The headline reading on the latest Markit/Cips UK construction PMI was 50.2, far below City economists\u2019 expectations for activity in the building sector and down from 52.2 in December. While that was just above the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion in economic output, it leaves the industry teetering on the edge. The fallout from Carillion\u2019s collapse has rattled the building industry in the past month, with its failure threatening to drag down tens of thousands of smaller sub-contractors that relied on it for work. The company had 450 contracts from the government, including for building hospitals in Liverpool and Birmingham. Max Jones of Lloyds, which is among high street banks offering emergency support to building firms, said: \u201cThe impact of Carillion\u2019s liquidation has rippled down the supply chain and shaken confidence across the industry.\u201d The rate of job creation in the construction industry eased to an 18-month low in line with the reduced growth of building activity, according to the PMI survey. New orders decreased for the first time in four months, while firms said they faced sharp price pressures from the rising cost of building materials such as bricks, copper and timber. Despite the gloom over the industry, which accounts for a relatively small proportion of the country\u2019s overall economy, there were some positive signals. Commercial building returned to growth for the first time in six months in January, while civil engineers also saw a modest increase in activity. However, the survey showed hesitance among construction clients to invest in new projects due to rising concerns over the UK economic outlook and uncertainty over Brexit. Duncan Brock at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, said: \u201cWith construction teetering on the edge of contraction, this surprise outcome will serve as a jolt to policymakers.\u201d",

The US added 200,000 new positions in January, higher than expected, but the real surprise was in wage growth. Hourly earnings rose 0.3% in January, enough to lift the annual rate up to 2.9%. \u201cThis may be the start of a welcome trend in wage gains, and marks the highest percentage increase in average hourly earnings since 2009,\u201d said the US secretary of labor, Alexander Acosta. A tightening labour market and unemployment at 4.1% (a 17-year low) appears finally to be making its way into people\u2019s pockets as employers are forced to raise wages in order to attract talent. But the big numbers hide an ominous trend. For many Americans, slow wage growth isn\u2019t just a hangover of the post-2008 \u201cgreat recession\u201d. For those without a college degree the sluggish rate of growth can be traced back to the 1970s, and the more recent slump deepened that inequality. The latest jobs figures show that wages for \u201cproduction non-supervisory\u201d positions \u2013 the bottom 83% of the jobs market \u2013 grew at 2.4%. Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, said that suggested gains for those in more senior positions were far greater than the 2.9% headline rate. \u201cThe top 17% seems to be pulling away and it looks to me that that distance is a little problematic,\u201d she said. Gould is currently analysing the wages data, but her 2016 study found average wages of workers with a college degree (at $31.87 an hour) were nearly twice that of those with a high school degree only ($17.14 an hour). Slow wage growth has been held back in part by the decline of unions in the US and also by the still large pool of people who have dropped out of the workforce. The labour force participation rate \u2013 which measures the percentage of the US population in jobs or actively looking for work \u2013 is bafflingly stuck at 62.7% despite seven years of strong jobs growth. It was 67.3% in 2000. With so many people still sitting it out on the sidelines, employers maintain the upper hand, and low-wage workers, in particular, continue to count the cost.",

      "bodyText": "A major coal power station in Yorkshire will close at the end of September after it failed to secure a government subsidy to provide backup power next winter. Losing out on a capacity market contract sounded the death knell for Eggborough, which supplies power to 2m homes and employs around 170 people, about 130 of whom are expected to be laid off. About 40 will be kept on for decommissioning and demolition. \u201cAlready on the ropes, Eggborough missing out on a capacity market contract was the final straw for this once-great power station,\u201d said Jonathan Marshall, energy analyst at the ECIU thinktank. The plant is run by Czech power firm EPH, which bought two of British Gas owner Centrica\u2019s large gas plants last year, and also owns an old power coal plant in Northumberland which it is converting to burn wood. The firm said Eggborough was no longer economically viable without the support from the scheme, the government\u2019s key insurance policy for keeping the lights on. Adam Booth, managing director at Eggborough Power Ltd, said: \u201cWith the age of the plant and the current government\u2019s policy that all UK coal-fired power generation must cease by 2025, Eggborough has been under threat of closure for the past few years.\u201d Prospect union, which has members at the plant, said it was deeply disappointed at the decision. Eggborough has been generating electricity for more than half a century. After it shuts, there will be just six coal plants left in the UK, as Northern Ireland\u2019s last coal plant is also due to close in May after it failed to win a contract in Ireland\u2019s new capacity market. The economics of coal have become increasingly untenable because of a government carbon tax and the relatively low price of gas, causing three plants to shut in 2015. The government, which has committed to phasing out coal by 2025 to cut carbon emissions, had predicted at least one coal power station would shut this year. The fossil fuel is rapidly dwindling as a source of electricity, providing a third of the UK\u2019s power in January as it did for January 2017. Eggborough\u2019s owners said they are still committed to their aspiration of building a gas plant on the site, which would be capable of powering 2m homes. But one green group said it would be crazy to swap one fossil fuel for another. \u201cCurtains for coal must not be a free pass to switch these plants to giant gas units,\u201d said Dominique Doyle at environmental law firm ClientEarth. The capacity market is crucial for the economics of coal and gas plants, and this week\u2019s auction saw \u00a334.7m of contracts awarded to operators for next winter. Three quarters of those winners were for gas plants, including big-six firm SSE\u2019s Peterhead, which is Scotland\u2019s last fossil fuel power station. It had been threatened with closure last year after missing out on a contract but will now continue operations.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A new toy has surfaced on the must-have list of leisure options for the world\u2019s billionaire class: private submersibles they can use to explore the oceans \u2013 or even use as James Bond-style means of escape if their superyacht should come under attack. The global super-rich last year bought about 30 submersibles \u2013 with price tags of up to \u00a330m \u2013 according to manufacturer Triton. These private submarines are known as submersibles because they are not independently powered, instead relying on batteries that have to be recharged by a support vessel. Louise Harrison, Triton\u2019s European sales director, said in recent months the BBC\u2019s Blue Planet series, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, had led to a \u201chuge spike\u201d in demand from wealthy buyers wanting to explore the deep and get up close to coral reefs, stingrays and whales. There is a growing number of super-rich, she said, who want more than to merely luxuriate in their good fortune. \u201cThe super-rich aren\u2019t happy to sit on the back of their yachts with a G&amp;T anymore. The modern ones and the young ones want to go to Antarctica and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to see what\u2019s beneath the surface as well as what\u2019s on top. They have seen Blue Planet, and they want to get down there and see it for themselves.\u201d Harrison told hundreds of delegates attending the Superyacht Investor conference in London this week that submersible manufacturers had their best year in 2017, as there has been \u201cdefinitive change in direction among owners to use their superyachts for new experiences\u201d. \u201cThe industry sold 25-30 submersibles last year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may not sound like a lot but they are priced at a minimum of \u00a31m and up to \u00a330m. It is a lot of money.\u201d The Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, Virgin\u2019s Sir Richard Branson, the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the US hedge fund manger Ray Dalio are among billionaires who have already splashed out on underwater vessels. Indeed, one may not be enough: Dalio said he was so \u201cwild about ocean exploration\u201d that he bought two submersibles, which were used in the filming of the second series of Blue Planet. \u201cThe underwater world is much larger than the above-water world, has more unidentified species than the above-water world, is essential to our wellbeing, is incredibly interesting and valuable, and is mostly unexplored,\u201d said Dalio, the world\u2019s 90th richest person with a $14.6bn (\u00a310.3bn) fortune. \u201cFor those reasons, and for the thrill of it, I am wild about ocean exploration. I explore the ocean personally while tagging along with great ocean scientists and explorers, and I financially support ocean exploration that goes on way beyond me \u2013 including sharing these thrills with the public through various media outlets and museum exhibits.\u201d Dalio\u2019s submersibles \u2013 named Nadir and Deep Rover \u2013 are based on his $50m expedition-focused superyacht, Alucia. The Nadir is a Triton 3300/3 model capable of diving to a depth of 1,000 metres with a pilot and two passengers on board and sells for about $3m depending on fixtures and fittings. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cBut do you want to go diving in a cheap submersible?\u201d Harrison said the growth in submersibles had been driven by a rapid improvement in acrylic technology, which means they can be fitted with large clear bubble domes, giving a 360-degree views of the ocean. \u201cWhen you\u2019re underwater the acrylic sort of disappears and you feel like you are actually in the ocean. It\u2019s a bit dreamlike when you\u2019re down there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe acrylic is the expensive bit, as the technology has only recently got so advanced that you can go that deep. It is very, very expensive stuff \u2013 you don\u2019t want to scratch it.\u201d Harrison said most customers say they are interested in buying submersibles for exploration, but some have also inquired about using them as \u201cpanic rooms or escape vessels\u201d. Triton\u2019s biggest competitor, Holland\u2019s U-Boat Worx, has designed an ultra-lightweight submersible model specifically for superyachts. Its Super Yacht Sub Three is piloted from the rear so the passengers can get the best view of the ocean from the front of the bubble dome. The company said: \u201cThis submarine is aimed at the yacht market ... [it] delivers both performance and luxury.\u201d Triton, which is based in Florida, has partnered with British luxury car group Aston Martin to work on a new $4m three-man submersible codenamed Project Neptune. The subs, which are expected to hit the market later this year, will dive to 1,650ft and have a top speed of 3.5 miles an hour. Marek Reichman, Aston Martin\u2019s chief creative officer, said the company had decided to expand into submersibles following interest expressed by its richest customers. \u201cThose superyacht people, what they want to experience is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer about just having a launch or having your tender. It\u2019s about having some other way of entertaining your guests.\u201d",

These private submarines are known as submersibles because they are not independently powered, instead relying on batteries that have to be recharged by a support vessel.</p> <p> Louise Harrison, Triton\u2019s European sales director, said in recent months the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/29/blue-planet-ii-chosen-by-tv-critics-as-best-show-of-2017\">BBC\u2019s Blue Planet series, narrated by Sir David Attenborough</a>, had led to a \u201chuge spike\u201d in demand from wealthy buyers wanting to explore the deep and get up close to coral reefs, stingrays and whales.</p> <p>There is a growing number of super-rich, she said, who want more than to merely luxuriate in their good fortune. \u201cThe super-rich aren\u2019t happy to sit on the back of their yachts with a G&amp;T anymore. The modern ones and the young ones want to go to Antarctica and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to see what\u2019s beneath the surface as well as what\u2019s on top. They have seen Blue Planet, and they want to get down there and see it for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Harrison told hundreds of delegates attending the Superyacht Investor conference in London this week that submersible manufacturers had their best year in 2017, as there has been \u201cdefinitive change in direction among owners to use their superyachts for new experiences\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cThe industry sold 25-30 submersibles last year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may not sound like a lot but they are priced at a minimum of \u00a31m and up to \u00a330m. It is a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>The Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, Virgin\u2019s Sir Richard Branson, the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the US hedge fund manger Ray Dalio are among billionaires who have already splashed out on underwater vessels. Indeed, one may not be enough: Dalio said he was so \u201cwild about ocean exploration\u201d that he bought two submersibles, which were used in the filming of the second series of Blue Planet. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=limOvw1sxEY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/limOvw1sxEY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cThe underwater world is much larger than the above-water world, has more unidentified species than the above-water world, is essential to our wellbeing, is incredibly interesting and valuable, and is mostly unexplored,\u201d said Dalio, the world\u2019s 90th richest person with a $14.6bn (\u00a310.3bn) fortune. </p> <p>\u201cFor those reasons, and for the thrill of it, I am wild about ocean exploration. I explore the ocean personally while tagging along with great ocean scientists and explorers, and I financially support ocean exploration that goes on way beyond me \u2013 including sharing these thrills with the public through various media outlets and museum exhibits.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Dalio\u2019s submersibles \u2013 named Nadir and Deep Rover \u2013 are based on <a href=\"https://aluciatheship.com/technology/submarines/\">his $50m expedition-focused superyacht, Alucia</a>. </p> <p>The Nadir is a Triton 3300/3 model capable of diving to a depth of 1,000 metres with a pilot and two passengers on board and sells for about $3m depending on fixtures and fittings. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cBut do you want to go diving in a cheap submersible?\u201d</p> <p>Harrison said the growth in submersibles had been driven by a rapid improvement in acrylic technology, which means they can be fitted with large clear bubble domes, giving a 360-degree views of the ocean. \u201cWhen you\u2019re underwater the acrylic sort of disappears and you feel like you are actually in the ocean. It\u2019s a bit dreamlike when you\u2019re down there,\u201d she said. \u201cThe acrylic is the expensive bit, as the technology has only recently got so advanced that you can go that deep. It is very, very expensive stuff \u2013 you don\u2019t want to scratch it.\u201d </p> <p>Harrison said most customers say they are interested in buying submersibles for exploration, but some have also inquired about using them as \u201cpanic rooms or escape vessels\u201d. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc97db00dbaa5f29b427025102876ce905138e18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc97db00dbaa5f29b427025102876ce905138e18/0_155_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The submersible \u2018Nadir\u2019 used by Blue Planet II team to film the Deep episode.

Its Super Yacht Sub Three is piloted from the rear so the passengers can get the best view of the ocean from the front of the bubble dome. The company said: \u201cThis submarine is aimed at the yacht market ...  [it] delivers both performance and luxury.\u201d</p> <p>Triton, which is based in Florida, has partnered with British luxury car group Aston Martin to work on a new $4m three-man submersible codenamed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.astonmartin.com/en/live/news/2017/09/28/project-neptune-triton-and-aston-martin\">Project Neptune</a>. The subs, which are expected to hit the market later this year, will dive to 1,650ft and have a top speed of 3.5 miles an hour. </p> <p>Marek Reichman, Aston Martin\u2019s chief creative officer, said the company had decided to expand into submersibles following interest expressed by its richest customers. \u201cThose superyacht people, what they want to experience is changing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer about just having a launch or having your tender.

The bidder would formally throw its cards on the tables, hurl a few choice insults at the target\u2019s management and generally enliven proceedings. Melrose\u2019s \u00a37bn offer for GKN is proving to be lower in energy. That is not just because takeover rules impose greater calm these days. It is also because Melrose\u2019s formal document on Thursday lacked a certain pizzazz. Everybody knows by now that Melrose\u2019s managers have been stunningly successful in enriching their shareholders - and themselves - in past deals. A pound invested at float in 2003 is now worth \u00a317.70. But the main doubt about the approach to GKN is whether the formula can be repeated on a bigger business with hard-nosed customers such as Airbus, Boeing and the big carmakers. On that score, Christopher Miller\u2019s letter offered more style than enlightenment. The Melrose chairman seemed more concerned with puncturing the perception that his outfit is a ugly asset-stripper that would happily dismember GKN before breakfast. Don\u2019t worry, we get it. Melrose is a UK-quoted company that invests in its operations and, if GKN\u2019s aerospace and automotive divisions are eventually separated, one or other could have its own listing on the London market. But what\u2019s the big plan to shift GKN through the gears? None of the ideas sound terribly complicated. Restructuring the head office may save a few quid. Clearing out of a few layers of management to create \u201ca speedy, flat and non-bureaucratic organisation\u201d is plainly sensible. So is a focus on profits rather than sales. So is investment that concentrates on returns. Melrose might respond that a dose of common sense is all that\u2019s required. But the approach does leave the door open for GKN to promise to perform a few of the same tricks, in which case its shareholders would enjoy 100% of the benefits rather than sharing them. GKN\u2019s new chief executive, Anne Stevens, still has to prove her credibility and produce a decent strategy, of course. If she can\u2019t, Melrose will romp home. As things stand the offer, which is mostly in Melrose\u2019s own paper, represents a premium of 28% to GKN\u2019s share price before the action started. That\u2019s decent, but it\u2019s not a knockout price for a business that is far from being a basket case. To deserve support, Melrose must offer to share more of the spoils. Unilever buoyant since killing Kraft bid On the generally reliable principle that managements only announce targets they think can be achieved, it is no surprise that Unilever is \u201cwell on track,\u201d as its chief executive, Paul Polman, put it, to meeting the goals it set after dispatching Kraft Heinz\u2019s approach a year ago. A 20% profit margin by 2020? It\u2019s the way to bet. Unilever is not yet motoring at full speed, and market conditions are far from perfect, but margins improved to 16.5% in 2017 from 14.8% in 2016. Profit before tax climbed 9% to \u20ac8.1bn (\u00a37.1bn), or by 13% ignoring currency movements. The next excitement concerns the announcement of the location of Unilever\u2019s single headquarters. That\u2019s a UK-versus-Netherlands affair with political undercurrents, and the UK does not start as favourite. Expect to hear much muttering about how the site of an HQ is less important for a multinational these days. Well, maybe. We should definitely give thanks that long-termist Unilever banished Kraft, an unlovely and brutal cost-cutter, over the course of a weekend. Shareholders should be grateful too. Unilever\u2019s shares are up 25% since the fun and Kraft\u2019s have fallen 11%, perhaps demonstrating that the bidder needed the deal more than it cared to admit. The only quibble is why it required an approach for Unilever to pull rabbits from its hat. As the fund manager Terry Smith put it the other day: \u201cWe think we should already have seen the rabbits or at least been told about their existence.\u201d Capita faces tricky questions Another day, another 13% off Capita\u2019s share price. That\u2019s 54% since Wednesday\u2019s profits warning and axed dividend. There is still no need for government ministers to panic, because Capita has arrangements in place to raise \u00a3700m from shareholders, underwritten by Citi and Goldman Sachs. That makes its financial distress different from Carillion\u2019s. The construction firm\u2019s numbers were far worse and it was scrambling for bank loans, as opposed to permanent equity. But Capita\u2019s chief executive, Jonathan Lewis, still needs to get his skates on. Investors and City analysts have recovered from their shock and are asking tricky questions. How severe is Capita\u2019s underinvestment in IT and software? How much needs to be spent to fix the problem? Is \u00a3700m enough to do the job, repair the balance sheet and boost payments to the pension fund? How much does the disposal programme need to raise?

    "webTitle": "At least 377 Carillion staff to be made redundant", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "At least 377 former Carillion staff will be made redundant, the Insolvency Service has said, as directors in charge of the company when it collapsed were criticised for a policy of late payment that has left suppliers facing \u201cpotential ruin\u201d. The official receiver, the part of the Insolvency Service charged with handling Carillion\u2019s liquidation, said it had found new employment for 919 staff, who will transfer to other companies. The receiver is still sorting through Carillion\u2019s contracts to determine the future of more than 18,000 employees, prompting a warning from Unite, the UK\u2019s largest trade union, that staff were \u201cin limbo\u201d. At least 377 people will lose their jobs, the official receiver said, most of them back-office employees such as sales staff who tried to win new contracts for the company. A Unite spokesperson said: \u201cThese latest redundancy announcements have increased the feeling of chaos and confusion which has stalked Carillion since its collapse last month. Thousands of workers remain in limbo and don\u2019t know if they will be able to continue to feed their families.\u201d A spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said staff could claim for statutory redundancy payments and take advice from the Jobcentre Plus\u2019s rapid response service. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThis is grim news for these workers. And many more workers at Carillion, its contractors and supply chain are seriously worried.\u201d Carillion entered liquidation last month when, after a string of profit warnings triggered by unprofitable contracts, it buckled under the weight of a \u00a3900m debt pile. As well as uncertainty for former staff, small businesses in its supply chain that had yet to receive payment from Carillion have been left facing financial difficulty. In a letter to MPs on two parliamentary committees holding a joint inquiry into Carillion, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said the company was \u201cnotorious for being late payers\u201d, often forcing firms to wait up to 126 days for bills to be settled. The FSB chairman, Mike Cherry, said the company\u2019s payment habits were an \u201cabuse of Carillion\u2019s dominant position, and have contributed to the perilous situation whereby many of Carillion\u2019s small business suppliers now face the prospect of next to no payment for four months\u2019 work\u201d. Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business select committee, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Carillion were notorious late payers, ruthlessly exploiting their position to bully their contractors in a desperate bid to prop up their precarious business model.\u201d She said it was a \u201ccruel joke\u201d that Carillion had been signed up to the prompt payments code, a government-backed scheme to ensure suppliers were not left waiting for payment. Frank Field, the work and pensions committee chair, said: \u201c[Carillion chairman] Philip Green was part of the government\u2019s advisory panel looking at how to deal with bad business practice. He obviously brought a lot of technical knowledge to the brief. But has the government benefited? \u201cFor clearly Carillion didn\u2019t, leaving huge numbers of smaller suppliers not only facing late payments, but no payments at all.\u201d The government was due to announce on Friday that the British Business Bank will provide an extra \u00a3100m of lending to small businesses as part of a package of measures to support companies and staff affected by Carillion\u2019s collapse. This is in addition to more than \u00a3200m provided by Lloyds, HSBC and RBS. The collapse of Carillion has dragged the British construction industry to the brink of stagnation, according to a sector survey published on Thursday, as housebuilding activity fell last month for the first time since immediately after the EU referendum.

The transport minister, Jesse Norman, launched a consultation on Friday to outline the crackdown, although any law will not be retrospective so could not be used to target Volkswagen. \u201cWe continue to take the unacceptable actions of Volkswagen extremely seriously, and we are framing new measures to crack down on emissions cheats in future,\u201d Norman said. \u201cThose who cheat should be held to proper account in this country, legally and financially, for their actions.\u201d Downing Street said new powers would go above and beyond European requirements and the government would be able to prosecute any manufacturer who cheated on the required tests for vehicles. However, it is thought sentences will only include unlimited fines rather than prison sentences. Crucially, the rules will extend to imported cars which Downing Street said was the key reason the UK was previously unable to impose fines on Volkswagen, which was ordered to pay $2.8bn in criminal penalties in the United States for cheating on emissions tests, revealed in 2015. \u201cAt the moment, we are limited to taking action against a manufacturer who obtained or sought to obtain type approval in the UK. We intend to expand this so that we are able to take action against a manufacturer, importer or dealer who places a vehicle using a defeat device on the UK market,\u201d a UK government official said.

At the time of the scandal, the then-transport minister Patrick McLoughlin said the company \u201chad behaved in an appalling way\u201d and deserved to be severely punished. \u201cThese devices were made illegal in 1998 and it\u2019s fairly unbelievable that a company the size and reputation of Volkswagen has been doing something like this and finding ways round this legislation,\u201d he told a select committee hearing. \u201cI think they are going to suffer substantial damage as a result and they deserve to, quite frankly.\u201d About 1.2m of the Volkswagen cars were sold in Britain and the Department for Transport set up a \u00a31.1m vehicle emissions testing programme, paid for by Volkswagen, to test a range of the most popular diesel vehicles in the UK in the wake of the scandal, but found no other manufacturer tested was using a similar strategy. The beleaguered company came under fresh fire last month after it was revealed it helped to fund experiments in which monkeys and humans breathed in car fumes for hours at a time. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said there was an urgent need for the company to reveal the true extent of the experiments, commissioned by the European Research Group of Environment and Health in the Transport Sector (EUGT), which is funded by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW.",
