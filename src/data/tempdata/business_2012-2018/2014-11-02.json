      "bodyText": "An insider from the world of business offered his solution last week to the question of how to restore trust in financial markets and big corporations: people power. Justin King, the former chief executive of Sainsbury\u2019s, said: \u201cThere are many businesses that detach themselves from normal rules for periods of time but eventually the consumer catches up and they are forced to change.\u201d Really? Could public revulsion have been more effective than government or regulatory action in preventing the latest scandals to cloud Britain\u2019s corporate reputation? Last week Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, two of Britain\u2019s biggest banks, set aside a total of \u00a3900m for settlements related to rigging of the foreign exchange market, and the Serious Fraud Office launched a criminal investigation into a misstatement of profit guidance at Tesco. With regard to banks, another intervention last week underlined how public anger over the behaviour of the financial services sector \u2013 from taxpayer bailouts to continued payment of bonuses \u2013 has failed to filter through to the glass and steel towers of Canary Wharf and the Square Mile. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Nemat Shafik, said that the City had deep-rooted problems that could no longer be blamed on a \u201cfew bad apples\u201d. Underlining the consequences to consumers of criminal behaviour in esoteric areas such as currency markets, she said: \u201cThe integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain. Markets here set the interest rates for people\u2019s mortgages, the exchange rates for our exports and holidays, and the commodity prices for the goods we buy.\u201d It has taken the intervention of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), not the consumer, to reprimand banks over forex rigging. Shafik is clearly frustrated that years of exhortations against bank misbehaviour have yet to trigger genuine cultural change. Public opinion, backed to varying degrees by politicians and regulators, caught up years ago but banks, perhaps emboldened by a reluctance among many customers to even switch accounts, continue to misbehave. The problems with supplier payments at Tesco \u2013 to the extent that its first-half profit forecast was overstated by \u00a3263m \u2013 came despite many UK consumers catching up with Tesco\u2019s \u201cdetachment\u201d and deciding to shop elsewhere, including in the aisles of German discounters. Indeed, one theory is that payments were pulled forward in a bid to meet difficult profit targets in a cut-throat commercial environment. It is arguable that people power helped detach Tesco from the normal rules of business in this case. So where does this leave King\u2019s argument about the consumer as ultimate arbiter? In the case of rigging financial markets, the public is hopelessly underpowered compared with bodies such as the FCA, the Bank of England and the Houses of Parliament. Criminal sanction and legislation remain the best tools for instilling moral rigour into the markets. The same applies to underhand accounting practices: the shopper who rumbles Tesco\u2019s shoddy pricing strategy can\u2019t be expected to extend their scrutiny to the supermarket\u2019s internal bookkeeping. Regulators and elected representatives must be in the vanguard of protecting consumers. King made his comments at a conference about tax, where he said public anger against Starbucks had forced the coffee chain to pay more to the UK exchequer. But only tougher laws and regulatory vigilance can make these concessions \u2013 and behavioural change \u2013 permanent. In surprising echoes of Russell Brand, King added: \u201cBy far the most powerful vote is not the one we make every five years at the ballot box, but the one shoppers make day in day out.\u201d But a vote for the party that promises to truly reform the financial services industry, and make morality an imperative ahead of profit for businesses in general, offers more reliable long-term protection. It will take more than voting with our feet. Abe needs to keep his balance as he drives down the yen Timing is everything for central banks, and the Bank of Japan chose the perfect moment to announce the expansion of its quantitative easing programme. Coming less than 48 hours after the US Federal Reserve brought its money-creation scheme to a halt, the move had the element of surprise and ensured Tokyo got maximum bang for the buck. Shares soared and the yen fell sharply. The reason for the beefing-up of QE in Japan is plain. Growth has faltered since the increase in sales tax in the spring, intensifying downward pressure on inflation caused by falling global food and fuel prices. There has been much muttering about how Abenomics, the three-pronged growth strategy for the economy introduced by prime minister Shinzo Abe, is failing. Abe says he will decide by the end of the year whether to go ahead with a second rise in sales tax, due to be implemented in October 2015. The additional monetary boost provided by increasing the purchase of Japanese bonds from \u00a550tn (\u00a3279bn) a year to \u00a580tn a year is designed to offset the drag on demand caused by higher taxes. Even so, the second sales tax increase is a gamble: Abe\u2019s credibility will suffer if he pulls the tax hike, but Japan\u2019s recent history is littered with examples of the economy being derailed by over-aggressive and premature policy tightenings. Abe\u2019s delicate balancing act may therefore need even more aggressive QE during 2015. Tokyo wants to boost growth by driving down the value of the yen, thereby making its exports more competitive. The problem with this is that one country\u2019s currency depreciation is another country\u2019s appreciation. What Japan does has consequences for the rest of the world. A weaker yen means a stronger dollar and a stronger euro. That suggests US interest rates will stay on hold for longer and increases the pressure on the European Central Bank to launch its own QE programme. The danger is clear, though: Japan, Europe and the US compete with each other to drive down their currencies, mirroring the tit-for-tat trade wars of the 1930s. Two powerful gay executives, two very different stories Lord Browne was among the first to congratulate Tim Cook last week after the Apple chief executive publicly came out as gay. The former BP boss said it sent an \u201cimportant signal round the world\u201d and might encourage other executives to come out. Most poignantly, Browne said that Cook\u2019s coming out was \u201cdifferent to my own\u201d. One of Britain\u2019s most powerful and respected business executives saw the divide between his public and private life shattered in 2007 by a kiss-and-tell, then the fateful application for a court injunction that led to his resignation. Browne\u2019s admirable work on LGBT issues since has helped pave the way for announcements like Cook\u2019s, even though the Apple chief works in an industry that is much more tolerant than the oil business. For all the moving eloquence of Cook\u2019s statement, one wishes that Browne had been able to speak similar words seven years earlier.",
