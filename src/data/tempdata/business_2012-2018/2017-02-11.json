      "bodyText": "When Lloyds Banking Group last week finally accepted responsibility for compensating the small business customers who were victims of a \u00a3245m fraud involving HBOS Reading, it was again forced to face up to the nasty surprises that lurk inside the once fast- growing bank it took over during the 2008 crisis. As the judge sentenced former HBOS Reading manager Lynden Scourfield and five associates to more than 47 years of combined jail time, he described him as \u201cutterly corrupt\u201d and driven by \u201crapacious greed\u201d uncovered after an investigation by Thames Valley police. Anthony Stansfeld, police and crime commissioner of the local force, pointed out that the fraud \u201ceither displays complicity or incompetence, a lack of corporate governance, complacency, and an absence of proper safeguards\u201d. While this is the only HBOS operation where fraud has been prosecuted, the lurid stories the jury heard about sex parties and cash in brown envelopes embellished its image as a bank whose ambitions had got out control. A 2013 parliamentary report described HBOS as an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d; in 2012, the now defunct Financial Services Authority lambasted subsidiary Bank of Scotland\u2019s aggressive, high-risk growth strategy, and another report, published in 2015 by the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, said the bank\u2019s business model \u201cplaced inappropriate reliance on continuous growth without due regard to the risks involved\u201d. The culmination of the four-month trial in Southwark Crown Court of Scourfield\u2019s associates \u2013 he had pleaded guilty earlier \u2013 came as the turnaround story of Lloyds almost reached its own conclusion. The jury returned its decision just as the taxpayer stake in Lloyds dropped below 5% (down from the 43% it had been at the height of the crisis). If the Treasury keeps selling its shares in tranches at the same rate, Chancellor Philip Hammond should be able \u2013 probably in May \u2013 to finally extricate the taxpayer from the bank after eight years of ownership. Certainly the bank\u2019s chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, would rather be focusing on preparations for the financial results for 2016 in a fortnight and the prospect of taxpayers getting back the \u00a320.3bn that was used to buy shares in Lloyds TSB and HBOS, once they were combined to prevent the enlarged bank collapsing. That Hammond is on the brink of being able to make such a claim makes a stark contrast with his prospects of selling the government\u2019s 73% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, and comes after a tumultuous period for Lloyds, punctuated with reminders about the troubles inside HBOS. The Halifax Bank of Scotland combination existed for just seven short years after the former building society merged with the Edinburgh-based bank in 2001, embarking on a mission to create a new force in the UK financial sector. HBOS was a hotshot lender. It devoured deals even as others were pulling back, often in commercial property, and not just in the UK but in Ireland and Australia too, where among the more quirky investments that have been sold off is a 16-metre-high pineapple-shaped tourist attraction in Queensland. In the UK, Peter Cummings, who ran the Bank of Scotland corporate lending arm, had a list of clients that included Sir Philip Green during his ill-fated bid for Marks &amp; Spencer in 2004. The 2015 BoE/FCA regulatory report outlines the complexities of the lending operations: the HBOS-backed buyout of house builder McCarthy &amp; Stone included the property moguls the Reuben Brothers and Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, who had also been involved with buying 220 pubs and Travelodge. HBOS and Hunter also bought construction company Crest Nicholson. Once the corporate lending business started to unravel, the costs were startling. According to the 2015 report, HBOS took \u00a352bn in charges for bad debts and poor investments between 2008 and 2011 \u2013 more than RBS. When the HBOS deal was announced in the febrile atmosphere that gripped global stock markets in the days after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, it was known that the lender was in trouble but it initially looked as if the cards were stacked in the favour of the Lloyds management. A combination of two giants of the high street would ordinarily have been subject to an investigation by the competition authorities, but then Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank famously secured assurances from prime minister Gordon Brown at a City cocktail party that this would be averted. Even though the EU later forced Lloyds to spin off 600 branches \u2013 they use the TSB brand and are now owned by Sabadell of Spain \u2013 the combined business still dominates the UK banking industry. In a move that helps play down its prominence, Horta-Os\u00f3rio runs the operation through a number of brands \u2013 including Halifax and Bank of Scotland \u2013 on the high street. He has also closed branches while putting the Lloyds and HBOS operations together, and then pared back costs to bolster profits, including swingeing jobs cuts \u2013 some 57,000 since 2008. But cost-cutting is loved by the City and Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, points out that the profit the government made on selling a tranche of its Lloyds shares two years ago, when they were trading above the 73.6p average price paid for them, means Hammond can now sell off the remaining stake at prices below break-even. \u201cIf you turn the clock back two years, there was a period when the market thought that Lloyds did not have any more PPI [payment protection insurance compensation to make provision for] and that it [the bank] was going to grow. Both those assumptions were wrong,\u201d said Gordon. The bill to compensate customers for PPI misselling was put at \u00a33.2bn when Horta-Os\u00f3rio first tried to tackle this scandal in 2011, but it has since grown to \u00a317bn \u2013 and left the industry as a whole with a bill of twice that. Selling off the final chunk of shares at a loss may take some of the shine off the government\u2019s exit \u2013 although the 2016 results could put a rocket under them if they beat expectations. The celebrations may also be overshadowed by questions about the long-term price of bailing out the industry. George Osborne, Hammond\u2019s predecessor, may also be disappointed. He harboured ambitions of selling cut-price shares to the public. There will, however, be no such coda to the government\u2019s intervention in a bank that is still tackling its toxic legacy. A busy five years for the boss Six months after bring lured to run Lloyds from the UK arm of Santander, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio was all but written off by the City when he took time off to recover from fatigue. When the Portuguese banker\u2019s temporary leave was announced in November 2011, the share price plunged to below 30p and there were doubts he would return to the bank\u2019s headquarters on London\u2019s Gresham Street. However, when Horta-Os\u00f3rio did get back to work, he shed some light on what had stopped him sleeping for five consecutive days, telling the New York Times about his fears for Lloyds - which had \u00a3300bn of debt, half of which was on very short repayment schedules. The eurozone crisis was putting investors off banks. But Lloyds is now no longer reliant on the debt markets for funding, in part helped by cheap money from the Bank of England\u2019s liquidity schemes. Other problems have proved costly to solve: as well as the \u00a317bn bill for payment protection insurance misselling, the bank has also paid multimillion-pound fines to regulators, including \u00a328m for using a bonus scheme that put staff under so much pressure to meet targets that they sold products to themselves, and a \u00a3226m fine for rigging Libor. As the government prepares to sell off its last remaining shares, Horta-Os\u00f3rio will be hoping that his decision to rein in the bank\u2019s international ambitions (it now operates in six countries rather than 30), focus on the UK and build up a credit-card business does not deter investors in the post-Brexit world. Last year as he wrote to staff apologise for revelations about his private life and the damage they caused to the group\u2019s reputation, he pledged his commitment to the role. But the taxpayer\u2019s exit may spark talk of his now leaving - he has been linked with top jobs at HSBC and Italy\u2019s Unicredit or even a political career in his native Portugal. But breaking free of the British taxpayer means that a bonus - worth up to \u00a3850,000 -promised to him in 2015 is likely to be released next year. That is part of the \u00a334m he has already been paid, and the \u00a36.5m he is expected to receive for 2016. JT",

      "bodyText": "Until recently Jane Austen has been Bath\u2019s most bankable literary connection, with fans flocking to the elegant Georgian town to channel Pride and Prejudice. But these days a romance written by another bankable female author is boosting the town\u2019s coffers. EL James\u2019s bestselling Fifty Shades trilogy is being credited with a sexual awakening that has put sales at Bath-based online sex toy retailer Lovehoney onto another plane. Last year the website\u2019s sales jumped almost 30%, boosted by a range tied to the first Fifty Shades film that encouraged increasingly adventurous Britons to create their own mise en sc\u00e8ne with props ranging from silky wrist restraints to adjustable nipple clamps, inspired by the steamy antics of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. Analysts are predicting another sales bonanza for Lovehoney and rivals such as Ann Summers this year thanks to the sequel\u2019s arrival in cinemas in time for Valentine\u2019s Day. \u2018She\u2019s a very nice lady,\u201d says Lovehoney co-founder Richard Longhurst of a shrewd licensing deal struck with the author that drew customers around the world to the site for the first time. \u201cShe\u2019s got her head screwed on and is nice with it.\u201d Lovehoney is an unlikely success story. Co-founders Longhurst and Neal Slateford chipped in \u00a34,500 each to get the business off the ground in 2002, with orders initially despatched from Longhurst\u2019s bedroom. Superficially, the friends are not typical entrepreneurs. Slateford was once half of DNA \u2013 the dance music producers best known for their remix of Suzanne Vega\u2019s Tom\u2019s Diner in 1990 \u2013 while Longhurst was a tech journalist. They met in 1996 when Longhurst was editing an internet magazine, and he interviewed Slateford about (in his words) the \u201cnerdy website for computer musicians\u201d he was setting up. Slateford\u2019s startup cash came from a redundancy cheque from the publisher he was working for when the dotcom bubble burst. From the outset they sought to normalise a market that suffers from an association with dingy shops and blacked-out windows, and were keen to appeal to female shoppers. \u201cI think one of the reasons why Lovehoney has been successful is that sex-toy retailing, particularly in the US, grew out of the pornography industry,\u201d says Longhurst. \u201cWe came into the industry as internet people.\u201d That is clear from the poky office they share. The decor is more The IT Crowd than Peter Stringfellow, and the desk is littered with objects that could be industry awards or novelty sex aids. The effect is completed by a blow-up Donald Trump doll complete with Make America Great Again cap. Slateford sees clear blue water between itself and rivals such as Ann Summers, which has a bigger turnover \u2013 sales exceeded \u00a3100m in 2015 according to the most recent accounts filed at Companies House \u2013 but is less profitable. \u201cThe Ann Summers proposition is about being naughty, and that\u2019s not what we are about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are much more couple-focused, a bit more normal.\u201d With rival sites called names like Adult365, Slateford says the name Lovehoney \u201cpopped into his head\u201d when he was flicking through a compendium of sex movies and stumbled upon Mudhoney, the Russ Meyer film from which the US grunge rock band subsequently took their name. It may be in the business of sex, but Lovehoney is not a intrinsically sexy business. Housed in a squat building on the edge of an industrial estate on the outskirts of Bath, the mezzanine floor of the warehouse houses the slower moving lines, an arrangement that results in a box of pink strap-ons nestling beside a stack of policeman hats. However, this lucrative specialist retail market is expected to be worth \u00a324bn globally by 2020, with industry data pointing to more relaxed attitudes to buying products that were once considered taboo. Lovehoney reported a 68% increase in profits to \u00a35.1m on sales of \u00a358m in the year to 31 March 2016. That success was recognised with a Queen\u2019s Award for Enterprise last year. The bestselling product is the \u201cSilver Bullet\u201d \u2013 a \u00a312.99 vibrator with 10 settings \u2013 which has benefited from a successful push into the US and Australia. \u201cPrince Philip asked: \u2018What do you do?\u2019\u201d says Longhurst, of his encounter with the Duke of Edinburgh at the Buckingham Palace drinks reception. \u201cI said \u2018Sex toys, sir\u2019 and he tottered off, so it might not have registered.\u201d This year Lovehoney is chasing growth in the US and Australia, having recently opened warehouses in both countries. \u201cIf we do half as well in the US as we have done in the UK we should be able to double the size of the business,\u201d says Slateford. The retailer receives frequent approaches from potential investors but it is not looking for backers, having paid for warehouses in Brisbane and Atlanta out of its own cashflow. The men, who have known each other for 20 years, found themselves on opposite sides of the Brexit debate, Longhurst says. \u201cI was a Leaver and Neal was a Remainer so we cancelled each other out.\u201d For Longhurst, who is 47, the benefits of being part of the EU just didn\u2019t stack up: \u201cFor me there is no such thing as an EU to trade with: it\u2019s 27 other countries,\u201d he says. Not to mention that, in the 2000s, Lovehoney\u2019s vibrators fell foul of Brussels\u2019 Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, designed to increase the recycling of obsolete electrical equipment. Slateford, who is 53, thought leaving would be a \u201cload of hassle\u201d and feels \u201cquite European\u201d. He concedes that the fallout of the vote, which has seen the value of sterling drop sharply against the dollar, could force up the price of its vibrators, which are manufactured in the Far East. \u201cWe buy a lot in dollars but we\u2019ve got a natural hedge because we also sell a lot in dollars now,\u201d says Slateford. \u201cWe have to be competitive but I suspect that some prices will have to rise at some point.\u201d The owners\u2019 other halves also hold senior positions in the business. Slateford\u2019s partner, Bonny Hall, is head of product development. The whiteboard behind her is crowded with Post-it notes describing products still in development. New toys are tested by staff using codenames and, once they are close to launch, by a roster of 30 external testers. Hall, who previously worked in the wine trade, says project-management expertise is more prized than an adventurous sex life, as new products can involve up to eight months of to-ing and fro-ing with suppliers. \u201cFirst you get the shape right, then you have to get the engineering right,\u201d she explains. VALENTINE BONUS The annual dash to the shops on the eve of Valentine\u2019s Day has become big business, with analysts predicting Britons will spend the best part of \u00a3500m on their loved ones in the coming days. Average spending per person on Valentine\u2019s Day is expected to increase 12% to just shy of \u00a330 this year, according to advisory firm PwC, as shoppers splurge on chocolates, flowers and gifts. It is predicting a total spend of \u00a3458.7m, as 14 February increasingly rivals Easter for retail revenue. But while fans of the romantic day are spending more, PwC\u2019s survey of 2,000 adults found almost half were not even planning to buy a card.",

      "body": "<p>Until recently Jane Austen has been Bath\u2019s most bankable literary connection, with fans flocking to the elegant Georgian town to channel <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. But these days a romance written by another bankable female author is boosting the town\u2019s coffers. EL James\u2019s bestselling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/27/fifty-shades-of-grey-el-james-fortune\" title=\"\"><em>Fifty Shades </em>trilogy</a> is being credited with a sexual awakening that has put sales at Bath-based online sex toy retailer Lovehoney onto another plane.</p> <p>Last year the website\u2019s sales jumped almost 30%, boosted by a range tied to the first <em>Fifty Shades </em>film that encouraged increasingly adventurous Britons to create their own <em>mise en sc\u00e8ne </em>with props ranging from silky wrist restraints to adjustable nipple clamps, inspired by the steamy antics of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. Analysts are predicting another sales bonanza for Lovehoney and rivals such as Ann Summers this year thanks to the sequel\u2019s arrival in cinemas in time for Valentine\u2019s Day.</p> <p>\u2018She\u2019s a very nice lady,\u201d says Lovehoney co-founder Richard Longhurst of a shrewd licensing deal struck with the author that drew customers around the world to the site for the first time. \u201cShe\u2019s&#xa0;got her head screwed on and is nice with it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/12/sex-is-hilarious-inside-uk-biggest-sex-toy-emporium\" title=\"\">Lovehoney</a> is an unlikely success story. Co-founders Longhurst and Neal Slateford chipped in \u00a34,500 each to get the business off the ground in 2002, with orders initially despatched from Longhurst\u2019s bedroom.</p> <p>Superficially, the friends are not typical entrepreneurs. Slateford was once half of DNA \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/oct/18/suzanne-vega-how-we-made-toms-diner-dna\" title=\"\">the dance music producers best known for their remix of Suzanne Vega\u2019s Tom\u2019s Diner</a> in 1990 \u2013 while Longhurst was a tech journalist. They met in 1996 when Longhurst was editing an internet magazine, and he interviewed Slateford about (in his words) the \u201cnerdy website for computer musicians\u201d he was setting up. Slateford\u2019s startup cash came from a redundancy cheque from the publisher he was working for when the dotcom bubble burst.</p> <p>From the outset they sought to normalise a market that suffers from an association with dingy shops and blacked-out windows, and were keen to appeal to female shoppers.</p> <p>\u201cI think one of the reasons why Lovehoney has been successful is that sex-toy retailing, particularly in the US, grew out of the pornography industry,\u201d says Longhurst. \u201cWe came into the industry as internet people.\u201d</p> <p>That is clear from the poky office they share. The decor is more <em>The IT Crowd </em>than Peter Stringfellow, and the desk is littered with objects that could be industry awards or novelty sex aids. The effect is completed by a blow-up Donald Trump doll complete with Make America Great Again cap.</p> <p>Slateford sees clear blue water between itself and rivals such as Ann Summers, which has a bigger turnover \u2013 sales exceeded \u00a3100m in 2015 according to the most recent accounts filed at Companies House \u2013 but is less profitable. \u201cThe Ann Summers proposition is about being naughty, and that\u2019s not what we are about,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are much more couple-focused, a bit more normal.\u201d</p> <p>With rival sites called names like Adult365, Slateford says the name Lovehoney \u201cpopped into his head\u201d when he was flicking through a compendium of sex movies and stumbled upon <em>Mudhoney</em>, the Russ Meyer film from which the US grunge rock band subsequently took their name.</p> <p>It may be in the business of sex, but Lovehoney is not a intrinsically sexy business. Housed in a squat building on the edge of an industrial estate on the outskirts of Bath, the mezzanine floor of the warehouse houses the slower moving lines, an arrangement that results in a box of pink strap-ons nestling beside a stack of policeman hats. However, this lucrative specialist retail market is expected to be worth \u00a324bn globally by 2020, with industry data pointing to more relaxed attitudes to buying products that were once considered taboo.</p> <p>Lovehoney reported a 68% increase in profits to \u00a35.1m on sales of \u00a358m in the year to 31 March 2016.

      "bodyText": "Rolls-Royce will report one of the biggest losses in British corporate history this week as Brexit and a corruption scandal leave an indelible mark on the famous aerospace company. City analysts have forecast that Rolls could report a pre-tax loss of more than \u00a34bn \u2013 its worst ever \u2013 due to the sharp decline in the value of the pound and the \u00a3671m penalty that the company has agreed to pay to settle corruption allegations. Accounting rules mean Rolls will be forced to write down the value of its currency hedges to reflect sterling\u2019s slump. The pound has lost almost a fifth of its value against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU last June. Rolls hedges billions of pounds of cash to protect itself against currency fluctuations because deals in the aerospace industry are conducted in dollars. The financial results will also recognise the impact of the \u00a3671m penalty that Rolls agreed with authorities in the UK, US and Brazil to settle corruption charges. Although Rolls will make the payment over five years \u2013 with \u00a3293m expected to be paid in the first year \u2013 it is likely to recognise the full cost in the latest accounts as an impairment charge. The pre-tax loss will be the biggest in the history of Rolls, although it is a non-cash loss that reflects a change in the value of assets in its accounts rather than cash actually leaving the business. The biggest loss in British history is the \u00a324bn recorded by Royal Bank of Scotland for 2008. RBS reported another \u00a38.3bn loss for 2013, while Vodafone reported a \u00a322bn loss in 2006 and a \u00a313.5bn loss in 2002. Other milestones include a \u00a38.5bn loss for HBOS in 2008 after it was bought by Lloyds, \u00a36.5bn for Cable &amp; Wireless in 2003, Tesco\u2019s \u00a36.4bn in 2015, and \u00a34.5bn for BP last year. Warren East, Rolls\u2019s chief executive, will face questions about the corruption scandal when he presents the results, such as how it was allowed to happen, what has been done to ensure it does not happen again, and whether the company could lose contracts due to the damage to its reputation. He has already apologised and called the behaviour that was uncovered \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. However, an industry source said he was prepared to \u201caddress the issue front and centre and not shy away from it\u201d. Rolls agreed to the settlement over allegations that it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013 to win contracts. Sir Brian Leveson, who approved the so-called deferred prosecution in court, said the SFO\u2019s investigation into Rolls had revealed \u201cthe most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption\u201d and that some of the charges \u201cimplicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company\u201d. However, the judge praised the co-operation of the company\u2019s existing management, which allowed Rolls to settle with the SFO rather than face a damaging criminal trial. Despite the penalty and the record loss, East is likely to be in a positive mood when he presents the results. This is because the underlying performance of Rolls is gradually improving. The company has already told shareholders that it enjoyed a \u201cgood finish\u201d to the year, with underlying profit \u2013 which excludes the impact of sterling\u2019s decline and the SFO penalty \u2013 ahead of expectations. The consensus in the City is that underlying profits in 2016 were \u00a3687m, down from \u00a31.4bn in 2015. However, they are predicting a rise back to \u00a3861m this year. East has been trying to overhaul the engine-maker since replacing John Rishton as chief executive in 2015. He inherited a company that was struggling after a long run of success. Revenues were falling for the first time in a decade and underlying profits were down, prompting East to cut the dividend payout for shareholders for the first time in 24 years in 2016. Rolls, which makes engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbos among others, has been affected by lower-than expected demand for the wide-bodied airliners to which it supplies engines. But it has also been hurt by cuts to defence spending and the decline in the oil price, which has lowered demand from the offshore oil and gas industry for its marine products. A year ago, in a sign of the pressure on the company, Rolls was forced to appoint the chief operating officer of ValueAct to its board after the US activist investor built up a stake and called for change. Since then however, Bradley Singer, ValueAct\u2019s representative, has stayed quiet, publicly at least. Meanwhile, East has focused on making Rolls more efficient and accelerating the pace at which it builds engines. He has cut hundreds of middle and senior managers and by the end of 2017 wants to have cut \u00a3200m of annual costs. The Rolls boss has effectively backed the company\u2019s technology \u2013 and its pipeline of future development \u2013 but wants it to be a better manufacturer. Howard Wheeldon, a veteran defence and aerospace analysts, said that East had \u201ctaken the bulls by the horns\u201d. He said: \u201cRolls was paying the price for making a few mistakes in the past. They did not focus on efficiency. They are now, but they didn\u2019t. They allowed the company to become middle-heavy, and top-heavy actually.\u201d The settlement with the SFO ends a four-year probe \u2013 although individuals linked to allegations are still being investigated \u2013 and Wheeldon said Rolls could now focus on its future. \u201cWhat happened was a negative, but the positive is that we now have a settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can now move on with more clarity than they have in the last four years. They are on course with the plan they set out, but there is still a long, long way to go.\u201d",

However, an industry source said he was prepared to \u201caddress the issue front and centre and not shy away from it\u201d.</p> <p>Rolls agreed to the settlement over allegations that it bribed middlemen around the world between 1989 and 2013 to win contracts.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/20/rolls-royce-bribery-scandal-whats-the-best-price-for-a-silver-sprint-ii\" title=\"\">Sir Brian Leveson, who approved the so-called deferred prosecution in court</a>, said the SFO\u2019s investigation into Rolls had revealed \u201cthe most serious breaches of the criminal law in the areas of bribery and corruption\u201d and that some of the charges \u201cimplicated senior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company\u201d.</p> <p>However, the judge praised the co-operation of the company\u2019s existing management, which allowed Rolls to settle with the SFO rather than face a damaging criminal trial.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9226754ec8bc56d329c949783b654469c0ab22a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9226754ec8bc56d329c949783b654469c0ab22a4/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rolls-Royce\u2019s chief executive, Warren East.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rolls-Royce\u2019s chief executive, Warren East.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the penalty and the record loss, East is likely to be in a positive mood when he presents the results. This is because the underlying performance of Rolls is gradually improving.</p> <p>The company has already told shareholders that it enjoyed a \u201cgood finish\u201d to the year, with underlying profit \u2013 which excludes the impact of sterling\u2019s decline and the SFO penalty \u2013 ahead of expectations. The consensus in the City is that underlying profits in 2016 were \u00a3687m, down from \u00a31.4bn in 2015. However, they are predicting a rise back to \u00a3861m this year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/22/rolls-royces-incoming-chief-executive-admits-playing-the-welsh-card\" title=\"\">East has been trying to overhaul the engine-maker since replacing John Rishton as chief executive in 2015</a>. He inherited a company that was struggling after a long run of success. Revenues were falling for the first time in a decade and underlying profits were down, prompting East to cut the dividend payout for shareholders for the first time in 24 years in 2016.</p> <p>Rolls, which makes engines for Boeing\u2019s 787 Dreamliners and Airbus\u2019s A380 superjumbos among others, has been affected by lower-than expected demand for the wide-bodied airliners to which it supplies engines. But it has also been hurt by cuts to defence spending and the decline in the oil price, which has lowered demand from the offshore oil and gas industry for its marine products.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/02/no-breakup-rolls-royce-activist-investor-board-chairman\" title=\"\">A year ago, in a sign of the pressure on the company, Rolls was forced to appoint the chief operating officer of ValueAct to its board</a> after the US activist investor built up a stake and called for change. Since then however, Bradley Singer, ValueAct\u2019s representative, has stayed quiet, publicly at least.</p> <p>Meanwhile, East has focused on making Rolls more efficient and accelerating the pace at which it builds engines. He has cut hundreds of middle and senior managers and by the end of 2017 wants to have cut \u00a3200m of annual costs. The Rolls boss has effectively backed the company\u2019s technology \u2013 and its pipeline of future development \u2013 but wants it to be a better manufacturer.</p> <p>Howard Wheeldon, a veteran defence and aerospace analysts, said that East had \u201ctaken the bulls by the horns\u201d. He said: \u201cRolls was paying the price for making a few mistakes in the past. They did not focus on efficiency. They are now, but they didn\u2019t. They allowed the company to become middle-heavy, and top-heavy actually.\u201d</p> <p>The settlement with the SFO ends a four-year probe \u2013 although individuals linked to allegations are still being investigated \u2013 and Wheeldon said Rolls could now focus on its future.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened was a negative, but the positive is that we now have a settlement,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can now move on with more clarity than they have in the last four years. They are on course with the plan they set out, but there is still a long, long way to go.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The price of a fish supper could rise in the coming weeks as a strike by Icelandic fishermen threatens the UK\u2019s supply of fresh cod and haddock. The dispute, which has been fuelled by currency swings following the Brexit vote, has now started to affect British fish industry jobs, with business owners warning consumers that price hikes could be on the horizon. The news threatens a further hit to consumers\u2019 pockets as poor weather in Spain has caused a spike in lettuce, broccoli and aubergine prices. \u201cSince January we have had virtually no Icelandic fish,\u201d said Martyn Boyers, chief executive of the group that operates Grimsby fish market, the UK\u2019s biggest importer of fresh Icelandic fish. \u201cWe are currently down 75% on Icelandic fish in weight terms over the last five weeks. It\u2019s putting pressure on jobs in the supply chain and availability in shops.\u201d The supply crisis has forced job cuts at the Grimsby market, with roughly one-fifth of staff let go \u2013 from 32 down to 26. \u201cIf this strike continues it will be a problem not just for us but for all people who receive Icelandic fish,\u201d added Boyers. \u201cEveryone in the supply chain will be affected and, if they do get fish, they will have to pay more for it. Cod and haddock are a staple part of the British diet.\u201d At Grimsby, the price of whole cod is \u00a32.80\u2013\u00a33 per kilogram with haddock at \u00a32.20-\u00a33.30 per kg. Kolbjorn Giskeodegard, a seafood analyst at broker Nordea, said the Icelandic strike\u2019s fallout had raised the price of Norwegian cod, which was \u201cextraordinarily high\u201d in the wholesale market last month: \u201cThe price was up 40% to 50% on thin volumes,\u201d he said, explaining that the shortage had been created not only by the Icelandic strike but a delay to the start of the Norwegian fishing season. The Icelandic fisherman grounded their vessels over pay and conditions in December last year. A key area of tension is the chunk of the fishermen\u2019s pay packet linked to their catch. The Brexit blow to the pound has been bad news for the trawlermen, who have suffered a sharp fall in income due to the swing in the exchange rate as the Icelandic kronor strengthened against the pound. \u201cThe kronor has strengthened a lot [against the pound] over the last six to 10 months, said Haukur Thor Hauksson, deputy managing director of Fisheries Iceland. \u201cSo it follows that the income derived in kronor terms for both the ships and sailors has fallen. If you look back 10 months ago the pound was worth 200 ISK; today it is about 140. That\u2019s a drop of 30% the sailors are seeing in the price going to the British market.\u201d Hauksson said parties from both sides were having constructive meetings to try to resolve the issue. \u201cI can\u2019t promise anything regarding the timeline but we are having good talks.\u201d The pressure on the fish price comes as supermarkets struggle to supply fresh vegetables. Last week, retailers started rationing iceberg lettuces while others banned bulk purchases of aubergines, broccoli, loose courgettes and cabbage. Even olive oil has been affected, with weather conditions in Italy and Spain causing double-digit rises in wholesale prices. The shortages have started to affect the bottom line, with retailers selling 9% less iceberg lettuce \u2013 the UK\u2019s most popular leafy salad \u2013 in the three months to the end of January. Rocket and spinach sales were also down 42% and 12% respectively, according to industry analysts Kantar Worldpanel. To get their five a day shoppers have turned to cos lettuce, romaine and little gem, according to Kantar. Sales of kale soared 37% and cabbage lifted 4.2% as people turned to cheaper and more abundant vegetables. Sales of frozen vegetables such as peas, sweetcorn and spinach also rose 4% \u2013 almost \u00a312m worth.",
