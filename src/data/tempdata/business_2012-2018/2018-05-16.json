      "bodyText": "The outsourcing giant Capita has put patients at risk of serious harm after taking over NHS England\u2019s administration service, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has found. Failures resulted in 87 women being notified incorrectly that they were no longer part of the cervical screening programme and may have compromised patient safety, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). A report released on Thursday said patients may also have been harmed because of a failure to update the official list of 37,000 qualified GPs, dentists and opticians. Capita\u2019s performance and NHS England\u2019s decision to outsource administration services have resulted in continuing problems for primary care practitioners, said the NAO. It follows last month\u2019s announcement that the debt-laden firm has been forced into a \u00a3701m cash call following concerns over its finances. Fears over the outsourcing sector have intensified after a report by MPs on Wednesday accused Carillion\u2019s directors of putting their financial rewards ahead of all other concerns. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said Thursday\u2019s report showed that parliament is right to be concerned over the health of the sector. \u201cTrying to slash costs by more than a third at the same time as implementing a raft of modernisation measures was over-ambitious, disruptive for thousands of doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists and potentially put patients at risk of serious harm,\u201d she said. In August 2015, NHS England entered into a seven-year, \u00a3330m contract with Capita to deliver primary care support services covering payments to GP practices, opticians and pharmacies, staff pensions and changes to the lists of qualified practitioners. NHS England spent \u00a390m on these services in 2015 and aimed to reduce its costs by 35% from the first year of the contract. Capita proposed an overall reduction in staff numbers and expected to make a loss of \u00a364m in the first two years of the contract, which it planned to recoup in later years. Within months, poorly implemented changes in a new courier and labelling arrangement meant that providers struggled with the new systems. Capita could not cope with the resulting \u201csignificant increase\u201d in complaints, the report said. Auditors said Capita closed 35 out of 38 support offices across the country, cutting staff from 1,300 to 650, but this meant that there was a loss in local knowledge. NHS England was forced to intervene in September 2016, serving default notices on Capita and increasing the numbers of staff, the report said. The report said that patients could potentially have been put at risk due to problems with the \u201cperformers list\u201d of GPs, dentists and opticians practising in the NHS, including whether they are suitably qualified and have passed other relevant checks. Problems with the list also led to around 1,000 GPs, dentists and opticians being unable to work, 200 of whom have sought money for lost earnings, the report said. Other service failures included a backlog of 500,000 patient registration letters, medical supplies not being delivered, and delays or loss of patients\u2019 medical records. The report follows a series of outsourcing blunders involving Capita, which employs 70,000 people worldwide. In 2014, Capita racked up a backlog of assessments for personal independence payments, prompting the government to bring in civil servants. Earlier this month, staff from Tascor, which is part of the outsourcing giant, were criticised for using excessive restraint on low-risk asylum seekers on a removal flight. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said that both NHS England and Capita misjudged the scale and nature of the risk in outsourcing services. \u201cWhile NHS England has achieved financial savings and some services have now improved, value for money is about more than just cost reduction,\u201d he said. Dr Richard Vautrey, chair of the BMA\u2019s GP committee, said his members have called for elements of this service to be taken back in-house, and this report is now recommending the same. \u201cWith this as an option, we are now asking NHS England how it plans to resolve the shambles that is Capita\u2019s running of Primary Care Support England,\u201d he said. An NHS England spokesman said: \u201cWhile not without its difficulties, by making this change over the past two years the NHS has successfully saved taxpayers \u00a360m, as the NAO themselves confirm.\u201d A Capita spokesperson said the complexity of the support services being let by NHS England was not fully understood when the contract was signed. \u201cIt has been acknowledged that performance has improved and Capita will continue to work with all parties to address the remaining service issues,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have accepted accountability for not meeting our high standards of service previously.\u201d",

Two hours before closing time, the national supermarket chain will remove items with a use by or best before date for that day, so they can be donated to thousands of charities and small community groups in time for them to be frozen or turned into meals. After a successful trial at 50 branches, the scheme will be rolled out across the Co-op\u2019s 2,500 outlets, potentially creating almost 8m meals every year. Though food redistribution charities routinely receive large quantities of bread and other baked goods, the Co-op\u2019s scheme aims to guarantee donations of fresh food including meat, salads, fruit and vegetables, as well as ready meals and pizza. The Co-op Food Share aims to let groups make use of as much food as possible and allows them to collect from multiple stores regularly at flexible times in the 1,500 towns, villages and cities where the retailer has outlets. Beneficiaries could include homeless shelters, breakfast clubs for children and lunch clubs for the elderly.

      "bodyText": "A number of European markets managed to edge higher by the close, but a notable exception was Italy. The FTSE MIB fell sharply after reports the planned coalition government wanted the ECB to write off \u20ac250bn worth of debt, a move which in the unlikely event it happened, would send ructions through the eurozone. Elsewhere Wall Street benefited from a positive update from retailer Macy\u2019s, despite concerns about the renewed war of words between the US and North Korea. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 closed up 11.22 points or 0.15% at 7734.20 Germany\u2019s Dax edged up 0.2% to 12,996.33 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.26% at 5567.54 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 2.32% to 23,734.22 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.95% at 10,111.0 In Greece, the Athens market lost 1.43% to 787.90 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 60 points or 0.25%. Brent crude has managed to shake off its losses and is now up 0.05% at $78.47 a barrel. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. More on Carillion from Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the business committee: Back with Ben Broadbent and his \u201cpoor choice of language\u201d earlier, and here is a Guardian Pass notes for him to enjoy: Italy could cast a dark cloud over markets, says Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG: Italy should give investors pause for breath, although at present it is not quite having any real impact, since the likely coalition government seems set on upending the existing eurozone order. How far they plan to go remains a question that is yet to be solved, but it brings back uncomfortable memories of the eurozone crises of years past. Then, it was always said that the single currency union could survive the departure of Greece or Portugal, but that Italy would be the proverbial straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Italian assets are diverging from their eurozone brethren today, but if things get worse and these plans move closer to reality then we can expect the contagion to spread. Oil prices have recovered from their worst levels of the day after a bigger than expected fall in US crude stocks. They dropped by 1.4m barrels last week compared to a forecast of a 0.8m barrel dip. Petrol demand over the past four weeks was up 0.7% compared to a year ago. Oil prices had fallen back before the news, with some profit-taking after their recent rises following Donald Trump pulling the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran, which potentially curtails supplies from that country. But the bigger than expected demand for crude last week has seen Brent, which hit a low of $77.61 a barrel today, recover to be virtually flat at $78.42. More on Italy, and it seems there may not be a move to ask the ECB to cancel \u20ac250bn in Italian bonds: But, the Economist Intelligence Unit says: US markets have managed to open marginally higher as a rise in retail shares (including Macy\u2019s after a forecast beating update) was offset by falls in energy shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 16 points or 0.07% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened around the same amount higher. Earlier came news that US industrial output rose by 0.7% in April, while the March figure was revised upwards. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, said: Yesterday\u2019s retail sales figures showed a strong consumer sector and today\u2019s IP numbers further boost hopes of a strong bounce in 2Q economic activity. US industrial production rose 0.7%MoM in April, a touch above the 0.6% market prediction while growth in March was revised up from 0.5%MoM to 0.7%. There was good news in all the components with manufacturing seeing output rise 0.5% while utilities rose 1.9% and mining was up 1.1% The growth in mining reflects the rapid rise in oil and gas rig counts in response to higher prices. With oil not far from $80/bbl and US production efficiency continuing to improve this component will continue making positive contributions to overall US economic activity. Meanwhile manufacturing looks in great shape with the ISM and durable goods reports suggesting order books are very healthy \u2013 note output would have been up 0.6% were it not for auto weakness. Utilities is a bit of a surprise given output had already been really strong because of a particularly wintery start to the year, driving heating demand. We suspect this component will weaken in coming months. Overall the report suggests the industrial sector is buoyant shape. Nonetheless, if it hadn\u2019t been for the oil and gas revolution the story wouldn\u2019t be quite as rosy. Manufacturing output is still more than 5 percent down on the peak of November 2007, which means President Trump\u2019s is unlikely to reverse course on his claims of unfair foreign competition anytime soon. The UK Treasury is pumping an extra \u00a34m into the Office for National Statistics - which has been under fire in recent years for the quality of its data - to \u201ccapture what is happening in the modern economy.\u201d It brings investment in the ONS to \u00a316m so far, and will allow it to improve its measurement of inflation, the labour market and the service sector, as well as setting up new PhDs and apprenticeships. After a series of errors and criticisms of the standard of statistics, the government asked Sir Charles Bean to review the quality of the UK\u2019s economic data. The new funding is part of the response to Bean\u2019s review, although errors continue to be made including a miscalculation towards the end of last year of the growth in unit labour costs. Meanwhile the continuing political uncertainty in Italy has sent the euro lower and the country\u2019s stock market down 2%. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com, said: Reports that the Five Star Movement and the League, which are in talks to form a coalition government, are considering a debt relief from ECB to the tune of \u20ac250 billion has stoked fears over Italy\u2019s creditworthiness. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has fallen sharply as a result, as too has the euro, and despite an otherwise bullish day for European stocks. Back to the news that the East Coast mainline will be temporarily nationalised after co-owners Virgin and Stagecoach could no longer meet promised payments. Analyst Joe Spooner at Jefferies says: Reversion of East Coast to government operation will no doubt spark a cycle of press commentary about rail nationalisation and the political climate will no doubt fuel a public debate. The more sober reality, we think, is that East Coast was a contract that commercially failed (it was [with hindsight] overbid for - but that\u2019s different to operational failure), Stagecoach has paid the price for that (funded its c.\u00a3180m share of the contingent liabilities) and failure has to be an accepted risk if contracts are to be bid for. The template of allowing the financial consequences of failing franchises to unfold has been reaffirmed for any other that gets into trouble (we retain concerns for the strong growth assumptions with which both TPE and SWR were won at FirstGroup). The political conversation that follows may once again also shape the profile of future franchises put out to tender. Here is our full report on the move: The CBI have accused the MPs who drew up the Carillion report of going over the top. Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, claims the language in the report creates the \u201cwholly inaccurate\u201d impression that Britain\u2019s businesses are all greedy and reckless. Hardie argues that the other apples in the outsourcing barrel aren\u2019t rotten too. \u201cCarillion was a painful lesson for business and government on the dangers of short-termism in public service contracts. This failure should act as a catalyst for a level-headed discussion about how the public and private sectors work together to deliver value to society, as they so often do. \u201c200,000 organisations play a vital role in delivering public services, providing much-needed innovation and investment - whether through building new classrooms or transforming frontline public services - often in very challenging circumstances. \u201cKnee-jerk soundbites on Carillon risk locking out innovation and investment at a time when it\u2019s needed most.\u201d It\u2019s true that the report doesn\u2019t pull any punches, with Frank Field MP accusing Carillion\u2019s directors of stuffing their mouths with gold rather than running the company properly. Getting back to Carillion...... smaller construction firms are welcoming today\u2019s parliamentary report into the company\u2019s collapse. The Specialist Engineering Contractors\u2019 (SEC) group, which represents engineering groups, says Carillion was not along in abusing its suppliers. The SEC\u2019s CEO, professor Rudi Klein, says: \u201cUnfortunately Carillion is not alone. Payment and contractual abuse is rife in the construction industry.\u201d SEC Group have drawn up a four-point plan to protect small suppliers, and prevent another Carillion: All public sector projects should use project bank accounts so that everybody is paid within short timescales from the same \u201cpot\u201d. The Public Contracts Regulations 2015 should be amended to mandate 30 day payments on all public sector contracts and sub-contracts. Suppliers failing to pay within these timescales must be excluded from public sector works. Retention monies should be ring-fenced in a protected scheme. The Small Business Commissioner should have the power to fine large companies for poor treatment of their supply chains. Our financial editor, Nils Pratley, agrees that Ben Broadbent has blown his chance of succeeding Mark Carney: The chancellor\u2019s job of choosing the next governor of the Bank of England just got slightly easier. A basic requirement of being the nation\u2019s senior central banker is an ability to avoid making crassly sexist remarks. Ben Broadbent, one of four deputy governors and thus an internal candidate for the big job, has just failed the test after describing the UK economy as \u201cmenopausal\u201d. More here: Here\u2019s some reaction to the news that the Conservative government is bucking its traditional opposition to nationalisation..... Newsflash: Britain\u2019s East Coast main line, which run between London and Edinburgh, is being nationalised again. The government has decided to terminate the existing East Coast rail franchise operated by Stagecoach and Virgin Trains, and take it back into public control. The government is announcing it now, but Stagecoach have already jumped the gun by issuing a statement to the City. Ben Broadbent\u2019s comments may cloud his future at the Bank of England, says Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward. She writes: Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent was forced to apologize after describing the U.K. economy as \u201cmenopausal,\u201d putting the central bank in a new communications controversy. The remarks in an interview with the Daily Telegraph sparked complaints about sexism and ageism. The timing was particularly unfortunate for the BOE, coming two days after Governor Mark Carney hosted a conference on diversity in central banking. They follow a slew of criticism over the bank\u2019s messaging on monetary policy, which dominated Carney\u2019s interest-rate press conference last week. Lauren Chiren, a menopausal coach, has written to Ben Broadbent - explaining why describing the UK economy as menopausal is a problem. Chiren says: This is another example of gender power and ignorance, and placing blame on women for something that they have no control over. It is appalling, that in 2018, women\u2019s issues are still being used as metaphors, and scapegoats, to avoid actually addressing the underlying issues that are really causing slumps in the economy. She has also invited Broadbent to a coaching session, to learn more about menopause, and \u201cthe power and wisdom\u201d that menopausal women provide in the workplace and beyond. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the CEO of Virgin Money who led a government review into gender equality in the financial sector, offer some personal insight into the issue: \u201cWhen I read this I thought about my own menopause and was sure he meant that the future is hard work, challenging, renewing, worth fighting for, 100% positive and constantly HOT!\u201d Several politicians have also tweeted their criticism of deputy governor Ben Broadbent, which rather confirms that he may have sunk his chances of rising to the governorship. Clare Perry, Britain\u2019s minister for Energy and Clean Growth, says the menopausal comment was out of order: [andropausal is associated with a drop in testosterone] Hear hear, say fellow Conservative MP Rachel Maclean, and Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson. A former Bank of England policymaker, Dame Kate Barker, also believes Ben Broadbent\u2019s comments are out of line. Barker served on the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee from 2001 to 2010. Although Broadbent\u2019s apology was swift, it hasn\u2019t stopped the backlash. Fran Boait of the Positive Money campaign group isn\u2019t impressed: Here\u2019s classics professor Barbara Graziosi: The head of the CBI, Carolyn Fairbairn, has also criticised Ben Broadbent\u2019s comments. Fairbairn says: \u201cThis poor choice of words is very disappointing and distracts from the real issue at hand. Productivity has been the UK\u2019s Achilles heel for far too long. Our priority should be tackling the low productivity that can lead to higher regional inequality. Solving this will help build a stronger economy that raises living standards and wages for everyone.\u201d Broadbent\u2019s gaffe has reduced his chances of succeeding Mark Carney at the top of the Bank of England, says the FT\u2019s Chris Giles: Carney is due to leave the BoE next summer, so the formal search for his successor will begin soon. Describing the UK economy as \u2018menopausal\u2019 will be a black mark on Broadbent\u2019s CV. Giles says: Ben Broadbent undermined his chances of becoming governor of the Bank of England on Wednesday after having to apologise for describing the UK economy as \u201c menopausal \u201d.... The embarrassment felt in Threadneedle Street for using gender-loaded language is all the more acute because the bank has been trying to extinguish such terms from daily use within the institution. NEWSFLASH: Ben Broadbent has issued an apology. The deputy governor says he\u2019s sorry for his \u2018poor choice of language\u2019 and regrets the offence caused by describing the UK economy as menopausal. He also insists that he was referring to \u2018climacteric\u2019 - a biological term that does apply to men and women, and which has been used by economists. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady has criticised Ben Broadbent for comparing Britain\u2019s economic slowdown to the menopause. She tells us: \u201cThis kind of language is totally inappropriate. There\u2019s no need to resort to lazy, sexist comments to describe problems in the economy.\u201d Ben Broadbent, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, is facing heavy criticism this morning after declaring that the UK economy is entering a \u201cmenopausal\u201d era. Broadbent used the term in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, as he tried to explain how Britain could be experiencing a trough between the digital era and the next big technological breakthrough. Broadbent, who had been seen as a candidate to become governor (before today, anyway...), was trying to compare today\u2019s productivity problems to the Victorian-era lull between the ages of steam and electricity. My colleague Angela Monaghan explains: Broadbent said the term applied by economic historians to describe such a slump was \u201cclimacteric\u201d, which he said essentially means \u201cmenopausal, but can apply to both genders. You\u2019ve passed your productive peak.\u201d His comments drew criticism on Twitter. Robert Peston, political editor of ITV, tweeted that Broadbent\u2019s language was \u201csloppy and potentially offensive\u201d. Peston isn\u2019t the only one to feel that Broadbent\u2019s comments are insulting.....particularly as the Bank itself only has one women on its nine-strong monetary policy committee. For example, here\u2019s Se\u00e1n Hand, the deputy pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Warwick Here\u2019s more critical reaction: The body which governs Britain\u2019s auditors has announced that it is making \u2018good progress\u2019 in its probe into Carillion. Britain\u2019s Financial Reporting Council is examining Carillion\u2019s financial statements and audits over several years, to decide whether any disciplinary action is needed. The FRC say: Given the clear public interest in this matter, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is providing an update on its investigation into Carillion. The main areas of focus for the investigations of KPMG\u2019s audit of Carillion (2014 \u2013 2017) and of two finance directors Richard Adam and Zafar Khan are: contract accounting; reverse factoring; pensions; goodwill and going concern. Good progress with the investigation is being made by the FRC\u2019s team of lawyers and forensic accountants. That will be cold comfort for the 2,000 Carillion workers who have lost their jobs, and the tens of thousands whose pensions will be hit by its collapse. And let\u2019s not forget that the FRC is criticised in today\u2019s parliamentary report, for being too supine. As the MPs put it: Chronically passive, they do not seek to influence corporate decision-making with the realistic threat of intervention. Action is part of their brief. They require cultural change as well. Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the BEIS committee, is calling for Britain\u2019s Big Four accountancy firms to be broken up in the light of the Carillion crisis. Today\u2019s report concludes that the auditors failed to spot Carillion\u2019s crippling financial problems because they were too focused on their own fees. KPMG gets special treatment: KMPG was paid \u00a329 million to act as Carillion\u2019s auditor for 19 years. It did not once qualify its audit opinion, complacently signing off the directors\u2019 increasingly fantastical figures. In failing to exercise professional scepticism towards Carillion\u2019s accounting judgements over the course of its tenure as Carilion\u2019s auditor, KPMG was complicit in them. More competition would help to clean up the sector, argues Reeves. She says: \u201cThe auditors should also be in the dock for this catastrophic crash. \u201cThe sorry saga of Carillion is further evidence that the Big Four accountancy firms are prioritising their own profits ahead of good governance at the companies they are supposed to be putting under the microscope. \u201cKMPG, PwC, Deloitte and EY pocket millions of pounds for their lucrative audit work - even when they fail to warn about corporate disasters like Carillion. \u201cIt is a parasitical relationship which sees the auditors prosper, regardless of what happens to the companies, employees and investors who rely on their scrutiny.\u201d We\u2019ve gathered some of the best quotes from the report: Former Carillion finance director Richard Adam isn\u2019t best pleased with the MPs\u2019 report. Adam, who was FD between 2007 and 2016, says: Despite retiring over a year before Carillion went into insolvency, I am deeply saddened by the events that have since overtaken the company. The reasons for the collapse are clearly complex, however, I reject the unwarranted conclusions the Committees have reached concerning my role at the company. I have objected to the Committees about quotes that they have misattributed to me. I look forward to contributing to the due process and conclusion of the various investigations that are still ongoing.\u2019 Adam is referring to board minutes showing that Carillion\u2019s pension trustees thought that he saw pension payments as a \u201cwaste of money\u201d . Adam says there is no evidence he actually thought this. You can read the full report here. The MPs are especially critical of three top directors who steered Carillion towards its demise. As the report puts it: \u201cThe problems that caused the collapse of Carillion were long in the making, as too was the rotten corporate culture that allowed them to occur\u201d. Former chairman Philip Green, CEO Richard Howson and finance director Richard Adam get particular treatment. Richard Adam was Carillion\u2019s Finance Director for 10 years. He was the architect of Carillion\u2019s aggressive accounting policies and resolutely refused to make adequate contributions to the company\u2019s pension schemes, which he considered a \u201cwaste of money\u201d. His voluntary departure at the end of 2016 and subsequent sale of all his shares were the actions of a man who knew where the company was heading. Richard Howson, Chief Executive from 2012 to 2017, was the figurehead for a business that careered progressively out of control under his misguidedly self-assured leadership. Philip Green joined the board in 2011 and became Chairman in 2014. He was an unquestioning optimist when his role was to challenge. Remarkably, to the end he thought he was the man to head a \u201cnew leadership team\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Four months after UK outsourcing group Carillion spectacularly collapsed, the people behind its demise are being held to account. A truly damning parliamentary report released today has concluded that recklessness, hubris, greed and incompetence contributed to the demise of the company, which ran major construction projects and operated public services including school meals and cleaning. It shows that accounting tricks and a relentless squeeze on contractors also helped Carillion to disguise its financial position - until it blew up in January with a \u00a32.6bn pension black hole, and \u00a32bn of debts. The report says: Carillion used aggressive accounting policies to present a rosy picture to the markets. Maintaining stated contract margins in the face of evidence that showed they were optimistic, and accounting for revenue for work that not even been agreed, enabled it to maintain apparently healthy revenue flows. It used its early payment facility for suppliers as a credit card, but did not account for it as borrowing. The only cash supporting its profits was that banked by denying money to suppliers. Whether or not all this was within the letter of accountancy law, it was intended to deceive lenders and investors. It was also entirely unsustainable: eventually, Carillion would need to get the cash in. The report sweeps aside Carillion\u2019s claim that it was a victim of bad luck, and delays to some major contracts. Instead, it labels the company as \u201ca giant and unsustainable corporate time bomb\u201d, adding: My colleague Rob Davies explains: A damning 100-page report compiled by two select committees, published today, found that directors prioritised senior executive bonus payouts and dividends for shareholders even as the firm neared collapse, while treating pension payments as a \u201cwaste of money\u201d. Frank Field, who chairs the work and pension committee, said: \u201cSame old story. Same old greed. A board of directors too busy stuffing their mouths with gold to show any concern for the welfare of their workforce or their pensioners.\u201d Almost nobody emerges from this report with any credit. The directors come out of it particularly badly. The report is pockmarked with heavy criticism - they are accused of being \u2018negligent\u2019, \u2018 delusional\u2019 and reckless in their running of the company. The MPs say Carillion unacceptably used its own suppliers to \u201cprop up their failing business model\u201d, while top bosses banked large salaries which will cushion them from the company\u2019s collapse. Unlike the rest of the company, who face reduced pensions thanks to the \u00a32.6bn pension black hole left behind. MPs want the Insolvency Service to give serious consideration to disqualifying them. Carillion\u2019s board are blamed for allowing a rotten corporate culture to develop, and for not challenging management as debts rose. Carillion\u2019s auditors, KPMG, are also in the dock for a string of failures. They failed spotting the problems at Carillion, and have an unheathily close relationship with their customers, the MPs say. The regulators are accused of timidity, and a passive mindset that means they didn\u2019t get involved until too late. MPs also point the finger at themselves - well, successive governments, anyway, who have demanded cheap services from outsourcers, not quality. But there\u2019s one exception: finance director Emma Mercer is credited with speaking the truth and challenging the status quo as she uncovered Carillion\u2019s practices in 2017. They say: Emma Mercer is the only Carillion director to emerge from the collapse with any credit. She demonstrated a willingness to speak the truth and challenge the status quo, fundamental qualities in a director that were not evident in any of her colleagues. Her individual actions should be taken into account by official investigations of the collapse of the company. We hope that her association with Carillion does not unfairly colour her future career. The MP\u2019s conclusion is that serious changes are needed, to avoid another UK company - and its customers and staff - suffering Carillion\u2019s fate. They say: Carillion was the most spectacular corporate collapse for some time. The price will be high, in jobs, businesses, trust and reputation. Most companies are not run with Carillion\u2019s reckless short-termism, and most company directors are far more concerned by the wider consequences of their actions than the Carillion board. But that should not obscure the fact that Carillion became a giant and unsustainable corporate time bomb in a regulatory and legal environment still in existence today. The individuals who failed in their responsibilities, in running Carillion and in challenging, advising or regulating it, were often acting entirely in line with their personal incentives. Carillion could happen again, and soon. Rather than a source of despair, that can be an opportunity. The Government can grasp the initiative with an ambitious and wide-ranging set of reforms that reset our systems of corporate accountability in the long-term public interest. It would have our support in doing so. I\u2019ll be mopping up reaction to the report through the day. Also coming up today: Worries about the global economy are building after Japan suffered its first economic contraction in two years. Japanese GDP shrank at an annualised rate of 0.6% in the last quarter, new figures show, with consumer spending and business investment both down. It ends Japan\u2019s longest expansion since the 1980s. More on that shortly... Investors are getting edgy about the prospect of several more US interest rate rises this year. Last night the Dow Jones industrial average shed almost 200 points, as traders worry that the era of easy money is over. In the eurozone, new inflation figures will probably confirm that prices only rose by 1.2% in the last year - below the target. Plus, new US housing and oil inventory statistics might move the markets Here\u2019s the agenda: 10am BST: Eurozone consumer price inflation figures for April 1.30pm BST: US housing statistics 3.30pm BST: US weekly oil inventory figures",

There was good news in all the components with manufacturing seeing output rise 0.5% while utilities rose 1.9% and mining was up 1.1%</p> <p>The growth in mining reflects the rapid rise in oil and gas rig counts in response to higher prices. With oil not far from $80/bbl and US production efficiency continuing to improve this component will continue making positive contributions to overall US economic activity.</p> <p>Meanwhile manufacturing looks in great shape with the ISM and durable goods reports suggesting order books are very healthy \u2013 note output would have been up 0.6% were it not for auto weakness. Utilities is a bit of a surprise given output had already been really strong because of a particularly wintery start to the year, driving heating demand.

Nonetheless, if it hadn\u2019t been for the oil and gas revolution the story wouldn\u2019t be quite as rosy. Manufacturing output is still more than 5 percent down on the peak of November 2007, which means President Trump\u2019s is unlikely to reverse course on his claims of unfair foreign competition anytime soon. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamsonChris/status/996742411404693504\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/manufacturing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#manufacturing</a> growth accelerated in April, as flagged in advance by our PMI.

Maintaining stated contract margins in the face of evidence that showed they were optimistic, and accounting for revenue for work that not even been agreed, enabled it to maintain apparently healthy revenue flows.</p> <p>It used its early payment facility for suppliers as a credit card, but did not account for it as borrowing. The only cash supporting its profits was that banked by denying money to suppliers. Whether or not all this was within the letter of accountancy law, it was intended to deceive lenders and investors. It was also entirely unsustainable: eventually, Carillion would need to get the cash in.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report sweeps aside Carillion\u2019s claim that it was a victim of bad luck, and delays to some major contracts. Instead, it labels the company as \u201ca giant and unsustainable corporate time bomb\u201d, adding:</p> <p>My colleague Rob Davies explains:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A damning 100-page report compiled by two select committees, published today, found that directors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/26/carillion-bosses-displayed-greed-on-stilts-mps-claim\">prioritised senior executive bonus payouts</a> and dividends for shareholders even as the firm neared collapse, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/22/mps-attack-pension-regulator-at-carillion-inquiry\">treating pension payments as a \u201cwaste of money\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Frank Field, who chairs the work and pension committee, said: \u201cSame old story.

Most companies are not run with Carillion\u2019s reckless short-termism, and most company directors are far more concerned by the wider consequences of their actions than the Carillion board. </p> <p>But that should not obscure the fact that Carillion became a giant and unsustainable corporate time bomb in a regulatory and legal environment still in existence today.</p> <p>The individuals who failed in their responsibilities, in running Carillion and in challenging, advising or regulating it, were often acting entirely in line with their personal incentives. Carillion could happen again, and soon. Rather than a source of despair, that can be an opportunity. </p> <p>The Government can grasp the initiative with an ambitious and wide-ranging set of reforms that reset our systems of corporate accountability in the long-term public interest.

      "bodyText": "Tata Steel moved back into profit at the start of this year, in large part due to a boost of more than \u00a31.5bn from the restructuring of its pension scheme, prompting unions to demand that cuts to members\u2019 benefits be reversed. The Indian steelmaker swung to a profit of 146.9bn rupees (\u00a31.6bn) in the three months to the end of March, from a loss of 11.7bn rupees a year earlier. It benefited from a one-off gain of \u00a31.54bn related to the restructuring of its British pension scheme. Britain\u2019s Pensions Regulator agreed last year to allow Tata Steel UK to reduce its \u00a315bn pension scheme liabilities, the main stumbling block in the Indian steelmaker\u2019s efforts to merge its European business \u2013 which includes the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales \u2013 with Germany\u2019s Thyssenkrupp. Of 122,000 UK pension scheme members, 83,000 opted to join the new British Steel pension scheme (BSPS) \u2013 one of the biggest in the country \u2013 and took a cut in benefits, in return for investment to secure jobs. Core benefits were not cut but pension increases under the new scheme were reduced to the statutory minimum. The Community union says effectively increases are now based on the consumer prices index rather than the retail prices index, which means they will be lower. The remaining members moved to the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), a government-backed pensions lifeboat, which entailed a 10% cut in benefits for most members, except existing pensioners. According to trustees and the Community union, the new BSPS was better for most people than the PPF. Tata employs more than 8,000 people across the UK, including 3,500 in Port Talbot. The Pensions Regulator said at the time that such arrangements were rare but necessary in this case to prevent the company becoming insolvent. The National Trade Union Steel Coordinating Committee, which includes the Community and Unite unions, said the unions had helped deliver the new British Steel pension scheme because \u201call the experts told us the alternative was the inevitable insolvency of Tata Steel UK\u201d. \u201cIt was always expected the new BSPS would start with a significant buffer to enable it to pay out benefits to all members on a low-risk basis. We should be absolutely clear that this buffer is not Tata\u2019s money, it is scheme members\u2019 money which is ringfenced to pay out benefits over the lifetime of the scheme. \u201cThe surplus for the new BSPS is higher than we expected, which we welcome as it strengthens our case for benefits to be restored.\u201d The unions have called on Tata and the pension scheme trustees to sit down with them. The first priority for the unions will be improving pension increases for members with pre-1997 service. The pension scheme trustees said Tata\u2019s \u201csurplus was calculated using best estimate assumptions\u201d. The trustees are working on their own formal actuarial valuation of the BSPS, using \u201cprudent assumptions\u201d. This valuation is still expected to show a surplus, but a smaller one than Tata reported. In February, the work and pensions committee said members were targeted by \u201cvulture\u201d financial advisers during the changes and accused the government, Tata and regulators of failing to protect them from a \u201cmajor mis-selling scandal\u201d. Frank Field, the Labour MP and chair of work and pensions committee, said on Wednesday: \u201cThis is a promising beginning that offers some hope to the British Steel pensioners, who were left stranded at the mercy of the vultures circling the scheme for too long. Tata should clearly restate its commitment to increase payments to pensions at the earliest opportunity, as agreed with the trustees.\u201d Stephen Kinnock, the Labour MP whose Aberavon constituency includes the Port Talbot plant, said Tata was \u201clogically and morally obliged to ensure that the benefits are restored to the members\u201d. \u201cAlong with the members I now look forward to seeing a detailed proposal from Tata Steel, setting out how it will set about restoring and redistributing the benefits to the members.\u201d",

All permanent staff, present and future, at all seniority levels will receive shares but couriers will miss out because Deliveroo classes them as self-employed contractors rather than employees. Will Shu, the chief executive and founder of Deliveroo, said the move was \u201chis way of thanking staff at the company; a way of making sure this truly is our company in every way\u201d. He said: \u201cEmployees at Deliveroo have made the company what it is today and what sets us apart is our immense hunger to win, strong focus and care, and a clear vision for the future. \u201cOur phenomenal growth and success has been made possible thanks to the hard work, commitment and passion of the people who make this company what it is, and that deserves recognition, which is why I want all employees to be owners in Deliveroo and to have a real stake in the company\u2019s future as we expand and grow.\u201d The share handout is seen as a first step towards a potential flotation for the company, which is valued at more than $2bn after a fundraising round last year. However, Sky News, which first revealed the share handout, said a stock market listing, in New York or London, was unlikely for at least 18 months. The float would crystalise a huge fortune for Shu, a former investment banker, and potentially mean big handouts for those staff who receive shares. Shu, a former investment banker who set up Deliveroo from his London flat in 2013, increased his salary to \u00a3124,999 in 2016 when he handed out close to \u00a34.5m in share bonuses to directors and other head office staff, despite a 300%-plus widening in losses, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The latest share handout comes as Deliveroo faces legal action over treatment of its workers. About 20 couriers, supported by the law firm Leigh Day, are seeking compensation for not receiving holiday pay as they say they are employees and not, as the company argues, self-employed contractors. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which is attempting to raise \u00a350,000 to continue its separate legal action over workers\u2019 treatment at Deliveroo, said the share handout was a \u201cstunt\u201d. \u201cThis announcement is just one more example of Deliveroo\u2019s self-serving publicity stunts.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A deputy governor of the Bank of England has apologised for saying the UK economy was in a \u201cmenopausal\u201d phase after passing its productive peak. Ben Broadbent was accused of using \u201clazy, sexist\u201d language when he compared the current state of the economy to the late Victorian era, when a pause between steam technology and the age of electricity contributed to a slump in productivity. In an interview with the Telegraph, Broadbent said the term applied by economic historians to describe such a slump was \u201cclimacteric\u201d, which he said essentially means \u201cmenopausal, but can apply to both genders. You\u2019ve passed your productive peak.\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said the language Broadbent used in his interview was \u201ctotally inappropriate\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to resort to lazy, sexist comments to describe problems in the economy,\u201d she said. Broadbent issued a statement on Wednesday morning after his comments drew widespread criticism: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for my poor choice of language in an interview with the Telegraph yesterday and regret the offence caused. \u201cI was explaining the meaning of the word \u201cclimacteric\u201d, a term used by economic historians to describe a period of low productivity growth during the 19th century. Economic productivity is something which affects every one of us, of all ages and genders.\u201d Jayne-Anne Gadhia, the chief executive of Virgin Money UK, who led a government review on boosting gender equality in the financial sector, said: \u201cWhen I read this I thought about my own menopause and was sure he meant that the future is hard work, challenging, renewing, worth fighting for, 100% positive and constantly HOT!\u201d Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, the business lobby group, said Broadbent\u2019s comments in the interview detracted from the crucial issue of weak productivity and living standards. \u201cThis poor choice of words is very disappointing and distracts from the real issue at hand,\u201d she said. \u201cProductivity has been the UK\u2019s achilles heel for far too long. \u201cOur priority should be tackling the low productivity that can lead to higher regional inequality. Solving this will help build a stronger economy that raises living standards and wages for everyone.\u201d Vivienne Artz, president of Women in Banking &amp; Finance, said: \u201cWomen aged 50 and over are the fastest-growing group of employees in the UK. Menopause is experienced by all women, and those in the menopause years constitute an estimated 20% of the workforce. \u201cTo refer to menopause as being \u201cpast one\u2019s productive peak\u201d in the context of the economy ignores the reality that women are often at the peak of their careers during their menopause years.\u201d Robert Peston, the political editor of ITV, tweeted that Broadbent\u2019s language was \u201csloppy and potentially offensive\u201d. Louise Newson, a GP and medical writer, said it was a \u201cterrible analogy\u201d, while another Twitter user, Rebecca Harvey, said it was a shocking example of #everydaysexism. Broadbent, a former economist at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, is considered a potential successor to the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney. As deputy governor for monetary policy, he sits on the monetary policy committee, which is responsible for setting interest rates. Carney has previously attributed a 25% gender pay gap at the Bank \u2013 with male employees paid almost a quarter more than their female colleagues \u2013 to the fact that men dominate the most senior positions at Threadneedle Street. Of the nine members on the MPC, just one \u2013 Silvana Tenreyro \u2013 is a woman. Broadbent gave the interview after official figures showed that productivity fell 0.5% in the first three months of 2018, at a time when employment in Britain hit a fresh record high but growth slowed to just 0.1%.",

Solving this will help build a stronger economy that raises living standards and wages for everyone.\u201d </p> <p>Vivienne Artz, president of Women in Banking &amp; Finance, said: \u201cWomen aged 50 and over are the fastest-growing group of employees in the UK. Menopause is experienced by all women, and those in the menopause years constitute an estimated 20% of the workforce. </p> <p>\u201cTo refer to menopause as being \u201cpast one\u2019s productive peak\u201d in the context of the economy ignores the reality that women are often at the peak of their careers during their menopause years.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Peston, the political editor of ITV, tweeted that Broadbent\u2019s language was \u201csloppy and potentially offensive\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/allisonpearson/status/996509618036793344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Highly offensive!

Kavalake, the holding company for the group \u2013 which includes some of London\u2019s most famous restaurants such as Petrus, Savoy Grill, Maze and Bread Street Kitchen \u2013 reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.8m in the year to the end of August 2017. The business was hit by a \u00a31.75m legal bill for costs in a long-running legal dispute with Rowan Seibel, Ramsay\u2019s former business partner in the Fat Cow, the Los Angeles restaurant that was shut in 2014. The group, which has only made a profit in one year since 2012, reported a small dip of 1% in revenues to \u00a351.4m. Revenues were hit by the overhaul and five-month closure of Plane Food, Ramsay\u2019s venture at Heathrow\u2019s terminal 5, which contributed to revenue from its UK restaurant operation falling from \u00a348.3m to \u00a345.9m. Revenue from the group\u2019s international operations, which has licence agreements for 18 restaurants around the world, rose 52% year on year to \u00a35.4m. The company said it continues to be on the expansion trail, with five new venues this year, including a Bread Street Kitchen in Sanya, China, and four other restaurants in North America, including a new concept in Las Vegas called Hell\u2019s Kitchen, which opened in January. \u201cA number of new international contracts are being actively negotiated, however, contracts have yet to be signed,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe global spread of our restaurants means the business is not reliant upon one location and is therefore well placed to adapt and adjust to softer trading conditions.\u201d Employee numbers grew by 7% from 766 to 820, with restaurant staff numbers rising from 709 to 749. The wage bill rose from \u00a316.8m to \u00a317.4m. The group, which holds an interest in 14 London-based restaurants, is to shut one of its most high-profile outlets, Maze, which is in the London Marriott hotel in Grosvenor Square, next January after 14 years. It will be replaced with a concept restaurant launching next year under a new 10-year lease. \u201cThe variety and choice of location throughout London helps to minimise any risk of dependency on one brand or economic area,\u201d the group said.",

      "bodyText": "Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis on Wednesday announced the retirement of its top legal expert, as he apologised for payments made by the firm to Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen. The announcement came after Novartis was dragged into the scandal over Cohen\u2019s payment of $130,000 to US adult film actor Stormy Daniels just days before the 2016 presidential election. US special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the payments as a strand of his wider investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and allegations of collusion and obstruction of justice by the Trump campaign. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels, who has stated she prefers to go by her stage name rather than her real name of Stephanie Clifford, more than a decade ago. But one of the newest members of Trump\u2019s legal team, former federal prosecutor and New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, has acknowledged the US president reimbursed Cohen for the hush money. Last week, Daniels\u2019 lawyer Michael Avenatti wrote on Twitter that Novartis and US telecoms giant AT&amp;T had used the services of Cohen\u2019s firm Essential Consultants \u2013 the same company used to make the payment to Daniels. Cohen is currently under federal investigation in New York, separately from the Mueller investigation but triggered by advice from the special counsel. On 9 May, Novartis said it had signed a one-year contract for $100,000 a month with Cohen\u2019s firm in February 2017, seeking advice on the new administration\u2019s public health policy. Following a meeting with Cohen, the company changed its mind, although Novartis was contractually obliged to pay Cohen the full $1.2m. Telecoms giant AT&amp;T, which has acknowledged paying about $600,000 to Cohen and was also named by Daniels\u2019 lawyer, has also said it was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d to hire Trump\u2019s lawyer, even as it maintained its actions were legal. On Wednesday, Novartis\u2019s general counsel Feliz Ehrat apologised for making the deal in the first place. \u201cAlthough the contract was legally in order, it was an error. As a co-signatory with our former CEO, I take personal responsibility to bring the public debate on this matter to an end,\u201d Ehrat said in a statement issued by the firm. Novartis has insisted that its current chief executive, Vas Narasimhan, was \u201cin no way involved\u201d with the agreement with Cohen\u2019s firm, which pre-dated his leadership.",

A basic requirement of being the nation\u2019s senior central banker is an ability to avoid making crassly sexist remarks.

      "bodyText": "Sales at Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia retail empire dropped below \u00a32bn during 2017 when a surge in online transactions hit trade in its shops. Turnover at Arcadia Group, which owns fashion brands including Topshop, Topman and Dorothy Perkins, fell 5.6% to \u00a31.9bn, a decline of \u00a3113m. \u201cThe retail environment remains highly competitive and challenging,\u201d said Ian Grabiner. The Arcadia chief executive said online sales had jumped 11.5%. \u201cThe increase in digital sales is taking place at the expense of traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing as consumers embrace the opportunity to purchase across all the channels available to them.\u201d Green\u2019s retail empire continues to feel the aftershocks of the collapse in 2016 of BHS, which he sold to Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt, for just \u00a31 a year earlier. The collapse of the department store chain would come back to haunt Green, who agreed to pump \u00a3363m into the BHS pension scheme after coming under intense scrutiny during a public postmortem led by MPs. The BHS scandal, as well as the deteriorating financial performance of Arcadia, has taken a toll on the fortune controlled by Green\u2019s Monaco-based wife, Tina. The couple\u2019s wealth was marked down \u00a3787m to \u00a32bn in the Sunday Times Rich List at the weekend. The Green family, who paid themselves \u00a31.2bn in 2005, did not take a dividend in 2017. Like other traditional retailers, Arcadia, which also owns the Evans and Wallis brands, is fighting for sales amid weak consumer confidence and fewer shopper visits. The competitive landscape has also intensified as no-frills chain Primark continues to expand in the UK and websites such as Boohoo and Asos suck sales out of the high street. Accounts for Taveta Investments, the Green family company, showed a recovery in pre-tax profits at Arcadia after a disastrous 2016. They increased from \u00a336.8m to \u00a353.5m, a figure whittled down by \u00a329m of exceptional charges. In 2015 the retail group made a profit of \u00a3172.2m. In February Green denied he was in talks to sell Arcadia to the Chinese textiles firm Shandong Ruyi. \u201cWhile we have found headline sales and profits disappointing, we remain a strongly cash-generative business and had a positive net cash balance at the year end of \u00a3157.2m,\u201d said Grabiner. The accounts also showed that the deficit in the Arcadia pensions fund had come down from \u00a3427m in 2016 to \u00a3300m after the company increased its contributions and changed some of the assumptions used to calculate the deficit.",

The airline \u2013 boosted by the collapse of rivals such as Monarch and Alitalia last year \u2013 made a rare operating profit during the traditionally loss-making autumn and winter months. Its headline figure of \u00a38m did not include heavy losses at its new Berlin Tegel operation, acquired from Air Berlin in January. But even taking the impact of Berlin Tegel into account, pretax losses were down \u2013 from \u00a3236m in the first half of last year to \u00a368m in the same period this year. Much of the improvement is down to the collapse of rivals, which enabled fares to rise by about 5%. EasyJet carried almost 37 million passengers, up 3 million from last year, with total revenue jumping almost 20% to \u00a32.2bn. The airline said the big increase in revenues was largely down to baggage fees, fuller planes across its network and the timing of Easter. Chief executive Johan Lundgren said EasyJet Holidays would look to build up its market share, which was at a fraction of its potential. He said: \u201cWe have today 500,000 customers who book hotels with us, but 20 million of our customers are flying with us and booking hotels elsewhere.\u201d EasyJet Holidays is run by a third party, with Easyjet getting a share of revenues. But under new chief executive Garry Wilson, a former colleague of Lundgren\u2019s at tour operator TUI, the airline will now negotiate contracts direct with hotels. Lundgren said this should mean cheaper, more flexible packages than rival holiday firms, whose planes fly to destinations once or twice a week. He added that the airline would introduce a new loyalty programme next year. He declined to provide details, but said it would be \u201cmore affordable and convenient than the present schemes\u201d. He denied fares were set to rise overall this summer, despite less capacity in the market: \u201cThey\u2019re not necessarily higher: you\u2019re going to see fares coming down in some places. We need to be sure we are priced competitively.\u201d EasyJet said its annual profits were likely to be between \u00a3530m and \u00a3580m, a third higher than 2016-17. Shares in the company rose 3% to \u00a317.38. At the beginning of 2017, they were changing hands at just over \u00a310.",

      "bodyText": "The global engineering company AECOM, the firm that had been designing Adani\u2019s $2.2bn rail line to its Carmichael coalmine, says that it has \u201cdemobilised\u201d and is no longer working the project with the Indian conglomerate \u2013 but Adani says it is still \u201c100% committed to the Carmichael project\u201d. Engineering design contracts often have several milestones at which point the design is reviewed and the project then moves to another phase. The AECOM contract was ended at such a milestone with all contracts honoured. But sources have told Guardian Australia the expectation had been that AECOM would shepherd the rail project to its conclusion. Adani remains silent on its attempts to finance the Carmichael project, having missed two deadlines, the most recent in March. AECOM\u2019s departure from the project comes amid increasing uncertainty around Adani\u2019s ability to finance the Carmichael coalmine. The company had sought assistance for its rail project through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif) but the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has vetoed a federal loan. Adani has also put part of its Townsville office up for rent. A spokesman from AECOM told Guardian Australia the company was no longer working on the Adani rail project. \u201cOur people have demobilised,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve handed over our design to the client. It\u2019s up to them what happens after this.\u201d A spokeswoman for Adani said: \u201cAdani\u2019s commercial relationship with AECOM continues. The current phase of their engineering and design for the rail project is now complete. \u201cAECOM remains an important partner for Adani and we appreciate the quality of work they have completed to date and look forward to continuing to work with them. \u201cIt is normal for contractor numbers to change through the life of a project as milestones are reached and stages of work are completed ... a new phase of activity on the project has begun, this involves working with other consultants and advisors to prepare for mine infrastructure construction and operation. \u201cWe remain 100% committed to the Carmichael project.\u201d Guardian Australia understands AECOM stopped working on the project after the engineering design company was unable to gain access to key sites in order to progress its design work. The reasons for that are unclear. The executive director at Market Forces, Julien Vincent, said it was another setback for the project. \u201cIn the past six months, Adani has lost its mine construction partner in Downer EDI, while Queensland rail company Aurizon has withdrawn its Naif application to build an alternative rail line to the Galilee basin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time Australian governments and Adani both realise that coal is the past and instead focus on the future.\u201d",

The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which has backed a series of employment tribunal cases pushing for a better deal for delivery couriers and cleaners, needs a cash injection as it faces a \u00a310,000 bill for costs relating to an unsuccessful attempt to win union recognition at the food delivery firm. In a key legal ruling, the Central Arbitration Committee, a body that resolves worker disputes, said the Deliveroo\u2019s riders were self-employed contractors and not entitled to holiday pay or the national minimum wage because the firm had given them the right to allocate a substitute to do work for them. It is understood that the bill from that case, made up largely of Deliveroo\u2019s legal costs, which IWGB may have to cover after losing, puts the union in a tenuous financial position. The IWGB also wants to fund a high court challenge to a ruling against the union seeking a judicial review of the CAC decision, slated for 12 June. The union has turned to Crowdjustice, which has previously been used to raise funds for legal action against council budget cuts and to challenge European states\u2019 lack of action on climate change. Jason Moyer-Lee, the general secretary of the IWGB, said: \u201cIn a world where the government does nothing to end exploitation in the so-called \u2018gig economy\u2019, the onus falls entirely on workers and their unions.

      "bodyText": "The forecasts for wages growth in the Turnbull government\u2019s budget are already in doubt, with new data showing Australian wages are struggling to grow above an annual rate of 2%. Bureau of Statistics figures show wages grew by just 0.5% in the March quarter, keeping the annual rate at 2.1% in seasonally adjusted and trend terms. It means national wages will have to grow by 0.7% over the next three months to keep alive the government\u2019s budget forecasts for 2017-18. The budget predicts wages will grow by 2.25% in the 2017-18 financial year, and economists raised doubts about the forecast from the moment the budget was released last week, wondering if it was too optimistic. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The budget forecasts wages will grow at 2.25% this financial year, then 2.75% in 2018-19, followed by 3.25% in 2019-20 and 3.5% in 2020-21. Australian wages have been stuck at an annual pace of 2.1% for the past nine months, after lifting slightly from a historically low 1.9% last year. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, speaking at the National Press Club on Wednesday, said the budget\u2019s wage forecasts were \u201cproblematic\u201d and since budget surpluses are dependant on wage forecasts the government\u2019s surplus plans may face early pressure. He said low wages growth, which was an international problem, was affecting the living standards of all Australians, and Labor was working on a wages policy. \u201cIt\u2019s not all the fault of the government and it\u2019s not all entirely Australian issues,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s an international phenomenon going on here, but I think that any government that just says \u2018oh, it\u2019s all too hard and people won\u2019t have wages growth\u2019 is giving up on one of our core responsibilities.\u201d The ABS data shows private sector wages grew by 1.9% and public sector wages grew 2.3% through the year to March. The ABS chief economist, Bruce Hockman, said the March-quarter wage growth continued a period of \u201csubdued first-quarter rises\u201d. National wage growth was primarily driven by regular increases in the education and training and healthcare and social assistance industries. In the private sector, the public administration and safety industry recorded the lowest growth over the quarter (0.1%). The education and training industry recorded the highest quarterly rise of 0.9%. In the public sector, professional, scientific and technical services recorded the lowest quarterly wages growth of 0.2%. Education and training recorded the highest quarterly rise of 0.8%. The figures come as the Australian Council of Trade Unions has defended its claim for a 7.2% minimum wage rise as the Fair Work Commission concludes hearings for a wage rise to take effect from 1 July. In the FWC hearing on Tuesday, the ACTU criticised the federal government for arguing the transfer system was a better way to help low-paid households. The ACTU wanted to know where the money was in the 2018 budget, arguing \u201call we have is the promise of a little under $10 a week for lower-income workers but it comes with a catch \u2013 a big one \u2013 that it is contingent on locking in tax cuts for higher-income earners over years to come\u201d. The ACTU noted many employers had asked for a 1.9% increase, a wage freeze, while others had asked for real cuts: AiGroup (1.8%), the Master Grocers Association (1.1%) and Restaurant &amp; Catering Industrial (0%). \u201cIt\u2019s also worth remembering that, since business tax cuts started working their way through the system, award reliance increased,\u201d the ACTU representative said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got lower business taxes for many award-reliant employers and, in response, more of them are paying the lowest legal rate of pay they can to their employees and asking that their wages either be frozen in real terms or cut. These employers will not raise wages unless they are forced to. And the panel should force them.\u201d",
