      "bodyText": "Shell is opening a first wave of electric vehicle charging points at its UK petrol stations, in a sign of the far-reaching changes under way in the transport and oil sectors. Drivers will be able to recharge 80% of their battery in half an hour at forecourts in London, Surrey and Derby from this week, with a total of 10 service stations to be equipped with rapid chargers by the end of the year. The move marks the Shell\u2019s first step into the UK electric car sector and comes days after the Anglo-Dutch oil company bought NewMotion, a Dutch firm with 30,000 private charging points at homes and offices in Europe. Shell said the forays into charging were spurred by the swift growth in battery-powered cars, which now number more than 115,000 in the UK, up from almost zero a decade ago. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the electric vehicle market is developing fast. And we want to offer customers choice: it doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of vehicle they\u2019re driving, we want them to drive into a Shell station, refuel in whatever capacity the fuel is,\u201d said Jane Lindsay-Green, UK future fuels manager at Shell. The NewMotion acquisition and service station charging points could prove an important hedge by big oil against the impact of electric cars, which experts said this week would cause petrol demand to peak by 2030. \u201cWe want to make sure we are positioning ourselves for the future,\u201d said Lindsay-Green, who described the two schemes as complementary. Shell acknowledged it was taking baby steps into the market, with just 10 out of its 1,000 fuelling stations in the UK adding charging points to begin with. \u201cThe market is very young. We are learning here. We\u2019ve started very small. It\u2019s 10 sites, it\u2019s certainly not a mass market yet for us,\u201d said Lindsay-Green. The company is also catering for the tiny number of hydrogen cars on UK roads \u2013 believed to number as few as 50 \u2013 and this year installed a hydrogen pump at its Cobham services on the M25. Shell will have three stations with hydrogen refuelling by the end of the year. With rapid electric charging points typically costing $30,000-$50,000 (\u00a322,700-\u00a338,000) each, the 10 electric charging stations mark a minuscule fraction of the $25bn Shell spends on oil each year. But industry watchers said the infrastructure and recent acquisition were noteworthy. Colin McKerracher, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said: \u201cI think it is significant that a major oil company is investing in charging infrastructure and that they bought NewMotion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it spells the end of the pump as we know it, but we are on the way to a world with a broader mix of vehicles on the road, and Shell are making a play to keep their stations relevant.\u201d Greenpeace, which has previously protested at Shell\u2019s UK service stations over its oil drilling plans, said the country needed more charging points. Rosie Rogers, clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \u201cIn order to really kick start the electrification of our road network, we need to see a lot more rapid charge points in petrol station all over the country, as well as in supermarkets, car parks and motorway services.\u201d Branded Shell Recharge, the charging points will cost a discounted 25p per kilowatt hour of power until next June, when the price will revert to its normal level of 49p per kWh. At the normal price, that means recharging a Nissan Leaf from virtually flat to a full charge would cost nearly \u00a320, while a top-end Tesla Model S would cost almost \u00a350. Customers pay via a credit card registered to an app on a pay-as-you-go basis rather than the subscription basis that some electric car charging schemes operate on. The initial locations, all but one of which is in or around London, were chosen based on how busy they are. \u201cLocations that have a lot of through-traffic, and also locations where perhaps the existing electric vehicle infrastructure needs boosting,\u201d said Lindsay-Green. Shell said that in a handful of cases it paid for upgrades to the local energy grid, to make it capable of handling the rapid charging points. The UK is the first market where Shell is piloting the Recharge offering, which is to expand next to the Netherlands.",

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is axing 2,000 store and back office roles as the supermarket chain looks to slash costs by \u00a3500m amid an intensifying price war with Aldi and Lidl. The retailer is restructuring its HR departments, getting rid of 1,400 store-based clerks and another 600 staff based in the back offices that serve the chain as well as Argos and Sainsbury\u2019s bank. \u201cThe UK grocery market is changing at a rapid pace and it\u2019s crucial that we transform the way we operate to meet future challenges and continue to provide customers with best in class service,\u201d said a Sainsbury\u2019s spokesman. All the big supermarket chains have announced recent job cuts as they seek to compete with the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Tesco is shedding 2,300 staff as part of a cost-cutting programme that is hitting head office workers as well as staff based at its Cardiff call centre which will close next year. Thousands of Asda workers are also facing redundancy or a dramatic cut in their working hours as Britain\u2019s third-largest supermarket chain looks to cut costs. Sainsbury\u2019s, which employs about 119,000 full-time staff, is moving towards a centralised HR model as it overhauls to save hundreds of millions of pounds. The company will reach the end of a three-year plan to save \u00a3500m in March 2018 but Mike Coupe, the chief executive, has said it will then embark on a new programme designed to save the same amount again. Sainsbury\u2019s has been working with McKinsey, the management consultancy, on the headcount reduction plan. The changes to HR mean tasks like processing payroll will no longer be done in store. The 600 head office staff affected by the other change, first reported by the Times, are based in Manchester, Coventry, Edinburgh and London. \u201cFollowing a comprehensive review, we are proposing some updates to our HR structures and systems, as well as changes to a number of other support roles,\u201d added Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cThis has been a difficult decision and we appreciate that this will be a tough time for those colleagues affected by the changes.\u201d In March, Sainsbury\u2019s said it was cutting 400 jobs in store while another 4,000 workers would face changes to their working hours as it looked to run its supermarkets more cheaply. The changes included scrapping the night shift in 140 supermarkets. Under the leadership of Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s has sought to broaden its appeal with the \u00a31.4bn purchase of Argos. The deal reduced Sainsbury\u2019s reliance on the highly competitive grocery market and also gave it access to Argos\u2019s fast delivery network. The big four supermarkets \u2013Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons \u2013 are losing market share to Aldi and Lidl, which added \u00a3390m to their sales over the past three months, according to Kantar Worldpanel. That figure was half of thegrocery market\u2019s overall growth in the 12 weeks ending 8 October. Kantar Worldpanel data showed Aldi and Lidl with a combined market share of 12%. However, Moody\u2019s, the debt rating agency, predicts this proportion could rise to 15% over the next three years \u2013 a level that would force rival bosses to rethink their business models again. \u201cWe believe most of the ongoing revenue gains by the discounters will come at the expense of the \u2018big four\u2019,\u201d said David Beadle at Moody\u2019s. \u201cThe only uncertainties are the extent to which inflation and population growth soften the blow of this hit to revenue, and how the loss of market share will be spread out.\u201d The price war with the discounters comes at a time when retailers are struggling to pass on rising costs to hard up shoppers. On Tuesday, official data showed inflation had edged up to 3% \u2013 its highest level since 2012. \u201cRetailers have done a great job of cushioning shoppers from the rising food chain costs they\u2019re experiencing, exacerbated by the weakening pound, but this can\u2019t last for ever,\u201d said Nielsen analyst Mike Watkins.",

    "webTitle": "Airbus's ingenious Bombardier plan is comeuppance for Boeing", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Comeuppance for a corporate bully rarely arrives so swiftly or so elegantly. Boeing attempted to kill Bombardier\u2019s C-Series plane in its infancy by getting US trade authorities to impose stiff import tariffs. Now those heavy-handed legal tactics have produced an outcome that could be damaging in the long-term for Boeing. Arch-rival Airbus has swooped from the wings to grab majority control of the C-Series and proclaim that the 300% tariffs can be side-stepped via the simple remedy of conducting the final assembly of planes destined for US customers in Alabama. If Airbus\u2019s plan works, it\u2019s ingenious. It will get a 50.1% stake in the C-Series without paying a penny and will collect some cheap warrants on Bombardier\u2019s shares. Bombardier wins in the sense that it now has a partner with the financial muscle and supply chains to make a success of the C-Series. True, the Canadian firm has to accept that its stake in the C-Series will be diluted from 62% to 31%, but it can console itself that something is better than nothing, which was the likely alternative. Finally, production jobs on the C-Series programme \u2013 including 1,000 at the Bombardier factory in Belfast \u2013 should be better protected. Is Airbus\u2019s manoeuvre too clever by half? That was gist of Boeing\u2019s predictable grumble. \u201cThis looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidised competitors to skirt the recent findings of the US government,\u201d it said. We\u2019ll ignore the absurdity of Boeing complaining about subsidies and wait to see how its complaint plays out. Until clarity arrives, the GMB union representing workers in Belfast is right to caution that it hopes Airbus\u2019s legal advice is solid. But, on the face of it, it\u2019s hard to see why US trade rules would stop a plane being assembled in the US for the use of US airlines. If, as Airbus and Bombardier hope, the C-Series and some politically-sensitive jobs have been saved, Theresa May may wish to reflect on one moral of the tale. Her personal appeals to a protectionist US president got nowhere. It was Airbus, supposedly a lumbering exercise in pan-European co-operation, that knew how to play the game. Carney seems settled on rate rise It is now odds-on that interest rates will rise on 2 November for the first time since 2007. Inflation, on the CPI measure, stood at 3% in September and Bank of England governor Mark Carney expects it to go higher. Indeed, when giving evidence to the Treasury select committee, Carney sounded like a man whose mind is settled. The inflationary effects of last year\u2019s post-referendum fall in sterling will take three years to work their way through the economy, he argued. That is starting to sound like the majority view. Economists at Barclays reckon there is just one dove left on the nine-strong rate-setting committee \u2013 David Ramsden, one of the two new members. There are two ways to view the Bank\u2019s approach to this point. A generous interpretation says Carney &amp; co have skilfully prepared the ground. The market, which only a few months ago was expecting rates to remain at 0.25% until the end of next year, has been given time to adjust to the new thinking. An alternative view says the Bank has boxed itself into a corner unnecessarily. By talking up the prospect of a rate-rise, the Bank has to deliver in a fortnight\u2019s time or lose its credibility and risk another sharp reverse in the value of sterling, which would squeeze real incomes at a bad moment. There was a better way. The August 2016 cut to 0.25% should have been reversed at the start of this year when the post-referendum slump failed to materialise. That would have avoided the current mini-drama over what is, after all, a modest tweak to monetary policy. Rollercoaster for Merlin Entertainments shares Merlin Entertainments used to argue that its theme parks and attractions, such as the London Eye, Legoland and Gardaland in Italy, were so popular that terrorist attacks in the UK and the rest of Europe only had a temporary effect on visitor numbers. It\u2019s telling a different story now. Terrorism \u201cat record levels of intensity in Europe\u201d has produced \u201cdifficult\u201d trading conditions. Shares slumped 16%. Yet the market\u2019s reaction looks odd. Merlin didn\u2019t actually move its profit forecasts very far. Top-line profits of \u00a3489m for 2017 had been expected but the company says \u00a3470m-\u00a3480m is now more likely. The slight difference doesn\u2019t obviously justify a double-digit reaction in the share price, especially as securing a licence to open Peppa Pig attractions outside the UK looks a smart piece of business. Parents will probably hate the things, but that\u2019s another story.",

The statement piece, designed by the jeweller Robert Mouawad, is handcrafted from 18-karat gold and covered with more than 4,500 diamonds.

    "webTitle": "UK Treasury rejects OECD's call for second Brexit referendum", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Treasury has flatly rejected calls for a second EU referendum after the west\u2019s leading economic thinktank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said reversing the decision to leave would significantly benefit the economy. \u201cWe are leaving the EU and there will not be a second referendum,\u201d the Treasury said in a terse statement that reflected the government\u2019s unhappiness with the OECD\u2019s intervention. The Paris-based group, which has 35 of the world\u2019s richest countries as members, said it would revise the gloomy forecasts it made in its annual health check were Britain to stay in the EU. \u201cIn case Brexit gets reversed by political decision (change of majority, new referendum, etc), the positive impact on growth would be significant,\u201d the report said. No 10 joined the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in rejecting the OECD\u2019s analysis, though a spokeswoman for the prime minister would not be drawn on whether the statement was irresponsible or on whether the UK\u2019s \u00a310m-a-year membership contribution to the thinktank was well spent. \u201cThe OECD are a respected international body but what we should bear in mind is that it\u2019s based on a no-deal situation, which is not what we are looking for. We are confident we are going to strike a good deal,\u201d she said. Leave campaigners were more critical of the OECD, which receives most of its funds from other EU member states. The Change Britain chair and former Labour MP Gisela Stuart said: \u201cIt is laughable that the EU-funded OECD, at a time that is the most helpful possible for Brussels, has the gall to intervene in our negotiations and call for Brexit to be reversed. \u201cThese EU elites refuse to accept that 17.4 million people voted to take back control, and meant it. The British public didn\u2019t believe the OECD\u2019s scaremongering before, and nor should they start now.\u201d Angel Gurr\u00eda, the OECD\u2019s secretary general, insisted that the thinktank respected the decision of the referendum and sources at the organisation sought to play down the \u201csecond referendum\u201d call, saying it was merely sketching out alternative scenarios. However, the OECD said Britain must secure \u201cthe closest possible economic relationship\u201d with the EU after Brexit to prevent the economy suffering a long-term decline. Gurr\u00eda said Brexit would be as harmful as the second world war blitz and the British would need to act on the propaganda maxim to keep calm and carry on. The deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats said it was clear from the OECD report that a second vote was needed to prevent the harm caused by Brexit. Jo Swinson said: \u201cBrexit has already caused the UK to slip from top to bottom of the international growth league for major economies. \u201cThis will only get worse if the government succeeds in dragging us out of the single market and customs union, or we end up crashing out of Europe without a deal.\u201d The thinktank, which has predicted the UK\u2019s growth rate will fall to 1% next year, said a \u201cdisorderly\u201d exit from the EU single market and customs union in 2019 would hurt trading relationships and reduce long-term growth. Entering the debate over Brexit at a crucial stage in negotiations, the OECD added that steep falls in the UK\u2019s productivity performance relative to other major economies, allied with the failure of its export industries to grab a slice of expanding world trade, have left the country in a weak position to operate outside the EU. The warning follows a week of shuttle diplomacy between London and Brussels. The UK government says it has gained a commitment from EU leaders to speed up talks, although there has been no progress in crucial areas, including the divorce bill. Officials at the OECD have adopted one of the gloomiest outlooks for the British economy with an assumption that a trade deal with the EU would take four years to negotiate after Brexit, leading to further uncertainty and lower growth. To offset some of the damage, the OECD urged Hammond to spend spare funds on identifying ways to improve productivity, which measures the output per hour of an individual worker, by enhancing the skills of low-income workers. On the possibility that the UK might change course altogether, it said: \u201cIn case Brexit gets reversed by political decision (change of majority, new referendum, etc), the positive impact on growth would be significant.\u201d The report also called on the chancellor to revive his plans to raise funds through an increase income tax on the self-employed, and end the triple lock on state pension rises, arguing that the state pension should rise in line with average earnings. Both proposals were immediately slapped down by Hammond, who said there was no intention to revisit the self-employment pension increases, which would continue to be in line with the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5%. But the OECD reserved a warning for the Bank of England, which it said must guard against raising interest rates during a period of low growth, declining rates of productivity and while the economy remained vulnerable to Brexit. It said Threadneedle Street should \u201clook through\u201d the current spike in inflation and maintain a loose monetary policy. The Treasury said: \u201cIncreasing productivity is a key priority for this government, so that we can build on our record employment levels and improve people\u2019s quality of life. \u201cToday, the OECD has recognised the importance of our \u00a323bn national productivity investment fund, which will improve our country\u2019s infrastructure, increase research and development and build more houses. \u201cIn addition, our reforms to technical education and our ambitious industrial strategy will also help to deliver an economy that works for everyone.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Treasury has flatly rejected calls for a second EU referendum after the west\u2019s leading economic thinktank, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, said reversing the decision to leave would significantly benefit the economy.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are leaving the EU and there will not be a second referendum,\u201d the Treasury said in a terse statement that reflected the government\u2019s unhappiness with the OECD\u2019s intervention.<br></p> \n<p>The Paris-based group, which has 35 of the world\u2019s richest countries as members, said it would revise the gloomy forecasts it made in its annual health check were Britain to stay in the EU.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn case Brexit gets reversed by political decision (change of majority, new referendum, etc), the positive impact on growth would be significant,\u201d the report said.</p> \n<p>No 10 joined the chancellor, Philip Hammond, in rejecting the OECD\u2019s analysis, though a spokeswoman for the prime minister would not be drawn on whether the statement was irresponsible or on whether the UK\u2019s \u00a310m-a-year membership contribution to the thinktank was well spent. </p> \n<p>\u201cThe OECD are a respected international body but what we should bear in mind is that it\u2019s based on a no-deal situation, which is not what we are looking for.

      "bodyText": "A down day for equities, with European markets mostly finishing lower. After edging towards another closing high, the FTSE 100 finally ended in the red despite a dip in the pound. Sterling suffered on continuing Brexit fears and following dovish comments from members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee. Elsewhere the main markets took a breather although Spain bucked the trend, with the Ibex recovering from its recent weakness in the wake of the row over Catalan independence. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 10.80 points or 0.14% at 7516.17 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.07% to 12,995.06 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.03% at 5361.37 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 0.4% to 22,337.78 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended up 0.35% at 10,216.8 In Greece, the Athens market lost 0.51% to 761.82 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average, having briefly moved above 23,000, is currently up 0.09% at 22,976. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The Dow above 23,000 was short-lived, for the moment at least. It is still up, but just 0.08% at 22,976. Commenting on the day\u2019s rising stock markets, Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: Global stocks have enjoyed another day of gains, with the now customary record highs in US indices this time driven by an outperformance in the banking sector. The dollar strengthened, with European currencies losing ground amid uncertainty fueled by Catalonia and Brexit. With the yen and gold losing ground, there is a clear shift into risk assets to the detriment of perceived havens. The latest US earnings season is underway, and US financials are heading higher in the wake of impressive figures from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. ..the impressive overall profitability in US banking does help instill confidence in an environment of rising rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has crossed 23,000 for the first time, as the surge in stock markets continues. The move comes not long after it breached the 22,000 barrier on 2 August. The comments from the Bank of England outweighed strong inflation figures as far as the pound is concerned, says Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex: Rate hike uncertainty spoiled what could have been an incredibly hawkish day for the pound, given that inflation hit a 5 year high of 3.0% in September. The Bank of England ended up distracting sterling from that alarmingly high CPI reading. New deputy governor Dave Ramsden was pretty dovish this morning, and while his MPC peer Silvana Tenreyro was slightly more open to a rate hike, she said any move is \u2018very contingent on the data\u2019 (which, at the moment, isn\u2019t a great sign for sterling). BoE chief Mark Carney arguably dealt the biggest blow to the pound. Though the central bank head honcho said the MPC thinks a hike may be appropriate \u2018in the coming months\u2019, that comment potentially pushes the pulling of the interest rate trigger beyond the Bank of England\u2019s next meeting in early November. That wasn\u2019t all. Carney warned on the negative impact a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit would have on the economy, while stating that businesses are \u2018less confident about a smooth transition\u2019. The OECD also got involved, claiming a \u2018disorderly\u2019 Brexit would reduce Britain\u2019s \u2018long-term growth\u2019. Combine that with the prospect of some miserable wage growth and retail sales figures on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, and some decent import prices and industrial production data from the US, and cable had a truly dreadful afternoon. The pound fell 0.7% against the dollar, sending it back towards $1.31; sterling fared a bit better against the euro, and even then it slipped 0.3%. The FTSE couldn\u2019t squeeze too much growth out of this situation, with the UK index still stuck below 7550, a level its struggled to break for the past week. Here\u2019s a chart from ING Bank showing UK inflation excluding the movements in the pound and oil price: Back with the pound: The outlook for US manufacturing looks upbeat even if the recent hurricanes have a negative effect on the short term figures, reckons James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank. Following the industrial production figures, he said: US Industrial production rose 0.3% month on month, in line with expectations. A two-tenths upward revision to August was also announced (-0.7% versus -0.9% originally reported). The details show that manufacturing output rose 0.1% month on month, utilities grew 1.5% month on month while mining was up 0.4% month on month. The Federal Reserve had suggested in advance of the report\u2019s publication that the data would be liable to revision given a lack of information on which operations were back up and running after Hurricane Harvey while Hurricane Irma will have had a depressing effect on figures from Florida. Nonetheless, the outlook remains positive with manufacturing set to strengthen in coming months. The domestic story is encouraging with the ISM manufacturing headline figure at a 13 year high while the softer dollar (relative to last year) and strengthening foreign demand should support exports. Meanwhile, mining output should gradually move higher given rising oil prices and rig counts. Consequently, we look for the sector to make a meaningful contribution to fourth quarter GDP even if it has disappointed in third quarter through the hit from the storms. Over in the US, industrial production for September has edged up in line with forecasts. It rose 0.3% compared to a decline of 0.7% in August, itself revised up from an initial 0.9% fall. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added around 15 points or 0.07% in early trading to a new record high. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.5 points at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 3.44 points. The uncertain start came despite reasonable results from investment banking giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The pound is down around 0.5%, partly on the downbeat Brexit comments from the OECD and Bank of England governor Mark Carney. It has also been affected by Carney saying interest rates would rise in the months ahead, which was taken to mean not necessarily in November as expected, as well as dovish remarks from other members of the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. The fall in sterling has given a lift to the FTSE 100, which has a large number of exporters who benefit from a weaker pound. The leading index is currently up 20 points or 0.28%. Time for a quick recap. Britain\u2019s inflation rate has hit a new five-year high, taking another bite out of wages and bringing more pain for those relying on government benefits. The Consumer Prices Index rose by 3.0% in the 12 months to September, the highest level since early 2012. Food and transport costs were important factors behind the rise, which economists are blaming on the weak pound driving up import costs. The figures mean that the state pension is on track to rise by 3% next year, under the \u2018triple-lock\u2019 policy. It also means that real wages have continued to fall -- average earnings only rose by 2.1% in the three months to July; new labour market figures due tomorrow are unlikely to show much improvement. Bank of England governor Mark Carney predicted that inflation will probably rise higher in the next couple of months, before dipping back. Testifying to the Treasury committee, Carney warned that European states have not done as much work as the UK on the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without a deal. He also told MPs that firms are losing confidence that Brexit will proceed smoothly to a new trading arrangement. Carney also argued forcefully that a transition period, of at least two years, would help resolve issues such as Britain\u2019s massive derivatives market. The rise in inflation could spur the Bank of England to raise interest rates next month. But some City experts warn that this would harm the economy, and do little to bring down import prices. Lukman Otunuga, Research Analyst at FXTM, says Mark Carney et al have a difficult decision: This has been a tricky year for the central bank, especially when considering how elevated inflation levels have squeezed household spending - impacting the outlook for the economy. With inflation leaving average earnings in the dust, consumers are feeling the pinch and as such, it threatens the sustainability of Britain\u2019s consumer-driven growth. While the argument for higher rates is to put a lid on inflation, this may end up punishing the fragile UK economy. Union leaders have urged the government to raise public sector wages, which would help nurses, teachers, police officers et al to handle inflation. Liberal Democrat Leader Vince Cable agrees, saying: \u201cThe Brexit squeeze caused by the falling pound is getting worse, and it is hitting the poorest families hardest. \u201cThis above-target inflation is increasing the cost of the weekly shop and cutting into people\u2019s living standards. \u201cThe Chancellor must end the benefits freeze that is set to leave millions of families hundreds of pounds poorer a year. Above all, the government must change course from a destructive Brexit that would damage living standards and push up prices further.\u201d Here\u2019s a clip of Mark Carney today, warning that inflation will probably rise further in October or November: And finally, governor Carney is asked about the Bank of England\u2019s gender pay gap. He says Bank is planning to publish details next month. But he\u2019s happy to give some top lines now. Namely... The median gender pay gap is 24% The mean pay gap is 21%. But, on an equal work for equal pay assessment, there is no gender pay gap. The gaps exists because there are more men at the top of the Bank than lower down the ranks, who are paid more. Carney insists the Bank is committed to improving diversity. He cites \u2018blind\u2019 recruitment panels, spreading the recruitment net beyond economists, hiring from 40 universities (up from just 10). If you start from a position of being almost exclusively a white male institution, you need to have a deliberate strategy of movement. In the end, the Bank expects to be in the \u201cmiddle of the pack\u201d for the financial services industry on gender, but near the top for the public sector. And that\u2019s the end of the session. Back in the Thatcher Room, Mark Carney is invited to dwell on the benefits of Brexit.... The governor cited a few, including: The opportunity to negotiate trade deals focused on UK interests Tailoring regulations to focus on the specifics of the UK economy. The opportunity to step back and look at a host of wider issues, such as fiscal policy, the labour market, education policy. But, Parliament will have to decide the balance of those opportunities versus striking a transition deal and a new arrangement with the EU. Carney denies that the Bank\u2019s quantitative easing programme, which has bought \u00a3425bn of bonds with newly created money, is the monetary equivalent of heroin. Breaking away from Mark Carney (and inflation), the Treasury has slapped down the OECD after it suggested that Britain could stay in the European Union. The Paris-based think tank argued this morning that Britain\u2019s economy would get a boost if it chose not to follow through with Brexit. In its annual assessment of the UK, the OECD predicted that growth would slow in 2018 year and business investment fall. It also warned that a hard Brexit would \u201cwould hurt trading relationships and reduce long-term growth\u201d. But there would be a \u201csignificant\u201d boost if the Brexit vote was reversed, perhaps through a second referendum, it suggested. In response, the Treasury has insisted that the public won\u2019t get a chance to change last June\u2019s referendum result: \u2018We are working to achieve the best deal with the EU that protects jobs and the economy. We aim to agree a Free Trade Agreement that is comprehensive and ambitious. Our \u00a323 billion National Productivity Investment Fund which will improve our country\u2019s infrastructure, increase research and development and build more houses. We are leaving the EU and there will not be a second referendum.\u2019 The OECD\u2019s report was presented to the press in London this morning, but chancellor Philip Hammond didn\u2019t hang around long enough to take questions.... Q: Should fiscal policy be taking more of the strain to help the UK economy? Unsurprisingly, Mark Carney won\u2019t be lured into commenting on tax and spending policies. We take fiscal policy as given, he insists, it\u2019s not for us to advise the government. And on house prices, he says the housing market faces \u201cstructural problems\u201d (ie, we\u2019re not building enough new homes) but argues that prices aren\u2019t in a bubble (reminder, they rose by 5% per year in August). He says the government\u2019s Help to Buy hasn\u2019t had a major impact on the market, either in terms of prices or stimulating a lot of new builds. The pound has dropped by half a cent against the US dollar since Mark Carney\u2019s testimony began. Sterling may be suffering from the governor\u2019s warnings about a no-deal Brexit Q: Does the Bank of England have a clue about why UK productivity is so weak? Carney says he does have a clue yes...and after more prodding from the committee he cites weak business investment and the wider impact of economic uncertainty. Q: The UK\u2019s debt burden is growing, thanks to consumer credit products such as PCPs used to buy new cars. When will the bubble blow up? Carney argues that auto finance is not as serious as some claim. If someone walks away from a PCP plan then the debt falls on the car vendor - or in many cases the manufacturer of the car. He says banks are well-capitalised to handle a rise in bad debts. Q: When must a transition deal be agreed, before firms take matters into their own hands and trigger their contingency plans? Carney won\u2019t commit to a fixed date, but says the issue is particularly urgent for the City. Q: How have businesses and consumers\u2019 attitude to Brexit changed? Mark Carney indicates that UK firms have become \u201cless confident about a smooth transition\u201d and less confident about the end state of Brexit. Households are less worried, he says, At present, household expectations are broadly consistent with a smooth outcome to a future arrangement. But consumer confidence has fallen, partly due to lower real incomes (due to rising inflation). Carney adds that financial markets are the most concerned - they have already priced in a significant adjustment to the UK\u2019s future prospects, and they may have to \u2018mark up\u2019 the UK\u2019s future performance [if Brexit goes better than some fear]. Q: What preparations are you making for Brexit? Carney says the Bank of England has looked at worse-case scenarios, and what we can do to mitigate those risks. That includes making sure that banks are sufficiently capitalised to handle a very bad outcome. On the upside, the Bank could raise its growth forecasts if Britain agrees a \u201cfull, comprehensive, ambitious arrangement\u201d with the rest of the EU. The Treasury committee are probing Mark Carney about how the trillions worth of derivatives contracts between the UK and other EU country members will be handled after Brexit. Mark Carney says this cannot be resolved if Britain crashes out without a deal. Q: Is a two-year transition period enough to resolve this problem? Carney says that the best solution would be legislation that would \u201cgrandfather those contracts\u201d, so that they could continue to be honoured after Brexit. He also cites cross-border insurance (European companies and individuals who have taken out insurance from UK entities) and cross-border data concerns. And...he repeats his argument that a hard Brexit would hurt Europe more than the UK on these issues. There\u2019s more data that is relevant to the EU in the UK than vice versa... These issues are bigger for Europe than they are for us, but they\u2019re material for us. Bang on cue, Mark Carney argues that a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit poses a threat to Europe\u2019s financial stability. He tells the Treasury committee that Europe would be \u2018short of financial services capacity\u2019 in the short term, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal. The entire economic impacts are greater for the UK, he says, but the financial stability impact is greater for the EU in the short term. Breaking: Britain faces long-term decline unless it secures \u201cthe closest possible economic relationship\u201d with the European Union after Brexit. That\u2019s according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD), in its annual healthcheck on the UK economy. More here: Carney argues that Britain and the EU will agree a transition deal, as avoiding a hard Brexit will be in everyone\u2019s interests. Carney is asked about concerns that some banks aren\u2019t ready for Britain\u2019s departure from the EU in 2019. He replies that European-based institutions have done much less preparation than UK banks for the possibility of a hard exit from the EU without any transition deal. So we\u2019re doing all those preparations for that. There has been much less of that done in the European Union, including by the member firms. Q: What would happen if the City of London\u2019s euro clearing market moved abroad after Brexit? Carney warns that Europe\u2019s real economy would suffer higher costs if the euro clearing market was fragmented [currently, trillions of pounds, euros, dollars and yen-based derivatives contracts are settled in London, under a system of clearing houses set up to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis] Q: So are you lobbying behind the scenes for talks on this issue to begin soon? Carney says the Bank of England would like the UK to have the go-ahead to start talks, with the BoE\u2019s assistance when needed. And he insists that breaking up the derivatives market would mean that European car makers and pension funds, for example, would pay more for financial transactions. Carney also points out that the Bank of England is already trying to stimulate the economy: Q: With interest rates at just 0.25%, the UK doesn\u2019t have much room to cut if there is a recession. Wouldn\u2019t it be wise to raise borrowing costs to give the Bank more ammunition when needed? Carney isn\u2019t at all convinced that this is a good idea. He explains to the committee that the Bank\u2019s job is to keep inflation at 2% in the medium term. Raising rates today so you can cut them tomorrow wouldn\u2019t really fit with that remit. As Carney puts it: Building a war chest in interest rate terms for a potential future shock, isn\u2019t staying on point in terms of the inflation target, nor is it appropriate or necessary given that policy can move quite nimbly if required. Q: Are you concerned that the UK\u2019s net international investment position has been revised down by \u00a3490bn (as reported by the Daily Telegraph yesterday)? Carney says that the stock of UK assets, as opposed to the flows, is quite healthy. He points out that Britain still owns a lot of assets in the rest of the world (but not as much as previously thought). And the fall in the pound actually improves that position. The UK owes a lot in sterling, and owns a lot in foreign currency assets. With the depreciation [of the pound] you get a positive move. Carney also warns that the \u201csustainable level\u201d for Britain\u2019s current account deficit (which is running a hefty deficit) will ultimately depend on the future trade relationship with Europe. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is testifying to the Treasury Committee now. It\u2019s being streamed live, here. Q: Inflation has risen to 3% - only 0.1% away from the level when you must write a letter to the chancellor explaining why you have missed your target. Do you expect to write a letter soon? Carney says it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will write to Philip Hammond in the next few months to explain why inflation is more than one percentage point away from 2%. He says the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote means inflation is likely to rise over 3% \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. He reminds the committee that the Bank of England signalled prior to the referendum that the pound would be hit by a vote to leave the EU. We expected sterling to fall sharply. It did. That passes through to prices.... The sole reason that inflation has gone up as much as it has is the depreciation of sterling. Guardian Business has launched a daily email. Besides the key news headlines that you\u2019d expect, there\u2019s an at-a-glance agenda of the day\u2019s main events, insightful opinion pieces and a quality feature to sink your teeth into each day. For your morning shot of financial news, sign up here: Here\u2019s our economics editor, Larry Elliott, on today\u2019s inflation report: Britain\u2019s pensioners will receive a 3% increase in their state income next year after the annual inflation rate reached its highest level since early 2012 last month. The 12-month increase in the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) edged up from 2.9% to 3% - in line with recent Bank of England forecasts. Any further increase would force Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to write a letter to the chancellor, Philip Hammond explaining why inflation was not being kept to its 2% target. The City expects the Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee to raise interest rates next month for the first time in more than a decade. Inflation has risen from 1% to 3% over the past year, largely due to the fall in the value of the pound, which has made imports dearer. The Office for National Statistics said the cost of fuel and raw materials for industry were up by 8.4% on a year ago compared with a 7.6% increase in the 12 months to August. It said more expensive food and a smaller fall in air fares than a year ago were the main factors explaining higher inflation, although clothes had come down in price. The pick-up in inflation means the state pension will rise by at least 3% next year because the so-called triple lock means it rises by the September inflation rate, the September increase in annual earnings or 2.5%. Annual earnings are currently rising by just over 2%. More here: Back in parliament, new Bank of England policymaker Silvana Tenreyro has been quizzed by the Treasury committee. Tenreyro told MPs that she could vote for an interest rate rise in the coming months, but only if the data justified it. She said evidence from US studies of interest rate hikes and cuts showed that a premature move to increase the cost of borrowing \u201ccan be costly\u201d. [Studies show that] if it turns out to be a mistake it will require a lot more cuts in the future in order to recover that lost ground\u201d Tenreyo is among the majority of MPC members who would vote for a rate hike in the coming months, as articulated at their last meeting in September. But she may hold back from voting to raise rates if the data paints a weaker picture of the economy. \u201cMy position now is that if the data outturns are consistent with the picture i\u2019ve just described, of an output gap going towards zero, then i would be minded to vote for a bank rate increase in the coming months. However that\u2019s very contingent, and i should be clear, on the data outturns. If the data undershoots and the data are not in line with those expectations then i will wait until i see further evidence of that output gap being eroded.\u201d Tenreyo also thinks the UK is some way from removing its package of quantitative easing support for the economy. \u201cWe are still far from that point at which we will start unwinding given that the bank rate is so low.\u201d Tenreyro also told MPs that her experience growing up in Argentina would be valuable. That raised some eyebrows..... hopefully the UK won\u2019t be turning to the IMF anytime soon..... Labour MP Angela Rayner tweets: The well-respected Institute for Fiscal Studies makes in important point. The rise in inflation means the government\u2019s policy of freezing benefits is causing more pain than anticipated. Paul Johnson, head of the IFS, says the whole policy is discredited. Could Philip Hammond make changes in next month\u2019s budget? It\u2019s possible, but the problem is that letting benefits rise in line with inflation would cost money. And the chancellor doesn\u2019t have much of a war chest to play with... In other news, UK house price inflation has picked up -- but not in London. Average house prices in the UK rose by 5.0% in the year to August 2017, up from 4.5% in July 2017. However, prices in the capital actually fell during the month, and are only 2.4% higher than a year ago. That might help some younger people to get onto the housing market (although the average London house price is still \u00a3484,000). Richard Snook, senior economist at PwC, points out that prices in the financial district have taken a serious knock. The uncertainty over Brexit may be felt more keenly in London than other areas due to the importance of international businesses. Figures from the City of London borough bear this out where prices are down 18.4% compared to a year ago. Amit Kara of the NIESR thinktank warns that UK inflation could keep rising in the next few months: Newsflash: The Bank of England\u2019s newest deputy governor has revealed that he isn\u2019t one of the policymakers who believe interest rates need to rise soon. Sir Dave Ramsden has told the Treasury Committee that he wasn\u2019t among the majority at last month\u2019s meeting who said that they were close to voting for a hike. Instead, Ramsden took the view that the UK economy was ready for higher borrowing costs. The majority of MPC members saw a case for removing some of the monetary stimulus in the coming months. I wasn\u2019t in that majority. This was my first ever MPC member as a voter. I wasn\u2019t in a position where I was part of that majority that thought - the way the degree of slack was diminishing, the way trade off between slack and higher inflation was disappearing - was sufficient to give that signal. Scotiabank also blame the weak pound for driving inflation up: It\u2019s clear that the slump in the pound after last year\u2019s EU referendum is the main factor driving UK inflation up. These charts show how the cost of goods has spiked over the last year. Britain is a net importer of actual stuff, so a weaker pound means it\u2019s simply more expensive to bring raw materials and finished products into the country. In contrast, the eurozone\u2019s inflation rate was just 1.5% in September, meaning most Europeans should be enjoying real wage rises. Open Britain, the campaign group against a Hard Brexit, argues that Britain can\u2019t afford to lose full access to the Single Market. Nick Dixon, investment director at Aegon, fears that the pound could suffer fresh losses if Britain and Brussels don\u2019t achieve progress in the Brexit taslks. While there are signs of a slowing economy, with sterling still at risk as Brexit negotiations remain inconclusive the British economy remains vulnerable to further inflationary forces. UNISON, the public sector union, argues that the government needs to produce a \u2018decent pay rise\u2019 to make up for years of austerity. General secretary Dave Prentis says: \u201cThere\u2019s no light at the end of the tunnel for public service workers. Unfunded, below-inflation pay awards are apparently the best the government has to offer. \u201cAll public servants have seen the value of their pay fall year on year. They need a decent pay rise that more than matches the rising cost of living.\u201d The Treasury has responded to today\u2019s inflation figures, arguing that the government is helping where it can... \u201cWe understand that families are feeling the effects of inflation and we are helping them with their living costs. We\u2019ve frozen fuel duty, doubled free childcare for nearly 400,000 working parents and cut income tax for 30 million people. Increases to the National Living Wage are also delivering the fastest pay rise for the lowest paid in 20 years.\u201d. The Resolution Foundation points out that UK welfare benefits are NOT rising in line with inflation (unlike pensions...). This means that the poorest in our communities will find it even harder to get by next year, even if they are in work. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, warns that rising inflation will eat into our Christmas budgets: \u201cWe\u2019re now starting to feel the real impact of Brexit on our wallets. With inflation at a five-year high there\u2019s no escaping the fact that the luxury of low inflation is well and truly over with prices of goods and services rising left right and centre and the shiny new pounds in our pockets will unfortunately buy you less. \u201cYour household budget will be stretched as the cost of transport is creeping up and the price of fuel and food is also on the up. The cost of your supermarket shop is rising too so you must act now to protect yourself from future struggles. \u201cPrices are rising faster than earnings and we are heading into one of the most expensive times of year \u2013 Christmas, so budgeting is key.\u201d Britain\u2019s pensioners are the big winners from today\u2019s inflation report, thanks to the triple-lock that guarantees that their pensions won\u2019t lag behind prices. So argues Maike Currie, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International. She writes: \u201cLife is getting much more expensive with an increase in the cost of food, fuel and a last-minute price spike in flights all contributing to the rise in inflation. Meanwhile, our pay packets have stagnated with wage growth falling behind inflation, despite UK unemployment being at a record low. \u201cIt\u2019s also worth noting that September\u2019s inflation figure matters hugely to both retirees and savers. Under the government\u2019s \u2018triple lock\u2019 guarantee, the state pension will rise in April each year by whichever number is the highest out of the September CPI inflation number, average earnings or 2.5%. With inflation running higher than either wages or 2.5%, this will be determine the rise in the State Pension next year, arguably making retirees the biggest winners from today\u2019s inflation figure. The Federation of Small Businesses is aghast that its members face a 3.9% increase in business rates next year, thanks to today\u2019s RPI inflation report (details here) Mike Cherry, the FSB\u2019s national chairman, says UK firms have suffered enough, following the controversial revaluation process that send some bills spiralling higher. Today\u2019s RPI figure follows six months of business rates misery for our small business community. Since April\u2019s bruising revaluation we\u2019ve had the staircase tax, introduction of an unworkable appeals platform and chronic delays to the Chancellor\u2019s \u00a3435 million relief package. A near four per cent bill increase next April, on top of losing year one transitional caps, will be the last straw for many. The TUC, which represents millions of British workers, says the government needs to respond to the ongoing wage squeeze that is hurting UK households. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201cThe government needs to face up to Britain\u2019s cost of living crisis. The squeeze on household budgets is getting tighter by the month. \u201cThe Chancellor must use November\u2019s Budget to ease the pressure on hard-pressed families. \u201cThat means giving five million public sector workers the pay rise they have earned. \u201cPrices are sky-rocketing. Offering hard-working public servants below-inflation increases would amount to yet another real-terms pay cut.\u201d She also argues that the Bank of England should not raise interest rates from their current alltime low of 0.25% \u201cRaising interest rates now would be a big mistake. The UK economy is simply not strong enough. \u201cWe need to get wages rising before we start think about hiking rates.\u201d This is one of the most depressing charts in UK economics today -- showing how UK workers\u2019 pay packets are shrinking in real terms. As you can see, its the second wage squeeze in a decade. The retail prices index, another measure of inflation, rose by 3.9% in September. That means that UK firms face a 3.9% rise in their business rates next year, under the current system. It could also drive up costs for motorists. Rising food prices helped to drive UK inflation to a five-year high of 3.0% in September. The Office for National Statistics says: The rate of 2.6% for recreation and culture is the highest since January 2010, whilst the rate of 3.1% for food and non-alcoholic beverages is the highest since October 2013.... Housing and household services costs were the biggest single factor driving the cost of living up, the ONS adds, partly due to utility bills. This chart shows how UK inflation has risen sharply, to its highest level since April 2012 Breaking! Britain\u2019s inflation rate has hit a new five and a half-year high. The consumer prices index jumped by 3.0% in September, up from August\u2019s 2.9%. That\u2019s the highest reading since early 2012. This means that British workers are still suffering a pay squeeze, as average wages only rose by 2.1% per year in the three months to July. But I think it\u2019s better news for pensioners, who can look forward to a 3% increase in the basic state pension next April. Under the triple-lock system, pensions rise in line with earnings growth, September\u2019s CPI reading, or by 2.5%, whichever number is biggest. More to follow! A reminder of why today\u2019s inflation reading is particularly important: Analysts at HSBC reckon the UK\u2019s inflation rate jumped to 3.1% last month: Yikes! Shares in entertainment group Merlin have slumped by 20% in early trading. Merlin has shocked the City by warning it suffered \u201cdifficult trading conditions\u201d over the summer. The company, which runs Alton Towers, Madame Tussauds and the London Eye, said terrorism was partly to blame: The spate of terror attacks witnessed in the UK marked an inflection point in Midway London and UK theme park trading. Poor weather in Northern Europe and extreme weather in Italy and Florida also impacted peak season trading. Economist Rupert Seggins has tweeted some handy graphs on UK inflation, ahead of this morning\u2019s data in 30 minutes time. This one shows how inflation typically tracks moves in the value of the pound (but roughly two years later) This chart shows how the oil price influences the cost of living: Sterling is inching higher this morning, as City traders anticipate UK inflation hitting its highest levels since 2012. The pound has gained almost half a eurocent against the euro, to \u20ac1.2175. It\u2019s also up a more modest 0.1% against the US dollar, at $1.3263. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: Despite last night\u2019s meeting between Theresa May and Jean Claude Juncker (and David Davis and Michel Barnier) producing nothing more than vague promise to \u2018accelerate\u2019 negotiations, the pound is on the rise this Tuesday. That\u2019s because investors are eagerly awaiting September\u2019s inflation reading, which is set to see the consumer price index finally hit a 5 year high of 3.0%. Such a reading would put even more pressure on the Bank of England to raise rates, though that hawkish urge may be tempered by the continued fall in real wages (set to be confirmed tomorrow) and a sharp month-on-month drop in retail sales (coming on Thursday). Two years ago, CPI inflation was actually negative, at -0.1%. That was partly to falling oil prices, which delivered cheaper petrol, and price wars between UK supermarkets. But, as this chart shows, the inflation rate inched higher in late 2015 and early 2016 - and then accelerated sharply once the pound slumped after the Brexit vote. Higher petrol prices and utility bills probably drove UK inflation up in September. Airline ticket prices could also push the consumer prices index up to 3%. That\u2019s partly Ryanair\u2019s fault; customers scrambled to buy new flights after it cancelled thousands of trips last month. Food, clothing and footwear are all \u2018wild cards\u2019 that could push inflation over 3%, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Britain\u2019s inflation rate could hit a new five-year high this morning, hitting people in the pocket and putting more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates in November. City economists predict that inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, jumped to 3.0% in September. That would be an increase on August\u2019s 2.9%, and the highest level since spring 2012. If so, this would be the latest proof that the fall in the pound since last year\u2019s Brexit vote is pushing up prices and hurting households and businesses. It would also mean that prices are rising faster than earnings. The average pay packet only grew by 2.1% over the last year, meaning that real wages are falling. Finn McLaughlin of Capital Economics says: We expect that CPI inflation (09.30 BST) rose from 2.9% in August to 3% in September, intensifying the real wage squeeze. That said, we suspect inflation is now not far from its eventual peak. We think that it will rise to about 3.2% before year-end. Today\u2019s inflation figures are particularly important as they\u2019ll be used to set next year\u2019s pensions rises (under the UK\u2019s \u2018triple lock\u2019, pensions rise in line with wages, prices, or 2.5% - whichever is higher). The retail prices index, another measure of inflation, will be used to set next year\u2019s business rates. It is expected to rise to 4% today, which would mean a 4% rise in business rates for UK firms. If CPI rises by 3.1% or more, then the Bank of England will have to write to the government explaining why it\u2019s not keeping inflation close to its 2% target. With excellent timing, BoE governor Mark Carney and colleagues are testifying to MPs on the Treasury this morning, so we\u2019ll see what they say about inflation, Brexit, and the state of the economy. Also coming up today: The row between aircraft makers Boeing and Bombardier has taken a dramatic turn overnight; Airbus, the European consortium, is taking a controlling stake in Bombardier\u2019s C Series business. That division, which employs thousands in Northern Ireland, was hit with US tariffs totalling 300% last month following a complaint from Boeing. Could this deal protect jobs? We\u2019ll bring you more details as they come in Theme park operator Merlin Entertainment, online fashion retailer ASOS and model toy maker Hornby are all reporting results this morning too.

New deputy governor Dave Ramsden was pretty dovish this morning, and while his MPC peer Silvana Tenreyro was slightly more open to a rate hike, she said any move is \u2018very contingent on the data\u2019 (which, at the moment, isn\u2019t a great sign for sterling).</p> <p>BoE chief Mark Carney arguably dealt the biggest blow to the pound. Though the central bank head honcho said the MPC thinks a hike may be appropriate \u2018in the coming months\u2019, that comment potentially pushes the pulling of the interest rate trigger beyond the Bank of England\u2019s next meeting in early November.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t all. Carney warned on the negative impact a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit would have on the economy, while stating that businesses are \u2018less confident about a smooth transition\u2019. The OECD also got involved, claiming a \u2018disorderly\u2019 Brexit would reduce Britain\u2019s \u2018long-term growth\u2019.</p> <p>Combine that with the prospect of some miserable wage growth and retail sales figures on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, and some decent import prices and industrial production data from the US, and cable had a truly dreadful afternoon. The pound fell 0.7% against the dollar, sending it back towards $1.31; sterling fared a bit better against the euro, and even then it slipped 0.3%. The FTSE couldn\u2019t squeeze too much growth out of this situation, with the UK index still stuck below 7550, a level its struggled to break for the past week.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59e61603abb06d06a4deaf29\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-17T14:39:55.717Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a chart from ING Bank showing UK inflation excluding the movements in the pound and oil price:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SmithEconomics/status/920243384563961856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Important <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UK</a> chart - stripping out the impact of \u00a3&#39;s fall and oil price effect, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/inflation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#inflation</a> would be below 2%.

A two-tenths upward revision to August was also announced (-0.7% versus -0.9% originally reported).</p> <p>The details show that manufacturing output rose 0.1% month on month, utilities grew 1.5% month on month while mining was up 0.4% month on month. The Federal Reserve had suggested in advance of the report\u2019s publication that the data would be liable to revision given a lack of information on which operations were back up and running after Hurricane Harvey while Hurricane Irma will have had a depressing effect on figures from Florida.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the outlook remains positive with manufacturing set to strengthen in coming months. The domestic story is encouraging with the ISM manufacturing headline figure at a 13 year high while the softer dollar (relative to last year) and strengthening foreign demand should support exports. Meanwhile, mining output should gradually move higher given rising oil prices and rig counts. Consequently, we look for the sector to make a meaningful contribution to fourth quarter GDP even if it has disappointed in third quarter through the hit from the storms.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-59e608002292c906574edd24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2017-10-17T13:47:45.360Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over in the US, industrial production for September has edged up in line with forecasts.</p> <p>It rose 0.3% compared to a decline of 0.7% in August, itself revised up from an initial 0.9% fall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/920277041878126592\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnitedStates?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UnitedStates</a> Industrial Production month-on-month at 0.3%  <a href=\"https://t.co/d2vCgluAuV\">https://t.co/d2vCgluAuV</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/hMBHGW6Noq\">pic.twitter.com/hMBHGW6Noq</a></p>&mdash; Trading Economics (@tEconomics) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tEconomics/status/920277041878126592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 17, 2017</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added around 15 points or 0.07% in early trading to a new record high.

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England has warned that Britain\u2019s financial industry is running out of time for ministers to strike a transitional deal with Brussels over leaving the European Union. Mark Carney told MPs that without a transitional deal banks would need to start moving staff and setting up offices in the EU from as early as the first three months of next year, given it would take at least 18 months to make the changes. Although he said the Bank expected a transitional deal to be agreed before the article 50 process completed in March 2019, Carney insisted Threadneedle Street was making plans for a hard exit as a precaution. Some European banks operating in London had failed to make sufficient plans due to an expectation that a deal would be struck and they would be allowed to remain operating branches in the UK from headquarters in the EU, he added. \u201cI think they now understand the latter is not necessarily going to be the case. We\u2019ll have more to say about that in due course,\u201d he said, speaking at the Treasury select committee on Tuesday. Carney said it was important not to ask banks to make too many changes in a short space of time, for fears over the difficulty of shifting complex financial products such as derivatives, which are used for a variety of reasons including protecting businesses from interest rate changes. Carney\u2019s comments came as City firms were starting to lease office space in Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin and other EU financial centres amid concerns they may not be able to conduct business freely from London after Brexit. Goldman Sachs has booked space in a tower under construction in Frankfurt and it has also reportedly reserved school places in the city in anticipation of moving staff. Uncertainty over the prospects of a transitional deal could put up to 75,000 finance jobs at risk as well as up to \u00a310bn in UK tax revenue, according to lobby group The CityUK. Under questioning from the Commons Treasury select committee, Carney said it would take 18-24 months for banks to take the initial steps required to retain access to trading in the EU. \u201cThere\u2019s a very little amount of time between now and the end of March 2019 to transition large complex financial institutions and activities,\u201d he added. He said anything more ambitious than that, such as Brussels making demands for certain banking activities to take place solely within the EU after Brexit, would be \u201cvery, very risky to do\u201d without a transitional deal. \u201cIt is absolutely in the interests of the EU27 to have a transition agreement,\u201d he said. The Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor, Sam Woods, also used a speech at Mansion House in central London this month to warn that delays in securing a transitional deal would limit the ability of such a deal to stem an exodus from the City.",

      "bodyText": "Doug Robertson took an UberLux to his wedding. This is the ride-hailing app\u2019s top-tier service \u2013 vehicles include Rolls-Royces, Mercedes and Bentley Flying Spurs. The driver made Robertson and his partner feel special, delivered them early and let the couple blast out Mama Cass on the stereo. Robertson, who is 28, is a big fan of Uber at a time when people\u2019s views on the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d are becoming more divided and entrenched. This has become evident in the reaction to Transport for London\u2019s decision not to renew Uber\u2019s licence due to the company \u201cdemonstrating a lack of corporate responsibility\u201d in relation to driver background checks and harassment claims. Over the weekend, I used at least three services that fall under the gig-economy umbrella: Uber, Deliveroo and TaskRabbit. Depending on your point of view, this makes me morally decrepit or simply someone getting on with their life in 2017. As millennials, Robertson and I are part of the generation most likely to use the services offered by the gig economy \u2013 and most likely to be working in it. We are its beneficiaries and its victims. In a preliminary report led by Ursula Huws, a professor of labour and globalisation at Hertfordshire Business School, 50% of those working in what the report deems \u201ccrowd work\u201d in the UK are under 35. At the same time, millennials are enthusiastic users of gig-economy apps and services, whether they are sorting out their laundry, ordering takeaway food or assembling furniture. One survey found that 57% of students in London would use Uber over a black cab, and its popularity extends to students in other cities. While trust in the media and many corporations and NGOs is diminishing, millennials feel strong brand loyalty to gig-economy companies such as Airbnb. When it comes to working in the gig economy, Huws is clear: young people aren\u2019t usually in it by choice. While one in 40 say the gig economy provides the majority of their income, for most it is part of a piecemeal existence; they cannot find other work or they are subsidising other low-paid jobs. There\u2019s a high drop-out rate. Will Diggle, 22, is in the first year of a master\u2019s at the Royal College of Music. A baritone singer living in \u201cdisgustingly expensive\u201d London in order to pursue his desired career, he works three three-hour shifts a week for Deliveroo, while also working as a barista. The pay from his Deliveroo gig mostly covers his food \u2013 then he has rent and tuition fees to cover. He knows of two fellow singers also working for Deliveroo, although one had his bike stolen and is now unable to work. Diggle organises his shifts in advance and is paid an hourly rate of \u00a37, plus a \u00a31 \u201cdrop fee\u201d for every delivery he makes. Other Deliveroo riders (or \u201croos\u201d as the company likes to call them) work on an ad-hoc basis, logging in to the app whenever they choose \u2013 similar to Uber drivers \u2013 and earning between \u00a33.75 and \u00a34.25 for each drop. Diggle prefers the hourly rate because he can align it with his college schedule. Also, if he has to \u201csit around in the freezing cold on the street for two hours waiting for a delivery to come in, which happens so often\u201d, then at least he is getting paid \u00a314. Kieran Hughes, 27, also works for Deliveroo. He has been a rider in Brighton since December 2015; he has another job teaching drums and fairly low housing costs, because he acts as a property guardian (these are people who live without secure tenancy agreements for cheap rent, often to guard empty properties from squatters). Hughes is on the Deliveroo drop rate and says he can make pretty good money if he has, say, four drops an hour. Like many, he was lured by the promise of flexibility. He says he quit a job in a canteen because of management bullying; at first the idea of not answering to a boss was liberating. But the only time riders can earn good money is in peak hours: \u201cWe have to be flexible around the times when the orders are there. It\u2019s not flexible for me to have to work Friday, Saturday and Sunday to make a living.\u201d The upsides of this sort of work have diminished over time. Huws says the golden age for the gig economy was some time around 2013, when companies took a smaller cut and there were fewer drivers/riders/factotums to compete with. \u201cAs Deliveroo pass on all risk to the rider, there\u2019s nothing to stop them over-recruiting in an area and flooding the city with riders, which is exactly what we saw last winter,\u201d says Guy McClenahan, another Brighton rider (Deliveroo maintain that the hundreds of riders in the area earn on average well above the national living wage). Over time, Uber has increased the commission it takes from drivers while reducing fares. Drivers are finding themselves working much longer hours in order to make the same pay \u2013 or far less. (There are currently no time limits on how many hours Uber drivers can work a week in the UK, but the company is testing changes and says it plans to introduce limits over a 24-hour period.) TaskRabbit, the online platform for handymen and odd jobs, which was recently bought by Ikea, took away a rate in which contractors would earn more money for repeat commissions \u2013 and buried that news in an email about introducing the option for clients to tip. I ask Robertson if he worries about the conditions for Uber drivers. \u201cOften, in spaces where companies are disrupting industry, there are going to be lots of new problems that haven\u2019t been discussed before,\u201d he says. \u201cI have never felt guilty about using Uber \u2013 whenever I\u2019ve talked to a driver about it, they\u2019ve always been really positive about their work for the company.\u201d In London, the rallying cry of \u201cWe must support our black cabs!\u201d is loud, but they are eye-wateringly expensive. Some still do not take cards. One has to flag them down, or trek to a taxi rank. Contrast this with Uber, which offers lower prices; drivers who often carry bottled water, magazines, sweets and phone chargers; the option to play one\u2019s own music in the car; and drivers usually no more than five minutes away. Millennials are unfairly derided for many things, but they do have one unattractive characteristic: impatience. For the \u201cclick-get\u201d generation, being made to wait for a train or even a text message response for more than three minutes can feel like impertinence. Huws points out that the gig economy has always existed: cash-in-hand or on-call work or people turning up at building sites or dockyards in the hope of a day\u2019s work. But since the 2008 crash, jobs that provide a secure income have become harder to come by. It is true that the unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK is 12%, while in parts of Europe it is 40%. But that doesn\u2019t mean much if many of those people are in precarious \u201cself-employment\u201d \u2013 the McKinsey Global Institute estimates this may be up to 30% of working-age adults across Europe. Huws says the notion of a career is being eroded, with young people often working a patchwork of different occupations. We laugh about George Osborne having six jobs; if he was a millennial, this would be par for the course. Huws worries about something else, too: the wellbeing of gig-economy millennial workers. This kind of employment can be \u201creally damaging for self-esteem\u201d, she says. As Hughes and Diggle both say, crowd work can be lonely. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019re working a double shift,\u201d says Diggle. \u201cOr sometimes you don\u2019t feel human. You\u2019re just handing a bag over and some people take the bag, don\u2019t look at you and close the door. And then don\u2019t tip. One day I\u2019ll be on stage singing, and the next I\u2019m delivering food on my bicycle and it does feel \u2026 deflating.\u201d In the past, a pat on the back from the boss might have helped. But the gig economy runs on ratings, and millennials talk of being stressed by the constant feedback. Unless they have done something very wrong, I always give my Uber drivers five stars, because I know that if their rating drops below a certain level they will be blocked from the app. The fear is real \u2013 drivers often almost beg for a five-star rating at the end of a journey. Traditional full-time office workers may dread the annual appraisal, but many in the gig economy are being appraised every single day, or even multiple times an hour. And what if this system of ratings, likes and feedback leads to crippling anxiety? There is no sickness pay for the self-employed, no holiday leave, no insurance. There are other health concerns: for Diggle, this means waiting around in the freezing cold, then cycling for miles, or being exposed to pollution. For those on zero-hours contracts, there\u2019s the experience of having to go into work if you\u2019re sick, because these are the only shifts you have been allocated, and you are not sure when, or if, you will get more. It is convenient for businesses to treat people as \u201ccontractors\u201d rather than employees because this way they avoid paying national insurance contributions (13.8% of an employee\u2019s wage). They also take on little to no liability. Deliveroo requests that its riders wear a helmet, and Diggle does, but he tells me this is not enforced. Riders pay \u00a3150 for the kit (it used to be a deposit), and the company will provide bike lights, but riders provide their own bikes and there is no checking that the bike is suitable or road-safe. Outsourcing labour means companies have virtually zero duty of care. One driver for delivery company Hermes was sacked and told \u201cparcels come first\u201d when he left a shift because of the premature birth of his child. Another Deliveroo rider in Dublin wrote an account in the Irish Independent of taking a serious fall from her bike, and a Deliveroo customer services rep asking: \u201cIs the food OK?\u201d (Diggle tells me that, when he has had issues, he has been able to call the customer service number and has spoken to someone helpful. All other communication with the company is via automated text.) This year, Maggie Dewhurst, the 30-year-old vice-president of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), won her employment-rights case against the courier firm CitySprint, with the tribunal ruling that she should be classed as a worker rather than an independent contractor. IWGB is bringing a similar case against Deliveroo on behalf of its Camden cohort, fighting for minimum wage; the case is currently at the government\u2019s Central Arbitration Committee. In Bristol, workers recently staged their own protest. Dewhurst points out that the wider casualisation of work is a problem. She reckons about 50% of the union\u2019s members are millennials, although she stresses that the increase in political engagement among the young hasn\u2019t automatically resulted in mass union membership. She says millennials are used to outsourced work, and are adaptable and resilient. More than that, argues Huws, they have grown up in a climate of unpaid internships and terrifying probation periods, the first generation \u201cexpected to work for free\u201d. For many, all they know is being part of the precariat. Or, as Huws puts it in no uncertain terms, \u201ctoday\u2019s model of the working poor\u201d. We think of the gig economy through the best-known apps: Uber, Airbnb, Deliveroo. But there are also listing sites such as Gumtree or Craigslist where people go to seek work. All of this is \u201can enormously grey area\u201d, says Huws, \u201cand that makes it impossible to legislate for, until we have a definition of an online platform. One of the things we could do is make the onus on [the platform] to prove that they are not employment agencies, which would bring them into the scope of regulations.\u201d Offline, zero-hours contracts have become ubiquitous, whether it\u2019s Sports Direct, McDonald\u2019s, hairdressing or nursing. (Jeremy Hunt announced at the Conservative party conference that the NHS would even be trialling a flexible-working app. \u201cThe idea that there is some untapped reserve of labour in the NHS that can be unlocked with an app is pure fantasy,\u201d said the GMB union.) Theresa May has promised to tackle the gig economy. In October 2016, she commissioned a six-month review led by Matthew Taylor, a former head of Tony Blair\u2019s policy unit. One key thing the Taylor review did not recommend implementing was a guaranteed statutory minimum wage for each hour worked. Dewhurst believes that, \u201cas we stand now, we have more legal protection than we would if [Taylor\u2019s] recommendations were implemented\u201d. The fundamental failing of the Taylor review, says Huws, is that it does not recognise that \u201cthe employment law we have, and the social security system in the UK, is not fit for purpose in the 21st century and that it needs to be redesigned ... We know there are genuine freelancers. Let\u2019s define what that is in a much tighter way. Then everybody else is, by default, a dependent worker with certain rights. Put the onus on to the employer to prove why they shouldn\u2019t have those rights.\u201d Obviously, the gig economy isn\u2019t all bad. When work is truly flexible, and is provided by a responsible employer, that\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s not when your work involves waiting for the phone call that will announce your next shift, or not being paid for overtime, or having to buy your own equipment. After all, \u201cflexible\u201d can also mean contorting oneself into painful positions just to make ends meet. I want to enjoy Uber and not feel bad about it. As Dewhurst says, this is difficult when they appear to view fair treatment of those working for them as \u201chaemorrhaging money\u201d. And there are alternatives \u2013 CityMapper, for instance, has partnered with Gett and is trialling a flat-fare \u201ctaxi-bus\u201d. I\u2019m going to buy a bike and I already walk a lot. I\u2019m going to cook more and better, rather than using Deliveroo. I\u2019m looking out for start-ups such as PicFair, which utilises tech to help photographers reach the marketplace, while treating them fairly. But, for the time being, millennials remain shackled to the gig economy via addiction to its services and as one of the few ways to earn extra cash. I ask Diggle if he will continue riding for Deliveroo until the end of his course. \u201cYes,\u201d he says. Then he changes his mind. \u201cActually, probably not. Because the longer you do this job, the less you like it.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Doug Robertson took an UberLux to his wedding. This is the ride-hailing app\u2019s top-tier service \u2013 vehicles include Rolls-Royces, Mercedes and Bentley Flying Spurs. The driver made Robertson and his partner feel special, delivered them early and let the couple blast out Mama Cass on the stereo.</p> <p>Robertson, who is 28, is a big fan of Uber at a time when people\u2019s views on the so-called \u201cgig economy\u201d are becoming more divided and entrenched. This has become evident in the reaction to Transport for London\u2019s decision not to renew Uber\u2019s licence due to the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/25/uber-tfl-concerns-vows-keep-operating-london-licence\">\u201cdemonstrating a lack of corporate responsibility\u201d</a> in relation to driver background checks and harassment claims.</p> <p>Over the weekend, I used at least three services that fall under the gig-economy umbrella: Uber, Deliveroo and TaskRabbit. Depending on your point of view, this makes me morally decrepit or simply someone getting on with their life in 2017. As millennials, Robertson and I are part of the generation most likely to use the services offered by the gig economy \u2013 and most likely to be working in it. We are its beneficiaries and its victims.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://researchprofiles.herts.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/ursula-huws(5231f0dc-26ad-450e-925a-cf1f6629d5b5).html\">a preliminary report led by Ursula Huws</a>, a professor of labour and globalisation at Hertfordshire Business School, 50% of those working in what the report deems \u201ccrowd work\u201d in the UK are under 35. At the same time, millennials are enthusiastic users of gig-economy apps and services, whether they are sorting out their laundry, ordering takeaway food or assembling furniture. One survey found that 57% of students in London would use Uber over a black cab, and its popularity extends to students in other cities. While<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanadams/2015/01/20/trust-in-business-media-and-ngos-is-going-down-everywhere/#72862e327fb6\"> trust in the media and many corporations and NGOs is diminishing</a>, millennials feel <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/geoff-smith/millennials-becoming-more-loyal-in-era-of-consumer-choice.html\">strong brand loyalty to gig-economy</a> companies such as Airbnb.</p> <p>When it comes to working in the gig economy, Huws is clear: young people aren\u2019t usually in it by choice. While one in 40 say the gig economy provides the majority of their income, for most it is part of a piecemeal existence; they cannot find other work or they are subsidising other low-paid jobs. There\u2019s a high drop-out rate.</p> <p>Will Diggle, 22, is in the first year of a master\u2019s at the Royal College of Music. A baritone singer living in \u201cdisgustingly expensive\u201d London in order to pursue his desired career, he works three three-hour shifts a week for Deliveroo, while also working as a barista. The pay from his Deliveroo gig mostly covers his food \u2013 then he has rent and tuition fees to cover. He knows of two fellow singers also working for Deliveroo, although one had his bike stolen and is now unable to work.</p> <p>Diggle organises his shifts in advance and is paid an hourly rate of \u00a37, plus a \u00a31 \u201cdrop fee\u201d for every delivery he makes. Other Deliveroo riders (or \u201croos\u201d as the company likes to call them) work on an ad-hoc basis, logging in to the app whenever they choose \u2013 similar to Uber drivers \u2013 and earning between \u00a33.75 and \u00a34.25 for each drop. Diggle prefers the hourly rate because he can align it with his college schedule. Also, if he has to \u201csit around in the freezing cold on the street for two hours waiting for a delivery to come in, which happens so often\u201d, then at least he is getting paid \u00a314.</p> <p>Kieran Hughes, 27, also works for Deliveroo. He has been a rider in Brighton since December 2015; he has another job teaching drums and fairly low housing costs, because he acts as a property guardian (these are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/24/the-high-price-of-cheap-living-how-the-property-guardianship-dream-soured\">people who live without secure tenancy agreements for cheap rent</a>, often to guard empty properties from squatters). Hughes is on the Deliveroo drop rate and says he can make pretty good money if he has, say, four drops an hour. Like many, he was lured by the promise of flexibility. He says he quit a job in a canteen because of management bullying; at first the idea of not answering to a boss was liberating. But the only time riders can earn good money is in peak hours: \u201cWe have to be flexible around the times when the orders are there. It\u2019s not flexible for me to have to work Friday, Saturday and Sunday to make a living.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/24/inside-gig-economy-vulnerable-human-underbelly-of-uk-labour-market\">Inside the gig economy: the 'vulnerable human underbelly' of UK's labour market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The upsides of this sort of work have diminished over time. Huws says the golden age for the gig economy was some time around 2013, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/12/uber-drivers-protest-at-fee-hike-in-first-london-demo\">companies took a smaller cut</a> and there were fewer drivers/riders/factotums to compete with. \u201cAs Deliveroo pass on all risk to the rider, there\u2019s nothing to stop them over-recruiting in an area and flooding the city with riders, which is exactly what we saw last winter,\u201d says Guy McClenahan, another Brighton rider (Deliveroo maintain that the hundreds of riders in the area earn on average well above the national living wage). Over time, Uber has increased the commission it takes from drivers while reducing fares. Drivers are finding themselves working much longer hours in order to make the same pay \u2013 or far less. (There are currently no time limits on how many hours Uber drivers can work a week in the UK, but the company is testing changes and says <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/273599/uber-cap-driver-hours-10-12-hours-within-24-hour-period-uk\">it plans to introduce limits over a 24-hour period</a>.) TaskRabbit, the online platform for handymen and odd jobs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/28/ikea-buys-taskrabbit-gig-economy-tradespeople\">which was recently bought by Ikea</a>, took away a rate in which contractors would earn more money for repeat commissions \u2013 and buried that news in an email about introducing the option for clients to tip.</p> <p>I ask Robertson if he worries about the conditions for Uber drivers. \u201cOften, in spaces where companies are disrupting industry, there are going to be lots of new problems that haven\u2019t been discussed before,\u201d he says. \u201cI have never felt guilty about using Uber \u2013 whenever I\u2019ve talked to a driver about it, they\u2019ve always been really positive about their work for the company.\u201d</p> <p>In London, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/oct/05/uber-tfl-black-cabs-whats-missing-from-debate\">rallying cry of \u201cWe must support our black cabs!\u201d</a> is loud, but they are eye-wateringly expensive. Some still do not take cards. One has to flag them down, or trek to a taxi rank. Contrast this with Uber, which offers lower prices; drivers who often carry bottled water, magazines, sweets and phone chargers; the option to play one\u2019s own music in the car; and drivers usually no more than five minutes away. Millennials are unfairly derided for many things, but they do have one unattractive characteristic: impatience. For the \u201cclick-get\u201d generation, being made to wait for a train or even a text message response for more than three minutes can feel like impertinence.</p> <p>Huws points out that the gig economy has always existed: cash-in-hand or on-call work or people turning up at building sites or dockyards in the hope of a day\u2019s work. But since the 2008 crash, jobs that provide a secure income have become harder to come by. It is true that the <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05871\">unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds in the UK is 12%</a>, while in parts of Europe it is 40%. But that doesn\u2019t mean much if many of those people are in precarious \u201cself-employment\u201d \u2013 the McKinsey Global Institute estimates this may be up to 30% of working-age adults across Europe. Huws says the notion of a career is being eroded, with young people often working a patchwork of different occupations. We laugh about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/30/george-osborne-six-jobs-economics-degree-manchester-university\">George Osborne having six jobs</a>; if he was a millennial, this would be par for the course.</p> <p>Huws worries about something else, too: the wellbeing of gig-economy millennial workers. This kind of employment can be \u201creally damaging for self-esteem\u201d, she says. As Hughes and Diggle both say, crowd work can be lonely. \u201cEspecially if you\u2019re working a double shift,\u201d says Diggle. \u201cOr sometimes you don\u2019t feel human. You\u2019re just handing a bag over and some people take the bag, don\u2019t look at you and close the door. And then don\u2019t tip. One day I\u2019ll be on stage singing, and the next I\u2019m delivering food on my bicycle and it does feel \u2026 deflating.\u201d</p> <p>In the past, a pat on the back from the boss might have helped.

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson has revealed he was the target of two elaborate confidence tricks \u2013 one involving someone posing as the defence secretary, Sir Michael Fallon, in a phone call \u2013 that saw a \u201cvery successful\u201d business associate swindled out of $2m (\u00a31.5m). \u201cThis story sounds like it has come straight out of a John le Carr\u00e9 book or a James Bond film, but it is sadly all true,\u201d the Virgin billionaire said. Branson said the first attempted scam began when he received a letter six months ago, on what appeared to be official government notepaper, requesting an urgent phone call with Fallon. He spoke to someone who sounded \u201cexactly like\u201d Fallon and told him that a British diplomat had been kidnapped and was being held to ransom. \u201cHe told me that British laws prevented the government from paying out ransoms, which he normally completely concurred with,\u201d Branson said in a blog describing the attempted scam. \u201cBut he said on this occasion there was a particular, very sensitive, reason why they had to get this diplomat back. \u201cSo they were extremely confidentially asking a syndicate of British businesspersons to step in. \u201cI was asked to contribute $5m of the ransom money, which he assured me the British government would find a way of paying back.\u201d Branson said the person posing as Fallon told him he could verify that the kidnap plot was real by sending a senior staff member to Whitehall to speak with his secretary, who would use the codeword \u201cDavenport\u201d. The Virgin tycoon said the caller \u201csounded exactly like Sir Michael\u201d but that when he rang Fallon\u2019s office, the defence secretary assured him nobody had been kidnapped and that he had made no request to help with a ransom. He passed details of the failed scam to the police but was again targeted six months later with a separate \u201cheist of enormous scale\u201d that saw a business associate of Branson\u2019s conned out of $2m. In this case, someone doing an \u201cextremely accurate\u201d impression of Branson asked a US businessman by telephone to provide a three-week loan of $2m to help rebuild the British Virgin Islands after Hurricane Irma. \u201cThey claimed I couldn\u2019t get hold of my bank in the UK because I didn\u2019t have any communications going to Europe and I\u2019d only just managed to make a satellite call to the businessman in America. \u201cThe business person, incredibly graciously, gave $2m, which promptly disappeared. \u201cI spoke to the business person and had to tell him specific details of our last get-together before he was convinced it was really me and not the conman. We quickly realised he had been duped out of his money by a criminal pretending to be me.\u201d Branson said the business associate could not believe how stupid he had been. \u201cHe is an incredibly generous person who gives to all sorts of causes, and it is just too sad for words that of all people it was he who had fallen for it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry for this incredibly kind man and incredibly grateful that they were willing to help us after the hurricane. If only their money had gone to the people of the BVI, not the conman.\u201d Branson asked anyone with any information about the scam to speak to US criminal authorities or get in touch with Virgin.",

      "bodyText": "Bombardier has raised hopes of safeguarding 1,000 jobs in Belfast, saying it was confident a deal for Airbus to take a majority stake in the C-Series jet programme would help it avoid punishing US import tariffs. The two companies hope to circumvent the 300% import tariff by assembling the C-Series passenger jets destined for US customers at Airbus\u2019s factory in Alabama. Should the deal proceed, the manufacture of wings for the C-Series is expected to remain in Belfast, where 1,000 people are employed on the programme. Bombardier employs a further 3,000 people in Belfast on other projects. \u201cBombardier remains committed to our Northern Ireland operations,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said. \u201cThis deal allows us to continue to support the jobs associated with the C-Series in Belfast and gives us more stability.\u201d The Canadian company\u2019s share price was up by nearly 20% in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange on Tuesday after the announcement of the Airbus deal. It is the latest twist in a bitter trade row between Bombardier and Boeing, the American aircraft maker which complained that aid from the Canadian and UK governments amounted to illegal subsidy, allowing Bombardier to sell its C-Series jets at \u201cabsurdly low\u201d prices in the US. The complaint was upheld by the US Department of Commerce, which slapped the huge tariff on the Montreal-based company, putting a contract with US airline Delta and the whole C-Series programme at risk. \u201cAssembly in the US can resolve the issue,\u201d said Alain Bellemare, the chief executive of Bombardier, of the steep import levy in the US, adding that the two companies hoped to finalise the deal within six to 12 months. However, Boeing warned that its two rivals should \u201cthink again\u201d if they believed the deal would allow them to avoid the levy. Phil Musser, Boeing\u2019s senior vice-president of communications, tweeted: Boeing added in a separate statement: \u201cThis looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidised competitors to skirt the US government findings. Everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work.\u201d Unite, the UK\u2019s largest union, welcomed the partnership between Bombardier and Airbus but cautioned it was not 100% satisfied that jobs in Northern Ireland were secure. \u201cThis news gives us cause to have some hope, but we are far from out of the woods and there is still much work to do to secure Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK,\u201d said Steve Turner, assistant general secretary at Unite with responsibility for aerospace. \u201cThe deal could take a year or so to get through the relevant competition authorities while Boeing in the US is unlikely to sit idly by. During this period there is a danger that tariffs will be imposed and the C-Series will be effectively locked out of aviation\u2019s largest market.\u201d The business secretary, Greg Clark, said the partnership was \u201ca very big step forward\u201d in safeguarding Bombardier jobs in Belfast. \u201cNot only has Airbus committed to Belfast being the home of the wing manufacturer for the C-Series, but they are pointing to the possibility of expanding the output and the order book,\u201d he said. Clark added that he would continue to work with the Canadian government to fight the Boeing complaint. Under the terms of the new partnership, Airbus would take a 50.1% stake in the C-Series programme. It would leave Bombardier with about 31%, while the financier Investissement Qu\u00e9bec would own about 19%. Boeing complained to US authorities in April that aid received by Bombardier from the Canadian and UK governments amounted to illegal subsidies, allowing it to sell its C-Series jets to the US airline Delta at below cost price. Delta has placed a $5.6bn (\u00a34.2bn) order for up to 125 of the new aircraft, with delivery due to begin next year.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "UK interest rate rise likely as inflation hits 3%", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The prospect of Britain\u2019s first interest rate increase in more than a decade loomed large on Tuesday after inflation hit its highest level since 2012 and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said it had further to rise. Financial markets are now betting strongly on Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee reversing the quarter-point cut in borrowing costs made in the aftermath of last year\u2019s Brexit vote after the annual increase in the cost of living edged up from 2.9 to 3%. Carney did nothing to defuse speculation of a rate rise when he gave evidence to the Treasury select committee, pointing out that the fall in the value of the pound since the referendum \u2013 which has pushed up import prices \u2013 will take up to three years to work its way through the economy. Higher borrowing costs will come at a time when the gap between inflation at 3% and earnings growth at just over 2% is squeezing living standards. But in recent months a majority of MPC members appear poised to vote for a rate rise, fearing that the steady fall in unemployment will set off a spiral of rising prices and wages unless checked now. One group that will not be affected by the cost of living squeeze will be Britain\u2019s pensioners, since the state pension will be uprated next spring by whichever is highest of the September consumer price index inflation rate, average earnings or 2.5%. Inflation has risen from 1% to 3% over the past year, largely due to the fall in the value of the pound, which has made imports dearer. Speaking after the publication of the figures on Tuesday, Carney said it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he would soon be writing his ninth letter to the Treasury to explain his failure to keep inflation within 1 percentage point of its target of 2%. Under questioning from the Commons Treasury select committee, he said the weak pound after the Brexit vote was the sole reason for inflation rising as much as it has. He said the effect of the weak pound \u2013 still more than 10% down on the dollar \u2013 would still be felt three years after the referendum. The governor said he needed to strike a balance between targeting rising prices and supporting jobs and activity with low rates. With unemployment at its lowest level since the mid-1970s, Carney said the \u201ctrade-off has moved away,\u201d from using monetary policy to support growth and employment, paving the way for a rate rise. In a breakdown of the latest inflation numbers, the Office for National Statistics said the cost of fuel and raw materials for industry was up by 8.4% on a year ago compared with a 7.6% increase in the 12 months to August. It said more expensive food and a smaller fall in airfares than a year ago were the main factors behind the rate rise, although clothes had come down in price. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: \u201cThe government needs to face up to Britain\u2019s cost-of-living crisis. The squeeze on household budgets is getting tighter by the month. \u201cThe chancellor must use November\u2019s budget to ease the pressure on hard-pressed families. That means giving 5 million public sector workers the pay rise they have earned.\u201d The head of inflation at the ONS, Mike Prestwood, said: \u201cFood prices and a range of transport costs helped to push up inflation in September. These effects were partly offset by clothing prices that rose less strongly than this time last year. \u201cWhile oil and fuel costs continued to rise, overall the rates of inflation for raw materials and goods leaving factories were little changed in September.\u201d Paul Hollingsworth, a UK analyst at consultancy Capital Economics, said a further increase in inflation to 3.2% was likely in October, forcing Carney to write to the chancellor, Philip Hammond. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t anticipate he will be writing letters for long. Indeed, we think inflation will be back below 3% by the end of this year. And while it looks set to remain above the monetary policy committee target throughout next year, we think it will end 2018 at around 2.25%.\u201d Meanwhile, Sir David Ramsden, the Bank\u2019s new deputy governor, told the Treasury committee he wasn\u2019t among the majority of rate setters at Threadneedle Street who saw a need for a rate rise in the coming months.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "European aircraft giant Airbus is taking a majority stake in Bombardier\u2019s controversial C-Series jet programme, potentially safeguarding 1,000 jobs in Belfast. The French-based plane maker is acquiring 50.1% of the programme, the future of which was left in doubt after Canadian company Bombardier was hit by a 300% import levy by the United States. The huge tariff followed a complaint from Boeing that the company had dumped its C-Series jets at \u201cabsurdly low\u201d prices. Unite, the UK\u2019s largest union, welcomed the new partnership and said the manufacture of wings for the C-Series would remain in Belfast where 1,000 people are employed on the programme. \u201cWe have received assurances that this will mean that employment associated with the manufacture of C-Series wings will remain in Belfast,\u201d said Davy Thompson, regional officer of Unite. \u201cUnite will continue our efforts to ensure the withdrawal of the US tariffs on the C-Series but this is a welcome development - one that gives \u2018breathing space\u2019 to the C-Series itself and which we anticipate should safeguard the future of C Series production jobs in Belfast for the foreseeable future.\u201d In a sign of the extent of the challenges facing Bombardier, Airbus did not pay anything for the majority stake. The European aircraft manufacturer will use its global firepower and supply chain to provide procurement, sales and marketing, and customer support to the jet programme. The business secretary, Greg Clark, said the partnership was \u201ca very big step forward\u201d. \u201cNot only has Airbus committed to Belfast being the home of the wing manufacturer for the C-series, but they are pointing to the possibility of expanding the output and the order book,\u201d he said. The deal will leave Bombardier with about 31% of the C-Series programme, while financier Investissement Qu\u00e9bec will own about 19%. Boeing complained to US authorities in April that aid received by Bombardier from the Canadian and UK governments amounted to illegal subsidies, allowing it to sell its C-Series jets to the US airline Delta for below cost price. Delta has placed a $5.6bn (\u00a34.2bn) order for up to 125 of the new jets, with delivery due to begin next year. The US Department of Commerce found in favour of Boeing, and slapped a 300% tariff on C-series jets imported into the US. Airbus is hoping to solve the problem posed by the tariffs by assembling the C-Series jets destined for US customers at its own factory in Alabama. Ross Murdoch, national officer at the GMB union, welcomed the deal between Airbus and Bombardier but warned \u201cthe devil will be in the detail\u201d, with potential new problems created by Airbus\u2019s plans to assemble the C-Series in the US. \u201cThis deal is liable to further scrutiny from the US administration that may see it as an attempt to dodge their trade tariffs,\u201d Murdoch said. \u201cGMB hopes both Bombardier and Airbus have taken cast iron legal advice to ensure they don\u2019t get rid on one legal challenge only to open themselves up to another.\u201d Bombardier employs a total of 4,000 people in Belfast, including 1,000 on the C-Series programme. It is unclear what the future holds for those workers in Northern Ireland not employed on the jet project. \u201cWhile we welcome this announcement in regard to the C Series, there are continued challenges associated with employment on other Bombardier contracts in Belfast,\u201d said Unite\u2019s Thompson. \u201cWe will be engaging with management and our membership to safeguard all workers\u2019 interests in the coming period.\u201d The proposed tariffs have put huge pressure on Bombardier, leaving workers in Northern Ireland fearful for their jobs. Both the UK and Canadian governments have previously threatened to hit back at Boeing by denying the company defence work. Airbus\u2019s chief executive, Tom Enders, said in a statement: \u201cThis is a win-win for everybody. The C Series, with its state-of-the-art design and great economics, is a great fit with our existing single-aisle aircraft family and rapidly extends our product offering into a fast growing market sector. \u201cI have no doubt that our partnership with Bombardier will boost sales and the value of this programme tremendously. Not only will this partnership secure the C Series and its industrial operations in Canada, the UK and China, but we also bring new jobs to the US. Airbus will benefit from strengthening its product portfolio in the high-volume single-aisle market, offering superior value to our airline customers worldwide.\u201d Alain Bellemare, president and chief executive officer of Bombardier, said it was very pleased to welcome Airbus to the C Series programme. \u201cAirbus is the perfect partner for us, Quebec and Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cThis partnership should more than double the value of the C Series programme and ensures our remarkable game-changing aircraft realises its full potential.\u201d The move was also welcomed by Dominique Anglade, Quebec\u2019s deputy prime minister, who said: \u201cThe arrival of Airbus as a strategic partner today will ensure the sustainability and growth of the C Series programme, as well as consolidating the entire Quebec aerospace cluster.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "TheCityUK is a lobbying group whose dire warnings about the potential loss of trade and jobs from the City of London tend to infuriate true believers in Brexit. Too gloomy, say hardcore Brexiters. A few jobs may go, runs their argument, but Frankfurt, Paris, Luxembourg and Dublin are too small to inflict lasting damage on London. Besides, the rest of the EU will come to its senses eventually and realise that a fragmented European financial industry would serve nobody\u2019s interests, apart from perhaps New York\u2019s. There is some truth in those objections, of course, since it is true that London currently plays in a different league as a European financial centre. But it is also time for all sides to acknowledge TheCityUK was 100% correct on a common-sense point it has shouted from the rooftops from the outset: a transitional deal that is signed at the eleventh hour of negotiations won\u2019t be worth much. Sam Woods, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, captured the argument when he said \u201cdiminishing marginal returns\u201d would start to kick in around Christmas. \u201cFirms would start discounting the likelihood of a transition in the central case of their planning,\u201d he said. Indeed, there was more than a whiff of contingency plans being executed when Goldman Sachs said this month it will lease eight floors of new office block in Frankfurt, enough to house 800 people. Does Goldman actually want to add 800 jobs in Frankfurt? One suspects not. Like most big London-concentrated investment banks, it would prefer Brexit to involve as little disruption to its business as possible. But, in the absence of transitional deal, it has to cover all possibilities. For Goldman et al, it doesn\u2019t matter if UK division or EU belligerence is mostly to blame for the current stalemate. Banks just look at their own interests, which means keeping clients and local regulators happy.

The most gruesome predictions of the eventual whack to the City \u2013 up to 75,000 and \u00a38bn-\u00a310bn in lost tax revenues \u2013 still feel too dramatic. But it\u2019s no longer possible to dismiss the figures, as some Brexiters do, as a flight of fancy. Events are happening on the ground. How ConvaTec fell ill ConvaTec is one of those FTSE 100 companies that rarely commands attention because its business \u2013 making medical products such as colostomy bags, catheters and wound care treatments \u2013 seems so dull. How wrong we were. ConvaTec managed to remove 25% of its stock value, equivalent to \u00a31.3bn, with a thumping profits warning on Monday. ConvaTec has made a botch of the superficially simple job of shutting a factory in North Carolina in the US and shifting its production to the Dominican Republic. The move didn\u2019t go as planned, output was constrained and a backlog of orders built up. A hurricane didn\u2019t help the dispatch of goods either. The company may call this is \u201ca temporary but painful setback\u201d but you can understand why the shares were savaged. First, there should have been a better back-up plan: ConvaTec could have held more stock in reserve. Second, the company undermined its big pitch to investors at flotation last year. The promise was that gross margins could be improved by three percentage points by 2020 but, while the ambition remains, the arrival date is now up in the air. Third, ConvaTec has destroyed the easy idea that a big operator in a growing market could be relied upon to improve revenues at an annual clip of 5% or so. Organic growth will be between 1% and 2% this year, the company says now. Is it completely coincidental that ConvaTec was owned by two private equity houses before last year\u2019s float at 225p? Private equity, remember, has a reputation for hollowing out businesses before offering them for sale. On this occassion, however, it\u2019s hard to make the charge stick. Nordic and Avista may have flogged the bulk of their stake at prices far higher than Monday\u2019s closing level of 205p, but the production cock-up seems to a straightforward case of over-ambition and bad planning. That nuance, however, won\u2019t help to restore ConvaTec\u2019s City reputation. Famous chairman Sir Christopher Gent, once of Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline, has his work cut out. Aramco IPO and China Saudi Arabia\u2019s latest idea, it is reported, is to forget about an international listing for Aramco, the state oil company, and instead flog a 5% stake to Chinese investors. This plan could definitely be achieved since China would probably be willing to play ball, and might even pay a higher initial price than international investors would. But it\u2019s hard to see how the Saudis\u2019 long-term interests would improve. If the country\u2019s rulers want permanent access to ready cash, they need to widen the pool of investors in Aramco. Having to ring Beijing when you want to sell the next 5% is not a good position to be in.",

      "body": "<p>TheCityUK is a lobbying group whose dire warnings about the potential loss of trade and jobs from the City of London tend to infuriate true believers in Brexit. Too gloomy, say hardcore Brexiters. A few jobs may go, runs their argument, but Frankfurt, Paris, Luxembourg and Dublin are too small to inflict lasting damage on London. Besides, the rest of the EU will come to its senses eventually and realise that a fragmented European financial industry would serve nobody\u2019s interests, apart from perhaps New York\u2019s.</p> <p>There is some truth in those objections, of course, since it is true that London currently plays in a different league as a European financial centre. But it is also time for all sides to acknowledge TheCityUK was 100% correct on a common-sense point it has shouted from the rooftops from the outset: a transitional deal that is signed at the eleventh hour of negotiations won\u2019t be worth much.</p> <p>Sam Woods, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, captured the argument <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/04/eu-transition-deal-is-needed-quickly-to-stop-city-firms-leaving-uk-says-bank-official\">when he said</a> \u201cdiminishing marginal returns\u201d would start to kick in around Christmas. \u201cFirms would start discounting the likelihood of a transition in the central case of their planning,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Indeed, there was more than a whiff of contingency plans being executed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/05/goldman-sachs-boosts-post-brexit-plans-with-frankfurt-office-deal\">Goldman Sachs said this month it will lease eight floors of new office block in Frankfurt</a>, enough to house 800 people. Does Goldman actually want to add 800 jobs in Frankfurt? One suspects not. Like most big London-concentrated investment banks, it would prefer Brexit to involve as little disruption to its business as possible.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Workers in the constituency of shadow chancellor John McDonnell are at the highest risk of seeing their jobs automated in the looming workplace revolution that will affect at least one in five employees in all parliamentary seats, according to new research. The thinktank Future Advocacy \u2013 which specialises in looking at the big 21st century policy changes \u2013 said at least one-fifth of jobs in all 650 constituencies were at high risk of being automated, rising to almost 40% in McDonnell\u2019s west London seat of Hayes and Harlington. The thinktank\u2019s report also found that the public was largely untroubled by the risk that their job might be at threat. Only 2% of a sample of more than 2,000 people were very worried that they might be replaced by a machine, with a further 5% fairly worried. Future Advocacy\u2019s report has been based on a PWC study earlier this year showing that more than 10 million workers were at risk of being replaced by automation and represents the first attempt to show the impact at local level. The thinktank said McDonnell\u2019s seat would be affected because it contains Heathrow airport, which has a large number of warehousing jobs that could be automated. Of the 92,150 employees in Hayes and Harlington in 2015, 36,170 (39.3%) were at high risk of having their jobs automated by the early 2030s. Crawley \u2013 the seat that includes Gatwick airport \u2013 was seen as the second most vulnerable constituency. Future Advocacy said its report was an \u201cattempt to encourage a geographically more sophisticated understanding of, and response to, the future of work, and also an attempt to encourage MPs to pay more attention to this critical issue\u201d. Opinion is divided on the likely impact of the artificial intelligence revolution on jobs. Optimists have said that the lesson from history is that technological change leads to more jobs being created than destroyed, while pessimists have argued that AI is different because the new machines will be able to do intellectual as well as routine physical tasks. \u201cOne thing that almost all economists agree on is that change is coming and that its scale and scope will be unprecedented. Automation will impact different geographies, genders, and socioeconomic classes differently,\u201d the report noted. It added that \u201cthe highest levels of future automation are predicted in Britain\u2019s former industrial heartlands in the Midlands and the north of England, as well as the industrial centres of Scotland. These are areas which have already suffered from deindustrialisation and many of them are unemployment hot spots.\u201d Olly Buston, one of the report\u2019s authors, said it was vital that lessons were learned from the 1980s. \u201cLet\u2019s not have a repeat of the collapse of the coal-mining industry,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we should have a smarter strategy.\u201d Noting that there would be a political pay off for the party that came up with the best strategy for coping with the robot age, the report makes a number of recommendations for the government. They include: publishing a white paper on adapting the education system so that it focuses on creativity and interpersonal skills in addition to the stem subjects of science, technology, engineering and maths; developing a post-Brexit migration policy that allows UK-based AI companies and universities to attract the best talent; exploring ways to ensure the benefits of the AI revolution are spread through research into alternative income and taxation models, including investigation of a universal basic income; and conducting further detailed research to assess which employees were most at risk of losing their jobs. The report said that it was \u201carguably automation \u2013 rather than globalisation \u2013 that has created the economic and social conditions that led to political shockwaves such as the election of Donald Trump and the vote for Brexit. \u201cAs artificial intelligence supercharges automation over the next decade, and this hits different groups differently, there will again profound social and political consequences. Our politicians should surely consider this carefully.\u201d The report found that the leaders of the four main Westminster parties represented seats where more than 25% of jobs were at high risk of being automated, while the constituency with the lowest proportion of high-risk jobs was Labour-held Edinburgh South. High-risk constituencies typically contained large numbers of people working in transport or manufacturing, while lower-risk constituencies \u2013 including Edinburgh South, Wirral West and Oxford East \u2013 had high concentrations of workers employed in education and health.",
