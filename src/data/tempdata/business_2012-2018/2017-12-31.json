      "bodyText": "Forty years ago, Ian Dury and the Blockheads released Reasons to be Cheerful, Part 3 \u2013 listing some of the better things in life as Margaret Thatcher became prime minister in the months following the winter of discontent. Fast forward to the opening days of 2018 and fresh political tumult threatens to cripple Britain once more. There are, however, some reasons to be cheerful about the prospects for the UK economy. Despite the political to-and-fro of the past year, the UK economy enters 2018 in better health than many would have given it credit for. The post-referendum recession never materialised. Consumers have kept calm and carried on spending against the odds, and global growth and a resurgent eurozone are helping to buoy British manufacturers. Threats to this stability range from a collapse in Brexit talks to the biggest squeeze on living standards in generations and a slowdown in job creation, while political uncertainty will force businesses to delay much-needed investments to boost productivity. Captains of industry say the end of March is the deadline for a deal on the terms of transition to exit the EU. If that deadline is missed, they would be forced to make decisions that could have negative consequences for jobs and investment. At the start of each year, economists make predictions for the path ahead, often to be proven wrong within a few months. With that in mind, here are three reasons to at least be a little bit cheerful about the UK economy in 2018 \u2013 with a handful of health warnings attached. Growth won\u2019t slow as much as feared This time last year, the view was that growth would slow to 1% for the year. The UK hasn\u2019t been able to keep pace with its biggest economic rivals and it is forecast to come bottom of the OECD league table next year as a result of the EU referendum result, but growth is now expected to be a reasonable 1.5% for 2017. It could have been closer to 2% without Brexit, according to some economists, but it\u2019s far from the recession some envisaged. This trend could persist into 2018, confounding the worst forecasts for the rate of expansion to slow closer to 1%. The consultancy Capital Economics reckons growth could be as robust as 2.2% in 2018, seeing few reasons why resilience among consumers to keep on spending should come to an end. That would come as a shot in the arm for the country, beating the gloomy official forecasts that Philip Hammond unveiled alongside his budget for growth of 1.4% in 2018. Add the recovery in the global economy to the mix and Britain could find that a rising tide lifts all boats, no matter how battered they may be. Manufacturers stand to benefit from selling their goods abroad, helped by the pound\u2019s weakness since the Brexit vote making British goods more competitive. There may be trouble ahead, however, because businesses could put their investment plans on ice if concerns about the UK\u2019s future trading rules with the EU linger. Households are also still facing higher inflation and sluggish pay increases, which could hold growth back. The worst of the earnings squeeze will fade British households have had a torrid 2017, seeing prices in the shops rise at rapid rates. This is because of the weak pound, which has pushed up the cost of importing goods to the UK. Wages have risen nowhere near as much. The impact from sterling\u2019s rapid devaluation is gradually being washed out of the system though, and the Bank of England reckons inflation probably peaked just above 3% in the final months of 2017 and is on track to fall in the coming months. There are some indications of wage growth coming through \u2013 albeit slowly \u2013 as workers\u2019 bargaining power to demand higher pay is lifted by the lowest levels of unemployment since the 1970s, and falling net immigration to the UK reduces the number of people in the workforce. Britain is set to have the worst wage growth of any wealthy nation next year, however, ranking behind Italy, Greece and Hungary at the bottom of 32 OECD countries, as real earnings lag behind inflation. The Resolution Foundation has said the situation will improve toward the end of 2018, although it expects pay will remain flat over the course of the year once inflation is taken into account. There are also worrying signs that Britain\u2019s long jobs boom appears to be over, after an upward curve dating back to early 2012 which the Tories have been able to cheer time and again. Official data is now showing a drop. The number of people in work across Britain fell by 56,000 during the three months to October to stand at just over 32 million. It could get worse, too. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects the unemployment rate to rise over the next five years. Interest rates will stay low Given the uncertainties facing the UK economy as Brexit talks intensify, the Bank of England looks set to sit on its hands in 2018 \u2013 which will help the most hard-pressed households with cheap borrowing costs. At most, interest rates may be nudged higher from 0.50% to 0.75%. Assuming the talks with Brussels don\u2019t lead to any major falls in the pound, the impact from sterling\u2019s devaluation after the Brexit vote on inflation will gradually decline over the course of the year. The Bank has a target of 2% for the consumer price index, and rates are set to fall back gradually in this direction from a peak of 3.1% in November. Should there be a move higher, it will only be limited and gradual, according to the Bank\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, and it should be manageable for most. Just a third of households have a mortgage on their home and the majority have a fixed rate deal, meaning they will not see any immediate change until the term of their mortgage comes to an end. Those feeling the change will only see an increase in debt servicing costs of about \u00a315 a month from a 25 basis point increase in rates, according to a Bank study. One element to watch for as 2018 wears on is Carney\u2019s impending departure in June 2019. City investors and politicians will start to clamour for clarity on his replacement, which could lead to uncertainty over the direction of monetary policy. Borrowers, under pressure because of slow wage growth and the rising cost of living, will need to stay alert.

      "bodyText": "2017 was a year marked by mini-upsets in the business world that, taken together, represented a changing of the old guard and a new establishment taking shape. Technology fuelled a revolution which saw upstarts in retail, manufacturing and finance overtake long-established players. Whether it was payment cards or Bitcoin trumping cash or currencies, or the battery coming of age over the internal combustion engine, these were seminal moments. Maureen Hinton, a director at research firm GlobalData said: \u201cThese disruptors have adapted to new demand and changing lifestyles far quicker than traditional businesses often because they can create from scratch, rather than having to adapt an existing model.\u201d The disruptors made 2017 their own in a good year for the upstart. Asos leapfrogs Marks &amp; Spencer The biggest upset of the year in the UK was in retail. Marks &amp; Spencer, Britain\u2019s favourite clothing retailer, was overtaken last month by Asos, the fashion website still listed on the junior AIM market. This was seen as a pivotal moment on the high street because M&amp;S, which dates back to 1884, was dwarfed by its 17-year-old rival in terms of its stock market value. A month on and the gap is even wider with Asos worth \u00a35.2bn compared with M&amp;S\u2019s \u00a34.9bn. The power of the relatively new online player over such well-established retail royalty is a sign of the times on the high street. Shopping habits have changed. Customers have fallen out of love with tired and dated town-centre shops and there is a growing trend toward buying items online. M&amp;S has struggled in recent years to deliver on-trend designs in women\u2019s clothing from its expensive stores. Asos, which used to be called As Seen on Screen, started out by selling cheap copies of celebrity fashion items, and has carved a niche delivering cheap popular designs to a faithful and growing band of young shoppers. This could not have come at a worse time for M&amp;S\u2019s chief executive, Steve Rowe, who has just cbegun a five-year transformation programme and has promised to bring the company\u2019s clothing business back on track. Aldi overtakes Co-op Store openings and bigger more beautiful premises helped Aldi leapfrog the more established Co-op to become Britain\u2019s fifth largest supermarket. The German upstart, which opened its first UK store in 1990, increased its share of the grocery market from 5.6% to 6.2% in February, compared with the same 12-week period the previous year, according to the market research firm Kantar Worldpanel. This trumped the 6% share controlled by the Co-op, which opened its first self-service store in 1942 and can trace its history back to 1844. Aldi\u2019s rise, along with its smaller rival Lidl, has been something of a phenomenon. Both have turned grocery shopping on its head by selling a limited range of lines. Aldi stores often stock just 1,500 lines compared with as many as 40,000 at the big four supermarkets, and 90% are own brand. Customers pass through its tills 40% faster because it uses checkouts with longer conveyor belts that accommodate the entire contents of a trolley. The items also have bigger bar codes in three different positions, which are more likely to be captured first time when scanned. It is such attention to detail that is behind its success. The Co-op\u2019s market share also diminished because it sold 300 stores to the convenience chain McColl\u2019s last year, and refocused on its own smaller convenience stores rather than bigger supermarkets. This was also the year that Lidl overtook Waitrose to become the UK\u2019s seventh biggest grocer. Just Eat delivers more market value than Sainsbury Still in the consumer space, the takeaway king Just Eat has caused some of Britain\u2019s biggest grocers a bout of indigestion. The fast-food ordering website which makes no products and owns no outlets has now made it into the FTSE100 leading index of top companies. It has gained its hefty valuation simply by creaming cash off orders placed with third party restaurants hosted on its website and apps. Just Eat is now worth \u00a35.6bn compared with Sainsbury\u2019s, which has 1,400 stores and sells 90,000 items and is valued at \u00a35.1bn. Just Eat has very little that differentiates it from rival online fast food consolidators other than scale and brand. It was founded in 2001 by five Danish entrepreneurs and has benefitted from Britons\u2019 love of pizza, burgers and Chinese food. It now operates in 12 countries. Greg Lawless, a retail analyst at broker Shore Capital, says time will tell if valuations of new digital disruptors will bear an abundance of fruit. \u201cFor now investors are happy to pay the premium for innovation and perhaps, a more agile business model, compared to more traditional legacy retailers,\u201d he said. Tesla speeds past Ford As the pioneer of the electric revolution shaking up the gas-guzzling world of cars, Tesla is the poster child for the disruptor movement. It has almost reinvented the automotive industry, leaving the established marques in its slipstream. It is still less than 15 years old and has never made a profit, but the US car maker led by the former Paypal business magnate Elon Musk is now considered more valuable than the Ford Motor Company. This was probably the biggest upset outside the UK. In April investors drove the share price up to \u00a336.6bn just beyond Ford\u2019s \u00a334.3bn value. This was a seminal moment in the automotive world. It signified battery-powered cars coming of age. Most of its rivals are now playing catch-up with electric vehicles of their own, but Tesla is the standard bearer and market leader. It has also coined a phrase. When a disruptor breaks through in another industry it is referred to as a \u201cTesla moment\u201d. Here again the valuation is based on hope. Ford has built more than 350m vehicles and has a proven track record. Tesla has a reputation for missing deadlines and targets and has delivered only 76,230 cars in the last year \u2013 nowhere near Ford\u2019s 6.65m. Even a fatal crash involving one of its vehicles has failed to dent investor enthusiasm. Jeff Bezos topples Bill Gates as world\u2019s richest man When it comes to billionaires Amazon\u2019s CEO is cut from the same cloth as Tesla\u2019s Musk and Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates. All have vision and steely determination. It was only a matter of time before Bezos, who transformed the way we shop and made e-commerce acceptable, would trump Gates as the world\u2019s richest man. The 53-year-old magnate saw his fortune increase to \u00a370bn in April, about \u00a31bn more than the Microsoft billionaire. The moment was brief, however, and related to Amazon\u2019s share price rising by 2.5%. His wealth is linked to the company\u2019s stock and his 17% stake has since slipped in value after Amazon posted a fall in quarterly profits. This is less of a defining moment because the pair\u2019s fortunes are likely to oscillate over the coming years, and the rise of an online retailer over a software giant is less meaningful in terms of disruptor trend. That said Bezos\u2019s rise from small beginnings, selling books from the garage of his Seattle home, is still remarkable. He had shown signs of genius at an even earlier ago, using a screwdriver to dismantle his cot as a four-year-old. Bezos the toddler felt the time had come to upgrade to a bed. While studying in high school, Bezos also showed early foresight in proclaiming that \u201cthe future of mankind is not on this planet.\u201d In 1994 he left his job at a hedge fund after reading about the boom in internet growth. He had drawn up a shortlist of 20 possible ventures and settled on books. Amazon was born. UK card payments overtake cash The value of transactions made using payment cards exceeded those in cash for the first-time last year, according to the British Retail Consortium. Some may have mistakenly thought such a landmark had been reached some years ago, but smaller transactions paid with loose change always accumulated to swing the balance in favour of cash. The innovation of using contactless, where you can wave your card in front of a payment machine without having to enter a pin, has however meant more people are using cards for buying lower value items. Contactless now accounts for a third of all card purchases, up from 10% in October 2015. The introduction of lower transaction fees and handling charges also had an impact. Retailers are now more willing to invest in systems to accept card payments after reduced charges were forced through by the EU under its interchange fee regulation. Cash has always been king, so this shift in balance is a significant moment. Anthony Wagerman, the chief executive of foreign exchange firm Travelex explains why he always had faith cash would prevail. \u201cI remember reading a couple of years ago in a journal \u2013 I think it was The Economist \u2013 that, as long as the beggar or busker on the street had an upturned hat in which passersby were dropping in notes and coins, you knew that cash was still here to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cBut just last week, a friend of mine told me he saw someone begging outside a shop. And in their right hand was a small portable chip and pin machine \u2026 \u201d Bitcoin\u2019s worth more than all UK banknotes and coins in circulation It\u2019s the controversial digital currency that divides opinion over its legitimacy. Earlier this month bitcoin became the world\u2019s sixth most valuable currency in circulation after soaring in value and overtaking sterling. It is a mystery to many because bitcoin is created by computer code and cannot be touched or stored like notes or coins. An anonymous techie using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto created the currency in 2009. Hugely volatile, it came to prominence in 2013 when its value soared by 10,000% before the price crashed. Some believe it is a flash in the pan, but others think it is the next big thing. The only certainty is that there is no certainty when it comes to the future of bitcoin. Its Tesla moment came on 20 December when it was valued at \u00a312,900 or $17,295. It has smashed record after record in 2017, and the value of all bitcoins grew to more than \u00a3134bn or $180bn. The cryptocurrency dwarfed more than half of the world\u2019s currencies in terms of the value of banknotes and coins in circulation. The amount of sterling in circulation is worth \u00a377bn. On 22 December, however, it\u2019s value dropped 30% to $13,155. Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk, or sign up to the daily Business Today email here",

      "body": "<p>2017 was a year marked by mini-upsets in the business world that, taken together, represented a changing of the old guard and a new establishment taking shape.</p> <p>Technology fuelled a revolution which saw upstarts in retail, manufacturing and finance overtake long-established players. Whether it was payment cards or Bitcoin trumping cash or currencies, or the battery coming of age over the internal combustion engine, these were seminal moments.</p> <p>Maureen Hinton, a director at research firm GlobalData said: \u201cThese disruptors have adapted to new demand and changing lifestyles far quicker than traditional businesses often because they can create from scratch, rather than having to adapt an existing model.\u201d</p> <p>The disruptors made 2017 their own in a good year for the upstart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39091e41e35316de71ca67cb1b02079a723759b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39091e41e35316de71ca67cb1b02079a723759b7/0_33_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"M&amp;S store on Oxford Street in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An M&amp;S store on Oxford Street in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Ball/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Asos leapfrogs Marks &amp; Spencer</h2> <p>The biggest upset of the year in the UK was in retail. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/18/asos-overtakes-m-and-s-marks-spencer-uk-high-street-tesla-moment\">Marks &amp; Spencer, Britain\u2019s favourite clothing retailer, was overtaken last month by Asos</a>, the fashion website still listed on the junior AIM market.</p> <p>This was seen as a pivotal moment on the high street because M&amp;S, which dates back to 1884, was dwarfed by its 17-year-old rival in terms of its stock market value. A month on and the gap is even wider with Asos worth \u00a35.2bn compared with M&amp;S\u2019s \u00a34.9bn.</p> <p>The power of the relatively new online player over such well-established retail royalty is a sign of the times on the high street. Shopping habits have changed. Customers have fallen out of love with tired and dated town-centre shops and there is a growing trend toward buying items online.</p> <p>M&amp;S has struggled in recent years to deliver on-trend designs in women\u2019s clothing from its expensive stores.</p> <p>Asos, which used to be called As Seen on Screen, started out by selling cheap copies of celebrity fashion items, and has carved a niche delivering cheap popular designs to a faithful and growing band of young shoppers.</p> <p>This could not have come at a worse time for M&amp;S\u2019s chief executive, Steve Rowe, who has just cbegun a five-year transformation programme and has promised to bring the company\u2019s clothing business back on track.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e68c00957e6921ed024f4951c549b5c6ff1c193\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e68c00957e6921ed024f4951c549b5c6ff1c193/22_0_3457_2075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aldi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Aldi overtakes Co-op</h2> <p>Store openings and bigger more beautiful premises helped <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/07/aldi-uk-fifth-largest-supermarket\">Aldi leapfrog the more established Co-op to become Britain\u2019s fifth largest supermarket</a>. The German upstart, which opened its first UK store in 1990, increased its share of the grocery market from 5.6% to 6.2% in February, compared with the same 12-week period the previous year, according to the market research firm Kantar Worldpanel.</p> <p>This trumped the 6% share controlled by the Co-op, which opened its first self-service store in 1942 and can trace its history back to 1844.</p> <p>Aldi\u2019s rise, along with its smaller rival Lidl, has been something of a phenomenon. Both have turned grocery shopping on its head by selling a limited range of lines. Aldi stores often stock just 1,500 lines compared with as many as 40,000 at the big four supermarkets, and 90% are own brand.</p> <p>Customers pass through its tills 40% faster because it uses checkouts with longer conveyor belts that accommodate the entire contents of a trolley. The items also have bigger bar codes in three different positions, which are more likely to be captured first time when scanned. It is such attention to detail that is behind its success.</p> <p>The Co-op\u2019s market share also diminished because it sold 300 stores to the convenience chain McColl\u2019s last year, and refocused on its own smaller convenience stores rather than bigger supermarkets.</p> <p>This was also the year that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/aug/22/lidl-overtakes-waitrose-uk-grocer-chain-discounters\">Lidl overtook Waitrose</a> to become the UK\u2019s seventh biggest grocer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f887c918546810ef448199356a9692376f541ab9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f887c918546810ef448199356a9692376f541ab9/0_320_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JustEat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Just Eat delivers more market value than Sainsbury</h2> <p>Still in the consumer space, the takeaway king Just Eat has caused some of Britain\u2019s biggest grocers a bout of indigestion. The fast-food ordering website which makes no products and owns no outlets has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/23/just-eat-ftse-100-value-surge\">made it into the FTSE100 leading index of top companies</a>.</p> <p>It has gained its hefty valuation simply by creaming cash off orders placed with third party restaurants hosted on its website and apps. Just Eat is now worth \u00a35.6bn compared with Sainsbury\u2019s, which has 1,400 stores and sells 90,000 items and is valued at \u00a35.1bn.</p> <p>Just Eat has very little that differentiates it from rival online fast food consolidators other than scale and brand. It was founded in 2001 by five Danish entrepreneurs and has benefitted from Britons\u2019 love of pizza, burgers and Chinese food. It now operates in 12 countries.</p> <p>Greg Lawless, a retail analyst at broker Shore Capital, says time will tell if valuations of new digital disruptors will bear an abundance of fruit. \u201cFor now investors are happy to pay the premium for innovation and perhaps, a more agile business model, compared to more traditional legacy retailers,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96dff775945181b8e1abd36ca1ca8a71e1be4bf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96dff775945181b8e1abd36ca1ca8a71e1be4bf1/574_369_2633_1580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesla Roadster 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tesla Roadster 2</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Tesla speeds past Ford</h2> <p>As the pioneer of the electric revolution shaking up the gas-guzzling world of cars, Tesla is the poster child for the disruptor movement. It has almost reinvented the automotive industry, leaving the established marques in its slipstream.</p> <p>It is still less than 15 years old and has never made a profit, but the US car maker led by the former Paypal business magnate Elon Musk <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/04/tesla-charges-ahead-to-overtake-ford-in-market-value\">is now considered more valuable than the Ford Motor Company</a>. This was probably the biggest upset outside the UK.</p> <p>In April investors drove the share price up to \u00a336.6bn just beyond Ford\u2019s \u00a334.3bn value. This was a seminal moment in the automotive world. It signified battery-powered cars coming of age. Most of its rivals are now playing catch-up with electric vehicles of their own, but Tesla is the standard bearer and market leader.</p> <p>It has also coined a phrase. When a disruptor breaks through in another industry it is referred to as a \u201cTesla moment\u201d.</p> <p>Here again the valuation is based on hope. Ford has built more than 350m vehicles and has a proven track record. Tesla has a reputation for missing deadlines and targets and has delivered only 76,230 cars in the last year \u2013 nowhere near Ford\u2019s 6.65m. Even a fatal crash involving one of its vehicles has failed to dent investor enthusiasm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd6e76acf3eecc9f51fb3f3a5c79c41f09138a02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd6e76acf3eecc9f51fb3f3a5c79c41f09138a02/0_99_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos overtakes Bill Gates to Become World\u2019s Richest Person\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amazon\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Jeff Bezos topples Bill Gates as world\u2019s richest man</h2> <p>When it comes to billionaires Amazon\u2019s CEO is cut from the same cloth as Tesla\u2019s Musk and Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates. All have vision and steely determination.</p> <p>It was only a matter of time before Bezos, who transformed the way we shop and made e-commerce acceptable, would <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/27/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-worlds-richest-man-bill-gates\">trump Gates as the world\u2019s richest man</a>.</p> <p>The 53-year-old magnate saw his fortune increase to \u00a370bn in April, about \u00a31bn more than the Microsoft billionaire.</p> <p>The moment was brief, however, and related to Amazon\u2019s share price rising by 2.5%. His wealth is linked to the company\u2019s stock and his 17% stake has since slipped in value after Amazon posted a fall in quarterly profits.</p> <p>This is less of a defining moment because the pair\u2019s fortunes are likely to oscillate over the coming years, and the rise of an online retailer over a software giant is less meaningful in terms of disruptor trend.</p> <p>That said Bezos\u2019s rise from small beginnings, selling books from the garage of his Seattle home, is still remarkable. He had shown signs of genius at an even earlier ago, using a screwdriver to dismantle his cot as a four-year-old. Bezos the toddler felt the time had come to upgrade to a bed.</p> <p>While studying in high school, Bezos also showed early foresight in proclaiming that \u201cthe future of mankind is not on this planet.\u201d In 1994 he left his job at a hedge fund after reading about the boom in internet growth. He had drawn up a shortlist of 20 possible ventures and settled on books. Amazon was born.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c94a1d82ac9841368a6d664c66a2fe0b91e6b2d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c94a1d82ac9841368a6d664c66a2fe0b91e6b2d2/24_170_3765_2262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers Pay With Contactless Cards\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers pay with contactless cards.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>UK card payments overtake cash</h2> <p>The value of transactions made using <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jul/12/cash-contactless-payments-uk-stores-cards-british-retail-consortium\">payment cards exceeded those in cash for the first-time last year</a>, according to the British Retail Consortium.</p> <p>Some may have mistakenly thought such a landmark had been reached some years ago, but smaller transactions paid with loose change always accumulated to swing the balance in favour of cash.</p> <p>The innovation of using contactless, where you can wave your card in front of a payment machine without having to enter a pin, has however meant more people are using cards for buying lower value items. Contactless now accounts for a third of all card purchases, up from 10% in October 2015.</p> <p>The introduction of lower transaction fees and handling charges also had an impact. Retailers are now more willing to invest in systems to accept card payments after reduced charges were forced through by the EU under its interchange fee regulation.</p> <p>Cash has always been king, so this shift in balance is a significant moment. Anthony Wagerman, the chief executive of foreign exchange firm Travelex explains why he always had faith cash would prevail.</p> <p>\u201cI remember reading a couple of years ago in a journal \u2013 I think it was The Economist \u2013 that, as long as the beggar or busker on the street had an upturned hat in which passersby were dropping in notes and coins, you knew that cash was still here to stay,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut just last week, a friend of mine told me he saw someone begging outside a shop.

Berkeley Homes, which builds 4,000 homes a year, is planning to create a facility in Kent next year where builders will work to produce up to 1,000 houses and apartments annually which will then be craned on to sites. Another company, nHouse, is setting up a factory in Peterborough with the capacity to build 400 homes a year, complete with light fittings, bathrooms, bookshelves and kitchens. Production is expected to start in January. It claims it can build a house in 20 days in the factory which can then be erected on site in half a day. Several other developers, including Legal and General and Urban Splash, have also launched prefab home divisions. Fears of a shortage of skilled construction workers caused by an ageing workforce and an exodus due to Brexit are part of the reason for the revival of prefabrication, which last provided a significant number of homes after the second world war. The government has set a target of building 300,000 homes a year by the middle of the next decade. Despite recent increases in activity, the last annual figure was 190,000.

A three-bed house is on sale to developers or individual householders from \u00a3170,000 to \u00a3185,000, which is about the same price as a standard house built using wet trades.

Indeed, my contemporaries and I often find ourselves observing that this or that latest invention could have come straight out of Huxley\u2019s nightmare vision. Given the reaction against the ill-effects of globalisation by those who have been left behind \u2013 but not left out of electoral and referendum polling booths \u2013 it was a clever idea of the British economist Stephen D King to produce a book earlier this year entitled Grave New World. The \u201cD\u201d distinguishes him from the bestselling novelist Stephen King, although I gather that the former is occasionally asked to sign copies of the latter\u2019s thrillers. Well, this book is a different sort of thriller. Its subtitle warns of The End of Globalisation, The Return of History. Other economists and politicians take the existence of the globalised economy as a fact, and not something that can be reversed: only, it is hoped, modified to work better for those who lost out. But this is certainly a forcefully argued book. Be that as it may. What particularly intrigued me on a re-reading were the topical and poignant references to the implications of \u2013 you know what \u2013 Brexit, if it is not stopped, and King\u2019s references to the vision of Huxley\u2019s contemporary George Orwell. King warns: \u201cAs the US loses its appetite for supporting the global institutions that have established \u2018the rules of the game\u2019, it is not impossible to imagine that the 21st century will increasingly be characterised by Nineteen Eighty-Four-style superpower rivalry, with Oceania dominated by the US, Eurasia by Russia and East Asia by China.\u201d What would happen to western Europe if Brexit went ahead? King speculates about the re-emergence of the \u201cold fault lines\u201d. In this context he asks opponents of the European Union to explain \u201chow a divided Europe would more easily cope with a nervous Russian bear next door, particularly if Washington becomes increasingly isolationist\u201d. These are deep waters. Of more immediate concern is the damage being wreaked already by the mere prospect of Brexit. While the British government fools around, Michel Barnier continues to play by the book. He never, to my knowledge, threatened that Britain would be punished \u2013 that story was typical of the fake news favoured by Brexiters. But he did say there would be consequences, and they are now piling up. Cherry-picking and having your cake and eating it are not on the menu, and never have been. The short-term consequences of Brexit were exaggerated by George Osborne when he was still at the Treasury. The chancellor who was so proud of handing budget forecasts over to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility did not apply this discipline to forecasts of the referendum\u2019s immediate impact. The result was that the Brexiters could claim that, with exception of the forecasts for the pound \u2013 a swift and large devaluation \u2013 the Treasury\u2019s forecasts were misleading, and that the immediate damage was not as bad as the more excitable Remainers had predicted. However, these effects occur with time lags, and the damage is beginning to show. The Bank of England has been refreshingly forthright on the prospective losses; so have the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. And Chris Giles, the economics editor of the Financial Times, has analysed the results of a series of independent studies. One of the main findings is that the referendum result has already cost the UK close to 1% of GDP, with consumer spending hit by the devaluation of the pound, and business investment by the lack of confidence caused by the prospect of Brexit and the government\u2019s chaotic handling of the affair. Curiously enough, the estimated hit to the economy already amounts to \u00a3350m a week, remarkably similar to the figure of so-called benefits to the NHS that were promised on the sides of the notorious Brexit bus. The Financial Times estimates that: \u201cThis post-referendum loss of economic output also implies a reduction of about \u00a39bn in fiscal revenue. This drop will increase in the years ahead.\u201d This when years of unnecessary austerity have severely damaged many of our public services. And the Brexiters should have been careful about what they wished for: essential services are already threatened by a collapse in immigration from the rest of the EU. It is interesting that Lord Heseltine, a former cabinet minister with decades of experience of industry and commerce, said last week that Brexit would be more damaging than a Labour government: \u201cWell, we have survived Labour governments before. Their damage tends to be short-term and capable of rectification. Brexit is not short-term and not easily capable of rectification.\u201d My youngest daughter gave me a sweater that proclaimed: \u201cAll I want for Christmas is EU.\u201d Out of date already? No: I have not given up hope and am keeping it for next Christmas. Meanwhile, Happy New Year!",

Still, that is precisely the type of unrecognised corporate achievement that the Observer\u2019s Business Agenda Awards are designed to celebrate. At this year\u2019s lunch the committee again cogitated over some tricky decisions \u2013 and over whether to risk sampling the Tesco turkey main course. The judging panel was made up of a number of familiar faces former Co-op Bank chairman Rev Paul Flowers (who also said grace), rogue trader Nick Leeson and former banking knight Fred Goodwin. A special mention goes to Sir Philip Green, for his sterling work as the luncheon\u2019s sommelier. The Michael Fish crystal ball for rubbish forecasting This has always been a keenly contested category, with economists, City analysts, newspaper columnists and bookies all possessing outstanding capabilities for supplying predictions that last about as long as a tin of Quality Street at Christmas. Still, while experts from all of those trades called the 2017 election result totally incorrectly, the betting industry compounded this by also managing to completely misread much more. A day before polling day, Betfair gave a Tory Westminster majority an 81% chance of occurring and opined \u201cit looks unlikely we will have another upset on our hands\u201d. Meanwhile, throughout 2017 the bookmaking industry\u2019s own forecasters appeared oblivious to which way the wind was blowing with regard to problem gamblers and fixed-odds betting terminals. Therefore, this year\u2019s gong goes to the gambling industry (as it has probably failed to foresee). The Oliver Hardy chipped vase for another fine mess Awarded to the executive who has displayed the most impressive all-round grasp of calamity, the 2017 chipped vase was an easy decision for the awards committee. Iain Conn, the boss of British Gas owner Centrica, began 2017 with a \u00a39.5m fine for IT failures at British Gas, but he soon got into his stride and ran off with this category by being in the vicinity for a quite sensational sequence of corporate accidents. This year also saw a high court finding that Rolls-Royce had been aware of corruption allegations within the company in 2010, but decided not to notify the Serious Fraud Office (Conn was the senior independent director in 2010 and a director from 2005 to 2014). Then there was the bombshell of an accounting scandal at the Italian arm of BT Group (Conn sits on the audit committee), plus the catastrophe at Centrica in November, when the group\u2019s shares had their biggest daily fall after British Gas said it had lost almost 6% of its customers in three months. Following Conn\u2019s stellar run, the committee will consider retiring this award, and handing him the vase in perpetuity. The Gerald Ratner cut-glass sherry decanter Handed to the company with the best line in turning punters against its own products. This year: Tesco. Its Willow Farms brand of chicken is badged as \u201cexclusively for Tesco\u201d, but it emerged in September that it is actually the same meat sold more cheaply in other supermarkets, such as Lidl. So was the claim on the Tesco packaging withdrawn? Not a bit of it. Dave Lewis, the supermarket\u2019s boss, justified the tag thus: \u201cWe don\u2019t see [the exclusive tag] at all as dishonest. The Willow Farms brand is only available inside Tesco.\u201d Or, as the lawyer to its supplier put it: \u201cThe Willow Farms brand is exclusive to Tesco, but the raw material is not\u201d. The Derek Edward Trotter vial of snake oil There has long been a suspicion in the City that the PR industry might, occasionally, try to get clients to buy services it may not be expert in \u2013 such as crisis communications. But 2017 provided the perfect case study for one major firm to demonstrate the value of a supposed expertise in this domain. The PR firm Bell Pottinger was plunged into a crisis of its own in South Africa, after it was alleged to have used racially charged phrases such as \u201cwhite monopoly capital\u201d and \u201ceconomic apartheid\u201d to draw attention away from its wealthy client the Gupta family, which had been accused of benefiting financially from its links to President Jacob Zuma. Having been unable to communicate its way out of that crisis \u2013 the agency disintegrated \u2013 its founder Lord Bell then tried to showcase his own skills by agreeing to be interviewed on Newsnight. It was, to use the technical PR term, a complete car crash. The Travis Bickle replica silver revolver A new award that in its first year fittingly goes to another Travis \u2013 Kalanick \u2013 who, as founder of ride-hailing service Uber, just about qualifies as a taxi driver seemingly intent on self-destruction. He was forced out as chief of Uber in 2017, after a string of disasters, including being filmed berating a driver who was complaining about the difficulty of making a living on Uber\u2019s falling rates. Still, that was nothing compared to the former employee who published a blogpost describing a workplace rife with gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Uber\u2019s year did not improve much from there, either. In September Transport for London (TfL) stripped the company of its licence to operate in the UK capital. Developing. The Alfred Hitchcock violin case The Hitchcock award is doled out to the business executive whom the committee believes has excelled themselves with the year\u2019s most pointless cameo. In what was a stellar field, the judges wanted to congratulate the quality of a string of 2017 nominations. Particular mention was given to the former Goldman Sachs financier Anthony Scaramucci, whose 10-day tenure as Donald Trump\u2019s communications director elevated the global debate, particularly by producing one of the more memorable soundbites to emerge from that great office: \u201cI\u2019m not Steve Bannon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to suck my own cock.\u201d Still, however highbrow Scaramucci\u2019s work was, he was eventually eclipsed in this category by a cameo so fleeting, it is arguable whether it occurred at all. Kevin Cummings, the chief executive designate of GKN, wins the award after being ousted as the boss of the FTSE 100 aerospace and engineering firm weeks before he was due to take up the top position. The Microsoft patch for system crashes The judges were impressed by one particular IT shutdown, which led to chaos at British Airways and was caused by an \u201cuncontrolled return of power\u201d, following an outage, that physically damaged some servers at its data centre. Flights were cancelled, tens of thousands of passengers were affected \u2013 while the airline busied itself by implausibly arguing that the incident \u201cwas not an IT failure\u201d but \u201can electrical power supply which was interrupted\u201d (which then, er, caused the IT to fail). BA was accused of greed by the GMB union, which said the issue could have been prevented if the airline had not cut the jobs of \u201chundreds of dedicated and loyal\u201d IT staff and contracted the work to India last year. British Airways\u2019 chief executive, Alex Cruz, insisted the outsourcing of jobs was not to blame for the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d power failure. Still, it would be churlish to deny him his gong.",

      "bodyText": "The patterns of global trade are moving into a new era, except that they look like a re-run of a terrible past. It\u2019s not so much a concern about the rise of isolationist nation states \u2013 ones that put protectionist trade policies before the world\u2019s economic health. The fear must be that trade reverts to the 19th-century rulebook that rewarded the countries with the most muscle and bargaining power. Donald Trump is an obvious symbol of this shift. The US president\u2019s policies promote trade that ignores or bypasses the rules of fair play established following the second world war. Instead, trade becomes a tool of the richest and most powerful nations. His determination to drive a hard bargain with Canada and Mexico in talks about a revised Nafta free trade deal was one of the first signs. His aim is to elevate the US above its neighbours, which are no longer seen as partners, but rivals. This new approach emanates from his America First agenda, which is expected to come to the fore in the new year now his domestic tax bill has bludgeoned its way through Congress. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, is another leader who puts his country\u2019s self-interest above the development of a fairer system of trade. Modi, like President Xi Jinping of China, has argued that he has little choice but to play tough when he needs to raise millions of people out of poverty every year. Without firm control on which foreign companies are permitted access to their markets, how can they maintain political stability? In the same vein, China\u2019s re-invention of the Silk Road, through Asia and the Middle East to Europe, harks back to a time when the world\u2019s largest economies used their buying power to amass disproportionate gains from trade. Brexit is undoubtedly a manifestation of this trend. Many of those who support leaving the European Union\u2019s single market and customs union believe the UK will enjoy greater leverage in its dealings with the rest of the world as a result. They point to the UK\u2019s relationships with the Middle East, Latin America and those parts of eastern Europe beyond the EU\u2019s boundaries as examples of thriving economies ripe to be exploited by British exporters. The UK trade minister, Liam Fox, was in Argentina at the World Trade Organisation\u2019s latest gathering. It finished on 13 December, having made, by most accounts, little progress in widening the boundaries of fair trade. Fox talks about maintaining the WTO\u2019s rules and possibly relying on them to make sure Britain gains access to new markets. Most of his efforts, though, are focused on preparing the ground for bilateral deals with individual countries in the hope that what the UK has to sell \u2013 in its sophistication and competitive price \u2013 will entice them to offer favourable terms. This is a dog-eat-dog world in which only those countries with the leverage of large populations and something precious to sell will thrive. And it is a gamble when Fox says that the UK services industry (much of it foreign-owned), and its manufacturers (many of them run from the US and Germany) will outdo their rivals and bring profit to the UK. Maybe they will repatriate the gains if the corporation tax rate is low enough. Maybe they will stay headquartered in the UK if the authorities turn a blind eye to the financial inducements sometimes necessary to win trade deals. Corruption is certainly an acute problem in some of the countries that Fox mentions he wants to deal with, especially when the UK has lost the leverage offered by EU membership. The EU is an economic fortress that imposes its fair share of restrictive practices. But EU members are the most likely to maintain an ethical path in trading activities the return to 19th-century practices. Electric cars are starting to fuel real debate about generating tax Electric cars may account for a drop in the oily ocean of the world\u2019s combustion-engine-powered fleet, but the speed of their take-up is a match for the breathtaking acceleration of a Tesla. Five years ago, a little more than 100,000 electric cars were sold worldwide annually. Fast forward to this year and more than 1 million were sold, taking the cumulative total whizzing past the milestone of 3 million globally. If 2017 was the year when the planet woke up to electric cars, with major manufacturers vying to outdo each other with their ambitions and governments pledging to phase out petrol and diesel cars, 2018 will be the year they begin to shake the world. Oil companies have already been reassuring investors that electric cars won\u2019t eat their lunch. The new year will see them reiterating their case, against a backdrop of rising oil prices that are good news for their short-term profits \u2013 but could be bad news in the long term as they make electric cars look more attractive. In the UK, the pressure that electric cars are putting on power grids will begin to emerge as an issue. While energy network firms say they haven\u2019t yet been troubled by hotspots of battery-powered cars charging simultaneously, they are expecting such clusters to emerge soon in affluent areas. One energy boss warned last week that some drivers should pay extra if they want to charge up at peak times, putting extra stress on networks. On the flipside, 2018 will see the start of innovative trials where households with electric cars return power to the grid, too. The market share being taken by electric cars \u2013 expected to be 40% in countries such as Norway next year \u2013 also heralds vital debates around taxation. Fuel duty from petrol and diesel earned the Treasury \u00a327.6bn in 2015-16, three times as much as tobacco duties. So a real public discussion needs to start on what comes next as those revenues decline. Road pricing, perhaps? Unsurprisingly, the government seems increasingly amenable to that idea. Don\u2019t feel sorry for Goldman \u2013 tax reform is a big bonus Has everyone got their tiny gold-plated violins at the ready? Good, because investment banking giant Goldman Sachs \u2013 famed for its extravagant bonuses and ruthless deal-making acumen \u2013 says its fourth-quarter profits will take a $5bn hit as a result of president Donald Trump\u2019s tax reforms. The one-off charge is largely down to a change in the way that overseas earnings of US firms are taxed. But anyone cheering the prospect of an increased tax contribution from Wall Street shouldn\u2019t pop the cork on their magnum of Krug just yet. In the long term, banks are expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries from Trump\u2019s overhaul, announced just before Christmas, which will significantly reduce rates of tax on US corporations. Undoubtedly, Goldman and its Wall Street neighbours will be grateful to two of the key architects of the reforms in the Trump administration \u2013 the bank\u2019s former executives Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn. Now that\u2019s what you call a happy new year.",
