From 20 October, the largest dimensions of the two existing small parcel formats will be combined to create a single, bigger format measuring 45cm x 35cm x 16cm, saving up to \u00a35.20 if the contents of a medium parcel can be fitted into the new small format. Royal Mail, which handles more parcels in the UK than any other company, is also running a Christmas price promotion on small parcels from 20 October until 18 January. Under the promotion, all second-class small parcels weighing up to 2kg will cost the same, \u00a32.80. This will knock \u00a31 off parcels weighing between 1kg and 2kg. Franked small parcels weighing between 1kg and 2kg will also benefit from a saving of \u00a31 at \u00a32.50 during the period of the promotion. First-class prices are remaining the same: \u00a33.20 for a small parcel weighing up to 1kg and \u00a35.45 for 1-2kg. Last month, Royal Mail launched a pilot of Sunday afternoon opening at around 100 of its delivery offices across the UK to make it easier for online shoppers not at home during the week to get their parcels. The initiative extends the opening of delivery offices with the highest parcel volumes to seven days a week. Royal Mail also began a trial of Sunday deliveries to addresses within the M25. MPs on the business select committee have launched an inquiry into claims that Royal Mail will struggle to fulfil its universal service obligation to deliver to every address in the country six days a week for the same price due to intense competition in profitable areas. Royal Mail is worried that rival operator Whistl, formerly known as TNT Post, is able to cherry-pick profitable delivery routes in big cities, while Royal Mail is legally required to provide the same service to all 29m UK addresses.",

    "webTitle": "Morrisons to launch more price cuts in first salvo of \u2018tough\u2019 Christmas contest", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Morrisons will launch more price cuts and promotions before Christmas, chief executive Dalton Philips promised, as part of the embattled supermarket chain\u2019s fightback against the discounters. The planned price cuts come after Morrisons last week revealed a loyalty scheme through which it will return cash to shoppers if they could have got a better deal at Aldi and Lidl or big rivals Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s. It is the first time a major grocer has promised to price match against the discounters. Philips admitted the scheme will be costly and analysts say it is too complex \u2013 involving points and payback rather than just cheaper shelf prices \u2013 to be a real winner with shoppers. But Philips insisted the price-matching scheme can be a \u201cgamechanger\u201d in reassuring shoppers they do not have to go elsewhere. Philips added Morrisons still has capacity to cut prices further ahead of what he said will be a \u201ctough\u201d Christmas for the supermarkets. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a relentless focus on making sure our customers don\u2019t need to shop anywhere else and on taking big, bold decisions.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are taking prices down. We have already reduced prices on a couple of thousand items. We raised prices on about 300 lines but our competitors raised prices on about 2,000. We are continuing to reduce the cost of a shopping basket.\u201d Big promotions will also be rolled out alongside the new loyalty scheme, although Philips would not confirm whether Morrisons would repeat its usual Christmas voucher promotions. While consumer confidence is rising, unemployment is falling and saving rates and house prices are going up, Philips said that supermarkets were not enjoying the benefits of economic green shoots because shopper\u2019s spending power remains under pressure. \u201cAfter years of austerity, it is going to be difficult in the food market. If customers have got a bit extra cash I can see them spending it on non-food. After so many years not being able to upgrade their sofa or TV, any extra pennies will go there.\u201d The big supermarkets are facing the toughest period in decades. Shoppers have reined in the number of items they buy at a time when the cost of major food commodities is also falling and a change in shopping habits is battering out-of-town supermarkets. In March, Philips already announced plans to halve profits to shave \u00a31bn off costs in order to cut prices. Market analysts Kantar Worldpanel said there had been an improvement in sales in August and September. \u201cWe definitely have seen a turn. We\u2019ve seen a very positive summer. If you look at the Kantar figures over the summer we are firmly back in the pack and, depending how you cut the numbers, in many cases we are right at the top of the pack,\u201d Philips said. However, he admitted that traditional retailers are is still under attack and losing sales to the discounters. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying this for a long time and we put a deliberate plan in place, we halved our profits. There are big structural changes going on. We have recognised it and are dealing with it, but we are on a journey that is going to take time because when you lower prices you also lower top-line sales.\u201d With Morrisons shares at an 11-year low, the company could be viewed as vulnerable. Earlier this year members of the Morrison family were rumoured to be trying to enlist private equity backers for a takeover. Philips said that Morrisons is clearly different from its rivals in that it owns its own food processors \u2013 such as fruit packers, farms and abattoirs. \u201cWe have got a very strong balance sheet. We own all our stores at a time you wouldn\u2019t want to be paying leases for 25 years. We have a fully funded pension scheme and have significant opportunity to take further costs out. We recognised as a board the trends and adapted and have been bold. We are very confident we have a place in UK retail,\u201d Philips said.",

      "body": "<p>Morrisons will launch more price cuts and promotions before Christmas, chief executive Dalton Philips promised, as part of the embattled supermarket chain\u2019s fightback against the discounters.</p> <p>The planned price cuts come after Morrisons last week revealed a loyalty scheme through which it will return cash to shoppers if they could have got a better deal at Aldi and Lidl or big rivals Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s. It is the first time a major grocer has promised to price match against the discounters.</p> <p>Philips admitted the scheme will be costly and analysts say it is too complex \u2013 involving points and payback rather than just cheaper shelf prices \u2013 to be a real winner with shoppers. But Philips insisted the price-matching scheme can be a \u201cgamechanger\u201d in reassuring shoppers they do not have to go elsewhere. Philips added Morrisons still has capacity to cut prices further ahead of what he said will be a \u201ctough\u201d Christmas for the supermarkets.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a relentless focus on making sure our customers don\u2019t need to shop anywhere else and on taking big, bold decisions.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cWe are taking prices down. We have already reduced prices on a couple of thousand items. We raised prices on about 300 lines but our competitors raised prices on about 2,000. We are continuing to reduce the cost of a shopping basket.\u201d</p> <p>Big promotions will also be rolled out alongside the new loyalty scheme, although Philips would not confirm whether Morrisons would repeat its usual Christmas voucher promotions.</p> <p>While consumer confidence is rising, unemployment is falling and saving rates and house prices are going up, Philips said that supermarkets were not enjoying the benefits of economic green shoots because shopper\u2019s spending power remains under pressure.</p> <p>\u201cAfter years of austerity, it is going to be difficult in the food market. If customers have got a bit extra cash I can see them spending it on non-food. After so many years not being able to upgrade their sofa or TV, any extra pennies will go there.\u201d</p> <p>The big supermarkets are facing the toughest period in decades. Shoppers have reined in the number of items they buy at a time when the cost of major food commodities is also falling and a change in shopping habits is battering out-of-town supermarkets.</p> <p>In March, Philips already announced plans to halve profits to shave \u00a31bn off costs in order to cut prices. Market analysts Kantar Worldpanel said there had been an improvement in sales in August and September.</p> <p>\u201cWe definitely have seen a turn. We\u2019ve seen a very positive summer. If you look at the Kantar figures over the summer we are firmly back in the pack and, depending how you cut the numbers, in many cases we are right at the top of the pack,\u201d Philips said.</p> <p>However, he admitted that traditional retailers are is still under attack and losing sales to the discounters. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying this for a long time and we put a deliberate plan in place, we halved our profits. There are big structural changes going on. We have recognised it and are dealing with it, but we are on a journey that is going to take time because when you lower prices you also lower top-line sales.\u201d</p> <p>With Morrisons shares at an 11-year low, the company could be viewed as vulnerable. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/12/morrisons-private-equity-buyout-talk-sir-ken-morrison\" title=\"\">Earlier this year members of the Morrison family were rumoured to be trying to enlist private equity backers for a takeover</a>.</p> <p>Philips said that Morrisons is clearly different from its rivals in that it owns its own food processors \u2013 such as fruit packers, farms and abattoirs. \u201cWe have got a very strong balance sheet. We own all our stores at a time you wouldn\u2019t want to be paying leases for 25 years. We have a fully funded pension scheme and have significant opportunity to take further costs out. We recognised as a board the trends and adapted and have been bold. We are very confident we have a place in UK retail,\u201d Philips said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A scientist has created a budget device that can control a computer by tracking eye movement after stumbling on a \u00a39.95 web camera being sold with a games console \u2013 a huge saving from the \u00a320,000 that a similar apparatus used for medical research would have cost at the time. German neuroscientist Dr Aldo Faisal was setting up a laboratory at Imperial College in London when he made the chance discovery. Faisal and his team reconfigured two of the cameras and fixed them to a harness which attaches to the head, making a \u00a343 device that opens up the use of computers to the 6 million people in the UK with restricted hand movement. The cameras tell a computer where the user is looking, allowing a cursor to be moved around a screen while a wink enables the click of a mouse. While eye tracking had been done before, the team showed that it could be achieved at a fraction of the cost and could eventually lead to such devices being sold in shops. Earlier this year, similar technology was used to produce a wheelchair that could be controlled using the eyes. The user can talk while the software detects where they want to go via a \u00a3120 eye-tracking bar usually employed to see if people are looking at advertisements. The software can distinguish between when the user is looking around and when they want to move and the wheelchair responds within 10 milliseconds. \u201cIt may not be the best hardware to do the job but we have by now such good software algorithms that can do data analytics and data processing that you put the intelligence into the software and not the hardware,\u201d Faisal said. \u201cThat is really the transformative thing. So a lot of biomedical engineering devices to help people [are] focused on the hardware \u2013 better sensors, better pumps \u2013 but most of the time it is how you control stuff, how you analyse the stuff that allows you to do things well.\u201d Faisal\u2019s lab straddles bioengineering and computing and works to unravel how the brain functions and subsequently how this knowledge can be applied to devices assisting people with restricted mobility. His discoveries could help amputees, people with paralysis, those with arthritis, and the aged to be more mobile. Since the control of the eye comes straight from the brain, injuries to the spinal cord or amputations do not affect eye movements, said Faisal. Parkinson\u2019s disease can affect eye movements but a device can still be controlled while multiple sclerosis also has little effect for these purposes, he says. \u201cThe actual power of the eye-based user interfaces we build is not actually in the cheap hardware, it just shows that it works on very cheap hardware. \u201cWhat no one has done is build decoders which tell what is your intention of action based on how you look at the world and that is what we are really doing. We are building systems which, based on your eye movement behaviour, try and work out what you are going to do next.\u201d A robot arm which is also directed by eye movement has also been developed at the lab. Faisal compares the budget developments to the human brain. \u201cIt is incredibly unreliable in each individual piece so the hardware is really crappy. Our eyes are not particularly amazing. Most of our senses are not amazing. But yet together the whole [thing] works extremely well and extremely reliably and that is because our brain runs amazing software so that\u2019s why I think that it is the smart software and not the expensive devices which can really turn things around,\u201d said Faisal. Using the eyes as a way to instruct a computer would also be a non-invasive way around a problem, he says. Research has found that people with prosthetic arms take them off before they take off their shoes when they return home, as they are \u201cso unnatural, so alien\u201d. When a version of Faisal\u2019s video game was brought to an exhibition, 70% of people who tried it could use it after 15 seconds of calibration. \u201cIf we can build a device which works out what you want to do not based upon spending a lot of time working out how you think but simply based upon rules that are given by how the brain works in all of us, I can build devices which just work,\u201d Faisal said. Cheap widely available eye-tracking devices could be on the market in between two and five years, according to Faisal, who is working on plans to commercialise his work. As society gets older, there will be an increased need for such devices, he says. Future developments could also help those with dementia, meaning a person with the conditionrecalling an event may have difficulty with specific memories of it. A device \u2013 like a pair of glasses or a contact lens \u2013 would detect through the eye what they are trying to recall and feed them images in order to help them with the memory, said Faisal. \u201cIt is trying to see how far we can push these non-invasive technologies that decode your intention and make things more interactive and easier,\u201d he said. Eye-controlled wheelchair: how it works The eye-controlled wheelchair centres on developments which can separate eye movements used when talking to the eye movements employed when navigating. The team built software to exploit the differences and put it to use in the prototype wheelchair, using a commercially available eye tracker in a black plastic bar more usually witnessed in advertising. This created what Faisal says is the first device that allows the user to talk and navigate at the same time, without fully focusing on controlling the device.",
