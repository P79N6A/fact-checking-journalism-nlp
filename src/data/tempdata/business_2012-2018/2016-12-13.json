      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison is selling the benefits of debt as a vital source of capital in an attempt to justify Australia\u2019s borrowings, in the lead-up to decisions by rating agencies that may see it lose its coveted triple-A credit rating. The Turnbull government is prepared to take on \u201cgood debt\u201d to invest in infrastructure once \u201cbad debt\u201d for recurrent spending is under control, the treasurer will tell the Australasian Finance and Banking Conference on Wednesday. The pro-debt rhetoric contrasts with claims by the Abbott government that Australia faces a \u201cdebt and deficit disaster\u201d, when the absolute level of debt and not its uses were the focus of the government\u2019s economic case. But Labor has used the threat that ratings agencies may downgrade Australia\u2019s triple-A rating after the mid-year economic update next week to call for the government to ditch its proposed $48bn company tax cut package. Morrison will tell the conference that Australia needs foreign borrowing to pay for a current account deficit that averages 4% a year, and to satisfy its high demand for capital. \u201cAustralia\u2019s current account deficit is because there are more investment opportunities than can be covered by domestic capital,\u201d Morrison will say. Foreign capital is a \u201cmust have, not a nice to have\u201d because it underpins economic growth and employment. The treasurer claims Australia has low levels of public debt but accepts they are high \u201cby historical and by Coalition government standards\u201d. Morrison will say attracting foreign debt is \u201cvital for this country\u201d but accept there are concerns its current levels threaten the triple-A rating. \u201cOnce borrowing for recurrent expenditure is under control, we will have more headroom to take on and deploy so-called good debt. \u201cThis is debt used for investment purposes that increases productivity and produced future income.\u201d The Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that national debt is projected to rise to $428.5bn (22.6% of gross domestic product) in 2018-19. And Deloitte Access Economics has warned the federal budget deficit is projected to expand by another $24.3bn over the next four years. Before Monday\u2019s mid year economic update, Morrison has admitted that the federal budget may not return to balance by 2020-21 as planned. Several ratings agencies have warned the government if budget savings are stymied Australia could lose its triple A credit rating. But Morrison will tell the conference on Wednesday the government has already \u201cbested expectations\u201d on fiscal consolidation set by the agencies. \u201cWe have already cut the rate of spending growth from 4.2%, as it was under the former Labor government, to around 1.5%.\u201d Morrison will trumpet $21bn of budget savings over four years that had already passed the parliament and call for the opposition to pass further savings. \u201cYou could be forgiven for thinking Labor are already sabotaging the budget, to undermine Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating for their own political gain.\u201d Morrison will also claim Australia needs to have a more competitive company tax rate, lobbying for the government\u2019s plan to reduce the rate to 25% over 10 years. Labor\u2019s finance spokesman, Jim Chalmers, has warned the government can\u2019t keep both its $48bn tax cut plan and the triple A credit rating. \u201cThis government is failing the three tests it set for itself: the economy is shrinking, full time jobs are disappearing, and the deficits are growing,\u201d he said. Chalmers said the government should also pursue Labor\u2019s alternative revenue measures, including changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax. \u201cIf they choose not to go down this path they are choosing to jeopardise the AAA rating and risk higher mortgage repayments for middle Australia.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hurrah, some of the world\u2019s largest banks have been rounded up to underwrite a \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) rights issue at the giant Italian lender UniCredit. This is unequivocally good short-term news for Italy and the European banking system since the alternative would have been an immediate crisis for both. Yet, eight years after the global banking crash, Italian and European banking regulators should hang their heads in shame that a bank the size of UniCredit should require such a large infusion of fresh capital. This is UniCredit\u2019s third fundraising since 2008, a damning statistic. Do it once and do it properly, says the old rule of refinancing. In Italy\u2019s case, the authorities pretended that time would wash away a slug of the bad loans in the system. Instead, in a stagnant Italian economy, the rot spread. A sum of \u20ac13bn does, at least, give UniCredit the chance to give its pipes a proper rinse. Provisions will be increased by \u20ac8.1bn and a \u20ac17.7bn portfolio of bad loans will be sold off. In parallel, around 14,000 jobs will be cut over three years in an attempt to make cost ratios vaguely competitive. At the end of the process, sometime in 2019, UniCredit will emerge with a return on equity of 9%, says chief executive Jean-Pierre Mustier. That would be a big improvement on the current position but may imply that UniCredit won\u2019t achieve returns greater than its cost of capital. That\u2019s just modern reality, Mustier argues, correctly: the days of chasing 20% returns are over for all banks. The more important measure is capital strength and, if UniCredit can get to a core ratio of 12.5% in 2019, it will be back in land of the respectable. The self-help plan seems bold enough to ensure that the fundraising will succeed in January without the need to call on the underwriters; there are only a few weeks to wait, and Italy won\u2019t be holding any more referendums. But UniCredit\u2019s drawn-out saga does not inspire bullish thoughts about Italy\u2019s ability to tackle its many economic and financial woes within the eurozone. A radical plan for the bank has emerged only after years of delay, and stragglers such as Monte dei Paschi di Siena still await their fate. Meanwhile, the restructurings \u2013 as opposed to the immediate fundraisings \u2013 will require work over many years to succeed. The backdrop is high unemployment, low growth and the rise of eurosceptic parties. Crisis over? Hardly. Unanswered questions at M&amp;S One of Robert Swannell\u2019s contributions to Marks &amp; Spencer is secure for all time. In 2004, as a supremely well-connected City investment banker, he led the advisory team that helped save M&amp;S from Sir Philip Green\u2019s attempted takeover. The nation gives thanks. The Green episode, however, saddled all subsequent M&amp;S chief executives and chairmen with a benchmark for success. Green\u2019s offer, which never technically materialised (a bit like his promise to \u201csort\u201d the BHS pensions deficit), was pitched at 400p-a-share, a price that is constantly watched inside and outside the company. When Swannell became chairman of M&amp;S in January 2011, the shares stood at 370p. On Tuesday, as he announced his departure next year, the price closed at 349p. Shareholders have had decent dividends on the way, of course, but in share price terms, M&amp;S is roughly where it started. The buzz of excitement from the food side has been drowned out by the disappointments in clothing. A chairman runs the board and not the company, so let\u2019s not overstate Swannell\u2019s role. But there is an unresolved mystery from his years. Under Marc Bolland, chief executive for most of Swannell\u2019s time, M&amp;S talked up its international prospects. Then Steve Rowe, who took over in April, said he would close 53 loss-making overseas stores in 10 countries, presenting the decision as an act of financial sanity given the size of the losses overseas. Rowe\u2019s logic seemed impeccable, so why didn\u2019t the board curb Bolland\u2019s enthusiasm? Swannell is staying until his successor is appointed, so there is still time for him to explain. Why keep the Nissan deal hush-hush? Encouraging news: the UK did not incur an \u201cidentifiable contingent liability\u201d when the government gave assurances to Nissan that the carmaker\u2019s new investments in this country would not suffer after Brexit. So says Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the National Audit Office, in a letter to Andrew Tyrie, head of the Treasury select committee. So why can\u2019t we all see what Nissan was told in writing by Greg Clark, the business secretary, in October? Tyrie is right to keep pressing for publication. The government\u2019s desire for secrecy looks increasingly ridiculous \u2013 and impossible to sustain.",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox is not expected to offer Sky News as a regulatory pawn to secure an \u00a311.2bn takeover of Britain\u2019s largest pay-TV broadcaster. Under a previous acquisition attempt in 2011, Murdoch struck a deal to spin off the loss-making Sky News in a bid to appease concerns raised by Ofcom, the media industry watchdog. However, it is understood that Fox believes that the industry landscape has changed significantly since then and that there should be less concern over the impact of a deal on the diversity of viewpoints across the media. Murdoch\u2019s stance emerged as a group of Sky shareholders called for \u201crobust\u201d safeguards to protect the broadcaster\u2019s \u201cfuture probity\u201d if Fox takes full control of the business. Alongside its call for safeguards, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, an association of 71 funds that control about 0.7% of Sky, also called for Ofcom to scrutinise the deal. Fox, which already owns 39% of Sky, is seeking to buy the remaining 61%. Referring to the phone-hacking scandal that derailed the previous Murdoch bid for Sky, the LAPFF said: \u201cAny recommendation by the board in favour would have to be based on an appropriate premium as well as safeguards for future probity given the past track records of the businesses controlled by the Murdochs. \u201cFurther clarity may also be needed so that public shareholders have full confidence that proposals are not being unduly influenced by the well-known relationships between Sky and 21st Century Fox.\u201d If Fox tables a formal bid for Sky, the culture secretary, Karen Bradley, has 10 working days to decide whether to ask Ofcom to investigate the deal. \u201cThe role of Ofcom would be helpful in bringing its expert scrutiny on a deal that will have a broader impact on the future of the broadcasting and print media marketplace in the UK,\u201d said Kieran Quinn, chairman of LAPFF. Five years ago, the Murdoch vehicle bidding for Sky was the now defunct News Corporation, then the parent of Fox. Ofcom determined that News Corporation\u2019s control of media \u2013 which at the time included the Times, Sunday Times, Sun and now-closed News of the World \u2013 would give Murdoch too much influence over news in the UK combined with full ownership of Sky. Fox also believes that structural changes within the Murdoch empire since 2011 will benefit its bid. Following the phone-hacking scandal and the abandonment of the News Corporation bid, Murdoch split his media group in two by putting his publishing assets into a new company, News Corp, and putting the TV and Hollywood studio assets into Fox. Fox believes this move to create two separate companies means there is not the same issue of media concentration as six years ago. In addition, the digital revolution has seen huge growth from Murdoch\u2019s traditional publishing rivals, coupled with the rise of newer players such as Google and Facebook as distributors of news and new arrivals such as Huffington Post, BuzzFeed, Mashable and Vice Media. However, given that the Murdoch family will be the ultimate owner of both newspaper and TV assets in the UK, Ofcom could still raise concerns if it is asked to investigate. Ofcom\u2019s public-interest test report into the 2011 bid states that the regulator has \u201cwide discretion\u201d in assessing the issue of media plurality. Sky and Fox declined to comment.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "With the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovering around 19,900 for the first time and Unicredit\u2019s move to shore up its balance sheet supporting banking shares, European markets are on the rise again. Investors have turned positive ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s expected interest rate increase on Wednesday, as the Santa rally continues. the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished 78.15 points or 1.13% higher at 6968.57, its highest close since the end of October Germany\u2019s Dax added 0.84% to 11,284.65 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.91% to 4803.87 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB finished 2.49% higher at 18,827.61, with Unicredit up nearly 16% Spain\u2019s Ibex ended 1.58% better at 9331.3 But in Greece, as a row about its bailout continued, the Athens market dipped 0.1% to 639.71 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 105 points or 0.5% at 19.901. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Back with Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and his visit to the island of Nisyros: The continuing rise in the US stock market ahead of Wednesday\u2019s Federal Reserve interest rate decision continues to drag Europe higher. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: There seems no stopping the Dow, as the headline index of US stocks lurches towards the 20,000 mark. The rally was supposed to start from the middle of the month, but with the Fed looming tomorrow, everyone seems keen to jam the index higher now, regardless of the consequences. In reality, we\u2019ll probably look back on 2016 as the year when the Santa rally began in November; no one really thought Santa would be a US businessman and TV personality with a penchant for outrageous statements, but in this seventh year of the post-financial crisis rally, we really should be prepared for anything. Perhaps the post-Fed environment will be different, but those expecting a big slump before the end of the year should be prepared for disappointment (and frankly, they\u2019d spoil the festive mood anyway). Instead, the next two weeks will most likely see the market drift, before the real work begins anew in January. Meanwhile Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras has further racheted up the pressure by announcing economic relief measures for Greeks living on far flung Aegean isles. Helena Smith reports: Islands which have borne the brunt of Greece\u2019s refugee crisis will henceforth be exempt from a special VAT tax demanded by creditors keeping the country afloat, said Tsipras making the announcement during a flying visit to one of the isles. \u201cCitizens on these islands must feel sure that the state is looking after them,\u201d the leader said speaking from the tiny island of Nisyros this afternoon. \u201cThey are shouldering the burden of reception and hospitality and, ultimately, the entire burden of Europe.\u201d The prime minister, who has already raised hackles announcing a one-off Christmas bonus for pensioners surviving on \u20ac800 or less, said his leftist-led government would not buckle under pressure to rescind the measure. The supplement, he insisted, came from money saved. \u201cWe will keep to the programme completely but we are not going to ask anyone about giving surplus money to those most in need.\u201d Senior government sources said the IMF had repeatedly got it wrong when it came to Greece. \u201cIt has gone from being excessively optimistic when it participated [in the last rescue programme] precisely because it wanted to stress its viability to overly pessimistic precisely because it is not participating in it,\u201d said one. Emergency funding to Greek financial institutions from the central bank continues to fall, according to new figures. Assistance from the Bank of Greece fell by 2.8% or \u20ac1.3bn in November to \u20ac45bn compared to the previous month. Ahead of the US rate decision on Wednesday - with the first hike in a year widely expected - Wall Street is on the front foot again. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has hit a new intra-day high of 19,915, although it has come off its best level to sit at 19901, up 105 points. The S&amp;P 500 has added 0.34% to a new high, while the Nasdaq Composite is up 0.37%. Back with Greece and the IMF\u2019s insistence it was not demanding more austerity. The eurozone appears very unhappy at the fund\u2019s comments, and called for the discussions over Greece not to be aired in public. Reuters reports: Euro zone officials hit back at the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday for publishing an article on the way forward for Greece\u2019s fiscal and economic policy that thrust into the open a row between the lenders over Athens\u2019 bailout. \u201cThe European institutions were surprised that the IMF staff published a blog post on the ongoing negotiations with the Greek government as new talks in Athens are starting with the aim of concluding the second review,\u201d said a spokesman for the euro zone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. \u201cWe hope that we can return to the practice of conducting program negotiations with the Greek government in private.\u201d The IMF article appeared as the Fund and the euro zone struggle to find common ground on Greek policies that would allow the IMF to take part in the latest bailout, the third one since 2010 and now fully financed by the euro zone. The IMF, which a group of countries led by Germany very much want to join the latest program for credibility reasons, says euro zone targets set for Greece are too ambitious and assumptions on reform implementation too optimistic. It said it was against further austerity in Greece and that a primary surplus target of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2018, on which the euro zone insists, risks damaging the nascent recovery. The head of the European Department Poul Thomsen and chief economist Maury Obstfeld said a Greek primary surplus of 1.5 percent in 2018 would be enough and stood a better chance of being sustained for several years. After its latest contribution to the Greek debt crisis, the IMF has also issued its latest thoughts on Austria. In its latest assessment of the country\u2019s situation it said: Austria is stable and prosperous. Nevertheless, it can still improve its economic performance to ensure a continuing rise in incomes and employment within a stable macroeconomic environment. To this end, a comprehensive package of structural and fiscal reforms can raise low GDP growth and ensure the steady decline of public debt in the long term. Financial system stability needs to be maintained in a challenging environment. Austria\u2019s recovery has strengthened. In 2016, we project growth at 1.4 percent, an improvement over the average growth of 0.6 percent in 2012-15. Growth has been broad based, driven by private consumption supported by income tax reductions, a recovery in investment, and higher public consumption due to spending on refugees. At 1.4 percent y/y in October, inflation remains low, but is above the Euro Area average (0.5 percent). Employment growth has picked up in 2016, catching up with the rising labor supply driven by migration and higher labor force participation. As a result, unemployment has stabilized recently, although it remains elevated relative to historical levels... A reform package combining structural reforms with deficit-neutral fiscal measures could permanently boost potential GDP by some 3 percent over the medium term. Efficiency gains in public spending would create fiscal space for further growth-supporting policies and ensure the continued decline of public debt. Maintaining financial stability is a key component of a stable overall macroeconomic environment. Time for a quick look at the European markets. The moves by Italian bank Unicredit to bolster its balance sheet have lifted the banking sector, while after the excitement of the Murdoch bid for Sky, Italian broadcaster Mediaset is also in demand after France\u2019s Vivendi said it planned to raise its 3% stake to as much as 20%. So the pan-European Stoxx 600 index is up 0.74% to an 11 month high. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 1.4%, while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac have both climbed 0.51%. In the UK, the FTSE 100 is 0.6% better after stronger than expected UK inflation figures. Ahead of the expected US rate rise on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is expected to open around 66 points higher. Shareholders in the Bank of Cyprus have overwhelmingly backed plans for a London listing. Some 99.74% have approved the move, which will see the bank keep its listing in Cyprus but abandon its quote on the Athens stock exchange. The bank said the standard listing in London was \u201ca key milestone\u201d in its recovery since 2013. It added: \u201cA holding company has been established in Ireland in order for the Group to be considered eligible for inclusion in the FTSE UK Index Series following a step up to a premium listing at a future date.\u201d It said the London listing would improve the liquidity of its stock and give it access to a wider range of investors capable of \u201csupporting the Bank in the long-term.\u201d Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit, and Manos Giakoumis of analyst service Macropolis both sound pessimistic about the Greek bailout: Back in the UK, drivers for the Argos retail chain have called a 72-hour strike in a row over holiday pay. The industrial action could make it harder to get presents from Argos in time for Christmas: Our friends at The Telegraph have published a handy Q&amp;A on the Greek bailout saga, as relations between the various parties appear to deteriorate. Here\u2019s a flavour: Right now Greece and the EU have lined up an $86bn bailout, hoping that the IMF will join in. Germany in particular is keen to have the IMF\u2019s seal of approval, as it is seen as a sign that the deal is rigorous. Much of the discussion currently focuses on the degree of fiscal tightening that can take place, as the IMF fears the EU is being too tough, while the EU thinks the IMF is too pessimistic over what can be achieved. Those talks will continue into the new year, rather than the IMF joining in 2016 as had been hoped in Brussels and Athens. A short-term deal has been agreed that cancels a planned rise in interest rates on Greece\u2019s debts, and aims to guarantee the current low cost of funds for years to come. But the underlying economy is still in a dire shape - unemployment is above 23pc, and sustained GDP growth remains elusive. In the longer term, the IMF wants major reforms to the Greek economy. This new war of words between Greece and the IMF suggests that the Greek debt crisis, rarely dormant for long, is flaring back into life again. The Wall Street Journal suggests today that early elections are a possibility, if Athens and its creditors cannot agree on what measure to take to ensure Greece is complying with its bailout. The WSJ says: The embattled prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who is due to hold talks with the leaders of Germany and France in the coming days, surprised Greeks and creditors last week with fiscal gifts that were widely seen as preparing the option of elections. He promised 1.6 million pensioners a Christmas bonus of between \u20ac300 ($319) and \u20ac800. He also suspended a planned increase in sales tax for Aegean islands that have received large numbers of Middle-East refugees. EU officials said they would study whether Mr. Tsipras\u2019s promises are compatible with Greece\u2019s bailout commitments. Snap elections next year would lead to Syriza\u2019s defeat, party officials expect, and a new government led by the conservative New Democracy party. Syriza officials say their goal in possible elections would be to avoid being crushed\u2014which they view as a danger if they hold on too long without concessions from creditors. Gabriel Sterne of Oxford Economics flags up how Greece\u2019s efforts to boost tax receipts have backfired spectacularly since its first bailout: The European Commission has also been defending itself from the IMF\u2019s criticism of the Greek bailout: Breaking away from UK inflation, because Greece\u2019s finance minister has got in touch with us. Euclid Tsakalotos isn\u2019t happy with the IMF\u2019s claim last night that it hasn\u2019t been forcing more austerity on Greece. [As explained earlier, the Fund says it shouldn\u2019t be blamed for asking if the targets agreed between Greece and the rest of Europe are credible] Tsakalotos\u2019s comments come as monitors arrive in Athens for fresh talks about the country\u2019s bailout programme. From Athens, Helena Smith reports: Greece is being boxed into a corner and the International Monetary Fund is economizing with the truth when it says it is not asking for more austerity but rather is the victim of Greece\u2019s bizarre predilection to \u201cagree\u201d to higher primary fiscal targets of 3.5% of GDP. That is the verdict of Euclid Tsakalotos, the Greek finance minister who in exclusive comments to the Guardian this morning responded witheringly to the Washington-based body\u2019s assertion that Athens will need to make yet more pension and tax cuts after its bailout programme expires in mid-2018 \u2013 a demand that no government, after seven years of relentless recession, could accept or survive. \u201cThe Oxford philosopher J L Austen was particularly critical of forms of argument that relied on the following technique: there\u2019s the bit where you say it, and then there\u2019s the bit where you take it back. The IMF is particularly open to this criticism,\u201d Tsakalotos told me. \u201cIn effect it is arguing for Greek pensioners and poorer wage earners to make further economies, while it economizes on the truth.\u201d The Oxford-educated economist, who was raised in Britain, said in its obsession to make the numbers add up the IMF was now advocating policies that would increase inequality and social exclusion \u2013 contradicting its own self-avowed goal of emphasising the importance of inclusive growth. In their blog overnight, the Fund\u2019s Europe director Poul Thomsen and chief economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld argued that: \u201cGreece cannot modernize its economy by boosting funding for infrastructure and well-targeted social programs while exempting more than half of households from income taxes and paying public pensions at the level of the richest European countries.\u201d Tsakalotos disputes this claim, arguing that: \u201cGreek expenditure on both pensions and other subsidies is about 70% of the EU average and 52% of that of Germany. Is it likely when around 45% of pensioners receive monthly payments below the poverty line of \u20ac665, and almost four million people, that is more than a third of the population, have been classed as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion, that Greece\u2019s main problem is that pensions and tax credit allowances are too generous? At the same time, the only reason why more people are exempt from paying income tax is that fewer people have decent incomes. So the IMF that is supposedly rethinking the relationship between development and inequality, and is rightly emphasizing the importance of inclusive growth, seems to be unaware that further reducing pensions and the tax credit allowance cannot but fail to increase both inequality and social exclusion. But at least then the numbers will add up.\u201d The Greek finance minister emphatically denied that Athens had agreed with the demand of its euro zone partners to pursue a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP in the post-programme period. Instead, he said the Greek government had offered a compromise solution when euro zone finance ministers held their last meeting on December 5th. \u201cI laid out the position of the Greek government that high primary surpluses for an economy like Greece and what it has gone through during the crisis make no economic or political sense,\u201d he insisted. \u201cSome member states were supporting the position that the 3.5% figure should be preserved for ten years; others were working towards a compromise of five years. The Greek position was that neither would work for Greece and we suggested the compromise of going down immediately to 2.5%, but agreeing with the institutions that the one percentage point reduction from 3.5% should be spent entirely on reducing taxes on small and medium sized enterprises, thus enhancing competitiveness and growth. What was the IMF response? The IMF argued within the Eurogroup that: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to us whether it is three, five or ten years of high surpluses, we will still need to see more measures to make the numbers add up since we don\u2019t think that 3.5% is achievable without such measures\u201d. It did not bother to address our compromise suggestion. So Greece has not \u201cagreed\u201d to anything yet. However, it is under intense pressure from its creditors to do so. The IMF has done little to alleviate that pressure. Instead of having the courage of its convictions and helping us reduce the size and/or the timespan of the surpluses, it is putting all the pressure on us to specify new austerity measures for 2019 and beyond.\u201d Phew! And separately, the Athens government has just suggested that talks with its lenders over its bailout programme could be completed early next month. Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is concerned that the cost of living in Britain jumped in November \u201cThis rise in inflation, following many independent forecasts expecting it to go up further while earnings are set to fall back in coming years, only continues to underline why Labour have been calling on the government to change direction and reverse their cuts to in-work benefits such as Universal Credit, and disabled people on ESA. Nick Dixon, Investment Director at investment group Aegon, believes rising inflation will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates in 2017: \u201cLow interest rates are reaching the end of the road. Inflation is now on the rise and sentiment amongst monetary policy makers is hardening in the UK and US. With expectations that UK inflation will exceed its 2% target in early 2017, we can expect monetary belt tightening during the next 6-9 months. Whilst savers will cheer signals that interest rates will follow suit, mortgage holders are already starting to see the best rates disappear and may want to speak to their adviser about fixing rates quicker than the Bank can make its move.\u201d You can see the full inflation report here. Andrew Sentance, PwC\u2019s chief economist, says Britain is now feeling the effect of the plunge in the pound since the Brexit vote. And further price rises are on the horizon, he warns: \u201cInflation is picking up as expected - to its highest level for over two years. Prices in the shops and on the garage forecourt are starting to reflect the big drop in sterling since the EU referendum result. Clothing prices have risen by over 4% since June and motor fuel prices are 7.4% up on a year ago. \u201cThere is more inflation coming through the pipeline. The prices of UK manufactures are already 2.3% up on a year ago and the cost of raw materials, energy and other inputs into the manufacturing process are nearly 13% higher than a year ago. We should therefore expect inflation to rise to close to 3% by the end of next year, which will squeeze consumer spending and slow economic growth. We are leaving behind the very favourable world of near-zero inflation which has benefited consumers over the past couple of years. Digging into the inflation report, the ONS points out that some tech firms have been hiking their price because of the weak pound. Here\u2019s the key section: Recreation and culture: Prices, overall, increased by 0.5% between October and November 2016, compared with a negligible change a year ago. The upward effect came principally from data processing equipment where prices rose this year but fell a year ago, particularly for peripherals. There have been reports from some IT equipment manufacturers over the last few months of prices being affected by changes in the exchange rate with products generally being priced in US dollars. The ONS is is absolutely right - Apple raised the prices of several MacBook pros by hundreds of pounds in October, for example. The report also contains the surprising news that leather sofas have got pricier: Clothing and footwear: the upward effect came mainly from clothing (in particular women\u2019s and men\u2019s outerwear) for which prices, overall, increased by 1.6% between October and November this year, compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: Prices, overall, increased by 0.5% between October and November 2016, compared with a fall of 0.2% a year ago. Within this group, the largest contribution to the change in the rate came from prices for furniture and furnishings, particularly leather settees. There was also an upward contribution from non-durable household goods such as household cleaner cream and bleach. Transport: The upward contribution to the change in the rate came from motor fuels, with petrol prices rising by 1.6 pence per litre between October and November this year but falling by 1.5 pence per litre a year ago. Similarly diesel prices rose by 2.0 pence this year but fell by 0.6 pence a year ago. Fuel prices tend to reflect movements in oil prices and part of the increase in oil prices during 2016 to date can be explained by depreciation of sterling against the US dollar. Food and non-alcoholic beverages: Prices, overall, increased by 0.4% this year compared with 0.1% a year ago leading to a small upward contribution to the change in the rate. The main upward effects came from: bread and cereal products such as garlic bread and pizza; and milk, cheese and eggs, particularly milk and yoghurt/fromage frais. These were partly offset by a small downward effect from confectionery. The ONS\u2019s head of inflation Mike Prestwood, says: \u201cNovember\u2019s slight rally in the value of sterling eased the inflationary pressure on businesses importing raw materials but consumer prices continued to edge upwards, due mainly to the rising cost of clothing and fuel.\u201d Paul Sirani, chief market analyst at city firmi Xtrade, also fears that British households face difficult times: \u201cInflation has soared to a 25-month high as Brexit uncertainties and sterling\u2019s devaluation continue to filter through the UK economy. \u201cThese latest figures are expected to limit the buoyant consumer spending which has accounted for the resilience in growth since June\u2019s referendum. Meanwhile, the increasing weakness of the Brexit-hit pound is likely to provide households with a painful few months as rising prices take their toll. The pound has risen almost half a cent since the inflation data was released, to $1.2718. Tom Stevenson, investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International, warns that inflation appears to be heading over the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target: Higher inflation means the pound in your pocket won\u2019t stretch as far and many will be thinking how they can make their money work harder. There is little evidence so far that rising inflation will translate into much higher interest rates, so anyone with savings still sitting in cash will struggle to generate real returns. To stand any chance of achieving an inflation-adjusted real return they\u2019ll need to look further up the risk spectrum, investing in bonds issued by companies rather than the Government or moving into stocks and shares. The jump in inflation last month may show that the slump in the pound since the EU referendum is now hitting families. Hannah Maundrell of money.co.uk says it\u2019s a \u2018wake-up call\u2019: \u201cHousehold finances have been protected against the backlash of Brexit so far but today\u2019s higher than expected figures show it\u2019s finally starting to bite. This is the start of things to come and next year we\u2019ll be battling rising prices head on. This will get worse mid-way through the year as retailer\u2019s forward pricing starts to run out and we have to foot the bill for the real cost of purchases. \u201cThis is an important wake up call and one we should all bear in mind as we head towards the most expensive time of the year. Blow your budget on Christmas now and you could be setting yourself up for a very difficult year ahead. There\u2019s no better argument for keeping tabs on your festive spending and only celebrating with cash you can afford to part with.\u201d Duncan Weldon of the Resolution Group shows how the cost of consumer goods is now rising, for the first time in two years: Separate data from Britain\u2019s factories shows that their output costs (what they charge for their wares) jumped by 2.2% in November. That may drive inflation higher, once those goods hit the shops. Reuters\u2019 Jamie McGeever says it will erode real earnings: Britain\u2019s \u2018core consumer prices index\u2019 rate, which strips out volatile items like energy and food, has risen to 1.4%. That suggests that underlying price pressures are building. At 1.2%, Britain\u2019s inflation rate is heading back towards the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target: Almost every category of goods and services pushed the inflation rate up: On a monthly basis, the consumer prices index rose by 0.2% between October and November - with clothing and food prices up during the month. Higher petrol and diesel costs, and a fall in food price deflation, drove UK inflation up last month. The Office for National Statistics says: Rises in the prices of clothing, motor fuels and a variety of recreational and cultural goods and services, most notably data processing equipment, were the main contributors to the increase in the rate. These upward pressures were partially offset by falls in air and sea fares. Breaking! Britain\u2019s inflation rate has jumped to 1.2% in November, up from 0.9% in October. That\u2019s the highest level since October 2014, and more than economists had expected. More to follow... Milan\u2019s stock market is giving Unicredit\u2019s plan a thumbs-up - shares in the bank are now up 7%. The pound is flat this morning, at $1.2685 against the US dollar, but that could change once November\u2019s inflation figures hit the wires at 9.30am. Kathleen Brooks of City Index explains what traders will be looking for: CPI data out later this morning is worth watching for a couple of reasons, it is expected to rise to 1.1%, which would be the fastest pace of price growth for 2 years, this comes at an interesting time for sterling as the market ponders another leg higher in its recovery. Prices are expected to resume their upward trend after a 0.1% decline in October. Fuel price increases and a reduction in food price deflation is likely to drive CPI higher in November. The one-off factors that weighed on October prices, such as the large drop in clothing sales, are unlikely to be repeated in November. A jump in inflation could trigger concerns that consumers will rein in their spending, she adds. Rising prices could also raise questions about the future for UK consumption, a key pillar of GDP growth. Retail sales have held up well in the last few months as consumers brush off Brexit-uncertainty. London\u2019s financial markets are rather subdued ahead of November\u2019s inflation data, in just under 30 minutes. Defensive stocks, such as consumer good firms, are in favour. The FTSE 100 has risen by 14 points, led by fashion chain Burberry (up 2.7%), with Unilever (+1.6%) also making ground. Italian bank shares are rising, as Unicredit\u2019s turnaround plan creates a little more confidence that the sector can get over its problems. Shares in Monte dei Paschi have gained 1.4%, as traders watch to see if it can get its own cash call, of \u20ac5bn, out of the door soon. UniCredit\u2019s revamp is a key moment in Italy\u2019s bank crisis, says Reuters columnist Neil Unmack: A cost cull, bad debt purge and mega-cash call mean the country\u2019s biggest bank should soon be less of a worry. With Rome facing a volatile 2017, it\u2019s just as well. Investors may need persuading to back such a huge rights issue, at a time of political uncertainty, he adds. They may conclude that the growth forecasts underpinning the plan are too optimistic. But still: [CEO Jean-Pierre] Mustier\u2019s plan is robust enough, and healthier bigger lenders could mean more options for smaller ones. Assuming Europe can muddle through, UniCredit shouldn\u2019t have to. After falling 4% at the start of trading, Unicredit shares are now up almost 3% as investors digest its restructuring plan. Unicredit\u2019s rescue plan also involves purging itself of almost \u20ac18 of bad debt. It plans to bundle these non-performing loans into new securities that will be sold off to investors. And it is booking an \u20ac8.1bn provision against losses on bad loans, taking its total charge to \u20ac12.2bn (which is why it needs to hold a \u20ac13bn rights issue to raise new funds from shareholders) Banking analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford of Jefferies says Unicredit has \u201cgone aggressive\u201d, with the restructuring plan announced today. Creelan-Sandford explains: Unicredit has announced a a \u20ac13bn rights issue, much of which will be consumed by writedowns and restructuring charges. The upfront bill of a \u20ac13bn is clearly large but as we have highlighted previously we think an aggressive balance sheet clean-up paves the way for a more substantial re-rating. The aggressive cost reduction is to be supported by substantial IT investment while the bank envisages net headcount reduction of 14,000 people by 2019 (equivalent to over 11% Group headcount). Speaking of banks... Britain\u2019s government has just sold another tranche of Lloyds Banking Group shares. This takes its stake below 7% - eight years after Lloyds (and Royal Bank of Scotland) were bailed out. The race to fend off a crisis in Italy\u2019s banking sector has taken a decisive shift this morning, as the country\u2019s biggest lender unveiled a wide-ranging restructuring plan. Unicredit will raise \u20ac13bn by issuing new shares to investors, clean up the bad debts on its balance sheet and attempt to boost long-term productivity. It is also planning to \u201ctransform\u201d its operating model and \u201cstreamline\u201d its products and services, to cut costs. And that means cutting jobs too -- Unicredit is announcing another 6,500 job cuts today, which means 14,000 staff will have been culled by 2019. CEO Jean Pierre Mustier, calls it a \u201cpragmatic\u201d plan, that will tackle its exposure to non-performing loans - the bad debts that have build up over many years and never been tackled. \u201cWe are taking decisive actions to deal with our NPE legacy issues to improve and support recurring future profitability to become one of Europe\u2019s most attractive banks.\u201d Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Is inflation back? We\u2019ll find out at 9.30am GMT when new cost of living data is released. Economists predict that the consumer prices index (CPI) rose to 1.1% in November, up from October, partly due to rising petrol and food prices. If so, that would suggest that the weak pound is now feeding through to consumers, by pushing up import costs. A month ago, UK inflation surprisingly dipped, but analysts at RBC Capital Markets believe CPI will bounce back today: Last month\u2019s unexpected dip back below 1% y/y on the headline CPI measure had a lot to do with the negative contribution from the clothing and footwear sector. The arithmetic suggests the hurdle is low for somewhat of a reversal this month. Furthermore, it looks likely that petrol prices will also add to the headline annual inflation rate. With oil producers now working together to stem supply, petrol prices are probably heading higher too..... Also coming up today Unicredit, Italy\u2019s largest bank, is announcing plans to restructure itself and raise billions in new capital. The plan is being unveiled as Rome continues pushing for private investors to rescue Monte dei Paschi, its oldest bank. more on that shortly. Things are hotting up in Greece too, after the International Monetary Fund denied it was forcing more austerity on Athens. In a new blogpost last night,top officials warned that the Greece was not implementing the right sort of policies that would actually lead to growth. In a \u201cDon\u2019t blame us!\u201d moment, Poul Thomsen, director of the IMF\u2019s European department, and Maurice Obstfeld, the fund\u2019s chief economist, wrote: It is not the IMF that is demanding more austerity, either now or as a means to lower the need for debt relief over the medium-term. Or to be more direct, if Greece agrees with its European partners on ambitious fiscal targets, don\u2019t criticize the IMF for being the ones insisting on austerity when we ask to see the measures required to make such targets credible. We\u2019ll watch out for reaction to that, plus all the other key events through the day...",

Nevertheless, it can still improve its economic performance to ensure a continuing rise in incomes and employment within a stable macroeconomic environment. To this end, a comprehensive package of structural and fiscal reforms can raise low GDP growth and ensure the steady decline of public debt in the long term. Financial system stability needs to be maintained in a challenging environment. </p> <p> Austria\u2019s recovery has strengthened. In 2016, we project growth at 1.4 percent, an improvement over the average growth of 0.6 percent in 2012-15. Growth has been broad based, driven by private consumption supported by income tax reductions, a recovery in investment, and higher public consumption due to spending on refugees. At 1.4 percent y/y in October, inflation remains low, but is above the Euro Area average (0.5 percent). Employment growth has picked up in 2016, catching up with the rising labor supply driven by migration and higher labor force participation. As a result, unemployment has stabilized recently, although it remains elevated relative to historical levels...</p> <p>A reform package combining structural reforms with deficit-neutral fiscal measures could permanently boost potential GDP by some 3 percent over the medium term. Efficiency gains in public spending would create fiscal space for further growth-supporting policies and ensure the continued decline of public debt. Maintaining financial stability is a key component of a stable overall macroeconomic environment.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a6741389514cacfc0ca0c5af43f98e6073ab373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a6741389514cacfc0ca0c5af43f98e6073ab373/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vienna.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vienna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heinz-Peter Bader/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584ffca7e4b025760cee4680\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T13:56:25.185Z\">1.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">European shares move higher</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Time for a quick look at the European markets.</p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/13/italian-banking-crisis-unicredit-to-raise-13bn-euros\">moves by Italian bank Unicredit to bolster its balance sheet </a> </strong>have lifted the banking sector, while after the excitement of the Murdoch bid for Sky, Italian broadcaster Mediaset is also in demand after France\u2019s Vivendi said it planned to raise its 3% stake to as much as 20%.</p> <p>So the pan-European Stoxx 600 index is up 0.74% to an 11 month high.

The IMF is particularly open to this criticism,\u201d Tsakalotos told me.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cIn effect it is arguing for Greek pensioners and poorer wage earners to make further economies, while it economizes on the truth.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>The Oxford-educated economist, who was raised in Britain, said in its obsession to make the numbers add up the IMF was now advocating policies that would increase inequality and social exclusion \u2013 contradicting its own self-avowed goal of emphasising the importance of inclusive growth. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2016/12/12/the-imf-is-not-asking-greece-for-more-austerity/?hootPostID=c398a13236d77bf205a31b81664622e6\">In their blog overnight</a>, the Fund\u2019s Europe director Poul Thomsen and chief economic counsellor Maurice Obstfeld argued that: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGreece cannot modernize its economy by boosting funding for infrastructure and well-targeted social programs while exempting more than half of households from income taxes and paying public pensions at the level of the richest European countries.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tsakalotos </strong>disputes this claim, arguing that: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cGreek expenditure on both pensions and other subsidies is about 70% of the EU average and 52% of that of Germany. Is it likely when around 45% of pensioners receive monthly payments below the poverty line of \u20ac665, and almost four million people, that is more than a third of the population, have been classed as being at risk of poverty or social exclusion, that Greece\u2019s main problem is that pensions and tax credit allowances are too generous?</p> <p>At the same time, the only reason why more people are exempt from paying income tax is that fewer people have decent incomes. So the IMF that is supposedly rethinking the relationship between development and inequality, and is rightly emphasizing the importance of inclusive growth, seems to be unaware that further reducing pensions and the tax credit allowance cannot but fail to increase both inequality and social exclusion. But at least then the numbers will add up.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>The Greek finance minister emphatically denied that Athens had agreed with the demand of its euro zone partners to pursue a primary surplus of 3.5% of GDP in the post-programme period.</strong></p> <p>Instead, he said the Greek government had offered a compromise solution when euro zone finance ministers held their last meeting on December 5th. <br> \u201cI laid out the position of the Greek government that high primary surpluses for an economy like Greece and what it has gone through during the crisis make no economic or political sense,\u201d he insisted. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cSome member states were supporting the position that the 3.5% figure should be preserved for ten years; others were working towards a compromise of five years. The Greek position was that neither would work for Greece and we suggested the compromise of going down immediately to 2.5%, but agreeing with the institutions that the one percentage point reduction from 3.5% should be spent entirely on reducing taxes on small and medium sized enterprises, thus enhancing competitiveness and growth. What was the IMF response? The IMF argued within the Eurogroup that: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to us whether it is three, five or ten years of high surpluses, we will still need to see more measures to make the numbers add up since we don\u2019t think that 3.5% is achievable without such measures\u201d. It did not bother to address our compromise suggestion.</p> <p>So Greece has not \u201cagreed\u201d to anything yet. However, it is under intense pressure from its creditors to do so. The IMF has done little to alleviate that pressure. Instead of having the courage of its convictions and helping us reduce the size and/or the timespan of the surpluses, it is putting all the pressure on us to specify new austerity measures for 2019 and beyond.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Phew!</strong> And separately, the Athens government has just suggested that talks with its lenders over its bailout programme could be completed early next month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos/status/808626581669347332\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Govt Spokesman: Deal with bailout lenders could be in &#39;first few days of January&#39; - Athens still wants IMF in Program<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bailout?src=hash\">#Bailout</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/C3yWKcHcD9\">pic.twitter.com/C3yWKcHcD9</a></p>&mdash; Derek Gatopoulos (@dgatopoulos) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dgatopoulos/status/808626581669347332\">December 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T11:52:06.150Z\">at 11.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-584fd7a6e4b077e9848506b6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T11:13:20.754Z\">11.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey MP</strong>, Labour\u2019s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is concerned that the cost of living in Britain jumped in November</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cThis rise in inflation, following many independent forecasts expecting it to go up further while earnings are set to fall back in coming years, only continues to underline why Labour have been calling on the government to change direction and reverse their cuts to in-work benefits such as Universal Credit, and disabled people on ESA.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-584fd2dae4b0e02f2b16b9b1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T11:02:31.447Z\">11.02am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nick Dixon, Investment Director at investment group Aegon, believes rising inflation will prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates in 2017:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cLow interest rates are reaching the end of the road.

      "bodyText": "Argos shoppers could face delays to deliveries of their Christmas presents after drivers at its main distribution centre in Staffordshire voted to strike for three days from 20 December. It comes after Post Office workers voted to stage five days of strikes in the run-up to Christmas in a long-running dispute over jobs and pensions. The 35 Argos drivers, who all work on big lorries taking goods from the catalogue shop\u2019s central warehouse run by logistics firm Wincanton to regional centres from where they are sent out to stores, are protesting over holiday pay. Unite, the union acting for the workers based at the depot near Burton upon Trent, said each driver was owed about \u00a3700 in holiday pay dating back at least two years. The dispute comes after it was ruled that overtime and additional shift payments should be taken into account when assessing holiday pay.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far: Tens of thousands of commuters have faced travel chaos on the Southern rail network in an escalating dispute over who closes train doors. A strike by train drivers has brought Southern rail services to a complete halt after the court of appeal rejected a second attempt by the rail company to block the action. Transport secretary Chris Grayling dismissed the strike as \u201cfutile\u201d and threatened to introduce measures to restrict strikes on the rail network. He said: \u201cWe are thinking very carefully about how we take things forward. I\u2019m not going to rule anything in or anything out today.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, urged Grayling to return to talks with the unions. \u201cRather than threaten strike bans, he should do his job and get on with negotiations,\u201d he said. All of Southern\u2019s 2,242 weekday services were cancelled, causing the worst disruption on the network for more than 20 years. Commuters were urged not to travel. Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said the union was prepared to negotiate to end the dispute and accused Grayling of \u201cplaying games\u201d behind the scenes. \u201cI would hope that we were getting round a table very very soon,\u201d he said. Judges upheld last week\u2019s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), that industrial action called by the train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, infringed rights under European law. GTR had already urged passengers not to travel on Tuesday, irrespective of the court\u2019s decision, warning that it would not be able to run a service. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said passengers had been abandoned by the government and called on ministers to allow Transport for London to take control of Souther Rail. Grayling dismissed the suggestion as \u201cnonsense\u201d. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, rejected government claims that the strike is political. He said: \u201cThis morning Chris Grayling claimed again that the action on Southern is political \u2013 it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s about safe train operation for both passengers and staff alike.\u201d Commuters are planning a demonstration outside the Department for Transport on Thursday. They are demanding that Grayling resign if he can\u2019t end the strike. We\u2019re going to pause the blog for now but we\u2019ll return to it if there are major developments. And there\u2019ll be more soon on Southern section. Southern is topping one performance table, writes Gwyn Topham. The website Sorry for the Inconvenience, tracks the number of apologies issued by train companies on social media to passengers. Southern has apologised over 38,000 times this year, well ahead of nearest rival Great Western Railway. Industrial action could threaten that though: with no services to apologise for during the strike, it has said sorry only 36 times by 2pm \u2013 a third of the usual daily total. A cartoon in the Times portrays the dispute as trench warfare between commuters and the rail unions. When, where and why is the Southern rail strike taking place? Our transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham, has all the answers. Aslef accuses Grayling of \u2018playing games\u2019 Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef, said the union was prepared to negotiate to end the dispute and accused Chris Grayling of \u201cplaying games\u201d behind the scenes. \u201cWe offered to go to talks,\u201d he told Sky News. Whelan added: \u201cI would hope that we were getting round a table very very soon. We hope people listen to us, come talk to us and find a real way through this.\u201d Asked if he had confidence in the transport secretary, Whelan said: \u201cHe has quoted items today that I wasn\u2019t even aware he was involved in. I had no idea that he was the guiding hand behind the scenes over the offer on Sunday that came from the company, in a private and confidential conversation, which miraculously appeared on the DfT website yesterday. So I do wonder who in all of this is playing games.\u201d Asked about Grayling\u2019s claims that he had threatened the government with 10 years of industrial action, Whelan said: \u201cNormally meetings between ministers and ourselves are [subject to] Chatham House rules. But I\u2019m quite happy to give my version of events. I relayed our concerns over safety. He was quite intransigent about our concerns. I then quite openly said then we will have years of problems going ahead if that is going to be the case. I never threatened him. It was an open statement about the likelihood of where we would be industrially if that was the position that was maintained.\u201d Whelan added: \u201cThis isn\u2019t about a victory over the government. This is about a long-held policy for over 15 years, where our members have become increasingly concerned about the ability to safely operate these trains. We are not doing it for gain. We are doing it for safety reasons. We want a safer railway.\u201d The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, has rejected Chris Grayling\u2019s threat to restrict future strike action. He urged the transport secretary to find a negotiated solution. But Tory MP Paul Scully, who represents many Southern commuters in his Sutton, Cheam and Worcester Park constituency, blamed unions for refusing to negotiate without preconditions. In a statement on the strike he said: Southern and the unions need to remember the commuters they represent rather than point-scoring. I am deeply disappointed that the unions are refusing to come to talks even without any preconditions. This is all about who presses a button to close the doors. Driver-only operated trains operate on over a third of the rail network already, all trains that go through Sutton are driver-only operated and Thameslink drivers are at work today, represented by the same union, and they are driving driver-only operated trains. This makes this strike look vindictive rather than about a credible safety concern. I continue to call for these strikes to be called off. People are losing or quitting their jobs because of how appalling the train service is \u2013 this cannot be allowed to continue. The strike and wider industrial action needs to end now so we can go back to tackling the underlying issues that have dogged this network for years. Sadiq Khan has more on his call for responsibility for London rail services to be handed to Transport for London. Setting out a business case for the move the mayor\u2019s office said: TfL has a proven track record of making rail services better. Devolving this responsibility to TfL would allow us to work towards a fully integrated transport service, structured fares and transparent management. Londoners \u2013 regardless of age, income or background \u2013 rely on train services to be fast, frequent and affordable every day. Services on the rail network should meet the same high standards achieved by the rest of London\u2019s transport network. Currently this is not the case across the suburban rail network. By taking advantage of TfL\u2019s proven track record of making rail services better, there is an opportunity to provide a truly integrated, reliable and affordable rail network. Rail devolution would also lead to economic benefits within communities. The biggest impact would be in south London, where house building rates are less than half the rest of London, because of poorer transport connections. A single mother who faces travelling more than six hours to get to and from work each day during the strike has set out her plight in a letter to her MP. PA reports: Jenny Lehane was forced to get her six-year-old son Matthew out of bed at 5.30am on Tuesday - an hour and a half early - so she could drop him at a friend\u2019s house and travel from Coulsdon, Croydon, to Camden in north London. The 37-year-old catering manager\u2019s usual commute is 1hr 20min \u2013 taking a Southern service from Coulsdon South to London Bridge before catching the Jubilee line to West Hampstead. But on Tuesday she says it took 3hr 30min. She had to get a bus before squashing on to an \u201cabsolutely packed\u201d tram after not being able to squeeze on to two earlier ones, before taking the Jubilee line from Wimbledon to West Brompton. In an emotional email to Chris Philp, MP for Croydon South, Lehane wrote: \u201cI am writing this on a bus with tears streaming down my face at the utter failure of our MPs and government to do anything to stop this completely intolerable failure by Southern to run the service that my fares and taxes are paying for. \u201cIt depresses me that the government, voted for by us, the hardworking, tax-paying commuters, will do nothing to help us.\u201d Lehane told the Press Association: \u201cWhen I saw the sign advising people not to travel I got so cross. People have to work, businesses have to run. We can\u2019t all march to their tune. \u201cI have worked hard for the same company for 15 years. I should be able to get a train and live my life without this stress.\u201d People who gave up trying to get into the office have been telling us what it\u2019s like to work from home, writes Rachel Obordo. Rebecca, 24, from East Grinsted, normally commutes daily on Southern rail. She said: I\u2019ve had to stay at home today because I can\u2019t face the stress and hassle, not to mention the additional cost and time loss, of finding an alternative route to my office in London. Not that a non-strike day is much better \u2013 yesterday my journey home took over three hours, with the majority of delays and cancellations attributed to ongoing industrial action. Unfortunately my workload doesn\u2019t disappear just because I can\u2019t be in the office. This is far from ideal in the run-up to Christmas. The stress and anxiety this dispute is causing passengers is shameful. I feel for tourists visiting the UK who are met with this turmoil and are unprepared to make alternative arrangements, and for passengers with disabilities, or those more vulnerable, who have to put up with chaos and dangerous conditions on a daily basis. Luckily for Lee, an understanding employer means working from home is not really an issue. But, for Fiona and her partner, working from home has been tricky. Under Southern plans drivers will be solely responsible for the safety of up to 1,500 people, according to Aslef\u2019s Graham Morris. Speaking to Damien Gayle he said that level of responsibility as well as driving the train is \u201cunacceptable\u201d. He added: \u201cThis is about them saving money.\u201d Southern has confirmed that none of its trains are operating today because of the strike. Passengers are advised not to travel, it says. This map shows the lines hit: Google Trends has a list of the top five Southern rail related queries on its search engine. Mark Colombini, Aslef executive committee member for south London and the south-east, has been outlining the safety concerns behind the strike. Speaking to Damien Gayle he said: It\u2019s important to understand that it would be quite a crass oversimplification of the dispute to boil it down to one issue. It\u2019s multifaceted, but safety is certainly one of the key factors and that\u2019s in terms of operational safety of the railway. At the moment we have trains that are dispatched by the guard or conductor and the guard is responsible for monitoring the safe dispatch of those trains. The guard will ensure it is safe to dispatch those trains and will tell the driver it\u2019s safe to do so. What they are looking to do under driver-only operation is to transfer those duties to the driver so the driver would have full responsibility for dispatching the train. How that would work is that there are bodyside cameras that view down the side of the train and the driver would have to view down a set of monitors to check all the doors. There are issues relating to that because, particularly with very long formations of coaches, effectively 24 sets of doors, for the driver to do that in a short period of time. The images produced by the bodyside cameras are really unreliable, particularly in poor lighting, whether that be at night or just dusk or when it\u2019s overcast, particularly in the rain \u2013 even light drizzle has caused some of the images to be really poor. That\u2019s quite clearly an unsafe method of operation. The other thing of course, in terms of safety, is that the guard performs other safety duties, for example at a time when a driver might become incapacitated, particularly looking at worst case scenarios like in a train crash. The reality of a train crash is that the driver is often the first casualty; who is in place to ensure that safety duties are being conducted? That\u2019s the safety angle, but there is also a customer service issue. If you think about access for the disabled, there might be a Good Samaritan to help someone in a wheelchair on board, but not necessarily. What Southern have said is that they expect people with a disability to give them advance notice so there can be someone at the station. I think they have said 48 hours notice. That\u2019s frankly discrimination. I would suggest that\u2019s contrary to the Disability Discrimination Act. Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far: A strike by train drivers has brought Southern rail services to a complete halt after the court of appeal rejected a second attempt by the company to block the action. All of Southern\u2019s 2,242 weekday services have been cancelled, causing the worst disruption for more than 20 years. Judges upheld last week\u2019s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), that industrial action called by the train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, infringed rights under European law. GTR had already urged passengers not to travel on Tuesday, irrespective of the court\u2019s decision, warning that it would not be able to run a service. Transport secretary Chris Grayling dismissed the strike as \u201cfutile\u201d and threatened to introduce measures to restrict strikes on the rail network. He said: \u201cWe are thinking very carefully about how we take things forward. I\u2019m not going to rule anything in or anything out today.\u201d The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said passengers had been abandoned by the government and called on ministers to allow Transport for London to take control of Souther rail. Grayling dismissed the suggestion as \u201cnonsense\u201d. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, rejected government claims that the strike is political. He said: \u201cThis morning Chris Grayling claimed again that the action on Southern is political \u2013 it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s about safe train operation for both passengers and staff alike.\u201d Commuters are planning a demonstration outside the Department for Transport on Thursday. They are demanding that Grayling resign if he can\u2019t end the strike. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said it was an insult to passengers to blame Southern\u2019s failures on trade unions rather than the incompetence of management and government ministers. He said: \u201cThe truth is that ministers are defending this failed franchise as a point of political pride when they should be sticking up for taxpayers and commuters.\u201d Tory MP Nick Herbert, who represents many Southern commuters as MP for Arundel and South Downs, has backed measures to end strikes on the rail network. Speaking to BBC News he said: \u201cWe should look at what more can be done to prevent essential public services being disrupted in this way. It is deeply unfair on the travelling public and something really has got to be done about it.\u201d When it was pointed out that banning strikes would flout human rights laws, Herbert said: There are a range of things that could be looked at. For instance it might be possible to have some kind of \u2018no strike\u2019 agreement in return for compensation, or some kind of arrangement for binding arbitration on pay claims. There are options and they should be looked at, because what he have here is a few hundred militant staff effectively bringing a key public service to a standstill on a completely unreasonable demand. The former home office minister added: \u201cTheir claim is bogus, it is a political campaign. That\u2019s why the government does need to look at the options for dealing with it.\u201d The Association of British Commuters has set out its demands ahead of Thursday\u2019s protest outside the Department for Transport. It has three main demands: Urgent and transparent intervention into the industrial dispute. A fully independent public inquiry into the collapse of Southern rail. Transparency from the government in the form of answers to our crowdsourced questions. If these can\u2019t be met it is calling on Grayling to resign. It says: We demand that the secretary of state for transport not only intervenes but does so openly and transparently. Our message to the government is this: we are not only commuters, we are citizens for whom his department is responsible and we have urgent questions that need answering. The British public should know that southern commuters have experienced a year-long nightmare with the collapse of Southern rail. We have desperately called for government action and have been repeatedly ignored; even while many of us have lost our jobs, or relocated our homes because of it. Our thousands-strong network of commuters has been at the centre of this catastrophe throughout; and with the complete lack of government action on the matter, many have put all their efforts into investigating the true story behind the crisis. What is rotten in Southern rail started long before the current industrial action, which now takes place on top of a broken infrastructure, chronic understaffing and a company whose relations with the public have irretrievably broken [down]. Its relationship with the Department for Transport is that of a subcontractor, not a typical franchise; therefore, it is firmly within their remit to step in, and their urgent responsibility. We\u2019ve been hearing from commuters who have been forced to find alternative ways of getting into work, writes Rachel Obordo. Richard, from Tattenham Corner, had to spend extra time and money to get into central London. Another GuardianWitness contributor shares a picture of an overcrowded train. Despite the crush, reader GydaGwen, still supports the strikes The RMT\u2019s Steve Hedley insists the strike is about removing the \u201csafety critical\u201d role of guards on trains. Speaking to Damien Gayle at London Bridge he said hoped the government would allow Govia, which operates the Southern rail franchise, to negotiate in good faith. \u201cAs you can see there is a total shutdown today of the entire network,\u201d he said. The strike continues to divide politicians along party lines. Labour MP Rob Flello reacted with anger after Grayling suggested the government was considering changing union law to ban strikes on the rail network. Former Tory MP and children\u2019s minister Tim Loughton pointed out Labour\u2019s financial ties to the unions involved in the dispute. The SNP\u2019s Gavin Newlands calls for a more geographical perspective. Chris Grayling has dismissed Sadiq Khan\u2019s call to switch control of Southern to Transport for London as \u201csimply nonsense\u201d. Speaking to LBC he said: \u201cWhat the Mayor is doing is promising one thing to people inside London and another thing to people outside. \u201cThe Mayor\u2019s just said we\u2019ll provide faster more frequent services. Well the reality is if you get a suburban train in the morning, you know that these these tracks are jammed full. The challenge is getting any space for any more trains. He\u2019s also promised people outside London that he won\u2019t actually introduce more trains because of the fears outside London that actually there might be fewer services from the coast for example. So I don\u2019t buy this. \u201cHe\u2019s been Mayor for four and a half months, he\u2019s got some significant problems with Transport for London having big financial difficulties, the Piccadilly Line is in a state of chaos, he\u2019s running out of money for projects already in the pipeline and he\u2019s making grand promises about things like bridges over the Thames he hasn\u2019t got the money to build. \u201cSo I\u2019m afraid people should take what the Mayyor says with a pinch of salt. \u201cLet\u2019s concentrate this week on trying to get a resolution to the Southern rail dispute, which is all about services in Cambridge to Brighton not services that are just within London.\u201d Damien Gayle has been talking to pickets outside London Bridge station. One driver, who preferred not to be named, said the issue they were striking over was safety. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a 12 carriage train coming up from Brighton, it could have a thousand people onboard.\u201d One driver without a guard was not able to ensure the safety of so many passengers, he added. The Press Association has stories of commuter woe: A man who will miss telling his two young children a bedtime story because of the Southern strike is just one of the thousands of angry commuters to vent their frustrations. Jim Boyden, a management consultant, from Shoreham, West Sussex, said he will be forced to stay in a London hotel until Thursday because of the lack of trains between his home and Victoria. The 38-year-old shared a photo of his one-year-old son Zac and wrote an emotional tweet to Southern: \u201cBecause of your strike, I am unable to travel home until Thursday and read him and his sister a story. Because of your strike, we will not discover what animal is hiding in his favourite book tonight, or tomorrow night. \u201cBecause of your strike, he will be unable to take me by the hand and show me his favourite toy, which is ironically, a choo choo train. \u201cBecause of your strike, I will miss his smile. \u201cYou can refund me my Season Ticket. You can refund me my hotel. I can even make up time at work, but how \u2013 how \u2013 are you going to give me back the things money can\u2019t buy? \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, sort it out.\u201d Another parent who took to the social media site to complain was a mother whose six-year-old daughter was left in tears after a school trip to the British Museum was called off at the last minute due to the train chaos - which included problems on TfL\u2019s Victoria Underground line. Monica Corduff-Gonzalez, 44, from Forest Hill, south-east London, said: \u201cWith the anticipated extra pressure on the Overground created by there being no Southern service, and severe delays at Highbury and Islington, the school decided to postpone the trip to the new year. \u201cI was going to be going on the trip with my daughter and my husband was taking the day off work to look after my toddler. My daughter was super excited about the trip and having her mum with her, and there was flood of tears this morning at finding out the trip was cancelled for today.\u201d One commuter who usually uses Southern Rail to get from Sydenham in south-east London to King\u2019s Cross left the house more than two hours early to avoid overcrowding on the alternative Overground service. Carmen Butterworth left at 5.45am instead of 8am to avoid being late for work. Butterworth, 33, a personal assistant, told the Press Association: \u201cI knew that everyone would be forced to use the already overcrowded Overground and it would probably be a struggle to even board and I can\u2019t be late to work. \u201cThe blame doesn\u2019t just fall with Southern. However I do not think much of how they have handled the strike \u2013 telling half a million people not to attempt to travel on a work day isn\u2019t practical.\u201d People\u2019s tweets caused #southernstrike and #southernrail to trend on Twitter. Natasha Gourlay-Harris took to Twitter to call on Southern to refund her pre-paid 30 Christmas work lunch, which she feared she would miss because of the strike. Gourlay-Harris, 45, travels from Cheam, near Sutton, to London Victoria via Hackbridge and was stuck on a bus \u201cin appalling traffic\u201d for half an hour before finding the main entrance to Sutton station had been closed - with commuters being funnelled through a smaller second entrance. The personal assistant said: \u201cWhen will the Government step in?! I pay over 2,000 a year for a really awful service and then I read the company that owns Southern are taking in 90+ million in profits? It\u2019s criminal. And criminal that these profits are not going back into the system that makes all this money.\u201d Some car drivers have been tooting support for striking train drivers at the Selhurst depot picket in south London, PA\u2019s Jemma Crew reports. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has rejected London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s proposal to put Transport for London in charge of the suburban rail services currently run by Southern and other operators. In a letter to MPs, Grayling said: \u201cTransport for London has no experience of running a mainline railway like this.\u201d He also claimed the rail unions were being unreasonable. The letter says: \u201cI wish we were dealing with reasonable people on the union side. For all the shortcomings of the train operator \u2013 and there have been many \u2013 and the failures of the infrastructure \u2013 also many \u2013 it is difficult to resolve any of the other problems on this network while the union leadership seem hell bent on fermenting this dispute.\u201d At London Bridge station, a key Southern rail terminus, every platform was marked with a large red X, writes Damien Gayle. A few passengers were waiting, scratching their heads. Benan Yolcu, 21, a law and criminology student at Brighton University, said the strike had affected her \u201chorribly\u201d. \u201cI have an exam today and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to make it on time.\u201d She said she knew a strike was coming, but added: \u201cI thought it was not going to be today, and when I checked online [on a rail timetable app] it said that everything was running normally.\u201d She held up her phone to prove her point. Yolcu said she had no idea why the train drivers had gone on strike. Still, she had some sympathy for them. \u201cI understand that they might have their reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, [Brighton trains] every hour? Come on. People have things to do. I understand people have their situations, but other people have jobs.\u201d Departure boards at London Victoria and London Bridge make grim reading. Damien Gayle at London Bridge says there are very angry passengers on the concourse. His snap of the departure board explains why. If you\u2019ve been affected by the strike we\u2019d like to hear from you. Are you using alternative means to get into work or are you staying at home? If you won\u2019t be making it into the office, what are you doing instead?

The Green party joint leader, Caroline Lucas, urged ministers to do more to resolve the dispute. Labour\u2019s former shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher says the strike highlights systemic problems with the rail network. Shadow Welsh secretary, Jo Stevens, is also backing the strike. But the Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who had the party whip withdrawn after a sexting scandal, is sceptical about the strike. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has been giving a series of broadcast interviews expressing his view that the strike is \u201cfutile\u201d. His department has also posted a defiant video address in which Grayling says: \u201cWe are not prepared to end the modernisation of the railways.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t understand why the unions were so resistant to modern technology. Julian Glover, the former special adviser at the Department for Transport, insists the strike is about union pride and their control of the railways rather than safety as the unions claim. Commuters at Balham station are being forced to take taxis to work, writes Damien Gayle. Andrea Dunn, 24, and Gemma, who declined to give her surname, 32, were waiting outside Balham station to share an Uber taxi. \u201cWe\u2019re total strangers waiting to share an Uber now,\u201d Gemma said. Dunn, who works at Sky, said she had no idea what the strike action was about. But Gemma, who said she would miss a client meeting as a result of the strike, had stronger opinions. \u201cI\u2019m blaming the RMT,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they are too aggressive, too frequent.\u201d Asked what she knew about the reasons for the strike, Gemma said: \u201cTrain guards and locking doors, I think. Not having enough train guards; they want to take train guards away so there\u2019s no one to lock doors in person.\u201d Gemma\u2019s assessment of the strike was even shared by one Southern rail worker directing passengers to alternative routes. \u201cThese drivers are never happy, but they earn \u00a355k,\u201d the worker said. \u201cThey are making these problems up. I saw my manager \u2026 normally the RMT and him, they should be different things, right? But they go out for drinks together. It\u2019s all planned, we know that. \u201cThey are going to have a very nice Christmas.\u201d In his video message, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urged the government to give Transport for London control of commuter lines such as Southern, Southeastern and South West. Addressing commuters, he said: \u201cYou pay too much for delays, cancellations and disruption. You deserve a better service. Southern commuters have been abandoned by the government. You\u2019ve had months of chaos. But it doesn\u2019t have to be like this.\u201d The mayor urged commuters to write to the transport secretary and the prime minister for TfL to have control \u2013 promising a \u201cmore frequent and more reliable\u201d service \u201cwith fewer strikes\u201d and \u201cmore affordable fares\u201d. \u201cThis is far more important than party politics. Together we can secure the decent and affordable commute that you deserve.\u201d Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Grayling said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things after this is over we are going to have to take a careful look at. We can\u2019t leave our railways exposed. \u201cThere are issues on this line that go beyond just the issue of these strikes.\u201d Asked what he would do to stop future strikes, Grayling said: \u201cWe are thinking very carefully about how we take things forward. I\u2019m not going to rule anything in or anything out today. \u201cThere is a lot to think about when this strike is over. The important thing now is to get the services running again.\u201d Chris Grayling says the government will look \u201cvery carefully\u201d at possible changes to strike rules on railways to prevent the kind of action taking place today. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, claimed rail companies were trying to modernise the way they worked to give customers better services. \u201cHundreds of thousands of passengers are suffering needless disruption because of these strikes \u2013 despite independent expert evidence that safety isn\u2019t at risk. Trains where drivers close the doors are safe. \u201cThe truth is that these strikes are not about safety, not about jobs and not about customer service.\u201d Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers union Aslef, has accused Grayling of being \u201cless than honest on all counts\u201d, PA reports. He also referred to a speech made at a public meeting in Croydon earlier this year by a DfT official. \u201cEarlier this year Peter Wilkinson, the \u00a3265,000-a-year director of rail passenger services, said on a public platform that the aim of the DfT is to force train drivers \u2013 men and women he derisively referred to as \u2018muppets\u2019 \u2013 \u2018out of my industry\u2019. \u201cMr Wilkinson said he was determined to provoke industrial confrontation and, indeed, was looking forward to \u2018punch-ups\u2019 with trade unions. \u201cThe strikes this week are not, whatever Mr Grayling tries to suggest, politically motivated. We have a trade dispute with GTR/Southern, and only a poor government would seek to spin it any other way. I think their motives are clear.\u201d Back on Balham station, Joseph Volcy, 32, is wondering how he will get to work at a digital marketing company. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know [about the strike] and it\u2019s awful. By the way I\u2019m seeing it I won\u2019t get to work until 11am, because it\u2019s in Kingston. \u201cI need to get on my phone, talk to all my clients one by one. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time. I\u2019m really disappointed. The train is never on time, sometimes it says it\u2019s coming and just disappears. I\u2019m thinking I have to move house. It\u2019s bad because it really affects your morale.\u201d The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has accused the government of abandoning Southern rail commuters. Damien Gayle has been talking to angry commuters at Balham station in south London. Jessica Knight, 23, was on her way to work at Saviles estate agent in Richmond. \u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the arse,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to work from home. My boss won\u2019t be happy. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise it was completely not working. It\u2019s really annoying because there\u2019s so many people trying to get to work and do their jobs. They need to sort it out really.\u201d Asked if she had any sympathy for those taking strike action, she replied: \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, has rejected government claims that the strike is political and urged Chris Grayling to end a \u201cmisinformation\u201d campaign about the action. In a statement he said: This morning Chris Grayling claimed again that the action on Southern is political \u2013 it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s about safe train operation for both passengers and staff alike. The transport secretary wants to ask himself why the unions have been able to resolve disputes and reach agreements on Scotrail and elsewhere if our motivation is purely political. Mr Grayling also claimed again that the RSSB is an independent safety body - it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s funded by the private train companies. Finally, Mr Grayling claimed that there is a campaign of unofficial action organised by the unions \u2013 there isn\u2019t, and the evidence points to Southern sabotaging services to try and turn the blame on to the staff.\u201d Now is the time for Chris Grayling to make it clear that all of that rhetoric and misinformation is being swept away and that both him and his contractors, GTR, are serious about talks with the unions involved in today\u2019s action. Cash\u2019s statement added: RMT drivers on Southern rail are standing shoulder to shoulder with their Aslef colleagues this morning in a fight for safe train operation. This strike action is wholly the responsibility of a government and a company that have sought to bulldoze through changes that are ill-conceived, finance-led and fraught with danger. RMT remembers only too well the words of top government transport official Peter Wilkinson who told Southern passengers he wanted a punch-up with the unions, that train drivers were muppets and that he would starve our members back to work. That was the top government rail official making it clear he was hellbent on confrontation and it is that position which has led us to today\u2019s shutdown. Welcome to our live coverage of the latest Southern rail strike, which looks set to be the most disruptive yet. The strike by train drivers has brought services to a complete halt after the court of appeal rejected a second attempt by the rail company to block the action. Judges upheld last week\u2019s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), that industrial action called by the train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, infringed rights under European law. All of Southern\u2019s 2,242 weekday services have been cancelled, causing the worst disruption for more than 20 years. Aslef members have mounted picket lines outside stations at the start of the 48-hour walkout in a dispute over driver-only trains. Another strike is planned for Friday. Commuters are planning a protest outside the Department for Transport on Thursday evening. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has continued to blame the unions for the months of disruption to Southern services and urged them to sit down with the company to resolve long-running disputes over driver-only trains and changes to the role of conductors. But Aslef and the Rail, Maritime and Transport union attacked the government, saying ministers had been preventing Southern from negotiating properly.",

Speaking to Damien Gayle he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s important to understand that it would be quite a crass oversimplification of the dispute to boil it down to one issue. </p> <p>It\u2019s multifaceted, but safety is certainly one of the key factors and that\u2019s in terms of operational safety of the railway. At the moment we have trains that are dispatched by the guard or conductor and the guard is responsible for monitoring the safe dispatch of those trains.</p> <p>The guard will ensure it is safe to dispatch those trains and will tell the driver it\u2019s safe to do so.</p> <p>What they are looking to do under driver-only operation is to transfer those duties to the driver so the driver would have full responsibility for dispatching the train. How that would work is that there are bodyside cameras that view down the side of the train and the driver would have to view down a set of monitors to check all the doors.</p> <p>There are issues relating to that because, particularly with very long formations of coaches, effectively 24 sets of doors, for the driver to do that in a short period of time. The images produced by the bodyside cameras are really unreliable, particularly in poor lighting, whether that be at night or just dusk or when it\u2019s overcast, particularly in the rain \u2013 even light drizzle has caused some of the images to be really poor. That\u2019s quite clearly an unsafe method of operation. </p> <p>The other thing of course, in terms of safety, is that the guard performs other safety duties, for example at a time when a driver might become incapacitated, particularly looking at worst case scenarios like in a train crash.</p> <p>The reality of a train crash is that the driver is often the first casualty; who is in place to ensure that safety duties are being conducted?</p> <p>That\u2019s the safety angle, but there is also a customer service issue. If you think about access for the disabled, there might be a Good Samaritan to help someone in a wheelchair on board, but not necessarily. What Southern have said is that they expect people with a disability to give them advance notice so there can be someone at the station. I think they have said 48 hours notice.

On many occasions I have spent the morning on the way to work far too close to many of the other commuters who are desperate to get to work and not be late in order to keep their job. This brings me into the southern railway strike which is happening in London today. Many people are unhappy with their jobs however most of us still get up in the morning and make our way to work in order to make a living and ensure that we have food to put on the table for our families and ourselves. Multitudes of people are in desperate need of a job and I am sure that if the people on the trains are unhappy then they can leave their jobs and someone else will take their place. I am a strong believer that if you are unhappy you need to make a change, I do however believe that we should appreciate what we have and been thoughtful to others in the world as well who are also trying to make a living. London transport needs to run smoother, but it is with the help of everyone as a team which can make this happen. The drivers going against the people whose money goes into the system and pays their wages is not the way to go about it.  As seen in the photo above people are even standing on the top deck? Therefore everyone&#39;s safety has also been compromised due to this strike. Change needs to happen but we needn&#39;t to work together in order to make it successful for us all. It is as if people in this world have forgotten how to talk to each other.</p> </div>   </figcaption>  </div> <footer class=\"element-witness--footer\"> <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\" class=\"element-witness--brand\" itemprop=\"provider\">GuardianWitness</a></p> <div class=\"element-witness--metadata\"> <p class=\"element-witness--author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">  By  <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Piinkbezzi\" class=\"element-witness--author-name\" itemprop=\"name\">Piinkbezzi</a> </p> <p class=\"element-witness--date\"> <time itemprop=\"dateCreated\" datetime=\"2016-12-13T09:55:38Z\">13 December 2016, 9:55</time> </p> </div> </footer>  </figure>  <p>Despite the crush, reader GydaGwen, still supports the strikes</p>  <figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-text\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebPageElement\" data-canonical-url=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/584fa5dae4b0e02f2b16b929/5017468\"> <div class=\"element-witness--main\">    <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/584fa5dae4b0e02f2b16b929/5017468\" itemprop=\"url\">Inconvenienced but supportive</a></h3>  <div itemprop=\"text\"> <p>I managed to get a very busy Thameslink to work this morning but others weren&#39;t so lucky.

My daughter was super excited about the trip and having her mum with her, and there was flood of tears this morning at finding out the trip was cancelled for today.\u201d </p> <p>One commuter who usually uses Southern Rail to get from Sydenham in south-east London to King\u2019s Cross left the house more than two hours early to avoid overcrowding on the alternative Overground service. </p> <p>Carmen Butterworth left at 5.45am instead of 8am to avoid being late for work. </p> <p>Butterworth, 33, a personal assistant, told the Press Association: \u201cI knew that everyone would be forced to use the already overcrowded Overground and it would probably be a struggle to even board and I can\u2019t be late to work. </p> <p>\u201cThe blame doesn\u2019t just fall with Southern. However I do not think much of how they have handled the strike \u2013 telling half a million people not to attempt to travel on a work day isn\u2019t practical.\u201d </p> <p>People\u2019s tweets caused #southernstrike and #southernrail to trend on Twitter. </p> <p>Natasha Gourlay-Harris took to Twitter to call on Southern to refund her pre-paid 30 Christmas work lunch, which she feared she would miss because of the strike. </p> <p>Gourlay-Harris, 45, travels from Cheam, near Sutton, to London Victoria via Hackbridge and was stuck on a bus \u201cin appalling traffic\u201d for half an hour before finding the main entrance to Sutton station had been closed - with commuters being funnelled through a smaller second entrance. </p> <p>The personal assistant said: \u201cWhen will the Government step in?! I pay over 2,000 a year for a really awful service and then I read the company that owns Southern are taking in 90+ million in profits? It\u2019s criminal. And criminal that these profits are not going back into the system that makes all this money.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T13:27:08.668Z\">at 1.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-584fc69fe4b025760cee4518\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T10:01:48.217Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some car drivers have been tooting support for striking train drivers at the Selhurst depot picket in south London, PA\u2019s Jemma Crew reports.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jemmacrew/status/808606824970784768\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Passing cars hoot in support of drivers on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/southernstrike?src=hash\">#southernstrike</a> picket line outside Selhurst depot <a href=\"https://t.co/X23fOvG5jv\">pic.twitter.com/X23fOvG5jv</a></p>&mdash; Jemma Crew (@jemmacrew) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jemmacrew/status/808606824970784768\">December 13, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T10:13:26.444Z\">at 10.13am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-584fc381e4b077e984850648\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2016-12-13T09:57:22.153Z\">9.57am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has rejected London mayor <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/sadiq-khan-for-commuters-sake-the-government-must-let-us-run-the-railways-a3414416.html\">Sadiq Khan\u2019s proposal</a> to put Transport for London in charge of the suburban rail services currently run by Southern and other operators.</p> <p>In a letter to MPs, Grayling said: \u201cTransport for London has no experience of running a mainline railway like this.\u201d</p> <p>He also claimed the rail unions were being unreasonable.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Union leaders are calling on the Post Office to halt closures and take part in \u201cmeaningful talks\u201d on jobs and pension cuts to avert five days of strike action planned ahead of Christmas. Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which acts for about 4,000 postal workers, said: \u201cWe will be tabling a fresh proposal to the Post Office and government within 24 hours. Our ambition is to avoid any strike action. For this to happen, the Post Office and government need to enter into serious negotiations on the future of the Post Office.\u201d The Post Office has said next week\u2019s strike will have minimal impact on Christmas mail, but that claim is disputed by the postal workers\u2019 unions. The government-backed post office operator said less than 3% of its outlets would be affected by the action expected to start from 19 December. But the CWU, which is protesting over pay, pension and job cuts, said more than a fifth of parcels were handled by the 300 crown post offices where its members work. A spokesman for the union accused the Post Office of \u201cgiving the public a false sense of security\u201d. He said that the crown offices, which are run directly by Post Office employees involved in the strike, were based in key cities, such as Manchester, London and Birmingham, and were far larger than the thousands of local offices run by independent business people. But Kevin Gilliland, the network and sales director for the Post Office, said: \u201cIt will be business as usual in almost all of our network, with over 50,000 Post Office people on hand to support customers as they make their preparations for Christmas.\u201d He said the Post Office was extremely disappointed that the CWU preferred to call for strike action, despite the company\u2019s pledge to return to talks on Wednesday. Royal Mail, which handles parcel and letter deliveries and is now a private company after it was split off from the Post Office several years ago, said it expected the action to have little or no effect on the services it provides its customers. But the CWU disagreed, saying: \u201cThe Royal Mail has got to have parcels and if you can\u2019t go to your local Post Office to drop them off then they won\u2019t be there to deliver.\u201d However, it is possible that this round of strikes by the CWU, which has been embroiled in the dispute with the Post Office for more than a year, will not have as much impact as previous action. Unlike a series of strikes earlier this year, Unite, the union which acts for 700 Post Office managers, is not taking part this time. Unite\u2019s officer for the Post Office, Brian Scott, said: \u201cWe are due to meet with the company on 22 December, at a senior level, and so we feel it is not appropriate to take further action in advance of that. These discussions are part of our efforts to find a solution to the dispute.\u201d But he added: \u201cThis does not undermine our support for the CWU campaign to get an impetus for a refreshed Post Office that will make it sustainable, including the call for a PostBank. This debate should include government.\u201d The strike action comes after the Post Office confirmed plans to transfer more than 60 of its largest outlets to the private sector. Along with other cost-cutting proposals, the closures will lead to the loss of about 2,000 of its 6,600-strong workforce in crown branches, back office and cash handling. About half the Post Office\u2019s total workforce is also being forced to shift from a final salary pension scheme to a defined contribution scheme, which unions say could cut retirement benefits by 30% or more in some cases.",

      "body": "<p>Union leaders are calling on the Post Office to halt closures and take part in \u201cmeaningful talks\u201d on jobs and pension cuts to avert five days of strike action planned ahead of Christmas.</p> <p>Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, which acts for about 4,000 postal workers, said: \u201cWe will be tabling a fresh proposal to the Post Office and government within 24 hours. Our ambition is to avoid any strike action. For this to happen, the Post Office and government need to enter into serious negotiations on the future of the Post Office.\u201d</p> <p>The Post Office has said next week\u2019s strike will have minimal impact on Christmas mail, but that claim is disputed by the postal workers\u2019 unions.</p> <p>The government-backed post office operator said less than 3% of its outlets would be affected by the action expected to start from 19 December. But the CWU, which is protesting over pay, pension and job cuts, said more than a fifth of parcels were handled by the 300 crown post offices where its members work.</p> <p>A spokesman for the union accused the Post Office of \u201cgiving the public a false sense of security\u201d.</p> <p>He said that the crown offices, which are run directly by Post Office employees involved in the strike, were based in key cities, such as Manchester, London and Birmingham, and were far larger than the thousands of local offices run by independent business people.</p> <p>But Kevin Gilliland, the network and sales director for the Post Office, said: \u201cIt will be business as usual in almost all of our network, with over 50,000 Post Office people on hand to support customers as they make their preparations for Christmas.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/12/post-office-workers-to-stage-five-days-of-strikes-next-week\">Post Office workers to stage five days of strikes next week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said the Post Office was extremely disappointed that the CWU preferred to call for strike action, despite the company\u2019s pledge to return to talks on Wednesday.</p> <p>Royal Mail, which handles parcel and letter deliveries and is now a private company after it was split off from the Post Office several years ago, said it expected the action to have little or no effect on the services it provides its customers.</p> <p>But the CWU disagreed, saying: \u201cThe Royal Mail has got to have parcels and if you can\u2019t go to your local Post Office to drop them off then they won\u2019t be there to deliver.\u201d</p> <p>However, it is possible that this round of strikes by the CWU, which has been embroiled in the dispute with the Post Office for more than a year, will not have as much impact as previous action.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/14/more-than-300-post-offices-24-hour-walkout-strike\">Unlike a series of strikes earlier this year</a>, Unite, the union which acts for 700 Post Office managers, is not taking part this time.</p> <p>Unite\u2019s officer for the Post Office, Brian Scott, said: \u201cWe are due to meet with the company on 22 December, at a senior level, and so we feel it is not appropriate to take further action in advance of that. These discussions are part of our efforts to find a solution to the dispute.\u201d</p> <p>But he added: \u201cThis does not undermine our support for the CWU campaign to get an impetus for a refreshed Post Office that will make it sustainable, including the call for a PostBank. This debate should include government.\u201d</p> <p>The strike action comes after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/post-office-to-move-up-to-61-branches-to-wh-smith\">Post Office confirmed plans to transfer more than 60 of its largest outlets to the private sector</a>. Along with other cost-cutting proposals, the closures will lead to the loss of about 2,000 of its 6,600-strong workforce in crown branches, back office and cash handling. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/14/post-office-pension-benefits-cut-defined-contribution\">About half the Post Office\u2019s total workforce is also being forced to shift from a final salary pension scheme</a> to a defined contribution scheme, which unions say could cut retirement benefits by 30% or more in some cases.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A group of Sky shareholders has called for \u201crobust\u201d safeguards to protect its \u201cfuture probity\u201d under full ownership by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox. The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, an association of 71 funds that control about 0.7% of Sky, also called for regulator Ofcom to be called in to examine potential media plurality issues before Fox\u2019s \u00a311.2bn takeover is given the green light. The proposed deal, which could be formally tabled as early as this week, will result in Murdoch owning 100% of Sky through 21st Century Fox as well as the Times, Sunday Times, Sun and radio station TalkSport through separate newspaper and book publishing company News Corp. Murdoch\u2019s previous bid to take full control of Sky was derailed in 2011 at the height of the phone-hacking scandal that engulfed the now-closed News of the World. \u201cAny recommendation by the board in favour would have to be based on an appropriate premium as well as safeguards for future probity given the past track records of the businesses controlled by the Murdochs,\u201d said LAPFF. \u201cFurther clarity may also be needed so that public shareholders have full confidence that proposals are not being unduly influenced by the well-known relationships between Sky and 21st Century Fox.\u201d LAPFF has in the past challenged the independence of board members and raised governance issues at Sky, most recently in January following the controversial reappointment of James Murdoch as chairman. Assuming Fox moves to formally table a bid for Sky then Karen Bradley, the culture secretary, then has 10 working days to decide whether to ask Ofcom to investigate the deal to assess any media plurality issues. Most observers expect Bradley to call for a public interest test. Her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, did so with the result that Sky News was offered up to be split off to address plurality concerns and avoid a full competition investigation. \u201cThe role of Ofcom would be helpful in bringing its expert scrutiny on a deal that will have a broader impact on the future of the broadcasting and print media marketplace in the UK,\u201d said Kieran Quinn, chairman of LAPFF. LAPFF also became the latest shareholder to question whether Fox\u2019s proposed offer undervalues the company. A committee of independent Sky board directors, led by Martin Gilbert, the deputy chairman and chief of Aberdeen Asset Management, tentatively recommended shareholders accept the Fox offer. \u201cAll directors of Sky have a duty not to disadvantage the public shareholders,\u201d said Quinn. \u201cThe position of the non-executives will need to be robust to ensure that the premium paid is appropriate and that shareholders are not disadvantaged by any temporary low in the share price.\u201d Fox has agreed to pay a premium of 36% on Sky\u2019s closing price on Thursday, the day before the proposed bid was announced. However, Sky\u2019s shares were trading above that level as recently as February. Investors including Royal London Asset Management and Jupiter Asset Management have already queried the offer price. Crispin Odey, who as head of Odey Asset Management owns a Sky stake, said that he does not believe that Fox will pay more than its existing offer. However, Thomas Singlehurst, an analyst at Citi, said there is a chance of a bump up in the offer price. \u201cOur own view is that the bid is opportunistic in nature and the price offered \u2013 and tentatively agreed by the independent directors \u2013 does not represent fair value for the shares, which we see at at least \u00a313.50 per share,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is, however, that it is a significant premium to the undisturbed price and our discussions with investors (as well as the high trading volumes) suggest that many may be willing to take the offer. This does not exclude the potential for a small sweetener, but this is far from guaranteed.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "No trains are running at all on Southern\u2019s network on Tuesday morning, leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers in Sussex, Surrey and beyond stranded. It is the biggest strike on the railways since privatisation in 1994, as drivers from the Aslef union have followed conductors from the RMT in taking industrial action in the long-running dispute on Britain\u2019s biggest commuter franchise. When are the strikes? The drivers\u2019 strikes \u2013 which have the biggest effect, stopping all Southern trains \u2013 started on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday 14 December and Friday 16 December. Another six-day walkout is scheduled from Monday 9 January. Conductors will strike on Monday 19 and Tuesday 20 December and from New Year\u2019s Eve until Monday 2 January. Drivers have also voted for an indefinite overtime ban, which will severely disrupt services every day, even without strikes. Why are the latest strikes taking place? The dispute is over driver-only operation of trains on the franchise. That means changes to the role of conductors, who are now being rebranded as \u201conboard supervisors\u201d. They will no longer close the doors on new trains being brought into operation. Unions claim that this practice is unsafe, and fear that once the safety-critical tasks of the conductor are removed, jobs will be at risk. Although Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), has promised not to axe jobs, and says it will normally run trains with a second staff member aboard, it wants to retain the right to run trains with one. Aslef had attempted to join the RMT strikes from the beginning of the dispute in spring, but was blocked by a court injunction won by GTR. Is driver-only operation of trains unsafe? GTR, the Rail Safety and Standards Board and most of the industry says it is safe, and points out that it is longstanding practice in some parts of the rail network, including in Southern\u2019s sister Thameslink services in the wider GTR franchise. Unions question the independence of the safety board, whose directors include GTR\u2019s chief executive, and argue that the conditions of modern railways \u2013 with longer trains and far more passengers \u2013 are not comparable to the days when they accepted the principle of one crew member on board. Drivers\u2019 union Aslef argues that CCTV does not give the same level of oversight as a conductor would have in closing the doors. What other factors are causing disruption on Southern? As commuters are well aware, problems long pre-date the strikes. Management admitted to staff shortages when its franchise started, but the poor situation has been made worse by the need to take out more drivers to act as trainers, or to be trained themselves on the new rolling stock. Higher than usual levels of sickness \u2013 labelled by Southern and the government as unofficial industrial action, to the fury of unions \u2013 has further worsened the situation. Much of the network, including the Brighton mainline, is regarded as having insufficient capacity to run enough trains for the demand. Large-scale engineering works, including the overhaul of London Bridge, have been another source of major disruption. Random events such as breakdowns, flooding and sinkholes have also struck the luckless Southern, and with resources stretched to the limit and staff goodwill broken down, the knock-on effects of such incidents can be more extreme. Is there an end in sight to the dispute? Only the scale of the disruption and the public outcry would suggest action is imminent \u2013 otherwise, the rift between unions and the train company and the government is wider than ever. GTR have in theory offered talks at Acas on Tuesday, but only on condition that unions abandon their strikes. But Aslef said that the company had been unwilling to negotiate until the strikes were reality. Previous talks between the RMT and GTR have collapsed. Both sides have claimed talks are pointless because neither will come without preconditions. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has only offered a meeting if unions commit to abandoning strike action \u2013 but has also said he will not get involved in direct talks. In any case, after Grayling told MPs on Monday that Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, had \u201cpromised 10 years of strikes\u201d, Whelan responded that Grayling was lying and betraying a private meeting \u2013 and said the breakdown in trust was now total, and extended to the government. Unions say that overwhelming votes to strike reflect widespread anger at management practices on the franchise. One possible reason for optimism is that unions recently reached a negotiated settlement with Scotrail in a similar dispute, albeit in a very different political environment. Who is to blame? Most commuters think neither the RMT nor the management are blameless. Unions are seeking guarantees over future roles that appear to be untenable. Southern has clearly had some management problems. Meanwhile ,Grayling \u2013 who was revealed last week to have suggested blocking Transport for London taking over more rail commuter services in the capital, a move supported by all parties, because it would come under the control of a Labour mayor \u2013 certainly isn\u2019t making industrial relations any easier. But the broader context is that government has been looking to cut costs and bring in more automation on the rail network. Trains have been ordered with a view to driver-only operation, and franchises structured on the basis such changes are made. Speeches by senior rail officials at the Department for Transport have further exposed the government\u2019s wider agenda, which unions fear will spread across the country. That may be a path to cheaper railways, but unions fear it will mean job losses, and that \u2013 for all the assurances on Southern now \u2013 future franchises will not have a second crew member on board.",

The FTSE 100 is 13.21 points higher at 6903.63, with ITV leading the way on hopes it could be a takeover target following the bid for Sky from Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox. The free-to-air broadcaster is up 6.2p at 191.4p and although 9.9% shareholder Liberty Global has seemingly played down talk of making a move, analysts have suggested US group Viacom could be interested after a merger with CBS was abandoned. Elsewhere British Airways owner International Airlines Group has climbed 12p to 444.5p after Panmure analysts began coverage, saying: IAG probably merits core holding status in this space given strong market positions and management track record. We are cautious on UK demand, and our flattish 2017 profit forecast, although free cash flow of 12% is attractive. We are wary of cost saving and shareholder return expectations running high whilst the new BA Captain [Alex Cruz] has it all to prove. We initiate with a hold rating and 450p target price. Housebuilders have been lifted by a positive update from Bellway, 56p better at \u00a324.26, with Taylor Wimpey adding 2.2p to 151.8p and Persimmon putting on 15p to \u00a316.82. Banking shares across Europe have been boosted by the \u20ac13bn cash call from Italy\u2019s Unicredit, with Barclays 1.05p better at 228.6p and Lloyds Banking Group 0.5% higher at 61.71p despite the UK government trimming its stake again. Among the fallers Antofagasta is 21.5p lower at 753p as copper dipped ahead of Wednesday\u2019s US interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, widely expected to see the first increase in borrowing costs for a year. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, said: [The] Federal Reserve Open Markets committee meeting continues to dominate market sentiment, with many worrying that we could see something similar to last year, where a rate hike marked the beginning of a sustained correction in the Dow. However, we are looking at a different situation, with markets perceiving a rate hike as a near certainty. There is a good chance that a rate hike is fully priced in and as such the real interest will come from how the FOMC sets out their plan for 2017. Meanwhile the strong UK inflation figures are likely to dispel any talk of another Bank of England rate cut, which is helping to support the pound. The rise in oil prices is also expected to continue feeding through into the inflation figures. Precious metal miner Fresnillo has fallen 28p to \u00a311.17 while Randgold Resources is down 115p to \u00a356.65 as gold and silver prices slipped back. Among the mid-caps Balfour Beatty is up 6.5p at 280.6p as it issued a positive trading statement. Analysts at Liberum said: We believe that Balfours is well placed to benefit from increased infrastructure investment both sides of the Atlantic. We do not overly worry about the impact of rising yields on infrastructure values. A recovered PE of 9.0 times is attractive. But energy services group Hunting is down 6% at 591p after its latest update, saying its 2017 outcome was highly dependent on a continued and sustained improvement of both north American and international markets.",

In the three months to 4 December, deflation in the grocery market fell to its lowest level since September 2014, according to industry data from Kantar Worldpanel, narrowing from a 0.5% drop reported last month. Despite near flat prices overall, Tesco was the only one of the big four supermarkets to record sales growth, according to Kantar, up 1.6% but still a slowdown from the 2.2% reported last month. Sales fell at Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Morrisons, by 0.6%, 4.7% and 1.4% respectively, but all three improved their performance compared with last month as shoppers snapped up their premium own-label ranges ahead of Christmas. Fraser McKevitt, of Kantar Worldpanel, said Morrisons\u2019 The Best and Asda\u2019s Extra Special put on particularly impressive performances, with sales increasing by 35% and 15% respectively. In contrast, there was a further slowdown in sales growth at discounters Aldi and Lidl. Although Aldi is still the fastest-growing chain in the market, with sales up 10%, Lidl\u2019s pace of growth slipped to 5.7%, from 6.1% last month. For the second month in a row it was outpaced by the British discounter Iceland, where sales rose 8.6%. The discounters are coming under pressure after the big four cut prices on key lines in a bid to fight back more effectively. Meanwhile, as inflation has begun to kick in as a result of the falling value of the pound against the euro and the dollar since the Brexit vote, the discounters have been forced to put up the price of basics, including milk and bananas. Data from another market research agency, Nielsen, suggested grocery market sales in the four weeks to 3 December had fallen by 0.4% as the volume of goods slid 0.3% \u2013 the first time sales and volumes had dropped since July. Mike Watkins, Nielsen\u2019s UK head of retailer and business insight, put this down to the distraction of Black Friday, the US-inspired discount day in late November, which he said had encouraged shoppers to buy non-food items elsewhere. Watkins said he expected momentum to build in the runup to Christmas, helped by Christmas Eve falling on a Saturday. Nielsen estimates shoppers will spend around \u00a34bn at supermarkets in the final week, with 22 December expected to be the biggest day of the year. \u201cThis year should end on a bit of a high note, with more visits that week, and sales up versus last year despite the ongoing price deflation,\u201d he said.",

Bellway had suspended its acquisition programme to protect itself from potential market volatility arising from the referendum result in June. Reservations, which involve homebuyers paying a fee to reserve a property, rose 7% in the four months to early December, to 176 a week. Bellway said it expected to build 5% more homes in the current financial year which ends on 31 July 2017. \u201cWhilst remaining mindful of the longer term uncertainty as a result of the vote to leave the EU, the positive autumn trading performance has given the board reassurance to cautiously recommence the group\u2019s programme of land acquisition, following a brief planned hiatus in the weeks after the referendum,\u201d the Newcastle-based company said. In a trading update for the 18 weeks to 4 December, Bellway said it had entered into contracts to buy 40 new sites and had spent \u00a3263m on land. Ted Ayres, the chief executive, said the outlook for UK housing demand was strong, boosted by low mortgage rates and the government\u2019s help to buy equity loan scheme, which will be closed by the end of the year. The scheme was used in in 37% of Bellway\u2019s reservations during the four-month period, up from 29% a year earlier. Ayres said: \u201cThe group has made an encouraging start to the financial year and customer demand for new homes continues to be robust. The strength of the underlying housing market supports further growth.\u201d Bellway said selling prices were in line with expectations: \u201cThe pricing environment is firm across the country in those areas where the group has a presence, with sales prices achieved on reservations in line with expectations. In London, where Bellway\u2019s focus continues to be on affordably priced new homes, prices have remained stable and demand robust.\u201d The update from Bellway is the latest sign that British consumers have so far shrugged off uncertainty arising from the Brexit vote.

    "webTitle": "Inflation hits highest level in more than two years", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "UK inflation climbed to 1.2% in November, the highest level in more than two years, in a sign that the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote is fuelling a rise in the cost of living. The rise in the consumer prices index, from 0.9% in October, was largely driven by higher petrol and clothing prices according to the Office for National Statistics. November\u2019s rate was the highest since October 2014, and slightly above the 1.1% forecast by City economists. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, said rising inflation posed a threat to living standards in the UK. \u201cWorking people are facing over a decade of lost wage growth, with rising prices hitting their pay packets again. The government needs to act fast to avoid another living standards crisis. That means a clear plan for Brexit that will protect jobs, pay and rights.\u201d Economists said the rise in the headline inflation rate suggested a weaker pound was pushing up consumer prices by making imports more expensive. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank, said: \u201cThere was a scattering of monthly increases for exchange rate sensitive components that were higher than the seasonal norm. This to me represents the early signs of the pound\u2019s depreciation feeding into the inflation data. There is plenty more where that came from.\u201d Economists, including those at the Bank of England, have warned that inflation is likely to rise sharply in 2017, to about 3%, putting increased pressure on household finances. Richard Lim, chief executive at the consultancy Retail Economics, said shops faced a choice between passing rising costs on to consumers, taking a hit on margins, or passing them on elsewhere in the supply chain. \u201cMost retailers will use a combination of all three to distribute the impact of rising input costs but households will have to share some of the pain,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much pain and how quickly it feeds through will be critical in determining the strength of spending next year.\u201d Higher inflation in 2017 is expected to coincide with a period of poor wage growth, rising unemployment and weaker economic growth all adding to the pressure on household finances. Higher prices for winter coats were largely behind a 1.6% increase in the cost of clothing between October and November. Petrol prices increased by 1.6p a litre between October and November this year, but fell by 1.5p a litre a year ago. Other items contributing to higher inflation in November were leather sofas, bleach, pizza, computers and printers. Some manufacturers of IT equipment said the weaker pound was pushing up prices because products were usually priced in dollars. ONS figures also showed the prices paid by manufacturers for materials and energy continued to rise at a brisk pace on a year ago. They were up 12.9% from November 2015, the biggest rise for five years. They appeared to pass some of that on to clients, with output prices up 2.3% in November on a year ago, the biggest rise since April 2012. The ONS said recent moves in the pound had fed through into firms\u2019 costs and charges made to their customers and \u201cto a lesser extent\u201d into some components of the consumer prices index that tend to be imported, such as fuel. Statisticians also said the drop in the pound had amplified the effect on inflation from a rise in global oil prices. Mike Cherry, national chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, said higher costs were hitting companies. \u201cOur members have so far managed to absorb the increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures but the effects are now beginning to bite. Many small businesses rely on road travel to transport goods, receive supplies and for their staff to get to work so the rising cost of petrol is a major concern.\u201d Responding to the inflation data, the Treasury said: \u201cThe economy remains fundamentally strong with taxes cut for millions of working people and the employment rate at a record high. The autumn statement set out support for an economy that works for everyone, as we adjust to our new relationship with the EU.\u201d",

This to me represents the early signs of the pound\u2019s depreciation feeding into the inflation data. There is plenty more where that came from.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/03/bank-of-england-rate-cuts-2017-growth-forecast-inflation\">Economists, including those at the Bank of England, have warned that inflation is likely to rise sharply in 2017</a>, to about 3%, putting increased pressure on household finances.</p> <p>Richard Lim, chief executive at the consultancy Retail Economics, said shops faced a choice between passing rising costs on to consumers, taking a hit on margins, or passing them on elsewhere in the supply chain. </p> <p>\u201cMost retailers will use a combination of all three to distribute the impact of rising input costs but households will have to share some of the pain,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much pain and how quickly it feeds through will be critical in determining the strength of spending next year.\u201d</p> <p>Higher inflation in 2017 is expected to coincide with a period of poor wage growth, rising unemployment and weaker economic growth all adding to the pressure on household finances. </p> <p>Higher prices for winter coats were largely behind a 1.6% increase in the cost of clothing between October and November. Petrol prices increased by 1.6p a litre between October and November this year, but fell by 1.5p a litre a year ago.</p> <p>Other items contributing to higher inflation in November were leather sofas, bleach, pizza, computers and printers. Some manufacturers of IT equipment said the weaker pound was pushing up prices because products were usually priced in dollars. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/producerpriceinflation/nov2016\">ONS figures</a> also showed the prices paid by manufacturers for materials and energy continued to rise at a brisk pace on a year ago. They were up 12.9% from November 2015, the biggest rise for five years. <br></p> <p>They appeared to pass some of that on to clients, with output prices up 2.3% in November on a year ago, the biggest rise since April 2012.<br></p> <p>The ONS said <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/additionalanalysisoftheproducerpriceindexppiandconsumerpriceindexcpi/nov2016\">recent moves in the pound had fed through into firms\u2019 costs and charges made to their customers</a> and \u201cto a lesser extent\u201d into some components of the consumer prices index that tend to be imported, such as fuel. Statisticians also said the drop in the pound had amplified the effect on inflation from a rise in global oil prices.</p> <p>Mike Cherry, national chairman at the Federation of Small Businesses, said higher costs were hitting companies. \u201cOur members have so far managed to absorb the increased costs resulting from inflationary pressures but the effects are now beginning to bite. Many small businesses rely on road travel to transport goods, receive supplies and for their staff to get to work so the rising cost of petrol is a major concern.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the inflation data, the Treasury said: \u201cThe economy remains fundamentally strong with taxes cut for millions of working people and the employment rate at a record high.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Southern rail strike affecting hundreds of thousands of commuters is \u201cpalpable nonsense\u201d, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has said, maintaining his hardline stance on the industrial action. As trains run by the franchise came to a halt on Tuesday morning, Grayling told BBC News that the drivers\u2019 strike was politically motivated and that \u201cmilitant\u201d unions were trying to bring the rail network to its knees. The transport secretary wrote to MPs on Monday telling them rail union leaders had promised him \u201c10 years of industrial action\u201d at their first meeting. \u201cWhen I met the general secretary of Aslef soon after my appointment, with virtually his first breath he promised me \u201810 years of industrial action\u2019. I have therefore believed it better to avoid direct ministerial involvement in negotiations during the autumn, as my involvement would make the issue even more political than it is.\u201d Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday, Grayling was asked if the government might change the law to prevent similar strikes taking place in the future. \u201cI think there is a lot of things after this is over that we are going to have to take a careful look at because we can\u2019t leave our railways exposed,\u201d he replied. Grayling\u2019s letter incensed union leaders. Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, said Grayling was \u201cbeing less than honest on all counts\u201d and accused him of selectively quoting \u201ca private meeting I had with him, held in good faith under Chatham House rules\u201d. An Aslef spokesman said: \u201cThe secretary of state is being incredibly disingenuous, as nothing had been arranged, so there was nothing to which we could turn up.\u201d In a video message posted on Twitter, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said passengers had been abandoned by the government. Addressing commuters, Khan said: \u201cYou pay too much for delays, cancellations and disruption. You deserve a better service. Southern commuters have been abandoned by the government. You\u2019ve had months of chaos. But it doesn\u2019t have to be like this.\u201d The mayor urged commuters to write to Grayling and Theresa May to ask Transport for London to take control of the service, saying it would offer more frequent and more reliable trains with fewer strikes and more affordable fares. \u201cThis is far more important than party politics. Together we can secure the decent and affordable commute that you deserve,\u201d he said. Grayling dismissed the suggestion as \u201cnonsense\u201d. Commuters were already feeling the impact on Tuesday morning. At Balham station in south London, Joseph Volcy, 32, said he was not sure he would get to work at a digital marketing company. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know [about the strike] and it\u2019s awful. By the way I\u2019m seeing it, I won\u2019t get to work until 11am, because it\u2019s in Kingston,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time. I\u2019m really disappointed. The train is never on time, sometimes it says it\u2019s coming and just disappears. I\u2019m thinking I have to move house. It\u2019s bad because it really affects your morale.\u201d Jessica Knight, 23, was on her way to work at a Savills estate agents in Richmond. \u201cIt\u2019s a pain in the arse,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to work from home. My boss won\u2019t be happy. I didn\u2019t realise it was completely not working. It\u2019s really annoying because there\u2019s so many people trying to get to work and do their jobs. They need to sort it out really.\u201d Asked if she had any sympathy for those taking strike action, she replied: \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d The RMT\u2019s Steve Hedley said the strike was about removing the \u201csafety critical\u201d role of guards on trains. Speaking at London Bridge on Tuesday he said he hoped the government would allow Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), to negotiate in good faith. \u201cAs you can see there is a total shutdown today of the entire network,\u201d he said. On Monday, appeal court judges upheld last week\u2019s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by GTR that industrial action called by the train drivers\u2019 union infringed rights under European law. GTR had already urged passengers not to travel, irrespective of the court\u2019s decision, warning that it would not be able to run a service. Drivers will also strike on Wednesday and Friday this week and plan six consecutive days of strikes in January. A continuing overtime ban on the short-staffed train service is further affecting services on non-strike days. Charles Horton, GTR\u2019s chief executive, said the company was disappointed by the court of appeal\u2019s ruling. He said: \u201cWe will now be asking Acas [the mediation service] to convene urgent and immediate talks between GTR and Aslef; talks that we hoped to get moving over the weekend, but Aslef would not agree. Our aim is to find a resolution to their dispute so we can bring an end to the misery being suffered by the travelling public.\u201d Whelan said the strike had been forced by an intransigent management. \u201cIndustrial action is always the last resort. Even now, all we want is for the company to sit down with us and negotiate \u2013 properly, sensibly and in good faith, not to simply restate their old entrenched position \u2013 and do a deal for the benefit of passengers, staff and, of course, the company.\u201d The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the industrial action was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. Tory MP Nick Herbert, who represents many Southern passengers as MP for Arundel and South Downs, backed measures to end strikes on the rail network. Speaking to BBC News he said: \u201cWe should look at what more can be done to prevent essential public services being disrupted in this way. It is deeply unfair on the travelling public and something really has got to be done about it.\u201d Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said it was an insult to passengers to blame Southern\u2019s failures on trade unions rather than the incompetence of management and government ministers. \u201cAs commuters are well aware, Southern\u2019s substandard service predates any industrial action, and trains are cancelled, late and dangerously overcrowded every day regardless of strike action,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that ministers are defending this failed franchise as a point of political pride when they should be sticking up for taxpayers and commuters.\u201d Commuters were planning a protest march on Thursday from Southern\u2019s main London hub, Victoria, to the Department for Transport. The Association of British Commuters set out its demands ahead of the protest, calling for urgent and transparent intervention into the industrial dispute, a fully independent public inquiry into Southern rail, and transparency from the government in the form of answers to crowdsourced questions. If these can\u2019t be met it is calling on Grayling to resign. \u201cWe demand that the secretary of state for transport not only intervenes but does so openly and transparently,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cOur message to the government is this: we are not only commuters, we are citizens for whom his department is responsible and we have urgent questions that need answering.\u201d",

They need to sort it out really.\u201d</p> <p> Asked if she had any sympathy for those taking strike action, she replied: \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d</p> <p>The RMT\u2019s Steve Hedley said the strike was about removing the \u201csafety critical\u201d role of guards on trains.</p> <p>Speaking at London Bridge on Tuesday he said he hoped the government would allow Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), to negotiate in good faith. \u201cAs you can see there is a total shutdown today of the entire network,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Monday, appeal court judges upheld last week\u2019s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by GTR that industrial action called by the train drivers\u2019 union infringed rights under European law.</p> <p>GTR had already urged passengers not to travel, irrespective of the court\u2019s decision, warning that it would not be able to run a service. Drivers will also strike on Wednesday and Friday this week and plan six consecutive days of strikes in January. A continuing overtime ban on the short-staffed train service is further affecting services on non-strike days.</p> <p>Charles Horton, GTR\u2019s chief executive, said the company was disappointed by the court of appeal\u2019s ruling. He said: \u201cWe will now be asking Acas [the mediation service] to convene urgent and immediate talks between GTR and Aslef; talks that we hoped to get moving over the weekend, but Aslef would not agree. Our aim is to find a resolution to their dispute so we can bring an end to the misery being suffered by the travelling public.\u201d</p> <p>Whelan said the strike had been forced by an intransigent management. \u201cIndustrial action is always the last resort. Even now, all we want is for the company to sit down with us and negotiate \u2013 properly, sensibly and in good faith, not to simply restate their old entrenched position \u2013 and do a deal for the benefit of passengers, staff and, of course, the company.\u201d</p> <p>The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the industrial action was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d.<br></p> <p>Tory MP Nick Herbert, who represents many Southern passengers as MP for Arundel and South Downs, backed measures to end strikes on the rail network.</p> <p>Speaking to BBC News he said: \u201cWe should look at what more can be done to prevent essential public services being disrupted in this way. It is deeply unfair on the travelling public and something really has got to be done about it.\u201d</p> <p>Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said it was an insult to passengers to blame Southern\u2019s failures on trade unions rather than the incompetence of management and government ministers. <br></p> <p>\u201cAs commuters are well aware, Southern\u2019s substandard service predates any industrial action, and trains are cancelled, late and dangerously overcrowded every day regardless of strike action,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is that ministers are defending this failed franchise as a point of political pride when they should be sticking up for taxpayers and commuters.\u201d</p> <p>Commuters were planning a protest march on Thursday from Southern\u2019s main London hub, Victoria, to the Department for Transport.</p> <p>The Association of British Commuters set out its demands ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/389769161362944/\">protest</a>, calling for urgent and transparent intervention into the industrial dispute, a fully independent public inquiry into Southern rail, and transparency from the government in the form of answers to crowdsourced questions. If these can\u2019t be met it is calling on Grayling to resign.</p> <p>\u201cWe demand that the secretary of state for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/transport\">transport</a> not only intervenes but does so openly and transparently,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cOur message to the government is this: we are not only commuters, we are citizens for whom his department is responsible and we have urgent questions that need answering.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The British government has cut its stake in Lloyds Banking Group to below 7%, raising the amount recovered to more than \u00a317.5bn of the \u00a320.3bn of taxpayers\u2019 money used to bail out the bank during the financial crisis. The sale of a further 1% of Lloyds shares on Tuesday reduced the government\u2019s stake to 6.93%, from a peak of 43%. Simon Kirby, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said: \u201cSelling our shares in Lloyds Banking Group and making sure that we get back all the cash taxpayers injected into it during the financial crisis is a key government priority. So I am pleased that we have continued to reduce our stake in Lloyds.\u201d The chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced in October that he was abandoning his predecessor\u2019s plans to sell the remainder of the Lloyds stake to members of the public at a discounted rate. Since then, the Treasury has been selling its remaining shares on the stock market, reducing its stake in stages from 9.2% to 6.9%. The aim is to have sold all its shares within a year, with the proceeds being used to reduce national debt. The current sales are taking place at a price lower than the 73.6p average price paid for the stake during the crisis, but Hammond has said he expects to recoup the full amount injected into the bank. Lloyds shares are trading at just above 61p. A spokesperson for Lloyds said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement shows the further progress made in returning Lloyds Banking Group to full private ownership and enabling the taxpayer to get their money back. \u201cThis reflects the hard work undertaken over the last five years to transform the group into a simple, low-risk and customer-focused bank that is committed to helping Britain prosper.\u201d While the government is selling off its stake in Lloyds, it retains a 73% stake in Royal Bank of Scotland which it also bailed out during the financial crisis. Hammond said in October that the time was not right to sell its stake in the Edinburgh-based bank, in which a 5% stake was sold in August 2015 at a \u00a31bn loss.",

      "bodyText": "Her name, according to the cheap cardboard label, is \u201cShu Yi baby\u201d, but the large plastic doll in a lurid green outfit will not be welcomed into any UK households as a gift on Christmas Day. After being impounded at Felixstowe by trading standards officials, the imported toy has been declared unsafe after undergoing tests and will be destroyed. In a draughty warehouse on the edge ofthe UK\u2019s busiest port \u2013 and commercial gateway for the Far East \u2013 officers are stepping up their fight against dangerous goods that flood the Christmas gift market. They are focusing on what they consider high risk products such as toys, electrical items, cosmetics and power tools. \u201cThe doll came in a large consignment from the far east and probably cost a few cents, or pence,\u201d declares Phil Reed, an import surveillance officer with the National Trading Standards, tugging at the doll\u2019s clothing and soft moulded plastic feet. Tests on the dolls were carried out last month after the container that delivered them was impounded. Reed has now received the test results and they are alarming. They reveal that the toy\u2019s feet contain harmful levels of chemicals that can cause long-term health problems. The use of phthalates, which can disrupt children\u2019s hormones, is tightly restricted across Europe where toy manufacturers must restrict content to very low levels. But the laboratory tests show that the levels in this toy \u2013 destined for pre-Christmas markets and car boot sales \u2013 breach regulations. In addition, the doll has a bogus CE mark that suggests \u2013 falsely \u2013 that she meets recognised EU safety standards. \u201cThis is purporting to be a stamp of approval and appears to be a deliberate attempt to mislead consumers,\u201d says Reed. Also tested from the same consignment were \u201cplush\u201d dolls, made from a furry synthetic fabric, where weak zips and easy access to battery compartments failed the safety assessment and were deemed to be dangerous choking hazards for young children. Reed is surrounded by piles of bulging cardboard boxes on pallets in Shed 70 - a warehouse the size of a football pitch, where the selected contents of some containers coming into Felixstowe are inspected. More than 40% of all imported goods coming into the UK do so via Felixstowe, where it typically takes three days to unload the up to 19,224 containers on the world\u2019s biggest capacity cargo ship, the 395m MSC Oscar. A staggering 4m full containers come through the port every year, and Reed \u2013 part of the NTS\u2019s ports and borders team and working as part of Suffolk Trading Standards\u2019 own team \u2013 is responsible for organising and carrying out regular inspections. \u201c It would be difficult for any agency to examine anything but a very small proportion of the containers arriving at the port each year,\u201d says Reed. \u201cTherefore we base our examinations on those which we consider to pose the greatest safety risk to consumers. Or we might be focusing our attention on those importers or traders who have a history of importing non-compliant and unsafe products.\u201d At one end of the warehouse are stacks of boxes \u2013 plastered with yellow warning labels \u2013 whose contents have already been impounded by trading standards. At the opposite end sit the contents of one container that has been emptied completely awaiting inspection. This container was singled out because the far east-based company that despatched the goods had no UK or EU base while a UK residential address had been used for VAT registration. Reed opened some boxes and found electrical products that are proving popular in the run-up to the Christmas including hair straightening brushes, steam facial cleansers and portable chargers. He is constantly on the lookout for products with faulty plugs and chargers that can overheat and cause fires. The volume of imported drones suggests that they will be popular as Christmas toys, Reed says, recalling a hectic period this time last year as officials seized thousands of unsafe hoverboards. \u201cOne particular trend we have spotted is the growth in \u201cmicro-importers\u201d \u2013 consumers in the UK who order half or even a whole container of goods to import for onward sale,\u201d adds Reed. \u201cThey have no idea what they are buying and are not interested in finding out. This can lead to fake, and often dangerous, products such as hoverboards ending up in people\u2019s homes.\u201d Cosmetics are also increasingly a problem where they contain a higher proportion of restricted chemicals than is allowed by law. A black henna hair dye popular with ethnic communities has in some cases been found to have more than 2% of the chemical PPD, which can cause burning of the scalp and skin. In September the trading standards team intercepted four separate consignments of nail manicure lamps and nail decoration kits from China because they were unsafe. They were found to have hazards including lack of proper insulation and unsafe plugs and fuses. Consumers were warned that some of these kits may have found their way onto shopping websites like Amazon and eBay. However, the consignment of Shu Yi baby dolls will not get underneath the Christmas tree.

      "bodyText": "A strike by train drivers has brought Southern services to a halt after the court of appeal rejected a second attempt by the rail company to block the action. Judges upheld last week\u2019s ruling by the high court to dismiss claims by Southern\u2019s owner, Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), that industrial action called by the train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, infringed rights under European law. GTR had already urged passengers not to travel on Tuesday, irrespective of the court\u2019s decision, warning that it would not be able to run a service. Drivers will also strike on Wednesday and Friday this week, and plan six consecutive days of strikes in January. An ongoing overtime ban on the short-staffed train service is further affecting services, even on non-strike days. Charles Horton, GTR\u2019s chief executive, said the company was disappointed by the court of appeal\u2019s ruling: \u201cRegrettably, there will be no train services for passengers tomorrow, Wednesday and Friday. We strongly advise people not to travel. \u201cWe will now be asking Acas to convene urgent and immediate talks between GTR and Aslef; talks that we hoped to get moving over the weekend, but Aslef would not agree. Our aim is to find a resolution to their dispute so we can bring an end to the misery being suffered by the travelling public.\u201d But Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, said the strike had been forced by an intransigent management. \u201cIndustrial action is always the last resort. Even now, all we want is for the company to sit down with us and negotiate \u2013 properly, sensibly and in good faith, not to simply restate their old entrenched position \u2013 and do a deal for the benefit of passengers, staff and, of course, the company.\u201d The court ruling came as Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, stepped up his attack on the rail unions, claiming that they were demanding \u201cnot just to stop the current modernisation process, but to start reversing 30 years of working practice changes right across the country\u201d. Grayling wrote to MPs on Monday to reiterate his belief that the strikes were politically motivated, saying he did not want to further politicise the dispute by taking part in negotiations. He wrote: \u201cWhen I met the general secretary of Aslef soon after my appointment, with virtually his first breath he promised me \u201810 years of industrial action\u2019. I have therefore believed it better to avoid direct ministerial involvement in negotiations during the autumn, as my involvement would make the issue even more political than it is.\u201d Whelan, however, said that Grayling was \u201cbeing less than honest on all counts\u201d and accused him of selectively quoting \u201ca private meeting I had with him held, in good faith, under Chatham House rules\u201d. Grayling\u2019s letter also claimed that \u201cAslef didn\u2019t turn up\u201d to talks with Southern and had refused a further offer of talks without preconditions on Monday, adding that these were \u201cnot the actions of a union that wants to act to get services back to normal\u201d. An Aslef spokesman said: \u201cThe secretary of state is being incredibly disingenuous, as nothing had been arranged, so there was nothing to which we could turn up.\u201d The home secretary, Amber Rudd, added to criticism of unions, branding the action \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said it was an insult to passengers to blame Southern\u2019s failures on trade unions rather than the incompetence of management and government ministers. He said: \u201cAs commuters are well aware, Southern\u2019s sub-standard service predates any industrial action and trains are cancelled, late and dangerously overcrowded every day regardless of strike action. \u201cThe truth is that ministers are defending this failed franchise as a point of political pride when they should be sticking up for taxpayers and commuters.\u201d Commuters are planning a protest march on Thursday from Southern\u2019s main London hub, Victoria station, to the Department of Transport. The Association of British Commuters is demanding an immediate government intervention in the dispute and a public inquiry into the collapse of Southern rail services. It also called on Grayling to act or resign.",

      "bodyText": "Given how interest rates dominate the economic debate in Australia, last week\u2019s GDP figures were one of the rare cases of major economic news having next to no impact on interest rates. And yet perhaps the Reserve Bank of Australia should react, given the national accounts point to a weakening in the housing market in all states except New South Wales. One reason the latest GDP figures won\u2019t affect interest rates is timing. Last Tuesday, the RBA board met and decided to keep the cash rate on hold at its record low of 1.5%. The next day the GDP figures for the September quarter were released showing in seasonally adjusted terms the economy had gone backwards. The RBA board does not meet in January, so the next time they meet will be 7 February, at which point the September GDP numbers will be referring to a period some four months previous. The December quarter GDP figures will also be only three weeks away from being released. But while the likelihood is the RBA board will wait at least until March before acting, the September figures would certainly have piqued its interest, especially given they almost certainly render the RBA\u2019s growth projection as too optimistic. In its latest statement on monetary policy the RBA estimated GDP growth in 2016 would be with 2.5% to 3.5%. But to achieve even 2.5% annual growth, the December quarter would need to grow by around 1.3% \u2013 the biggest quarterly growth for nearly a decade. And one contributor to the September quarter fall in GDP was a decline in the construction of private dwellings. While much of the blame was placed on the weather, and the erratic nature of the quarterly seasonally adjusted measure, the impact such dwelling construction is having on annual GDP growth looks to have peaked: Now that peak would be fine, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be much else replacing it \u2013 especially as the growth in household consumption is also falling. But the problem for the RBA remains that its tool of cutting interest rates is very imprecise. It is now five years since the RBA began cutting rates in November 2011. In that time there has been a veritable surge in the housing investment that has helped fuel economic growth. But that boom has been very much on the east coast, and especially Sydney-centric. Last week\u2019s GDP figures showed that in the past five years private dwelling investment in NSW has grown by 60% compared to just 12% in the rest of the nation: While the ACT has had a very strong surge in construction in the past year, NSW in the past five years has for the most part outpaced everywhere else. So strong has been the growth of dwelling investment in NSW that while in total NSW accounts for just under a third of all such investment in Australia, it has accounted for 61% of the growth in that investment in the past five years: And while the past five years has seen dwelling investment in NSW outpace the rest of the nation, it has for the most part at least been in sync. But over the past 12 months, NSW has split with the rest of the nation: The difficulty for the RBA however is that in the September quarter, when Australia\u2019s economy went backwards, it was cutting interest rates \u2013 first in May, which preceded the quarter and then again in August. And yet as the latest housing finance data released late last week shows, the number people borrowing to buy a home is going backwards: The number of owner occupiers taking out housing loans has now been going backwards for 12 months. But what has taken over is investor finance. After a three year massive surge of investor driven housing finance, new rules to limit such loans saw a sharp drop from the middle of last year. But since the start of this year, investors are back and borrowing at such a rate that they may soon again overtake owner-occupiers: But it was the surge of investors entering the housing market that led to the boom in house prices \u2013 something the RBA would not wish to see repeated, and it would halt it seeking to cut rates again for fear of sparking another price boom. Here however the RBA is currently being helped by the banks themselves. Due to some rise in funding costs and a need to adhere to the rules on limiting investor lending, banks have begun to raise the rates for investor housing loans independently of the RBA. This might actually give the RBA room to cut rates further if it believes the lower rates will predominantly go to owner-occupiers. But the issue for the RBA will remain \u2013 can it justify cutting rates to assist Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia, and parts of Queensland, when the biggest housing market in the land in Sydney is already going gangbusters?",

Due to some rise in funding costs and a need to adhere to the rules on limiting investor lending, banks have begun to raise the rates for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/05/nab-and-westpac-increase-rates-on-investor-home-loans\">investor housing loans</a> independently of the RBA. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jul/21/housing-affordability-inequality-and-our-flatlining-household-incomes\">Housing affordability, inequality, and our flatlining household incomes | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This might actually give the RBA room to cut rates further if it believes the lower rates will predominantly go to owner-occupiers. </p> <p>But the issue for the RBA will remain \u2013 can it justify cutting rates to assist Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia, and parts of Queensland, when the biggest housing market in the land in Sydney is already going gangbusters? </p>",
