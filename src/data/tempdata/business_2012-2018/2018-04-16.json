      "bodyText": "Next month, should the Reserve Bank once again keeps interest rates on hold (rated a 100% chance in the market) it will mark 91 months \u2013 more than seven and a half years \u2013 since the RBA last raised the cash rate (in November 2010) from 4.5% to 4.75%. And despite warnings from the RBA governor that the next change in interest rates will likely be a rise, the latest housing finance figures suggest this current period without a rise is set to continue. We are now experiencing the longest run without a rate rise in the RBA\u2019s history \u2013 well beyond the 58 months during the mid to late 1990s when the RBA took the cash rate from 7.5% to 4.75%: The current period is also the longest the RBA has sat on its hands. In May it will be 21 months in a row of the cash rate being steady at 1.5%. Since 1990, the RBA has changed the cash rate on average just under once every five months. So we are in not only an unprecedented period without a rate rise, but also one without any movement at all. But if we look further back to beyond the period when the RBA was independent and set the cash rate, to changes in the standard variable home loan rate, we see that since the 1960s there have been more periods where rates are falling than where they are rising. Generally, we have long period of rates going down, interspersed with short-sharp periods of rate rising. In this context, the period in the early 2000s up to the financial crisis hit was an abnormally long period of rates rising: Given this period began soon after John Howard promised to keep interest rates at record lows, it suggests hubris in politics will tend to come back to bite you. But it also shows that given interest rates rises are generally associated with strong economic growth and rising inflation, and rate falls are associated with weaker growth, the mining boom period was clearly an aberration in our economic history. By and large monetary policy is mostly geared towards helping economic growth improve, rather than hindering. It also shows that given the short period rate rises, generally it doesn\u2019t take many rate rises to hit the economic breaks, whereas it is much harder for interest rates cuts to both start and keep the economy going. Last week, the governor of the Reserve Bank caused a bit of a kerfuffle when he told an audience in Perth that \u201cit is more likely that the next move in the cash rate will be up, not down, reflecting the improvement in the economy\u201d. He also noted that since last increase in the cash rate was more than seven years ago, it would be \u201ca shock to some people\u201d. Indeed. Had you taken out a 30-year loan in November 2010, you would now be a quarter of the way into it without having had to worry about the Reserve Bank lifting rates. The good news is the \u201cshock\u201d is still a way off yet. Lowe was quick to note that \u201cit is worth remembering that the most likely scenario in which interest rates are increasing is one in which the economy is strengthening and income growth is also picking up\u201d. And we\u2019re not there yet. Yes, employment has been good, but incomes not so much. As it is, the market barely reacted to his statements, given he was mostly just saying what everyone already knew. For most of this year the market has been pushing out the time it next expects the cash rate to rise. In January, it was predicting one by the end of this year, now it suggests the middle of next year is more likely: One reason is that there is little sense that inflation is about to take off in any serious way. The inflation expectations of union officials and market economists are up from where they were in the middle of 2016, but have not been rising for nearly a year: And similarly the housing market is not showing any signs of needing to be cooled. Reports are that across the nation, but especially in Sydney, auction clearance rates have been falling \u2013 less than two-thirds of Sydney auction listings sold last weekend, well down on the more than 80% that were clearing a year ago. This again should be no real shock. The growth of housing finance has been very weak for around a year now. The latest housing finance figures released last week by the Australian Bureau of Statistics saw finance stay flat in February. Yes, in seasonally adjusted terms there was a 1% increase, but that can be very noisy: The trend growth figures show both owner-occupier and investor finance displaying little signs of life: And the annual growth figures show that we have now had two months in a row where the value of housing finance is below what it was 12 months earlier: Certainly such figures would make it very odd for the RBA to think interest rates need to rise. Why seek to cut growth that might be visible in employment numbers, but not in wages or prices? So for now the long period of doing nothing looks set to continue, and unless the latest inflation figures out next week surprise us, the only shock for a rate rise would be if it were happen sooner rather than later.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s abrupt resignation from WPP triggered a 6.5% slide in the group\u2019s share price on Monday as investors mulled the uncertain future of the world\u2019s largest advertising business. Sir Martin, who founded WPP 33 years ago, resigned with immediate effect on Saturday amid an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct. Analysts reacted cautiously to the resignation, telling investors there will not be an immediate crisis at WPP. However, they acknowledged that the market had reacted to uncertainty over succession planning at WPP, compounding a performance that has resulted in shares in the group declining by a third over the past year. One of WPP\u2019s largest shareholders, Harris Associates, said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d to have a leadership transition without Sorrell\u2019s involvement. \u201cIt highlights the apparent lack of detailed succession planning that has troubled us and many other observers for some time,\u201d Roddy Davidson, an analyst at investment group Shore Capital, said. \u201cWe are not overly concerned about the immediate impact of Sorrell\u2019s departure on the group\u2019s flagship agencies as these are major international enterprises in their own right, with strong performance track records and independent management structures. That said, the resultant vacuum at the top of the company is not ideal.\u201d WPP\u2019s share price ended the day down 6.5% at \u00a311.11p \u2013 adding pressure on the already embattled ad group. The next test for WPP comes on 30 April when the company reports its first quarter results, with a failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations likely to increase the pressure for a break-up or disposals. Sorrell, 73, has \u201cunreservedly denied\u201d the misconduct allegations and WPP\u2019s board has said it will not be publishing the outcome of the investigations into them by an independent law firm. The decision not to publish was criticised by the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, who said there was a \u201creal lack of transparency\u201d and \u201cany investigations done by the company should be made public\u201d. The company said it had concluded the investigation and had no further comment to make. After years of above-par performances WPP put out two growth warnings last year \u2013 before reporting its worst financial year since the 2009 ad recession \u2013 as clients pulled budgets and investors started to question the future of the global holding company model in the increasingly digital age. \u201cWhether WPP should survive in its current form is a more challenging question,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cParticularly as an increasingly complex and dynamic media landscape, and growing competition from more focused players will, in our view, require a degree of flexibility and agility that large holding companies could struggle to deliver.\u201d A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders to succeed Sorrell, including the chief executive of publishing and exhibitions group Informa, Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, the cable firm NTL and at WPP\u2019s ad agency JWT; Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi; the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch, and Andrew Robertson, chief executive of WPP rival Omnicom\u2019s global BBDO ad network. The frontrunning internal candidates are Mark Read, the chief executive of Wunderman and WPP Digital, and Andrew Scott, a top executive at WPP\u2019s European operation, who were appointed WPP\u2019s joint chief operating officers following Sorrell\u2019s departure on Saturday. \u201cWe believe Sir Martin will be hard to replace with one person,\u201d Paul Richards, analyst at Numis, said. \u201cThe succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP. Our base case is for a new management team to continue and refine the existing strategy, though we acknowledge that any group without a chief executive is vulnerable to a bid approach in the interregnum.\u201d Alex DeGroote, analyst at Cenkos Securities, puts the break-up value of WPP\u2019s parts at about \u00a317 a share, valuing the group at \u00a322bn. WPP\u2019s current share price is \u00a311.50, a market capitalisation of \u00a315bn.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Martin Sorrell\u2019s resignation has raised the question of whether his successor will be able to stop a breakup of the world\u2019s largest advertising group. A number of names have emerged as potential runners and riders, including the Informa chief executive Stephen Carter, who has worked at Ofcom, cable firm NTL and at WPP\u2019s ad agency JWT; Adam Crozier, whose pedigree includes running ITV, Royal Mail, the Football Association and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi; the Sky chief executive, Jeremy Darroch; and Andrew Robertson, the chief executive of WPP rival Omnicom\u2019s global BBDO ad network. Some analysts believe that there is more value in breaking up the sprawling empire \u2013 WPP employs more than 200,000 staff in 400 separate ad businesses in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries \u2013 particularly as its stock market value has plummeted more than a third in the past year. A breakup of WPP could net shareholders more than \u00a322bn, about \u00a317 a share, much more than its current value of \u00a311.50 a share or \u00a315bn market cap, according to analysts. WPP reports its operations in four main business groupings: 1. Advertising and media buying (estimated sale value: \u00a311bn-plus) The largest is advertising and media investment management \u2013 essentially the agencies that make ads and those that buy the ad space they appear in \u2013 which is the jewel in Sorrell\u2019s crown. AMIM made \u00a31.1bn in profit last year (almost 50% of WPP\u2019s total of \u00a32.3bn), accounts for 46% of revenues and boasts the best margin of 19%. Global advertising networks J Walter Thompson: The world\u2019s oldest advertising agency group with clients including Shell, Debenhams and Kit Kat. Ogilvy &amp; Mather: Clients include Unilever\u2019s Dove, as well as Boots. Young &amp; Rubicam: Its most noticeable campaigns of recent times have included Virgin and the BBC. Grey Global: Clients include Marks &amp; Spencer, Lucozade and Birds Eye. Global media agency networks MediaCom: Employs almost 6,000 staff globally with clients including Sky, Gillette and Mars. Mindshare: Has clients including HSBC and Marmite owner Unilever. It is in charge of allocating $35bn (\u00a324.4bn) worth of advertising spend a year. Wavemaker: Formed from the recent merger of MEC and Maxus, employs 8,500 staff with clients including L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Vodafone, Compare the Market and Morrisons. Essence: Clients include BT, Google, Financial Times, Target and Visa. 2. Public relations and public affairs (estimated sale value: \u00a31.4bn) The least profitable of WPP\u2019s units, accounting for just 8% (\u00a3183m) of the total operating profit and 7.7% of revenues. Companies within this division include Cohn &amp; Wolfe and Burson Marsteller (which are merging globally), Hill &amp; Knowlton, Finsbury, Buchanan, Clarion and Ogilvy PR. 3. Market research (estimated sale value: \u00a33.5bn) The second-smallest profit centre for WPP, which officially calls this division data investment management, contributes 15% of total profits (\u00a3350m) and 18.5% of revenues for the group. WPP is already mulling a potential sale of the division. 4. Branding, healthcare and specialist (estimated sale value: \u00a38bn to \u00a310bn) The division has some attractive assets due to the profitability of areas such as healthcare. It is also home to a number of WPP\u2019s valuable digital and interactive businesses. It accounts for 27.5% of profits (\u00a3625m) and 28% of total revenues. Digital advertising businesses include Wunderman, VML and AKQA, which has clients including Nike and Volvo. Branding agencies include Fitch and Coley Porter Bell. Healthcare communications agencies include GCI, Sudler &amp; Hennessey and Common Health. Clients include AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Colgate, GlaxoSmithKline and Kimberley Clark. Other investments (estimated sale value: \u00a36bn) WPP also has what anlaysts have called a \u201chidden treasure trove\u201d of assets that are not part of its core business lines but could be worth as much as \u00a36bn. These include stakes in the Vice media group and Nasdaq-listed software group Globant. WPP lists these investments, which also include tech and digital businesses, on its books at a value of \u00a32.2bn. However, analysts point out that the true market value could be three times higher, at more than \u00a36bn.",

Dow Jones up 0.5% S&amp;P 500 up 0.5% Nasdaq up 0.66% However, European stock markets have slipped after starting the day in positive territory. The FTSE 100 index in London has fallen more, dragged down again by the stronger pound. Sterling is trading 0.57% higher at $1.4323, the highest since 25 January, and the second-highest level since the Brexit vote. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.8% Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.15% France\u2019s CAC down 0.09% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.05% Spain\u2019s Ibex down 0.03% Oil prices are falling today. Brent crude in London has lost 1.3% to $71.64 a barrel while US crude is down 1.4% at $66.43 a barrel. With this, we are closing the blog. Thank you for reading and for your great comments. We will be back tomorrow. Since Trump became president in January 2017, the dollar has weakened substantially against most major currencies, including China\u2019s yuan and, until the US sanctions against Russia in the last few weeks, the rouble. Against the yuan, the dollar has fallen 8.6% since 20 January 2017, Reuters data show. It has risen 4.5% against the rouble, although it was down 4% against the Russian currency until new US sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs were announced 1 1/2 weeks ago. The US dollar index which measures its value against a basket of major trading partner currencies has lost 11.2% since Trump took office. Back to currencies. US president Donald Trump has tweeted In Greece, the central government ran up a primary budget surplus of \u20ac2.3bn in the first three months of the year, beating its target, Reuters reports. According to finance ministry data, the surplus was boosted by higher tax revenues. The government was targeting a primary budget surplus, which excludes debt servicing costs, of \u20ac1.09bn. The central government surplus excludes the budgets of social security organisations and local administration. It is not the measure monitored by Greece\u2019s EU and IMF lenders but is a good health indicator of the country\u2019s finances. While the pound is still up nearly half a percent against the dollar, Russia\u2019s rouble has stabilised following a steep drop earlier in the day. The dollar now buys 62.33 units of the Russian currency, compared with 63.15 in early London trading. Last week, the rouble weakened beyond 65 against the dollar for the first time since late 2016 after new US sanctions against a number of Russian oligarchs and officials. More sanctions are looming today, in retaliation for Russia\u2019s support for the Syrian regime which is thought to be bhind the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta two weeks ago. Over in the US, retail sales bounced back in March after three months of falling sales, with households buying cars and other big-ticket items. The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.6% last month from the previous month, following declines of 0.1% and 0.2% in February and January respectively. Sales were up 4.5% from a year earlier. Excluding cars, petrol, building materials and food services, which can be volatile, retail sales rose 0.4% compared with an unchanged reading in February. Economists have blamed the weakness in consumer spending at the start of the year on delays in processing tax refunds, which have held back households\u2019 spending power. Bookmaker Betway has suspended betting on the next governor of the Bank of England after a flurry of bets on Andrew Bailey. The next governor, who will succeed Mark Carney in June 2019, is expected to be announced towards the end of the year. Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority had been relatively unfancied at 9/1, but the online bookie received a sudden influx of bets on him succeeding Carney and has suspended betting as a result. Bailey had been tipped by City economists as the most likely candidate to succeed Carney. Betway\u2019s Alan Alger said: There had been some speculation that Andrew Bailey was a leading candidate to replace Mark Carney as the new Governor of the Bank of England and in the last few days we\u2019ve seen huge support for him taking the role. The current Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority was available at 9/1, but as a result of the weight of support towards him, we\u2019ve had no choice but to suspend the market. China\u2019s president Xi Jinping has said rising protectionism adds risks and uncertainty to the world economy, according to state media. His comments were made to Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. Xi also said it was necessary for both sides to strengthen cooperation and work together to find new driving forces for global economic growth. Sterling has climbed above $1.43 for the first time since 25 January, and only the second time since the Brexit vote in June 2016. The pound climbed as high as $1.4318, up 0.54%, as technical meetings between UK and EU negotiators got under way in Brussels, followed by talks over the Irish border issue on Wednesday. Brian Martin, head of global economics at ANZ, said there is \u201cstrong vested interest on both sides to agree on a workable trade deal\u201d. However, Jane Foley, senior currencies strategist at Rabobank, cautioned that hopes that a trade deal can be hammered out by October 2018 may be too ambitious, with the north Ireland border remaining a particular area of concern. Markets also have their eyes on key UK labour market, inflation and retail sales data in coming days. The Bank of England is widely expected to raise interest rates next month but if there are further signs of an economic slowdown, a \u201cdovish\u201d rate hike would put pressure on sterling, analysts say. Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management at consultancy Opimas, has sent us his thoughts on Bank of America\u2019s first-quarter results. We are seeing a very favorable environment for banking currently and Bank of America\u2019s earnings reflect this. Overall, BofA\u2019s results are good, and pushed RoE [return on equity] above 10%, even if they are not as strong as arch-rival JPMorgan\u2019s. Consumer Banking and Wealth Management registered solid, sustainable growth in revenues. However, investment banking fees pulled Global Banking into slightly negative territory. BofA\u2019s results in fixed-income trading were not as strong as we expected and declined compared to Q1 last year, but handily beat the last quarter of 2017. EU foreign ministers have threatened to impose new economic sanctions on Syria over the recent chemical attack on civilians in Ghouta near Damascus, but held off from joining anticipated new US sanctions against Russia. The 28 foreign ministers said in a joint statement after talks in Luxembourg: The European Union will continue to consider further restrictive measures against Syria as long as the repression continues. In the US, the bank earnings season continues. Bank of America has reported a 34% rise in first-quarter profit after the lender benefited from higher interest rates. The second-biggest US bank by assets said net income rose to a record $6.5bn in the three months to March from $4.5bn a year earlier. Earnings per share climbed to 62 cents from 45 cents. Wall Street analysts had expected 59 cents per share. Total revenues rose 4% to $23.3bn. Consumer banking, Bank of America\u2019s biggest business, posted 9% growth in revenues to $9bn. It relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximise profits because it has a large amount of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities. Chief executive Brian Moynihan said: Strong client activity, coupled with a growing global economy and solid US consumer activity, led to record quarterly earnings. America\u2019s biggest bank JPMorgan Chase and Citi also reported strong earnings on Friday. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has looked at the Footsie. The FTSE was dealing with duel pressures this Monday, both in its commodity sector losses and the success of sterling. While the rest of the markets held strong, the FTSE dropped 35 points to send it towards a one week low. Part of that decline is being informed by the chunky drop suffered by BP and Shell, which slipped 1.5% and 0.8% respectively. That\u2019s because Brent Crude itself fell 1.2%, the black stuff in retreat in response following the contrast between the actually military engagement seen in Syria over the weekend and the supply-worrying rhetoric used by Trump last week. But that\u2019s not the only thing upsetting the FTSE \u2013 the index also had to deal with the pound\u2019s latest increase. Against the dollar sterling shot up half a percent, sending cable above $1.43 to its highest price in almost a year and a half. The currency was less robust against the euro, and even then it lifted it towards a fresh 11 month peak. Turning to this afternoon and the US open may inject a bit more positivity into a fairly stagnant session. The Dow Jones is expected to surge 150 points after the bell, a move that would lift the index back above 24500. As for data, the focus will be on retail sales, with analysts expecting a rise from -0.1% to 0.4% month-on-month. Stock markets have got off to a (cautiously) positive start to the week despite air strikes carried out by the US, UK and France in Syria over the weekend, in response to a chemical weapons attack a couple of weeks ago. The missile strikes had been well-flagged and Russia did not retaliate. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.41% at 7234.83 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.18% at 12,465.78 France\u2019s CAC flat at 5315.57 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.22% at 23,382.52 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.16% at 9782.50 Oil prices are falling. Brent crude in London has lost nearly $1 to $71.63 while US crude is down 86 cents at $66.53 a barrel. Spot gold has steadied at 1,344.38 an ounce, down 0.1%, after hitting an earlier peak of $1,348.69. The dollar continues to weaken, while sterling is strengthening ahead of key economic data this week. Russian stocks are falling ahead of likely new US sanctions. The rouble-dominated RTS index has slipped 0.4% while the rouble-based MOEX index is down 0.6%. The US is due to announce new economic sanctions against Russia today aimed at companies that are believed to be involved in equipment linked to chemical weapons, according to Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations. The EU has already imposed a range of economic sanctions on the Assad regime, cutting off most diplomatic and economic sanctions, but with very limited impact. Russia is Europe\u2019s biggest energy supplier. While the EU imposed sanctions against Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine, it is cautious about new punitive measures. It appears unlikely that the European Union will join the US in imposing new sanctions on Russia or Syria over the chemical weapons attack that prompted the first co-ordinated western air strikes in Syria at the weekend. EU foreign ministers are putting the emphasis on diplomacy at a meeting in Luxembourg. Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok, who met his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Friday, told reporters as he arrived at the meeting today: We have to keep pushing to get a ceasefire and humanitarian aid through the [UN] Security Council and eventually a peace process. The only solution is a peace process through the Security Council. British foreign secretary Boris Johnson told reporters: It is very important to stress [the strikes are] not an attempt to change the tide of the war in Syria or to have a regime change. I\u2019m afraid the Syrian war will go on its horrible, miserable way. But it was the world saying that we\u2019ve had enough of the use of chemical weapons. Sterling has touched an intra-day high of $1.4304 against the dollar, up 0.5%, the highest level since 25 January. Stock market futures are still suggesting a higher open on Wall Street, with the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 seen opening 0.6% while the Nasdaq is expected to rise 0.7%. The EU has called on Russia and Iran to use their influence on the Syrian government to prevent it from using chemical weapons again. The EU said in comments released to a meeting of the global chemical weapons watchdog, seen by Reuters: The EU calls upon all countries, notably Russia and Iran, to use their influence to prevent any further use of chemical weapons, notably by the Syrian regime. And here is our story on Wetherspoon closing all its social media accounts, a move that has been met with scepticism. Matthew Weaver writes: The pub chain\u2019s decision was reportedly in response to the trolling of some MPs, but many commentators suspected it was a publicity stunt by the chairman, Tim Martin. Commercial real estate agency and consultancy Colliers International says 15 major UK retailers or restaurant groups have gone into CVA (company voluntary arrangement) or administration in the past 12 months. Colliers has calculated that around 12,000 jobs have been lost or are on the line. The most recent business failure was Conviviality, the company behind Bargain Booze and Wine Rack. We wonder how many more retailers are going to get into trouble or people lose their jobs before someone decides to tackle the problem properly. John Webb, head of business rates at Colliers, says: These figures are as bad, if not worse than the crash of 2008/9 when 16 companies went into administration- 12 in 2008 and 4 in 2009- and we are only in April now. Data from Visa card released overnight shows a steep fall in consumers on Britain\u2019s high streets in March. The number of people visiting UK shops dropped 6% compared with the same month last year, the biggest fall in shopper numbers since the end of 2010. UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon is shutting all its social media accounts in protest against the mis-use of personal data and the failure to tackle online bullying. Wetherspoon said it was closing Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts for its head office and almost 900 pubs in Britain and Ireland. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook is under huge pressure after it emerged that the personal information of millions of users was gathered by Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump\u2019s election team and the winning Brexit campaign. Zuckerberg has admitted that the data breach included his own Facebook profile. Social media platforms have also been criticised for doing too little to crack down on bullying and hate speech. Wetherspoon\u2019s chairman and founder Tim Martin said: It\u2019s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion. I don\u2019t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers. Martin has also been vocal in his support of Brexit. Last year Wetherspoon was forced to issue a denial after a spoof Twitter account falsely claimed the company did not allow staff to wear poppies at work to commemorate fallen service men and women. Sterling has fared better than the dollar. The pound is up 0.28% to $1.4276, continuing a two-week rally against the dollar that saw it push towards a new post-Brexit referendum high on Friday. Against the euro, sterling has slipped 0.1% to 86.49p but remains at its highest level since late May 2017. Key economic data on British unemployment, wages, inflation and retail sales are due this week. Markets expect the Bank of England to hike interest rates by a quarter point next month. Marc Ostwald, global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London, said: With markets almost fully discounting a BOE rate hike, this week\u2019s run of monthly indicators are anticipated to give the hike a green light. Japan and China agree that a trade war will have serious consequences for the world economy, Japan\u2019s foreign minister Taro Kono has said today following high-level talks between the two countries. Kono told reporters after the first such dialogue in nearly eight years, according to Reuters: We have shared understanding that a trade war, no matter which country has brought it about, would have a very large impact on the prosperity of the international economy. There are fears that a trade row between China and the US could escalate, with the two nations threatening each other with higher tariffs. On currency markets, the dollar is struggling. It is flat against a broad basket of major currencies but has weakened 0.3% so far this month, and lost 2.5% since the start of the year. The euro is steady, trading at around $1.23. Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, told Reuters: The military strikes were well telegraphed and we are seeing a continuation in the broad market theme from lat week of a weaker dollar and favourable conditions for risk taking. European stock markets have given up some of their earlier gains. FTSE 100 index down 0.14% at 7254.60 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.12% at 12,457.13 France\u2019s CAC up 0.03% at 5316.83 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.17% at 23,369.72 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.19% at 9785.50 The rouble and Russian stocks are heading lower, dragged down by the threat of new US sanctions and falling oil prices. Washington said on Sunday it would impose further sanctions against Russia on Monday over Moscow\u2019s support for Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Details are expected later today. The rouble has lost 0.3% against the dollar to 62.24 and 0.4% against the euro to 76.85 Russia\u2019s dollar-denominated RTS index has fallen 0.66% while the rouble-based MOEX Russian index is down 0.35%. Oil prices have extended their losses, with Brent crude in London down more than $1 a barrel at $71.51, a 1.5% fall. Shire\u2019s sale of its oncology business includes leukaemia therapy Oncaspar, the rights to pancreatic cancer treatment Onyvyde outside the US and other drugs in development. Jefferies analysts Peter Welford, David Steinberg and Lucy Codrington believe the deal will boost Shire\u2019s negotiating position in any talks with Japan\u2019s biggest drugmaker Takeda, which has disclosed that it is considering a bid. We see the possible strategic fit given the company\u2019s focus therapeutic areas of oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience, with Shire bolstering the latter two franchises. Furthermore, Shire\u2019s leading global position in rare diseases would likely be attractive for most large pharma/biotech, particularly given the long duration assets in immunoglobulin and enzyme replacement therapy Takeda\u2019s current market value is around $37bn, down 6% since disclosing its interest in Shire, against the London-listed company\u2019s $47bn. The Jefferies analysts say: Hence, we presume Takeda would need a significant equity raise to acquire Shire, suggesting a \u201cmerger\u201d is perhaps better terminology, which may raise hurdles to the successful completion of any future deal. Analysts are cautious about whether WPP will be broken up, now that Sorrell is gone. Citi analysts Thomas Singlehurst and Catherine O\u2019Neill reckon the main question is whether a new WPP chief executive goes for a \u201cquick fix\u201d or sticks with the existing \u201cslow fix\u201d. In the last year, WPP has been seen by many to be losing its way. Against the backdrop of an improving macro environment, organic growth has been slowing. In practice this slowdown has been happening for years and has a multitude of explanatory factors. Anyone coming in to take over the CEO role at WPP will be entirely focused on turning this round. The debate is now whether a new CEO goes for a Quick Fix vs. (the existing) Slow Fix. Paul Richards, media analyst at Numis, says Sorrell will be hard to replace with one person. The succession has led to questions over the size and scope of WPP and we can see a change of management accelerating the current process of reducing overlap and increasing flexibility. Richards views Sorrell\u2019s resignation as \u201ctragic end to a remarkable career which saw the creation of WPP as a global leader in marcoms [marketing communications]\u201d. WPP has bought other holding companies (Y&amp;R, Grey, Cordiant) as well as agencies and accordingly has grown to employ over 200,000 people in 400 businesses across 3,000 offices in 112 countries. In response to industry pressures including clients in-sourcing activity, pressure on CPG and structural challenges from the duopoly of Facebook &amp; Google, WPP was already working to simplify its business and increase flexibility. We expect a new CEO to continue and accelerate this process and a strategic review could lead to the group slimming its operations by a quarter to a third in our view. WPP is due to report first-quarter results on 30 April. Sorrell is free to start a new advertising venture because he has never had a non-compete agreement, the Financial Times reports. In a farewell note to staff, Sir Martin underscored the role WPP had played in his career, saying the company was \u201cnot just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that\u201d. He also hinted at his next step when he signed off saying: \u201cBack to the future.\u201d WPP shares dropped as much as 5% in early trading and are now down 1.7% at \u00a311.67, with investors worried that Sorrell\u2019s departure leaves the world\u2019s biggest advertising group rudderless at a time when it might be broken up. European stock markets have opened higher, apart from the London stock market which has slipped slightly. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.12% Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.27% France\u2019s CAC flat Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.13% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.08% Shares in Whitbread have surged nearly 8%, replacing Shire as the top riser on the FTSE 100 index in early trading. Whitbread is under mounting pressure from hedge funds to break up its business by spinning off the Costa Coffee chain, after activist investor Elliott Advisors built up a stake of more than 6%. Shares in Shire have opened 2.6% on the news, making it the biggest riser on the FTSE 100. Shares in WPP have dropped 5% after the departure of chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell. London-listed drugmaker Shire, which specialises in rare diseases, is selling its oncology business to French drugmaker Servier for $2.4bn. The division generated revenues of $262m last year. Shire, which is a potential bid target for Japan\u2019s biggest drugmaker Takeda, said it would consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a share buyback. Shire\u2019s chief executive Flemming Ornskov hailed the sale as a key milestone for the company. While the oncology business has delivered high growth and profitability, we have concluded that it is not core to Shire\u2019s longer-term strategy. We will continue to evaluate our portfolio for opportunities to unlock further value and sharpen our focus on rare disease leadership with selective disposals of non-strategic assets. The proceeds from the transaction increase optionality and Shire\u2019s Board will consider returning the proceeds of the sale to shareholders through a shareholder-approved share buyback after the current offer period regarding Takeda\u2019s possible offer for Shire concludes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Following another week of gains last week, with Germany\u2019s Dax and the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index hitting six-week highs on Friday, European stock markets are set to open higher today. US stock futures are also up, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. Asian markets were mixed. The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 0.26% higher while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was 1.7% lower. There is relief that western missile strikes on Syria on Friday did not prompt a response from Russia, Syria\u2019s main ally, although traders will be watching cautiously for any signs of escalation of the conflict. Oil prices are slipping, with Brent crude in London down 1% to $71.83 a barrel while US crude is 0.9% lower at $66.79 a barrel. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: One of the main concerns last week was around the extent of the response by the US backed coalition on president Assad of Syria\u2019s forces and any Russian reaction to it. The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia. The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today. Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren. The International Monetary Fund holds its spring meetings of central bankers and finance ministers in Washington this week. The main corporate news at the weekend was the resignation of WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell. He is leaving the advertising group he founded more than three decades ago ahead of the findings of an investigation into alleged personal misconduct. He is in line for almost \u00a320m in payouts. His departure is seen as paving the way for a breakup of WPP. Here\u2019s a round-up of today\u2019s front pages.",

The firing of over 100 cruise missiles over the weekend on various targets, with little in the way of casualties, appears to be tempered with relief that while it may reduce the risk of an escalation in the short term, it in no way means that we might not get a counter response further down the line. As such markets here in Europe look set to open cautiously higher this morning after shares traded slightly firmer in Asia.</p> \n   <p>The US also appears to be complementing its military approach by focusing on the additional sanctions route, after UN ambassador Nikki Haley announced that further sanctions were being discussed on Russian companies who have dealings with Assad and the use of chemical weapons, with details likely to be announced by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later today.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Geopolitical developments and corporate earnings remain the main focus, in the absence of major economic news apart from US retail sales data for March, out at 13:30 BST. </p> \n  <p>In the UK, we will get the latest labour market stats tomorrow, followed by inflation on Wednesday and retail sales on Thursday, but today the calendar is barren.

      "bodyText": "Environmental leaders have dismissed BP\u2019s new low-carbon strategy as \u201cgreenwash\u201d and a lightweight response to climate change and the energy market\u2019s rapid switch to renewables. In a strategy published on Monday, BP said there would be no increase in its carbon footprint over the next seven years because it will cut emissions from its oil and gas rigs, and offset the rest. The UK oil firm said it would achieve a saving of 3.5m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2025. That is equal to about 7% of its current operational emissions. However, it still has no target for its biggest contribution to global warming, which is the burning of its main products, oil and gas, unlike rivals such as Shell. Tom Burke, the chairman of environmental thinktank E3G and a former BP adviser, said: \u201cWho cares about operational emissions? The problem is they have nothing to say on their product. This is a 20th century response to a 21st century problem.\u201d The former UK government adviser characterised the plan as \u201clightweight PR\u201d and \u201cgreenwash\u201d. He said BP had \u201cwasted 20 years\u201d since the former chief executive John Browne tried to reinvent the firm as Beyond Petroleum in 2000. The criticism was echoed by Carbon Tracker, a thinktank that has analysed the risk of big oil being left with stranded assets by action on climate change, a danger that the Bank of England has also warned of. \u201cImprovements in BP\u2019s operational emissions, while welcome, are too small to move the needle to prevent runaway climate change or reduce BP\u2019s exposure to carbon risk,\u201d Luke Sussams, the senior researcher at Carbon Tracker, said. Bob Dudley, BP\u2019s chief executive since 2010, said the company had ventured into clean energy too early last time. \u201cSome of our investments worked out \u2013 others did not. We were early but I don\u2019t think we were wrong because we learned valuable lessons along the way,\u201d he said. Due to the $65bn bill the company faced in the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster, it was only recently that it had been able to afford to move more into greener energy, he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s only been the last year or so that financially can we go into it deeper,\u201d he said. He said the company\u2019s low-carbon plan rests on cutting its own emissions, helping customers cut theirs and growing green energy businesses. Lord Browne, who led BP between 1995 and 2007, said the strategy was a \u201cgreat reset for BP\u201d and because of Deepwater Horizon it was understandable that clean energy had not been a recent focus for the firm. \u201cThere\u2019s only so many things you can focus on at once at a company,\u201d he said. As part of its emissions target, BP pledged to hold leaks of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, to today\u2019s levels, even as it targets more \u201cleaky\u201d production, such as shale in the US. The group spends about $500m (\u00a3351m) on biofuels, wind and solar power, about 3% of its annual $15bn-$16bn capital expenditure. Those low-carbon business units have the \u201cpotential to make a real contribution to our future,\u201d according to the strategy. The company hinted that it plans to make further moves into electric vehicle infrastructure, such as rapid charging points.",

      "bodyText": "On Thursday the singer-songwriter Billy Bragg will give a talk at the Bank of England about how to build a better society. Bragg, a pro-Corbyn activist and veteran protest singer, was invited as part of an effort to \u201cshake up\u201d thinking at the Bank, he told the Guardian this month. While Bragg\u2019s spot at Britain\u2019s central bank is highly unusual, his unpaid appearance is part of a wider trend that has pop and rock stars trading on their name recognition without necessarily selling CDs or records. Books, music coaching, public appearances, personalised birthday cards and house gigs are some of the ways musicians have been earning money to extend their careers or make up for dwindling royalties in the digital age. Often, fans are not interested in new music but want to interact with bands, as consumers spend more on experiences rather than buying physical goods such as CDs. Chris Difford, co-founder of Squeeze and the lyricist for hits including Tempted and Up the Junction, is touring the UK to promote his autobiography, Some Fantastic Place, and fans are there for his anecdotes as much as for the music. \u201cPeople do want an experience and they\u2019re not interested in CDs any more. When I ask the audience who\u2019s got a CD player, hardly anyone puts their hand up,\u201d Difford says. His royalties from Squeeze\u2019s most famous songs have slumped from \u00a325,000 a year in the 80s to \u00a31,500 now. Outside Squeeze, Difford makes money from an expanding portfolio of activities including songwriting workshops (he has also hosted masterclasses for the Guardian). A weekend workshop costs \u00a3500 a person and a week-long version \u00a31,200. On Saturday Difford travelled to Kendal in Cumbria to play as a 60th birthday present for a farmer who is a Squeeze fan. Difford charges \u00a31,000 for these house gigs. A sponsored podcast and a standup comedy set are next on his list. Difford is one of a growing collection of rockers publishing autobiographies. The genre has moved beyond globe-straddling celebrity tomes such as Rod Stewart\u2019s Rod: The Autobiography to more personal accounts such as Viv Albertine\u2019s memoir of her career in the Slits, Clothes, Music, Boys, and Bedsit Disco Queen by Everything But the Girl\u2019s Tracey Thorn. Pauline Black, lead singer of the Selecter, published her memoir, Black by Design, in 2011 and recently sold the film rights. She says the book, which describes growing up as a black woman in London and her role in the 2-Tone movement, has raised awareness of her and the band. In August, in a booking that echoes Bragg\u2019s Bank gig, she will be paid to give a hard-hitting talk about race and gender to an insurance company. \u201cThat\u2019s what they want and that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to get,\u201d she says. Miles Hunt, lead singer with the Wonder Stuff, has published three volumes of diaries charting the rise and disintegration of the band\u2019s original lineup in the 80s and early 90s. He funded the original print run by selling handwritten lyrics to fans but stopped after about 600 sets. \u201cIt got tiresome and there comes a point when you\u2019ve done too many and they become meaningless,\u201d he says. Fans can still receive a signed \u201cWondergram\u201d greetings card for \u00a315 from Hunt and someone with a spare \u00a31,500 can buy the tartan suit he wore at the time of hits The Size of a Cow and Dizzy. It\u2019s not only frontmen and women gaining a new lease of life. Rick Buckler, the Jam\u2019s former drummer, worked as a furniture restorer, website designer and roadie after the band split in 1982. Now he is co-writing his fourth Jam-related book in three years and has done speaking tours linked to his books. Mike Lindup, Level 42\u2019s keyboard player, has been offering music mentoring online for the past few months. At \u00a3250 an hour, take-up has been thin and Lindup says he is rethinking his prices. Next month he and Phil Gould, Level 42\u2019s former drummer and chief lyricist, will host the second of what Lindup hopes will be a series of evenings where they talk about their music. The \u00a335-a-ticket event, in Brighton, is a charity benefit although both men will pick up a fee. Lindup still tours with Level 42 and has worked as musical director for the Michael Jackson Thriller Live musical but that show\u2019s last tour took him away from home for 10 months. Despite co-writing hits such as Something About You, living off royalties is not an option, he says. \u201cTo make a living, feed the family and all that I need to be working but I\u2019m 59 with a young son and I\u2019d rather not be out on tour for months at a time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have to think creatively to say: \u2018What can I do so that I\u2019m fulfilled as an artist while making as good a living as I can?\u2019\u201d David Hepworth, author of Uncommon People: The Rise and Fall of the Rock Stars, says pop\u2019s heyday, when musicians grew rich as distant idols on a stage or a record cover, was a blip \u2013 though many rock careers have been surprisingly durable. \u201cNow the record sales have gone, these rock stars have got to go out and get the money directly from the customer,\u201d he says. \u201cSome deal with this better than others. They are lucky they still have the name recognition that allows them to do it.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The founder of JD Wetherspoon has said a decision to close all the pub chain\u2019s social media accounts was not a publicity stunt. The company\u2019s move to shut Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts for its 900 outlets was greeted with widespread scepticism. Tim Martin, who is also chairman of the company, said it was a business decision because social media had become a \u201cdistraction\u201d for the company. \u201cYou would have to be completely off your rocker to do a publicity stunt ... which banned the medium which is supposed to give you the most publicity,\u201d he told BBC News. Martin claimed that he was making a stand against social media because it had become a \u201cwaste of time\u201d for him and his pubs. \u201cOn a personal level many of us are fed up with social media and think it has got damaging effects and a lot of people are on it far far too much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do them any good it doesn\u2019t do the country any good. He added: \u201cThe people who aren\u2019t on social media wish that their friends weren\u2019t either, because they seem to be obsessed by it. And people who are on it feel they can\u2019t get off it because they are addicted.\u201d Asked if he could rule out rejoining social media platforms in future, Martin said: \u201cIf I have to crawl back to Facebook my goodness me that will be a catastrophe. It is not impossible, you have to keep your options open in business. But if I do it \u2013 what humiliation.\u201d Martin, who was a significant backer of the Vote Leave campaign, was also asked whether the controversy about the alleged use of Facebook data in the referendum had influenced his decision. He replied: \u201cIn politics and business people vastly overestimate social media. I campaigned very vigorously for leave and I did it through writing articles, speaking to the press and the television. I think tweets and Facebook underestimate the intelligence of the public and it\u2019s all a bit of marketing hype really.\u201d In a tweet that is no longer available, Martin said: \u201cWe are going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business. I don\u2019t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers.\u201d Martin is said to have taken the decision following recent publicity over the use of social media to criticise MPs and others, especially those from religious or ethnic minorities. However, the chain has failed to attract much of a following online, with 44,000 followers on Twitter and 100,000 on Facebook. Much of its activity on social media has been devoted to fending off complaints. Martin\u2019s statement said customers could use the Wetherspoon website and app to contact the company, or speak to pub managers. Media commentators predicted that the move would backfire. The chain has also been targeted by pro-Europeans for its support of Brexit, with calls from some to boycott its pubs. The company has often had to deal with hoax statements posted on social media. In November last year, the company was forced to refute a claim that staff had been banned from wearing Remembrance Day poppies while at work. Many of its 900 pubs have Facebook pages with fewer than 1,000 likes, meaning that anything they post is unlikely to be seen by users in their news feed. They are, however, still a magnet for bad reviews, which Facebook displays prominently. One pub, which has an overall star rating of 3.7, still has a review section headed \u201cPeople talk about terrible service\u201d, and both reviews on display are one-star complaints. The company\u2019s corporate HQ location page on Facebook has also attracted one-star reviews, including one in which a customer claims that her lost glasses were retrieved from a bin. The company has confirmed that no jobs will be affected by the move.",

      "body": "<p>The founder of JD Wetherspoon has said a decision to close all the pub chain\u2019s social media accounts was not a publicity stunt.</p> <p>The company\u2019s move to shut Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts for its 900 outlets was greeted with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/985796385097297920\">widespread scepticism</a>. Tim Martin, who is also chairman of the company, said it was a business decision because social media had become a \u201cdistraction\u201d for the company.</p> <p>\u201cYou would have to be completely off your rocker to do a publicity stunt ... which banned the medium which is supposed to give you the most publicity,\u201d he told BBC News.</p> <p>Martin claimed that he was making a stand against social media because it had become a \u201cwaste of time\u201d for him and his pubs.</p> <p>\u201cOn a personal level many of us are fed up with social media and think it has got damaging effects and a lot of people are on it far far too much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do them any good it doesn\u2019t do the country any good.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe people who aren\u2019t on social media wish that their friends weren\u2019t either, because they seem to be obsessed by it. And people who are on it feel they can\u2019t get off it because they are addicted.\u201d<br></p> <p>Asked if he could rule out rejoining social media platforms in future, Martin said: \u201cIf I have to crawl back to Facebook my goodness me that will be a catastrophe. It is not impossible, you have to keep your options open in business. But if I do it \u2013 what humiliation.\u201d</p> <p>Martin, who was a significant backer of the Vote Leave campaign, was also asked whether the controversy about the alleged use of Facebook data in the referendum had influenced his decision. </p> <p>He replied: \u201cIn politics and business people vastly overestimate social media. I campaigned very vigorously for leave and I did it through writing articles, speaking to the press and the television. I think tweets and Facebook underestimate the intelligence of the public and it\u2019s all a bit of marketing hype really.\u201d</p> <p>In a tweet that is no longer available, Martin said: \u201cWe are going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business.
