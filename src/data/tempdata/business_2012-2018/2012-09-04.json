    "webTitle": "Eurozone demands six-day week for Greece", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Greece's eurozone creditors are demanding that the government in Athens introduce a six-day working week as part of the stiff terms for the country's second bailout. The demand is contained in a leaked letter from the \"troika\" of the country's lenders, the European commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund. In the letter, the officials policing Greece's compliance with the austerity package imposed in return for the bailout insist on radical labour market reforms, from minimum wages to overtime limits to flexible working hours, that are likely to worsen the standoff between the government and organised labour in Greece. After a long delay caused by months of political paralysis in Greece, the troika inspectors return to Athens this week to scrutinise Greek observance of its bailout terms. They are expected to deliver a verdict next month that will determine whether Greece is ultimately allowed to remain in the single currency. The letter, sent last week to the Greek finance and labour ministries, orders the government to extend the working week into the weekend. \"Measure: increase flexibility of work schedules: increase the number of maximum workdays to six days per week for all sectors. \"Increase flexibility of work schedules; set the minimum daily rest to 11 hours; delink the working hours of employees from the opening hours of the establishment; eliminate restrictions on minimum/maximum time between morning and afternoon shifts; allow the consecutive two-week leave to be taken anytime during the year in seasonal sectors.\" The instructions focus on labour market reforms, calling for the national labour inspectorate to be radically reformed and put under European supervision. The letter reveals the detail of eurozone intrusion into a national system and culture of work widely seen outside Greece as dysfunctional. There should be a permanent \"single-rate statutory minimum wage\", seen as an incentive for getting people back to work in a country where unemployment has soared to over 24%. \"Unemployment is too high, and policies are needed to prevent it from becoming structural,\" the letter says. The letter also calls for non-wage labour costs to be lowered, employers' welfare contributions to be cut, and deregulation of the labour market. There is growing conviction in Berlin and Brussels that the government of Antonis Samaras in Athens has fallen well behind in the economic and fiscal reform programmes imposed in return for two bailouts in the past two years. The Greek government is struggling to come up with persuasive policies to enact spending cuts of a further \u20ac11.6 bn, which were to have been implemented in June, to secure the next bailout tranche of more than \u20ac30bn due next month. Samaras is pleading for more time \u2013 four years rather than two \u2013 to fulfil debt reduction targets and spending cuts. Extending the deadlines would effectively require more eurozone help and a third bailout. There is little appetite for more rescue funds across the eurozone, meaning that Greece may ultimately be sacrificed. Although statements on Greece in Berlin, Paris and Brussels have been more upbeat over the past fortnight, there is strong speculation in Berlin and Brussels that Greece may have to exit the euro, but not until after the US elections in November. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2012 because the original said that unemployment had soared to around 30% in Greece. The current official unemployment rate in Greece is 24.4%.",

      "body": "<p>Greece's eurozone creditors are demanding that the government in Athens introduce a six-day working week as part of the stiff terms for the country's second bailout.</p> <p>The demand is contained in a leaked letter from the \"troika\" of the country's lenders, the European commission, European Central Bank, and International Monetary Fund. In the letter, the officials policing Greece's compliance with the austerity package imposed in return for the bailout insist on radical labour market reforms, from minimum wages to overtime limits to flexible working hours, that are likely to worsen the standoff between the government and organised labour in Greece.</p> <p>After a long delay caused by months of political paralysis in Greece, the troika inspectors return to Athens this week to scrutinise Greek observance of its bailout terms. They are expected to deliver a verdict next month that will determine whether Greece is ultimately allowed to remain in the single currency.</p> <p>The letter, sent last week to the Greek finance and labour ministries, orders the government to extend the working week into the weekend.</p> <p>\"Measure: increase flexibility of work schedules: increase the number of maximum workdays to six days per week for all sectors.</p> <p>\"Increase flexibility of work schedules; set the minimum daily rest to 11 hours; delink the working hours of employees from the opening hours of the establishment; eliminate restrictions on minimum/maximum time between morning and afternoon shifts; allow the consecutive two-week leave to be taken anytime during the year in seasonal sectors.\"</p> <p>The instructions focus on labour market reforms, calling for the national labour inspectorate to be radically reformed and put under European supervision.</p> <p>The letter reveals the detail of eurozone intrusion into a national system and culture of work widely seen outside Greece as dysfunctional.</p> <p>There should be a permanent \"single-rate statutory minimum wage\", seen as an incentive for getting people back to work in a country where unemployment has soared to over 24%.</p> <p>\"Unemployment is too high, and policies are needed to prevent it from becoming structural,\" the letter says.</p> <p>The letter also calls for non-wage labour costs to be lowered, employers' welfare contributions to be cut, and deregulation of the labour market.</p> <p>There is growing conviction in Berlin and Brussels that the government of Antonis Samaras in Athens has fallen well behind in the economic and fiscal reform programmes imposed in return for two bailouts in the past two years.</p> <p>The Greek government is struggling to come up with persuasive policies to enact spending cuts of a further \u20ac11.6 bn, which were to have been implemented in June, to secure the next bailout tranche of more than \u20ac30bn due next month.</p> <p>Samaras is pleading for more time \u2013 four years rather than two \u2013 to fulfil debt reduction targets and spending cuts.</p> <p>Extending the deadlines would effectively require more eurozone help and a third bailout. There is little appetite for more rescue funds across the eurozone, meaning that Greece may ultimately be sacrificed.</p> <p>Although statements on Greece in Berlin, Paris and Brussels have been more upbeat over the past fortnight, there is strong speculation in Berlin and Brussels that Greece may have to exit the euro, but not until after the US elections in November.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2012 because the original said that unemployment had soared to around 30% in Greece. The current official unemployment rate in Greece is 24.4%.</p>",

Russia is one of the world's busiest mobile phone markets, with the third-highest penetration in the world behind the United Arab Emirates and Panama.

Five other networks have around 38m subscriptions between them. Investors will be keen to buy a slice of the fast-growing company, analysts said, which comes as the mobile operators jostle for position in the race to sell 4G (fourth-generation) mobile services to the public. In July, Usmanov increased his influence in Russia's telecoms sector by combining his MegaFon stake into a holding company he controls that will own state-backed next-generation operator Scartel. The same month MegaFon was one of four companies to win a 4G licence, allowing it to provide superfast wireless internet using the LTE service, which is expected to become the global industry standard.

Notable Russian IPOs since include aluminium group Rusal's $2.2bn listing in Hong Kong in 2010 and internet search engine Yandex's $1.4bn float on the US Nasdaq exchange in May 2011. Waiting in the wings is Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, after forecast-beating quarterly results last week raised the likelihood that the often-delayed sale of a 7.6% state holding worth $5bn would go ahead. Mid-sized lender Promsvyazbank has also sought clearance from the regulator to float up to 25% in London in a deal managers have said could raise $1bn. A MegaFon IPO would be a defining deal for Usmanov, an Uzbek-born metals and mining magnate who has shown a deft touch as a tech investor and made 10 times his money investing in Facebook stock three years before it listed. But the enthusiasm for new technology offerings may have been dimmed by the dismal performance of Facebook shares after its $16bn offering: the shares floated at $38 but are now trading below $18, even while global stock markets have drifted higher through the summer.

      "bodyText": "A rise in Spanish unemployment \u2013 already the highest in Europe at 25% \u2013 added to the woes of prime minister Mariano Rajoy as he tried to fight off a bailout of the eurozone's fourth largest economy. With the economically vital tourist season coming to a close and the country sliding further into double-dip recession, Spain's dole queues looked set to get still longer over the coming months. Increased unemployment benefit payments are already putting pressure on Rajoy's budget plans, with figures released on Tuesday showing a 5% increase for the first seven months of the year. The budget minister, Crist\u00f3bal Montoro, had predicted that benefit payments, which fall over time for the long-term unemployed, would actually come down by 5% this year. The miscalculation may add several billion euros to the budget deficit, ramping up pressure on Rajoy as the recession hits tax income, borrowing costs soar and big-spending regional governments struggle to finance themselves and reduce their own deficits. With the markets on tenterhooks ahead of Thursday's meeting of the ECB, the bad news from Spain compounded a decision by Moody's ratings agency to place the entire European Union on negative outlook, citing the mounting financial strain of the crisis on key countries like Germany, France and Britain. Britain's FTSE 100 closed down 1.5% at 5672.01 while Germany's DAX lost 1.2% to 6932.58 and France's CAC 40 dropped 1.6%. The Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street dropped 0.6% as the key ISM manufacturing index showed the sector continuing to shrink last month. Analysts increasingly believe that Spain, which has already been given up to \u20ac100bn of eurozone money to rescue its banks, will be forced into seeking a full bailout. Jens Nordvig, a forex strategist at Nomura, said that capital flight from Spain was an indicator that the country was on the path to bailout. Some \u20ac98bn left in May and June alone. \"The scale of capital flight that took place over the last few months in Spain supports this view,\" Nordvig wrote in a note to clients quoted by CNBC, adding that capital flight from Spain was now worse than from Indonesia during the 1990s crisis in Asia. Spanish banks will start tapping a \u20ac100bn bailout facility in coming weeks as they struggle to cope with a vast pile of toxic real estate assets left over from a property bubble that exploded four years ago. Four Spanish banks, including the fourth biggest, BFA/Bankia have been part-nationalised after being overwhelmed by the bad loans they gave to real estate developers. Bankia needed a further \u20ac4.5bn emergency injection of capital from Spain's state FROB rescue fund on Monday as it prepared itself for the eurozone bailout. In the first half of this year alone the four nationalised banks increased the amount of toxic real estate assets on their books from \u20ac56bn to \u20ac71bn as loans continued to sour, according to a study of their accounts by El Pa\u00eds newspaper. Bankia admitted to some \u20ac3bn (or 10%) more in loans to developers than it did six months ago. This was not because it had started lending again, but because these loans had only recently been reclassified at the former savings banks which came together to form Bankia. Bankia and the other nationalised banks \u2013 CatalunyaBanc, NCG Banco/Novagalicia and Banco de Valencia \u2013 are due to offload their toxic real estate onto a new bad bank which will be set up by the end of November as part of the eurozone rescue deal. The \"bad bank\" will have up to 15 years to sell them and try to make a profit. Some \u20ac28bn worth of property has already been foreclosed by these banks, meaning that they now own it, with almost half of that building land in a country that already has some 600,000 unsold residential properties. Rajoy will meet Germany's Angel Merkel in Madrid on Thursday, the same day that European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi is expected to reveal details of a plan to shore up Spanish and Italian bond prices. Moody's credit rating agency is due to review Spain by the end of the month and could downgrade its debt to junk status, blocking it from markets.",

      "body": "<p>What if members of the United States Congress, now returning from their summer recess, were to receive a \"back to school\" letter from concerned citizens? Here is what a first draft might look like.</p> <h2>Dear Member of Congress:</h2> <p>Welcome back to the Capitol. We hope that you had a good summer break, and that you return to Washington not just rested, but also energised to take on our country's mounting economic challenges.</p> <p>The news has been mixed during your absence. We have seen some improvement in economic data, but not enough to suggest that we are any closer to overcoming decisively this painful period of low growth and high unemployment. And, with a self-inflicted fiscal cliff looming \u2013 one that could send our country back into recession, pulling the rest of the world with us \u2013 businesses are reluctant to hire and invest in new capital goods. Fortunately, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/31/markets-fed-chairman-ben-bernanke?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Federal Reserve has signalled its intention to remain active</a>, but its policy tools are poorly suited to the challenges that we face.</p> <p>Meanwhile, global difficulties remain substantial. We continue to face strong headwinds originating from the deepening European debt crisis, as well as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. China, once the world's unstoppable growth engine, is slowing. And, despite all the happy talk, multilateral policy co-ordination is essentially non-existent.</p> <p>All of this calls for courageous and visionary economic leadership; otherwise, our problems will fester and grow, and the solutions will become even more complex. Already, too many of our economy's difficulties, including worrisome trends in youth joblessness and long-term unemployment, risk becoming structurally embedded.</p> <p>No doubt you have also noticed that, with less than 10 weeks to go until the November presidential election, our country is in the grip of an increasingly ugly political campaign. So, with this combination of bad economics and bad politics, we look to you for direction and leadership. It is that simple, and that important.</p> <p>We need you to overcome a prolonged period of congressional paralysis and polarisation in order to address the country's malaise. We need you to pivot in your responses from the tactical to the strategic, from the cyclical to the secular, from the partial to the comprehensive, and from sequential to simultaneous reforms.</p> <p>If this call to national duty is not enough, we would remind you of your own self-interest. According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, your support among us, the electorate, stands at just 12%.</p> <p>We concede that there is no magic wand to overcome our country's problems. After all, for too many years leading up to the global financial crisis, America \"bought\" and \"borrowed\" its growth by leveraging balance sheets, rather than \"earning\" it through increased competitiveness. The result was massive misallocation of human resources, insufficient infrastructure investment, over-reliance on credit entitlements, and, of course, unsustainable debt. To make matters worse, this occurred at a time when systemically important emerging economies hit their \"developmental breakout phase,\" powered by trade and other aspects of globalisation.</p> <p>We do not expect you to solve America's problems overnight. Instead, we look to you to embark on an appropriate and sustainable policy path. So, as you unpack your bags and renew old friendships and rivalries, please keep the following in mind.</p> <p>Changing course requires that you, together with the president, have a much more open and consistent economic dialogue with us, the general public, about the challenges that we face. It also requires that you and the president converge on a multi-prong, multi-year policy initiative that, at a minimum, makes simultaneous advances in six critical areas:</p> <p>\u2022 Fiscal reform: We desperately need you to eliminate the looming fiscal cliff in the context of medium-term reforms of both the tax system and entitlements. This would also allow for greater fiscal stimulus at a time when other components of aggregate demand are slowing.</p> <p>\u2022 Labour-market reform: Persistently high unemployment and large-scale withdrawal from the labour force are a constant reminder of a malfunctioning labour market that needs support through better training and retooling. Reform must also address the related challenges of a lagging education system and an insufficient social safety net.</p> <p>\u2022 Housing and housing finance: At the root of the global financial crisis, the troubled US housing market continues to act as a millstone around the economy's neck. The longer the problems persist, the greater the pressure on consumer and business sentiment, and the harder it is for the unemployed to find and relocate to new job opportunities.</p> <p>\u2022 Clogged credit pipes: With banks' balance sheets contracting, too many small and medium-size companies are unable to mobilise credit for investment and growth. Recognising that it will take years until banks are properly stabilised, America needs to build new conduits for credit.</p> <p>\u2022 Infrastructure: Those of you who have travelled abroad know that our infrastructure is desperately lagging that of a growing number of countries. This makes it even harder for our companies to compete and prosper.</p> <p>\u2022 Global policy co-ordination: America's traditional leadership role has evaporated in recent years as our problems have made us more insular and inward-looking. This would not be a major problem if the resulting vacuum had been filled. But that has not happened. On the contrary, the G7 has lost relevance, the International Monetary Fund is hampered by its representation and legitimacy deficits, and the G20 is still finding its feet.</p> <p>Engineering such an agenda is not an overwhelming challenge. But that will provide little comfort if you, our elected representatives, do not collaborate effectively.</p> <p>The choice Congress faces this term is simple: either address head on America's challenges, or risk being remembered as the body whose dithering condemned future generations to being worse off than their parents.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,</p> <p>Concerned citizens</p> <p>__________________________________________________________</p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2012</p>",

We hope that you had a good summer break, and that you return to Washington not just rested, but also energised to take on our country's mounting economic challenges. The news has been mixed during your absence. We have seen some improvement in economic data, but not enough to suggest that we are any closer to overcoming decisively this painful period of low growth and high unemployment. And, with a self-inflicted fiscal cliff looming \u2013 one that could send our country back into recession, pulling the rest of the world with us \u2013 businesses are reluctant to hire and invest in new capital goods. Fortunately, the Federal Reserve has signalled its intention to remain active, but its policy tools are poorly suited to the challenges that we face. Meanwhile, global difficulties remain substantial. We continue to face strong headwinds originating from the deepening European debt crisis, as well as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. China, once the world's unstoppable growth engine, is slowing. And, despite all the happy talk, multilateral policy co-ordination is essentially non-existent. All of this calls for courageous and visionary economic leadership; otherwise, our problems will fester and grow, and the solutions will become even more complex. Already, too many of our economy's difficulties, including worrisome trends in youth joblessness and long-term unemployment, risk becoming structurally embedded. No doubt you have also noticed that, with less than 10 weeks to go until the November presidential election, our country is in the grip of an increasingly ugly political campaign. So, with this combination of bad economics and bad politics, we look to you for direction and leadership. It is that simple, and that important. We need you to overcome a prolonged period of congressional paralysis and polarisation in order to address the country's malaise. We need you to pivot in your responses from the tactical to the strategic, from the cyclical to the secular, from the partial to the comprehensive, and from sequential to simultaneous reforms. If this call to national duty is not enough, we would remind you of your own self-interest. According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, your support among us, the electorate, stands at just 12%. We concede that there is no magic wand to overcome our country's problems. After all, for too many years leading up to the global financial crisis, America \"bought\" and \"borrowed\" its growth by leveraging balance sheets, rather than \"earning\" it through increased competitiveness. The result was massive misallocation of human resources, insufficient infrastructure investment, over-reliance on credit entitlements, and, of course, unsustainable debt. To make matters worse, this occurred at a time when systemically important emerging economies hit their \"developmental breakout phase,\" powered by trade and other aspects of globalisation. We do not expect you to solve America's problems overnight. Instead, we look to you to embark on an appropriate and sustainable policy path. So, as you unpack your bags and renew old friendships and rivalries, please keep the following in mind. Changing course requires that you, together with the president, have a much more open and consistent economic dialogue with us, the general public, about the challenges that we face. It also requires that you and the president converge on a multi-prong, multi-year policy initiative that, at a minimum, makes simultaneous advances in six critical areas: \u2022 Fiscal reform: We desperately need you to eliminate the looming fiscal cliff in the context of medium-term reforms of both the tax system and entitlements. This would also allow for greater fiscal stimulus at a time when other components of aggregate demand are slowing. \u2022 Labour-market reform: Persistently high unemployment and large-scale withdrawal from the labour force are a constant reminder of a malfunctioning labour market that needs support through better training and retooling. Reform must also address the related challenges of a lagging education system and an insufficient social safety net. \u2022 Housing and housing finance: At the root of the global financial crisis, the troubled US housing market continues to act as a millstone around the economy's neck. The longer the problems persist, the greater the pressure on consumer and business sentiment, and the harder it is for the unemployed to find and relocate to new job opportunities. \u2022 Clogged credit pipes: With banks' balance sheets contracting, too many small and medium-size companies are unable to mobilise credit for investment and growth. Recognising that it will take years until banks are properly stabilised, America needs to build new conduits for credit. \u2022 Infrastructure: Those of you who have travelled abroad know that our infrastructure is desperately lagging that of a growing number of countries. This makes it even harder for our companies to compete and prosper. \u2022 Global policy co-ordination: America's traditional leadership role has evaporated in recent years as our problems have made us more insular and inward-looking. This would not be a major problem if the resulting vacuum had been filled. But that has not happened. On the contrary, the G7 has lost relevance, the International Monetary Fund is hampered by its representation and legitimacy deficits, and the G20 is still finding its feet. Engineering such an agenda is not an overwhelming challenge. But that will provide little comfort if you, our elected representatives, do not collaborate effectively. The choice Congress faces this term is simple: either address head on America's challenges, or risk being remembered as the body whose dithering condemned future generations to being worse off than their parents.
