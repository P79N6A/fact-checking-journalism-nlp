      "bodyText": "Shops in Britain face a perfect storm of rising costs and falling consumer spending in 2017, one of the world\u2019s leading commercial property agents has warned, raising the possibility of more closures after the demise of BHS last year. Retailers will have to contend with rising inflation, labour costs and taxes at the same time as consumers tighten their belts, piling on the pressure for businesses that are already having to deal with the rise of online shopping, according to property agent JLL. The warning of a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for retailers is similar to comments made by Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, in late 2015 that the industry faced a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d. Lewis warned that retailers faced \u00a314bn of extra costs over the next five years due to an increase in business rates, the apprenticeship levy and the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. The British Retail Consortium has warned that the strain on the sector and the structural changes taking place could lead to up to 900,000 jobs being lost and 74,000 shops being closed over the next decade. In total the industry in the UK employs about 3m people and has 270,000 shops. In its annual predictions for the year ahead, JLL warned that retailers would be hurt by the weakness in sterling leading to an increase in the cost of importing goods. However, it said that any fall in consumer spending is unlikely to be uniform across the country, with major high streets and shopping centres demonstrating \u201cresilience at the expense of less relevant centres that have been slow to respond to cyclical and structural change\u201d. Tim Vallance, head of UK retail and leisure at JLL, said: \u201cIn 2017, retailers will endure a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of rising inflation, labour costs, import costs and in some cases business rates, ongoing ecommerce\u2013led structural change, in addition to a potential reduction in consumer spend. \u201cIn particular, rising import costs as a result of post-referendum currency fluctuations may have to be passed on to the consumer, or retailer margins will be cut. Larger retailers will be better positioned to bear the impact, offsetting it by currency hedging and economies of scale.\u201d Retailers will feel particularly squeezed from April, when the national living wage will increase from \u00a37.20 to \u00a37.50 and business rates will move in line with the latest revaluation of Britain\u2019s property. The revaluation of business rates is expected to result in a sharp increase in tax payments for shops in central London, supermarkets, and shopping centres. However, struggling town centres, especially in the north and west of the country, should enjoy a much-needed tax cut.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The liquidators of BHS are conducting a detailed investigation into property transactions that took place during the regimes of Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell, including whether the directors of the retailer breached their duties. Insolvency practitioners have a legal duty to review the conduct of the directors of a collapsed company, but the scope and depth of the BHS investigation is rare. FRP Advisory is undertaking a \u201cmassive exercise in data collation\u201d, according to one source close to the winding up of BHS. BHS collapsed into administration last April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a \u00a3571m pension deficit. A parliamentary investigation into the failure of the department store chain concluded that it had been systematically plundered under the ownership of Green and Chappell. Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a former bankrupt, for \u00a31. During his ownership, the Green family and other shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from BHS in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans. Chappell\u2019s company, Retail Acquisitions, received payments of up to \u00a325m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed. The parliamentary committee that investigated BHS questioned Green and Chappell about a series of property deals. Green was criticised over the sale by Arcadia, his retail business, of BHS\u2019s shop in Ealing, west London, to a company run by his stepson less than a week before BHS was sold to Chappell. Brett Palos, who also appeared before MPs during their inquiry, bought the store for \u00a36.9m through his company Thackeray Estates, then sold it for a \u00a33m profit three months later. Chappell also sold BHS\u2019s main warehouse in Atherstone, Warwickshire, for \u00a315m to a company that has one of his friends, Mahmood Ismailjee, as a director. Green told MPs he was not involved the Ealing transaction and that the company had valued the property before selling it. Chappell has insisted he acted properly as a director throughout his tenure at BHS. Under corporate law, directors have a duty not to sell assets at an undervalue if a business is at risk of collapse. If a director is found to have breached this duty, he is at risk of being disqualified by the Insolvency Service. Liquidators can apply to the court to reverse a transaction at an undervalue if it occurred within two years of the insolvency. A spokesman for FRP said: \u201cWe will be continuing our process of making recoveries through liquidation on behalf of all creditors and continuing with our statutory duties.\u201d However, the firm revealed more details about its work in a progress report sent to creditors of BHS at the end of November, just before the retailer moved from administration. FRP said: \u201cThe concurrent administrators [FRP] have commenced their enquiries into a number of historic matters of concern and key transactions, including those raised by the parliamentary enquiry into the company\u2019s failure, and they are working with their legal advisers, Jones Day, to determine appropriate avenues of further investigation. \u201cIt would not be appropriate to comment in detail on the nature and level of the concurrent administrators\u2019 investigations at this juncture. However, within the parameters of the court order, these have included a review of the possible claims and challenges available to an insolvency office holder pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 and Insolvency Act 1986, including those relating to antecedent transactions and wrongful trading.\u201d FRP was brought in to be the joint administrator to BHS with Duff &amp; Phelps \u2013 then the sole liquidator \u2013 by the Pension Protection fund, the biggest creditor. Green, who spent Christmas and new year in Florida, remains in talks with the Pensions Regulator about a settlement for the BHS pension scheme. He has until March to reach a deal before the regulator moves to the next stage of its legal proceedings against him. Chappell said the period since BHS collapsed had been \u201cextremely difficult\u201d and that Retail Acquisitions did \u201ceverything we possibly could\u201d to save the retailer. \u201cEverybody has been under very close scrutiny,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have complied with every regulatory body, of which there is five we have been dealing with. We have been open and frank with them right the way through and living up to our fiduciary care as directors of a business that has failed. \u201cAs it has been stated, we took huge amounts of legal advice right the way through, from the start to the finish of BHS. We complied with every single thing that we needed to do as directors and at no stage did we trade immorally.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Harrods workers say company keeps up to 75% of restaurant service charge", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Harrods has been accused of shortchanging its restaurant staff in the latest row over how service charges added to diners\u2019 bills are shared among workers. The union representing Harrods waiters and kitchen staff believes the Qatari owner of the upmarket London department store retains up to 75% of the service charge, a situation it says reduces their pay by up to \u00a35,000 a year. The United Voices of the World union (UVW) says an unspecified percentage of the service charge collected at Harrods\u2019 16 cafes and restaurants is shared among the 483 kitchen and waiting staff. It is organising a demonstration outside the Knightsbridge department store on Saturday as part of a call for greater transparency. A Harrods spokeswoman confirmed that, like many businesses in the hospitality sector, the company operated a \u201ctronc\u201d system, whereby the service charge is shared out. \u201cHarrods is taking steps to improve the current system through which it distributes its service charge, to ensure it best serves our employees and is completing a detailed review into the existing scheme,\u201d she said. \u201cAs this is an ongoing review, we are unable to provide further details on the distribution. However, employees will be informed of the details of the new system as soon as the review is complete.\u201d Petros Elia, the UVW general secretary, said: \u201cCustomers expect the service charge to go to staff and that\u2019s where it should go. If Harrods feels the need to retain a percentage they should explain why.\u201d What happens to the cash generated by the service charge applied to bar and restaurant bills has become a moot point. The TV chef Michel Roux Jr admitted in December that his Michelin-starred restaurant Le Gavroche classed service charge income as revenue rather than tips to be shared among staff. He has since said the restaurant would scrap the charge from the end of January. The chef also apologised following a Guardian report in November which revealed that Roux was paying some of his staff less than the minimum wage at his Mayfair restaurant, where the menu includes starters costing as much as \u00a362.80 for lobster mousse with caviar and champagne sauce. Fortnum &amp; Mason, another high-end London department store, is also trying to persuade staff at its Heathrow bar to move over to a tronc system.Fortnum &amp; Mason does not currently distribute any of the 12.5% service charge collected on drinkers\u2019 bills at Heathrow. Accounts filed at Companies House show that Harrods\u2019 owner, Qatar Holding \u2013 the investment arm of the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund that acquired the store from Mohamed Al Fayed in 2010 for an estimated \u00a31.5bn \u2013 paid itself a \u00a3100.1m dividend in 2016. That followed a record year in which pre-tax profits increased 19% to \u00a3168m. Sales rose 4% to \u00a31.4bn in the year to 30 January 2016. The highest-paid director, presumed to be its managing director, Michael Ward, earned \u00a31.6m. The retailer attracts high-spending overseas tourists and Ward told the Guardian that it had been insulated from the economic gloom emerging in the UK since the Brexit vote. \u201cChristmas has been particularly strong this year,\u201d he said, pointing to solid demand for bags, shoes and diamonds, with Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci among the most popular brands. \u201cThe top end of the market is always less affected than anyone else \u2026 from our perspective we\u2019ve got great local customers plus we\u2019ve seen more international customers come to London.\u201d Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, was founded in 2005 to help the Gulf state strengthen its economy by investing its oil and gas riches in other assets. This article was amended on 4 January 2017. The original said the service charge is shared out, but only if staff accept a cut in basic pay. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has accused Philip Hammond of failing to cancel a \u201ctax giveaway\u201d by his predecessor to Britain\u2019s biggest banks, worth more than \u00a31bn this year. In his summer budget after the 2015 general election, the then chancellor George Osborne announced deep cuts to the bank levy, which was introduced after the financial crisis and charged according to the size of banks\u2019 balance sheets. Big banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, which felt penalised by the levy, told him that they could move their headquarters outside the UK. Osborne announced phased cuts in the levy over the parliament and made up the shortfall in revenue by imposing an 8% surcharge on banks\u2019 corporation tax, which falls on all lenders, not just the largest. McDonnell said by failing to reverse the cuts in the bank levy in November\u2019s autumn statement, Hammond was handing the big banks a rebate taxpayers could ill afford. The latest forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, published alongside the autumn statement, showed revenue from the bank levy at \u00a32.7bn for the current financial year, instead of the \u00a33.8bn expected in March 2015, before the general election. \u201cPhilip Hammond tried to sneak out the fact that he has continued this cut in the bank levy, which will provide big banks with a tax giveaway larger than under even George Osborne. \u201cThe fact that we are seeing such a large handout to the biggest banks in our country at a time when we are seeing cuts to our schools, NHS and a funding crisis in our care service is truly shameful.\u201d McDonnell, who is the closest ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, will make a major speech on economic policy this month and hopes to draw a clear dividing line with the Conservatives by showing that he would take on vested interests as chancellor. He recently made a series of spending pledges to protect pensioner benefits, including the costly triple-lock guarantee (that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, consumer price index or 2.5%, whichever is highest), in an effort to win over elderly voters. Labour also wants to show that it will fight to avoid a \u201cbankers\u2019 Brexit\u201d \u2013 protecting the interests of the City at the expense of ordinary taxpayers \u2013 though it has said it would like to see the continuation of \u201cpassporting\u201d, the regime allowing UK-based banks to trade throughout the EU. A spokesman for McDonnell said Labour would reverse the cuts to the levy and would be unlikely to remove the corporation tax surcharge, because it came alongside a series of cuts in the corporation tax rate which had reduced big corporations\u2019 tax liability. When the government announced that policy, the Treasury minister Harriet Baldwin told MPs: \u201cIt means that the overall rate of corporation tax will be slightly lower for banks than it was in 2010.\u201d Britain\u2019s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), warned that the shift to the corporation tax levy would reduce the advantages of the tax system for smaller banks trying to break into the market. So-called challenger banks told the CMA they expected to be paying up to \u00a3123m more in tax between them by 2020-21 as a result of the changes. \u201cThe overall effect, compared with the pre-2016 position, is that the tax advantages of smaller banks including new entrants have been reduced as a result of the changes to the bank levy and the introduction of the CTS [corporation tax surcharge]. Therefore, any effect that these tax advantages had in offsetting the barriers to entry and expansion such banks face are likely to be reduced,\u201d the CMA said. A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cThe government is clear that banks, like all businesses, must pay the right amount of tax. The reform of the bank levy was announced alongside the introduction of a new 8% surcharge on bank profit. Together, the levy and the surcharge are expected to raise over \u00a318bn from banks over the next five years.\u200e\u201d McDonnell also called for Hammond to abandon \u201cdeeply unfair\u201d cuts to the corporation tax rate, saying the money could have been used to fund teachers, nurses and police officers. The rate has been reduced from 28% in 2010 when David Cameron became prime minister, to 20% and will fall to 19% in April under plans to reduce it to 17% in 2020. The cuts will be worth almost \u00a315bn a year to businesses by 2021 and Labour claims this is equivalent to employing 12,000 nurses, 10,000 police officers and 10,000 teachers full-time every year for a decade. McDonnell said: \u201cWe have known for a long time that the Tories\u2019 cuts to corporation tax have cost the exchequer billions and today we have laid bare what this means for our public services. \u201cLabour is calling on the government to reverse these deeply unfair tax giveaways and start properly investing in our vital public services.\u201d",

The average advertised salary fell to \u00a332,221 in November from \u00a333,118 a year earlier according to Adzuna, the jobs search engine. They were down 1.5% compared with October\u2019s \u00a332,725. The biggest annual drop in advertised salaries was in the retail sector, where the average fell by 17.4% to \u00a321,769. Adzuna said the sharp fall was partly down to a rise in the number of more low-paid temporary jobs . Other sectors to record big pay cuts included consultancy, down 16.4% in the year to November, customer service jobs, down 11.3%, and warehouse jobs, down 10.3%. The number of jobs advertised hit a 12-month high of 1.165m in November \u2013 a 0.2% rise compared with October, but 6.4% lower than the same month in 2015. Doug Monro, co-founder of Adzuna, said: \u201cThe jobs market has fared well in the main this year, given the unexpected events within the political climate. \u201cDespite total advertised vacancies increasing significantly, it may be too early to brand the jobs market a complete success given salary stagnation and the unpredictability that may lie ahead in the new year.\u201d Economists have warned that 2017 will be a tougher year for consumers and businesses, with lower growth, higher inflation and weak wage growth. Uncertainty is also expected to rise next year as Brexit negotiations begin. \u201c2017 will certainly bring new prospects and challenges for the jobs market and the sooner Brexit plans are confirmed, the sooner businesses and individuals will be able to plan for the future with more certainty,\u201d Munro said. Adzuna said competition for jobs was at an all-time low in November, with 0.43 jobseekers per vacancy. The search engine site said that over 2016, Cambridge was the best place to find a job with more than 10 vacancies to every jobseeker. Sunderland was the toughest, with 3.48 jobseekers for every job advertised. The latest official figures painted a mixed picture of the jobs market in the months following the EU referendum in June. The employment rate fell for the first time in a year and a half in the three months to October, to 74.4% from 74.5% according to the Office for National Statistics. However, the number of people classed as unemployed dropped by 16,000 to 1.62 million and the jobless rate remained unchanged at 4.8%.",
