      "bodyText": "The Russian-speaking caller refused to give a name but the threat was explicit: \u201cDo you really feel you can walk home safely at night?\u201d It was 2013 and officers at the Estonian branch of Danske Bank were beginning to realise they had taken on some very unpleasant customers. After a tipoff, a member of staff had travelled to Moscow and started asking questions. The team was trying to trace the identity of people hiding behind anonymous corporate vehicles, which had opened accounts and were now using them to transfer huge sums of money. That was when its staff began to receive anonymous threats. \u201cThis bank will sink,\u201d one caller warned. Today, Danske is still very much in business, but its chief executive, Thomas Borgen, has resigned. He fell on his sword after a report produced by lawyers for his board, published on Wednesday, revealed the full extent of problems at the Estonian branch. It had thousands of suspicious customers, responsible for \u20ac200bn (\u00a3180bn) of transactions over a nine-year period. The realisation is dawning that what has been uncovered is probably the largest ever money-laundering scandal in history. \u201cEurope has a major money-laundering problem,\u201d said anti-corruption expert Nienke Palstra, at campaign group Global Witness. \u201cUntil we see senior executives held fully accountable for criminal wrongdoing and serious fines for the banks involved, this kind of scandal will continue for decades to come.\u201d Regulators and law enforcement agencies are slowly beginning to respond. Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency (NCA) has confirmed it is investigating an anonymous corporate vehicle linked to the scandal. For the moment, this is a civil, not a criminal case, which means no individuals will be prosecuted. The US is taking an interest. The justice department, the treasury department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates US stock markets, are reportedly involved. Denmark\u2019s regulator, the Financial Supervisory Authority, has reopened an investigation that it had closed in May. Its first inquiry resulted in a reprimand, but no fine. Now the authority will look at whether management should face legal action. Its head, Jesper Berg, told the Financial Times: \u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand that there\u2019s a lot of public uproar. It\u2019s a continuation of the financial crisis. There\u2019s this sense of unmet consequences for the financial sector.\u201d Before being rewarded with the top job, Borgen had been responsible for Estonia as Danske\u2019s head of international operations from 2009-12. The chief executive, in his resignation statement, said the report concluded he had \u201clived up\u201d to his legal obligations. There are concerns, however, that the person at the helm during a catastrophic failure of the bank\u2019s internal controls is not leaving immediately. Borgen is being retained until a replacement is found and, as part of his contract, he is entitled to collect a year\u2019s pay. Many questions remain unanswered. Even as the number of law enforcement agencies trying to tackle the Danske problem grows, doubts are mounting about their ability to bring prosecutions. Money laundering is a transnational crime. The Danske scandal involves 32 currencies, companies from Cyprus, the British Virgin Islands and the Seychelles. Customers of the Estonian branch have been traced to Russia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine. One scheme run through the branch reportedly involved Azerbaijan\u2019s ruling elite, and a $2.9bn (\u00a32.2bn) fund used to pay European politicians and lobbyists. \u201cMoney laundering is a globalised industry and if you operate on a domestic basis you might as well not bother,\u201d said Tom Keatinge, the director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. A former investment banker, Keatinge worked at JP Morgan for 20 years before turning his attention to combating fraud. \u201cThe borders are immaterial to you when you are structuring these transactions, whereas the borders are not immaterial for the cops who are trying to chase you.\u201d Last week, the European commission put forward proposals to create the EU\u2019s first genuine cross-border anti-money laundering force. The European Banking Authority will see its relevant investigations team increased from two people to 10, and the agency is to be handed the power to intervene where it believes national regulators are failing. But its mandate is limited to taking action against banks \u2013 it cannot prosecute their criminal customers. Neither this week\u2019s 87-page report, produced for Danske by an independent law firm, Bruun and Hjejle, nor a 19-page memorandum by the Danish FSA outlining Danske\u2019s failings in May, have confirmed the names of any of the bank\u2019s suspicious clients. Five years after staff in Estonia began raising the alarm, the only revelations in this area have come from investigative reporters. The Bruun and Hjejle report makes a glancing reference to the most eye-catching name: the Putin family. It confirms that in December 2013, a whistleblower\u2019s account was sent to a member of Danske\u2019s executive board. The whistleblower named a UK registered company with an account at Danske whose beneficial owners were suspected to include \u201cthe Putin family and the FSB\u201d. Bruun and Hjejle referenced reporting by the Danish newspaper Berlingske, which last year named Igor Putin, a businessman and cousin of the Russian president, and a number of his associates, as the individuals suspected by Danske staff of having transacted money through its Estonian accounts. Putin did not respond to a request for comment from Berlingske. The transactions centred on a UK-registered company called Lantana Trade LLP. England\u2019s limited liability partnerships are notoriously popular for money laundering, because the information they are obliged to disclose is minimal. Companies House lists 50,000 active LLPs. Lantana had filed accounts claiming to be dormant, according to the Danish FSA report from May. But Danske staff noticed in the summer of 2012 that it had an extensive history of transactions and a credit balance of nearly $1m. The alarm was raised with managers, but instead of closing the account, they allowed Lantana to remain a client until September 2013. The NCA will not name the company it is investigating. The only detail given is that it is an LLP. In a statement, the agency did acknowledge the role often played by English companies in illegal schemes. \u201cThe threat posed by the use of UK company structures as a route for money laundering is widely recognised and the NCA is working with partners across government to restrict the ability of criminals to use them in this way.\u201d The government says it is considering how to bolster the ability of the Companies House team to check the information provided by entities on its register. But for Keatinge, information gathering is not enough. \u201cWe know that supervision doesn\u2019t get the bad guys,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s investigation that gets the bad guys.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Deliveroo founder Will Shu could be set for a payout of nearly \u00a3150m ($200m), with reports that Uber has been in talks to buy the London-based food delivery service for at least \u00a31.5bn. Uber has said it wants to build scale in the takeaway delivery market as its Uber Eats service battles heavy competition in the US from Grubhub. In the UK, Deliveroo and Uber Eats were set to face increased competition from Just Eat, the takeaway ordering app which has announced plans to launch its own delivery fleet. With millennials three times more likely to \u201corder in\u201d than their parents, there has been a scramble to control a market that is expected to be worth \u00a3279bn by 2030, up from \u00a327bn today, according to analysts at the broker UBS. More than half of takeaways are now ordered online in the UK and that share of the market has been increasing by about 5% a year. Bloomberg reported that the takeover talks, which are said to be at an early stage, might be hindered by Deliveroo mulling whether to retain its independence and push ahead with a potential \u00a31.5bn stock market flotation in the next 18 months. However, Richard Clarke, an analyst at the stockbroker Bernstein, said Uber could potentially offer Shu a more lucrative alternative. Shu is thought to have a stake of at least 9% in Deliveroo and he and his fellow shareholders could be offered more cash than they could raise on the stock market. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a couple of times that private money and the power of synergies can mean the wins can be larger and they can [have] more value,\u201d said Clarke. Bernstein pointed to Coca-Cola\u2019s takeover of Whitbread\u2019s cafe chain Costa Coffee and Pret a Manger\u2019s acquisition by Krispy Kreme owner JAB Holdings after both chains had been considering stock market listings instead. Shu, an American former investment banker, founded Deliveroo in 2013. Deliveroo, which has 15,000 riders in the UK alone, would hand Uber access to a broader array of restaurants and takeaway fans, particularly in European markets such as France and Spain. That would enable it to save costs by delivering more pizzas and burgers per square mile. A merger would also remove one of Uber\u2019s biggest UK competitors from the scene. \u201cThe market is consolidating pretty quickly,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cBuilding scale and improving the density of [delivery] drops is an enormous help to profitability.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The suspension of the deportation of Kweku Adoboli is welcome and hopefully the publicity that his case has attracted will lead to an urgent reappraisal of the policy of deporting so called \u201cforeign criminals\u201d who are not \u201cforeign\u201d but have been here legally since childhood (Banker wins last minute reprieve from deportation, 18 September). It is fortunate for Mr Adoboli that he has so much support, including from his MP, and the services of Jacqueline McKenzie, his lawyer, who wrote about his situation and the issues his case raises (Why does the government want to punish Kweku twice?, Journal, 18 September). The law, which means effectively automatic deportation for non-citizens convicted of crimes for which the penalty is 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, is cruel and inhuman, a form of modern-day transportation. I am aware through some voluntary work I do of a young man who has been returned to Jamaica, which he\u2019d left aged seven. He had been granted indefinite leave to remain in 2003 and would very likely have been have been granted British citizenship if it had been pursued before he was convicted. He had no right of appeal until he had been deported, and legal aid was unavailable. His mother, who worked here for many years, has used her very limited resources to pay legal fees and help him on his arrival in Jamaica, a place with which he had little connection, where he was sent with nothing other than the few personal effects he had in prison.

    "webTitle": "Pound falls on renewed fears of a no-deal Brexit - as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Equity investors on both sides of the Atlantic are in positive mood this afternoon. The FTSE 100 is outperforming all major indices, up 1.6% or 117 points at 7,485. As many of the company\u2019s included in the index have significant earnings abroad, the UK\u2019s leading index tends to benefit from a weaker pound. And the pound is certainly weak today. Early losses driven by a rejection of Theresa May\u2019s Chequers plan by EU leaders were extended when the UK prime minister gave a live statement from Downing Street. Traders took fright when a clearly angered May said Brexit negotiations had reached an \u201cimpasse\u201d, signalling an increased likelihood of a no-deal outcome. The pound is on course for its biggest one-day fall in 2018 against the dollar, down 1.5%. It is down 1.3% against the euro. More reaction to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit statement can be found here: In other, news Bloomberg reported that Uber is in talks to buy online food delivery firm Deliveroo for at least $2bn. The report sent shares in rival Just Eat down more than 4%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. That\u2019s all for today. Thank you for all your comments, and please join us again on Monday. The bell has rung on Wall Street and the Dow Jones has opened at a record high of 26,753. The S&amp;P 500 has also hit a new record high of 2,937. The pound is on course for its biggest one day drop this year against the dollar. Sterling is lower as Theresa May delivers her statement on Brexit. The Prime Minister in defiant tone says Brexit talks have stalled because the EU has rejected the UK\u2019s proposals without offering alternatives. She says the government will continue to work on preparations for a no-deal outcome. The pound is now down 1.2% against the dollar at 1.2% and down 1% against the euro at \u20ac1.1151. The pound\u2019s fortunes have not been helped by the news that Theresa May will make a live announcement from Downing Street at 1.45pm. Sterling is down 0.9% at $1.3153 and 0.7% at \u20ac1.1180. Craig Erlam, an analyst at the currency firm Oanda, says the fall in the pound could be much worse: The pound is paring its gains on Friday after the EU rejected Theresa May\u2019s Chequers proposal, casting doubt on a compromise being found despite the UK being only months from leaving the block. Clearly traders don\u2019t view this as too significant a setback or I would expect the drop off in the currency to be much larger and the rejection hardly comes as a surprise given that officials have publicly criticised the proposal in the past. That said, reports do suggest that EU officials have taken a harder line against May following her insistence that it\u2019s Chequers or no deal. Clearly they believe this is a bluff and haven\u2019t taken to kindly to such a stance so late in the day. May now faces a tough challenge in returning to the UK ahead of the Conservative party conference no closer to a deal than she was before, leaving her with a massive target on her back as certain colleagues look to position themselves as a better alternative. The FTSE 100 is outperforming its main European peers, up 1% at 7,438. But the FTSE\u2019s gain is the pound\u2019s loss. Sterling has lost further ground against both the dollar and the euro. The pound is down 0.6% against the dollar at $1.3183, and down 0.5% against the euro at \u20ac1.1205. Connor Campbell from Spread Ex gives his take: The pound came crashing down from Thursday\u2019s highs as Friday went on, no longer able to ignore Theresa May\u2019s Brexit faceplant in Salzburg. The rather abrupt rejection of the infamous Chequers deal by the EU, alongside a brewing Tory rebellion in the UK, has sterling once again mulling over a potential \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit, with the added seasoning of a potential Conservative leadership challenge at some point down the road. The FTSE, never the pound\u2019s biggest fan and already in a good mood, spring-boarded off these losses to rise more than 80 points, grazing 7450 for the first time since September 5th. Turning to this afternoon and the Dow Jones is set for another record-breaking session. The futures have the index adding 60 odd points after the bell, a move that would see it open above 26,700 for the first time in its long and storied history. Fitch has cut its forecast for global growth in 2019, blaming protectionist US polices and the trade war with China. It now expects the global economy to grow by 3.1% next year, down from its June forecast of 3.2%. So not a huge downgrade, but a downgrade nonetheless. It cut its China growth forecast for 2019 to 6.1% from 6.3%. The ratings agency said it was maintaining its forecast for US growth at 2.6%, despite strong economic data, because of trade tensions. Brian Coulton, Fitch\u2019s chief economist, explains the downgrades: The trade war is now a reality . The recently announced imposition of US tariffs on a further $200 billion of imports from China will have a material impact on global growth and, even though we have now included the 25% tariff shock in our forecast baseline, the downside risks to our global growth forecasts have also increased. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the forecasting group EY Item Club has an alternative view and thinks Philip Hammond might have increase borrowing if he is to fund an NHS spending increase. Public sector borrowing came in at \u00a36.8bn in August, \u00a32.4bn higher than a year earlier. However, over the first five months of the fiscal year, borrowing was still \u00a37.8bn lower than the same period of 2017-18. There will be one, possibly two, more releases before the Office for Budget Responsibility finalises its forecasts for the Budget. Although borrowing continues to run well below 2017-18 levels, the fact that revenue growth is only running in line with its previous forecast and the likely temporary nature of the undershoot in spending means that major changes to the OBR\u2019s projections are looking increasingly unlikely. This means the Chancellor may need to use revenue raising measures, or tolerate higher borrowing, in order to fund the extra spending planned for the NHS. The UK\u2019s deficit was higher than expected in August, but the government is still on track to meet its full year borrowing target of \u00a337bn according to Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics. He explains: Borrowing was higher than expected in August, marking the end of a run of strong figures. Despite the rise in borrowing in August, it is still on track to come in below the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s (OBR\u2019s) forecast over the fiscal year as a whole. We remain content with our forecast for borrowing be \u00a334bn in 2018/19, below the \u00a337bn forecast by the OBR. And we think that the fiscal watchdog is likely to revise its forecast down in November, giving the chancellor room to deliver the promised increase in health expenditure without having to increase taxes or make cuts elsewhere. HSBC has announced it will be taking down its banking app on Sunday morning to carry out \u201cessential maintenance\u201d. Interesting timing... The government borrowed more than expected in August, after disappointing tax receipts, a boost to the state pension, and a contribution to the EU budget. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics showed borrowing was \u00a36.8bn over the month, \u00a32.4bn more than August 2017 and double the \u00a33.4bn forecast by City economists. Not great news for the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who will be thinking about spending options ahead of his autumn budget. The broader picture is better however, with borrowing in the first five months of the fiscal year totalling \u00a317.8bn, \u00a37.8bn less than in the same period in 2017 and the lowest in 16 years. In the latest technical glitch for UK high street banks, NatWest, RBS and Ulster bank customers are unable to access their bank accounts through the app and online this morning. Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk, says: Frustrating times for Natwest customers this morning, especially ahead of the weekend. Banks really need to pull their socks up because this keeps happening again and again. It\u2019s really not good enough when so many customers are being encouraged to bank online. It\u2019s worrying when your bank can\u2019t keep on top of their IT systems \u2013 customers shouldn\u2019t panic though \u2013 Natwest customers can still use telephone banking and they are trying to fix the issues, but if you\u2019re worried about any of your payments being affected speak to Natwest ASAP. The pound is under pressure this morning, hit by renewed fears that Britain will leave the EU without a deal. Sterling is down 0.3% against the dollar at $1.3222, and down 0.3% against the euro at \u20ac1.1225. Here\u2019s the latest on Brexit negotiations. Reports that Uber is in talks to buy Deliveroo have hurt food delivery rival firm Just Eat this morning. Shares in Just Eat are down 5.8%, making it the second biggest faller on the FTSE 100 (after Smiths Group). Trading is underway in Europe and all major markets are up, following those record closes on Wall Street on Thursday. FTSE 100: +0.8% at 7,424 Germany\u2019s DAX: +0.7% at 12,407 France\u2019s CAC: +0.3% at 5,469 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: +0.7% at 21,531 Spain\u2019s IBEX: +0.3% at 9,616 Europe\u2019s STOXX 600: +0.3% at 384 NatWest is the latest bank to have problems with its online and mobile banking services. The bank says this morning that it is \u201cworking hard\u201d to fix the issues after customers complained. On Thursday, millions of Barclays customers were unable to access their accounts online for several hours after the high street lender to suffered a technical glitch. And last but not least, TSB is still recovering from a botched IT upgrade in April that left up to 1.9 million digital customers locked out of accounts. The ride-hailing service Uber is in early stage talks to buy the food delivery firm Deliveroo, according to a report by Bloomberg. Deliveroo competes with Uber Eats, Uber\u2019s food delivery business. The news agency writes: A bid for London-based Deliveroo, last valued at more than $2 billion, would mark a major attempt by Uber to dominate the food-delivery business in Europe. An acquisition price is unknown. Any offer would need to be considerably above its latest valuation, according to people with direct knowledge of Deliveroo plans. The talks could fall apart, in part because Deliveroo and its investors have been reluctant to relinquish independence, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Spokesmen at Deliveroo and Uber declined to comment. Uber Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi has made the company\u2019s food-delivery business a top priority ahead of a planned initial public offering in the second half of 2019. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Asian markets have followed Wall Street higher today, as investor fears over a full-blown trade war between China and the US subsided. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 0.6% to hit an eight-month high, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong was up 1.3%. It followed a record high close for both the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 on Thursday, as investors focus on positive company earnings and concerns ease over trade tensions. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets explains: The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 hit all-time highs yesterday as fears surrounding the US-China trade standoff subsided. The tariffs that were announced by both sides during the week were deemed to be not as harsh as originally suspected. The US in particular showed restraint, but that was partially so the Trump administration would have more ammunition should they feel it is required down the line. Now that the latest series of tariffs are out of the way, investors fell back into their bullish routine. Stock markets in Asia overnight were dragged higher by the positive move on Wall Street. Markets in Europe are also expected to open higher: In other news, Bloomberg is reporting that Uber is in early stage talks to buy Deliveroo, the food delivery service, for several billion dollars. More on that soon. Also coming up... At 9.30am BST we get UK figures for public sector finances in August.",

      "bodyText": "Idris Elba is the latest celebrity planning to open a luxury bar for his actor pals to hang out in alongside wealthy drinkers. When Elba\u2019s bar, the Parrot, opens at the Waldorf Hilton hotel on Aldwych next month it will be the first London bar to offer its clientele a ride to and from the venue in a chauffeur-driven Aston Martin. It is also promising \u201ca whole host of A-list surprises\u201d alongside the martinis and mojitos. Elba, 46, who played Nelson Mandela in Long Walk to Freedom and the drug kingpin Russell \u201cStringer\u201d Bell in The Wire, will sometimes be mixing drinks himself from the bar\u2019s \u201chidden cocktail menu\u201d, as well as occasionally taking to the decks. Elba has DJed since he was 14, performing under the name DJ Driis, but has said he has struggled to be appreciated for his mixing skills because of his fame as an actor. \u201cIt was difficult to sort of be taken seriously in this arena because of my acting, for sure,\u201d he said in an interview with the dance music magazine Dancing Astronaut. London has been establishing itself on the global cocktail map, with its venues collecting seven out 14 awards at the Spirited awards in New Orleans this summer. The American Bar at the Savoy hotel was crowned the world\u2019s best bar, Happiness Forgets in Hoxton Square won the best international cocktail bar category and the low-key Coupette, in Bethnal Green, was best newcomer. A David Bowie-themed bar, Ziggy\u2019s, opened in the Hotel Cafe Royal by Piccadilly Circus this week. In 1973 Bowie threw a party at the hotel to say farewell to his alter ego, inviting artists such as Lou Reed, Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney and Barbra Streisand to celebrate. The new bar is decorated with photos of that party taken by Bowie\u2019s official photographer, Mick Rock. Elba\u2019s Parrot intends to cash in on his connections, promising an \u201carray of completely unannounced secret shows from the stars of stage and screen\u201d. However, other celebrity-owned bars across the UK have been forced to close their doors after failing to attract enough punters. Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs\u2019s Manchester bar Mahiki closed in the summer, less than a year after it opened. It averaged a two-out-of-five-star rating on TripAdvisor, with some guests describing it as \u201cdisappointing\u201d and tasteless. The bar charged \u00a310 entry and cocktails cost from \u00a312 to \u00a3140 for a \u201ctreasure chest sharer\u201d. The model and television presenter Kelly Brook closed her bar, Steam &amp; Rye, in central London last summer after it failed to make enough money. Celebrity bars are having a bit more success in the US. Jay-Z\u2019s 40/40 sport club has expanded from its original venue in Chelsea, New York, to Brooklyn and Atlanta airport. However, his venues in Las Vegas and Atlantic City both closed down. Susan Sarandon owns a chain of table tennis-themed bars called SPiN, which has expanded to eight cities across the US and Canada. Channing Tatum owns Saints &amp; Sinners, a cocktail bar in New Orleans. The Scrubs actor Zach Braff is the part-owner of Mermaid Oyster Bar, which has expanded to three venues in New York. Elba\u2019s bar will be run in partnership with twins Lee and Nicky Caulfield. Lee, a former agent in Hollywood, describes himself as the \u201cgo-to guy\u201d for celebrities, \u201carranging restaurants, nightlife, entertainment and holidays for some of the most globally recognised individuals\u201d. Nicky describes himself as a self-taught drummer. The brothers also run an alcoholic ice cream company.",

The new bar is decorated with photos of that party taken by Bowie\u2019s official photographer, Mick Rock.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ada6e0154183fba832cdc0a78dd4c1739c272351\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ada6e0154183fba832cdc0a78dd4c1739c272351/26_204_2955_1774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actor and DJ Idris Elba performs live on the Sonic stage during the second day of the Glastonbury Festival in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Idris Elba has DJed since he was 14, performing under the name DJ Driis, and will occasionally take to the decks at his bar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elba\u2019s Parrot intends to cash in on his connections, promising an \u201carray of completely unannounced secret shows from the stars of stage and screen\u201d.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A judge has branded the former BHS owner Dominic Chappell \u201cevasive\u201d and \u201centirely unbelievable\u201d as his appeal against his failure to hand over vital documents to the pensions watchdog was rejected on Friday. Chappell, 51, showed no emotion as a judge dismissed his claims that he had \u201cdone everything in his powers\u201d to help provide the information. The entrepreneur, as he describes himself, was convicted of failing to hand over documents to the Pensions Regulator (TPR) and ordered to pay a \u00a350,000 fine and \u00a337,000 court costs. Chappell, who had no retail experience, bought BHS from the billionaire Sir Philip Green for only \u00a31 in March 2015. The company crashed in April 2016 with the loss of 11,000 jobs, leaving a pensions black hole of more than \u00a3500m. TPR, which has a responsibility to safeguard pensions, immediately moved to protect the pensions of 19,000 members and made three requests for information under section 72. When Chappell failed to comply he was charged with three counts of neglecting or refusing to provide documents contrary to the Pensions Act 2004 and, after a trial in January, he was found guilty and fined. Judge Christine Henson QC, in rejecting his appeal against the decision, said evidence put forward by Chappell was \u201cuntrue\u201d and not \u201cat all credible\u201d. She said the former BHS owner had also been \u201cevasive about his business dealings\u201d and had avoided answering questions. Henson said: \u201cWe found his evidence entirely unbelievable on what he described as his inability to access any of the relevant documents and information.\u201d During the appeal against the conviction at Hove crown court, Chappell claimed the demands for thousands of documents by the regulator were unreasonable as he was struggling under an immense workload. He told the court: \u201cI was drowning in paperwork and dealing with five other government departments and two sets of administrators, and 11,500 people were employed by me. I had some major challenges.\u201d Chappell, who lives in Blandford Forum, Dorset, said he went \u201cabove and beyond\u201d in his efforts to help provide details of the section 72s to TPR. He also complained he had been locked out of the BHS offices and had no access to the documents. Alex Stein, speaking on behalf of TPR, compared Chappell with a character from The Wizard of Oz, saying he had put on a \u201cspectacular show\u201d but what emerged from behind the curtain was a \u201crather pathetic and dishonest figure.\u201d Henson ruled: \u201cIn giving evidence before us, Mr Chappell consistently tried to avoid answering the question asked by giving answers to something quite different as well as being evasive about his business dealings. \u201cWe have concluded that the majority of answers given by the appellant were not credible. He had not provided any reliable evidence to support any of the reasons he says provide him with a reasonable excuse.\u201d Michael Levy, for Chappell, said bankruptcy was \u201clooming\u201d again for the three-times bankrupt former owner of BHS. Henson adjourned the resentencing until Chappell was able to submit details of his income and financial circumstances. Chappell said he would be appealing against the judgment and added he could not comment further until after sentencing. A TPR spokesman said: \u201cWe are pleased that the court has confirmed that Dominic Chappell was wrong when he failed to provide us with information we required as part of our BHS investigation.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Money for nothing? Dire Straits back-catalogue investment venture launched", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "First it was David Bowie selling his own \u201cBowie bonds\u201d, and now fans of Dire Straits are being given the chance to invest in the band\u2019s multimillion-selling back catalogue. A new investment scheme has been launched that allows individuals, hedge funds and others to buy a share of the royalties that are paid out every time one of the British rock band\u2019s songs or albums is bought, downloaded, streamed or played on the radio. The venture, from Royalty Exchange, a US-based company specialising in buying and selling royalties, confirms what Bowie and others realised some time ago: classic songs are not only the soundtrack to people\u2019s lives \u2013 they are also a potentially lucrative \u201casset class\u201d that can be packaged up and sold off to wealthy investors \u2013 however much that idea might horrify fans. The portfolio includes the band\u2019s biggest hit Money for Nothing, which famously addressed the topic of rock stars earning millions of pounds by seemingly doing little more than playing the guitar or bashing a drum kit. However, only those with deep pockets need apply. To be eligible for the scheme, investors must have more than $1m (\u00a3760,000) of investable assets aside from their main home or an annual income of $200,000-plus, or a joint income of $300,000-plus. Dire Straits\u2019 heyday was the 1980s and the band split in 1995 but, according to Royalty Exchange, their back catalogue\u2019s earnings \u201care not only still growing but are outperforming the growth of the broader music industry\u201d. Much of that growth is down to the boom in music streaming, which has introduced heritage rock acts to new generations and prompted many older music fans to revisit the bands of their youth. The company said the portion of the Dire Straits back catalogue available for sale earned $296,000 (\u00a3225,000) in the past 12 months but had earned royalties since 1978, and added that while the music industry grew 14% from 2015 to 2017, \u201cthe Dire Straits catalogue earnings grew 60% in that same timeframe\u201d. The investment offer has come about because Dire Straits\u2019 longtime former manager Ed Bicknell is selling off his share of the sound recording royalties generated by the band\u2019s entire back catalogue, together with solo releases from the band members Mark Knopfler and John Illsley. That includes all six studio albums, including Brothers in Arms, the eighth best-selling album of all time in the UK, plus hits such as Sultans of Swing and Walk of Life, along with music videos, live albums and any existing or future best-of compilations. Royalty Exchange said music royalties were \u201cundervalued\u201d and that the older \u201cclassic rock\u201d bands were of particular interest to investors. It said it expected the Dire Straits catalogue to produce a cash yield of 8% in the first year and added that it was forecasting a 12-15% annualised rate of return over 10 years. Asked about the potential hazards, a spokesman said: \u201cAll investments have risk.\u201d Knopfler, the band\u2019s lead singer and guitarist, is not involved in the investment scheme, although \u201che is aware of it\u201d, the company said. Some may wonder about the potential returns that might be generated by Dire Straits royalties, bearing in mind that for some people they are a band inextricably linked to the 80s and the yuppie generation, and that, unlike many of their peers, they are no longer in existence. The ChartMasters website noted earlier this year that while Brothers in Arms was the highest-selling rock album during the 1980s, \u201cit is losing ground, since Bon Jovi\u2019s Slippery When Wet, U2\u2019s The Joshua Tree, Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Born In the USA and Guns N\u2019Roses\u2019 Appetite for Destruction are now all ahead of it, with total sales ranging from 46m to 50m\u201d. Meanwhile, Money for Nothing \u2013 a US number one in 1985 \u2013 has in recent years run into censorship issues over its controversial lyrics, which could potentially limit airplay. Lines in the song include \u201cSee the little faggot with the earring and the makeup \u2026 That little faggot got his own jet airplane\u201d, \u201cMoney for nothin\u2019 and chicks for free\u201d and \u201cBangin\u2019 on the bongos like a chimpanzee\u201d. In a 1985 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Knopfler was quoted as saying: \u201cThe singer in Money for Nothing is a real ignoramus, hard hat mentality \u2013 somebody who sees everything in financial terms. I mean, this guy has a grudging respect for rock stars. He sees it in terms of, well, that\u2019s not working and yet the guy\u2019s rich: that\u2019s a good scam.\u201d Investors from outside the US are able to participate in the new scheme, which is technically a \u201cprivate syndicate\u201d. Investors participate by buying units in a specially created limited liability company (LLC) that holds the royalties. Unit holders are then entitled to their proportional share of income generated by the LLC. It remains to be seen whether Dire Straits fans will gain more access to the investments than Bowie fans did. In 1997, David Bowie raised $55m by creating so-called \u201cBowie bonds\u201d, through which investors would receive a share of the royalties from 287 of his songs over the next 10 years. However, the bonds \u2013 which paid a 7.9% rate of interest \u2013 were all snapped up by the Prudential Insurance Company. From chocolate to tennis: other investment schemes \u2022 Hotel Chocolat launched \u201cchocolate bonds\u201d in 2010, where customers who invested \u00a32,000 received six boxes of chocolates each year rather than the cash interest. The chocolate boxes were priced at \u00a318.95, so the \u201cpayout\u201d was equal to 5.6% interest a year. \u2022 A community share scheme raised \u00a3600,000 from 3,000 investors to help restore Hastings Pier after a disastrous fire in 2010. However, despite winning the Stirling prize in 2013, the pier went into administration in 2017 and was sold to a private buyer, Sheikh Abid Gulzar, making the community shares worthless. \u2022 Wimbledon debentures give the owners not only a premier ticket for the tennis on No 1 Court but also access to lounges, restaurants and bars not open to the public. The last round were priced at \u00a331,000 each \u2013 but many buyers make the money back by selling on some of their tickets.",

Much of that growth is down to the boom in music streaming, which has introduced heritage rock acts to new generations and prompted many older music fans to revisit the bands of their youth.</p> <p>The company said the portion of the Dire Straits back catalogue available for sale earned $296,000 (\u00a3225,000) in the past 12 months but had earned royalties since 1978, and added that while the music industry grew 14% from 2015 to 2017, \u201cthe Dire Straits catalogue earnings grew 60% in that same timeframe\u201d.</p> <p>The investment offer has come about because Dire Straits\u2019 longtime former manager Ed Bicknell is selling off his share of the sound recording royalties generated by the band\u2019s entire back catalogue, together with solo releases from the band members Mark Knopfler and John Illsley. That includes all six studio albums, including Brothers in Arms, the eighth best-selling album of all time in the UK, plus hits such as Sultans of Swing and Walk of Life, along with music videos, live albums and any existing or future best-of compilations.</p> <p>Royalty Exchange said music royalties were \u201cundervalued\u201d and that the older \u201cclassic rock\u201d bands were of particular interest to investors. It said it expected the Dire Straits catalogue to produce a cash yield of 8% in the first year and added that it was forecasting a 12-15% annualised rate of return over 10 years. Asked about the potential hazards, a spokesman said: \u201cAll investments have risk.\u201d</p> <p>Knopfler, the band\u2019s lead singer and guitarist, is not involved in the investment scheme, although \u201che is aware of it\u201d, the company said.</p> <p>Some may wonder about the potential returns that might be generated by Dire Straits royalties, bearing in mind that for some people they are a band inextricably linked to the 80s and the yuppie generation, and that, unlike many of their peers, they are no longer in existence. The ChartMasters website <a href=\"https://chartmasters.org/2018/03/cspc-dire-straits-popularity-analysis/25/\">noted earlier this year</a> that while Brothers in Arms was the highest-selling rock album during the 1980s, \u201cit is losing ground, since Bon Jovi\u2019s Slippery When Wet, U2\u2019s The Joshua Tree, Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Born In the USA and Guns N\u2019Roses\u2019 Appetite for Destruction are now all ahead of it, with total sales ranging from 46m to 50m\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Money for Nothing \u2013 a US number one in 1985 \u2013 has in recent years <a href=\"https://vancouversun.com/news/community-blogs/money-for-nothing-and-your-chicks-for-free-another-loss-for-context-and-subtlety\">run into censorship issues</a> over its controversial <a href=\"https://genius.com/Dire-straits-money-for-nothing-lyrics\">lyrics</a>, which could potentially limit airplay. Lines in the song include \u201cSee the little faggot with the earring and the makeup \u2026 That little faggot got his own jet airplane\u201d, \u201cMoney for nothin\u2019 and chicks for free\u201d and \u201cBangin\u2019 on the bongos like a chimpanzee\u201d. In a 1985 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Knopfler was quoted as saying: \u201cThe singer in Money for Nothing is a real ignoramus, hard hat mentality \u2013 somebody who sees everything in financial terms. I mean, this guy has a grudging respect for rock stars. He sees it in terms of, well, that\u2019s not working and yet the guy\u2019s rich: that\u2019s a good scam.\u201d</p> <p>Investors from outside the US are able to participate in the new scheme, which is technically a \u201cprivate syndicate\u201d. Investors participate by buying units in a specially created limited liability company (LLC) that holds the royalties. Unit holders are then entitled to their proportional share of income generated by the LLC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\u00a0Business\u00a0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>It remains to be seen whether Dire Straits fans will gain more access to the investments than Bowie fans did.

However, the bonds \u2013 which paid a 7.9% rate of interest \u2013 were all snapped up by the Prudential Insurance Company.</p> <h2>From chocolate to tennis: other investment schemes</h2> <p>\u2022 Hotel Chocolat launched \u201cchocolate bonds\u201d in 2010, where customers who invested \u00a32,000 received six boxes of chocolates each year rather than the cash interest.

      "bodyText": "The Church of England has pulled out of an attempt to buy the loan book of the collapsed payday lender Wonga following a week of talks led by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, aimed at protecting the interests of vulnerable borrowers. The move creates fresh uncertainty for around 200,000 borrowers who could now be forced to pay back their debts at high rates by a commercial lending firm. Welby said on Friday that the C of E commissioners, who control an \u00a38.3bn investment portfolio, had decided not to participate in any buyout, but the potential investors he has been in talks with are now expected to make a bid for the estimated \u00a3400m loan book. Welby has been engaged all week in a round of meetings and phonecalls with unidentified financial investors and charitable foundations in a bid to put together a consortium that could have ultimately resulted in the creation of an ethical payday lender. The church said in a statement: \u201cThe church understands that confidential approaches may now be made by those interested parties to the administrators of Wonga\u2019s UK loan book. The Church of England will not be party to continuing discussions given their commercially sensitive nature.\u201d The archbishop was reportedly enthusiastic about the church helping buy the loan book as he has repeatedly clashed with Wonga, which charged borrowers interest rates as high as 5,853% per annum before rates were capped by ministers in 2015 and now stand at about 1,500%. In 2013 he told the company\u2019s chief executive he wanted to put it out of business by supporting rival community lending schemes. He told the TUC conference last week: \u201cI said to the chief executive of Wonga that I wanted credit unions to compete him out of business. Well, he\u2019s gone!\u201d The church commissioners are understood to have argued that they did not have the expertise to properly value the distressed loan book and they were concerned that the need to write off certain loans could be legally problematical given its status as an entity set up to benefit of the church. \u201cMy chief concern has been to ensure that the poor and vulnerable are as well protected as possible following the collapse of Wonga\u2019s UK business,\u201d Welby said. \u201cI fully support and respect the decision of the church commissioners not to participate in a potential buy out. They have given this option close attention and I thank them for their time, advice and consideration.\u201d He continued: \u201cI will be continuing to examine ways to make affordable credit, debt advice and support more widely available and convening interested parties at Lambeth Palace. If we make the economy fairer for all, we will also make it stronger. When prosperity and justice go hand in hand, every part of society benefits.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK government deficit widened unexpectedly in August, handing Philip Hammond disappointing news ahead of the autumn budget. Public sector net borrowing last month, excluding the nationalised banks, grew by \u00a32.4bn to \u00a36.8bn compared with August a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. City economists expected the deficit, which is the gap between government spending and tax receipts, to improve by about \u00a31bn. The figures showed slower-than-forecast growth in tax income of 1.6% compared with a year ago, exacerbated by an increase in spending across government departments of 5.4%. The latest snapshot for the health of the public finances comes against a backdrop of steady improvements in recent months helped by relative economic stability, which has driven down the deficit over the course of the 2018-19 financial year to the lowest level for 16 years. Borrowing in the current financial year-to-date now stands at \u00a317.8bn, almost a third lower than the same period a year ago, and on-track to undershoot the target of \u00a337bn for the fiscal year set by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government tax and spending watchdog. Despite the improving picture over the course of the year, the latest figures will likely frustrate the chancellor as he prepares for the autumn budget while considering ways to pay for the \u00a320bn annual increase in NHS spending due by 2023-24 which was promised by Theresa May earlier this year. The task is complicated by Hammond\u2019s refusal to divert from the Conservatives\u2019 plan to eliminate the deficit by the middle of the next decade, in order to record the first surplus for the public finances since the turn of the millennium in 2001-2. Economists, however, argue that the chancellor still has wiggle room because he also set a more short-term target of reducing the deficit to below 2% of national income by 2021 \u2013 a metric the OBR forecasts he will be able to achieve this financial year. There are growing calls for Hammond to loosen the purse strings, including from MPs in his own party, after almost a decade of austerity first imposed by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition in 2010. The chancellor is however understood to fear the impact a no-deal Brexit could have on the public finances, meaning he may choose to hold on to the spending headroom built-up this year until after Britain leaves the EU. Hammond is yet to reveal the date of the budget, despite speculation it could come as early as next month, amid growing concern over the government\u2019s ability to reach a Brexit deal with Brussels. \u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 24 September 2018 to clarify that the government\u2019s NHS pledge is to raise annual spending by \u00a320bn by 2023-24.",

The higher the debt, the more interest the government must pay, potentially cutting funds available for public spending.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The latest snapshot for the health of the public finances comes against a backdrop of steady improvements in recent months helped by relative economic stability, which has driven down the deficit over the course of the 2018-19 financial year to the lowest level for 16 years.</p> \n<p>Borrowing in the current financial year-to-date now stands at \u00a317.8bn, almost a third lower than the same period a year ago, and on-track to undershoot the target of \u00a337bn for the fiscal year set by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/office-for-budget-responsibility\">Office for Budget Responsibility</a>, the government tax and spending watchdog.</p> \n<p>Despite the improving picture over the course of the year, the latest figures will likely frustrate the chancellor as he prepares for the autumn budget while considering ways to pay for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/18/theresa-may-ready-ditch-tax-pledges-pay-nhs-funding-plans\">\u00a320bn annual increase in NHS spending due by 2023-24</a> which was promised by Theresa May earlier this year.</p> \n<p>The task is complicated by Hammond\u2019s refusal to divert from the Conservatives\u2019 plan to eliminate the deficit by the middle of the next decade, in order to record the first surplus for the public finances since the turn of the millennium in 2001-2.</p> \n<p>Economists, however, argue that the chancellor still has wiggle room because he also set a more short-term target of reducing the deficit to below 2% of national income by 2021 \u2013 a metric the OBR forecasts he will be able to achieve this financial year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are growing calls for Hammond to loosen the purse strings, including from MPs in his own party, after almost a decade of austerity first imposed by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition in 2010.</p> \n<p>The chancellor is however understood to fear the impact a no-deal Brexit could have on the public finances, meaning he may choose to hold on to the spending headroom built-up this year until after Britain leaves the EU.</p> \n<p>Hammond is yet to reveal the date of the budget, despite <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=budget+october+times&amp;oq=budget+october+times&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3495j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">speculation it could come as early as next month</a>, amid growing concern over the government\u2019s ability to reach a Brexit deal with Brussels.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The subheading of this article was amended on 24 September 2018 to clarify that the government\u2019s NHS pledge is to raise annual spending by \u00a320bn by 2023-24.</p>",
