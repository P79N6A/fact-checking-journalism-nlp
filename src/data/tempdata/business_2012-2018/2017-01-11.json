      "bodyText": "Six former Volkswagen executives are being charged over their alleged roles in the 2015 emissions scandal, as the company admits liability and is ordered to pay a record $4.3bn (\u00a33.5bn) penalty, US officials have said. The men are accused of running a near decade-long conspiracy during their time at the firm and are being charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, violations of the Clean Air Act, and wire fraud, the US attorney general Loretta Lynch said on Wednesday. \u201cThese individuals all held positions of significant responsibility at VW, including overseeing the company\u2019s engine development division and serving on the company\u2019s management board,\u201d she said, adding that they had \u201cseriously abused those positions\u201d. Separately, Lynch said Volkswagen had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the US, to commit wire fraud and to violate the American pollution laws. It also admitted obstruction of justice and \u201cimportation of goods by false statements\u201d. Consequently, the firm has been told to pay a $2.8bn criminal fine and a further $1.5bn in a civil settlement, Lynch announced. Volkswagen will also spend three years on probation and an independent monitor will be sent in to \u201coversee its ethics and compliance program\u201d. The penalty against the company is the largest ever levied by the US government against an automaker, eclipsing the $1.2bn fine against Toyota in 2014 over safety issues related to unintended acceleration. Last month, it was reported that Volkswagen had already agreed to pay $17.5bn in the US to resolve claims from car owners, as well as regulators. The settlements and penalties emanate from Volkswagen\u2019s admission in September 2015 that it had installed secret software in vehicles to make them appear cleaner in emissions tests than they actually were. Some, it emerged, were emitting up to 40 times the legally allowable pollution levels. Announcing the indictments and plea deal on Wednesday, the US justice department detailed an elaborate and wide-ranging scheme to commit fraud and then cover it up. At least 40 VW employees were involved in destroying evidence, the government said. It is alleged that, in one case, an assistant was asked to find and throw away a hard drive on which emails between two supervisors were stored. The six executives charged were: Richard Dorenkamp; Bernd Gottweis; Jens Hadler; Heinz-Jakob Neusser; J\u00fcrgen Peter; and Oliver Schmidt. According to the plea agreement, the executives and other employees agreed to deceive the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators about diesel emissions starting in May 2006, when they realised the engines would not meet emissions standards that were going into effect the following year. Under the direction of executives, Volkswagen employees designed engines with \u201cdefeat device\u201d software that would reduce emissions only when the vehicle was undergoing a standard US emissions test. They borrowed the idea from the firm\u2019s luxury division, Audi, which was developing different engines with similar software. In November 2006, some employees raised objections to the defeat device to the head of VW brand engine development. That official directed the employees to continue and warned them \u201cnot to get caught\u201d. In August 2015, a Volkswagen employee ignored instructions from bosses and told US regulators about the \u201cdefeat devices\u201d. A supervisor confirmed their existence the following month.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Bank of England looks set to upgrade its forecasts for the UK economy after admitting that some of the risks posed by the Brexit vote last June have now receded. Giving evidence to the Treasury select committee, governor Mark Carney said the Bank\u2019s actions to avoid a market meltdown after the referendum were a key reason why Threadneedle Street might be raising its forecasts for a second time. Carney also said the government needed to agree a transition deal for quitting the EU and insisted that Brexit posed a greater risk to the remaining members of the EU than the UK. The Bank will publish its latest report on the economy next month and will take on board the stronger than expected performance in the second half of 2016. \u201cI would say, and I\u2019ll say this very lightly, which is that recent data would be consistent with some further upgrade of the forecast but that process has not yet started,\u201d said Carney. In November, the Bank raised its growth forecast from 2% to 2.2% for 2016 and from 0.8% to 1.4% for 2017. Carney said the Bank had helped to \u201cmake the weather\u201d through its emergency actions to boost growth taken in six weeks after the referendum. His testimony coincided with another strong performance by the UK\u2019s leading stock-market quoted companies, with the FTSE 100 closing at a record high for a tenth successive day. Share prices for companies which are dependent on their US dollar earnings have been boosted by the continued weakness of the pound, which on Wednesday hit a near 32-year-low against the American currency of just over $1.20. Carney was quizzed by MPs about the forecasting record of the Bank following remarks last week by Threadneedle Street\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, in which he described the collapse of Lehman Brothers as the economics profession\u2019s \u201cMichael Fish moment\u201d \u2013 the UK weather forecaster who in 1987 failed to predict a gigantic storm coming. The governor said the Bank\u2019s overly-pessimistic forecast for the economy in the immediate wake of the Brexit vote was less serious than its failure to spot the financial crisis of 2007-08. \u201cThis is about the near-term strength of the economy which is absolutely welcome,\u201d the governor said. \u201cMissing the financial crisis is a big deal ... a different order of magnitude.\u201d Carney defended the Bank, saying it had helped the UK through the potentially difficult post-referendum period in two ways: by cutting interest rates and by ensuring the banking system was \u201crock solid\u201d. While admitting that Brexit still posed financial stability risks, Carney said the other 27 members of the EU now faced a bigger threat than the UK. \u201cI\u2019m not saying there are not financial stability risks to the UK ... but there are greater financial stability risks on the continent in the short term, for the transition, than there are for the UK.\u201d Carney said other EU nations relied heavily on the City for their financial needs and could face major problems if international banks based in London are no longer able to gain easy access to European countries and corporations. \u201cIf you rely on a jurisdiction for three-quarters of your hedging activities, three-quarters of your foreign exchange activity, half your lending and half your securities transactions you should think very carefully about the transition from where you are today to where the new equilibrium will be.\u201d Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said the governor had given advice to both the government and the EU about the need for transition arrangements. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also told the UK\u2019s negotiating counterparts in the EU that they, more than the UK, are vulnerable to financial stability risks during the period of transition. I hope they are all listening,\u201d said Tyrie. Carney agreed with the analogy made earlier this week by HSBC bank chief Douglas Flint that the risk posed by Brexit to the financial markets was like a Jenga tower in which it was difficult to know which pieces could be removed without endangering the structure. \u201cI think it\u2019s a decent analogy. I think just like when you play Jenga and you start early on, there are some pretty obvious pieces you can take out without imperilling the tower,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point, losing elements of that has outsized \u2013 could have outsized \u2013 effects, and these are some of the judgements that the government will have to make,\u201d he added.",

I hope they are all listening,\u201d said Tyrie.</p> <p>Carney agreed with the analogy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/10/hard-brexit-threatens-global-financial-system-city-chiefs-tell-mps\">made earlier this week by HSBC bank chief Douglas Flint that the risk posed by Brexit to the financial markets was like a Jenga tower</a> in which it was difficult to know which pieces could be removed without endangering the structure.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a decent analogy. I think just like when you play Jenga and you start early on, there are some pretty obvious pieces you can take out without imperilling the tower,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAt some point, losing elements of that has outsized \u2013 could have outsized \u2013 effects, and these are some of the judgements that the government will have to make,\u201d he added. </p>",

Please, one of you, use next week\u2019s forum to point out the absurdity of Davos. Profit woes expose how far Foxtons has fallen A traditional view of Foxtons says the London-focused estate agent is utterly charmless, but the brilliance of its hard-charging, high-fee business model should be acknowledged. Perhaps it is time to revisit this thesis \u2013 not the charmless part, naturally, but the idea that Foxtons is as slick as supposed. The latest profit warning on Wednesday revealed how far Foxtons has fallen in these \u201csubdued\u201d times for the London property market. Top-line profits for 2016 are forecast to be \u00a325m on revenues of \u00a3133m. A profit margin of 18.8% doesn\u2019t sound too painful but consider Foxtons\u2019 recent history. Between 2010 and 2016, it converted at least 30p in every pound of revenue into profit. The highest profit margin was 35.7% (2013) and the lowest was 30.7% (2015). In that context, a fall to 18.8% counts as a spectacular end to more than half a decade of stability. That\u2019s just how life goes sometimes, say Foxtons loyalists. In the jargon, the business is merely operationally geared \u2013 it has slow periods, as now, but coins it when the London market revs up. As long as the company doesn\u2019t take on silly levels of debt (a lesson learned the hard way by one-time private equity owner BC Partners), it\u2019s just a question of waiting. In the meantime, there\u2019s a tidy living to be made from reliable lettings, now half the business. Well, maybe. But Foxtons has 50% more branches than it did at flotation in 2013 (65 v 42) yet revenues were lower in 2016 than then (\u00a3133m v \u00a3139m). Can that all be explained by normal market volatility? Or is Foxtons also having to travel further into outer London to find house sellers willing to pay its \u201cpremium\u201d \u2013 call it princely \u2013 commission rate on sales of 2.5%? Are cut-price agents like Purplebricks, charging substantially lower fees on a flat structure, changing sellers\u2019 perceptions of a fair commission? For now, Foxtons, even as its shares hit 96p, against a float price of 230p, seems unflustered and confident that its profit margins will recover one day. Maybe it will be proved right. But the supermarkets were also confident until discounters Aldi and Lidl showed that the game had changed. Argos deal gives Sainsbury\u2019s reasons to be cheerful Christmas at Sainsbury\u2019s was a comfortable snore. Like-for-like sales in the supermarkets advanced at the mighty rate of 0.1% in the quarter and like-for-like volumes were dead flat. One is obliged to say this performance was marginally better than the City had expected \u2013 and better than Sainsbury\u2019s had achieved in recent quarters \u2013 but the real interest was in newly acquired Argos. That was lively: like-for-like sales up 4%. It\u2019s still early days \u2013 and profit figures are awaited \u2013 but it\u2019s probably time to concede that the Argos purchase is looking like a smart piece of business. Selling food has become hard graft, and progress may continue to be measured in fractions of percentage points for some time yet. Argos, on the other hand, offers the chance of a fizz of excitement as Sainsbury\u2019s opens stores-within-stores and cross-sells between two sets of customers. There are risks in merging two big supply chains and securing the promised cost-savings from closing redundant Argos high-street outlets \u2013 but there were also risks in doing nothing in the age of Amazon.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The pound has fallen to a fresh 10-week low against the dollar as Brexit fears and the prospect of a Donald Trump bounce for the US economy gripped the markets. For the first time since 25 October, sterling fell to almost $1.20 before it mounted a recovery after figures showed the UK\u2019s industrial sector returned to health in November. Strong figures from Britain\u2019s supermarkets and a boost for mining company profits pushed the FTSE 100 to a 12th consecutive day of rises, making it the index\u2019s longest winning streak on record. Currency traders said the US president-elect was still the biggest influence on the dollar following several hints that he would support a spending splurge when he takes office to boost manufacturing and infrastructure investment. The dollar has surged since his election in November backed by strong US employment and manufacturing figures. The UK industrial sector, which had a difficult autumn, returned to health in November after manufacturing output rose more than expected and the North Sea\u2019s biggest oilfield resumed production following a temporary closure. But the weak pound drove up the cost of imports and left Britain with a record trade deficit with the EU, months before the government triggers article 50 to begin the process of leaving the bloc. The rise in manufacturing production and more buoyant energy sector failed to mark a recovery from poor figures for October and September, and push the broader measure of industrial output into positive territory over a three-month period. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) monthly estimate of manufacturing increased by 1.3% in November, with industrial production pushing ahead by 2.1%. The largest contribution came from pharmaceutical companies, which increased output by 11.4%. Overall, UK economic growth in the fourth quarter edged slightly lower to 0.5%, from 0.6% in the third, according to new figures from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr). The first official estimate of growth in the fourth quarter and 2016 will be published on 26 January by the ONS. The growth in industrial production was also driven by an 8.2% month-on-month increase in mining and quarrying output. The construction sector, which has been badly affected by Brexit uncertainty, slipped back by 0.2% following falls in repair work and commercial building. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the effect of the rise in industrial production would not be enough to push up GDP in the fourth quarter of 2016. \u201cIndustrial production will be lower in the fourth quarter as a whole than in the third, despite November\u2019s surge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think production likely fell in December, despite the improvement in manufacturing surveys at the tail end of 2016, because unusually warm temperatures in December likely depressed output in the energy supply sector. \u201cAs a result, industrial production likely fell for the second consecutive quarter in the fourth quarter \u2013 technically marking a recession for the sector \u2013 leaving the services sector as the sole locomotive of growth at the end of last year.\u201d Separate trade figures showed the overall goods and services deficit \u2013 the gap between exports and imports \u2013 was \u00a32.6bn larger than in October. They reflected a \u00a33.3bn rise in imports, while Britain recorded an additional \u00a3700m of exports. The ONS said: \u201cThe widening of the deficit in November 2016 is attributed to trade in goods in which there were increased imports from both EU and non-EU countries, partially offset by an increase in exports to EU countries.\u201d The monthly deficit with the EU reached a record \u00a38.6bn, up from \u00a37.8bn in October, as imports of transport equipment, chemicals and portable computers outweighed rising exports. Niesr estimates the UK economy grew at the weakest rate in three years in 2016. Annual growth slowed to 2% last year from 2.2% in 2015, the weakest rate since 2013, when the economy grew by 1.9%. Growth of 2% would still make Britain the fastest growing of the G7 countries in 2016 according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund.",

      "bodyText": "And finally, the chair of the Treasury select committee Andrew Tyrie has commented on the session with Bank of England governor Mark Carney. He said: The Governor has given strong advice today, both to the UK Government and to the governments of the rest of the EU. He\u2019s told the Government that it is \u201chighly advisable\u201d to seek agreement to transitional arrangements, and at the start of the negotiations. And he\u2019s also told the UK\u2019s negotiating counterparts in the EU that they, more than the UK, are vulnerable to financial stability risks during the period of transition. I hope they are all listening. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In Europe the mood was also fairly buoyant while in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ricocheted between positive and negative and positive again as president elect Donald Trump gave his press conference. The final scores in Europe showed: Germany\u2019s Dax rose 0.54% to 11,646.17 France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.01% to 4888.71 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.32% to 19,486.88 But Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.46% at 9408.6 Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 19 points at 19,874 having been as high as 19,973 and as low as 19,833 during the day so far. While Carney was speaking, the FTSE 100 ran up three new records, as continuing weakness in the pound - it hit a near 32 year low against the dollar excluding last year\u2019s flash crash- continued to drive overseas earners higher. The index smashed through the 7300 level although it later slipped back as the pound came off its worst levels, ending up 15.02 at 7290.49. That marked a new peak, the tenth day of record closes and the 12th day of rises. All three never seen before. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: The Footsie has now seen a dozen days of price increases, in what amounts to its longest winning streak ever. It won\u2019t go on forever, but the winter rally has shown it has considerable legs. It\u2019s not just the miners and international companies benefiting from lower sterling which are sustaining the rally, some domestically-focussed stocks are also chipping in, which suggests some optimism towards the prospects for UK companies is driving the market upward too. In a two and a half hour session, Bank of England chair Mark Carney and members of its financial policy committee were quizzed on Brexit, forecasting and stress tests. Carney said Brexit was no longer the most significant domestic risk to financial stablity. But he maintained that the Bank\u2019s actions had mitigated the risks around the referendum vote. On the Brexit discussions, Carney said the consequences of not having a transitional deal would be higher for the EU than for the UK. On the subject of the Bank getting its forecasts wrong ahead of the vote, FPC member Martin Taylor said that just because there had not been a problem yet, that meant there would not be problems. Carney says forecasting has improved because they look at what could go wrong rather than thinking everything was going right. He repeats that the Bank\u2019s actions and preparations helped mitigate some of the risks following the vote. Martin Taylor said he was surprised at the strength of the economy since the Brexit vote, but it was because forecasters overestimated the negative effect of the referendum on consumer confidence. Speaking of forecasts, Carney suggested the Bank was likely to lift its UK growth forecasts in February. Anil Kashyap of the FPC reckons the risk to financial stability has not yet increased because of the election of Donald Trump, but the Bank admitted it was monitoring the president elect\u2019s Twitter account given his potential for market moving comments. The Bank members also spent some time defending the latest bank stress tests, notably to suggestions they were not rigorous enough. And there were also concerns about the high levels of consumer credit. And after some discussion about the buy to let market, the session ends. Chair Andrew Tyrie says that \u201c as usual when we start talking about financial stability we end with the housing market\u201d, and thanks them for coming. Is housing market sustainable, with prices relative to income back to levels seen in 2008? Alex Brazier: That rise in level in house prices relative to income has not, as it did in 2008, meant a rise in household debt. It\u2019s not house prices per se, it\u2019s the level of household debt, and [that] shows a completely different picture. Question on the 10.8% growth in consumer credit last year. Is the Bank too relaxed or complacent about this? FPC executive director Alex Brazier says he\u2019s not relaxed: Consumer credit growth is difficult to ignore. What are the risks to financial stability? We have been discussing the loosening of credit conditions, such as a doubling of interest rate free periods for credit cards. We need to be alert and vigilant. It has been a driver of consumer spending, so it\u2019s important how we should address it, as it has a broader economic resilience. Carney and his committee defend the results of the tests, but says he welcomes analysis and discussion ( such as by the head of an independent review of banks Sir John Vickers, who said the stress tests were not rigorous enough.) An ITV report said using more rigorous tests would have meant only Lloyds passed, but Carney and co said they could not see how this result was achieved and seemed satisfied with the outcome of their own tests. Anil Kashyap says he expects it will become exceptional for UK banks to fail the stress test in future. Question on bank stress tests, when RBS failed in November: Should we expect every year to see at least one bank fail so we can\u2019t say they are not difficult enough. Martin Taylor: People say that anyway. We don\u2019t consider that. We try to set stress which is severe and plausible and put the system through the wringer. Meanwhile the pound has hit a new 31 year low against the dollar - excluding the flash crash - with the US currency boosted ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s press conference on hopes of details of his plans for the country\u2019s economy. Sterling has fallen as low as $1.2039 and is now down 1% at $1.2056. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said: The move looks dollar driven with the buck heavy bid at day highs across the board ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s news conference. It\u2019s now looking very precarious indeed for sterling and we could see it drop further as stops are triggered. Cable is down another 1% today and is flirting with flash crash lows and could spark more selling. The correlation between the pound and the FTSE is obvious. The sharp move south at 15:18 saw sterling dip half a cent against the dollar in just a minute and we witnessed a corresponding move in the FTSE 100 at the exact same time, with the index jumping 10 points in 60 seconds. At pixel time it was rocking new highs at 7,321, on course for yet another record close. Question: Do you monitor Trump\u2019s Twitter account in case he says something,. Carney: Yes. We monitor your Twitter account, chairman. So yes we follow it. We look forward to working with the new US members. Tyrie: is Trump a risk to financial stability? Anil Kashyap: The committee hasn\u2019t discussed this but personally, the first thing will be Trump filling the vice chair position at Federal Reserve. That could change the way the Fed negotiates over financial stability issues. It still takes 60 votes in Senate to do many things, anything attached to tax and spending review you need 50. Anything to do with rolling back Dodd Franks, they can\u2019t do that will just 50 votes. He can do personal changes immediately. Tyrie: so has risk up or stayed the same? The same, the number of things the US can do unilaterally that he can trigger is limited in the short term. Carney says what is true is that growth has been remarkably weak and the general level of income growth has been weak... which is a product of meagre productivity performance in this country. Mann: Do you regard inequality as a problem? Carney says the level of wealth and income inequality has gone down over the last decade, the level has gone up among generations. Since interest rates fell and QE introduced, wealth and income has risen. Is inequality an issue in this county? One of the issues is that in general within advanced economies increases in inequality have some potential to reduce the equilibrium interest rate. That means running the economy for some time with low interest rates which runs greater risk to financial stability. As Carney speaks, the FTSE 100 has crossed the 7300 line. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: With Mark Carney stating \u2013 after a bit of coercion from the Treasury Select Committee \u2013 that Brexit is no longer the signal most significant domestic risk to the UK\u2019s financial stability the FTSE received the final push it needed to cross 7300 this Wednesday. The comments also helped to lift the pound against the euro, but failed to have much impact on sterling\u2019s losses against the dollar, with the greenback taking half a percent off of the UK currency. Carney says we are starting to get an increase in inflation and a slowdown in growth has not yet transpired. John Mann: are none of you surprised at the health of the economy. Martin Taylor: I\u2019m surprised, it is better than I expected. The conclusions drawn about forecasters are wrong: that they\u2019re hopeless, politically biased, or there\u2019s been some miracle in the economy. It is more prosaic. There is no precedent for major country to tear up trade deals and go off into a new world. Any forecaster has got to suppose there will be a confidence effect. The mistake was not to forecast the scale of the confidence effect on the consumer. They\u2019ve got on with their lives, partly thanks to consumer credit. Rees Mogg: But the forecasts were inaccurate. Carney: Speaking as the MPC, the MPC had a more positive forecast than others in August, it took action to reinforce the situation, it upgraded its forecasts. \u201cI would say, and I\u2019ll say this very lightly, that recent data would be consistent with some further upgrade of the forecast but that forecast has not yet started\u201d We have expected there will be some slowing of the economy this year, related to some effects of Brexit. Missing the financial crisis is a big deal, a couple of different quarters is nice to have, it\u2019s a different order of magnitude. Rees Mogg continues: But the forecasting around Brexit was just as inaccurate as before the financial crisis of 2008. Carney says the risk aspect around Brexit was right and the steps we took (helped mitigate it). There was hard money in the market, a lot of major institutions would have been caught on the wrong side. The reason they weren\u2019t is Bank identified risk of outcomes of Brexit vote and took it off the table. Bank ensured markets especially derivatives markets were liquid [ahead of the vote}. On the morning after... it was important the system was rock solid. So the assessment was right in terms of the risk and the steps taken to mitigate the risk were necessary. In that sense, we were making the weather. On forecasting Carney says the way we have to get better - and it has improved - is by looking at what could go wrong rather than just what could go right. In subprime a lot of time was spent saying there wasn\u2019t a problem rather than saying, if there is a problem, what could go wrong? Away from Carney for a moment, and an update on the state of the UK economy. UK ouput grew by 0.5% in the three months ending in December 2016, after the same level of growth in the three months to November, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The thinktank said it estimated the economy grew by 2% in 2016, compared to 2.2% in 2015. But there could be clouds ahead. James Warren, Research Fellow at NIESR, said \u201cOur estimates suggest the economy grew by 2 per cent in 2016, in line with the long run potential growth rate of the UK economy. The composition of economic growth in 2016 has been unbalanced: robust consumer spending has compensated for the weakness in other sectors. Consumers face significant headwinds this year and next, not least the increase in consumer price inflation that is a consequence of pass through from the depreciation of sterling in 2016.\u201d Rees Mogg turns to Carney now and forecasting. On the Michael Fish quote, he says Fish\u2019s boss apologised for the hurricane mistake 24 years later, so they may call Carney back in 24 years time. Carney does not look amused. Kashyap says Brexit will be a leap and we have no certainty how well it will go. And now Jacob Rees Mogg, who has clashed with Carney before. He starts though with Martin Taylor, and asks how Brexit will affect ways of looking at stability. Taylor says, it depends on result of the arrangements we\u2019ve been talking about. Member Anil Kashyap says Bank will resist low regulation, light touch approach as much as it can after Brexit. Rees Mogg There has not been any great impact so far [from the Brexit vote}, but the Bank had been quite concerned. Taylor: The Bank was quite concerned, we were concerned to provide liquidity ahead of the vote, and after to make sure business as usual. The third phase will be after Brexit happens. The phase we\u2019re now in will throw up its own challenges. I don\u2019t share view that because there has not been a problem yet there won\u2019t be one in future. It becomes increasingly difficult to disentangle what was due to Brexit and what would have happened anyway. Carney says it is possible and desirable for UK to remain part of the EU customs union. This is the way the global economy should work, he says. He adds the Bank\u2019s FPC itself has not taken a view on whether the UK should stay. My colleague Jill Treanor writes: Douglas Flint, chairman of HSBC, appears to started something yesterday when he likened the risks of Brexit to Jenga. Andrew Tyrie, chairman of Treasury select committee, has been asking Mark Carney about it today. The governor of the Bank of England has admitted it is a \u201cdecent analogy\u201d. \u201cJust like when you play Jenga and you start early there are some pieces you can take out without imperilling the tower\u201d says Carney.The Jenga problem starts when capacity is taken out of the market. The argument being that the EU 27 relies on the City for its financing and, argues Carney, faces a greater risk to financial stability than the UK from Brexit. Question: Are there any substantive reasons - leaving aside political reasons - the EU would not grant the UK equivalence, treating UK financial rules as equivalent to EU ones? No, not at all, says Carney. Carney says we don\u2019t want to be a rule taker. We feel the regulatory construct within the EU is as we would have it. Once we\u2019re not there, I expect we will get rules with which we don\u2019t agree. We want equivalance with EU rules, but not cutting and pasting EU rule changes. Earlier Carney agreed that describing the stability of the UK financial system after Brexit as a game of jenga was a decent analogy. If the permanance of access to EU financial markets comes into question, it would raise economic and financial stability issues. The British government would have to make political choices on EU access. One of the Bank\u2019s FPC members Martin Taylor says it is important to get EU transitional arrangements in place as soon as possible. On a transitional arrangement, Carney says it is in the interests of UK and the EU27 that there is a transition phase. Is it necessary to avoid serious risks, ask Tyrie. \u201cit is the best mitigant to those risks, highly advisable. If there is not such a transition, we will work to mitigate those consqeences. The consequences would be higher for EU but there would also be consequences for the UK.\u201d Tyrie asks if Brexit is still the most significant risk to financial stability. Carney is trying not to be drawn, saying the biggest risks to the Uk economy are external, but the Bank also identified four domestic risks. Tyrie presses whether Brexit is still the most signifiant internal risk. A pause then Carney says the Bank\u2019s committee has not termed it that way. \u201cWe have four risks, Brexit amplifies some of those risks,\u201d Tyrie persists: \u201cYes or no\u201d Carney: \u201cNo. In the run up to the referendum we felt it was largest risk because there were things that could have happened which had financial stability implications. Actions were taken to mitigate that, but having got through the day after, the scale of the immediate risks has gone down.\u201d Mark Carney is up at the select committee, and is immediatly asked by chair Andrew Tyrie whether he agrees with Andy Haldane\u2019s assessment that forecasters had a Michael Fish moment, in failing to predict the outcome of various events including Brexit. Carney bats this away, saying one advantage of abolishing group think is that you don\u2019t always agree with colleagues. He said Haldane was talking about ability to identify risk, he suggested some solutions but our responsibity to financial stability is to identify it and take mitigating action. The probe with success is the risk doesn\u2019t happen. \u201cI do think we helped make the weather [around the time of the vote], we mitigated risk and put country in better place.\u201d (Carney is talking about the interest rate cut and other actions the bank took the day after the vote)arrangements. Over in parliament governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is set to face the Treasury Select Committee shortly. Carney is being quizzed on the Bank\u2019s financial stability report at the end of November, which saw RBS fail the latest stress tests and the Bank warn on a number of matters, including the uncertainty created by the Brexit vote, the commercial property sector, high level of debts in UK households and the potential vulnerability of the economy to a reduction in foreign investors buying UK debt. After its record breaking run of nine closing highs, the FTSE 100 is continuing to move ahead. The leading index, again boosted by mining shares benefitting from the weak pound and supermarkets following Sainsbury\u2019s well received update, has hit a new peak of 7296. This is tantalisingly close to the 7300 level but whether the UK index follows Wall Street\u2019s pattern - the Dow Jones Industrial Average was on the verge of breaking 20,000 last week before falling back - remains to be seen. Currently the FTSE 100 is up 0.25% at 7293. Speaking of the Dow, it is virtually flat ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s press conference later, which may see some detail about his plans to boost the economy and may also get some questions about other matters. WEF also asks its panellists to list their greatest risks, in terms of the impact they would have on the global economy. Between 2007 and 2014, this list was always topped by financial worries -- such as asset price crashes, a fiscal crisis, or a major failure of the whole system But this year, the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction has climbed to the top of the list, followed by a string of environmental worries. One obvious problem with the World Economic Forum\u2019s global risks report is that Davos is stuffed each year with the politicians, business leaders, economists and other \u2018global elite\u2019 who have led the global economy to its current state. Issues such as climate change and economic inequality have been creeping up WEF\u2019s agenda for several years -- \u2018severe income disparity\u2019 was ranked as the most likely danger to the economy in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Indeed, three years ago Davos began with a stern lecture from the Pope to improve wealth equality and help those in \u2018dire poverty. It is intolerable that thousands of people continue to die every day from hunger, even though substantial quantities are available and wasted. But none of this halted the push towards populism that gripped 2016, and could do the same next year too. Speaking on Bloomberg earlier, WEF\u2019s head of global competitiveness, Margareta Drzeniek-Hanouz, said this year\u2019s Davos gathering will seek solutions to income inequality. She argued that Davos is open to populist voices, as elected politicians should represent the view of the people, along with representatives of civic society, charities, etc. But Jenny Ricks of the Fight Inequality Alliance, for example, isn\u2019t convinced that the Davos elite will find the answers. WEF\u2019s report also highlights that the richest 1% in the US have done particularly well over the last few decades. And with great timing, a group of economists at the Norwegian School of Economics and Stockholm University have published the results of an experiment into whether Americans are more relaxed than Norwegians about inequality. My colleague Katie Allen explains: The researchers wanted to assess how people reacted to inequality that stemmed from brute luck. Spectators were told that worker A and worker B did work of the same quality but that in a lottery it had been randomly decided the entire $6 earnings bonus would go to worker A. The spectators were asked if they would like to leave things as they were or redistribute the bonus between the two workers. The researchers\u2019 findings were striking.Among Norwegian spectators, 80% chose to redistribute the bonus and make it equal between the two workers. Among Americans only 50% chose to share it out. They also found that Americans were much more reluctant to redistribute bonuses paid on merit..... More here: Climate change dangers also dominate the risk landscape for 2017, WEF says. Its global risks report singles out the danger of extreme weather events, as both the likeliest threat and one of the most damaging (beaten only by the dangers of weapons of mass destruction). Water crises, often caused by changes to the weather, also features high up the list of dangers (continuing a recent trend), along with the risk that governments fail to mitigate against climate change. WEF says: This year, environmental concerns are more prominent than ever, with all five risks in this category assessed as being above average for both impact and likelihood.... Iineffective management of the \u201cglobal commons\u201d \u2013 the oceans, atmosphere, and climate system \u2013 can have local as well as global consequences. For example, changing weather patterns or water crises can trigger or exacerbate geopolitical and societal risks such as domestic or regional conflict and involuntary migration, particularly WEF\u2019s report argues that income inequality can\u2019t be solely blamed for Donald Trump\u2019s victory. Instead, it singles out the rapid changes in society over the last few decades that left many feeling left behind, or treated unfairly. Early analysis by political scientists Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris points to the populism behind the victories of Brexit and President-elect Trump as being driven more by demographics and cultural factors than income inequality: a backlash among older and less-educated voters who \u201cfeel that they are being marginalized within their own countries\u201d by changing values in areas such as gender, sexual orientation, race, multiculturalism, environmental protection and international cooperation. Pew research found stark divisions in the self-described values of supporters of President-elect Trump and Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton: for example, 72% of President-elect Trump\u2019s supporters described themselves as \u201ctraditional\u201d, versus 31% of Clinton supporters; other big differences included \u201chonor and duty are my core values\u201d (59% vs 35%); \u201ctypical American\u201d (72% vs 49%), \u201cfeminist\u201d (5% vs 38%) and \u201csupporter of LGBT rights\u201d (24% vs 66%). New technologies such as self-driving cars and smart robots could also threaten global stability in the years ahead, according to today\u2019s report. WEF\u2019s experts said that artificial intelligence and robotics is \u201cthe emerging technology with the greatest potential for negative consequences over the coming decade\u201d. That\u2019s because tens of millions of jobs will be lost as work is increasingly handed to automated systems, in the so-called \u2018Fourth Industrial Revolution\u201d. The report says: Estimates of the number of jobs at risk to technological displacement vary: a frequently cited 2013 Oxford Martin School study has suggested that 47% of US jobs were at high risk from automation; in 2016 an OECD working paper put the figure lower, at 9%. In 2015 a McKinsey study concluded that 45% of the activities that workers do today could already be automated if companies choose to do so..... Technology has always created jobs as well as destroying them, but there is evidence that the engine of technological job creation is sputtering. The Oxford Martin School estimates that only 0.5% of today\u2019s US workforce is employed in sectors created since 2000, compared with approximately 8% in industries created during the 1980s. Technological change is shifting the distribution of income from labour to capital: according to the OECD, up to 80% of the decline in labour\u2019s share of national income between 1990 and 2007 was the result of the impact of technology. Cecilia Reyes, chief risk officer at Zurich, says these changes are a key cause of social instability. WEF singles out Donald Trump\u2019s victory and the Brexit vote as the \u201chighest-profile signs\u201d of rising political discontent. Today\u2019s report says: That discontent with the current order has now become an election-winning proposition clearly increases the urgency of understanding and responding to these global risks. But what\u2019s the solution? WEF has a five-point plan: fostering greater solidarity and long-term thinking in market capitalism, revitalizing global economic growth, recognizing the importance of identity and inclusiveness in healthy political communities, mitigating the risks and exploiting the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and strengthening our systems of global cooperation. WEF say that anger over economic inequality could shake the \u201csocial solidarity\u201d that underpins the status quo -- especially as global growth has been weak since the financial crisis. The report warns that: In sum, it is difficult to identify routes that will lead back to robust global rates of economic growth. However, growth is now only part of the challenge policymakers need to address. Concerns over income and wealth distribution are becoming more politically disruptive, and much greater emphasis is needed on the increasing financial insecurity that characterizes many people\u2019s lives. As socio-economic outcomes are increasingly determined globally, popular frustration is growing at the inability of national politics to provide stability. Economist Dani Rodrik coined the phrase \u201cthe globalization trilemma\u201d to capture his view that, among democracy, national sovereignty and global economic integration, only two are simultaneously compatible \u2013 and recent events in Europe and the United States suggest an appetite for rebalancing towards democracy and national sovereignty. The combination of economic inequality and political polarization threatens to amplify global risks, fraying the social solidarity on which the legitimacy of our economic and political systems rests. Blimey. The World Economic Forum has admitted that \u201cfundamental reforms\u201d to market capitalism may be needed, to tackle the public anger that led to Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. Setting the scene for next week\u2019s Davos, today\u2019s Global Risks Report points out that the public are losing faith with the status quo. (ie, many of the people who trek to the Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Switzerland). WEF says public anger is now a global issue: Years of building pressure in many parts of the world, at least since the global financial crisis, crystallized into dramatic political results during 2016 as public disaffection with the status quo gained traction. In the West, consensus expectations were defied by the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory in the United States and by the Italian electorate\u2019s rejection of Matteo Renzi\u2019s constitutional reforms. The implications of results such as these are potentially far-reaching \u2013 some people question whether the West has reached a tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalization. But the uncertainty and instability that characterized 2016 are not Western phenomena alone: we saw variations of them in countries across the world, including Brazil, the Philippines and Turkey. Crucially, WEF acknowledges that simply encouraging economic growth is not the answer. Instead, fundamental reforms are needed to tackle anger against the richest in society. The report states: Despite unprecedented levels of peace and global prosperity, in many countries a mood of economic malaise has contributed to anti-establishment, populist politics and a backlash against globalization. The weakness of the economic recovery following the global financial crisis is part of this story, but boosting growth alone would not remedy the deeper fractures in our political economy. More fundamental reforms to market capitalism may be needed to tackle, in particular, an apparent lack of solidarity between those at the top of national income and wealth distributions and those further down. WEF also produced this chart, showing how the recovery since 2008 has been the weakest in at least 40 years: You can see the report here: WEF: Global Risks Report 2017 WEF are presenting the findings at a press conference now - it\u2019s being streamed here. This chart from WEF shows how the world economy faces an interconnected web of risks. \u2018Rising income and wealth inequality\u2019 is the most important, according to the 700 experts surveyed for this report, due to unemployment and its link to social instability. Here\u2019s the top five trends that will determine the future of the global economy ove the next decade, according to the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Risks report. Rising Income and wealth disparity Changing climate Increasing polarization of societies Rising cyber dependency Ageing population Newsflash: The World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Risks Report 2017 is just being released. And it singles out \u201ceconomic inequality\u201d as the biggest issue in the global economy over the next decade, as income and wealth disparity continues to rise. The polarization of societies, and \u201cintensifying environmental dangers\u201d are the other top three trends that will shape global developments over the next 10 years. The report warns that: Trends such as rising income inequality and societal polarization triggered political change in 2016 and could exacerbate global risks in 2017 if urgent action is not taken, according to the Global Risks Report 2017 WEF says that world leaders need to \u201curgently\u201d work together to avert further hardship and volatility in the coming decade. Here\u2019s the key bullet points from the report: Patterns persist. Rising income and wealth disparity and increasing polarization of societies were ranked first and third, respectively, among the underlying trends that will determine global developments in the next ten years. Similarly, the most interconnected pairing of risks in this year\u2019s survey is between high structural unemployment or underemployment and profound social instability. The environment dominates the global risks landscape. Climate change was the number two underlying trend this year. And for the first time, all five environmental risks in the survey were ranked both high-risk and high-likelihood, with extreme weather events emerging as the single most prominent global risk. Society is not keeping pace with technological change. Of the 12 emerging technologies examined in the report, experts found artificial intelligence and robotics to have the greatest potential benefits, but also the greatest potential negative effects and the greatest need for better governance. More to follow... A few eyebrows were raised in the City when Sainsbury\u2019s launched a takeover bid for catalogue retailer Argos last year. But no-one\u2019s carping now, after the supermarket chain released forecast-beating results over the Christmas period, mainly thanks to a 4% jump in like-for-like sales at Argos. That\u2019s sent Sainsbury\u2019s shares up 6% this morning, to the top of the FTSE 100. More here: Over in the City, estate agent Foxtons\u2019 shares have hit their lowest level ever after another disappointing financial statement. It admitted that core profits almost halved for 2016 to \u00a325m, from \u00a346m in 2015, as it suffers from the slowdown in the London property market since the EU referendum. Sales in the last quarter of 2016 dropped to just \u00a312m, from \u00a320m, as \u201cvolumes remained subdued\u201d. And this year won\u2019t be much better, warned CEO Nic Budden: Looking ahead, we expect trading conditions to remain challenging in 2017. Should current levels of sales activity continue in the short term, it is likely that 2017 volumes will be below those in 2016. Our balanced business model provides resilience against sales market cycles and we have a strong balance sheet with no debt. This sent Foxtons shares down by 10% in early trading to just 90p, the lowest since the company floated on the stock market in 2013. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The World Economic Forum is releasing its Global Risks Report for 2017, at 9am, to set the scene for next week\u2019s meeting in Davos. This report will identify the five biggest threats to the world, and what needs to be done to protect us from their worst effects. After a dramatic 2016, geopolitics will loom large on this year\u2019s report -- given the imminent arrival of Donald Trump in the White House, and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the EU. Climate Change, migration, cybercrime and pandemics could also feature highly too. WEF, which is one of the cheerleaders for globalisation, is concerned that that the recent rise of populism will undermine global efforts to work together on these problems. It says: 2016 saw a crystallization of political risks that have led to the election of populist leaders, a loss of faith in institutions and increased strain on international cooperation. We should not be surprised by this: for the past decade, the Global Risks Report has been drawing attention to persistent economic, social and political factors that have been shaping our risks landscape. The report comes hot on the heels of a new report from the World Bank, released last night, which cites Brexit and president-elect Trump as key threats to growth this year. The World Bank\u2019s Global Economic Prospects report warns that: \u201cThe heightened level of policy uncertainty, especially regarding trade, has been exacerbated by recent political developments \u2013 most notably in the United States and the United Kingdom. \u201cThis and other risks \u2013 particularly financial market disruptions amid tighter global financing conditions \u2013 may be amplified over time by mounting protectionist tendencies, slower potential growth and elevated vulnerabilities in some emerging markets and developing countries.\u201d Also coming up today.... The City look a little subdued today, with the FTSE 100 expected to dip this morning after hitting its record-breaking ninth record closing high in a row yesterday. There\u2019s a splurge of UK economy data at 9.30am, with new trade and industrial production surveys for November. Bank of England governor Mark Carney is testifying to parliament\u2019s Treasury Committee at 2.15pm today, to discuss last month\u2019s financial stability report. This means another battle with eurosceptic MPs who criticise its warnings ahead of June\u2019e EU referendum, and its actions since. On the corporate front, supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s, estate agent Foxtons, and cinema chain Cineworld are reporting results.",

      "bodyText": "A better than expected Christmas at Sainsbury\u2019s has reinforced the logic of its \u00a31.4bn takeover of Argos, according to the supermarket\u2019s boss. Sainsbury\u2019s shares rose more than 6% as the retailer surprised the City with a record Christmas week and its first sales growth since March, before settling back to close just over 1% higher. Like-for-like sales excluding fuel, stripping out those at stores open for less than a year, rose by 0.1% in the 15 weeks to 7 January, beating expectations of a 0.8% drop. Sainsbury\u2019s said the volume of groceries sold remained steady as it slashed the number of multibuy offers in stores and price deflation slowed to 0.5% in the quarter compared with a 1% fall in the previous six months. Britain\u2019s second largest supermarket chain said online groceries, convenience stores, clothing and other non-food performed strongly in the third quarter. Food and grocery sales in established supermarkets fell for the group as a whole, but rose by 1-2% in those containing Argos outlets. Mike Coupe, Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe continue to see the grocery supermarket business being challenging but we know that we have some solutions to that \u2013 not least, when we put in an Argos store grocery sales go up. We believe we now have our destiny in our own hands.\u201d The group plans to put 250 Argos outlets into Sainsbury\u2019s stores over the next three years, up from 30 at present. At least 15 more will be open by the beginning of March, some of which are expected to be relocated from high streets and retail parks. Sainsbury\u2019s sales growth was lower than the 2.9% reported by Morrisons, which enjoyed its best Christmas in seven years. Booths, the upmarket northern grocer, reported a 2.6% rise in sales at established stores during the three weeks to 7 January, partly bolstered by the full reopening of its Keswick store, which was affected by flooding in 2015. The company said sales of champagne, salmon and craft ales had been particularly strong. Coupe said Sainsbury\u2019s had achieved a \u201cvery creditable performance in a very challenging period of time\u201d. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been through some of the trevails and traumas some of our competitors have been through,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a pretty consistent performance over the last five years and these numbers give us and the outside world confidence that we are putting the building blocks in place for the future. We have the right strategy.\u201d Like-for-like sales at Argos rose by 4%, more than double the rate expected by the City, driven by its Black Friday offers and the key Christmas trading period. Toys and technology including Fitbits, mobile phones and computers all sold well. Argos booked more than half its sales online, helping the group tap into a switch away from high streets towards the internet over Christmas. Sainsbury\u2019s sales growth was boosted by a 10% rise in clothing sales, 9% growth online and a 6% rise in sales at its convenience stores. While food sales slipped back, Coupe insisted that Sainsbury\u2019s had not become distracted by the Argos acquisition and expansion of its bank and non-food business. He said Sainsbury\u2019s had experienced growth in areas where it had invested in price and quality such as its premium Taste the Difference party food, up by 50%, and Freefrom range of specialist allergy friendly foods, up 8%. \u201cThe heart of the business is all about being brilliant at food,\u201d he said. But Coupe sounded a note of caution about the months ahead, partly because of the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June. A weaker pound makes products imported from abroad more expensive. He said: \u201cThe market remains very competitive and the impact of the devaluation of sterling remains uncertain. However, we are well placed to navigate the external environment and remain focused on delivering our strategy.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s is ploughing ahead with cost savings. On Monday it will begin consultation with nearly 500 Argos staff at the Magna Park distribution centre near Milton Keynes, which will close at the end of this year. Workers will be transferred to Wincanton, a logistics firm which runs a number of Argos\u2019s warehouses, and many will have the opportunity to move to its site in Kettering. The Unite union said the move was \u201ca slap in the face for a long-established and loyal workforce and it is also a blow for the local economy.\u201d It said some workers from Magna Park would not be able to commute to Kettering, which is 25 miles away.",

While food sales slipped back, Coupe insisted that Sainsbury\u2019s had not become distracted by the Argos acquisition and expansion of its bank and non-food business.</p> <p>He said Sainsbury\u2019s had experienced growth in areas where it had invested in price and quality such as its premium Taste the Difference party food, up by 50%, and Freefrom range of specialist allergy friendly foods, up 8%.</p> <p>\u201cThe heart of the business is all about being brilliant at food,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But Coupe sounded a note of caution about the months ahead, partly because of the sharp drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June. A weaker pound makes products imported from abroad more expensive.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe market remains very competitive and the impact of the devaluation of sterling remains uncertain. However, we are well placed to navigate the external environment and remain focused on delivering our strategy.\u201d </p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s is ploughing ahead with cost savings. On Monday it will begin consultation with nearly 500 Argos staff at the Magna Park distribution centre near Milton Keynes, which will close at the end of this year. </p> <p>Workers will be transferred to Wincanton, a logistics firm which runs a number of Argos\u2019s warehouses, and many will have the opportunity to move to its site in Kettering.</p> <p>The Unite union said the move was \u201ca slap in the face for a long-established and loyal workforce and it is also a blow for the local economy.\u201d </p> <p>It said some workers from Magna Park would not be able to commute to Kettering, which is 25 miles away.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chinese leader Xi Jinping will lead an 80-strong delegation of business executives and billionaires to the annual gathering of the powerful and super-rich in Davos next week. Xi will be the first Chinese president to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) and lead the country\u2019s biggest-ever delegation to the celebration of capitalism in the Swiss Alps as a statement of intent that China wants to assume a global leadership role as other world powers struggle with domestic tumult. Xi\u2019s entourage will include some of the country\u2019s most powerful businessmen including Jack Ma, founder of internet group Alibaba; Wang Jianlin, chairman of property developer Dalian Wanda; and Zhang Yaqin, president of web services firm Baidu. Ma and Wang are China\u2019s two richest people, with fortunes estimated at $34.5bn (\u00a328.5bn) and $30.5bn, respectively, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. In an opening address to the conference in the exclusive ski resort, Xi will defend globalisation as US President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s threatens trade barriers and a US retreat from international deals. Xi will warn other world leaders, business executives and celebrities that the rise of populism could lead to \u201cwar, poverty, confrontation and domination\u201d as he takes on the mantle of defending globalisation. David Aikman, the WEF\u2019s chief China representative, said this year\u2019s Bejing delegation was so large that Chinese voices would be present in nearly all discussions at Davos and other participants want \u201cto know China\u2019s view on global and regional issues\u201d. Xi will push for greater international cooperation, development and economic globalisation to help build \u201ca human community with shared destiny\u201d. Jiang Jianguo, the head of China\u2019s state council information office, said: \u201cWith the rise of populism, protectionism, and nativism, the world has come to a historic crossroad where one road leads to war, poverty, confrontation and domination while the other road leads to peace, development, cooperation and win-win solutions.\u201d China\u2019s vice foreign minister Li Baodong told a briefing in Davos that Xi would set out Beijing\u2019s views on how to \u201csteer economic globalisation towards greater inclusiveness\u201d. The Chinese leader will also speak out against Trump\u2019s accusations that China is a \u201cbig abuser\u201d of free trade deals by artificially depressing its currency to boost exports at the expense of US jobs. Trump has vowed to impose import tariffs on Chinese goods. Li said Trump\u2019s attacks were unjustified and warned that \u201ctrade protectionism will lead to isolation and is in the interest of no one. Li suggested that Xi would be happy to meet members of Trump\u2019s transition team in Davos. \u201cThe channels of communication are open,\u201d Li said. Trump will not attend Davos, which starts just three days before his inauguration. The president-elect will be represented at Davos by Anthony Scaramucci, a multi-millionaire hedge fund manager and member of Trump\u2019s presidential transition team. Scaramucci, founder of hedge fund SkyBridge Capital and lavish Las Vegas investment conference Salt, is expected to this week be given an official White House role advising Trump on business affairs. Xi is attending Davos as part of a three-day state visit to Switzerland, including a speech to the United Nations in Geneva on Wednesday.",

    "webTitle": "Foxtons shares slump after significant fall in London property sales", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Foxtons has unveiled a sharp drop in profits and has warned that housing sales would decline in the year ahead if demand for properties fails to pick up. The London estate agent\u2019s trading update added to fears over the state of the capital\u2019s housing market, and traders were quick to offload shares in the company. Foxtons\u2019 shares plummeted 12% to 87p after the update was released, ending the day down 3.3% at 95.75p. Those shares were valued at 230p when the business floated in 2013 and hit 373p in early 2014. Prices in central London\u2019s top postcodes, where Foxtons mainly operates, have fallen sharply in recent months. In order to reduce its reliance on central London, the company has been pushing into the capital\u2019s outer areas such as Peckham and Vauxhall. Nic Budden, its chief executive, said 2016 had been a challenging year, with revenues falling to \u00a3133m from \u00a3150m in 2015 after a significant drop in sales. Underlying earnings for the full year are expected to be \u00a325m, down from \u00a346m a year earlier. \u201cLooking ahead, we expect trading conditions to remain challenging in 2017. Should current levels of sales activity continue in the short term, it is likely that 2017 volumes will be below those in 2016,\u201d he said. A company spokesman said Foxtons had been hit by uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote, affecting foreign buyers in particular; the impact of last April\u2019s 3% stamp duty rise on the top end of the market; and general affordability issues, with rising house prices far outstripping wage growth in recent years. Figures published last month by mortgage lender Nationwide showed house prices in London last year grew at a slower rate than the national average for the first time in eight years. Taylor Wimpey, one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, said on Wednesday that lower selling prices in central London had also affected its performance, sending its shares 2.5% lower to 170.6p. Budden said Foxtons was resilient against market cycles and had a strong balance sheet with no debt. \u201cAs the most recognised residential brand in London, we are uniquely positioned to manage through the market uncertainties and take advantage of any change in conditions,\u201d he added. The company\u2019s lettings business performed better than sales in the fourth quarter, with revenue unchanged at about \u00a313m as the number of new tenants fell but existing tenants renewed their contracts. But analysts at Peel Hunt said the government\u2019s proposed ban on letting fees could lead to further pressure on profits. Anthony Codling, analyst at the investment bank Jefferies, said 2017 would be a tougher year for Foxtons than 2016. \u201cFoxtons have said what most of London was already thinking, the housing sales market has slowed since a certain EU referendum, macroeconomic uncertainty has led to a fall in housing transactions and renters in sympathy seem to be staying put for longer. We are reducing our [earnings] estimates today, but Foxtons remains a fighter and its focus on cash should be rewarded.\u201d Foxtons, which opened its first branch in Notting Hill Gate, west London, in 1981, now has 65 branches. It has scaled back new office openings this year, but is planning to open two more in outer London \u2013 Wembley and Wood Green \u2013 by the end of March. The company will publish its 2016 results on 8 March.",

    "webTitle": "Rising inequality threatens world economy, says WEF", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Rising income inequality and the polarisation of societies pose a risk to the global economy in 2017 and could result in the rolling back of globalisation unless urgent action is taken, according to the World Economic Forum. Before its annual meeting in Davos next week, the WEF said the gap between rich and poor had been behind the UK\u2019s Brexit vote and Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in the US. And it warned that there were new threats to social cohesion from the robotics and artificial intelligence revolution. The organisation said fundamental reform of capitalism may be needed to tackle public anger. The WEF\u2019s annual global risks report \u2013 culled from 700 experts \u2013 found that rising income and wealth disparity, and increasing polarisation of sectors of society, were ranked first and third among the underlying trends that will determine the shape of the world in the next decade. Climate change was considered the second most important underlying trend, with the WEF noting that environmental concerns were more prominent in the report than ever before. Trump\u2019s inauguration on 20 January coincides with next week\u2019s Davos meeting and the founder of the WEF, Klaus Schwab, said 2017 would be a pivotal moment for the global community. \u201cThe threat of a less cooperative, more inward-looking world also creates the opportunity to address global risks and the trends that drive them,\u201d he said. The WEF said the growing mood of anti-establishment populism meant economic growth was no longer enough to mend fractured societies and that \u201cfundamental reforms of market capitalism\u201d would now be needed. The global risks report said Brexit, the US presidential election result and the referendum defeat suffered by former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi last month meant some people were now questioning whether \u201cthe west has reached a tipping point and might now embark on a period of deglobalisation\u201d. The US economist Dani Rodrik has coined the phrase \u201cthe globalisation trilemma\u201d to capture the idea that countries cannot have democracy, national sovereignty and globalisation; they can only ever have two out of the three. The WEF said recent events in Europe and the US suggested an \u201cappetite for rebalancing towards democracy and national sovereignty\u201d. The WEF said it had been pointing out the dangers of rising inequality and political polarisation for more than a decade, but that the slow pace of recovery from the deep recession of 2008 had intensified income gaps within countries. Emergency measures such as quantitative easing \u2013 the creation of money by central banks \u2013 had become permanent features of economic policy, and had exacerbated inequality by boosting the returns of those holding financial assets. It added that the trends of recent years had come into sharp focus in 2016 with rising discontent and disaffection evident in the UK referendum and in the US with Trump\u2019s victory over Hillary Clinton. \u201cUrgent action is needed \u2026 to overcome political or ideological differences and work together to solve critical challenges,\u201d said Margareta Drzeniek-Hanouz, head of global competitiveness and risks at the WEF. \u201cThe momentum of 2016 towards addressing climate change shows this is possible and offers hope that collective action at the international level aimed at resetting other risks could also be achieved.\u201d The report warned that society was not keeping pace with technological change. It found that of 12 emerging technologies, artificial intelligence and robotics had the greatest potential benefits but also contained the greatest negative threats. \u201cTechnology has always created jobs as well as destroying them, but there is evidence that the engine of technological job creation is sputtering,\u201d the report said, citing evidence that only 0.5% of the current US workforce was employed in sectors created since 2000 compared with approximately 8% in industries created in the 1980s. \u201cTechnological change is shifting the distribution of income from labour to capital: according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, up to 80% of the decline in labour\u2019s share of national income between 1980 and 2007 was the result of the impact of technology.\u201d The WEF\u2019s top five risks to the global economy for 2017: 1 Rising income and wealth disparity Since the 1980s, the share of income going to the top 1% wealthiest citizens has increased in the UK, the US, Canada, Ireland and Australia \u2013 though not Germany, France, Japan or Sweden \u2013 says the WEF. This group has shielded itself from austerity and the worst of the post-financial crash recession. Investments in new technology put a premium on workers with higher education and better skills, leaving the unskilled to languish on low pay, while globalisation has raised the incomes of the world\u2019s poorer workers at the expense of those in the west. The discontent this brings about \u201chas now become an election-winning proposition\u201d that demands action, says the WEF. 2 Changing climate Climate change is ranked as the second biggest risk for this year, due in part to the increasingly frequent extreme weather that it heralds. While the end of the cyclical global weather phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o means 2017 is unlikely to top 2016 as the hottest on record, the Met Office forecasts it will still globally be one of the warmest ever. The heat is also likely to be cooler in political circles after last year, which saw the Paris climate agreement ratified at breakneck speed and several other climate deals agreed. This year governments must get on with actually delivering the carbon curbs they promised at Paris \u2013 as the WEF points out, the pace at which emissions are being cut is not yet fast enough to avoid dangerous global warming. 3 Increasing polarisation in societies The WEF is concerned that democracy itself is in crisis. Policymakers and managers of public and private institutions have become divorced from their electorates both in terms of their cultural backgrounds and their pay and benefits. Post-truth news media is undermining trust in pillars of the constitution, such as the judiciary. Austerity is hacking back at welfare provision for the vulnerable in society. And multiculturalism is under pressure from nationalism. \u201cThis could be a pivotal moment in political history,\u201d the WEF said, \u201cand it requires courageous new thinking about how best to manage the relationship between citizens and their elected representatives.\u201d 4 Rising cyber dependency Amazon Echo\u2019s virtual assistant Alexa adding unwanted items including doll\u2019s houses to shopping lists is just one example of the problems arising from an ever more interconnected world. An increasing amount of critical infrastructure relies, not just on information technology in general, but on the open internet in particular. This has brought great benefits but it also provides more opportunity for anyone hoping to wreak havoc through hacking attacks. Beyond critical infrastructure, the developed world relies on the open net for a large proportion of economic activity. An estimated 10% of British GDP comes from the \u201cinternet economy\u201d. 5 Ageing population A quarter of Japan\u2019s population is aged over 65, and the proportion is on track to reach 40%. Japanese people younger than 19 comprised 40% of the population in 1960, but are projected to make up just 13% of the population in 2060. The rest of the developed world, and much of the developing world, is heading in the same direction. To fund welfare programmes, including a long-term care insurance begun in 2000 that ranks as one of the most generous in the world, Tokyo has run up a debt to GDP ratio of 240%. This culminated in a plea for the fit elderly to look after the unfit, the disabled and ill. It could be argued that Britain\u2019s current healthcare crisis is largely due to successive governments ignoring the lessons from Japan. China is getting old at the point it gets rich, forcing it to address care and healthcare issues decades before western countries at a similar stage of development. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 January 2017. An earlier version referred to Japan\u2019s budget deficit where its debt to GDP ratio was meant.",

      "bodyText": "Malta has been accused of being a tax haven, just as it takes the helm of the European Union in a critical year for the bloc\u2019s crackdown on tax avoidance. The EU\u2019s smallest member state helped multinationals avoid paying \u20ac14bn (\u00a312.1bn) in taxes between 2012 and 2015 that would have gone to other countries, according to a report commissioned by Green MEPs in the European parliament. Malta could be deemed a tax haven according to EU\u2019s own criteria, concludes the report, which was written by accountancy lecturer Tommaso Faccio of Nottingham University Business School. The Maltese prime minister, Joseph Muscat, faced calls to resign last year, after the leaked Panama papers showed two of his allies had offshore accounts, including health and energy minister Konrad Mizzi. Malta, which has a population of 430,000, took over the EU\u2019s rotating presidency on 1 January. During its six months at the helm, EU finance ministers will discuss legal proposals that would require large multinationals operating in Europe to disclose profits earned and taxes paid \u2013 \u201ccountry by country\u201d reporting that has long been demanded by transparency campaigners. The EU\u2019s 28 countries will also attempt to advance work on a list of tax havens, promised by the end of the year. Tax campaigners are questioning whether Malta has the political will to push this agenda, pointing out that the government does not mention tax in its presidency priorities. Sven Gielgold, a German Green MEP who campaigns on taxation, told the Guardian the study showed Malta was a tax haven, according to EU criteria. \u201cThe tax system in Malta is generous to say the least, with large companies routinely paying as little as 5% tax on their profits. This is completely unacceptable and raises serious questions.\u201d On paper, Malta has the highest corporation tax in the EU \u2013 35%. But the report states that the actual rate is only 5%, once generous refunds on dividends are taken into account, an analysis backed up by an earlier study from the EU executive. The latest report also singles out an elaborate regime of tax breaks for intellectual property that amount to \u201caggressive tax planning\u201d, allowing some companies to pay zero corporation tax. Malta, however, has agreed to phase out its patent-box scheme, which allows some companies to pay zero corporation tax on a broad definition of intellectual innovation. The report states that between 2012 and 2015 close to \u20ac14bn in taxes was lost to other nations\u2019 treasuries, because of Malta\u2019s regime on dividends earned in foreign countries. Last year, the EU executive found that Malta offered \u201ctoo generous\u201d tax exemption on company dividends. EU officials found a total of 14 \u201caggressive tax planning indicators\u201d, putting the country just ahead of Luxembourg in a league table. Only the Netherlands, Belgium and Cyprus were deemed to have more indicators of aggressive tax planning. The UK was judged to have eight such indicators, according to the study, which assessed 33 different policies to determine whether a government was helping companies to avoid paying tax. A government spokesperson rejected the claims in the report, pointing to a range of technical standards the Maltese government had adopted through the EU and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the rich-country thinktank that has become an international forum for tax reform. He pointed to the government\u2019s promise \u201cto carry forward\u201d work on a number of draft EU laws on tax, including country-by-country reporting, in a document released on Monday.",

    "sectionName": "Business", 
    "webTitle": "Rail franchise mandarin's board gave Southern contract to client of his company", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The civil servant who awarded Southern its rail franchise made the decision to do so while owning a large share in a consultancy that had been advising the troubled operator\u2019s parent company. Peter Wilkinson, who had been hired by the Department for Transport (DfT) to act as its franchising director, was involved in awarding the Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern franchises to Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) in May 2014. At the time, he was a director and the joint main shareholder of First Class Partnerships, which he continued to be for 20 months after his hiring by the DfT in January 2013. Wilkinson had been managing the consultancy, which styled itself as \u201ca leading rail industry boutique consultancy business\u201d, since 2002, but stepped down when the government employed him as a contractor under an agreement with FCP. Govia was a longstanding client of Wilkinson\u2019s company and had been paying it for consultancy advice six months before the franchise was awarded. The government is paying Govia about \u00a38.9bn over seven years to run the three-franchise network, which is the largest to date in terms of passenger numbers. Southern rail passengers have experienced months of strikes, delays and cancellations amid a long-running industrial dispute over the role of train guards. Drivers on the network are in the middle of three days of strikes this week, which will be followed by another three days of action later this month. Trade unions have accused Wilkinson, who retains a senior post at the DfT, of being the hatchet man driving the Southern rail dispute. He was forced to apologise after he told a public meeting last year \u201cwe have got to break\u201d train drivers and warned that those who resisted government plans should \u201cget the hell out of my industry\u201d. In June 2014, while Wilkinson was franchising director, he was also involved in awarding a 15-year franchise, Essex Thameside, to National Express-owned c2c. The operator said it had paid for the services of FCP in the past, but not while Wilkinson was in charge of awarding franchises between January 2013 and October 2014. When asked to state the last time it used FCP, c2c did not respond. Whitehall documents obtained by the Guardian under freedom of information legislation show that in January 2013, Wilkinson declared he was a director of FCP and owned shares in the company. He said he was \u201cstepping aside from the firm for the duration of this DfT role\u201d. He believed there was a \u201crisk of perceived conflict of interest, but should not be one in practice\u201d. In August 2014, however, DfT officials concluded that Wilkinson had a clear conflict of interest between his shares in FCP and his government work. After a discussion with the department\u2019s ethics and propriety team, an official wrote that the arrangement in which he was seconded from FCP \u201cfeels very uncomfortable\u201d. In October 2014, Wilkinson stepped down as a director of FCP and was forced to sell all his shares, cutting his ties with the consultancy. At that time, he had accepted another job at the DfT. He is paid \u00a3265,000 a year as the department\u2019s managing director of rail passenger services, responsible for the national franchising strategy and all aspects of procurement. Wilkinson and the government also face questions about payments made by the DfT to FCP while he was franchising director. Official data shows that the DfT made 31 payments worth a total of \u00a3805,422 to FCP between February 2013 and October 2014. At least 12 of these payments, amounting to \u00a3356,535, related to what the department called \u201crail franchising\u201d, the area of the ministry for which Wilkinson had responsibility. When Wilkinson was employed as a contractor between January 2013 and October 2014, the DfT said, his contract included strict procedures to prevent conflicts of interest, while FCP implemented measures to ensure that any conflicts of interest were avoided. The department said there were tight controls in place to prevent any conflict of interest when payments were made to FCP. A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cThe department regularly contracts and recruits people with relevant industry and commercial expertise, to help it achieve the best result for passengers and taxpayers. We have robust safeguards to guard against any conflicts of interest. \u201cDecisions on franchise awards are taken by the department following a fair and open competition. Each franchise award is subject to thorough and independent audit.\u201d Wilkinson did not comment. According to the DfT, Wilkinson was recruited after an open and fair competition to start work at short notice as franchising director, initially for six months, with the aim of kickstarting a faltering franchising programme. According to the DfT, his long career in the rail industry had included work on the privatisation of British Rail and leading negotiations on both sides of franchising. GTR said it had regularly employed the services of FCP since 2005 at an annual fee of about \u00a318,000. A spokeswoman said it had paid FCP more than \u00a310,000 for general consultancy services between September and November 2013, adding \u201cthis would have been the time when we were working on our bid [for the franchise]\u201d. Govia is partly owned by France\u2019s train operator, Keolis, which is 70% owned by the state railway company SNCF. FCP also lists Keolis as a client. The Guardian asked Keolis when it had used FCP, but the company declined to answer, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on the detail of any commercial relationships.\u201d FCP said it could not answer questions about clients because it was bound by strict confidentiality. \u201cOur work is wide ranging and we have always maintained comprehensive confidentiality and conflict of interest processes with all our clients, in line with public procurement rules,\u201d a spokesman said. After Wilkinson\u2019s appointment as a permanent civil servant in October 2014, \u201che resigned from First Class Partnerships Ltd and our shareholders bought back his shares,\u201d the spokesman added. Wilkinson apologised for comments he made to a public meeting in south London organised by a Conservative MP to discuss the railways in February last year. He told the meeting: \u201cOver the next three years, we\u2019re going to be having punch-ups and we will see industrial action, and I want your support.\u201d He said train drivers were well paid. \u201cI\u2019m furious about it and it has got to change \u2013 we have got to break them. They have all borrowed money to buy cars and got credit cards,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford to spend too long on strike and I will push them into that place. They will have to decide if they want to give a good service or get the hell out of my industry.\u201d If you would like to pass on information in confidence, you can send a message via the Guardian\u2019s SecureDrop service (see how here).",
