      "bodyText": "The accountancy firm behind the leaked memo that claimed the government had no Brexit strategy had been working in Whitehall helping to set up David Davis\u2019s Brexit department. Deloitte, along with seven other consultancy firms, worked on a short-term contract within the Department for Exiting the EU. In the wake of the critical memo being leaked, Theresa May dismissed it as \u201cproduced by an individual from an external accountancy firm, who was not working for government\u201d. Deloitte, however, had been hired along with other consultancy firms \u2013 on a pro-bono basis, or for a nominal fee of \u00a31 \u2013 to help set up DExEU after it was created last summer. The group was charged with internal financial planning, which means it was helping the department to sort out its budgets and so had knowledge of much of its planned work. Consultants often undertake early Whitehall work for little or no fee to be better positioned for winning more lucrative contracts later. The Deloitte memo, dated 7 November and leaked later that month, claimed there were cabinet-level splits over the UK\u2019s negotiating strategy and said an additional 30,000 civil servants would be required to deal with the UK\u2019s departure from the EU. In response to the leak, and to make peace with furious ministers, Deloitte agreed to not bid for Whitehall work for six months and said it had \u201cput forward a plan [to government] \u2026 to put this matter behind us\u201d. However, the revelation that Deloitte had actually been working for the Brexit department prompted an angry response from leave and remain camps. Leave supporters said Deloitte had failed to respect the privacy of its client, while remainers said it proved criticisms of the Brexit process contained in the memo were well-founded. Richard Bacon, the senior Conservative on the Public Accounts Committee, questioned Deloitte\u2019s suitability to work on Brexit and the number of consultants hired by the department. The senior Brexiteer accused Deloitte of \u201ca certain chutzpah\u201d for \u201cdumping on the government\u2019s approach\u201d. He added: \u201cThe government will have to consider very carefully whether this firm is really in a suitable position to receive future Brexit-related work.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, who campaigned for remain, said: \u201cThis blows out of the water the idea that Deloitte does not have any idea about the Brexit process and the department\u2019s working. \u201cDeloitte have been \u2018sin binned\u2019 for six months as a result of that memo, but surely they have expertise that would be helpful.\u201d A Deloitte spokesman said: \u201cThis was a two-and-a-half week project supporting the new department on its initial financial plans and budget needs and that work has now ended.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the EU said: \u201cAs you would expect, the government is utilising the skills of the brightest and best across the civil service as we prepare to exit the EU. \u201cIt is also quite standard for a government department to draw on the advice of external specialists and we make no apology for that. We will continue to bring in expertise from outside as appropriate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Guy Ryder is an old hand at Davos. The director general of the International Labour Organisation has seen it all: the years when the global business elite is brimful of confidence and the years, such as 2017, when the top 1% of the top 1% is fretful. Ryder detected parallels with 2009, when the global economy seemed to be heading for a second Great Depression. Eight years ago, the attendees were shaken by the banking collapse but showed little contrition. This year, they were alarmed by the populist anger that was evident in Brexit and Donald Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House but couldn\u2019t really understand why it was happening. \u201cThe global elite has been saying all week that the public doesn\u2019t really understand all the good things they are doing for it,\u201d Ryder says. He is quite right about that. The 2017 Davos was a classic example of how people can be, at one and the same time, very bright and utterly obtuse. There were two distinct camps. In the first group were the really dumb ones: those who think that what happened in 2016 was an aberration and that globalisation will be back on track as soon as voters in advanced countries come to their senses. In the second camp were those \u2013 the policymakers rather than the chief executives of the big multinational corporations \u2013 who understand that the only way to save global capitalism is to reform it in a fundamental way, just as it was after the economic horrors of the 1930s. This second group has sniffed the way the wind is blowing. Studies have shown that technological change rather than trade has been responsible for the vast majority of the jobs lost in manufacturing in the developed world. Put simply, machines have replaced humans. Robots have taken over factories. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) mean a second wave of change is approaching \u2013 and this time the jobs at risk from the machines are going to be jobs in the service sector. As Dhaval Joshi, economist at BCA Research, has noted, it is not going to be the low-paid jobs in the service sector such as cleaning, gardening, carers, bar staff or cooks, whose jobs are most at risk. That\u2019s because machines find it hard to replicate the movements of humans in everyday tasks. \u201cThe hard problems that are easy for AI are those that require the application of complex algorithms and pattern recognition to large quantities of data \u2013 such as beating a grandmaster at chess\u201d, says Joshi. \u201cOr a job such as calculating a credit score or insurance premium, translating a report from English to Mandarin Chinese, or managing a stock portfolio.\u201d Seen in this light, the looming threat is obvious. The first army of machines wiped out well-paid jobs in manufacturing; the second army is about to wipe out well-paid jobs in the service sector. In many cases, the people who will be surplus to requirements will have spent many years in school and university building up their skills. Humans are still more innovative and entrepreneurial than machines, which means there will be rich rewards for the creative. They will be few in number, however, so the dynamic of recent years \u2013 exceptionally high rewards for those at the top, a hollowing out of the middle class, and the expansion of low-paid insecure jobs at the bottom \u2013 will not just continue but become more pronounced. This fourth industrial revolution, just like all the others, will lead to a growth spurt. But the last big epoch of technological change was accompanied by political change that ensured those making the cars, the washing machines and the TV sets could also buy them. Full employment policies, capital controls, progressive income tax and strong trade unions ensured this was the case. In Davos last week, one of Trump\u2019s advisers, Anthony Scaramucci, made the point that Henry Ford was a ruthless, rich capitalist but he understood that there was no point in churning out cars that his workforce could not afford to buy. There was, however, not much evidence that the bankers, the oil company executives and the Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs were listening. They know they are supposed to wring their hands about inequality and to say that something must be done to stem the tide of populism but they are not prepared to countenance anything that might help, such as higher minimum wages, more collective bargaining, higher taxes to pay for an expansion of education and training, and greater redistribution. It was not all bad news. Prof Guy Standing said that after years of being ignored he had found that concerns about the impact of automation meant plenty of interest in the idea of a basic income to be paid to all citizens and paid for by rentier capitalists. \u201cThe returns to property, intellectual property and natural resources are going to a tiny majority and we must do something about that.\u201d The World Economic Forum, the body that runs Davos, is also trying to get its members to rethink the idea that all will be well, provided nothing is done to meddle with market forces. In its Inclusive Growth and Development Report, the WEF noted it was not much of a success to have an expanding economy if all the fruits of growth were going to the few and not the many. \u201cThe ultimate objective of national economic performance is broad-based and sustained progress in living standards, a concept that encompasses wage and non-wage income (eg pension benefits) as well as economic security and quality of life\u201d. Noting that median incomes in 26 advanced countries fell by 2.4% between 2008 and 2013, the report added: \u201cMany countries have had difficulty in satisfying expectations in this regard.\u201d The WEF\u2019s argument is that the ecosystem that once ensured growth was translated into higher living standards has deteriorated as a result of technological change, global integration, domestic deregulation and increased immigration. It has a comprehensive list of remedies, including fair and efficient taxes to ensure adequate investment in education and physical infrastructure, action to tackle corruption and the concentration of rents, an adherence to core labour standard and worker protections. Instead of ranking countries by GDP, the WEF has created an inclusive development index. Surprise, surprise; those countries that do well tend to have higher taxes, generous welfare systems and a stronger role for organised labour. Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Iceland, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands fill the top seven places. Britain comes 21st, the US 23rd. Judging by last week\u2019s Davos, things will have to get worse before the WEF\u2019s warning is heeded. But as the masters of the universe clambered into their helicopters last Friday watching Trump\u2019s inauguration in Washington on their smartphones, they ought to have been smart enough to figure out that they just did.",

Telling them to switch off this desire has never worked and is unlikely to do so now, even when the future of the planet is at stake. In this vein, the accession of Donald Trump to the presidential throne should not be read as a spectacular one-off reaction by a narrow, if electorally important group who missed out on GDP growth. Consumption is how most people measure progress, and that will still be the case next year and in 10 years\u2019 time, when Trump is long gone. Take a look at the figures for flights in and out of the UK, home of some the world\u2019s busiest airports. City Airport, which is embarking on a \u00a3344m expansion, saw 4.3 million passengers in 2015. Heathrow, which has the government\u2019s blessing for its own multibillion-pound development, welcomed 75 million passengers in the same year, Gatwick broke 40 million, and Stansted hit double-digit growth with 22.5 million passengers. Last year, Manchester airport boasted annual growth of 11% after it attracted 23.7 million passengers. And these figures don\u2019t include the huge amount of imported and exported goods that flow through Britain\u2019s airports. If it\u2019s true that trade is in the UK\u2019s DNA \u2013 and the figures support this \u2013 any government, of whatever colour, will think twice before standing in the way of airport expansion. That doesn\u2019t mean governments should not think about air travel when searching for ways to tackle climate change. Aircraft makers should be forced to make their planes more efficient, and airport owners must clean up the pollution they create. But this is an exercise in minimising the impact of flying, given that its expansion is inevitable. The same analysis should have applied to the country\u2019s steel plants \u2013and to its other polluting industries. Without a reduction in steel consumption, we must live with its continued production. Does anyone believe that when Anglesey\u2019s aluminium smelter closed in 2009, and Lynemouth\u2019s in 2011, that the UK stopped using aluminium? Did it help reduce global warming for these operations to be transferred to less- regulated countries outside Europe, and for aluminium to join the long list of imported items? The Anglesey plant was the biggest employer in north Wales when it closed. It meant the end of almost 400 jobs directly, and thousands of other ancillary ones in the region. This was largely the European Union\u2019s doing and was typical of a \u201csee no evil, hear no evil\u201d policy that meant if the activity was outside the EU\u2019s borders that was fine. The EU was clean and met its targets. That\u2019s not to say schemes to cut emissions from steel and aluminium plants \u2013 and to reduce electricity consumption \u2013 are a waste of time. It\u2019s just that a realistic assessment shows they are incremental and take many years to implement. And if these activities stay in the UK, the process can be monitored and implemented properly. So the answer must be to reduce emissions elsewhere \u2013 relying on technological solutions rather than calls for abstinence. Take transport,for example. Undoubtedly, the Jeremy Clarkson brigade will go on obsessing for some time about the combustion engine and how much horsepower their motor can generate. For most people, though, the car is a means to get from A to B at the time of their choosing and in comfort. And few people obsess about trucks; they are just utility vehicles. So encouraging drivers to swap their combustion engine for an electric engine creates minimal friction between consumers and government. There were only about two million electric cars on the world\u2019s roads at the end of 2016 \u2013 which is just 1% of the market in Europe and China. But with the environment movement behind it, cheaper models with longer ranges in the pipeline and cities cracking down on air pollution, more electric vehicles will take to the roads. Electric cars can look the same as today\u2019s models \u2013 or they can be much more futuristic. They can also continue to be an object of conspicuous consumption, which campaigners will have to accept, aiming to encourage the use of eco-transport and not enforce some form of back-to-nature socialism via the back door. Electric vehicles, powered by solar generators, could reduce transport emissions to zero in tropical countries, which currently account for 40% of the world\u2019s population and will account for 55% by 2050. There are also effective ways to reduce the impact of air conditioning in these countries \u2013 and to encourage home insulation in much of the northern hemisphere. Friction, or more precisely the lack of it, should be the watchword as a guide to what is achievable and what is not. Too many environmentalists have failed to learn this lesson.",

Analysts believe there is little political will to block the deal, which failed last time amid the phone-hacking scandal. On Thursday, Sky will report its first results since the latest Fox move was announced, and the City will be looking at its customer numbers \u2013 especially the number leaving versus the number joining \u2013 as well as its performance in Germany and Italy.

    "webTitle": "Hurrah for the industrial strategy. At last Britain has a plan", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The government is this week scheduled to unveil its industrial strategy for Britain. It promises to be a fascinating document. Although this industrial strategy has received far less publicity than Brexit, it could have a more significant long-term impact on Britain then leaving the European Union. But that impact depends on the government not only producing a substantial plan but also sticking to it over years and parliaments, which will not be an easy task. Until Theresa May made her speech on Brexit last week, there were growing fears in the business world that the industrial strategy could be a damp squib. It is understood that there have been splits within government about how detailed the industrial strategy should be \u2013 because of fears that it could show Britain\u2019s hand too early in negotiations with the EU on Brexit. So while Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, understandably wanted to produce a weighty plan, those in the department for exiting the European Union were wary about the government telling the world which industries it considers most important. In her speech, the prime minister said not only that Britain intended to leave the single market, but that she wanted the country to be a cheerleader for global free trade \u2013 and she cited key sectors for this, including car manufacturing and financial services. By outlining Britain\u2019s approach to Brexit negotiations, May gave the industrial strategy a platform to build on. The contents of the strategy are likely to focus on what sectors the government believes have potential, how they will be supported, and how it intends to develop skills, infrastructure and research and development. The prime minister established the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy soon after she succeeded David Cameron in July. That move in itself was a notable step away from Cameron\u2019s approach. Sajid Javid, Cameron\u2019s business secretary, had expressed his dislike for government intervention and avoided the phrase industrial strategy altogether. His argument was that industries and companies who were not part of the strategy felt isolated. Nonetheless, almost nine out of 10 business leaders surveyed by the influential Institute of Directors (IoD) said that they were in favour of an industrial strategy. Javid\u2019s predecessors in the role of business secretary, Lord Mandelson and Sir Vince Cable, both happily adopted the concept. Although their industrial strategies were never put into writing, they formed task forces in the automotive and aerospace sectors made up of government figures and industry leaders. These so-called councils allowed the government to communicate regularly with chief executives in sectors it considered important, and to develop joint policies. It should be remembered that Javid\u2019s laissez-faire approach ended in a tangle when he was forced to step in and offer financial support for the steel industry as thousands of jobs hung on the line. Clark used to work for Boston Consulting Group, so drawing up a strategy should not be a problem for him. He has already provided clues about areas the industrial strategy will focus on. Last September, Clark told the IoD conference in London that the industrial strategy had to focus on local areas and that \u201cfor too long government policy has treated everywhere like it is identical\u201d. He added: \u201cMany of the policies and decisions that form our industrial strategy will not be about particular industries or sectors, but will be cross-cutting.\u201d Then, in November, he said at a speech at Jaguar Land Rover that making Britain a world-leading hub for next-generation electric vehicles would be at the heart of the new strategy. He described the automotive sector, particularly electric vehicles, driverless cars and battery storage, as an \u201cemblematic area of focus\u201d. We will find out this week how Clark and the government plan to electrify the economy. Even if the industrial strategy is just one page long, it will provide more clarity than Javid offered. SFO has done a good job on Rolls-Royce. But it shouldn\u2019t stop there Apart from the banks, it is hard to think of a bigger British corporate scandal than Rolls-Royce in the past two decades. If Brexit and Trump weren\u2019t happening, the tale of bribery and corruption at Rolls-Royce over three decades would have been front-page news for days. To recap: a company long deemed one of the UK\u2019s finest agreed to pay \u00a3671m in penalties via a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Serious Fraud Office and parallel agreements in Brazil and the US. Rolls-Royce\u2019s behaviour amounted to \u201cegregious criminality,\u201d according to the senior judge who approved the agreement. Sir Brian Leveson\u2019s comments and the statement of facts were admirably clear on what happened \u2013 such as the handing of $2.25m and a Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit car to an individual in Indonesia in exchange for a \u201cfavour to Rolls-Royce\u201d \u2013 but silent on who was responsible. The silence was because individuals could still be prosecuted. But note one aggravating feature described by Leveson: \u201cThe conduct involved senior (on the face of it, very senior) Rolls-Royce employees.\u201d In another passage, the lawbreaking was said to implicate \u201csenior management and, on the face of it, controlling minds of the company\u201d. The obvious question is whether any prosecutions will materialise. Due process must be followed, of course. But public confidence in DPAs \u2013 used by the SFO since 2013 \u2013 will be maintained only if they are not seen as allowing a company to make a legal problem go away by writing a large cheque. For Rolls-Royce \u2013 whose board was praised for its full cooperation with the SFO \u2013 that must mean one of two outcomes. Either the relevant senior managers should be prosecuted where possible; or the SFO must provide compelling reasons why not. A fudged outcome, in which the question of individual prosecutions is perpetually delayed, would undermine faith in DPAs. The SFO was rightly praised last week for securing the settlement, but its work is not finished. Some of the things Soros says have to come true George Soros, hedge fund speculator extraordinaire, has not become a star turn in Davos by being dull. His current opinions, shared with the gilded set at the Swiss shindig, were suitably bold. Donald Trump is a \u201cwould-be dictator\u201d who is \u201cgoing to fail\u201d. Theresa May \u201cwill not last\u201d and British people are \u201cin denial\u201d about the cost of Brexit. Financial markets will \u201cnot do very well\u201d. He may well turn out to be right in some or all of his views. But timing in markets is everything, as Soros, who made a fortune by betting against the pound on Black Wednesday in 1992, knows. A week after the UK referendum, he said the result had \u201cunleashed a crisis in the markets comparable in severity only to that of 2007-08\u201d. The squall passed and the FTSE 100 and Dow Jones are close to record highs. Never mind, Soros grabbed attention \u2013the chief requirement at Davos.",

      "body": "<p>The government is this week scheduled to unveil its industrial strategy for Britain. It promises to be a fascinating document. Although this industrial strategy has received far less publicity than Brexit, it could have a more significant long-term impact on Britain then leaving the European Union. But that impact depends on the government not only producing a substantial plan but also sticking to it over years and parliaments, which will not be an easy task.</p> <p>Until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/17/prime-minister-vows-to-put-final-brexit-deal-before-parliament\" title=\"\">Theresa May made her speech on Brexit</a> last week, there were growing fears in the business world that the industrial strategy could be a damp squib. It is understood that there have been splits within government about how detailed the industrial strategy should be \u2013 because of fears that it could show Britain\u2019s hand too early in negotiations with the EU on Brexit.</p> <p>So while Greg Clark, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, understandably wanted to produce a weighty plan, those in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">department for exiting the European Union</a> were wary about the government telling the world which industries it considers most important.</p> <p>In her speech, the prime minister said not only that Britain intended to leave the single market, but that she wanted the country to be a cheerleader for global free trade \u2013 and she cited key sectors for this, including car manufacturing and financial services. By outlining Britain\u2019s approach to Brexit negotiations, May gave the industrial strategy a platform to build on.</p> <p>The contents of the strategy are likely to focus on what sectors the government believes have potential, how they will be supported, and how it intends to develop skills, infrastructure and research and development.</p> <p>The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/industrial-strategy-welcomed-as-part-of-governments-new-business-policy\" title=\"\">established the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a> soon after she succeeded David Cameron in July. That move in itself was a notable step away from Cameron\u2019s approach.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a>, Cameron\u2019s business secretary, had expressed his dislike for government intervention and avoided the phrase industrial strategy altogether. His argument was that industries and companies who were not part of the strategy felt isolated.</p> <p>Nonetheless, almost nine out of 10 business leaders surveyed by the influential Institute of Directors (IoD) said that they were in favour of an industrial strategy. Javid\u2019s predecessors in the role of business secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/dec/15/let-them-eat-granola-peter-mandelson-industrial-strategy\" title=\"\">Lord Mandelson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/vincentcable\" title=\"\">Sir Vince Cable</a>, both happily adopted the concept.</p> <p>Although their industrial strategies were never put into writing, they formed task forces in the automotive and aerospace sectors made up of government figures and industry leaders. These so-called councils allowed the government to communicate regularly with chief executives in sectors it considered important, and to develop joint policies. It should be remembered that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/tata-steel-uk-boss-warns-pension-timebomb\" title=\"\">Javid\u2019s laissez-faire approach ended in a tangle when he was forced to step in and offer financial support for the steel industry as thousands of jobs hung on the line.</a></p> <p>Clark used to work for Boston Consulting Group, so drawing up a strategy should not be a problem for him. He has already provided clues about areas the industrial strategy will focus on.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/27/new-uk-industrial-strategy-greg-clark-iod\" title=\"\">Last September, Clark told the IoD conference in London that the industrial strategy had to focus on local areas and that \u201cfor too long government policy has treated everywhere like it is identical\u201d</a>. He added: \u201cMany of the policies and decisions that form our industrial strategy will not be about particular industries or sectors, but will be cross-cutting.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/25/electric-vehicles-greg-clark-jaguar-land-rover\" title=\"\">Then, in November, he said at a speech at Jaguar Land Rover that making Britain a world-leading hub for next-generation electric vehicles would be at the heart of the new strategy</a>. He described the automotive sector, particularly electric vehicles, driverless cars and battery storage, as an \u201cemblematic area of focus\u201d.</p> <p>We will find out this week how Clark and the government plan to electrify the economy. Even if the industrial strategy is just one page long, it will provide more clarity than Javid offered.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3f763b2c853b1dab1dc302daf475eeedff019ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3f763b2c853b1dab1dc302daf475eeedff019ac/0_64_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rolls-Royce employee working on a jet engine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rolls-Royce: a tarnished brand?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolls Royce/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>SFO has done a good job on Rolls-Royce.
