      "body": "<p>More than \u00a350m of World Food Programme aid to feed the starving has ended up in the hands of a London-listed commodities trader run by billionaires, despite a pledge by the United Nations agency to buy food from \"very poor farmers\".</p> <p>Glencore International, which buys up supplies from farmers and sells them on at a profit, was the biggest single supplier of wheat to the WFP over the last eight months, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>Glencore, which was able to operate with secrecy from its base in Baar, Switzerland, until it floated on the London stock exchange last May, is expected on Tuesday to announce a merger with mining group Xstrata to become one of the 10 biggest FTSE 100 companies with a market value of more than \u00a350bn.</p> <p>Details of the dealings with Glencore, which controls 8% of the global wheat market, emerged a year after the head of the WFP committed to buying food from local farmers.</p> <p>\"Our new motto is to help people feed themselves,\" Josette Sheeran, the executive director of the WFP, <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-10/14/c_13556984.htm\" title=\"\">told China's state news agency</a>. \"When we can, we purchase our food from the very poor farmers who suffer because they are not connected to local markets.\"</p> <p>Raj Patel, an economist expert in the global food trade and former UN employee, said it was shocking how much food aid money was \"funnelling to one of the largest commodity traders\".</p> <p>The rising price of wheat has squeezed the incomes of millions of the world's poorest people. Many have been forced to turn to the WFP, which last year fed more than 90 million people in 73 countries.</p> <p>Over the last eight months Glencore has sold wheat worth $78m (\u00a350m) to the WFP, according to <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/procurement/food-tender-awards/2011\" title=\"\">details of contracts published on the agency's website</a>.</p> <p>In the biggest single deal, the WFP bought $22.5m of Glencore wheat in July last year to feed Ethiopians in one the worst famines in recent memory. The WFP also bought Glencore wheat, sorghum and yellow split peas for Kenya, Djibouti, Bangladesh, Sudan, North Korea and Palestine. Last month the WFP spent $10.8m on wheat for drought-stricken Djibouti.</p> <p>In its latest half-year financial results Glencore, which previously attracted controversy for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/sep/07/glencore-fatalities-environmental-fines-record\" title=\"\">environmental breaches</a> and accusations of dealing with rogue states, including Iraq under Saddam Hussein<strong>,</strong> reported that revenue from agricultural products doubled to $8.8bn. The company said its performance had been \"driven by stronger profits in grains and oil seeds\" for which \"prices were substantially higher in H1 [the first half of] 2011 compared to H1 2010\".</p> <p>The company said: \"There were increased geographic arbitrage opportunities [buying commodities cheaper in order to sell them on later at a higher price] available in wheat and edible oils.\" It said the average wheat price of a bushel [8 gallons] of wheat increased by 60% over the previous year to $778.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the WFP said: \"As a humanitarian agency that depends entirely on voluntary donations we always aim to get the most competitive price when purchasing food on the open markets. Rising food prices do have an impact on our budget and they can be driven up by any number of factors, including speculation.\"</p> <p>Glencore said it won the WFP tenders because \"we were able to offer the commodities needed at the lowest possible price\".</p> <p>Rob Bailey, a senior research fellow in food security at Chatham House in London, said the WFP often buys from traders such as Glencore, Cargill and Viterra, because food donations are not available and local farmers cannot provide the quantities needed. \"It is concerning that the World Food Programme is left at the whim of international markets precisely when prices are high,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Such crisis periods of high volatility are also when the big traders make the most money, because they have the best information on likely supply and demand and how markets are going to evolve, allowing them to take positions in the market to turn profits.\"</p> <p>John Hilary, the executive director of the War on Want, said: \"Glencore's self-confessed speculation on grain markets last year forced up prices at a time of world shortage, driving more people into extreme hunger. The WFP needs to rethink its priorities and support local markets rather than corporate giants such as Glencore.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/15/healthmindandbody.health\" title=\"\">Patel, the author of Stuffed and Starved: Markets, Power and the Hidden Battle for the World's Food System</a>, said: \"It's a shocking amount of money to be funnelling to one of the largest commodity traders. That financial entities are now making their presence felt \u2013 and Glencore is among the most powerful of these new corporations \u2013 points to the increasing financialisation of food in the 21st century.\"</p> <p>Glencore admitted that it bet on a rising wheat price after drought in Russia, according to investment bank UBS. \"[Glencore's] agricultural team received very timely reports from Russia farm assets that growing conditions were deteriorating aggressively in the spring and summer of 2010, as the Russian drought set in \u2026 This put it in a position to make proprietary trades going long on wheat and corn,\" UBS said in a report to potential investors, disclosed by the Financial Times.</p> <p>On 3 August 2010 the head of Glencore's Russian grain business, Yury Ognev, urged Moscow to ban grain exports, according to the UBS report.<strong> </strong>Two days later Russian authorities banned wheat exports, which forced prices up by 15% in two days.</p> <p>On Monday Glencore said UBS's account of its role in the Russian grain crisis was \"simply untrue. In any case, the export ban did not help our business\".</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"We share the view that financial speculation in agricultural products markets can be harmful. Our business is physical \u2013 we produce, buy, store and blend agricultural commodities.</p> <p>\"We bridge the gap between harvests that last for a couple of weeks and demand which is fairly constant throughout the year.</p> <p>\"Because we are physical holders, we are always net sellers in the agricultural products futures markets which actually has a downward effect on the prices of agricultural products futures.\"</p> <p>Glencore's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, earned the moniker \"the $10 billion man\" when his stake was valued at \u00a35.76bn at last May's flotation. Four other partners \u2013 Daniel Mat\u00e9, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and Alex Beard \u2013 were also made paper billionaires. More than <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/about/donors/year/2011\" title=\"\">$3.6bn was given to the WFP last year</a>, with the US contributing $1.2bn and the UK \u00a3144m.</p> <h2>Merger deal anticipated<br></h2> <p>Glencore is on Tuesday expected to announce plans to merge with mining group Xstrata to become one of the 10 biggest companies listed on the London stock market. It will be the latest move in Glencore's journey from secretive trading house founded by Marc Rich, a commodities traderwho was charged by US authorities with selling oil to Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, to global powerhouse in the sale of commodities from copper and coal to sugar and wheat.</p> <p>The largest shareholder in the combined company \u2013 dubbed Glenstrata \u2013 will be Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's multibillionaire chief executive. But Glasenberg, who makes so much money he <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/swiss-village-wins-tax-break-thanks-to-billionaire-6273681.html\" title=\"\">indirectly funded a generous Christmas tax break for the other residents of the Swiss village where he lives,</a> is understood to be planning to step aside to become deputy to Mick \"the miner\" Davis, the head of Xstrata.</p> <p>Davis, already one the highest paid executives in the FTSE 100, is likely to be offered a \"golden handcuffs\" deal to stay at the company. A change of control clause could also see Davis collect an additional \u00a310.7m in long-term shares.</p> <p>The deal is likely to see Glencore pay about an 8% premium to buy up the Xstrata shares it does not already own.</p> <p>Sir John Bond, Xstrata's chairman and a former chair of HSBC and Vodafone, will lead the Glenstrata board, while Glencore's chairman Simon Murray, who has been attacked for his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/24/glencore-simon-murray-women-in-boardrooms\" title=\"\">\"unbelievably primitive\" views on women in business</a>, is likely to step aside.</p> <p>Tony Hayward, the former boss of BP, is likely to be appointed the senior independent director of the combined company, which will have more than 120,000 staff across five continents.</p>",

Glencore, which was able to operate with secrecy from its base in Baar, Switzerland, until it floated on the London stock exchange last May, is expected on Tuesday to announce a merger with mining group Xstrata to become one of the 10 biggest FTSE 100 companies with a market value of more than \u00a350bn. Details of the dealings with Glencore, which controls 8% of the global wheat market, emerged a year after the head of the WFP committed to buying food from local farmers. \"Our new motto is to help people feed themselves,\" Josette Sheeran, the executive director of the WFP, told China's state news agency. \"When we can, we purchase our food from the very poor farmers who suffer because they are not connected to local markets.\" Raj Patel, an economist expert in the global food trade and former UN employee, said it was shocking how much food aid money was \"funnelling to one of the largest commodity traders\". The rising price of wheat has squeezed the incomes of millions of the world's poorest people. Many have been forced to turn to the WFP, which last year fed more than 90 million people in 73 countries. Over the last eight months Glencore has sold wheat worth $78m (\u00a350m) to the WFP, according to details of contracts published on the agency's website. In the biggest single deal, the WFP bought $22.5m of Glencore wheat in July last year to feed Ethiopians in one the worst famines in recent memory. The WFP also bought Glencore wheat, sorghum and yellow split peas for Kenya, Djibouti, Bangladesh, Sudan, North Korea and Palestine. Last month the WFP spent $10.8m on wheat for drought-stricken Djibouti. In its latest half-year financial results Glencore, which previously attracted controversy for environmental breaches and accusations of dealing with rogue states, including Iraq under Saddam Hussein, reported that revenue from agricultural products doubled to $8.8bn. The company said its performance had been \"driven by stronger profits in grains and oil seeds\" for which \"prices were substantially higher in H1 [the first half of] 2011 compared to H1 2010\". The company said: \"There were increased geographic arbitrage opportunities [buying commodities cheaper in order to sell them on later at a higher price] available in wheat and edible oils.\" It said the average wheat price of a bushel [8 gallons] of wheat increased by 60% over the previous year to $778. A spokeswoman for the WFP said: \"As a humanitarian agency that depends entirely on voluntary donations we always aim to get the most competitive price when purchasing food on the open markets. Rising food prices do have an impact on our budget and they can be driven up by any number of factors, including speculation.\" Glencore said it won the WFP tenders because \"we were able to offer the commodities needed at the lowest possible price\". Rob Bailey, a senior research fellow in food security at Chatham House in London, said the WFP often buys from traders such as Glencore, Cargill and Viterra, because food donations are not available and local farmers cannot provide the quantities needed. \"It is concerning that the World Food Programme is left at the whim of international markets precisely when prices are high,\" he said. \"Such crisis periods of high volatility are also when the big traders make the most money, because they have the best information on likely supply and demand and how markets are going to evolve, allowing them to take positions in the market to turn profits.\" John Hilary, the executive director of the War on Want, said: \"Glencore's self-confessed speculation on grain markets last year forced up prices at a time of world shortage, driving more people into extreme hunger. The WFP needs to rethink its priorities and support local markets rather than corporate giants such as Glencore.\" Patel, the author of Stuffed and Starved: Markets, Power and the Hidden Battle for the World's Food System, said: \"It's a shocking amount of money to be funnelling to one of the largest commodity traders. That financial entities are now making their presence felt \u2013 and Glencore is among the most powerful of these new corporations \u2013 points to the increasing financialisation of food in the 21st century.\" Glencore admitted that it bet on a rising wheat price after drought in Russia, according to investment bank UBS. \"[Glencore's] agricultural team received very timely reports from Russia farm assets that growing conditions were deteriorating aggressively in the spring and summer of 2010, as the Russian drought set in \u2026 This put it in a position to make proprietary trades going long on wheat and corn,\" UBS said in a report to potential investors, disclosed by the Financial Times. On 3 August 2010 the head of Glencore's Russian grain business, Yury Ognev, urged Moscow to ban grain exports, according to the UBS report. Two days later Russian authorities banned wheat exports, which forced prices up by 15% in two days. On Monday Glencore said UBS's account of its role in the Russian grain crisis was \"simply untrue. In any case, the export ban did not help our business\". A spokesman said: \"We share the view that financial speculation in agricultural products markets can be harmful. Our business is physical \u2013 we produce, buy, store and blend agricultural commodities. \"We bridge the gap between harvests that last for a couple of weeks and demand which is fairly constant throughout the year. \"Because we are physical holders, we are always net sellers in the agricultural products futures markets which actually has a downward effect on the prices of agricultural products futures.\" Glencore's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, earned the moniker \"the $10 billion man\" when his stake was valued at \u00a35.76bn at last May's flotation. Four other partners \u2013 Daniel Mat\u00e9, Telis Mistakidis, Tor Peterson and Alex Beard \u2013 were also made paper billionaires. More than $3.6bn was given to the WFP last year, with the US contributing $1.2bn and the UK \u00a3144m. Merger deal anticipated Glencore is on Tuesday expected to announce plans to merge with mining group Xstrata to become one of the 10 biggest companies listed on the London stock market. It will be the latest move in Glencore's journey from secretive trading house founded by Marc Rich, a commodities traderwho was charged by US authorities with selling oil to Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, to global powerhouse in the sale of commodities from copper and coal to sugar and wheat. The largest shareholder in the combined company \u2013 dubbed Glenstrata \u2013 will be Ivan Glasenberg, Glencore's multibillionaire chief executive. But Glasenberg, who makes so much money he indirectly funded a generous Christmas tax break for the other residents of the Swiss village where he lives, is understood to be planning to step aside to become deputy to Mick \"the miner\" Davis, the head of Xstrata. Davis, already one the highest paid executives in the FTSE 100, is likely to be offered a \"golden handcuffs\" deal to stay at the company. A change of control clause could also see Davis collect an additional \u00a310.7m in long-term shares. The deal is likely to see Glencore pay about an 8% premium to buy up the Xstrata shares it does not already own. Sir John Bond, Xstrata's chairman and a former chair of HSBC and Vodafone, will lead the Glenstrata board, while Glencore's chairman Simon Murray, who has been attacked for his \"unbelievably primitive\" views on women in business, is likely to step aside. Tony Hayward, the former boss of BP, is likely to be appointed the senior independent director of the combined company, which will have more than 120,000 staff across five continents.",

But David Cameron will be worrying that the mob of vengeful public opinion will now race through boardroom after boardroom demanding restraint each time the media or an Opposition politician alights on a juicy pay package. Stephen Hester, the RBS chief executive, gave in last week, admitting he had misjudged the public mood. In the weeks ahead a host of bankers and semi-public sector executives in the regulated industries will face the court of public opinion as their pay packages are publicised, and scrutinised.

Tory funders are also anxious that Cameron is running scared, or even worse feeding the populist anti-business mood, coming perilously close to a national high incomes policy of the kind Labour governments used to impose on unions in the late 1970s. Michael Spencer, one of the top fundraisers for the Tories and chairman of Icap, the City broker, told the Sunday Times that the row that forced Hester to give up his \u00a31m bonus sent a negative message to the business community. \"I think the way Hester was effectively bullied out of his bonus was very negative indeed for the message it sends to the business community at large.\" It seems a long time since Britain's executives, with some covert support in the Treasury were openly agitating for an end to the 50p top rate of tax.

In a debate on Tuesday in the Commons called by Labour on banker's bonuses, do not expect Labour to probe too deeply into the criteria that should apply to executive pay. It will make a general point about the need to stop rewards for failure, call for greater transparency on pay and then propose workers on remuneration committees.

More than 20 MPs have signed a Commons motion saying Network Rail had been \"found by the Office of Rail Regulation to be in breach of its licence\" and had been responsible for \"major asset failures, congested routes and poor management of track condition\". Last week, the company admitted health and safety breaches over the deaths of two teenagers killed at a level crossing in Essex in 2005. Downing Street said ministers were not permitted to interfere in the \"day-to-day running\" of the firm, which receives \u00a34bn of taxpayer funding a year and is guaranteed by the government. But it said it would be looking at its corporate governance in the light of \"problems\" that had arisen.

      "standfirst": "Vodafone terminates plans to link up with Greece's Wind Hellas; Shire subject of renewed speculation", 
      "body": "<p>Much of the recent interest in <strong>Vodafone</strong>'s overseas businesses has revolved around India, but on Monday the focus switched to Greece.</p> <p>In a short statement the mobile phone group announced it was abandoning plans - unveiled in August - to merge its Greek business with rival Wind Hellas. It said:</p> <blockquote> Vodafone and Largo, the sold shareholder of Wind Hellas, confirm they have agreed to terminate discussions relating to a potential business combination between Vodafone and Wind Hellas. <br> </blockquote> <p>Analysts said competition concerns were probably behind the move, although Greece's current financial problems could have played a part. Espirito Santo said:</p> <blockquote> The proposal to consolidate the Greek mobile market down to two players each with around 50% market share was never likely to succeed in any case, but it was probably worth a try; it was possible that an exception could have been made given the trauma that Greece in general and Wind in particular are going through. <br> We haven't seen any official announcements regarding the reasons for the collapse of the merger from either the companies or the regulators, so we assume the regulators (Greek or EU) have told Vodafone in private discussions that this deal would not get approval. This allows Vodafone to withdraw without suffering the ignominy of public rejection.  We would now expect Vodafone to re-commit to growing its Greek business organically, which may involve some investment in subscriber growth/retention to grow its market share \u2013 a price worth paying in the short term to take advantage of Wind's troubles. </blockquote> <p>Ahead of a trading update on Thursday Vodafone climbed 2.75p to 177.85p.</p> <p>More generally, Greece was also the main subject on investors' minds once more. With little clarity about the progress - or otherwise - of talks to allow the next \u20ac130bn tranche of bailout money to the paid to the country, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> suffered a little profit taking after hitting new six month highs last week. But there was no real sense of panic, and the index closed down just 8.87 points at 5892.20.</p> <p><strong>Shire</strong> rose 19p to \u00a321.29 on renewed talk of a possible bid for the pharmaceuticals group. The company has been linked in the past with a number of predators, from Bayer to Pfizer to AstraZeneca. Traders heard suggestions this time of an offer worth perhaps \u00a335 a share.</p> <p>Still with takeover speculation, <strong>Misys</strong> climbed 5.5p to 335p hopes a bid would emerge following last week's proposal for the IT group to merge with Swiss rival Temenos. The news disappointed those hoping for a bid premium for the UK business.</p> <p><strong>Randgold Resources</strong> was among the leading risers, up 165p at \u00a375.65 after it reported a 259% jump in full year profits.</p> <p>But <strong>Glencore</strong> lost 21.8p to 460.75p on suggestions it would have to pay more to succeed in its plans for a \u00a350bn merger with <strong>Xstrata</strong>, down 21.5p at 1261.5p There were also reports the deal could face regulatory scrutiny.</p> <p>A boardroom row at coal miner<strong> Bumi</strong> sent its shares 55p lower to 795p. Indonesia's Bakrie family are attempting to oust financier Nathanial Rothschild and other directors from the board.</p> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong> fell 23p to \u00a328.87 and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong> was down 6.5p at \u00a322 on growing talk they could be about to pounce on US coal producer Walter Energy at around $125 a share. In the market Walter shares stand at around $75.</p> <p>Insure <strong>Admiral </strong>gave up some of the gains it made on Friday, falling 39.5p to 998.5p. Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas said:</p> <blockquote> Admiral's share price reacted strongly on Friday (up 7.9%) to the announcement that the reinsurance arrangements had been extended to 2014 on current terms. <br> This prompted some commentators to say that Admiral's reserving issues were in the past and that the reinsurers had audited the level of reserves. We see a key difference between the reinsurance and the shareholder risk. We do not believe the reinsurance structures will be effective in capital terms under Solvency II and therefore the extension is rather irrelevant.  We expect that Admiral's market share is in decline.

      "bodyText": "Much of the recent interest in Vodafone's overseas businesses has revolved around India, but on Monday the focus switched to Greece. In a short statement the mobile phone group announced it was abandoning plans - unveiled in August - to merge its Greek business with rival Wind Hellas. It said: Vodafone and Largo, the sold shareholder of Wind Hellas, confirm they have agreed to terminate discussions relating to a potential business combination between Vodafone and Wind Hellas. Analysts said competition concerns were probably behind the move, although Greece's current financial problems could have played a part. Espirito Santo said: The proposal to consolidate the Greek mobile market down to two players each with around 50% market share was never likely to succeed in any case, but it was probably worth a try; it was possible that an exception could have been made given the trauma that Greece in general and Wind in particular are going through. We haven't seen any official announcements regarding the reasons for the collapse of the merger from either the companies or the regulators, so we assume the regulators (Greek or EU) have told Vodafone in private discussions that this deal would not get approval. This allows Vodafone to withdraw without suffering the ignominy of public rejection. We would now expect Vodafone to re-commit to growing its Greek business organically, which may involve some investment in subscriber growth/retention to grow its market share \u2013 a price worth paying in the short term to take advantage of Wind's troubles. Ahead of a trading update on Thursday Vodafone climbed 2.75p to 177.85p. More generally, Greece was also the main subject on investors' minds once more. With little clarity about the progress - or otherwise - of talks to allow the next \u20ac130bn tranche of bailout money to the paid to the country, the FTSE 100 suffered a little profit taking after hitting new six month highs last week. But there was no real sense of panic, and the index closed down just 8.87 points at 5892.20. Shire rose 19p to \u00a321.29 on renewed talk of a possible bid for the pharmaceuticals group. The company has been linked in the past with a number of predators, from Bayer to Pfizer to AstraZeneca. Traders heard suggestions this time of an offer worth perhaps \u00a335 a share. Still with takeover speculation, Misys climbed 5.5p to 335p hopes a bid would emerge following last week's proposal for the IT group to merge with Swiss rival Temenos. The news disappointed those hoping for a bid premium for the UK business. Randgold Resources was among the leading risers, up 165p at \u00a375.65 after it reported a 259% jump in full year profits. But Glencore lost 21.8p to 460.75p on suggestions it would have to pay more to succeed in its plans for a \u00a350bn merger with Xstrata, down 21.5p at 1261.5p There were also reports the deal could face regulatory scrutiny. A boardroom row at coal miner Bumi sent its shares 55p lower to 795p. Indonesia's Bakrie family are attempting to oust financier Nathanial Rothschild and other directors from the board. Anglo American fell 23p to \u00a328.87 and BHP Billiton was down 6.5p at \u00a322 on growing talk they could be about to pounce on US coal producer Walter Energy at around $125 a share. In the market Walter shares stand at around $75. Insure Admiral gave up some of the gains it made on Friday, falling 39.5p to 998.5p. Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas said: Admiral's share price reacted strongly on Friday (up 7.9%) to the announcement that the reinsurance arrangements had been extended to 2014 on current terms. This prompted some commentators to say that Admiral's reserving issues were in the past and that the reinsurers had audited the level of reserves. We see a key difference between the reinsurance and the shareholder risk. We do not believe the reinsurance structures will be effective in capital terms under Solvency II and therefore the extension is rather irrelevant. We expect that Admiral's market share is in decline. This could lead to a decline in vehicle count in the fourth quarter. Elsewhere SuperGroup soared 41p to 703p after Oriel Securities moved from hold to buy, but Ocado dropped 4.8p to 103.5p on profit taking after last week's share price rise. Premier Foods has just started a \u00a350m advertising push, with television spots starring Loyd Grossman plugging his sauces from today.

      "body": "<p>Nothing illustrates better the political crosscurrents, special interests, and shortsighted economics now at play in Europe than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/feb/06/greece-bailout-talks-eurozone-debt-crisis\" title=\"\">the debate over the restructuring of Greece's sovereign debt</a>. Germany insists on a deep restructuring \u2013 at least a 50% \"haircut\" for bondholders \u2013 whereas the European Central Bank insists that any debt restructuring must be voluntary.</p> <p>In the old days \u2013 think of the 1980s Latin American debt crisis \u2013 one could get creditors, mostly large banks, in a small room, and hammer out a deal, aided by some cajoling, or even arm-twisting, by governments and regulators eager for things to go smoothly. But, with the advent of debt securitisation, creditors have become far more numerous, and include hedge funds and other investors over whom regulators and governments have little sway.</p> <p>Moreover, \"innovation\" in financial markets has made it possible for securities owners to be insured, meaning that they have a seat at the table, but no \"skin in the game\". They do have interests: they want to collect on their insurance, and that means that the restructuring must be a \"credit event\" \u2013 tantamount to a default. The ECB's insistence on \"voluntary\" restructuring \u2013 that is, avoidance of a credit event \u2013 has placed the two sides at loggerheads. The irony is that the regulators have allowed the creation of this dysfunctional system.</p> <p>The ECB's stance is peculiar. One would have hoped that the banks might have managed the default risk on the bonds in their portfolios by buying insurance. And, if they bought insurance, a regulator concerned with systemic stability would want to be sure that the insurer pays in the event of a loss. But the ECB wants the banks to suffer a 50% loss on their bond holdings, without insurance \"benefits\" having to be paid.</p> <p>There are three explanations for the ECB's position, none of which speaks well for the institution and its regulatory and supervisory conduct. The first explanation is that the banks have not, in fact, bought insurance, and some have taken speculative positions. The second is that the ECB knows that the financial system lacks transparency \u2013 and knows that investors are aware that they cannot gauge the impact of an involuntary default, which could cause credit markets to freeze, reprising the aftermath of Lehman Brothers' collapse in September 2008. Finally, the ECB may be trying to protect the few banks that have written the insurance.</p> <p>None of these explanations is an adequate excuse for the ECB's opposition to deep involuntary restructuring of Greece's debt. The ECB should have insisted on more transparency \u2013 indeed, that should have been one of the main lessons of 2008. Regulators should not have allowed the banks to speculate as they did; if anything, they should have required them to buy insurance \u2013 and then insisted on restructuring in a way that ensured that the insurance paid off.</p> <p>There is, moreover, little evidence that a deep involuntary restructuring would be any more traumatic than a deep voluntary restructuring. By insisting on it being voluntary, the ECB may be trying to ensure that the restructuring is not deep; but, in that case, it is putting the banks' interests before that of Greece, for which a deep restructuring is essential if it is to emerge from the crisis. In fact, the ECB may be putting the interests of the few banks that have written credit-default swaps before those of Greece, Europe's taxpayers, and creditors who acted prudently and bought insurance.</p> <p>The final oddity of the ECB's stance concerns democratic governance. Deciding whether a credit event has occurred is left to a secret committee of the <a href=\"http://www2.isda.org/\" title=\"\">International Swaps and Derivatives Association</a>, an industry group that has a vested interest in the outcome. If news reports are correct, some members of the committee have been using their position to promote more accommodative negotiating positions.

      "bodyText": "Nothing illustrates better the political crosscurrents, special interests, and shortsighted economics now at play in Europe than the debate over the restructuring of Greece's sovereign debt. Germany insists on a deep restructuring \u2013 at least a 50% \"haircut\" for bondholders \u2013 whereas the European Central Bank insists that any debt restructuring must be voluntary. In the old days \u2013 think of the 1980s Latin American debt crisis \u2013 one could get creditors, mostly large banks, in a small room, and hammer out a deal, aided by some cajoling, or even arm-twisting, by governments and regulators eager for things to go smoothly. But, with the advent of debt securitisation, creditors have become far more numerous, and include hedge funds and other investors over whom regulators and governments have little sway. Moreover, \"innovation\" in financial markets has made it possible for securities owners to be insured, meaning that they have a seat at the table, but no \"skin in the game\". They do have interests: they want to collect on their insurance, and that means that the restructuring must be a \"credit event\" \u2013 tantamount to a default. The ECB's insistence on \"voluntary\" restructuring \u2013 that is, avoidance of a credit event \u2013 has placed the two sides at loggerheads. The irony is that the regulators have allowed the creation of this dysfunctional system. The ECB's stance is peculiar. One would have hoped that the banks might have managed the default risk on the bonds in their portfolios by buying insurance. And, if they bought insurance, a regulator concerned with systemic stability would want to be sure that the insurer pays in the event of a loss. But the ECB wants the banks to suffer a 50% loss on their bond holdings, without insurance \"benefits\" having to be paid. There are three explanations for the ECB's position, none of which speaks well for the institution and its regulatory and supervisory conduct. The first explanation is that the banks have not, in fact, bought insurance, and some have taken speculative positions. The second is that the ECB knows that the financial system lacks transparency \u2013 and knows that investors are aware that they cannot gauge the impact of an involuntary default, which could cause credit markets to freeze, reprising the aftermath of Lehman Brothers' collapse in September 2008. Finally, the ECB may be trying to protect the few banks that have written the insurance. None of these explanations is an adequate excuse for the ECB's opposition to deep involuntary restructuring of Greece's debt. The ECB should have insisted on more transparency \u2013 indeed, that should have been one of the main lessons of 2008. Regulators should not have allowed the banks to speculate as they did; if anything, they should have required them to buy insurance \u2013 and then insisted on restructuring in a way that ensured that the insurance paid off. There is, moreover, little evidence that a deep involuntary restructuring would be any more traumatic than a deep voluntary restructuring. By insisting on it being voluntary, the ECB may be trying to ensure that the restructuring is not deep; but, in that case, it is putting the banks' interests before that of Greece, for which a deep restructuring is essential if it is to emerge from the crisis. In fact, the ECB may be putting the interests of the few banks that have written credit-default swaps before those of Greece, Europe's taxpayers, and creditors who acted prudently and bought insurance. The final oddity of the ECB's stance concerns democratic governance. Deciding whether a credit event has occurred is left to a secret committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, an industry group that has a vested interest in the outcome. If news reports are correct, some members of the committee have been using their position to promote more accommodative negotiating positions. But it seems unconscionable that the ECB would delegate to a secret committee of self-interested market participants the right to determine what is an acceptable debt restructuring. The one argument that seems, at least superficially, to put the public interest first is that an involuntary restructuring might lead to financial contagion, with large eurozone economies such as Italy, Spain, and even France facing a sharp, and perhaps prohibitive, rise in borrowing costs. But that begs the question: why should an involuntary restructuring lead to worse contagion than a voluntary restructuring of comparable depth? If the banking system were well regulated, with banks holding sovereign debt having purchased insurance, an involuntary restructuring should perturb financial markets less. Of course, it might be argued that if Greece gets away with an involuntary restructuring, others would be tempted to try it as well. Financial markets, worried about this, would immediately raise interest rates on other at-risk eurozone countries, large and small. But the riskiest countries already have been shut out of financial markets, so the possibility of a panic reaction is of limited consequence. Of course, others might be tempted to imitate Greece if the country were indeed better off restructuring than not doing so. That is true, but everyone already knows it. The ECB's behaviour should not be surprising: as we have seen elsewhere, institutions that are not democratically accountable tend to be captured by special interests. That was true before 2008; unfortunately for Europe \u2013 and for the global economy \u2013 the problem has not been adequately addressed since then. Copyright: Project Syndicate, 2012.",

The word coalition is one that has more usually applied to the Greek forces, which are made up of technocratic leaders under prime minister Lucas Papademos and several political parties, two of them firmly right wing. As the Guardian's Athens correspondent Helena Smith points out today, elections due in April are the key to the Greeks taking a hardline, one that has developed in recent months as the prospect of electoral defeat gets closer. Leaders from the Socialist party, the conservative New Democracy party and the small nationalist party Laos are meeting Papademos to seek common ground on the terms of a second \u20ac130bn (\u00a3108bn) bailout that Greece needs to avoid default. Main opposition New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras said yesterday creditors \"are asking for more recession\" from Greece. \"I am fighting in every way to avoid this\". The populist Laos party, believing it will be wiped out if it agrees to consign many voters to worse poverty than they are suffering, is keen to stave off an even larger public spending cuts and longer recession.

      "bodyText": "The beleaguered state of the UK economy has been underlined by three separate reports revealing that Britain's one million small and medium-sized businesses were facing their most difficult year since the recession of 2009. Sharp declines in bank lending to smaller firms, and a collapse in confidence across the sector outlined in the reports will add to concerns that the economy is about to enter a second recession in three years, analysts said. The gloomy reports will also put pressure on the Bank of England to pump an extra \u00a350bn into the economy when it meets on Thursday. Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has indicated he could support an extra boost to the \u00a3270bn quantitative easing programme if there were evidence of a further tightening in bank lending and a deterioration in the economic outlook. Several other members of the nine-strong monetary policy committee are expected to vote in favour, including the economist Adam Posen, who believes an extra \u00a375bn could be justified. The European Central Bank has also faced calls to ease monetary policy to offset cuts in public spending and rising unemployment across the eurozone. The bank, which has allowed European banks to borrow \u00a3500bn since the start of the year in response to the deepening euro crisis, could cut interest rates further to ease borrowing costs, analysts said. Most economists expect the Bank of England to sanction further quantitative easing despite positive figures from the services and manufacturing sectors last week that showed a steady expansion over December and January. According to the Markit/CIPS UK services PMI poll, services firms, which make up more than two-thirds of the economy, were more optimistic about the outlook and had the strongest growth in new business since last July. Businesses in the sector, which includes hotels, restaurants, banks and transport, gave cheer after official figures showed the economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2011 but they hired new workers at the fastest pace for almost four years. However, a report by economic forecasters the Ernst &amp; Young Item Club is expected to dampen the mood. It said bank lending this year would be the lowest since the recession of 2009. The Item Club expects total bank loans \u2013 after expanding by an estimated 4.3% in 2011 \u2013 to contract by 2.2% in 2012, with just 0.9% growth forecast in 2013. Bank lending is considered a crucial measure of economic health and a fall this year could cripple many businesses that have struggled to keep their doors open since the recession. Neil Blake, its senior economic adviser, said: \"We have been warning about the impact bank de-leveraging could have on the economy for some time, but this is the first time there will be an annual contraction in total loans since 2009, when the UK economy was still suffering from the immediate effects of the global financial crisis.\" A separate report, by the accountancy body ICAEW, found that business confidence had fallen at a record rate, and firms were planning to cut investment. Job creation plans also stayed subdued, though small and medium-sized businesses were more likely than larger ones to hire people in the next 12 months, the report said. Michael Izza, chief executive of ICAEW, said: \"At the moment it is hard to see where growth will come from and the chancellor, George Osborne, needs to use the forthcoming budget to give businesses reasons to be more confident about the future \u2013 and unlock potential investments.\" Osborne is understood to favour a boost to quantitative easing by the Bank of England to offset his austerity measures. He came under fire last week from opposition MPs for sticking to his plans after the Institute for Fiscal Studies said he could spend at least an extra \u00a310bn without undermining confidence in the UK's fiscal outlook. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said: \"It is particularly worrying that business expectations for capital investment have fallen for a third successive quarter. Low business confidence is hitting Britain's future growth potential and discouraging firms from investing for the long-term, with over half of businesses surveyed operating below capacity. \"Vince Cable's promise that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills would be the 'department of growth' has been exposed as little more than empty rhetoric, as ministers have failed to adopt an effective plan for growth or take meaningful steps to support businesses and our key sectors. \"Labour's five-point plan would get the economy moving again, including by bringing forward long-term investment projects and temporarily reversing last year's damaging VAT rise.\"",
