      "bodyText": "The Nasdaq index reached a record high on Thursday, topping a record set 15 years ago during the height of the dotcom tech bubble. The index had risen as much as 25 points, or 0.5%, to 5,060.14 by early afternoon, topping its all-time closing high of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000. It ended the day at 5,056.06, up 0.41%. The Dow Jones and S&amp;P have recorded dozens of new highs since the end of the recession. While the Nasdaq has come close to topping its former levels until Thursday, it had always fallen short. The index was the world\u2019s first electronic stock exchange and has become the traditional home of many of tech\u2019s biggest companies. Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Facebook, Google, Intel and Microsoft are all traded on the Nasdaq. But in recent years it has diversified its portfolio of companies, and now includes high-flying biotech stocks including Amgen and Gilead Sciences. The shift may have broadened Nasdaq\u2019s appeal, but it is still heavily weighted to the fortunes of the tech sector. Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, is Nasdaq\u2019s largest component, and its record-breaking share price run has helped propel Nasdaq\u2019s rise. It has taken Nasdaq 15-years to recover from the last big technology crash. On March 10, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index closed at a record of 5,048.62, up 24% since the beginning of the year, and capping an amazing decade in which it skyrocketed over 1,300%. Then the dotcom bubble burst. Nasdaq lost half its value in 2001 and reached an all-time low of 1,108.49 in October 2002. This time, it\u2019s different. At least according to some. Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo, predicted last month that the Nasdaq would soon reach 6,000. \u201cValuations are just very reasonable,\u201d he told CNBC. \u201cI think the big thing that is going to drive the market higher is people buying into the idea that the market isn\u2019t going to fall out from underneath them.\u201d Others are less sure. Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management, said the rise was being underpinned by monetary policy rather than fundamental value of the companies in the index. \u201cUltimately what\u2019s driving this is low interest rates and easy money,\u201d he said. Investors have also bid up social media companies to \u201c1999-2000 level\u201d, he said. Massocca said social media stocks were the \u201cInner Station\u201d \u2013 home to the crazed ivory trader Mr Kurtz in Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness \u2013 at the centre of the story of Nasdaq\u2019s new rise. \u201cI don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to end but I know how,\u201d said Massocca. He said that when investors start to believe the end is coming for the easy monetary policies in the US, Europe and Japan then there would be a \u201cswift and violent\u201d reaction in the stock markets. Worries about a tech bubble have been growing as a new generation of tech companies have attracted sky high valuations. Uber, the taxi app comp[any, is now valued at $41bn, Snapchat, the ephemeral messaging service, is valued at $15bn. Many industry leaders have raised concerns about a new asset bubble. Last month billionaire Mark Cuban, who made a fortune in the last tech boom, warned against the current appetite for tech. \u201cIf we thought it was stupid to invest in public internet websites that had no chance of succeeding back then, it\u2019s worse today,\u201d he wrote in a blogpost.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel\u2019s comments on Greece tonight are being digested by investors; do they make a default less likely? EU leaders have also committed more resources to border patrols in the Med. EC president Jean-Claude Juncker wanted more, though. Angela Merkel is keeping the details of the meeting confidential , alas: Hello again. The European Council summit on migration has ended, so Angela Merkel is holding a press conference. She\u2019s confirmed that talks with Alexis Tsipras were \u2018constructive\u2019, and pointed to Greece\u2019s funding needs: Time for a quick recap. Greece\u2019s prime minister has urged the chancellor of Germany to help speed up the negotiations over the Greek bailout, in an attempt to avoid a potentially catastrophic default in the coming weeks. Alexis Tsipras and Angela Merkel appear to have made some progress, on the sidelines of the emergency EU migration summit , by agreeing that Greece\u2019s primary surplus target should be lowered. A lower primary surplus target frees up funds for growth-friendly policies, or to undo some of the country\u2019s austerity programmes. Government MPs have welcomed the news; but Syriza may still face conflict over the bailout negotiations. Eurozone finance ministers and top Brussels officials are flying to Riga tonight; the Latvian capital will host a Eurogroup meeting tomorrow, where Greece is top of the agenda. But there\u2019s little hope of a breakthrough before the end of April. Bond trading giant Pimco reckons there\u2019s a 30% chance that Greece leaves the eurozone. And Citi has warned that Greece could slide into limbo -- or Grimbo, as they dub it. But other economists think we could see a deal soon, if both sides compromise enough. The big sticking block? Workers\u2019 rights. In other news.... Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank has been hit with a record Libor fine, paying $2.5bn for its role in manipulating bank lending rates. Regulators also blasted Deutsche for obstructing their inquiries, and released details of how traders had conspired to rig Libor rates. Private sector growth across the eurozone slowed this month, with France subsiding back into near stagnation. Data firm Markit pinned some of the blame on the Greek crisis. The news hit European stock markets, with the German DAX and French CAC losing ground. I\u2019ll pop back into this blog again tonight if there are major developments. But otherwise, I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning to cover the eurogroup meeting. Over in Athens tonight, Syriza MPs are welcoming the news that Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras have apparently made some progress at their meeting today. Reports that the two leaders agreed on a reduced primary surplus, of around 1.5%, is being seen as a \u201chuge victory\u201d, even though they\u2019ve not reached agreements on big issues such as labour market reforms. Helena Smith reports from Athens. News that creditors had agreed to a substantially lower primary surplus was received with euphoria in parliament where Syriza MPS have been gathering all afternoon. One said it showed Greece was \u201con the path to overturning the old order.\u201d Rumours that Athens was close to securing a big cut in the primary surplus formerly demanded of Greece, have been circulating for weeks. Another well-placed government insider declared: \u201cBut this finally confirms it and proves that our partners are at last beginning to see sense.\u201d The news ironically follows a stormy session of Syriza\u2019s parliamentary group in which MPs had complained bitterly of not being properly informed about negotiations (and the propensity of government ministers to keep their doors firmly shut). Analysts tonight are saying that the move is clearly aimed at encouraging prime minister Alexis Tsipras to make the boldest move yet: by taking on hardliners in his party now seen as the biggest impediment to reform. An update from the FT\u2019s travel correspondent Brussels chief, as European heavy-hitters jet over to the Eurogroup meeting. If only there were some large buildings in Brussels where these meetings could take place.... Bloomberg has also heard that Angela Merkal and Alexis Tsipras made some progress at their meeting: Greece and its creditors have found common ground on the target for the country\u2019s primary budget surplus being set at 1.5 percent of economy output for 2015 and also converge on the 2016 target, the official said, without specifying 2016 figure. The two sides also have converged on privatizations, the official said without providing details. So, with the two leaders agreeing \u201cin principle\u201d to speed up technical talks, here\u2019s speculation of another meeting of finance ministers soon (as well as tomorrow\u2019s gathering). Tsipras and Merkel have agreed that Greece should aim for a primary budget surplus of between 1.2% and 1.5% this year, according to the Kathimerini newspaper tonight. That counts as progress (reminder, the old bailout deal which the new government rejected set a 3% target) BUT they have not solved the other outstanding issues; including how to shake up Greece\u2019s employment market. Attention is now turning to Riga, the capital of Latvia, where eurozone finance ministers are meeting tomorrow. The Brussels press pack are jetting off now in -- lets hope airBaltic have stocked up on the inflight drinkies. You hear a lot about relations between Greece and Germany being strained, with Athens seeking war reparations and many Germans believing Greece should leave the euro. But Greece\u2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has explained today about how German radio kept spirits up during Greece\u2019s military dictatorship. Writing on his blog, Varoufakis says: One of the enduring memories from my early childhood is the crackling sound of Deutsche Welle radio transmissions. Those were the bleak years of our dictatorship (1967-1974) when Deutsche Welle was the Greeks\u2019 most precious ally against the crushing power of state propaganda. Mum and dad would huddle together next to the wireless, sometimes covered by a blanket to make sure that nosy neighbours would not get a chance to call the secret police. Night after night these \u2018forbidden\u2019 radio programs brought into our home a breath of fresh air from a country, Germany, that was standing firm on the side of Greek democrats. While I was too young to understand what the radio was telling my mesmerised parents, my child\u2019s imagination identified Germany as a source of hope. As I am writing this preface to the German edition of a book aimed at another child, my daughter, I feel the urgent need to recount that memory. To turn it into a small homage to the idea of Europe as a realm of shared democratic ideals. A small gesture of defiance against the recent tendency for European peoples, who were hitherto coming closer and closer together, to be set apart by a\u2026 common currency. And that\u2019s part of a preface for a German version of a book he wrote, to explain economics to his daughter. Three months into office, and Alexis Tsipras is sticking to his pledge not to wear a tie until Greece gets a new debt deal with its creditors: More newsflashes are coming in from Brussels, following Alexis Tsipras\u2019s meeting with Angela Merkel on the sidelines of the summit on migration. A Greek official is telling reporters that the two leaders agreed that progress is being made between Greece and its creditors. Importantly, that includes Greece\u2019s primary surplus target -- ie, how much of a surplus (ignoring debt servicing costs) Athens should aim for. The existing bailout calls for a 3% primary surplus; Tsipras\u2019s government want a figures of around 1.5%. Greek bonds have rallied today, on hopes of a deal. This has pushed down the yield on its debt -- meaning investors see the bonds as slightly less risky (but still dangerous to own). Wall Street is shrugging off the Greek crisis. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is on track to close at a new record high, beating the previous record set in March 2000 - just before the dot-com bubble burst. Concerns over Greece lingered over Europe\u2019s stock markets again today, pushing shares down across the region. This morning\u2019s weak PMI surveys, showing weaker than expected growth in Germany and France, also hit confidence. German DAX: down 143 points or 1.2% at 11723 French CAC: down 32 points or 0.6% at 5178. Greek bonds have rallied a little today, though, following reports from Athens officials that a deal could be close. Investors aren\u2019t convinced, though. Joshua Mahony, market analyst at IG, says: The widely perceived impending crisis that is Greece took another turn as a Greek government official stated that according to the current rate of progress, a deal would be done by the end of the month. Unfortunately, for anyone with a memory, this simply reinforces the trend of Greek positivity and disregard for the needs of their creditors, followed by negativity and worry from creditors who repeatedly get their demands rebuffed. German officials are briefing that Berlin wants to keep Greece in the euro. But any deal must include detailed, costed economic reforms to make Greece\u2019s public finances sustainable. One official said: \u201cAt the highest level, the Germans want to keep Greece in the euro area and find a solution, but time is running short and there may have to be more drama before Tsipras can put his foot down and reach an agreement.\u201d Alexis Tsipras\u2019s call for negotiations to be accelerated may irk EU officials, who blame the Greek side for the lack of progress this year. Earlier today, EC vice-president Jyrki Katainen said that trust between Athens and Brussels has been eroded in recent months. Jyrki Katainen told a press conference in Athens that: \u201cYou cannot negotiate if you don\u2019t trust. I have to be honest here, it has decreased. It\u2019s not because of the people but it\u2019s very difficult to understand everything, what is going on.\u201d He was in Greece to promote the EU\u2019s new \u20ac315bn investment plan. Greece\u2019s Tsipras urges speeded up process to clinch debt deal Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for a speeding up of the process to conclude a reform-for-cash deal with euro zone creditors after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday, a Greek official said. The official said the short meeting on the sidelines of a European Union summit in Brussels - their first since Tsipras visited Berlin on March 23 - took place \u201cin a positive and constructive atmosphere\u201d. Euro zone officials say little progress has been made in detailed negotiations on a Greek economic reform programme, partly because Athens has denied representatives of its creditors access to state accounting data. The official gave no details of their discussion but said: \u201cDuring the meeting, the significant progress made since the Berlin meeting until today was noted. The prime minister asked that the procedures be speeded up so that the Feb. 20 decision, which foresees a first interim agreement by the end of April, be implemented.\u201d Alexis Tsipras has ended his meeting with Angela Merkel. According to Reuters, Tsipras urged the German chancellor to help speed up the negotiations around Greece\u2019s bailout, in an attempt to unlock the \u20ac7.2bn of outstanding funds soon. BRUSSELS - GREEK PM SAYS AFTER MERKEL TALKS HE CALLS FOR SPEEDED UP PROCESS TO IMPLEMENT FEBRUARY DEBT DEAL BRUSSELS - TSIPRAS SAYS TALKS WITH MERKEL TOOK PLACE IN \u201cPOSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE SPIRIT\u201d An official has also told Bloomberg that Tsipras pushed Merkel for an \u2018interim\u2019 deal by the end of this month. That would give Greece some of the money it needs to meet its wage and pensions bill on April 30th, and almost \u20ac1bn of IMF payments due in May. Seasoned euro zone crisis watchers will be aware that today marks the FIFTH anniversary of Athens announcing that it had crashed on the rocks of deficit and debt and had no other choice but to enter an EU-IMF rescue programme, writes Helena Smith from Athens. The news, broken by the then prime minister George Papandreou on the far-flung Aegean island of Castellorizo, hit the nation with the force of a bomb shell, triggering ferocious protests and riots by Greeks denouncing the painful austerity measures enforced in return for bailout funds. Interestingly, there has been no mention of the anniversary today - by any political party. Cynics saying it may well be too dark a day to recall. Crisis, what crisis? Angela Merkel and Alexis Tsipras have now met in Brussels to discuss the Greek crisis, and the pair were all smiles (at least for the cameras) J\u00fcrgen Fitschen and Anshu Jain, Co-Chief Executive Officers of Deutsche Bank, just issued a statement on today\u2019s record Libor fine. \u201cWe deeply regret this matter but are pleased to have resolved it. The Bank accepts the findings of the regulators. \u201cWe have disciplined or dismissed individuals involved in the trader misconduct; have substantially strengthened our control teams, procedures and record-keeping; and are conducting a thorough review of the Bank\u2019s actions in addressing this matter. \u201cThis agreement marks another step in addressing the past and ensuring that the Bank earns back the trust of its clients, shareholders and society at large.\u201d The Greek government has sent some photos over, showing Alexis Tsipras taking an economy flight to Brussels today. There was still room for an impromptu press briefing... ....and Tsipras did at least bag the window seat. High office does have some privileges, even in a debt crisis.... German officials say that Merkel will be pushing Alexis Tsipras to speed up the reform process (suggesting she might not appreciate being chivvied by the Greek PM) Back to Greece....and prime minister Alexis Tsipras has just arrived in Brussels for today\u2019s emergency summit on migration (and a discussion on Greek reforms with Angela Merkel). Another example of wrongdoing, from the CFTC. Despite the obvious conflict of interest, Deutsche Bank allowed at times its traders who primarily traded derivatives, such as its Yen derivatives trader, to be responsible for the Bank\u2019s submissions, thus making it easy to skew the bank\u2019s submissions to benefit their own positions and to accommodate the requests of their fellow derivatives traders. The key to the Libor scandal is that some staff would be taking financial positions on the Libor rate (the official measure of the rates which banks would lend to each other), while their colleagues would be submitting the information used to calculate the rate. So how did Deutsche Bank take advantage of this? America\u2019s Commodity Futures Trading Commission says certain Deutsche Bank managers actually encouraged derivatives traders, money market traders, and submitters to conspire to fix the Libor rate. Some even restructured business lines such that derivatives traders and submitters sat together in the London office. In this environment, traders often shouted their requests for beneficial submissions across the trading floor to the submitters. A senior manager regularly sat with the traders and encouraged them and their counterparts in other offices to communicate and exchange trading positions, so submitters became clearly aware of the submissions that were most favorable to the various desks\u2019 trading positions. Senior desk managers in London, Frankfurt, New York, and the Tokyo subsidiary of Deutsche Bank also made requests to benefit their own trading positions, facilitated their traders\u2019 requests for beneficial submissions, and promoted the profit-driven submission practices to help the traders increase profits and minimize losses on their and the desk\u2019s trading positions. Regulators have also produced evidence of how Deutsche Bank staff conspired to fix the Libor rate by submitting inaccurate information. One did it for a free coffee, while another pleaded desperately (and irritatingly, frankly) for some help. And there\u2019s stinging criticism for Deutsche Bank too; the FCA says it repeatedly misled the regulator over the Libor investigation. It also warns that the problems at the German bank appear to be \u201cdeeply ingrained\u201d. Georgina Philippou, acting director of enforcement and market oversight, says: \u201cThis case stands out for the seriousness and duration of the breaches by Deutsche Bank \u2013 something reflected in the size of today\u2019s fine. One division at Deutsche Bank had a culture of generating profits without proper regard to the integrity of the market. This wasn\u2019t limited to a few individuals but, on certain desks, it appeared deeply ingrained.\u201d \u201cDeutsche Bank\u2019s failings were compounded by them repeatedly misleading us. The bank took far too long to produce vital documents and it moved far too slowly to fix relevant systems and controls.\u201d \u201cThis case shows how seriously we view a failure to cooperate with our investigations and our determination to take action against firms where we see wrongdoing.\u201d Breaking: Deutsche Bank has just been hit with a $2.5bn fine for its role in the scandal in which traders manipulated the official interbank lending rates. The penalty includes a \u00a3227m fine from Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority -- its biggest ever fine over Libor. More to follow... The chief investment officer at bond giant Pimco reckons there\u2019s a 30% chance Greece will exit the euro. Mihir Worah told reporters today that Grexit could rock the markets, and thus create some tasty buying opportunities: \u201cWe want to reduce our risk and have some dry powder to buy assets in Europe because we think a Greece exit will be volatile,\u201d \u201cBut at the end of the day it\u2019s not going to impact the global economy, it could be a buying opportunity if you\u2019ve got the wherewithal and you\u2019re not in pain yourself.\u201d A 30% risk is a nice round number; but it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s really based on sound maths: Oh to be a fly on the wall in Brussels today. According to the Kathmerini newspaper, Alexis Tsipras is planning to tell Angela Merkel that he\u2019s compromised, and now it\u2019s her turn. I did what I said I would. Now it\u2019s your turn to do what you told me,\u201d is the message that the Greek premier was expected to put across to the German leader, according to a top government source, Kathimerini understands. Over in Athens officials are holding out hope that the Greek premier\u2019s meeting with Angela Merkel, on the sidelines of today\u2019s emergency EU migration summit, will help break the deadlock in ongoing negotiations by paving the way to a political solution. Helena Smith reports from Athens: In Athens, Paris and Brussels where technical teams have been working feverishly to break the deadlock, there is growing and evident concern that the gridlock in negotiations is going to be hard to break. Ever-shifting deadlines \u2013 the next euro group meeting of May 11 is increasingly being seen as the make-or-break date \u2013 appear to have given Greek officials little cause for optimism. Today Kostas Chrysogonos, the prominent Syriza Euro parliamentarian, repeated that a referendum may be the only way out, telling Mega TV that if the talks fail by the cut off date of May 11, a plebiscite should be immediately put to the Greek people. Athens\u2019s leading negotiator Nikos Theoharakis expressed further pessimism telling reporters in Paris that \u201cthe distance between the two sides\u201d was so great only a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d could yield results. Theoharakis heads up fiscal policy at the finance ministry, so his comments carry plenty of weight. Helena adds: In this context today\u2019s meeting between Alexis Tsipras and Angela Merkel could be decisive, analysts say \u2013 even if Berlin has gone out of its way to play down the significance of the t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. More than ever, the talks will give the Greek prime minister a clearer idea of how much leeway Athens now has given the parlous state of the real economy. \u201cThe meeting is likely to play a major role in the decisions the prime minister will make,\u201d Takis Hadzis, a prominent political commentator told Skai news. On the basis of the talks, Tsipras may well decide whether to call fresh elections or a referendum in the weeks ahead. Both are being described as potentially catastrophic for Greece\u2019s place in the eurozone by Athens\u2019 political opposition. We\u2019ve not seen much of Greece\u2019s previous prime minister since January\u2019s election. But Antonis Samaras has broken cover to warn that the country has now reached \u201ca dead end\u201d, and urge Alexis Tsipras to reach a deal with creditors. He told Mega TV that: The government has fooled society. At this point it has to clash either with our creditors, or with itself....The country is isolated. If the government does not pay, Grexit returns. There must be a deal.\u201d Over in Brussels, Greece\u2019s prime minister Alexis Tsipras has confirmed that he\u2019ll meet Angela Merkel on the sidelines of today\u2019s emergency migration summit; and also the French president, Francois Hollande. It\u2019s two months since the three leaders held a special meeting after an EU Summit, that was meant to kick-start negotiations. Greek bonds are rallying, following that report that a deal is \u2018very close\u2019 -- but this still leaves yields at dangerously high levels. Just in: Greek officials are briefing that a deal is \u201cvery close\u201d.... and Friday\u2019s meeting of finance ministers could bring it even closer. Bloomberg argues that Greece and its creditors aren\u2019t actually too far from a deal.... I\u2019ve got a personal theory that you can measure the state of the eurozone crisis by the number of \u2018catchy\u2019 terms dreamed up by City analysts. And Citigroup have just added another one to the lexicon -- by warning that Greece risks sliding into a protracted limbo, or \u201cGrimbo\u201d. In a new note called \u201cGreece: Running Out of Money, Ideas, Time and Patience\u201d, they warn that Greece could potentially stagger on into June without new funds. They say: \u201cOver time, the stressed liquidity situation, and notably deposit-withdrawal restrictions for banks, would significantly increase pressure on the Greek government, making fresh elections likely. Those could produce a mandate for a new bailout agreement with the euro zone or pave the way for an eventual Grexit, but this could still leave Greece in limbo for an extended period of time.\u201d That scenario looks more and more likely following Valdis Dombrovskis\u2019s warning that technical talks will drag into May (at least). After a steady start, European stock markets have now fallen into the red - not helped by the disappointing PMI data from France this morning. Wall Street is expected to dip too when it opens in a few hours time. The ONS has also reported that Britain\u2019s public sector net borrowing requirement (the deficit) fell by 11% in the 2014-15 financial year. The UK borrowed \u00a387.3bn to balance the books, meaning the government has achieved its target of a deficit of \u00a390bn or below. George Osborne\u2019s original target was to have all-but-eliminated the deficit by this point, of course, a plan that was ditched in 2012 (at which point the economy started to recover again) Crumbs. UK retail sales fell by 0.5% last month, dashing expectations of a 0.4% rise. It\u2019s mainly due to a surprise (and slightly perplexing) slide in fuel sales. The ONS says: On the month, the quantity bought decreased by 0.5% compared with February 2015. The largest decrease was reported by petrol stations which fell by 6.2%. And prices continues to fall, suggesting the UK inflation rate may fall into negative territory soon. Average store prices (including petrol stations) fell for the 9th consecutive month, falling by 3.1% compared with March 2014. The largest contribution to the year-on-year fall once again came from petrol stations which fell by 12.8% and is the 19th consecutive month of year-on-year falling prices in this store type. Private sector growth across the whole eurozone has slowed a little this month, thanks to France\u2019s latest flirtation with stagnation. Markit\u2019s eurozone composite PMI, which tracks activity across thousands of firms, fell back to 53.3 from 54.0 last month. But firms in the periphery of Europe are powering ahead, with the biggest jump in activity since the credit crunch. Markit says: The slowdown reflected weaker rates of expansion in France and Germany, which offset an acceleration of growth in the rest of the region to the fastest since August 2007. The ongoing Greece crisis may also be causing some firms to rethink their plans, or hold back until it is resolved. Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson, explains: \u201cThere are signs of increased risk aversion creeping in among businesses and their customers, linked in some cases to worries about Greece, which is likely to have dampened demand. However, in the case of France, the poor performance appears to reflect a longer-term malaise which, after a promising start to the year, in fact shows few signs of lifting.\u201d Europe\u2019s economy is \u2018turning the corner\u2019, says the European Central bank\u2019s chief economist a few moments ago. Peter Praet is telling an audience in Berlin that: The euro area economy seems now to be turning the corner. Both the hard and soft data suggest that the activity is gathering momentum and looks set to strengthen over the course of this year. Consistent with this, all the major forecasting institutions have revised up their expectations for GDP growth in 2015 and the years ahead. We are therefore seeing the beginnings of a cyclical recovery. But it is not yet a structural one. What I mean by this is that, though the business cycle is improving, the notable decline in euro area\u2019s potential growth rate has not been addressed, which can be imagined as the \u201cspeed limit\u201d of the economy \u2013 the rate at which it can grow while maintaining stable inflation. International institutions currently estimate the potential growth rate to be below 1% in the euro area, compared with above 2% in the United States... The solution? Our old friend \u2018structural reforms\u2019, to make firms more competitive and productive. Praet also took a subtle pop at the ECB\u2019s notorious decision to raise interest rates twice in 2011, just as the eurozone crisis was escalating. European Commission vice-president Jyrki Katainen is in Athens today, drumming up interest in Brussels\u2019 new \u20ac315bn investment plan. Looks like a nice day for it, too: That \u201cNew Deal\u201d is Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s big idea to pull Europe out of its economic woes; but it\u2019s hard to know what Katainen can achieve in Greece until its funding crisis has been resolved... The French and German PMI data has sent the euro falling by half a cent against the US dollar. Just in: Germany\u2019s economy is also performing less well than expected this month. Activity across German services sector and manufacturing companies is still growing, but at a slower rate. (remember, any reading over 50 = growth). Markit, which compiles the report, says that private sector activity growth in Germany \u201cslowed slightly\u201d this month; again, despite the benefits of cheaper oil and a weak currency. Let\u2019s not panic; the \u2018composite\u2019 PMI is still the second-highest in eight months, at 54.2 down from 55.4 in March. And German companies did report that output and new orders are still rising, but at a slower pace. But taken with this morning\u2019s disappointing French data, it suggests Europe\u2019s economy is slowing down just when it ought to be picking up pace. European stock markets are inching higher in early trading, heading back to their highest levels since 2001. And a French manufacturer is leading the way. Shares in Michelin jumped almost 5%, after reporting a 5.6% rise in first-quarter revenues last night. That\u2019s partly thanks to the weaker euro boosting overseas sales revenue. In London, the FTSE 100 is up just 7 points at 7035. Bloomberg economist Maxime Sbaihi is disappointed that French factories aren\u2019t taking advantage of cheaper oil prices and a weak currency: Credit Agricole\u2019s Fred Ducrozet, though, is encouraged that service sector firms are more upbeat. The slowdown in French corporate activity suggests the French economy may not grow strongly this quarter: Hopes that French firms are recovering have just taken a knock, with a survey showing that the private sector slipped back to near-stagnation this month. That\u2019s according to data firm Markit. Its monthly survey of France\u2019s service sector has dropped to a three-month low of 50.8, near to the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. And the manufacturing PMI fell deeper into contraction territory, down from 48.8 to 48.4. Jack Kennedy, Senior Economist at Markit, says French companies are still struggling. \u201cOutput growth stuttered almost to a halt in April, signalling a continuation of the moribund economic environment in France. New business growth weakened despite a further marked fall in prices charged, highlighting the competitive challenge facing French companies. Service providers\u2019 business expectations improved to a 37-month high, although it remains difficult to see much justification for this optimism and sentiment remains historically low.\u201d Reaction to follow.... Some early reaction to Dombrovskis\u2019 comments: Dombrovskis also said that Brussels still reckons Greece will avoid a Grexit: European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis has warned that Greece is unlikely to hit the latest deadline of a technical agreement with its creditors. Speaking on the German ARD TV network this morning, Dombrovskis also warned that progress between the two side is \u2018not good\u2019. Reuters have the details: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to conduct the technical talks further and finish them perhaps in May or so,\u201d Dombrovskis told German TV network ARD. He said it is important that all sides, including Greece, stick to their obligations. He also said: \u201cThe talks are going on. Progress is not good.\u201d April 30 had been inked in as a deadline by Greece\u2019s increasingly exasperated lenders, but progress between the two sides over the details of economic reforms clearly remains slow. Dombrovskis\u2019s comments means there\u2019s no chance of a reform list being presented to finance ministers in Riga tomorrow, and thus no hope of any cash being extended to Athens. The day has begun with worrying economic news from China, showing that factory activity declined at its fastest pace in a year. The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) fell to 49.2 in April, below the 50-point level that shows whether the sector expanded or contracted. It\u2019s a bigger decline than expected, with Chinese firms reporting that new orders also fell at the fastest rate in 12 months. And job shedding across manufacturing firms was recorded for the eighteenth month in a row, adding to fears of a slowdown. And output and input prices also fell, suggesting deflationary pressures growing: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Coming up today, the usual flurry of chatter and rumours around Greece ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Riga. Greece\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is due to speak with Angela Merkel about the crisis today in Brussels on the sidelines of a summit to discuss Europe\u2019s migration crisis. Lots of economic data on the agenda. The \u2018flash PMI\u2019 surveys showing how the eurozone\u2019s manufacturing and service sector firms are performing this month. French composite PMI, 8am BST German composite PMI, 8.30am BST Eurozone composite PMI, 9am BST Those surveys will show whether or not the eurozone\u2019s private sector is continuing to grow. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: The latest French manufacturing and services PMI numbers are expected to show an improvement to 49.2 for manufacturing from 48.8, and to remain stable at 52.4 for services. In Germany further improvement is expected for both numbers, to 53 for manufacturing and 55.5 for services. Then at 9.30am, we get the latest UK retail sales and public borrowing statistics, giving another insight into the British economy ahead of next month\u2019s general election. I\u2019ll be tracking all the main events through the day.",

Those were the bleak years of our dictatorship (1967-1974) when Deutsche Welle was the Greeks\u2019 most precious ally against the crushing power of state propaganda. Mum and dad would huddle together next to the wireless, sometimes covered by a blanket to make sure that nosy neighbours would not get a chance to call the secret police. Night after night these \u2018forbidden\u2019 radio programs brought into our home a breath of fresh air from a country, Germany, that was standing firm on the side of Greek democrats. While I was too young to understand what the radio was telling my mesmerised parents, my child\u2019s imagination identified Germany as a source of hope.</p> <p>As I am writing this preface to the German edition of a book aimed at another child, my daughter, I feel the urgent need to recount that memory. To turn it into a small homage to the idea of Europe as a realm of shared democratic ideals.

Ever-shifting deadlines \u2013 the next euro group meeting of May 11 is increasingly being seen as the make-or-break date \u2013 appear to have given Greek officials little cause for optimism. </p> <p>Today Kostas Chrysogonos, the prominent Syriza Euro parliamentarian, repeated that a referendum may be the only way out, telling Mega TV that if the talks fail by the cut off date of May 11, a plebiscite should be immediately put to the Greek people.</p> <p>Athens\u2019s leading negotiator Nikos Theoharakis expressed further pessimism telling reporters in Paris that \u201cthe distance between the two sides\u201d was so great only a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d could yield results.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Theoharakis heads up fiscal policy at the finance ministry, so his comments carry plenty of weight.</strong></p> <p>Helena adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In this context today\u2019s meeting between Alexis Tsipras and Angela Merkel could be decisive, analysts say \u2013 even if Berlin has gone out of its way to play down the significance of the <em>t\u00eate</em>-<em>\u00e0-t\u00eate</em>. More than ever, the talks will give the Greek prime minister a clearer idea of how much leeway Athens now has given the parlous state of the real economy.</p> <p>\u201cThe meeting is likely to play a major role in the decisions the prime minister will make,\u201d Takis Hadzis, a prominent political commentator told Skai news. On the basis of the talks, Tsipras may well decide whether to call fresh elections or a referendum in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>Both are being described as potentially catastrophic for Greece\u2019s place in the eurozone by Athens\u2019 political opposition.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5538cabbe4b0495ffd44a0fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-04-23T11:09:10.696Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We\u2019ve not seen much of Greece\u2019s previous prime minister since January\u2019s election. </p> <p>But <strong>Antonis Samaras</strong> has broken cover to warn that the country has now reached \u201ca dead end\u201d, and urge Alexis Tsipras to reach a deal with creditors.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_23/04/2015_549363\">He told Mega TV that</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government has fooled society.

The American trader who urged a colleague \u201cstrap on a pair and jack up the 3M\u201d was an outlier. Politeness, of course, is beside the point. Indeed, the traders\u2019 language illustrates how attempting to rig Libor and equivalent markets had become a humdrum activity at Deutsche. As the Financial Conduct Authority puts it, the culture was \u201cdeeply ingrained\u201d. Worse by far, though, was Deutsche\u2019s cack-handed dealings with regulators when the scandal broke and documents were demanded. Deutsche officials sometimes misled investigators and the bank\u2019s record-keeping was a shambles. Some 482 tapes of telephone calls were destroyed by mistake and the bank took two years to produce other recordings. Thus Deutsche\u2019s fines are deservedly bigger than other banks\u2019.

For good measure, Benjamin Lawsky at New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services demanded that seven Deutsche employees be fired by the end of the day. But another part of the script is wearingly familiar \u2013 nobody at the top of the bank knew a thing.

It seems barely credible. No wonder the regulators would prefer the outside world to concentrate on the size of the fines. They have done nothing to advance the principle that accountability goes to the top. Takeover takes away important tech player It would be a struggle to call Pace a UK national champion in technology but, in a thin field, the Saltaire-based global leader in set-top boxes is one of our bigger stockmarket-listed players. Soon it won\u2019t be. It has agreed to be taken over by Arris of the US. The takeover terms are undoubtedly attractive for those long-term Pace shareholders who were staring at a 50p share price at the end of 2011. Arris is offering 426.5p per share, a mix of 132.5p in cash plus its own stock. Actually, the terms are better than that, thanks to the surge in those Arris shares in overnight US trading. Pace closed at 447p, 35% better than Wednesday\u2019s level. Pace was not looking for this deal but, at a push, one could concede there is some commercial logic. Some big US customers are combining \u2013 witness AT&amp;T\u2019s planned takeover of satellite TV operator DirecTV \u2013 so their suppliers might feel the need to get bigger too. But three other factors are at work here. First, the strength of the US dollar makes UK-listed companies more vulnerable to bids. Second, US companies can still play tax games by flipping their domicile to the UK in some circumstances. New Arris will be incorporated in the UK but keep its headquarters in the US and reckons the shuffle will reduce its tax rate from 37% to 26%-28%.

These \u201cblack swan\u201d events, as the bookies have taken to calling them, are more common because betting habits are changing.

      "bodyText": "Greece\u2019s increasingly desperate financial state was highlighted on Thursday when the country\u2019s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, urged the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to use her influence to speed up deadlocked negotiations over a new aid package. Amid signs that the long-running talks between Athens and its creditors are having a dampening effect on the eurozone economy, Tsipras used a meeting with Merkel in Brussels to seek an interim deal by the end of the month that would provide money in return for a Greek commitment to reform. The conversation between Tsipras and Merkel came on the fifth anniversary of Greece\u2019s first call for a financial bailout, and raised hopes in the financial markets that a deal can be done before the stricken eurozone country runs out of money to pay pensions, salaries and debts to the International Monetary Fund. Shares in Athens rose by 2.4% after falling to a three-year low on Wednesday while interest rates (the yield) on two-year Greek bonds fell from 27.6% to 25.5%. A Greek official said the meeting between Tsipras and Merkel had taken place in a \u201cpositive and constructive atmosphere\u201d and expressed confidence that a deal was close. The official gave no details of the discussion but said: \u201cDuring the meeting, the significant progress made since the Berlin meeting until today was noted. The prime minister asked that the procedures be speeded up so that the 20 Feb decision, which foresees a first interim agreement by the end of April, be implemented.\u201d An interim deal would give Greece some of the money it needs to meet its \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.4bn) wages and pensions bill on 30 April, and to make two payments to the IMF totalling \u20ac970m in early May. But the mood among European commission officials was less upbeat, with Brussels sources saying that the refusal of Athens to provide information meant little real progress had been made. It had been hoped that finance ministers from the 18-strong eurozone would sign off a new package of help for Greece when they meet in Riga on Friday. That, though, has proved impossible, prompting speculation that Greece is moving closer to a debt default that could lead to its departure from the eurozone. The European commission and the European Central Bank have been expressing confidence that there would be no serious consequences from a Greek exit from the single currency. But the latest snapshot of the eurozone economy provided evidence of a slowdown in activity, which analysts blamed on the protracted Greek crisis. Jessica Hinds, a European economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cApril\u2019s fall in the eurozone composite PMI suggested that fears over Greece might already be starting to dampen economic growth in the region, offsetting any boost from loose monetary policy and the weakness of the euro. \u201cThe decline in the headline economy-wide output index from 54.0 to 53.5 was in contrast to the consensus and our own expectation of a small rise. The fall reflected declines in both the manufacturing and services components.\u201d Failure to reach an agreement in Riga means the next meeting of the euro group of finance ministers on 11 May is now being seen as the make-or-break date. In Athens, some leading politicians expressed concern about the lack of progress. Kostas Chrysogonos, the prominent Syriza MEP, said a referendum may be the only way out, telling Mega TV that if the talks fail by the cutoff date of 11 May, a plebiscite should be immediately put to the Greek people. Athens\u2019s leading negotiator, Nikos Theoharakis, expressed further pessimism, telling reporters in Paris that \u201cthe distance between the two sides\u201d was so great only a \u201cpolitical solution\u201d could yield results. Meanwhile, Antonis Samaras, Tsipras\u2019s predecessor as prime minister, warned that Greece had reached a \u201cdead end\u201d and urged the government to reach a deal with its creditors. \u201cThe government has fooled society.

      "bodyText": "Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank has been fined a record $2.5bn (\u00a31.7bn) for rigging Libor, ordered to fire seven employees and accused of being obstructive towards regulators in their investigations into the global manipulation of the benchmark rate. The penalties on Germany\u2019s largest bank also involve a guilty plea to the Department of Justice (DoJ) in the US and a deferred prosecution agreement. The regulators released a cache of emails, electronic messages and phone calls showing the attempts to move the rate used to price \u00a33.5tn of financial contracts. \u201cI\u2019m begging u pleassssssssssssssseeeeeeeeee I\u2019m on my knees\u201d is among the examples provided by regulators in hundreds of pages of detail accompanying the fine \u2013 the eighth related to rigging interest rates. Another trader, on learning a rate was unchanged, sent a message saying: \u201cOh bullshit.....strap on a pair and jack up the 3M (month). Hahahahaha.\u201d . Georgina Philippou, the acting director of enforcement and market oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority, said the UK\u2019s portion of the fine \u2013 \u00a3227m \u2013 was a record for Libor because the bank had been misleading the regulator. The manipulation took place to generate profits and was pervasive, the FCA said. \u201cThis case stands out for the seriousness and duration of the breaches by Deutsche Bank \u2013 something reflected in the size of today\u2019s fine. One division at Deutsche Bank had a culture of generating profits without proper regard to the integrity of the market. This wasn\u2019t limited to a few individuals but, on certain desks, it appeared deeply ingrained,\u201d she said. \u201cDeutsche Bank\u2019s failings were compounded by them repeatedly misleading us. The bank took far too long to produce vital documents and it moved far too slowly to fix relevant systems and controls,\u201d said Philippou. The German bank had said on Wednesday that it would still remain profitable in the first quarter when it reports results next week before a major restructuring that could involve the bank pulling back from the high street. For the first time in a Libor-rigging settlement, New York state\u2019s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) was involved and it ordered the bank to sack seven employees \u2013 one managing director, four directors and one vice-president, all based in London, together with one Frankfurt-based vice-president. The bank immediately took action to comply with this demand. In total 29 Deutsche employees were involved but the bank was unable to say how many staff had been sacked or disciplined as a result. The NYDFS also said that Deutsche employees had coordinated their submission to the range of interest-rate benchmarks \u2013 also known as Euribor \u2013 with a number of banks including Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citibank, Merrill Lynch, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral and UBS. Until now, fines have been levied by the FCA along with the DoJ and other regulators such as the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The total of $2.5bn includes $600m to the NYDFS, $800m to the CFTC and $775m to the DoJ. It covers the period 2005 to 2010. \u201cDeutsche Bank secretly conspired with its competitors to rig the benchmark interest rates at the heart of the global financial system,\u201d said Bill Baer, an assistant attorney general at the DoJ. He said the bank\u2019s misconduct \u201cnot only harmed its unsuspecting counterparties, it undermined the integrity and the competitiveness of financial markets everywhere\u201d. The bank had admitted within days of the first fine \u2013 on Barclays in June 2012 \u2013 that it was involved in rigging but it has taken until now for the investigation to be concluded. The FCA said its work had been delayed because Deutsche Bank had failed to provide timely, accurate and complete information, erroneously deleted 482 tapes of telephone calls and claimed it could not hand over a report commissioned by the German regulator BaFin. A compliance officer had also signed confirmation in January 2011 that the bank\u2019s Libor processess had been audited when this was not the case. Libor involved a panel of banks sending submissions about the price they expected to be charged to borrow from rival banks across a range of currencies and time scales.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s an old Wall Street saying that goes: \u201cPigs get fed, but hogs get slaughtered.\u201d For some insiders, the initial public offerings market captures the truth of this better than most other corners of the financial world, if only because it offers the opportunity for so many different folks to get their noses into the trough. The investment banks are eager to collect some of the fattest fees that Wall Street offers, at least when measured as a percentage of the size of the deal (as much as 7% of the proceeds go to the underwriters). So they will fight for the assignment, shepherd a marquee name to market, and collect the largest share of the fees and the bragging rights. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have been waiting for this day for years. When only a fraction \u2013 10%-20% \u2013 of start-up companies even stand a chance of going public at all and earning the biggest paydays for their early backers, this is akin to winning the lottery. With help from the bankers, they will sometimes try to price the new stock to extract every penny of value from new investors. Those investors, meanwhile, are desperately hoping that bankers, entrepreneurs and early investors will leave enough on the table that they, the latest to arrive on the scene, will see a big first-day \u201cpop\u201d in the value of their new shares, and score an instant killing. In a lot of ways, last week\u2019s IPO of Virtu Financial was the epitome of what we think of as a classic Wall Street IPO. Its entire business model is built around a form of greed, in that its high-speed trading business strives to help firms shave milliseconds off their trading times and capture inefficiencies that, when added up over time, can turn into millions, even billions, of dollars of profit for its customers. Forced to postpone its IPO by the hullabaloo surrounding the publication of Michael Lewis\u2019s book, Flash Boys \u2013 demonizing its industry and suggesting that high-frequency traders distorted the market \u2013 Virtu had the last laugh: it raised $314m, pricing its stock at $19 a share (more than expected), as demand outpaced supply at a ratio of 15-to-1. The shares and those new investors enjoyed a respectable 24% gain in the first day of trading, ending at $23.60. Greed triumphed. Or did it? One of the other IPOs that priced the same day couldn\u2019t have been a greater contrast to Virtu Financial, with a business model that embraces capitalism while rejecting greed. It\u2019s a tale of two IPOs \u2013 and two business models. And the phenomenon behind it \u2013 the tale of the \u201cB Corp\u201d \u2013 is starting to raise questions about whether there might be such a phenomenon as sustainable capitalism. Etsy, an online marketplace for all kinds of artisanal products (I\u2019ve eyeballed the most amazing hand-crafted furniture there, and purchased patterns for quilts), takes Wall Street right back to its Main Street roots. By helping Virtu Financial find capital, Wall Street is continuing in the path that it has pursued since the 1990s, and treating itself as its own best customer. Financing Etsy, a forum in which some 1.4 million active sellers find nearly 20 million buyers for their products worldwide, means providing capital to a marketplace that keeps those millions of small businesses operating \u2013 giving them, in their turn, access to their own sources of capital. Etsy is aware of this role, which is why it became a B Corp in 2012. So far, there are only 1,257 of these rare animals worldwide, according to B Lab, the nonprofit organization that designed and monitors the certifications. To earn the designation, a company has to make clear to everyone, from its employees and customers to its investors, that its motives go well beyond greed. Rather than maximizing profits, it should be able to prove that its priorities include factors like finding ways to empower employees and pay them a living wage, to produce high-quality products without taking a toll on the environment, or in some other way conduct business \u201cas if people and place mattered\u201d. It\u2019s enough to give a Goldman Sachs banker a fit of the vapors. And yet, of the two IPOs, it was Etsy that posted the bigger first-day \u201cpop\u201d, which seems to suggest that something about the company\u2019s pledge to defy the \u201cgreed is good\u201d mantra that governs most public companies appealed to investors. Either that, or those investors are tremendously cynical and calculate that in a year or two, all that idealism will fall by the wayside. That is, indeed, the next hurdle that Etsy will face \u2013 and possibly the biggest question facing all B Corps, most of which are smaller, local businesses. Etsy is only the second to have gone public (the first was Rally Software). Another prominent B Corp is Kickstarter.com, but CEO Perry Chen has rejected publicly the idea of an IPO, noting that people give money to Kickstarter projects because they want to see them happen rather than because they want to make money. The most disruptive part of Kickstarter, he added, \u201cis the removal of the investment component\u201d. Until very recently, every publicly traded company out there, from the newest IPO on the block to General Electric, was legally bound to pursue a single goal above all others: maximizing shareholder profits. Famously \u2013 or infamously \u2013 that contributed (along with a sluggish business) to the sale of iconic socially responsible ice cream brand Ben and Jerry\u2019s to global consumer products giant Unilever, undermining its social mission. Now a new kind of business structure is emerging: the benefit corporation. This is distinct from a B Corp: rather than being a designation crafted by a nonprofit organization to winnow out the genuine socially responsible from the pretenders, it\u2019s a legal framework adopted by a growing number of states, with the force of law behind it. Roughly speaking, if you invest in a benefit corporation and decide that you\u2019re not happy that it\u2019s not routing 100% of profits to investors, but instead is using a chunk of those profits to improve the environment, the lives of employees and suppliers or the community in which it does business, you don\u2019t get to sue them and claim that they\u2019re violating their fiduciary duty. For the time being, at least, Etsy may be a B Corp, but it isn\u2019t a benefit corporation: that would require the approval of 90% of their shareholders. But B Lab\u2019s rules call for that to happen by 2017. (That\u2019s four years after Delaware, the state in which Etsy is incorporated, passed its benefit corporation law.) If Etsy shareholders don\u2019t approve the initiative, the company will lose even its B Corp status and become just like any other company out there, unless B Lab changes its own rules. In other words, the clock is ticking, and the degree to which greed and good can really coexist on Wall Street will soon be determined. The slam-dunk success of the IPO suggests that investors are eager to embrace the idea that you don\u2019t have to abandon the pursuit of profit in pursuit of a social mission. But the IPO, rather than being a final verdict on the question, was simply the opening round of the debate. It\u2019s time to grab yourself a front-row seat for what could be one of the most interesting and important discussions about the future of capitalism.",

      "bodyText": "The Chicago broker RJ O\u2019Brien cleared trades for Navinder Sarao, the British man accused of contributing towards the Wall Street\u2019s \u201cflash crash\u201d in 2010, the company has confirmed. The admission came as financial experts raised questions about how a 36-year-old Londoner could have single-handedly caused the 2010 crash that wiped billions of dollars in value off US stocks in seconds. A spokeswoman for RJ O\u2019Brien said the firm \u201chad no involvement in the trading decisions\u201d of the trader, who had previously traded with MF Global, a brokerage that went bust in 2011. Around 20,000 of MF Global\u2019s 38,000 clients were then assumed by RJ O\u2019Brien. The spokeswoman added that RJ O\u2019Brien \u201chad no involvement whatsoever with the individual or his company at the time of the Flash Crash in 2010 or for several years thereafter.\u201d Sarao, 36, from Hounslow, west London, appeared in court in the UK on Wednesday charged with crimes the Department of Justice believes helped cause the Dow Jones industrial average to plunge 600 points in five minutes, wreaking havoc on Wall Street. The DoJ and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have accused Sarao of multiple charges of wire fraud, commodities fraud and market manipulation, and are seeking his extradition to the US. US authorities have offered several explanations for the flash crash, which rattled stock markets worldwide. Sarao\u2019s arrest comes five years after the SEC and CFTC\u2019s official report said the crash was caused in part by an automated sale algorithm at a mutual fund, widely identified as Waddell Reed. There was no mention in the report of Sarao, or an unidentified individual trader that could have been Sarao. Eric Hunsader, chief executive of financial data company Nanex which monitors all market trades, said it was very unlikely that a single trader could have caused the crash \u2013 and questioned why it had taken so long for the authorities to discover Sarao\u2019s suspect trades. \u201cI think he\u2019s a small fish, it\u2019s really disappointing to see the Justice Department laying the blame on a small guy, [it is as if] they are afraid of the big players,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t think they thought this through. If one guy can do this what [could] a well capitalised country or terrorists do? The only thing preventing him from causing total destruction was fear of getting caught. A terrorist wouldn\u2019t have that fear.\u201d Hunsader said trade data also showed that Sarao\u2019s trading algorithm was switched off two minutes before the crash which started at 14:42:44 on 6 May 2010. \u201cThe CTFC had audit trail data [at the time of the report], there\u2019s no way they didn\u2019t know about this,\u201d Hunsader said. \u201cYou cannot miss it; it really is that easy.\u201d The chairman of the CFTC, Tim Massad, on Wednesday defended the agency\u2019s slow action in identifying Sarao\u2019s trades, which were highlighted by a whistleblower. \u201cSometimes it takes a long time to put cases together,\u201d Massad said following a speech in Chicago on Wednesday, according to Reuters. \u201cThese are huge markets. There\u2019s a lot going on.\u201d On Tuesday, Aitan Goelman, the CFTC\u2019s director of enforcement, said the agency believed and intended to prove that Sarao\u2019s conduct was \u201cat least significantly responsible for the order imbalance that in turn was one of the conditions that led to the flash crash\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s the government at its best \u2013 inept,\u201d Rick Fier, director of equity trading at Conifer Securities, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt really is just another one of many things to deal with, it\u2019s extremely frustrating. We\u2019ve seen flash crashes and we\u2019ll see them again and it\u2019s definitely disconcerting.\u201d",

A terrorist wouldn\u2019t have that fear.\u201d<br></p> <p>Hunsader said trade data also showed that Sarao\u2019s trading algorithm was switched off two minutes before the crash which started at 14:42:44 on 6 May 2010.</p> <p>\u201cThe CTFC had audit trail data [at the time of the report], there\u2019s no way they didn\u2019t know about this,\u201d Hunsader said. \u201cYou cannot miss it; it really is that easy.\u201d</p> <p>The chairman of the CFTC, Tim Massad, on Wednesday defended the agency\u2019s slow action in identifying Sarao\u2019s trades, which were highlighted by a whistleblower. <br></p> <p>\u201cSometimes it takes a long time to put cases together,\u201d Massad <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/22/flashcrash-trader-massad-idUSL1N0XJ1J420150422\">said following a speech in Chicago on Wednesday, according to Reuters</a>. \u201cThese are huge markets. There\u2019s a lot going on.\u201d </p> <p>On Tuesday, Aitan Goelman, the CFTC\u2019s director of enforcement, said the agency believed and intended to prove that Sarao\u2019s conduct was \u201cat least significantly responsible for the order imbalance that in turn was one of the conditions that led to the flash crash\u201d.<br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s the government at its best \u2013 inept,\u201d Rick Fier, director of equity trading at Conifer Securities, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-21/spoofed-market-is-latest-reason-to-sweat-for-u-s-stock-managers\">told Bloomberg</a>. \u201cIt really is just another one of many things to deal with, it\u2019s extremely frustrating. We\u2019ve seen flash crashes and we\u2019ll see them again and it\u2019s definitely disconcerting.\u201d<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Retail sales in Britain fell unexpectedly last month, posting a 0.5% decline, against City expectations of a 0.4% increase. A 6.2% fall in petrol sales was the main culprit. Here is what economists made of the numbers. Allan Monks at JP Morgan While there has been a clear slowing from the 9% gains recorded for the fourth quarter, that pace never looked sustainable. The ongoing monthly gains in underlying sales following that quarter are encouraging. Heavy discounting (even after excluding auto fuels) in the retail sector is helping to underpin real spending gains, with scope for further increases to come. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec We are not at all concerned by this apparent slowdown in high street activity as the retail sales series has been exceptionally buoyant in recent months. Even after today\u2019s figures, headline sales volumes stand 4.2% above year ago levels and 3.0% higher than where the index stood six months ago. The latest figures seem to represent a modest break from the relentless surge in sales since last autumn and are not likely to represent a turning point. Indeed at least for now fundamentals remain very supportive with employment rising strongly, pay growth beginning to firm, consumer confidence high and inflation currently at zero. Our suspicion is that household spending will probably play a more significant role in economic growth further ahead than in the earlier phases of the recovery, although this again might be subject to political developments after 7 May. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PricewaterhouseCoopers The retail figures out this morning were somewhat weaker than expected in March (though weighed down by a sharp fall in petrol sales). The underlying trend for the first quarter was still positive (0.9% volume growth relative to the previous quarter), though not as fast as the average growth rate seen in some earlier quarters in 2014. This suggests consumers are still a little cautious, despite the strong fundamentals around jobs growth and low inflation. The figures also confirmed continued strong deflationary pressures on the high street. Even excluding petrol, the implied retail sales deflator was around -2% in the year to Q1 2015, well below overall consumer price inflation of around zero. This reflects the fact that goods prices have been falling, while services prices have generally still been rising. Mike Jervis, retail specialist at PwC Despite the unexpected fall in last month\u2019s retail sales figures, our April consumer outlook survey found that consumers are more confident than they\u2019ve been since before the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 and for the first time, the balance of opinion is positive for the country as a whole driven by the benefits of low unemployment, low inflation and rising real wages. There is no hint of a pre-election wobble, either. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce After strong growth in February, it is not surprising to see a slowdown in retail sales in March. In fact, if you remove the fall in petrol station sales, overall sales rose slightly in March. The underlying trend for the retail sector remains positive, with sales in the first three months of 2015 up by almost 5%. While it is positive to see the retail sector performing well, the UK economy still relies far too heavily on consumer spending, and the contribution of exports and investment remain too low. The next government has to address this as a priority. We need to start a revolution in how we export if we are to see sustainable economic growth. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight Retail sales volumes still grew by a very decent 0.9% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2015, suggesting that consumer spending made a solid contribution to GDP growth. Even so, we suspect that GDP growth slowed to 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2015, which would be down from 0.6% in both the fourth and third quarters of 2014, 0.8% in the second quarter and 0.9% in the first. Concern that GDP growth could have slowed appreciably in the first quarter of 2015 has been fuelled by disappointing industrial production and (especially) construction output data for February as well as weaker trade data. Alan Clarke, economist at Scotiabank Ouch! Not good news for Q1 GDP next week. To be clear, this is far from a disaster. Look at the year-on-year growth rate of circa 5%. That pace of growth is consistent with robust real incomes growth. No need to panic. Nonetheless, at the geeky level, this release is important given what it implies for first-quarter GDP. Yesterday\u2019s MPC minutes played down the weakness of the monthly data that feed into Q1 GDP - I think that was a mistake. Retail sales were really really strong in Q4, and weak in Q1. Overall, disappointing. It may well be that consumers maxed out before Christmas in a discount-fuelled frenzy and the post-Christmas period is experiencing a pause for breath. The monthly data all point towards sluggish Q1 GDP next Tuesday, not the sort of reading that the coalition government will be hoping for.",

      "body": "<p>Sainsbury\u2019s is to cut 800 jobs in its stores as part of plans to save \u00a3500m over the next three years. The supermarket, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/13/sainsbury-500-job-cuts-head-offices-london-coventry-manchester\">which axed 500 head office jobs in January</a>, said it would be cutting department and deputy manager positions in some stores. It is also replacing night shifts with early morning and evening shifts in some stores \u2013 a change it said would improve product availability.</p> <p>Roger Burnley, retail and operations director, said: \u201cThese are exceptionally difficult decisions to make and we have not taken them lightly ... We set out very clearly last year that we have to reflect the changes in when and how our customers are shopping. These proposals will help us maintain and improve customer service by having more colleagues on hand and well-replenished shelves at all times.\u201d </p> <p>The move follows similar decisions by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/17/morrisons-2600-management-jobs-cut-supermarket\" draggable=\"true\">Morrisons</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/03/asda-to-cut-jobs-stores-restructure\" draggable=\"true\">Asda</a>, which cut thousands of store management roles last year. Tesco is finalising 2,500 similar job cuts this month, as well as 2,418 job cuts at its head offices. Even Booths, the upmarket northern grocer, revealed on Thursday that it is consulting on cutting 100 store management jobs and reducing staff hours. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s has begun consultation in more than 100 stores about the way they are restocked overnight. More than 500 roles will be affected, but the company said many night-shift workers could be redeployed or moved to nearby stores.</p> <p> Steve Dresser, an analyst at Grocery Insight, said the job cuts were a recognition of lower volumes and sales at the major supermarkets. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a need for the overnight operation in a quiet store.

      "bodyText": "Sainsbury\u2019s is to cut 800 jobs in its stores as part of plans to save \u00a3500m over the next three years. The supermarket, which axed 500 head office jobs in January, said it would be cutting department and deputy manager positions in some stores. It is also replacing night shifts with early morning and evening shifts in some stores \u2013 a change it said would improve product availability. Roger Burnley, retail and operations director, said: \u201cThese are exceptionally difficult decisions to make and we have not taken them lightly ... We set out very clearly last year that we have to reflect the changes in when and how our customers are shopping. These proposals will help us maintain and improve customer service by having more colleagues on hand and well-replenished shelves at all times.\u201d The move follows similar decisions by Morrisons and Asda, which cut thousands of store management roles last year. Tesco is finalising 2,500 similar job cuts this month, as well as 2,418 job cuts at its head offices. Even Booths, the upmarket northern grocer, revealed on Thursday that it is consulting on cutting 100 store management jobs and reducing staff hours. Sainsbury\u2019s has begun consultation in more than 100 stores about the way they are restocked overnight. More than 500 roles will be affected, but the company said many night-shift workers could be redeployed or moved to nearby stores. Steve Dresser, an analyst at Grocery Insight, said the job cuts were a recognition of lower volumes and sales at the major supermarkets. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a need for the overnight operation in a quiet store. Not when there is a cheaper way to operate that won\u2019t be noticed by customers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another sign that the industry is changing and a byproduct of volume shifting to the discounters and online stores.\u201d All the major supermarkets have seen sales and profits fall thanks to growing competition from discounters including Aldi and Lidl. The grocery market has also been hit by deflation in food commodities after strong harvests around the world, while shoppers continue to keep a tight rein on their budgets after years of tough economic times. The supermarkets need more funds to finance millions of pounds\u2019 worth of price cuts, particularly on everyday basics such as milk, eggs and bread, in order to dissuade their customers from migrating to the low-cost chains. Falling prices drove Sainsbury\u2019s sales at established stores excluding fuel down 1.9% in the 10 weeks to 14 March. It has pledged to spend \u00a3150m on price cuts this year. Management and head office jobs have been targeted by supermarkets as they try to retain superior customer service and more attractive stores than cheaper rivals while reducing costs. Tesco and Morrisons have slashed management roles but added more shop-floor staff in an attempt to boost service.",

Alan Clarke, at Scotiabank, said: \u201cIt may well be that consumers maxed out before Christmas in a discount fuelled frenzy and the post-Christmas period is experiencing a pause for breath.</p> <p>\u201cThe monthly data all point towards sluggish first-quarter GDP \u2026 not the sort of reading that the coalition government will be hoping for.

He said: \u201cConcern that GDP growth could have slowed appreciably in the first quarter of 2015 has been fuelled by disappointing industrial production and (especially) construction output data for February as well as weaker trade data.\u201d<br></p> <p>Many economists were sanguine about the March fall in retail sales, noting that it came after a period of very strong sales growth. They believe that shop discounts \u2013 along with strong employment growth, high consumer confidence and inflation at zero \u2013 will keep households spending in coming months.</p> <p>The ONS figures showed retail sales climbed 0.9% in the three months to March, marking the longest period of continued growth since November 2007.</p> <p> JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said: \u201cHeavy discounting in the retail sector is helping to underpin real spending gains, with scope for further increases to come.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, agreed. \u201cThe latest figures seem to represent a modest break from the relentless surge in sales since last autumn and are not likely to represent a turning point ... Our suspicion is that household spending will probably play a more significant role in economic growth further ahead than in the earlier phases of the recovery, although this again might be subject to political developments after 7 May.\u201d</p> <p>The ONS said March was the first month since June 2014 in which the value of retail sales rose more than the volume, implying an increase in prices, although retail prices are still down significantly on the same month a year ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab1d9eb2316f5f71874124e859e929a8a2d3139c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/23/1429787716553/1b170282-5f31-4d9e-beae-3c8857735da0-460x355.png\" alt=\"Quarterly retail sales growth since 2005\" width=\"460\" height=\"355\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quarterly retail sales growth since 2005.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

The volume of retail sales dropped 0.5% in March from February, with petrol stations reporting a 6.2% decline, the biggest in almost three years, the Office for National Statistics said. The fall wrongfooted City economists, who had been expecting a 0.4% increase. Excluding fuel, retail sales rose 0.2% \u2013 still below City forecasts. The pound took a hit after the figures were released, falling below $1.50. Some economists said the surprise reverse in retail sales was further evidence that economic growth was slowing, following weak industrial production and construction data. Alan Clarke, at Scotiabank, said: \u201cIt may well be that consumers maxed out before Christmas in a discount fuelled frenzy and the post-Christmas period is experiencing a pause for breath. \u201cThe monthly data all point towards sluggish first-quarter GDP \u2026 not the sort of reading that the coalition government will be hoping for. Prior to these numbers my gut feel was 0.5% quarter-on-quarter [for GDP], but I\u2019m now toying with 0.4%.\u201d Howard Archer, at IHS Global Insight, is predicting 0.5% GDP growth in the first quarter following 0.6% rises in each of the previous two. He said: \u201cConcern that GDP growth could have slowed appreciably in the first quarter of 2015 has been fuelled by disappointing industrial production and (especially) construction output data for February as well as weaker trade data.\u201d Many economists were sanguine about the March fall in retail sales, noting that it came after a period of very strong sales growth. They believe that shop discounts \u2013 along with strong employment growth, high consumer confidence and inflation at zero \u2013 will keep households spending in coming months. The ONS figures showed retail sales climbed 0.9% in the three months to March, marking the longest period of continued growth since November 2007. JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said: \u201cHeavy discounting in the retail sector is helping to underpin real spending gains, with scope for further increases to come.\u201d Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, agreed. \u201cThe latest figures seem to represent a modest break from the relentless surge in sales since last autumn and are not likely to represent a turning point ... Our suspicion is that household spending will probably play a more significant role in economic growth further ahead than in the earlier phases of the recovery, although this again might be subject to political developments after 7 May.\u201d The ONS said March was the first month since June 2014 in which the value of retail sales rose more than the volume, implying an increase in prices, although retail prices are still down significantly on the same month a year ago.",

      "bodyText": "1977 \u2013 As economic problems hit, Tesco\u2019s UK chief executive Ian (now Lord) MacLaurin initiates the Operation Checkout price cut plan in an attempt to boost sales, starting a price war with Sainsbury\u2019s. He also ditches the Green Shield Stamps saving scheme, which had been a key part of the business for 15 years, saving \u00a320m to fund price cuts. The group goes on to close 500 unprofitable stores and revamps others with wider aisles and better lighting. 1979 \u2013 Sales reach \u00a31bn. 1982 \u2013 MacLaurin launches Checkout \u201882 \u2013 cutting prices by between 3% and 26% on about 1,500 food items, again kicking off a price war with Sainsbury\u2019s. Sales reach \u00a32bn. 1985 \u2013 Tesco begins aggressive programme of store and warehouse expansion and puts in more technology. 1993 \u2013 With the UK in recession, Tesco launches its Value range \u2013 under the \u201cevery little helps\u201d strapline \u2013 aimed at fighting off discounters including KwikSave, Aldi and Netto. The group makes its first foray abroad with acquisition of Catteau, a 92-store chain in France. The business is sold off four years later as it struggles against bigger rivals and discounters. 1994 \u2013 Tesco heads overseas again with the purchase of Hungary\u2019s S-Market, kicking off a phase of international expansion that takes the retailer as far as China, Korea and Turkey. 1995 \u2013 Knocking rival Sainsbury\u2019s off the top slot, Tesco becomes Britain\u2019s biggest food retailer. The Clubcard is launched. 1997 \u2013 Terry Leahy takes over as chief executive and Tesco opens its first Tesco Extra hypermarket in Pitsea, Essex. 2000 \u2013 Tesco.com launched. 2003 \u2013 T&amp;S Stores taken over, adding 870 local convenience shops. 2005 \u2013 Profits top \u00a32bn. 2007 \u2013 Tesco enters the US, announcing plans for hundreds of Fresh &amp; Easy stores. UK market share reaches a high of 31.2%. 2009 \u2013 Tesco Bank launched. 2010 \u2013 Sir Terry Leahy, by now regarded as one of Britain\u2019s most successful businessmen, announces plans to retire after a 14-year stint as chief executive saying he felt he had achieved his aim to \u201cdevelop a purpose and values that could sustain Tesco through its challenges\u201d. 2011 \u2013 Phil Clarke becomes chief executive in March just before announcing record profits of \u00a33.8bn. The Big Price Drop, a \u00a3500m price-cutting plan is launched at the end of the year, but the strategy fails as shoppers are not convinced by the savings on offer. The group sells up in Japan after eight years. 2012 \u2013 Clarke unveils a \u00a31bn makeover of stores and its website as UK profits fall. Tesco\u2019s crown as the UK\u2019s most successful retailer slips further as it finally calls time on its loss-making US business, Fresh &amp; Easy, costing it \u00a31.8bn in six years, the biggest-ever British retail failure in the US. Tesco had put \u00a31bn into its US business, and its original plan was for a chain of 1,000 stores on the west coast, and then a move to the east coast too. The failure of the US operation costs the retailer\u2019s deputy chief executive, Tim Mason, his job. 2013 \u2013 Tesco reveals its first annual profit drop in 20 years and says it will not open more hypermarkets. 2014 \u2013 Tesco starts the year with a profits warning after poor Christmas sales. A \u00a3200m price cuts campaign launched as Tesco\u2019s market share shrinks to 28.7%, the lowest level in a decade, under attack from discounters Aldi and Lidl and Morrisons, which cuts its prices. Clarke, who insisted in April that he was \u201cnot going anywhere\u201d, is ousted in July after yet another profit warning. He is to stay on until October when he will be replaced by Dave Lewis, head of Unilever\u2019s personal care business. Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s cuts Tesco\u2019s credit rating on 7 August, sending its shares down to a new 10-year low. On 29 August, Tesco releases its third profit warning for the year, slashes its dividend by 75% and announces that new boss Lewis will start a month earlier than expected, on 1 September. \u201cHe will be reviewing all aspects of the group,\u201d the retailer said. 22 September \u2013 Tesco shares slump as it admits that profits were overstated by \u00a3250m. Four executives are suspended. The same week, major investor BlackRock reveals it sold down its stake in the supermarket, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s put its credit rating under review \u2013 and the business select committee chairman Adrian Bailey says executives may have to face MPs over its \u201cstratospheric error\u201d. \u2022 Tesco confirms it has not had a finance director for five months. \u2022 Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley takes a \u00a343m punt on Tesco shares recovering. 1 October \u2013 Dave Lewis launches Feet on the Floor initiative, sending thousands of head office staff, including senior executives, to work in stores for one day a fortnight in stores in the runup to Christmas. The Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, launches its own investigation into the accounting scandal. 2 October \u2013 Investor Warren Buffett says buying shares in Tesco was \u201ca huge mistake\u201d. 3 October \u2013 It emerges that Tesco has taken delivery of a new $50m (\u00a331m) Gulfstream G550 corporate jet. 6 October \u2013 Tesco recruits Mikael Ohlsson, the former boss of Ikea, and Compass chief executive Richard Cousins as non-executive directors. 14 October \u2013 Tesco suspends another three executives as part of probe into accounting scandal taking total to eight. 16 October \u2013 Warren Buffett sells off more of his Tesco shareholding. 23 October \u2013 Tesco publishes its delayed interim results, showing not only that the black hole was bigger than expected, at \u00a3263m, but that the accounting errors stretched back at least two years. Pretax profits plunged 92% to \u00a3112m. Chairman Sir Richard Broadbent is to resign. Dave Lewis, who said the group was unable to offer any guidance on full-year profit, gave no hints on his strategy. 28 November \u2013 Black Friday turns into a disaster for the group as police are called to restore order in at least 16 stores where staff were overwhelmed by bargain-hunting customers. A senior policeman later refers to the scenes in some of its supermarkets as akin to a mini-riot and scolded senior executives, arguing that the force\u2019s \u201cscarce resources should not be used to bail out stores when they\u2019ve not planned effectively\u201d. 1 December \u2013 It is announced that Dave Lewis will take over the day-to-day running of the embattled supermarket\u2019s UK chain as it heads into the crucial Christmas trading weeks, despite previously admitting that he had never run a shop in his life. 4 December \u2013 It became clear that Tesco\u2019s website was unable to cope with the number of orders placed on Black Friday. Customers complained of long delays on click-and-collect orders or missing out completely because products ordered during the promotional extravaganza had sold out. 9 December \u2013 Dave Lewis marks his 100th day in charge with another grim profits warning. In an unscheduled trading update, Britain\u2019s biggest retailer says trading profit for the current financial year will be no higher than \u00a31.4bn. City analysts had been expecting the company to make between \u00a31.8bn and \u00a32.2bn. A year ago, it made \u00a33.3bn. 28 January 2015 \u2013 Tesco names 43 stores to close in turnaround plan. 30 January \u2013 Company cuts range of products by 30% to simplify shopping. 17 February \u2013 Tesco appoints John Allan, chairman of housebuilder Barratt, as new chair. 20 March \u2013 Tesco takes full ownership of 21 superstores in deal with British Land. 23 March \u2013 Tesco director Patrick Cescau, who led the boardroom shake-up, quits. 30 March \u2013 Tesco faces US lawsuit over profit overstatement.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Wednesday\u2019s low inflation figures would normally suggest the Reserve Bank could cut interest rates. But the breakdown of the figures shows that housing prices continue to remain solid and the reasons for the low inflation have mostly washed through the system. Thus, while the low inflation figures do give the RBA room to move on interest rates, there is little in the figures to suggest they actually will. We live in a funny world at the moment. Yesterday\u2019s latest consumer price index figures showed that in the March quarter inflation rose just 0.2% and in the past 12 months it grew just 1.3%. That level of annual growth is less than half the 20-year average of 2.7%, and yet in response the price of the Australian dollar jumped about 0.8% as the market took the numbers to suggest the chances of another rate cut were reduced. The annual growth of 1.3% is the third lowest inflation growth figure in the past 15 years. And the past six months has seen average prices grow by such a meagre amount that were they to be replicated over the next six months, inflation would have grown by just 0.8% in the year. So why was this low figure ignored by the market? Mostly it is because it was driven by one-off factors such as the removal of the carbon price, and by prices which fell but have since started to rise. Chief among this last aspect is that of petrol prices. Transport costs \u2013 which include automotive fuel, motor vehicles and public transport fares \u2013 contributed most to the weak inflation growth. It detracted around 0.4 percentage points from the quarterly inflation figure. Automotive fuel (which accounts for nearly a third of all costs in the transport group) fell 13% in the March quarter alone, and 22.4% over the past year \u2013 making it easily the biggest fall of any item in those periods: But the ABS noted that while its measure of automotive fuel fell in the March quarter, in reality petrol prices across the country are now about 15% higher than they were on 1 January this year. The problem for the ABS is that each quarter it records the average of prices for the past three months. Thus, while on 1 January the average price of petrol was around $1.20 a litre, for the first six weeks it fell below that price. From the middle of February to the end of March, however, it rose above the $1.20 a litre mark \u2013 to around $1.38. Thus the average fuel price for the March quarter was around $1.20 \u2013 13% below the average December quarter price of around $1.38 \u2013 but that price is no longer available. And given fuel prices were such a major contributor to the low CPI figure, it means the level of inflation recorded in the March quarter is very much in the rear view mirror. This is reflected in the \u201ccore inflation\u201d measure used by the RBA of \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d and \u201cweighted median\u201d, sitting on 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. These measures, which attempt to filter out one-off events, are pretty much bang in the middle on the RBA\u2019s 2.5% to 3% target inflation range: The low fuel prices also led to the fall in the price of tradable goods. These goods are those that have their price mostly determined overseas (or on the world market). In the past year they fell 0.9%, while the prices of non-tradables rose 2.6%: When the Reserve Bank worries about inflation, it realises there is not a lot it can do to affect the world price \u2013 raising or cutting interest rates will have no impact at all on the price we pay for oil. And in the past it has reacted to increased inflation mostly when the non-tradable prices (goods and services like houses, electricity, education, health) have sharply increased \u2013 such as during 2007-08 and in 2010. But 2.6% is no cause for concern, although the past six months has seen a slight uptick, which would have the RBA at least raising an eyebrow. And, as is often the case, that eyebrow would be directed towards house prices. The CPI figure only counts the price of new dwellings bought for owner occupier purposes, and thus doesn\u2019t count all the houses bought by investors. But nevertheless it gives a nice indication of how housing prices are going. And as usual they are going a lot more in Sydney than anywhere else. In Sydney, new dwelling prices increased by 7.2% in the past year. The next biggest increase was in Melbourne, where prices rose by 4.9%. On Wednesday, the governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens, suggested in a speech to the American Australian Association that in his opinion \u201cpopular commentary\u201d was \u201ctoo focused on Sydney prices and pays too little attention to the more disparate trends among the other 80% of Australia\u201d. And certainly Sydney does get most of the attention. But it says something about the size and influence of the Sydney housing market that the average rise of new dwelling prices across the nation was 4.8% \u2013 meaning that Sydney effectively cancelled out the much smaller increases in Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Hobart, Canberra and Darwin. Moreover, these figures do nothing to disavow Stevens\u2019s view that \u201cit is hard to escape the conclusion that Sydney prices \u2026 look rather exuberant\u201d. The difficulty for the RBA is that when worrying about inflation it needs to worry about the impact of interest rates across the economy \u2013 you can\u2019t just set interest rates for one state. And while lower interest rates do eventually have an impact on prices through increased demand, the most immediate and direct impact is on the price of housing. And when you look at new dwelling prices across Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide compared with overall inflation in the past four years, the difficulty for the RBA is apparent: Since March 2011, Sydney\u2019s new dwelling prices have risen 17.9%, compared with a rise in overall inflation of just 8.7%. But prices in Melbourne and Adelaide over that period actually rose less than inflation. And while Brisbane and Perth saw new dwelling prices in the past four years rise faster than inflation, only in Sydney and Melbourne are those prices now rising faster than the 15-year average. And thus the battle on interest rates will continue to be one of trying to induce growth into the economy, while hoping that doing so does not induce housing prices to become any more \u201cexuberant\u201d than they already are. In the past, 1.3% inflation would be a signal for the RBA to cut rates. This quarter\u2019s figures, if anything, would have them hitting the pause button.",

      "body": "<p>Wednesday\u2019s low inflation figures would normally suggest the Reserve Bank could cut interest rates. But the breakdown of the figures shows that housing prices continue to remain solid and the reasons for the low inflation have mostly washed through the system. Thus, while the low inflation figures do give the RBA room to move on interest rates, there is little in the figures to suggest they actually will.</p> <p>We live in a funny world at the moment. Yesterday\u2019s latest <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/6401.0Main+Features1Mar%202015?OpenDocument\">consumer price index figures</a> showed that in the March quarter inflation rose just 0.2% and in the past 12 months it grew just 1.3%. That level of annual growth is less than half the 20-year average of 2.7%, and yet in response the price of the Australian dollar jumped about 0.8% as the market took the numbers to suggest the chances of another rate cut were reduced.</p> <p>The annual growth of 1.3% is the third lowest inflation growth figure in the past 15 years. And the past six months has seen average prices grow by such a meagre amount that were they to be replicated over the next six months, inflation would have grown by just 0.8% in the year. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/EecQe/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>So why was this low figure ignored by the market? Mostly it is because it was driven by one-off factors such as the removal of the carbon price, and by prices which fell but have since started to rise. Chief among this last aspect is that of petrol prices.</p> <p>Transport costs \u2013 which include automotive fuel, motor vehicles and public transport fares \u2013 contributed most to the weak inflation growth. It detracted around 0.4 percentage points from the quarterly inflation figure. Automotive fuel (which accounts for nearly a third of all costs in the transport group) fell 13% in the March quarter alone, and 22.4% over the past year \u2013 making it easily the biggest fall of any item in those periods:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/Xb8AV/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>But the ABS noted that while its measure of automotive fuel fell in the March quarter, in reality petrol prices across the country are now about 15% higher than they were on 1 January this year. </p> <p>The problem for the ABS is that each quarter it records the average of prices for the past three months. Thus, while on 1 January the average price of petrol was around $1.20 a litre, for the first six weeks it fell below that price. From the middle of February to the end of March, however, it rose above the $1.20 a litre mark \u2013 to around $1.38. </p> <p>Thus the average fuel price for the March quarter was around $1.20 \u2013 13% below the average December quarter price of around $1.38 \u2013 but that price is no longer available. </p> <p>And given fuel prices were such a major contributor to the low CPI figure, it means the level of inflation recorded in the March quarter is very much in the rear view mirror. </p> <p>This is reflected in the \u201ccore inflation\u201d measure used by the RBA of \u201ctrimmed mean\u201d and \u201cweighted median\u201d, sitting on 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. These measures, which attempt to filter out one-off events, are pretty much bang in the middle on the RBA\u2019s 2.5% to 3% target inflation range:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/t9oCK/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The low fuel prices also led to the fall in the price of tradable goods. These goods are those that have their price mostly determined overseas (or on the world market). In the past year they fell 0.9%, while the prices of non-tradables rose 2.6%:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/0h42u/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>When the Reserve Bank worries about inflation, it realises there is not a lot it can do to affect the world price \u2013 raising or cutting interest rates will have no impact at all on the price we pay for oil. And in the past it has reacted to increased inflation mostly when the non-tradable prices (goods and services like houses, electricity, education, health) have sharply increased \u2013 such as during 2007-08 and in 2010.</p> <p>But 2.6% is no cause for concern, although the past six months has seen a slight uptick, which would have the RBA at least raising an eyebrow. </p> <p>And, as is often the case, that eyebrow would be directed towards house prices. The CPI figure only counts the price of new dwellings bought for owner occupier purposes, and thus doesn\u2019t count all the houses bought by investors. But nevertheless it gives a nice indication of how housing prices are going. </p> <p>And as usual they are going a lot more in Sydney than anywhere else. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/NXqSw/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In Sydney, new dwelling prices increased by 7.2% in the past year. The next biggest increase was in Melbourne, where prices rose by 4.9%. </p> <p>On Wednesday, the governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens, suggested in a <a href=\"http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-gov-2015-04-21.html\">speech</a> to the American Australian Association that in his opinion \u201cpopular commentary\u201d was \u201ctoo focused on Sydney prices and pays too little attention to the more disparate trends among the other 80% of Australia\u201d.</p> <p>And certainly Sydney does get most of the attention. But it says something about the size and influence of the Sydney housing market that the average rise of new dwelling prices across the nation was 4.8% \u2013 meaning that Sydney effectively cancelled out the much smaller increases in Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Hobart, Canberra and Darwin. </p> <p>Moreover, these figures do nothing to disavow Stevens\u2019s view that \u201cit is hard to escape the conclusion that Sydney prices \u2026 look rather exuberant\u201d. </p> <p>The difficulty for the RBA is that when worrying about inflation it needs to worry about the impact of interest rates across the economy \u2013 you can\u2019t just set interest rates for one state. And while lower interest rates do eventually have an impact on prices through increased demand, the most immediate and direct impact is on the price of housing. </p> <p>And when you look at new dwelling prices across Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide compared with overall inflation in the past four years, the difficulty for the RBA is apparent:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/UiwP6/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since March 2011, Sydney\u2019s new dwelling prices have risen 17.9%, compared with a rise in overall inflation of just 8.7%. But prices in Melbourne and Adelaide over that period actually rose less than inflation. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;\">  <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/wkHht/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And while Brisbane and Perth saw new dwelling prices in the past four years rise faster than inflation, only in Sydney and Melbourne are those prices now rising faster than the 15-year average.</p> <p>And thus the battle on interest rates will continue to be one of trying to induce growth into the economy, while hoping that doing so does not induce housing prices to become any more \u201cexuberant\u201d than they already are. In the past, 1.3% inflation would be a signal for the RBA to cut rates. This quarter\u2019s figures, if anything, would have them hitting the pause button.</p>",
