      "bodyText": "The British and French governments have insisted the Hinkley Point nuclear plant is on track, despite fresh doubts emerging over the \u00a318bn project after an executive row at its main backer, EDF Energy. EDF confirmed that finance chief Thomas Piquemal had resigned, amid reports he wanted the French state-owned company to delay a final decision on building the UK\u2019s first new nuclear power station in a generation. French trade unions latched on to Piquemal\u2019s departure as evidence that the Hinkley Point C plant, which is expected to meet 7% of the UK\u2019s energy needs once up and running, poses a threat to EDF\u2019s future. Analysts echoed the finance director\u2019s concerns, with one energy expert saying that the project to build two nuclear reactors on the Somerset coast was \u201cverging on insanity\u201d. Labour called on the government to come up with a \u201cPlan B\u201d, in case EDF pulls out. But EDF and the UK and French governments said the project would go ahead as planned, with a final decision due to be taken in the \u201cnear future\u201d. Jean-Bernard Levy, the chairman of 85% state-owned EDF, said he regretted the \u201chaste\u201d of Piquemal\u2019s departure. \u201cWith the support of its shareholder, the state, EDF can confirm that it is looking to invest in two reactors at Hinkley Point under the best possible financial conditions for the group,\u201d said Levy in a statement. A Downing Street spokesman said the British government would not \u201cspeculate on the resignation of one individual\u201d but added that \u201cwe continue to fully support the project\u201d. French economy minister Emmanuel Macron also reiterated his government\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d for Hinkley, which he said would be \u201cvery profitable\u201d over the next 30 years. But critics said the plan, which would see nuclear power produced at Hinkley from 2025, was being driven by political will rather than business sense. \u201cPolitics is rather trumping the economics at the moment,\u201d said Tim Yeo, the former Tory MP who chairs pro-nuclear lobby group New Nuclear Watch. He said the government should put the project on hold and consider potentially cheaper nuclear technologies from South Korea, China and Russia. Yeo added: \u201cNow is the moment for the government to examine whether these alternatives represent value for money. We need to cast the net a bit wider.\u201d The government has faced criticism for agreeing to guarantee EDF a price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt hour for energy produced at Hinkley. But EDF\u2019s \u20ac37bn (\u00a329bn) debt pile, coupled with the impact on its day-to-day income from low energy prices, has led to fears that it cannot afford to proceed even with such a substantial subsidy. Force Ouvri\u00e8re, a french trade union, said that Piquemal\u2019s departure showed they were right to be concerned about the impact of Hinkley on EDF\u2019s long-term financial health. Serge Gianorsi, Force Ouvri\u00e8re\u2019s trade union secretary, said: \u201cThe resignation of such a high-ranking executive is pretty spectacular and shows the disagreement even at the highest levels.\u201d Martin Young, an energy analyst at investment bank RBC Capital Markets, said that for EDF to proceed with such a costly plan would be \u201cverging on insanity\u201d. He said the firm would have to sell assets in the \u201cdouble-digit\u201d billions to afford the project. EDF was initially looking for a partner to fund 49% of the project but has only been able to secure investment to cover 33% of its cost from China\u2019s state-owned China General Nuclear. Young added that EDF was under pressure to push ahead with the project because it uses European pressurised reactors [EPR], a technology that France hopes will be a lucrative export for its nuclear industry. EPR reactors being built at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in Finland have met with huge cost overruns and lengthy delays. \u201cTo walk away from the project would be a blow to French aspirations to be a major force in the nuclear world,\u201d said Young. \u201cIf they walk away from doing this, they\u2019re admitting that EPR has failed.\u201d Peter Atherton, an energy analyst at investment banking firm Jefferies, said that despite these problems, the British government was determined to press on for fear of missing legally binding targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Atherton said: \u201cThe biggest problem the government would have is that without a large nuclear programme it\u2019s very difficult to see how you can hit climate change targets. It\u2019s being driven by those targets, not economics or security of supply. \u201cAlarm bells have been ringing on this project for some time but the two governments are determined to push it though.\u201d He added that EDF might struggle to find buyers for its assets as it tries to raise cash to fund the project. Labour\u2019s shadow energy secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the government should say what alternative options it has in place in the event that EDF walks away. \u201cThis power station is absolutely central to the government\u2019s strategy for keeping the lights on and meeting Britain\u2019s international commitments on climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cWith growing scepticism over whether it will now be built, ministers must tell us what is their plan B.\u201d Kevin Coyne, national officer for energy at the Unite trade union, said EDF should follow the lead of the British and French governments by confirming that Hinkley will go ahead. \u201cWe want to unpack the boots and shovels and get on with the job,\u201d he added.",

    "webTitle": "Finally, someone at EDF sees the \u00a318bn farce that is Hinkley Point", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Hallelujah, at last somebody close to Hinkley Point farce can see that the \u00a318bn nuclear adventure makes no sense. EDF\u2019s finance director has quit rather than be associated with a project that \u2013 we must assume \u2013 he judges so financially risky that it could sink the French energy firm. Last week, the official line from the Anglo-French summit maintained that \u201cmajor progress\u201d was being made in getting Hinkley towards sign-off. The reality, we can now see, is that there has been a major row and EDF remains mired in confusion. The good news is that Thomas Piquemal\u2019s resignation should oblige the governments of France and the UK to acknowledge the uncomfortable fact about Hinkley that, until now, they have preferred to brush away. It\u2019s simple: EDF\u2019s nuclear technology for Hinkley hasn\u2019t been proven to work. Until it can be shown to be reliable, there will always be a material risk that the Somerset project becomes a disaster for both buyer and supplier. EDF is building two other reactors in Europe to the same European pressurised reactor (EPR) design and, instead of low-carbon nuclear power, both have produced only massive cost overruns. The plant in Finland is nine years late and the one in Flamanville in Normandy is four years behind schedule. EDF\u2019s crisis flows from those flops and Piquemal\u2019s analysis that the company can\u2019t afford to double-down on its EPR bet is surely correct. As it is, the debt-laden firm\u2019s share price has fallen 90% over the past decade and there are other calls on its capital and resources, not least France\u2019s nuclear power stations, which require an expensive upgrade. The now ex-finance director wanted the investment decision on Hinkley to be delayed by three years, which would be wise from EDF\u2019s point of view. The trouble is, the UK cannot afford yet more delays. Our crisis in energy generation will arrive in the mid-2020s and Hinkley, according to the official script, was supposed to do much more than merely produce 7% of the UK\u2019s energy. The plant was also intended to help develop the infrastructure to support other companies\u2019 new nuclear plants. If Hinkley were to be delayed by three years, the UK hasn\u2019t got an energy policy worthy of the name. The latest saga should lead to a simple conclusion in Downing Street: EDF and its unreliable EPRs were always the wrong choice for the UK. Consider how many subsidies have already been promised to compensate for EDF\u2019s weaknesses and the unproven nature of its EPR. EDF was given 10 years to build Hinkley and the UK guaranteed to buy its output at twice the current wholesale price for 35 years in an inflation-linked contract. This was almost case of pricing in the cost over-runs and delays before they had even happened, with UK consumers footing the bill. The best approach now would be to call the whole thing off. EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy may continue to whistle cheerfully about Hinkley but his company looks to be only one more resignation away from capitulation. Abandonment would be politically embarrassing for chancellor George Osborne (remember last year\u2019s grovel for Chinese cash to shore up the financing) but it would be far worse to let this show drag on. If the UK\u2019s future is nuclear, there are alternative suppliers \u2013 from Japan, the US, and China \u2013 who have smaller models that can be built more quickly, but their willingness to commit capital won\u2019t be encouraged by the sight of the current Hinkley shambles. If the future is non-nuclear, then get on with the job of making hard choices about the best infrastructure. Either way, the important thing for the UK is to have an energy policy that doesn\u2019t rely on paying top-dollar to an over-stretched supplier that hasn\u2019t been able to get its new kit to work. Banking reforms look set to disappoint The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s final report into the banking industry, due in May, will now appear in the dog days of August. This is not because the contents will be so frightening that leading bankers will need to lie down on the nearest beach. We already know the CMA has rejected structural reforms, such as a break-up of the big banks, in favour of technocratic fiddles, such as setting up a comparison website to encourage punters to shop around. Such a remedy was damned as feeble by most observers when it was announced at the interim stage last October. That, presumably, is why the CMA has given itself an extension to come up with something that sounds more chunky. Caps on overdraft charges and grace periods for customers to avoid the same charges may improve the lot of a few. But none of these late additions by the CMA will deliver a shot in the arm for competition in the banking industry. Blame Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank has turned the process of separating 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches into something resembling the labours of Hercules, thereby killing all appetite for further structural reform. Thus the \u201cstriking\u201d stability in market shares identified by the CMA is virtually guaranteed to be striking in another decade\u2019s time. The interim report felt like a missed opportunity; prepare to be disappointed again. SNP donor in tax pickle Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish first minister and leader of Scottish National party, is a fierce opponent of the artificial tax tactics of some major companies. So, here you would think, is an open goal \u2013 a court defeat for a Scottish company that used a complex scheme to wipe \u00a311m off its tax bill. The company is Stagecoach, whose chairman, Sir Brian Souter, happens to have been a major donor to the SNP. Sturgeon\u2019s condemnation, one trusts, will be forthcoming anyway.",

      "body": "<p>Hallelujah, at last somebody close to Hinkley Point farce can see that the \u00a318bn nuclear adventure makes no sense. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/edf-unions-call-for-hinkley-point-project-to-be-postponed\">EDF\u2019s finance director has quit</a> rather than be associated with a project that \u2013 we must assume \u2013 he judges so financially risky that it could sink the French energy firm. Last week, the official line from the Anglo-French summit maintained that \u201cmajor progress\u201d was being made in getting Hinkley towards sign-off. The reality, we can now see, is that there has been a major row and EDF remains mired in confusion.</p> <p>The good news is that Thomas Piquemal\u2019s resignation should oblige the governments of France and the UK to acknowledge the uncomfortable fact about Hinkley that, until now, they have preferred to brush away. It\u2019s simple: EDF\u2019s nuclear technology for Hinkley hasn\u2019t been proven to work. Until it can be shown to be reliable, there will always be a material risk that the Somerset project becomes a disaster for both buyer and supplier.</p> <p>EDF is building two other reactors in Europe to the same European pressurised reactor (EPR) design and, instead of low-carbon nuclear power, both have produced only massive cost overruns. The plant in Finland is nine years late and the one in Flamanville in Normandy is four years behind schedule.</p> <p>EDF\u2019s crisis flows from those flops and Piquemal\u2019s analysis that the company can\u2019t afford to double-down on its EPR bet is surely correct. As it is, the debt-laden firm\u2019s share price has fallen 90% over the past decade and there are other calls on its capital and resources, not least France\u2019s nuclear power stations, which require an expensive upgrade.</p> <p>The now ex-finance director wanted the investment decision on Hinkley to be delayed by three years, which would be wise from EDF\u2019s point of view. The trouble is, the UK cannot afford yet more delays. Our crisis in energy generation will arrive in the mid-2020s and Hinkley, according to the official script, was supposed to do much more than merely produce 7% of the UK\u2019s energy. The plant was also intended to help develop the infrastructure to support other companies\u2019 new nuclear plants. If Hinkley were to be delayed by three years, the UK hasn\u2019t got an energy policy worthy of the name.</p> <p>The latest saga should lead to a simple conclusion in Downing Street: EDF and its unreliable EPRs were always the wrong choice for the UK. Consider how many subsidies have already been promised to compensate for EDF\u2019s weaknesses and the unproven nature of its EPR. EDF was given 10 years to build Hinkley and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/21/hinkley-point-reactor-costs-rise-by-2bn-as-deal-confirmed\">the UK guaranteed to buy its output at twice the current wholesale price for 35 years in an inflation-linked contract</a>. This was almost case of pricing in the cost over-runs and delays before they had even happened, with UK consumers footing the bill.</p> <p>The best approach now would be to call the whole thing off. EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy may continue to whistle cheerfully about Hinkley but his company looks to be only one more resignation away from capitulation. Abandonment would be politically embarrassing for chancellor George Osborne (remember last year\u2019s grovel for Chinese cash to shore up the financing) but it would be far worse to let this show drag on.</p> <p>If the UK\u2019s future is nuclear, there are alternative suppliers \u2013 from Japan, the US, and China \u2013 who have smaller models that can be built more quickly, but their willingness to commit capital won\u2019t be encouraged by the sight of the current Hinkley shambles. If the future is non-nuclear, then get on with the job of making hard choices about the best infrastructure.</p> <p>Either way, the important thing for the UK is to have an energy policy that doesn\u2019t rely on paying top-dollar to an over-stretched supplier that hasn\u2019t been able to get its new kit to work.</p> <h2>Banking reforms look set to disappoint</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9779f8cd8346739e91b8e59178845559fb6652d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9779f8cd8346739e91b8e59178845559fb6652d/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"High street banks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The banking watchdog has rejected structural reforms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s final report into the banking industry, due in May, will now appear in the dog days of August. This is not because the contents will be so frightening that leading bankers will need to lie down on the nearest beach.

That, presumably, is why the CMA has given itself an extension to come up with something that sounds more chunky. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/07/bank-customers-overdraft-fees-could-be-capped-say-regulators\">Caps on overdraft charges</a> and grace periods for customers to avoid the same charges may improve the lot of a few. But none of these late additions by the CMA will deliver a shot in the arm for competition in the banking industry.</p> <p>Blame Royal Bank of Scotland. The bank has turned the process of separating 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches into something resembling the labours of Hercules, thereby killing all appetite for further structural reform. Thus the \u201cstriking\u201d stability in market shares identified by the CMA is virtually guaranteed to be striking in another decade\u2019s time.

    "webTitle": "Greece: Eurogroup says debt talks on the table, troika to return to Athens \u2013as it happened", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Eurogroup has said debt relief talks for Greece are on the table, but are dependent on the necessary reforms to tax and pensions. More work is needed, and the Eurogroup called on the institutions and the Greek government to put extra effort in to reach agreement. Representatives of the creditors - the troika - will return to Athens tomorrow, but the process needs to be speeded up, so the debt relief talks will be brought forward. On that note it\u2019s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Klaus Regling, head of the eurozone rescue fund the ESM, said Greek liquidity was getting tighter but: Will the debt issue be part of the first review? Dijsselbloem: The review is on the implementation of what was agreed so debt relief not part of that. But there is a strong link between the two. We have agreed there should be fiscal targets and pension reform, so fiscal sustainability long term will be part of debt discussions. [To bring them together} we need to speed up review process and bring forward debt discussion, which could allow us to reach political agreement. Was there discussion about debt relief today? Dijsselbloem: We did not, but I flagged to my colleagues that discussions about debt relief would need to come in the short term future. As soon as we know the outcome on reforms and tax etc then we know what the remaining issue of debt relief will be. And after a final question on Portugal the press conference ends. The review was said to be completed by Easter but that is not straightforward: IMF have asked for more to be done, and also made strong debt relief case, are you in that camp now? Dijsselbloem: Have to be more on table than there is now or it will not work. Not in any camp but there is a link between depth of reforms and any remaining debt issue. More you do on reform, smaller fiscal gaps will be and less of a debt issue there will be in the future. We will put pressure on all sides to make sure it adds up, as IMF says. Questions: Could debt talks start before completion of review? Dijsselbloem: Need to know the outcome of the reforms, but there is going to be a point where all this comes together. On other matters, the Eurogroup says Italy\u2019s high debt burden remains a concern. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he was very happy with the agreement. It would allow the mission chiefs (the creditors\u2019 representatives) to go to Athens as soon as tomorrow to lead discussions on a review of the agreement. He said there were five issues in particular: establish a privatisation fund; reform income tax; reform pensions; create independent revenue agency; cope with non-performing loans. He said they would work with Greece on steps to achieve a 3.5% primary surplus in 2018. The troika will return to Athens, confirms Jeroen Dijsselbloem, head of the Eurogroup at a press conference following today\u2019s meeting. But he said more effort needed to be put in to get a good outcome, and there were still fiscal gaps to be filled and some reforms needed to be deepened. He called on the institutions (the creditors) and in particular the Greek government to put in the extra effort. On debt, they had said if the Greek government delivered a primary surplus \u201cwe would do what was necessary to make [the] debt manageable.\u201d He said they had now made explicit that those discussions would be on the table. Here\u2019s European Commission vice presdient Valdis Dombrovskis on the situation with Greece: A rebound in oil - above $40 a barrel for the first time since December - and metal prices - iron ore in particular - has lifted commodity companies and helped leading shares in Europe recover some of their early losses. Markets ended mostly lower, hit by gloomy comments from the Bank of International Settlements and some profit taking ahead of the European Central Bank\u2019s interest rate-setting meeting this week. But the strength in commodities and a rally on Wall Street after an early dip helped European markets to recover some ground. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 17.03 points or 0.27% at 6182.40 having earlier fallen as low as 6125 Germany\u2019s Dax dipped 0.46% to 9778.93 France\u2019s Cac closed down 0.32% at 4442.29 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.2% to 18,059.27 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.28% at 8786.8 But in Greece, the Athens market added 1.19% to 559.44 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 57 points or 0.34%. Cyprus has exited its bailout programme ahead of schedule, and here\u2019s a statement from the managing director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde: More on the prospect of talks over debt relief for Greece. Reuters reports: The head of the Eurogroup Jeroen Dijsselbloem asked euro zone finance ministers meeting on Monday to prepare to start talks on debt relief for Greece in April, a euro zone official said. Talks on the debt relief can only start once Greece\u2019s lenders -- euro zone governments and the International Monetary Fund -- agree that the country has delivered on reforms pledged in August in exchange for cheap loans. This reform assessment, called the first review, stalled in February over details of the politically very difficult pension reform and because of diverging views between the euro zone and the IMF on how to make the economy and debt sustainable in the longer term. European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told reporters before the ministerial meeting he expected the ministers to decide on Monday to send the reform review team back to Greece. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he would support sending the team already this week. Two euro zone officials, who asked not to be named, said the lenders\u2019 representatives may set out already on Tuesday. \u201cThe lenders mission will return to Athens on Tuesday,\u201d a Greek government official said. Confirmation from Germany that Greece\u2019s creditors could return to Athens this week: Brent crude has hit $40 a barrel for the first time since early December. The move comes on hopes of continuing economic recovery in China, which set a target of 6.5% to 7% growth this year, which has boosted commodity prices generally. On top of that US data from information firm Genscape showed a lower than expected increase in stocks at the Cushing delivery hub in Oklahoma, at the same time as hopes are growing that producers could act to tackle the problem of oversupply. Back with Greece and reports are coming in that the country\u2019s international creditors will return to Athens on Tuesday, according to a Greek government official. And Reuters is quoting a eurozone official saying that ministers were told to prepare for the start of talks on debt relief for Greece in April. Meanwhile US markets have continued the downward trend being seen elsewhere. After last week\u2019s rally investors have decided to cash in some of their gains ahead of the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, when further interest rate cuts or other stimulus measures are expected. There is scope for disappointment here, however, as ECB president Mario Draghi tries to live up to his promises of taking all necessary action. The earlier gloomy report from the Bank of International Settlements, warning of a \u201cgathering storm\u201d for the global economy, is not helping sentiment. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slipped 33 points or 0.19, while at the open the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.45% and Nasdaq 0.56% lower. Greece\u2019s finance minister has urged its creditors to return to Athens and finish signing off its bailout review. Euclid Tsakalotos told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that the two sides can\u2019t simply keep arguing over pension reforms forever. He wants the institutions to accept Greece\u2019s position, opening the door for talks on debt relief. Tsakalotos said: \u201cThis question of time is important if we want to move from a vicious to a virtuous circle. We can\u2019t continue debating over pension reforms forever, as if to keep a wound open.....Pensions are part of the social safety net.\u201d More here: Greece urges completion of reform review by May 1 Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the eurogroup, has warned Greece that it must stick to its bailout deal. Arriving at today\u2019s eurogroup meeting in Brussels, Dijsselbloem said ministers would listen to \u201cthe institutions\u201d - Greece\u2019s lenders - and see how all sides can move forward.. But he insists that Greece cannot wriggle out of making the pension reforms demanded by creditors, saying: We need credible and sustainable pension reforms and the budget needs to be on track for the medium-term. This is not just something that concerns the IMF, it is something that concerns all the institutions and the eurogroup. We need to stick to the agreement that we had this summer. Dijsselbloem adds that he hopes to hear more details today about how pension reforms will work out. Those reforms are hugely unpopular in Greece, where farmers have been holding protests against pension cuts for months. Pierre Moscovici, EC commissioner for economic affair, is also speaking to the press. He hopes that the eurogroup will take a \u2018unanimous decision\u2019 that the mission chiefs representing Greece\u2019s creditors should return to Athens ASAP to conclude the current bailout review (which has been bogged down for months). Oil is also rising today, with Brent crude gaining over 1% to $39.50. Shares in Brazil mining group Vale have leapt by 8%, following the massive rally in iron ore this morning. Eurozone finance ministers should be arriving at EU headquarters shortly, for a regular eurogroup meeting. They\u2019ll be playing second-fiddle to the big EU Migration Summit, where leaders are wrangling over the refugee crisis. But the meeting could still be significant, given the deadlock between Greece and its lenders over the implementation of its bailout programme. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. Again. Eurogroup ministers are planning to look at what needs to be done to allow the first review of the bailout to be successfully completed (after many delays). And that list includes some serious challenges, including: ...reforming the pension system, fiscal strategy, making the privatisation fund operational and addressing the issue of non-performing loans, among other issues. The lack of progress is fuelling concerns over Greece\u2019s position in the eurozone, particularly as the refugee crisis is putting further pressure on its economy, and fuelling EU tensions. Former finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis has told our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith, that the situation is boiling up again: \u201cI think the situation right now is more dangerous than it was last summer [when Greece agreed its third bailout]. \u201cThen it was a question of the political will of a few people. Now it\u2019s a question of implementing reforms and working hard and if a government doesn\u2019t believe in them and implements them begrudgingly, progress becomes very difficult.\u201d It\u2019s not been a great few months for Goldman Sachs, and clients who followed its \u2018top tips for 2016\u2019. The Wall Street bank just closed all six trades, with five making losses. The failed bets included: Buying the dollar against the yen and the euro Buying yields on Italian bonds versus German ones Wagering that large US banks would outperform the general markek And betting that US inflation expectations would rise They were based on the idea that the US economy would strengthen this year, allowing the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates and pushing up the dollar. Unfortunately (for Goldman), the panic that gripped investors in January and February meant the markets moved against them. This chart of daily price moves confirms that today\u2019s 20% surge in iron ore is way, way, outside the norm: Commodity prices took a fierce battering in 2015, so investors may now be scrambling to get on the \u2018right side\u2019 of a rebound. Especially if fears of a global recession are fading. Rating agency Fitch has slashed its growth forecasts but predicted the world will avoid another full-blown recession. It now expects the world economy to expand by just 2.5% this year, not the 2.9% expected three months ago. That would only equal 2015\u2019s growth rate. Fitch expects advanced economies to expand by only 1.7%, down from 2.1% in December. For emerging markets, 2016 growth is now pegged at 4.0%, down from 4.4%. Encouragingly, Fitch believes we will avoid a severe downturn. Here\u2019s why: \u201cWith emerging markets at the epicentre of these shocks and now accounting for 40% of world GDP it is legitimate to ask whether the world will see, for more or less the first time in recent history, an emerging market led global recession. However, we believe several factors mitigate this risk. Firstly, labour market conditions in many of the major advanced economies look quite robust. Along with the benefits of lower oil prices on real incomes, this should help support consumer spending in rich countries and cushion the shock. Advanced economies look to be beyond the worst of the private sector deleveraging forces that held back domestic demand growth in the years following the global financial crisis. Furthermore, the impact of fiscal policy on growth in the advanced economies is currently less restrictive than it has been in the last few years. The iron ore price is on an absolute tear this morning, surging by almost 20%. The cause of the mega-rally isn\u2019t quite clear, but it follows speculation that the commodity crunch has bottomed out. China\u2019s latest government targets could also be driving demand. Over the weekend, Beijing committed to a target growth rate of 6.5% to 7% this year, and a budget deficit of 3% of GDP. Some traders think this equals another dose of fiscal stimulus, pushing demand for commodities up. Europe\u2019s major stock markets continue to lose ground this morning. BIS\u2019s warning of troubles ahead, the weak German factory orders data, and the drop in investor confidence reported by Sentix may all be weighing on sentiment on an otherwise quiet day. In London, the FTSE 100 has now shed 55 points. Miners are the big fallers, reversing some of their recent strong rally. Anglo American has shed 4%. Investors are already fretting about Thursday, when the European Central Bank holds its next monetary policy meeting. Everyone expects the ECB to announce something new on the stimulus front. But some fear a repeat of December\u2019s meeting, when market expectations weren\u2019t fully met. Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: After a tentative start the bears took hold this Monday, the European indices all sliding into the red with last week\u2019s confidence replaced by pre-ECB nerves. It\u2019s unclear what has inspired this shift in sentiment; general fears over the myriad of macro-maladies currently circling the markets appears to be the driving force this Monday, with this morning\u2019s warning from the BIS and the looming ECB meeting on Thursday only exacerbating matters. There is a chance this kind of jittery trading will continue until Mario Draghi puts the market out of its misery and reveals, for better or for worse, what \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 actually means this time around. Eurozone investor confidence has fallen to its lowest level in almost a year. Sentix, the German research group, reports that fears over the global economy hit morale among eurozone analysts and investors this month. Its economic index fell to 5.5, from 6.0 last month, which is the lowest since April 2015. Patrick Hussy, Sentix\u2019s managing director, says the Eurozone is suffering from \u201cthe loss of economic momentum of the global economy\u201d. Hussy\u2019s believes it should spur the European Central Bank into agreeing new stimulus measures at Thursday\u2019s meeting. Investors\u2019 perspective on the current situation in the Eurozone should resupply dovish members of the ECB council with enough ammunition to demand significantly more expansive monetary stimulus on Thursday\u2019s ECB meeting. Sentix\u2019s \u2018current conditions\u2019 sub-index fell from 10.5 to 8.3, suggesting the eurozone economy has suffered from the market turbulence and gloom in early 2016 But more encouragingly, the \u2018future expectations\u2019 measure rose to 2.8, from the 1.5 it slumped to in February. That may mean that confidence will rise again soon. Hussy says: \u201cInvestors\u2019 expectations are slowly turning against the negative trend.\u201d The CEO of France\u2019s EDF has pledged to take a \u2018final decision\u2019 soon on the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactor, following the shock resignation of his finance chief: Dirk Schlotboeller, economist at Germany\u2019s DIHK Chambers of Commerce. argues that German factories were lucky to only suffer a 0.1% drop in orders in January. Schlotboeller says: \u201cThis could have been worse in light of the bad news and turbulence on stock markets at the beginning of the year.\u201d Germany\u2019s finance ministry has warned that storm clouds are gathering over its manufacturing sector. Following the 1.6% drop in domestic factory orders in January, it says: \u201cOver the two months, the impulses are from abroad. \u201cHowever, expectations in industry have become considerably overcast and signal only a modest economic upswing.\u201d Shares in French energy company EDF slumped by almost 10% at the start of trading, following the shock resignation of its finance director. Thomas Piquemal quit after opposing the firm\u2019s plan to build a new \u00a318bn nuclear power station for the UK at Hinkley Point. Energy editor Terry Macalister explain: A new plant at Hinkley, in Somerset, is desperately needed and has been heavily promoted by the chancellor, George Osborne, and other ministers as a key part of keeping the lights on in Britain. But EDF has been hit by a series of problems that have led many \u2013 even in the City of London \u2013 to conclude that the new nuclear plant project is on the verge of collapse. Piquemal is said to have been arguing that pursuing what would be the world\u2019s most expensive power project at this moment could jeopardise the French group, which already has rising debts. More here: Germany\u2019s stock market has slipped a little in early trading following the factory orders report. The DAX fell almost 0.5%, with investors also digesting BIS\u2019s warning of global turmoil ahead. Germany has got the new week off to a poor start, by reporting that factory orders dipped last month. Industrial orders at the eurozone powerhouse economy fell by 0.1% month-on-month, adding to a 0.2% slide in December (revised up from -0.7%). Significantly, the fall was partly due to weaker demand from within Germany - suggesting that its economic growth may be stumbling. The Economy Ministry reports that domestic orders fell by 1.6% during the month, quite a hefty drop. And Germany manufacturers were also heavily reliant on other members of the single currency for export sales, as it felt the impact of slowing emerging markets. Sales to other eurozone members leapt by 7.5%, while exports to non-eurozone countries slid by 2.7%. That meant that overall export orders rose by 1%. Reaction to follow... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The new week begins with a serious warning from the Bank for International Settlements that the global markets could be heading into new turbulence. In its latest quarterly report, BIS has warned that that global credit boom could be on the point of unraveling. The \u201cuneasy calm\u201d that has settled on the markets in recent weeks could be about to burst. BIS, known as the central bankers\u2019 central bank, is worried that policymakers are now short of ammunition, at a time when the global economy looks fragile. It reckons that the credit cycle could have reached a turning point, with as the amount of debt being issued by emerging economies stalled in the last quarter. Claudio Borio, BIS\u2019s chief economist, warns: \u201cWe may not be seeing isolated bolts from the blue, but the signs of a gathering storm that has been building for a long time.\u201d BIS has been waving a red flag for years, saying the global economy has been piling up too much debt, rather than tackling the underlying problems of weak productivity and unreformed economic systems. BIS also fired a warning shot towards negative interest rates. It fears that the new fashion will backfire - potentially making commercial banks unprofitable,. It cautioned: \u201cThe viability of banks\u2019 business model as financial intermediaries may be brought into question.\u201d A timely warning, as the European Central Bank could impose deeper negative interest rates at Thursday\u2019s monetary policy committee meeting. The report is online here. And here\u2019s our full story on BIS\u2019s concerns: Also coming up today: Eurozone finance ministers will be holding a regular eurogroup meeting in Brussels this afternoon. They\u2019ll be considering Greece\u2019s bailout, and the deadlock between Athens and its creditors. There\u2019s not much in the economic calendar, but we do get the latest Sentix investor confidence report at 9.30am GMT.",

      "bodyText": "More than a third of an \u00a38.4m loan taken out of BHS by its new owners in March last year went to four directors who were part of the consortium, handing them a multimillion-pound windfall just days after buying the struggling department store chain. The Guardian understands that \u00a33m was shared between four directors of Retail Acquisitions Limited \u2013 Dominic Chappell, the man who led the buyout of BHS, Eddie Parladorio, Mark Tasker and Stephen Bourne, who has since resigned. Chappell is thought to have received the largest portion of the funds. Retail Acquisitions took the loan out of BHS days after buying the business for \u00a31 from Sir Philip Green. It has said the loan was for professional and financing fees. The payment to the directors is likely to anger landlords who are being asked to accept significant cuts to their rent by BHS, as well as hundreds of staff who could lose their jobs in the retailer\u2019s head office and shops. Retail Acquisitions is a consortium of little-known financiers, lawyers and accountants. Chappell has been declared bankrupt twice. The loan was paid out to Retail Acquisitions before the new leadership team of BHS was formed. That team, led by Darren Topp, the chief executive, is trying to turn the company around through a company voluntary arrangement and a restructuring of its pension fund. The pension fund had a deficit of \u00a3207m at the time of the last published accounts, although a triennial valuation scheduled to be completed by the end of June is expected to show it is now significantly more than this. BHS is in discussions about it entering the Pension Protection Fund, a lifeboat for schemes connected to struggling businesses. As part of the restructuring, Green, the former owner of BHS, could pay \u00a380m into the scheme. This would include \u00a340m in cash and \u00a340m as a loan from his retail business Arcadia, secured against assets. BHS\u2019s pension fund has more than 20,000 members, with the retailer employing more than 10,000 people. At the same time as trying to restructure its pension scheme, BHS wants to cut the rent on half of its 164 shops through an insolvency procedure. A CVA allows a company in financial difficulty to reach a deal with creditors, including landlords, to reduce its liabilities while still trading. They are legal but controversial in the property industry because they allow a company to walk away from its lease obligations. BHS has split its properties into three categories in the CVA: 77 stores that are unaffected; 47 stores that it claims are viable but need a reduction in rent to \u201cmarket levels\u201d; and 40 that need a substantial reduction in rent to survive. The rent reductions it has proposed are significant. Of the 47 \u201cviable\u201d shops, BHS wants the rent to be cut by 75% on 21 stores and 50% on 26 stores. For the struggling 40 shops it wants to pay just 25% of the rent for the next 10 months while it tries to reach a long-term deal that secures their survival. The agreement must be approved by 75% of BHS\u2019s creditors at a meeting scheduled for 23 March. BHS\u2019s demands on the 40 struggling sites are so significant that the survival of all its stores is unlikely. Savills, the property agent, has been brought in to assist tax experts KPMG and could dispose of unwanted stores. If stores close it could lead to the loss of thousands of jobs. BHS has already announced that 370 jobs will be lost as part of an overhaul of its head office and store management structure. BHS told staff on Friday that it intends to make 220 people redundant in stores and a further 150 in head office. In addition, BHS will scrap another 100 roles that had not been filled in its head office in recent months, meaning its central operations will shrink by roughly by a third. The restructuring has been dubbed internally as Project Pipe by KPMG and BHS. Documents relating to it include draft accounts for BHS up to 24 February this year, which show the loan between the retailer and Retail Acquisitions. Retail Acquisitions said: \u201cAs a matter of policy, and commercial obligations, we do not disclose information relating to professional fees and financial transaction costs.\u201d BHS said: \u201cIt is a question for [Retail Acquisitions Ltd] not BHS.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "A complex tax avoidance scheme being used by transport group Stagecoach to wipe \u00a311m off its tax bill has been defeated in the tax courts. In a 56-page ruling, a judge, Gordon Reid QC, found that the scheme, devised with the help of tax experts at KPMG, fell foul of tax avoidance legislation. The scheme involved shifting money between companies within the Stagecoach group to create a large loss in one of them without a corresponding gain in any other. Treasury minister David Gauke said: \u201cThis is a significant victory and should serve as a warning to those tempted by tax avoidance \u2013 it simply does not work.\u201d Jim Harra, director general of business tax at HM Revenue &amp; Customs, said: \u201cThis was clear tax avoidance. It was an attempt to manufacture losses to deny the public purse the tax due.\u201d A spokesman for Stagecoach said: \u201cWe believe it is right that we pay our fair share of taxes and we are committed to doing so. The case involved the interpretation of historical and technical issues which are no longer relevant under current legislation, and no additional tax is payable by Stagecoach as a result of the ruling. \u201cThese historic[al] transactions involved Stagecoach investment in its subsidiaries, and the first-tier tribunal ruling did not challenge the commercial background behind those transactions.\u201d The company said it had not ruled out an appeal, and added it would \u201ctake time to consider the findings ... before deciding on the way forward\u201d. Stagecoach, which had sales of \u00a33.2bn last year, employes 34,000 staff in the UK in its extensive bus and rail franchises. It also holds a 49% stake in Virgin Rail Group. It paid \u00a325.7m in tax for 2015 on profits of \u00a3165m. The failed tax avoidance scheme, however, related to 2011. HMRC said there were 11 similar disputes with other companies that would be affected by Monday\u2019s ruling. The total tax at stake from these cases is \u00a3179m. Tax inspectors have already secured \u00a3485m in tax and interest from 16 other groups which used similar schemes to try to avoid tax. KPMG had negotiated a \u201csuccess fee\u201d for its work on Stagecoach\u2019s tax structure. After the scheme was challenged by HMRC, solicitors from KPMG were appointed to act for Stagecoach in the court dispute. The close involvement of KPMG in the dispute comes despite the accountancy firm publishing a code of conduct on tax advice three years ago. That code said: \u201cWe will not advise clients to enter into transactions with the main purpose of securing a tax advantage clearly contrary to the intention of parliament in enacting the relevant legislation.\u201d It added: \u201cWe do not act as mere advocates of tax planning structures or arrangements. We shall only promote transactions or structures that have both substance and business purpose.\u201d On Monday, KPMG declined to answer questions about the Stagecoach tax scheme. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe are unable to comment on specific client situations, particularly where they are the subject of litigation.\u201d Stagecoach is a stock-market-listed company but its largest shareholders are its founders, Ann Gloag and her brother, Sir Brian Souter, who remains chairman of the business. Together the siblings control 26% of shares. Souter is a major donor to the Scottish National party. He donated \u00a31m in 2014 before Scotland\u2019s independence referendum. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has been among the most outspoken opponents of corporate tax avoidance. A year ago, the SNP leader said \u201ca whole political establishment\u201d had negligently allowed tax avoidance to become routine. In January, the party\u2019s deputy leader, Stewart Hosie, wrote to the European commission lodging a complaint against HMRC\u2019s controversial \u00a3130m tax settlement with Google. In 2000, Souter helped finance a campaign opposed to the abolition of a controversial law that restricted how sexuality was taught in schools. The law, known as clause 28, banned the \u201cpromotion of homosexuality\u201d and the teaching of the \u201cacceptability of homosexuality\u201d. It was repealed in Scotland in June 2000 and in England and Wales in November 2003.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Regulators have warned banks they could cap charges they levy on customers who dip into an unauthorised overdraft. The warning from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) came as it extended its investigation into the retail and small business banking sectors. The inquiry was due to end in May but has now been pushed back to 12 August, after the publication in October of a provisional report that was criticised as an inadequate response to the dominance of the so-called big four. Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC have a 70% share of current accounts. Their dominance has not been cracked by challenger banks, which have taken only a 5% market share in 10 years. As the CMA announced the three-month extension, it highlighted possible additional measures to make overdrafts fairer for customers. \u201cThese include measures to help customers better understand and manage their use of overdrafts, requiring banks to offer grace periods during which customers can take action to avoid unarranged overdraft charges, requiring banks to give PCA [personal current account] customers a choice on whether to have an unarranged overdraft facility or not, and measures to limit maximum unarranged overdraft charges each month,\u201d the CMA said. It said it needed the extra time after taking into consideration \u201cthe further work required to develop the analyses, and the further work required to develop a suitable package of remedies that is reasonable and comprehensive in addressing any findings of adverse effects on competition in the retail banking markets for PCA customers and SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises]\u201d. This was not enough to placate Which?, the consumer group that has been calling for radical changes to the sector. Its chief executive, Richard Lloyd, said: \u201cThis inquiry is now looking like a lost opportunity to deliver better banking for consumers.\u201d Comparing accounts offered by different current account providers is notoriously difficult because of the complex charges linked to overdrafts and other facilities. The CMA has been looking at ways for a price comparison service to be set up for small business customers. It said it favoured a move by Nesta, a charity backed by the National Lottery, to set up a fund to encourage the creation of a price comparison service for small businesses. The investigation was announced in July 2014 at a time of heightened political scrutiny of the sector and when the Labour party was calling for two new challenger banks to be set up.",

Their dominance has not been cracked by challenger banks, which have taken only a 5% market share in 10 years.</p> <p>As the CMA announced the three-month extension, it highlighted possible additional measures to make overdrafts fairer for customers. </p> <p>\u201cThese include measures to help customers better understand and manage their use of overdrafts, requiring banks to offer grace periods during which customers can take action to avoid unarranged overdraft charges, requiring banks to give PCA [personal current account] customers a choice on whether to have an unarranged overdraft facility or not, and measures to limit maximum unarranged overdraft charges each month,\u201d <a href=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/56dd7b6040f0b6037900000e/Updates_on_the_retail_banking_investigation_-_March_2016.p\">the CMA said</a>. </p> <p>It said it needed the extra time after taking into consideration \u201cthe further work required to develop the analyses, and the further work required to develop a suitable package of remedies that is reasonable and comprehensive in addressing any findings of adverse effects on competition in the retail banking markets for PCA customers and SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises]\u201d.</p> <p>This was not enough to placate Which?, the consumer group that has been calling for radical changes to the sector. Its chief executive, Richard Lloyd, said: \u201cThis inquiry is now looking like a lost opportunity to deliver better banking for consumers.\u201d</p> <p>Comparing accounts offered by different current account providers is notoriously difficult because of the complex charges linked to overdrafts and other facilities.

Lindsay Robinson was shopping at the Trafford Centre branch in Dumplington when her 16-month-old daughter, Heidi, had a crying fit. As Robinson was trying to calm her child, a member of staff from the menswear department approached and made the pair leave the shop. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve had a complaint, you will have to leave,\u2019\u201d Robinson, 36, said. \u201cI was shocked. I dropped a keyring and rucksack for Heidi that I was about to buy, and this staff member escorted us out of the store. \u201cHeidi has only just learned to walk, so I use a harness for her as she is a bit unsteady on her feet. I was carrying her and she started to lose the plot. I was trying to put the harness back on and Heidi was loud and vocal. I was trying to do my best to calm her down, and get her harness on so she didn\u2019t crawl off \u2026 Then I was asked to leave. I felt quite upset.\u201d Robinson, of Prestwich, made a formal complaint to John Lewis, which has apologised but confirmed that staff had asked her to move. Robinson said: \u201cI called customer services and someone did call me back. They apologised and said the member of staff\u2019s behaviour was out of order. They said they would send a \u00a320 voucher as an apology. I don\u2019t think I will be going back to that store. \u201cI am not interested in any voucher or money. My point is that when shops see a mother trying to deal with a child having a tantrum they should cut them a bit of slack. I was made to feel like a rubbish mum.\u201d She said the incident was embarrassing: \u201cEveryone was looking at me. It is a shame because I am a loyal customer. When I got married we had a wedding list of presents from there.\u201d The incident happened at 12pm on Saturday when the store was packed with people shopping for Mother\u2019s Day gifts. Robinson said she wanted a personal apology from the member of staff responsible. John Lewis said: \u201cWe are very sorry that Mrs Robinson was upset after visiting our shop. One of our managers spoke to her on Saturday to sincerely apologise and today our head of branch has written to Mrs Robinson to formally apologise again, and has also sent her flowers. \u201cAlthough our partner didn\u2019t escort Mrs Robinson out of the shop, he did ask her to leave in response to other customers\u2019 complaints. We\u2019re speaking to the partner about what happened, and how we could have been more sympathetic to Mrs Robinson and her daughter.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Brent crude oil has climbed back above $40 a barrel, as the recovery in commodity prices continued with iron ore posting a record rise of nearly 20%. Commodities prices have jumped in the last month on expectations that Beijing will work more aggressively to boost growth after two years of faltering manufacturing output. Prices for base metals, food and oil have all recovered from lows seen after the new year. Brent crude rose above $40 (\u00a328) a barrel on Monday as the oil price continues to recover after falling below $28 a barrel in January. Iron ore prices have posted a record rise of nearly 20% after China said it plans to boost growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy with higher deficit spending. The one-day increase of 19%, the highest since 2009, came after the Chinese finance minister, Lou Jiwei, said the government could manage a rising debt load as it stepped up deficit spending to prevent a slide in growth. \u201cWe are increasing the debt-to-GDP ratio to support achieving a medium- to high-speed rate of economic growth,\u201d said Lou. \u201cWhy do we do that? Because we don\u2019t want to see a decrease in economic growth and because we want to give strong support to structural reform.\u201d The US is the world\u2019s largest producer of iron ore, followed by Australia, Brazil and Canada. China is the world\u2019s largest user. Metal Bulletin data showed ore with 62% iron content delivered to the port of Qingdao jumped 19% to $63.74 a dry metric tonne, pushing the price back to the highest price since last June. A broader measure of iron ore saw the price reach $52.40 a tonne, up 40% since December\u2019s low of $37. But Goldman Sachs said the rally in iron ore prices would not last in the absence of a significant improvement in steel demand from China. The investment bank, which stuck to its bearish forecast, said not enough had changed in the market since the collapse in iron ore prices following a global glut and weaker Chinese steel demand. \u201cWe expect the current rally to be short-lived in the absence of a material increase in Chinese steel demand, and steel raw materials will once again drive steel prices rather than the other way around,\u201d Goldman said in a report. Goldman has kept its iron ore price forecast for 2016 at $38 a tonne and $35 for the next two years. The analysts, who predict Chinese steel production declining this year, said the bullish sentiment in China\u2019s steel market was not supported by hard data. \u201cWe are yet to find evidence of higher-than-expected steel demand \u2013 whether in the order books of individual steel producers or in the official data for new orders,\u201d they said. \u201cBased on the information currently available, the seasonal increase in demand appears only marginally stronger than last year.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "EDF unions call for Hinkley Point project to be postponed", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Union leaders at the French energy company EDF have called for investment in Britain\u2019s Hinkley Point nuclear power plant to be delayed for at least two years, warning that it represents a threat to the company\u2019s future. Workers\u2019 representatives say the sudden resignation of EDF finance director Thomas Piquemal has revealed that doubts over the feasibility of the controversial project go right to the top. \u201cThe resignation of such a high-ranking executive is pretty spectacular and shows the disagreement even at the highest levels,\u201d Serge Gianorsi, trade union secretary for the Force Ouvri\u00e8re union at EDF, told the Guardian. \u201cUntil now, managers have not expressed themselves publicly, but we have known for a long time that our position is shared by the majority of specialists inside and outside the company.\u201d The union leader\u2019s warning was backed up by Martin Young, an analyst with the investment bank RBC Capital Markets, who said proceeding with the Hinkley project would verge on \u201cinsanity\u201d. \u201cThe European electricity industry faces unprecedented challenges and change. EDF is not immune from these challenges, and we believe needs to act to a greater degree than has been proposed. Against that backdrop, to proceed with Hinkley Point C at this juncture would be verging on insanity. M Piquemal\u2019s resignation arguably suggests exactly that,\u201d wrote Young in a briefing on the company. Gianorsi is the latest union leader to express deep misgivings about the Hinkley Point project, and to question the French government\u2019s insistence that it go ahead. He added that if the French state, which owns roughly 85% of EDF, did not step back from the deal \u201cthere will be very heavy consequences for the future of the company and staff\u201d. In January, EDF announced it was laying off 4,000 workers over the next two years. Last summer, the French government and EDF were forced to step in with a multibillion-euro package to rescue Areva, France\u2019s designer and builder of nuclear reactors that had been hit by competition from foreign rivals and a plunge in demand for nuclear reactors following the Fukushima disaster. Marie-Claire Cailletaud, of the powerful CGT Energie union at EDF, agreed the UK project must be delayed. \u201cWe have already said it is urgent that this project be postponed because we feel the current state of EDF\u2019s nuclear branch and the company\u2019s financial situation make it dangerous to launch this right now,\u201d Cailletaud told Europe 1 radio. \u201cWe know this view is shared at the top level of the company but that people don\u2019t feel free to express themselves. So, I imagine this is a way for Mr Piquemal to show his disagreement.\u201d On Monday, EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said he wants to reach a final decision soon on investing in Britain\u2019s Hinkley Point nuclear power plant after Piquemal\u2019s resignation cast further doubt on the French energy company\u2019s ability to fund the \u00a318bn project. Levy said he regretted the \u201chastiness\u201d of Piquemal\u2019s departure. Piquemal resigned because he believed pursuing the world\u2019s most expensive nuclear project could threaten the group, whose finances are already stretched by rising debt. The finance chief\u2019s departure increased the feeling of crisis surrounding the Hinkley project, which is seen as vital for Britain to keep the lights on. If the plan were to collapse, it would be a serious blow to the UK government, which has offered generous guarantees to build two reactors at the site in Somerset. When asked if she could guarantee that there would be no additional costs for UK taxpayers, David Cameron\u2019s official spokesperson pointed to the discussions that were under way with the French government. \u201cI am not going to speculate about the resignation of one individual, that is a matter for EDF,\u201d she said, and insisted that it was clear from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande at the UK-France summit in Amiens last week that it had \u201cthe full support of the French government\u201d. EDF\u2019s battered share price fell 6.5% on Monday after Piquemal\u2019s resignation was revealed over the weekend. The company\u2019s shares have more than halved from \u20ac22 to \u20ac10 in the past year as concerns have mounted about its finances. In a deal supported strongly by the chancellor, George Osborne, EDF joined forces with the Chinese utility CGN in October to construct the reactors. But many industry figures now believe the project is on the verge of collapse. EDF said in October it expected to take a final decision and start deploying engineers at Hinkley Point in November. But the company has still not signed a final contract as fears have mounted about its financial strength. In an emailed statement, Levy said: \u201cWith the support of its state shareholder, EDF confirms it is studying the investment in the two Hinkley Point reactors in the best financial conditions for the group, with the aim of announcing a final investment decision soon,\u201d Reuters reported. On top of its large debts, EDF is grappling with a collapse in power prices, cost overruns on a nuclear project in France and upgrades costing tens of billions of euros on its domestic reactors. Piquemal\u2019s resignation raises grave doubts about EDF\u2019s ability to carry out the project, which the UK government is relying on to meet the country\u2019s energy needs. Levy said last month a decision on Hinkley Point was \u201ccoming closer\u201d as EDF reported a 68% plunge in annual profit and cut its dividend. The company said its net debt had increased by \u20ac3.2bn (\u00a32.5bn) to \u20ac37.4bn. EDF union leaders say the state and company should wait until France\u2019s first European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) go online at Flamanville around 2018 \u2013 six years late \u2013 to evaluate their safety and efficiency before agreeing to build them in Britain. \u201cIt will take at least two to three years to see how they work and to evaluate the technology and a minimum of security,\u201d Gianorsi said. \u201cWe consider that EDF is not in a position, financially or industrially, to launch the Hinkley Point project.\u201d",

EDF is not immune from these challenges, and we believe needs to act to a greater degree than has been proposed. Against that backdrop, to proceed with Hinkley Point C at this juncture would be verging on insanity. M Piquemal\u2019s resignation arguably suggests exactly that,\u201d wrote Young in a briefing on the company.</p> <p>Gianorsi is the latest union leader to express deep misgivings about the Hinkley Point project, and to question the French government\u2019s insistence that it go ahead.</p> <p>He added that if the French state, which owns roughly 85% of EDF, did not step back from the deal \u201cthere will be very heavy consequences for the future of the company and staff\u201d.</p> <p>In January, EDF announced it was laying off 4,000 workers over the next two years. Last summer, the French government and EDF were forced to step in with a multibillion-euro package to rescue Areva, France\u2019s designer and builder of nuclear reactors that had been hit by competition from foreign rivals and a plunge in demand for nuclear reactors following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fukushima\">Fukushima</a> disaster.<br></p> <p>Marie-Claire Cailletaud, of the powerful CGT Energie union at EDF, agreed the UK project must be delayed.</p> <p>\u201cWe have already said it is urgent that this project be postponed because we feel the current state of EDF\u2019s nuclear branch and the company\u2019s financial situation make it dangerous to launch this right now,\u201d Cailletaud told Europe 1 radio.</p> <p>\u201cWe know this view is shared at the top level of the company but that people don\u2019t feel free to express themselves. So, I imagine this is a way for Mr Piquemal to show his disagreement.\u201d<br></p> <p>On Monday, EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said he wants to reach a final decision soon on investing in Britain\u2019s Hinkley Point nuclear power plant after Piquemal\u2019s resignation cast further doubt on the French energy company\u2019s ability to fund the \u00a318bn project.</p> <p>Levy said he regretted the \u201chastiness\u201d of Piquemal\u2019s departure. Piquemal resigned because he believed pursuing the world\u2019s most expensive nuclear project could threaten the group, whose finances are already stretched by rising debt.</p> <p>The finance chief\u2019s departure increased the feeling of crisis surrounding the Hinkley project, which is seen as vital for Britain to keep the lights on. If the plan were to collapse, it would be a serious blow to the UK government, which has offered generous guarantees to build two reactors at the site in Somerset.<br></p> <p>When asked if she could guarantee that there would be no additional costs for UK taxpayers, David Cameron\u2019s official spokesperson pointed to the discussions that were under way with the French government.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to speculate about the resignation of one individual, that is a matter for EDF,\u201d she said, and insisted that it was clear from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande at the UK-France summit in Amiens last week that it had \u201cthe full support of the French government\u201d. </p> <p>EDF\u2019s battered share price fell 6.5% on Monday after Piquemal\u2019s resignation was revealed over the weekend.

In a statement on the one-year anniversary of a boardroom coup that ousted directors connected to the Sports Direct founder and Rangers shareholder, Mike Ashley, the chairman, Dave King, took aim at the club\u2019s joint venture partners and former creditors who attempted to have him jailed before Christmas. King said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that it required the repayment of the expensive so-called \u2018interest-free\u2019 loan [from Sports Direct] before we were able to give notice on the agreement with Sports Direct or to take legal action to protect the club\u2019s interests and seek restitution. \u201cThis bizarre state of affairs was caused by poorly negotiated agreements prior to regime change during which personal interest was put ahead of those of the club. Additionally, some of the individuals negotiating on behalf of Rangers had a clear conflict of interest.\u201d The comments mark the latest exchange between the two warring parties after Sports Direct backed down from its legal battle with the football club and abandoned legal efforts to prevent disclosure of the pair\u2019s joint venture last month. A high court judge, Mr Justice Peter Smith, called Sports Direct\u2019s court case a \u201cridiculous piece of litigation\u201d \u2013 a further blow to the the sportswear retailer that had previously failed to have King found guilty of contempt of court and sent to prison following allegations he had violated a gagging order. That interim order was imposed last summer, blocking Rangers from publicly revealing details of its agreement with the retailer, which contains swingeing clauses and was already subject to commercial confidentiality agreements. A Guardian analysis of the Rangers accounts last month suggested that the joint venture with Sports Direct, Rangers Retail Ltd, had paid the Scottish Championship team dividends of about \u00a3559,000 since the deal came into effect about four years ago. During that time, the Rangers store had taken more than \u00a313m through its tills from fans, while a previous retail deal with JJB Sports saw the club receive an initial payment of \u00a318m, with a guaranteed minimum annual royalty of \u00a33m. Over the same four-year period, the accounts also suggest that Sports Direct was paid three times Rangers\u2019 dividends, totalling about \u00a31.8m. On top of those payments, it has also earned hundreds of thousands of pounds from the joint venture for providing retailing services. Despite the difference in the amounts received by each party, Rangers owns 51% of Rangers Retail, while Sports Direct holds the remaining 49%. The agreements between the two also include: A seven-year notice period to break the contract A confidentiality agreement that binds Rangers but not Sports Direct Obligations for Rangers Retail to buy stock at a \u201chigher cost than its retail value\u201d A clause allowing Sports Direct to force Rangers out of its shareholding in Rangers Retail if the relationship between the club and the retailer is \u201cdeadlocked\u201d A further clause that forced the football club to pay Sports Direct \u00a3620,000 for closing down two former Rangers stores in Glasgow and Belfast Zero upfront payment to Rangers for awarding the retail deal to Sports Direct in 2012 A controlling vote for Sports Direct on \u201cfinancial matters\u201d concerning Rangers Retail.

      "bodyText": "British American Tobacco is bucking the downward market trend following weekend reports the company could be on the acquisition trail. Its shares are up 39p at 4083.5p in a FTSE 100 which is now down 50.41 points at 6149.02. The Sunday Telegraph reported that BAT has added Centerview Partners to its advisory team which led to speculation it could be contemplating a bid for the 58% of US group Reynolds America which it does not already own. But analyst Martin Deboo at Jefferies said BAT holds most of the cards in any industry consolidation and can afford to bide its time until exchange rates are more favourable. He said: We reflect on media speculation around a move by BATS for Reynolds. We keep any excitement firmly in check. We think BATS holds most of cards in any consolidation end-game and can afford to bide its time, pending a more favourable fx climate. But it all goes to show that BATS is a fabulously strategic asset, still trading on a compelling valuation despite a robust opening to 2016. Centerview is advisor of the moment, having advised on the recent ABI/SAB, Kraft/Heinz and Reynolds/Lorillard transactions. So it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that BAT might value its expertise. But we are inclined to keep our excitement in check on the imminence of any deal by BAT, for either Reynolds or indeed Imperial Brands. Reynolds ... isn\u2019t exactly cheap, trading on 22 times earnings. The back of our fag packet suggests that acquiring the remaining 58% of Reynolds at a 30% premium would cost BAT just over \u00a339bn. Including Reynolds\u2019 net debt, the cheque would be around \u00a347bn in toto... [Any deal] would probably require new equity.... We think BAT would want to think carefully about any dilutive raise.... Our principal caution around any big moves by BAT at this point in the cycle is that moving for any Developed Market assets like Reynolds or even Imperial means paying for predominantly $, \u00a3 and \u20ac earnings with Real, Rand and Rouble-denominated cashflows. Cashflows that have depreciated by over 30% in the past couple of years. Our near-term caution apart, it seems almost inevitable that there will be some sort of end-game consolidation in global tobacco over the next five years... We think BAT holds most of the cards in such an end-game, which is part of what makes it such a great (and cheap!) asset for us. Philip Morris can\u2019t lead global consolidation apart from recombining with Altria, which is arguably competition-neutral. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we think it is BAT, not Japan Tobacco, that holds the key to any consolidation of Imperial Brand. BAT\u2019s Reynolds stake blocks any move by Japan Tobacco for RAI. So BAT has multiple choices, and can afford to bide its time, suggesting that Centerview is only at the beginning of a beautiful relationship.",

      "body": "<p><strong>British American Tobacco</strong> is bucking the downward market trend following weekend reports the company could be on the acquisition trail.</p> <p>Its shares are up 39p at 4083.5p in a FTSE 100 which is now down 50.41 points at 6149.02. The Sunday Telegraph reported that BAT has added Centerview Partners to its advisory team which led to speculation it could be contemplating a bid for the 58% of US group Reynolds America which it does not already own.</p> <p>But analyst Martin Deboo at Jefferies said BAT holds most of the cards in any industry consolidation and can afford to bide its time until exchange rates are more favourable. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We reflect on media speculation around a move by BATS for Reynolds. We keep any excitement firmly in check. We think BATS holds most of cards in any consolidation end-game and can afford to bide its time, pending a more favourable fx climate. But it all goes to show that BATS is a fabulously strategic asset, still trading on a compelling valuation despite a robust opening to 2016. </p> <p>Centerview is advisor of the moment, having advised on the recent ABI/SAB, Kraft/Heinz and Reynolds/Lorillard transactions. So it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that BAT might value its expertise. But we are inclined to keep our excitement in check on the imminence of any deal by BAT, for either Reynolds or indeed Imperial Brands.</p> <p>Reynolds ... isn\u2019t exactly cheap, trading on 22 times earnings. The back of our fag packet suggests that acquiring the remaining 58% of Reynolds at a 30% premium would cost BAT just over \u00a339bn. Including Reynolds\u2019 net debt, the cheque would be around \u00a347bn in toto...</p> <p>[Any deal] would probably require new equity.... We think BAT would want to think carefully about any dilutive raise....</p> <p>Our principal caution around any big moves by BAT at this point in the cycle is that moving for any Developed Market assets like Reynolds or even Imperial means paying for predominantly $, \u00a3 and \u20ac earnings with Real, Rand and Rouble-denominated cashflows. Cashflows that have depreciated by over 30% in the past couple of years.</p> <p>Our near-term caution apart, it seems almost inevitable that there will be some sort of end-game consolidation in global tobacco over the next five years... We think BAT holds most of the cards in such an end-game, which is part of what makes it such a great (and cheap!) asset for us. Philip Morris can\u2019t lead global consolidation apart from recombining with Altria, which is arguably competition-neutral. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we think it is BAT, not Japan Tobacco, that holds the key to any consolidation of Imperial Brand. BAT\u2019s Reynolds stake blocks any move by Japan Tobacco for RAI. So BAT has multiple choices, and can afford to bide its time, suggesting that Centerview is only at the beginning of a beautiful relationship. </p> </blockquote>",

      "bodyText": "Building an \u00a318bn nuclear power station such as Hinkley Point C would be a huge financial commitment for any energy company \u2013 even one that is mainly state-owned. EDF, the company at the heart of the Somerset project that is 85% owned by the French government, has brought in Chinese state-owned firms as partners and negotiated generous subsidies with the UK government. However, the resignation of EDF\u2019s finance director, Thomas Piquemal, shows nervousness at the top of the group about the dangers of a project of this magnitude, even though chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy insisted on Monday that he still wanted to reach a final decision on the Hinkley investment soon. EDF is under tremendous pressurefrom inside the company to stop but also to proceed, with the British government desperate to avoid a flagship energy project being abandoned at a time when few other schemes seem to be going right. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, told UK PM David Cameron last week that he wanted to see Hinkley go ahead, but he has loaded EDF with added financial responsibilities at a time when it could least manage them. Hinkley Point in 2012 might have looked like just another ambitious but doable scheme. But the intervening years have brought trouble \u2013 a lot of it \u2013 to the French company. Flamanville EDF has been building a European pressurised reactor (EPR) plant in Normandy, France. The latest EPR has been dreamed up by EDF in conjunction with its engineering partner Areva. It was meant to be a showcase to the world, allowing EDF and Areva to market and build these plants globally, not least at Hinkley in Somerset. But Flamanville has turned into a nightmare project with endless delays, regulatory problems and cost overruns. The situation has been made worse by another scheme involving EPRs at Olkiluoto in Finland. This too has turned into a huge public relations embarrassment. It has been plagued with contract disputes, broken budgets and is 10 years behind schedule. Fukushima The Japanese nuclear disaster that occurred five years ago this Saturday has badly dented confidence in nuclear power, the technology that EDF specialises in. Germany has decided to abandon atomic power in the aftermath of Fukushima. France relies on it for almost all of its electricity and will continue to do so. But the Paris government has insisted EDF must introduce new safety mechanisms on its reactors in France. The cost of these changes have been estimated by some experts at up to \u20ac50bn (\u00a338.7bn). Energy prices The wholesale cost of electricity has been tumbling in Britain and the rest of Europe, making it harder for relatively higher-cost nuclear to compete. Some of this is temporary, due to falling oil and gas prices, and some is more permanent because of subsidised renewable power. Wind and solar technologies are developing fast and reducing in price, which puts more pressure on rival energy sources. EDF, which has already large debts, has already been forced to borrow money to pay for dividends to shareholders, notably the French government. The share price has been hammered by these financial stresses and is now almost 90% lower than it was in 2007. News of the finance director\u2019s resignation led EDF shares to plunge 10% in early trading on Monday. Even many financial analysts in the City of London have concluded that Hinkley would be a step too far. RBC Capital Markets said: \u201cTo proceed with Hinkley Point C at this juncture would be verging on insanity.\u201d EDF has in turn said it is willing to sell a bundle of \u20ac6bn worth of assets to raise cash in the meantime. Among the stakes that could be sold is a 30% holding in EDF Energy in Britain, the formal developer of Hinkley. It is not clear at this time who would want to buy these assets and what price they would pay. Areva A lot of EDF\u2019s problems have been caused by the near financial collapse at its nuclear engineering partner, Areva. This company designed the EPR and has been at the heart of the Olkiluoto plant delays. It is said to need a \u20ac7bn cash injection over the next couple of years to keep going. The French government has in effect demanded that EDF take over Areva \u2013 putting even more pressure on EDF\u2019s finances. Areva has designed the proposed new Hinkley reactors and was meant to be lined up to win some of the biggest contracts there much to the frustration of British engineering firms. Board warfare The financial pressures on EDF have led to the company announcing in January a 5% reduction to its workforce. The French unions, who have places on the group board, are furious and blame Hinkley for some of the problems. They want the Somerset project ditched to avoid further difficulties. They are accused by some nuclear industry experts of leaking negative information from board meetings to try to undermine the Hinkley plans further. The resignation of Piquemal, which apparently happened last week but was only confirmed on Monday, suggests even he believes Hinkley could break the EDF camel\u2019s back. For such a senior executive to walk out at such a crucial point puts enormous pressure on Levy not to proceed too quickly. Piquemal is believed to have wanted to delay the decision on Hinkley until new money was successfully raised from the proposed asset sales. Levy may yet get his way over the dissenters inside the board but the stakes are now very, very high.",

The investment group has jumped 14.6p or 8% to 194.3p following weekend reports it could be preparing a \u00a39bn break-up. Sky News said it was working on a plan to split into standalone companies comprising its stake in South Africa\u2019s Nedbank, its UK wealth business, its South African emerging markets division and its institutional asset management operations. Two private equity firms were already said to have tabled offers for Old Mutual Wealth. In response Old Mutual has said it was conducting a strategic review, and said all options were being considered. But no decision had yet been made. It will provide an update with Friday\u2019s figures. Analyst Eamonn Flanagan at Shore Capital said: Old Mutual Wealth has developed a vertically integrated model in the UK with the Skandia platform sitting alongside distributor Intrinsic and the asset management business OMGI, together with its in-house manufacturer. Total asset amounted to \u00a398.7bn at the end of November 2015 (current figure is likely to be lower) with 2015 operating profits expected to amount to around \u00a3265m. With a fair wind this business could be worth around 15 times 2015 full year earnings which would imply a figure of around \u00a33bn, equivalent to around 3% of funds. The group\u2019s current market capitalisation of \u00a38.9bn compares to our adjusted group value of around \u00a310bn, within which Old Mutual Wealth accounts for around \u00a32.0bn\u2026hence, a disposal/demerger at this value could add around \u00a31bn to this figure, equivalent to around 20p per share. We believe that such a disposal or demerger of Old Mutual Wealth is a distinct possibility. The interaction with the South African life and banking operations is pretty limited and, indeed, probably introduces the conglomerate discount that the stock has traded on for quite a while. In addition, we remind readers of the group\u2019s previous record of such radical moves, such as the sale of Skandia\u2019s Scandinavian business a few years ago, and the subsequent return of capital. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said: Investors will be hoping that it\u2019s a case of 2+2=5 with the individual assets of the company being worth more on a stand-alone basis than whilst held together. Some might argue the timing is rather fortuitous just days before results, getting the shares back to the 200p mark last traded in early December. It also closes the December gap down when South Africa-exposed stocks were hurt by the ousting of the country\u2019s finance minister, stoking scepticism among foreign investors. However, Barclays announcement that it is exiting Africa implies interest from suitors for operations in the geography and potential for transactions while suggestions are that the wealth division is being eyed by a pair of buyout firms. Meanwhile JP Morgan Cazenove has issued an underweight rating on equities after the recent rebound, but said the UK was still its top regional pick despite the worries about Brexit. Overall with mining shares lower, despite China saying over the weekend it expected growth of 6.5% to 7%, the FTSE 100 is down 34.15 points 6165.28.

      "bodyText": "Fastjet, the African budget airline backed by Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, said it may need to raise funds this year after low demand for flights forced it to issue a second profit warning in less than three months. The company\u2019s shares plunged more than 40% taking their fall in the past year to more than 70%. Difficult market conditions in the African airline industry have lasted longer than management expected, Fastjet said in a trading update. Results this year will be worse than expected and the company does not expect to generate any cash in 2016. Fastjet said it had more than $20m (\u00a314m) of cash available at the end of February and that it had enough to meet operational requirements. But the company said it might seek to raise further funds later in the year. In December, Fastjet blamed low demand for travel in its main market of Tanzania and weak African currencies for lower than expected revenues. But Haji-Ioannou, who helped set up the company and owns 12%, has criticised management for high spending that he says has burned through cash. Ed Winter, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in January he would step down when a replacement was found but Haji-Ioannou has called for him to leave immediately. In its trading statement, Fastjet said it had cut costs and was taking further action including reducing capacity. Haji-Ioannou, the easyJet tycoon, invested in Fastjet in 2012. The company\u2019s ambition was to carry more than 12 million passengers a year by cashing in on demand for regional travel from a fast-growing African middle-class. But it has taken longer than expected to set up hubs in countries such as Zambia and Zimbabwe. The company said: \u201cBased on current management forecasts, the board expects results for 2016 to be materially below market expectations and the group no longer expects to be cashflow positive for the year. \u201cThe board may consider raising further funds during the year to provide additional headroom and ensure the company has the necessary resources to fund future growth as market conditions improve.\u201d Fastjet shares fell as much as 44% to 36.5p.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The recent annual release of gender indicators by the ABS reveals that the median superannuation balance of women at retirement is just 53% that of men. It\u2019s a situation that shows some signs of change, but which will continue to exist so long as we have cultural expectations of women sacrificing their careers to care for children while men stay working full-time. Whenever I write about superannuation I often focus on women because my own working life is more typical of an Australian woman than a man. For a vast proportion of my adulthood I have been either working part-time, casual or on short-term contracts. Since I left university back in the early 1990s, I have worked in a full-time position for the equivalent of just seven and a half years. It is a curious state of affairs and one which has also meant that for most of the nearly 20 years I have been married, my wife has earned more than I have. And certainly in a cumulative sense her adult life earnings are well in excess of mine. I thought of this while looking at the latest package of annual gender indicators which was released last month by the ABS. The release noted that in 2013-14, the median superannuation balance of men at or near the preservation age was $150,000, compared to women with just $80,000: It\u2019s a disparity that has narrowed only slightly over the past decade. The median superannuation balances of men and women at various ages since 2003 does however suggest things may be improving. In 2003-04, the superannuation balance of women aged 15-24 was just 67% of men that same age. By 2013-14 little had changed, but there had been a large shift in the respective levels of for those aged 25-34: In 2003-04 women from their mid 20 to mid 30s had a superannuation balance of just 75% that of their male peers, by 2013-14 this was up to 90%. It\u2019s a significant increase and suggests that in time the flow through to the balance at the retirement age should be closer than it is currently. The figures also point to the broader reason of why women\u2019s retirement balance is so much less than men\u2019s. Historically women are more likely to reduce their work in the prime-working ages of their 20s and 30s. And they can never catch up. The reason of course is that women are the ones who give birth and need to take time off work. Fortunately we now have paid parental leave meaning that women no longer have to quit their occupation. But what is also clear from the gender indicators is that even in the years after the birth of a child, women are more likely than men to reduce their working hours to care for the child. The figures found (admittedly in 2006, they\u2019re starting to get a bit out of date) that regardless of employment situation women spend more time per day caring for a child: The figures accord with the findings of a recent study by the OECD that men account for just one in 50 parents in Australia taking advantage of parental leave. And from personal experience I can say that is a sad state of affairs. When our first child was born I was studying for my PhD and teaching at JCU in Cairns and although I did not have any parental leave as such, I was able to stay home two days a week and look after our daughter once my wife went back to full-time work. It was a glorious period of my life, one I know that is not possible for many men, but which is also not contemplated by many who could do it. I have recently been pondering my current \u201cflexible\u201d work \u2013 its value to me as a parent, and how it places me professionally. Much as I value it, I still have the occasional feeling that being a father who doesn\u2019t work full-time is somehow wrong \u2013 such that I will consider doing a job that would see me give up dropping and picking up my daughter from school each day. It also gives me some pause whenever I look over the horizon to my retirement. This feeling accorded with the findings of another survey, which I suspect explains as well part of the reason why so few men take advantage of parental leave and also why women are more likely to do the bulk of the child care. As recent study from Bain &amp; Company and Chief Executive Women found that was more injurious to men\u2019s careers than to women were they to work flexibly \u2013 either by working irregular hours, or going part-time or being able to work from home. Not only were men deemed to be less worthy for promotion if they pursued a flexible working arrangement, they were twice as more likely than women to have their request turned down. In effect the old view that women are the ones who take time off (and whose careers suffer) remains. But it is changing \u2013 partly because since 1990 part-time work has become more common, and partly because of changing attitudes and the availability of child care. Back in 1980 around 90% of men aged 25 to 50 worked full-time, whereas at best only 53% of women aged 20-24 worked full-time \u2013 and once over that age the numbers dropped dramatically. Those women then aged in their mid 20s are the ones whose median retirement income 35 years later is just 53% that of the same aged men. In 2015, fewer men work full-time \u2013 now the peak is around 80% - but while women overall are more likely to work full-time than in 1980 they still lag well behind men: The big change has been that married women aged 25-34 are much more likely to work full-time than in the past: And the ability to stay in work remains vital both to actual income earned and for career prospects. While the Bain study may suggest men are hurt more by working flexibly than women, I\u2019d suggest it is because women\u2019s career prospects are already devalued by many employers by the belief that they will at some point work flexibly. You don\u2019t just have to look at the pathetic numbers of women CEOs to see the inability for women to achieve leadership roles. Women, for example, account for nearly 75% of primary, middle and secondary school teachers, but just 49.9% of school principals. But even among teachers themselves, women are more likely to earn less \u2013 either due to working part-time or working in less senior positions. In 2012-13, 37% of men secondary school teachers earned between $80,000 and $180,000 compared to just 26% of women teachers: It\u2019s a situation that occurs across most occupations \u2013 even those which have higher numbers of women working than men, such as bank workers: Or solicitors: Or even my current profession of journalism: Women are more likely to be the ones staying home to care for children, women are the ones more likely to be working part-time, and men are deemed almost abnormal for seeking to do so. Women are thus the ones who across most occupations earn less \u2013 either because they have taken time off, or are perceived to be likely to do so and thus overlooked for promotion. And women are the ones who end up with lower superannuation balances upon retirement.",

For a vast proportion of my adulthood I have been either working part-time, casual or on short-term contracts. Since I left university back in the early 1990s, I have worked in a full-time position for the equivalent of just seven and a half years. </p> <p>It is a curious state of affairs and one which has also meant that for most of the nearly 20 years I have been married, my wife has earned more than I have. And certainly in a cumulative sense her adult life earnings are well in excess of mine. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/may/28/for-improving-bottom-inequality-the-budgets-childcare-spending-gets-a-tick\">Better equality in Australia is tainted by high jobless poverty rates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I thought of this while looking at the latest package of annual <a href=\"http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/ProductsbyReleaseDate/E88D96DAE5F55E7ACA2578FD0017FB2D?OpenDocument\">gender indicators</a> which was released last month by the ABS.</p> <p>The release noted that in 2013-14, the median superannuation balance of men at or near the preservation age was $150,000, compared to women with just $80,000:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Median superannuation balance for men &amp; women aged 55-64\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MlEcn/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a disparity that has narrowed only slightly over the past decade. </p> <p>The median superannuation balances of men and women at various ages since 2003 does however suggest things may be improving.</p> <p>In 2003-04, the superannuation balance of women aged 15-24 was just 67% of men that same age. By 2013-14 little had changed, but there had been a large shift in the respective levels of for those aged 25-34: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Women's median superannuation balance compared to men\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jneiA/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In 2003-04 women from their mid 20 to mid 30s had a superannuation balance of just 75% that of their male peers, by 2013-14 this was up to 90%.</p> <p>It\u2019s a significant increase and suggests that in time the flow through to the balance at the retirement age should be closer than it is currently. </p> <p>The figures also point to the broader reason of why women\u2019s retirement balance is so much less than men\u2019s. Historically women are more likely to reduce their work in the prime-working ages of their 20s and 30s. And they can never catch up. </p> <p>The reason of course is that women are the ones who give birth and need to take time off work. Fortunately we now have paid parental leave meaning that women no longer have to quit their occupation. But what is also clear from the gender indicators is that even in the years after the birth of a child, women are more likely than men to reduce their working hours to care for the child.</p> <p>The figures found (admittedly in 2006, they\u2019re starting to get a bit out of date) that regardless of employment situation women spend more time per day caring for a child: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Average hours spent per day caring for dependent children\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pjLSo/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The figures accord with the findings of a <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/gender/parental-leave-where-are-the-fathers.pdf\">recent study by the OECD</a> that men account for just one in 50 parents in Australia taking advantage of parental leave. </p> <p>And from personal experience I can say that is a sad state of affairs. </p> <p>When our first child was born I was studying for my PhD and teaching at JCU in Cairns and although I did not have any parental leave as such, I was able to stay home two days a week and look after our daughter once my wife went back to full-time work. </p> <p>It was a glorious period of my life, one I know that is not possible for many men, but which is also not contemplated by many who could do it. </p> <p>I have recently been pondering my current \u201cflexible\u201d work \u2013 its value to me as a parent, and how it places me professionally. Much as I value it, I still have the occasional feeling that being a father who doesn\u2019t work full-time is somehow wrong \u2013 such that I will consider doing a job that would see me give up dropping and picking up my daughter from school each day. </p> <p>It also gives me some pause whenever I look over the horizon to my retirement.</p> <p>This feeling accorded with the findings of another survey, which I suspect explains as well part of the reason why so few men take advantage of parental leave and also why women are more likely to do the bulk of the child care. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/03/flexible-working-helps-women-succeed-but-makes-men-unhappy-study-finds\">recent study</a> from <a href=\"http://www.cew.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/BAIN_CEW_REPORT_The_power_of_flexibility_Boosting_gender_parity-vF.pdf\">Bain &amp; Company and Chief Executive Women</a> found that was more injurious to men\u2019s careers than to women were they to work flexibly \u2013 either by working irregular hours, or going part-time or being able to work from home. </p> <p>Not only were men deemed to be less worthy for promotion if they pursued a flexible working arrangement, they were twice as more likely than women to have their request turned down. </p> <p>In effect the old view that women are the ones who take time off (and whose careers suffer) remains.</p> <p>But it is changing \u2013 partly because since 1990 part-time work has become more common, and partly because of changing attitudes and the availability of child care. </p> <p>Back in 1980 around 90% of men aged 25 to 50 worked full-time, whereas at best only 53% of women aged 20-24 worked full-time \u2013 and once over that age the numbers dropped dramatically. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of men and women in full-time work by age (1980)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/H4IbK/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Those women then aged in their mid 20s are the ones whose median retirement income 35 years later is just 53% that of the same aged men. </p> <p>In 2015, fewer men work full-time \u2013 now the peak is around 80% - but while women overall are more likely to work full-time than in 1980 they still lag well behind men:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of men and women in full-time work by age (2015)\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2YdJU/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The big change has been that married women aged 25-34 are much more likely to work full-time than in the past:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of men &amp; women aged 25-34, working full-time by marital status\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/W0Dkq/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And the ability to stay in work remains vital both to actual income earned and for career prospects.

The manufacturers\u2019 organisation EEF said there were signs of a \u201cbottoming out\u201d in some of the trends from last year, when output fell, steel plants closed and orders plummeted for those factories supplying the embattled oil industry. The latest poll of 369 companies found that manufacturing output continued to fall over the last quarter but had improved after hitting its weakest point in six years at the end of 2015. Manufacturers were also predicting output would grow again over the coming three months as order books improve. But they remained generally cautious after being buffeted by global factors including a commodity price rout, steel oversupply and China\u2019s economic downturn. \u201cAfter the gloomy end to 2015, this latest data shows a chink of light,\u201d said EEF chief economist Lee Hopley. \u201cBut, we should not be getting the deckchairs out yet. The slide is bottoming out, but manufacturing is still in negative territory and faces a precarious climb back up amidst a storm of real uncertainty.\u201d At the turn of the year, the EEF forecast that UK manufacturers would shed tens of thousands of jobs in 2016. Hopley said the gloomy outlook for employment had not changed. EEF forecasts the sector will shrink from 2.66 million employees last year to 2.63 million this year and 2.61 million by the end of 2017. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything in the survey that gives me lots of confidence about jobs. Sentiment could turn a corner in the next couple of months but that isn\u2019t translating into strong plans to take on more people or into big investment plans,\u201d said Hopley. Against the backdrop of weak demand and output, plans for capital spending were also subdued. \u201cFrom concerns about the growth outlook in emerging economies \u2013 especially China \u2013 to the, perhaps premature, decision by the US Fed to increase interest rates \u2013 manufacturers are still operating in a storm of global uncertainty,\u201d added Hopley. But she said there were no obvious signs yet that Britain\u2019s upcoming referendum on EU membership in June was a significant factor weighing on confidence or spending plans. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s \u2018and another thing\u2019, that\u2019s how it\u2019s coming through ... The interesting thing might be when we get our next survey results at the end of May.\u201d The business group has revised down its forecast for overall UK economic growth this year to 1.9%, from 2.1%. That is weaker than a forecast for 2.2% from the International Monetary Fund and 2.4% from the UK government\u2019s independent forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility. EEF expects the manufacturing sector, about a tenth of the whole economy, to grow 0.6%, lower than its previous forecast for 0.8%. The survey also highlights differences between sub-sectors of manufacturing. The outlook was tough for the steel sector and those manufacturers exposed to problems in the oil industry, which has been hurt by sharp falls in crude prices.

      "bodyText": "The City\u2019s top regulator has said a new system designed to hold bank executives to account is \u201cnot about trying to get heads on sticks\u201d. The new regulatory regime, which came into force on Monday and holds top executives responsible for failures in banks, has been watered down since it was first proposed, though Tracey McDermott, the acting head of the Financial Conduct Authority, insisted it would still have a major impact. She told the Guardian the new arrangements were \u201cnot about trying to get heads on sticks \u2013 this regime is about trying make sure that banks are run better\u201d. That will be achieved by bosses better understanding their responsibilities. McDermott has been accused of taking a less stringent approach to regulating banks since taking up the role in September, particularly after dropping a review into banking culture. She said: \u201cI completely reject any suggestion I or the organisation is going soft on banks or going soft on the City.\u201d The senior managers and certification regime comes into force alongside a new criminal offence of failing to prevent a bank from collapsing, in an attempt to address the fallout of the 2008 banking crisis where senior bankers were not found culpable. They were born out of ideas presented by the parliamentary commission on banking standards set up in the wake of the Libor rigging scandal in 2012. George Osborne said: \u201cThe new criminal offence, which becomes law today, is the latest milestone in my plan to ensure that the British banking industry operates to the highest possible standard. It is absolutely right that a senior manager whose actions causes their bank to fail should face jail.\u201d However, the chancellor, who has talked about having a \u201cnew settlement\u201d with the City following the crisis, diluted parts of the regime. In particular, he has changed his mind over the burden of proof required for a finding of wrongdoing by senior bankers. Initially, it had been envisaged that the new regime would require bankers to demonstrate they had done the right thing throughout any banking failure. But after intense lobbying the revised burden of proof will fall on the FCA, requiring the regulator to actively prove wrongdoing by bankers, who are presumed to have acted correctly. McDermott has not decided whether she will stay on once Andrew Bailey, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, arrives to run the FCA. She said she was told of the revisions in advance but not consulted on it and refused to say whether she would have argued against the decision, which was announced in October. The acting FCA boss had been in contention to lead the regulator on a permanent basis, but decided to withdraw from the race. Her decision was disclosed by George Osborne during a radio interview. As of Monday, about 50,000 names will come off the FCA\u2019s public register as whole swathes of staff will no longer be authorised by the regulator but instead \u201ccertified\u201d by their managers. Under the senior manager regime, 7,000 senior bankers and 3,500 top insurers will be deemed to be covered. McDermott said the need for a public register could be part of the consultation that will take place when the regime is extended beyond banks and big insurers in 2018. The FCA is facing calls to ensure that it keeps track of the certification process, which could cover 30,000 staff. \u201cPutting the onus on institutions to assess fitness and propriety will no doubt raise its own problems,\u201d said Julie Matheson, regulatory partner at law firm Kingsley Napley. \u201cOne firm\u2019s consideration of what meets this standard may differ to another\u2019s. This will always be a matter of judgment for the senior managers involved in assessing issues raised.\u201d Arpita Dutt, a partner at employment lawyers Brahams Dutt Badrick French, said the new rules could put off those seeking promotion. Dutt said: \u201cThe senior managers regime places a heavier compliance and policing function on senior individuals compared to the rest of Europe and the main global financial and insurance markets. Inevitably we may see bankers being paid more to justify the additional liabilities they are being required to accept.\u201d McDermott said that those who were already acting in a responsible manner should have little to fear, a view echoed by some lawyers. \u201cIndividuals identified as senior managers may be kept awake at night at first, but for those who acted in a responsible way in the first place, there should be no reason to worry,\u201d said Sarah Henchoz, a partner at the law firm Allen &amp; Overy, who doubts that bankers will leave to work elsewhere as a result of the regulations. Three changes came into effect on 7 March Senior managers regime Top executives at major banks and leading insurance companies are put in charge of specific areas of their organisation. Their responsibilities are clearly set out and should something in their area go wrong, they are held to account. They are also approved by the FCA and feature on its register. Certification regime The senior executives who have been approved by the regulator are required to certify that those individuals who could cause \u201csignificant harm\u201d are suitable and honest to hold their roles. They are recertified every year. This changes from the current regime where the FCA authorises individuals in a series of different job categories. Criminal offence Section 36 of the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act introduces a criminal offence for failing to prevent a bank collapse. The individual could be prosecuted if they take a decision that causes the institution to fail, were aware there was risk that the decision could cause the institution to fail, or their conduct fell far below what could reasonably be expected of a senior manager in that position.",
