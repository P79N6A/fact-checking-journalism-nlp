      "bodyText": "US central bank chief Ben Bernanke sparked a surge in share values on Friday after he signalled his willingness to embark on a third phase of money creation to boost the US economy. The Dow Jones industrial average closed the day with a gain of 90 points after the chairman of the Federal Reserve gave a robust defence of past central bank interventions, which, traders said, prepared the ground for a third round of quantitative easing should the economic picture worsen. France's CAC and the German DAX closed up 1%. In his much anticipated a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Bernanke described the current economic situation as \"far from satisfactory\". He said that high rates of unemployment were a \"grave concern, not only because of the enormous suffering and waste of human talent it entails, but also because persistently high levels of unemployment will wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for years\". His speech to the annual central bank symposium came ahead of September's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open markets committee (FOMC), which sets US economic policy. Recently released minutes from its last meeting show the committee has become increasingly concerned about the US recovery and is weighing further action. However, since the last FOMC meeting, more positive economic news has emerged on jobs and housing. Next week the closely watched non-farm payroll survey of monthly employment trends will be released. After a sharp rise over the winter, job growth slowed in the spring, but appears to be picking up again. He urged European leaders to make faster progress in tackling the debt crisis affecting Greece and other indebted eurozone countries. His concerns that Europe may drag the US back into recession were highlighted by figures showing that unemployment across the zone remained at an all-time high in July. The European Union's statistical agency, Eurostat, said 88,000 more people were without a job in July, pushing the total out of work in the eurozone to 18m, the highest level since monetary union in 1999. The 11.3% unemployment rate, up 1.2 points from a year earlier, failed to come down after joblessness increased in Spain and bailed-out Greece. In Spain youth unemployment stood at 52.9%, in Greece at 53.8%. Any monetary action by the Fed is likely to trigger a furious response from elements within the Republican party who have criticised his past actions and warned against new measures. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, has made it clear he will replace the Fed chief, who he accuses of putting taxpayers' cash at risk, if he is elected in November. The House financial services committee chairman, Spencer Bachus, told Bernanke last month at a congressional hearing: \"The truth is the Federal Reserve cannot rescue Americans from the consequences of failed economic and regulatory policies passed by Congress and signed by the president.\" The initial US quantitative easing programme from November 2008 to May 2010 saw the Fed buy $1.75tn in debt held by mortgage providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a range of mortgage-backed securities and government bonds, mostly from the country's 3,000 banks. A second round, dubbed QE2, involved an additional $600bn. \"Operation Twist\" began in September 2011 with a pledge to swap $400bn in short-term loans for longer term bonds, with an extension in June adding a further $267bn. Bernanke offered a strong defence of his actions at Jackson Hole. \"A balanced reading of the evidence supports the conclusion that central bank securities purchases have provided meaningful support to the economic recovery while mitigating deflationary risks,\" he said. In a swipe at Republican critics who accuse him of jeopardising hundreds of billions of taxpayer funds following the expansion of Federal Reserve loans, he said loans by the Fed since the bank rescues of 2008 had earned money for the exchequer. David Zervos, head of global fixed income strategy at US investment bank Jefferies, said it was unlikely the Fed would back a further round of central bank lending before the presidential election in November. \"The idea that the Fed would come out with unconventional monetary policy, such as credit easing of some kind, seems to be a little bit of a stretch,\" he said. \"This was a backstop speech that gets Bernanke through. If the data turns or Europe turns, then the Fed is back in.\" Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services, said: \"It sure sounds to me like he is getting ready to act.\" He said the FOMC would now be waiting for the non-farm payroll figures. In July, the US added 163,000 new jobs, more than many economists had expected. Faucher is predicting that 130,000 new jobs were added in August, while other analysts are expecting about 100,000. \"If it comes in below 100,000, I think the Fed will act,\" he said. \"That would be four out of five months below 100,000. That's not good enough.\"",

      "bodyText": "Spain will inject emergency capital into the country's biggest ailing bank, Bankia, as it puts into place reforms to allow loss-making banks to receive eurozone bailout money. The move came after Bankia admitted losing more than \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.168bn) in the first half year and as the conservative government of prime minister Mariano Rajoy delayed a decision on losses to be absorbed by small investors in bailed out banks. The Fund for the Orderly Bank Restructuring (Frob) said Bankia's restructuring plan should be ready by October, allowing eurozone rescue money to arrive in November. \"While the restructuring process is completed, the Frob intends to inject capital shortly,\" it said. This would be an advance on the eurozone money. The Spanish government passed an ambitious banking law on Friday pledging once more that this would be the definitive shakeup for its finance sector that needs up to a \u20ac100bn (\u00a380bn) bailout. \"This brings reform of the finance system to its crowning point,\" the deputy prime minister, Soraya Saenz de Santamar\u00eda, said as the government presented its third reform in six months. A so-called \"bad bank\" will swallow large amounts of the toxic real estate that has brought down several Spanish banks and threatens several more. The property is left over from the housing construction bubble that burst in 2008, just as the credit crunch happened, and which lies at the root of Spain's double-dip recession and 25% unemployment. The bad bank will receive building plots, unfinished developments and possibly tens of thousands of unsold homes from developers who went bust or are struggling to repay loans. It will be expected to sell this stock at a profit over the next 10 to 15 years. \"It will be viable and will not post losses,\" the finance minister, Luis de Guindos, said. The creation of the bad bank \u2013 which the government hoped would be mostly privately financed \u2013 was one of the demands made by the eurozone countries providing the \u20ac100bn loan facility to Spain's banks. The law also creates a process for breaking up and winding down banks, while ensuring that small savers who invested widely in risky preference shares in banks would bear some of the losses when they are bailed out. The decision to use the Frob to inject capital into Bankia rather than an emergency facility set aside by the eurozone rescue fund, came as the finance ministry failed to give full details of what losses would be born by shareholders and small investors who bought hybrid preference shares in banks that receive eurozone money. Those losses may now not be made public until after regional elections in Galicia and the Basque country in October. De Guindos did not say what price the bad bank would pay for toxic assets, but promised a transparent system. This should be in place by December. \"The reform is a step in the right direction, but there is still much to do,\" said Carlos Vergara, of the IESE business school, pointing to doubts about the price the bad bank will pay for toxic assets and the names of those banks that are not considered viable. \"The key is at what price these assets are bought,\" agreed Jordi Fabregat of the Esade business school. \"If it is too high, then the Spanish people will end up paying for it.\" De Guindos said the two rounds of provisioning ordered earlier this year should ease the process of setting a price as some of the worst assets, such as building land, are now provisioned at 80%. Spain's banks have an estimated \u20ac184bn in toxic real-estate loans and investments, but only some will go to the bad bank. The law also raised core capital requirements \u2013 the level of high-quality assets banks must to hold to protect them against economic shocks \u2013 to 9%. With the economy shrinking at 1.3% a year, Spain is struggling to convince markets it can avoid a full government bailout. Money continues to leave the country, with the Bank of Spain reporting on Friday a net capital outflow for the first six months of 2012 of \u20ac220bn, against a \u20ac22bn inflow for the same period last year. Spanish bond yields crept up to 6.9% on Friday, just below the 7% level seen as unsustainable for sovereign borrowing costs. The crisis in Spain's regional governments was also underlined when credit agency S&amp;P cut debt-ridden Catalonia's rating to junk.",

      "bodyText": "For generations of Lego users, the idea of building Mia's Puppy House would have been anathema. But the toymaker's new girl-friendly range has proved a hit with customers while drawing accusations of gender stereotyping from campaigners. The world-famous plastic brick maker said net profit rose 35% to 2bn kroner (\u00a3213m) in the first six months of 2012, from 1.48bn kroner for the same period last year. Sales rose 24% to Kr9.1bn, spurred by the success of the Lego Friends line, which was launched in January in an attempt to expand the company's appeal beyond boys. It has been a runaway hit, selling twice as many sets as expected. \"It has been amazing to experience the enthusiastic welcome that consumers have given the new range,\" said the Lego chief executive, J\u00f8rgen Vig Knudstorp. \"Sales have been quite astonishing.\" The debut of Lego Friends, featuring a more prominent use of pink than your typical Lego fan would be used to, drew criticism that it would reinforce gender stereotypes. As well as the usual trucks, policemen and rugged houses, the line now includes Stephanie's cool convertible in distinctive pink and purple, and Mia's Puppy House, accessorised with flowers and full pet grooming kit. Pink Stinks, a UK campaign group that raises concerns over gender stereotyping of children, said Lego was perpetuating a narrow and limited set of ideas. Abi Moore, co-founder of Pink Stinks, said: \"It's not surprising that profits are up, but they probably are for toy makers who are gender-stereotyping everything in sight.\" She added: \"We want toys that offer all sorts of opportunities to all children. We think that cupcakes, parties and having everything revolve around leisure is just tiresome and heavily stereotyped. The loudest protest against the range came from the US, where the Spark movement against the sexualisation of girls and young women organised a petition with more than 50,000 signatures calling on Lego to change its marketing strategy. Eating disorder specialists have also criticised the line, which has slim figurines called Stephanie, Andrea and Olivia who represent a significant change to Lego's typical square-set characters. However, Lego's results indicated that the company had got its product design and marketing right, having drawn up the new line amid requests from parents and girls for more realistic and detailed sets with brighter colours and role playing opportunities. Lego said Lego ranges had been popular with girls in the past but the company has struggled to match its success with boys. The Friends range was the product of research with 3,000 girls, Lego said. \"Girls like construction toys but they just want it to be relevant to them.\" Girls who didn't find Lego relevant before seem to have found relevance in Lego Friends.\" Lego said a weakening toy market had not damaged the privately-owned business, with its share of the global toy market growing by one percentage point to more than 8%. European sales rose by 10%, Lego said, with the US climbing 23% and Asia increasing \"at an even steeper rate\". The company expects to hire an extra 1,000 employees this year \u2013 a 10% boost to its workforce \u2013 as it meets growing demand, including increased production of the Friends line. However, Lego City and Lego Star Wars remain the group's biggest selling products.",

Under the terms of the bond, Sesac would raise $300m (\u00a3190m) backed by royalties generated by its artists. The bankers were due to price the bond earlier in August, but reports suggest it has now been delayed until September.

      "body": "<p>Each week we look at two shops competing in the same sector, and review what they are offering customers: from how helpful the staff are to the best bargains on offer.</p> <p>Our review will be based on a visit to stores on the same high street, or online, so it will be just a snapshot of how the retailer is performing.</p> <p>To get a better idea of which retailers are delivering and which are falling short, we would like you to tell us about your experiences of the same shops.</p> <p>Some weeks, both stores we visit may do a good job; other weeks there will be one that stands out as being much better or worse. Your reviews will help us discover if this is a trend.</p> <p>This week, we compare supermarket giants Asda and Morrisons.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.morrisons.co.uk/\" title=\"Morrisons website\">Morrisons</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> The Morrisons brand dates back to 1899, when William Morrison&#xa0;started working as an egg and butter merchant in Bradford. He expanded into market stalls in the local area and in 1958 Morrisons opened its first self-service shop in the city.</p> <p>Business boomed under the control of William's son Ken, and it purchased rival supermarket chain Safeway in 2004 in order to expand its presence in Scotland and the south of England. It currently has about 450 stores.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 10.30am, 20 August, Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Groceries and homewares.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> My eyes were immediately drawn to an amazing display of fresh fruit and vegetables on beds of ice at the front of the store, with cold mist&#xa0;sprays built into the shelves to keep the produce fresh. Around the edge of the store were counters serving fresh fish, meats, pastries and cakes, as well as a popular salad bar. There was a dedicated area for upmarket, yet competitively priced ready meals, while groceries took up most of the centre of the store and freezer aisles occupied the rear.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> Chatty. From the older woman at the deli counter to the young man at the tills, everyone seemed eager to have a natter.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> Four medium white baps for 32p.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Onions, \u00a31.05 a kg; 1l bottle of Robinsons orange squash,&#xa0;\u00a31; 400ml bottle of Head and Shoulders shampoo, \u00a34.99; PG Tips tea bags (pack of 80), \u00a32.14; 530ml bottle of Fairy Liquid, \u00a31.65 (or two for \u00a32).</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There were 22 tills in the store, nine of which were manned. Customers also had the option of using one of the six self-service tills or a small kiosk selling newspapers and cigarettes near the entrance.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> An impressive experience. Although not a vast superstore, this branch of Morrisons contained a good selection of products and had an excellent range of special offers, both on the end of the aisles and dotted around the store. Outside of food, it also had a children's clothing section as well as a small but solid range of household appliances and homewares.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 8/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.asda.com/\" title=\"Asda website\">Asda</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> Founded in Leeds in 1949, Asda has since grown into a retailing behemoth. The chain operated predominantly in the north of England until an expansion programme in the early 1990s enhanced its reach. It was bought by American retailing giant Wal-Mart in 1999 and now operates about 300 UK superstores alongside a number of smaller convenience and non-food stores.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 11.45am, 20 August, Stockton-on-Tees.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Groceries, clothing and homeware.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> This two-level store offered a massive range of products in a bright, airy atmosphere. The mezzanine level contained a cafe, homewares and a large clothing section, while the ground floor contained a pharmacy, home electronics and a comprehensive range of groceries.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> The checkout staff were quick and pleasant, with plenty more stacking shelves and fielding customer queries.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> A pack of four standard tins of Heinz tomato soup for \u00a32.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> Onions, 90p a kg; 1l bottle of Robinsons orange squash,&#xa0;\u00a31.39; 400ml bottle of Head and Shoulders shampoo, \u00a34.98; PG Tips tea bags (pack of 80), \u00a32.14; 433ml bottle of Fairy Liquid, \u00a31.25.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There were 25 standard tills, of which 11 were manned, with a further eight self-service machines and a newspaper kiosk also available.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> Asda's store was huge \u2013 perhaps too big \u2013 taking a considerable amount of time to walk around its two levels. But that allowed it to stock a vast range of products, all competitively priced against other major supermarkets \u2013 a point the in-store advertising made abundantly clear.</p> <p>While it was busy, the store remained easy to navigate thanks to the wide aisles and good signposting on the lower level. Upstairs, Asda's non-food selection was excellent, with a wide enough range of George clothing to fill a shop of its own.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 7/10.</p> <p><strong>Adam's verdict</strong> Asda contained numerous posters detailing how much cheaper they are than other supermarkets, which generally seemed to be the case, although several products were just a penny cheaper than Morrisons and the latter came out top when it came to its special offers.</p> <p>Morrisons also outclassed Asda when it came to the range of fresh products on offer, from the impressive fruit and veg stands to the bakery and fish counter, where a dedicated fishmonger was on hand to give advice and prepare fish to order.</p> <p>Outside of food, Asda's range of clothing and electrical goods was comprehensive. This was an area where Morrisons was unable to match its rival, although a range of basic appliances and kids clothing added some variation to its store.</p> <h2>Last week</h2> <p>In the battle of the takeaway pizza retailers Domino was king, taking 46% of your votes. Rival Pizza Hut was the preferred choice of just 20% of voters, with the remainder saying they would choose another pizzeria entirely.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17876162\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">WelshPaul</a> sang the praises of a good alternative near where he lives:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Our local independent pizza takeaway offers a superb range of toppings: capers, spinach, smoked salmon, blue cheese, anchovies and parmesan to name but a few, and their prices are always at least 3/4 those of the local Dominos a few doors down. I'm baffled why so many people opt for the Americanised pizza giants, whose pizzas are often greasy montrosities (Cheese-stuffed crust? Really?).\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17876894\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">Slowmotion</a> spoke up for Dominos' customer service, if not the pizza:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Domino's online service is really good - you get to see how your pizza is progressing (\"ah, they've just taken it out of the oven, maybe i should get out of bed now\"), delivery is quick and the staff are really friendly. i actually detest the pizza with a passion but when you're hungry and lazy it does a great job.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17881355\" title=\"Store Wars comment\">Shuggah</a>, meanwhile, liked the food:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I would go Domino's every time. They simply taste better. Pizza Hut also pretends to be a proper restaraunt serving nice food whereas Domino's do not. Their large pepperoni passion is gloriously filthy, bad and wrong. It tastes amazing and only contains about two days worth of calories. Once a year for Domino's, never for Pizza Hut.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>However, price was a recurring theme with many people saying they didn't think either chain's fare warranted the cost.</p> <p>Let us know which of today's retailers you favour, or if you aren't a fan of either or think another offers better choice or prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=503f7ddce4b00ec5b7e776f1\"> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.easypolls.net/ext/scripts/emPoll.js?p=503f7ddce4b00ec5b7e776f1\"></script><a class=\"OPP-powered-by\" href=\"http://www.objectplanet.com/opinio/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><div style=\"font: 9px arial; color: gray;\">survey services</div></a> </figure>  <p></p>",

Morrisons Background The Morrisons brand dates back to 1899, when William Morrison started working as an egg and butter merchant in Bradford. He expanded into market stalls in the local area and in 1958 Morrisons opened its first self-service shop in the city. Business boomed under the control of William's son Ken, and it purchased rival supermarket chain Safeway in 2004 in order to expand its presence in Scotland and the south of England. It currently has about 450 stores. The visit 10.30am, 20 August, Stockton-on-Tees. What it sells Groceries and homewares. First impressions My eyes were immediately drawn to an amazing display of fresh fruit and vegetables on beds of ice at the front of the store, with cold mist sprays built into the shelves to keep the produce fresh. Around the edge of the store were counters serving fresh fish, meats, pastries and cakes, as well as a popular salad bar. There was a dedicated area for upmarket, yet competitively priced ready meals, while groceries took up most of the centre of the store and freezer aisles occupied the rear. What were the staff like? Chatty. From the older woman at the deli counter to the young man at the tills, everyone seemed eager to have a natter. Best bargain Four medium white baps for 32p. What does it charge? Onions, \u00a31.05 a kg; 1l bottle of Robinsons orange squash, \u00a31; 400ml bottle of Head and Shoulders shampoo, \u00a34.99; PG Tips tea bags (pack of 80), \u00a32.14; 530ml bottle of Fairy Liquid, \u00a31.65 (or two for \u00a32). Where can I pay? There were 22 tills in the store, nine of which were manned. Customers also had the option of using one of the six self-service tills or a small kiosk selling newspapers and cigarettes near the entrance. Is loyalty rewarded? No. Lasting impressions An impressive experience. Although not a vast superstore, this branch of Morrisons contained a good selection of products and had an excellent range of special offers, both on the end of the aisles and dotted around the store. Outside of food, it also had a children's clothing section as well as a small but solid range of household appliances and homewares. Overall rating 8/10. Asda Background Founded in Leeds in 1949, Asda has since grown into a retailing behemoth. The chain operated predominantly in the north of England until an expansion programme in the early 1990s enhanced its reach. It was bought by American retailing giant Wal-Mart in 1999 and now operates about 300 UK superstores alongside a number of smaller convenience and non-food stores. The visit 11.45am, 20 August, Stockton-on-Tees. What it sells Groceries, clothing and homeware. First impressions This two-level store offered a massive range of products in a bright, airy atmosphere. The mezzanine level contained a cafe, homewares and a large clothing section, while the ground floor contained a pharmacy, home electronics and a comprehensive range of groceries. What were the staff like? The checkout staff were quick and pleasant, with plenty more stacking shelves and fielding customer queries. Best bargain A pack of four standard tins of Heinz tomato soup for \u00a32. What does it charge? Onions, 90p a kg; 1l bottle of Robinsons orange squash, \u00a31.39; 400ml bottle of Head and Shoulders shampoo, \u00a34.98; PG Tips tea bags (pack of 80), \u00a32.14; 433ml bottle of Fairy Liquid, \u00a31.25. Where can I pay? There were 25 standard tills, of which 11 were manned, with a further eight self-service machines and a newspaper kiosk also available. Is loyalty rewarded? No. Lasting impressions Asda's store was huge \u2013 perhaps too big \u2013 taking a considerable amount of time to walk around its two levels. But that allowed it to stock a vast range of products, all competitively priced against other major supermarkets \u2013 a point the in-store advertising made abundantly clear. While it was busy, the store remained easy to navigate thanks to the wide aisles and good signposting on the lower level. Upstairs, Asda's non-food selection was excellent, with a wide enough range of George clothing to fill a shop of its own. Overall rating 7/10. Adam's verdict Asda contained numerous posters detailing how much cheaper they are than other supermarkets, which generally seemed to be the case, although several products were just a penny cheaper than Morrisons and the latter came out top when it came to its special offers. Morrisons also outclassed Asda when it came to the range of fresh products on offer, from the impressive fruit and veg stands to the bakery and fish counter, where a dedicated fishmonger was on hand to give advice and prepare fish to order. Outside of food, Asda's range of clothing and electrical goods was comprehensive. This was an area where Morrisons was unable to match its rival, although a range of basic appliances and kids clothing added some variation to its store. Last week In the battle of the takeaway pizza retailers Domino was king, taking 46% of your votes. Rival Pizza Hut was the preferred choice of just 20% of voters, with the remainder saying they would choose another pizzeria entirely. WelshPaul sang the praises of a good alternative near where he lives: \"Our local independent pizza takeaway offers a superb range of toppings: capers, spinach, smoked salmon, blue cheese, anchovies and parmesan to name but a few, and their prices are always at least 3/4 those of the local Dominos a few doors down. I'm baffled why so many people opt for the Americanised pizza giants, whose pizzas are often greasy montrosities (Cheese-stuffed crust? Really?).\" Slowmotion spoke up for Dominos' customer service, if not the pizza: \"Domino's online service is really good - you get to see how your pizza is progressing (\"ah, they've just taken it out of the oven, maybe i should get out of bed now\"), delivery is quick and the staff are really friendly. i actually detest the pizza with a passion but when you're hungry and lazy it does a great job.\" Shuggah, meanwhile, liked the food: \"I would go Domino's every time. They simply taste better. Pizza Hut also pretends to be a proper restaraunt serving nice food whereas Domino's do not. Their large pepperoni passion is gloriously filthy, bad and wrong. It tastes amazing and only contains about two days worth of calories. Once a year for Domino's, never for Pizza Hut.\" However, price was a recurring theme with many people saying they didn't think either chain's fare warranted the cost. Let us know which of today's retailers you favour, or if you aren't a fan of either or think another offers better choice or prices.",
