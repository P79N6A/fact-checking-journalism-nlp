Speaking on Friday at the opening of the first Starbucks branch in India, Schultz denied shifting profits out of the UK unit into tax havens. \"We don't pay income tax because we are not making money there,\" he told Reuters. Starbucks has been the target of criticism in the UK this week after Reuters reported its British unit had paid no corporate income tax in the past three years despite notching up sales of \u00a31.2bn. The report found the company had consistently told investors the UK unit was performing strongly over recent years. George Mudie MP, who chairs a committee of MPs that scrutinises HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC), said he would like to have executives from Starbucks answer questions to the committee. Several MPs have said HMRC should investigate the company's affairs. \"We will absolutely comply with any government inquiry with transparency and respect,\" Schultz said. Starbucks has rung up total sales of \u00a33bn in the UK since opening its first store in 1998, but has recorded a loss for every year since it started trading in Britain, despite US management claiming it had been a \"profitable\" marketplace. Bosses at the company are thought to have been in contact with HM Revenue and Customs to clarify its tax position.

The figures imply that women occupying jobs at executive committee level are even more scarce than on FTSE 100 boards, with the latest numbers from the Professional Boards Forum showing just 17.3% of blue chip directors are women. The data has emerged as Viviane Reding, the European commissioner for justice and rights, prepares to present on Tuesday her plan for a mandatory quota of female board directors on boards at listed companies, despite fierce opposition from many of the EU's member states. Reding is proposing that companies should be forced to ensure that at least 40% of their board members are women by 2020, although the commissioner's plans have run into stiff, British-led resistance that could wreck the idea.

The equalities minister, Jo Swinson, last week unveiled a proposed shakeup to company annual reports that will pile pressure on firms to tackle gender imbalances. British companies will soon be forced to report how many women they employ, from top executives and board members down. The UK, which supports a voluntary code to increase the number of female directors, in contrast to Reding's proposal, can argue that its approach has resulted in some success since the publication of the Davies report, which set a target of 25% of board seats being filled by female directors by 2015.

Last year, the body's research revealed that women would have to wait another 98 years for parity in pay, if current trends were maintained. Another recent report from the CMI, polling 38,843 employees across 160 organisations, demonstrated how fewer and fewer women are employed at progressively higher levels within business, mirroring the Guardian's data, which also discovered that there was a strong bias towards natural resources and engineering groups among the companies employing no women on their executive committees.

      "bodyText": "The Kremlin launched a charm offensive aimed at persuading investors that BP's Russian interests would be safe with its national oil champion, Rosneft. Igor Shuvalov, deputy prime minister, said on Friday the government would consider further privatising the largely state-owned oil group next year, while Rosneft itself boasted of having \"dynamic\" potential. The moves came as the BP board met in London to consider a recommendation from the chief executive, Bob Dudley, that it agree a $26bn (\u00a316bn) cash and shares offer from Rosneft for its 50% stake in the Russian oil producer TNK-BP. Under the deal BP is expected take a stake of more than 15% in Rosneft plus more than $15bn in cash, part of which may be distributed as a special dividend. BP said it would make no statement until all the details had been clarified and signed off. There is an expectation that a formal agreement will come early next week. The company will still have to obtain various governmental approvals in Russia and may have to put the asset sale and share swap formally to investors in an extraordinary general meeting. That depends on a ruling from the UK listing authority but BP will be anxious to ensure that there is general support for the move anyway. \"For the TNK-BP sale we will of course discuss with the listing authority and comply with the relevant regulatory requirements at the right time to ensure we have the correct approvals, including shareholder approvals if necessary,\" it said in a statement. Investors have been frustrated by the company's inability to raise its share price, which stubbornly remains 30% below its level before the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010. Some analysts have called for the company to be broken up to extract more stock market value from the business. The Russians are aware that BP investors \u2013 many of whom are based in the US \u2013 are sceptical about the operational performance of Rosneft and the political influence on it from Vladimir Putin's government. The Kremlin owns about three-quarters of Rosneft and has constantly talked about lowering its stake to 50% plus one share. The state was originally supposed to shed 15% this year but the plans were scrapped. Shuvalov told Russian news agencies that the government would consider selling a stake in 2013 and 2014, depending on market conditions. Rosneft managers and officials agree on the need to pick \"the best time\" to sell and find a \"quality investor\", he said. Shuvalov declined to comment directly on the Rosneft offer to buy BP's half of TNK-BP and the other 50% owned by Russian oligarchs, who make up the Alfa Access Renova consortium. Meanwhile, Rosneft representatives in London were busy sending briefing notes describing its structure (of part state energy company and part global corporation) as \"unique\", with production levels higher than Norway. It claimed that state involvement reduced investment risks associated with long-term projects and enabled \"responsible access\" to the Russian Arctic and other offshore opportunities. \"As a public corporation, Rosneft's main strategy is to create value for shareholders making management very commercially focused,\" it said, while claiming that it had increased production more than tenfold in a decade. But while Rosneft and the Kremlin were playing up the opportunities for BP, in Russia there was some criticism that a full takeover of TNK would strip the country's strategic oil sector of competition and efficiency. Vladimir Milov, a former deputy energy minister and now an opposition leader, said: \"This is the restart of a process of renationalisation of the oil industry, which was suspended several years ago.\" Meanwhile, in an apparently unrelated incident, a manager at TNK-BP has been arrested on suspicion of fraud. The interior ministry said in a statement that the suspect, who had previously worked in the Irkutsk regional government, had in September offered jobs in the Kremlin to two businessmen in return for payments of $3m apiece. Executives at TNK-BP have in the past had run-ins with Russian law enforcement at times of shareholder friction, with two managers arrested in 2008 amid a dispute over strategy that forced Dudley, then chief executive of TNK-BP, to flee Russia.",

It said sales had increased by 12% during the last quarter, including a contribution from recent acquisitions which was offset by a negative currency effect. At constant currency rates sales were up 2%, albeit this was a slowdown on the first half. It said: </p> <blockquote> Spectris remains well positioned to deliver on its expectations for the year as it realises both the benefits of its recent acquisitions, especially Omega, and the increase in the proportion of resilient revenues generated in the business. <br> </blockquote> <p>Andy Douglas at Jefferies said: </p> <blockquote> This is a resilient performance and better than many will have feared, with slower growth versus the first half of 2012, reflecting the macro-economic environment - this has been anticipated by the market. The outlook statement is 'in-line' for the full year, and whilst the top-end of consensus may be trimmed, we firmly reiterate our buy recommendation. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Drax</strong>, the coal-fired power station company, dropped 17.5p to 532.5p after HSBC downgraded its recommendation from overweight to neutral and cut its target price from 600p to 580p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> We are comfortable about biomass feedstock availability for the first phase of the company's coal-to-biomass transition plans. The CO2 price floor may boost the profitability of biomass but as it stands will lead to electricity demand destruction. </blockquote> <p><strong>Man</strong> continued its recent poor run, falling 2.4p to 81p. The hedge fund manager admitted on Thursday more client cash had been withdrawn than came in for the fifth quarter in a row, and warned there were few signs of improvement. Numis issued a sell note, saying:</p> <blockquote> Whilst there are some tentative signs that investor sentiment and flows have improved in the asset management industry generally (especially in Europe), Man does not seem to be benefiting from this. We continue to consider Man uninvestable, unless the share price were to fall below its liquidation value (all else equal), which we estimate as being worth 50p to 75p a share. </blockquote> <p>Finally <strong>Pathfinder Minerals</strong> put on 14% to 1.875p after the mining company won a UK high court judgement confirming it was the rightful owner of its Mozambique subsidiary, CMDN, which holds two titanium licences. Pathfinder discovered last December that its mining licences had been transferred to an unaffiliated company in Mozambique called Pathfinder Mozambique, belonging to its former local partner, General Veloso. The company now has to have the UK ruling enforced in Mozambique.</p>",

It said sales had increased by 12% during the last quarter, including a contribution from recent acquisitions which was offset by a negative currency effect. At constant currency rates sales were up 2%, albeit this was a slowdown on the first half. It said: Spectris remains well positioned to deliver on its expectations for the year as it realises both the benefits of its recent acquisitions, especially Omega, and the increase in the proportion of resilient revenues generated in the business. Andy Douglas at Jefferies said: This is a resilient performance and better than many will have feared, with slower growth versus the first half of 2012, reflecting the macro-economic environment - this has been anticipated by the market. The outlook statement is 'in-line' for the full year, and whilst the top-end of consensus may be trimmed, we firmly reiterate our buy recommendation. But Drax, the coal-fired power station company, dropped 17.5p to 532.5p after HSBC downgraded its recommendation from overweight to neutral and cut its target price from 600p to 580p. The bank said: We are comfortable about biomass feedstock availability for the first phase of the company's coal-to-biomass transition plans. The CO2 price floor may boost the profitability of biomass but as it stands will lead to electricity demand destruction. Man continued its recent poor run, falling 2.4p to 81p. The hedge fund manager admitted on Thursday more client cash had been withdrawn than came in for the fifth quarter in a row, and warned there were few signs of improvement. Numis issued a sell note, saying: Whilst there are some tentative signs that investor sentiment and flows have improved in the asset management industry generally (especially in Europe), Man does not seem to be benefiting from this. We continue to consider Man uninvestable, unless the share price were to fall below its liquidation value (all else equal), which we estimate as being worth 50p to 75p a share. Finally Pathfinder Minerals put on 14% to 1.875p after the mining company won a UK high court judgement confirming it was the rightful owner of its Mozambique subsidiary, CMDN, which holds two titanium licences. Pathfinder discovered last December that its mining licences had been transferred to an unaffiliated company in Mozambique called Pathfinder Mozambique, belonging to its former local partner, General Veloso. The company now has to have the UK ruling enforced in Mozambique.",

      "bodyText": "The European Union looked condemned to months of bitter infighting over money, budgets and the euro on Friday following a summit where leaders merely papered over the deep divisions between them. While claims of victory were routine and ubiquitous, chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany appeared highly satisfied with the minimalist outcome that failed to resolve any issues of substance and shelved some big decisions until December. The main issues revolved around new regimes and institutions to help stabilise the euro longer term by enabling the use of bailout funds to shore up weak banks directly as well as putting the eurozone's banks under a new single supervisory agency, the European Central Bank. While the leaders decided to agree the legal framework on the new banking supervisor by January during a fraught session that dragged on until after 3am on Friday, all other substantial and highly contested matters were left largely untouched. With the pressure from the financial markets on the euro and on the borrowing costs of weak single currency members relatively low, it appeared that EU leaders felt less need to take bolder decisions. If the January deadline is met \u2014 a big if, given the web of complex and controversial issues entailed in designing an effective banking supervisor for the eurozone while meeting the objections of the 10 countries not in the currency \u2014 it will then take several months at least for the supervisory authority to be functioning. That, in turn, means that it will be at least a year before the eurozone can tackle the sovereign debt crisis more fundamentally by pouring bailout funds directly into ailing banks without first lending to governments and worsening their debt burdens. The decision to take this action came in June at a previous summit but became swiftly engulfed in confusion and dispute. The meeting on Thursday and Friday failed to dispel the confusion and bring clarity. All the signs were that, barring a re-eruption of the crisis in the markets, substantial eurozone action would have to wait until Merkel is probably re-elected to a third term in September next year. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, who came to the summit with an anti-Berlin agenda, accusing Merkel of being too guided in her crisis management by domestic German politics, said she had her own deadline for euro crisis action \u2013 13 September 2013, the German general election. Merkel denied this utterly. \"I hadn't even thought of that. That's just not right,\" she said. But Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg, confirmed that the creation of the new safety and rescue regime for eurozone banks was likely to take a while. \"The detailed questions of what should be done how, when and by whom will be tackled in the course of 2013. I hope in the first quarter but it can get dragged into autumn.\" And Merkel also left herself plenty of wriggle-room for delays: \"There are complicated questions to clarify and we'll see in December if we complete it or not.\" The summit featured the first big clash in the three-year crisis between Germany and France, highlighting how the troubles over the single currency and sovereign debt have moved to the very heart of the EU. Hollande's key aim was to speed up the establishment of the new banking regime, while Merkel emphasised \"quality over speed\" as part of her delaying tactics. The result was a compromise that favoured the French on the timeline, but Merkel on the substance. Arguably the biggest loser was Spain, the biggest worry in the eurozone, since it became clear that it would not benefit in the foreseeable future from the direct bank recapitalisation which may not kick in now until 2014. Spanish diplomats told the French news agency AFP that they had given up hope of being able to tap the bailout fund for the banks without having the loans put on the government books adding to Spain's debt level. Merkel made clear that any direct bank recapitalization, if and when it is allowed, would not be retroactive and could only be applied for future contingencies. Hollande had tried and failed to have the policy made retroactive.",

Leaders are now heading back home, after a meeting that provided the traditional late-night session - but limited progress towards solving the crisis.</strong></p> <p>There is some relief that a deal on banking union was agreed. But there are simply too many loose ends and unanswered questions. With the financial markets remaining calm, euro leaders may feel they have done well.</p> <p><strong>But the potential for a panic remains until the ongoing uncertainty over Greece and Spain, in particular, is addressed.</strong></p> <p>Here's a list of the key points:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>EU leaders have agreed the timescale for creating a eurozone banking supervisor, under the auspices of the European Central Bank</strong><strong>. </strong>Overnight, the 27 heads of government backed a compromise plan in which the legal framework will be created by the end of 2012.</p> <p>However the final details (which are still not agreed) will only be implemented during 2013 - a less rigorous pace than had been hoped. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/19/eurozone-crisis-eu-summit-banking-supervision#block-5080f3be58f96784ee290713\">Details from 7.31am</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>EU leaders have NOT moved further forward on the issue of bank recapitalisation. </strong>German foot-dragging has been blamed for the failure to agree a timetable under which the European bailout fund would start injecting capital into EU banks.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Economists and the media have given the summit a muted reception.</strong> Despite talks dragging on for hours last night, the deal is seen as limited, and leaving many key issues unresolved. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/oct/19/eurozone-crisis-eu-summit-banking-supervision#block-5080f7dfc0e343ef1abc7c91\">See 07.59am onwards</a>.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Brussels leadership said the summit had been successful. </strong>Herman Van Rompuy said Europe had made steps towards a more secure future.

Here's why:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, declared himself pleased with the summit. Perhaps he still hopes that he will eventually receive help. But tonight it seems more likely that Spain appears to have been sacrificed for the sake of the bargain: Germany would agree to the principle of direct bank recapitalisation in 2013, possibly before its general election in the autumn of 2013, on the understanding that Spain would not actually ask for the money.</p> <p>If so, this is probably bad news for Ireland, which hoped to benefit from a retroactive arrangement to shift its banking burden to the euro zone.

      "bodyText": "The European Council summit is officially over. Leaders are now heading back home, after a meeting that provided the traditional late-night session - but limited progress towards solving the crisis. There is some relief that a deal on banking union was agreed. But there are simply too many loose ends and unanswered questions. With the financial markets remaining calm, euro leaders may feel they have done well. But the potential for a panic remains until the ongoing uncertainty over Greece and Spain, in particular, is addressed. Here's a list of the key points: \u2022 EU leaders have agreed the timescale for creating a eurozone banking supervisor, under the auspices of the European Central Bank. Overnight, the 27 heads of government backed a compromise plan in which the legal framework will be created by the end of 2012. However the final details (which are still not agreed) will only be implemented during 2013 - a less rigorous pace than had been hoped. Details from 7.31am. \u2022 EU leaders have NOT moved further forward on the issue of bank recapitalisation. German foot-dragging has been blamed for the failure to agree a timetable under which the European bailout fund would start injecting capital into EU banks. \u2022 Economists and the media have given the summit a muted reception. Despite talks dragging on for hours last night, the deal is seen as limited, and leaving many key issues unresolved. See 07.59am onwards. \u2022 Brussels leadership said the summit had been successful. Herman Van Rompuy said Europe had made steps towards a more secure future. But Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso blasted leaders for not making more progress on stimulating growth. See 11.26am onwards. \u2022 EU leaders told Greece to press on with economic reforms. There was also praise for Athens' recent progress. See 8.54am. \u2022 David Cameron threatened to veto the next EU budget. The UK prime minister said Britain would not tolerate a large increase in EU spending at this time. See 12.36. \u2022 Germany and France appeared more divided than during the Merkozy Era. Their two leaders met last night in an attempt to bridge the gap between them on austerity and growth, but made little progress. The sight of Angele Merkel muttering 'no, no, no' to Hollande summed up the mood (see this story from last night) \u2022 You can see highlights of the briefings from Angela Merkel, Francois Hollande, Mario Monti and Antonis Samaras, from 12.00. \u2022 Our live blog from yesterday has all the action from the first day, along with coverage of a general strike in Greece: . Eurozone crisis: EU summit day one - live. And with the action finished in Brussels, so is this blog. Unless there is major drama in the eurocrisis, in which case we'll roar back into live. Otherwise, thanks for reading and commenting (and do carry on!), and we'll be back on Monday. Goodnight! Rating agency Fitch has just warned that the \"slow progress\" made at today's summit means there is more pressure on leaders to take decisive action at their next meetings. The full note is online at Fitch's web site. Here's the highlights: While the October summit brought a renewed commitment to ESM bank recapitalisations \"in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area Summit statement\" it has not clarified the full nature and scope of the transfer of bank support to the ESM..... and The failure to flesh out a number of the options that have been floated, such as potential moves towards greater budgetary integration, suggests that policy makers have missed an opportunity to get ahead of the market while funding conditions remain relatively benign. It's the 25th anniversary of Black Monday, and stocks on Wall Street are marking the anniversary with a little tumble. The Dow Jones is down over 100 points, while European markets are also ending the week in the red (FTSE 100 is down 0.2%, while the DAX and the CAC are both off 0.7%). My colleague Nick Fletcher has a markets round-up: Wall Street falls on poor earnings from Google and General Electric. Over in Spain, two more regions have asked for financial help from the central government today. In the last couple of minutes, Asturias became the 8th Spanish region to seek a bailout; it will ask for \u20ac261.7m. And a few hours ago, the Balearic Islands said it needed \u20ac355m. The Balaerics request meant that less than a billion euros was left in the fund to help Spain's regions: Add Asturias, and there's hardly anything left. This tweet from Pablo Rodriguez from this morning shows where the cash has been allocated: The summit has not brought much cheer to the euro, which is down around 0.4 of a cent at $1.3029 against the US dollar. Tim Kirkham, of foreign currency specialists HiFX, blamed the euro's weakness on EU leaders' failure to agree when their new bailout fund can start putting capital into failing eurozone banks: Berlin has insisted that the Supervisor needs to be up and running and be effective before the ESM can start to splash its cash. There are risks here, recognised by the French president, Francois Hollande, who was pushing hard for direct recapitalisations to happen more quickly, hopefully in the first quarter of 2013. This begs the question, is this political posturing to push the Euro lower, assisting the German economy? As everybody knows the markets hate uncertainty and we have just had a great big dollop of it with this outcome. Over to Greece where our correspondent Helena Smith says the EU summit has elicited euphoria, with media reporting that the debt-stricken country is one step closer to finally winning its next tranche of aid. Helena writes: After nearly three years of being the bane of every summit held in Brussels, there is thinly disguised delight in Athens that finally the tables have been turned. The improved climate, with the German chancellor Angela Merkel choosing to hold talks with the Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras in the Greek EU mission office rather than anywhere else, is a sea-change that has been widely interpreted as a turn-around for the crisis-hit nation. \u201cThe atmosphere has totally changed\u201d declared the state-run TV network NET. [see our photos of the breakfast in this post] Across the board there is now widespread agreement \u2013 fed no less by the latest edition of Der Spiegel \u2013 that Greece will not only get \u201ca positive\u201d report from envoys representing its \u201ctroika\u201d of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF but the emergency loans it so desperately needs in the wake of the praise it has received for putting its \u201cadjustment program back on track.\u201d This is a huge victory, personally, for Antonis Samaras, the conservative politician whose fragile coalition has been in power barely four months. Prior to the summit finance ministry officials had said their sole aim was to get a \u201cpositive statement\u201d from EU leaders even if marathon negotiations aimed at sealing a bumper package of budget cuts worth \u20ac13.5bn had still not been totally wrapped up. A triumphant Samaras announced at the summit \u201cit has been recognised that Greece has made huge progress,\u201d although he cautioned it was progress that could be: put at risk by hyperbolic statements or demands \u2026 populism and extremism, phenomena that are unacceptable for Greece and Europe. But the issue of Greece\u2019s debt mountain still remains. Despite the biggest write-down in financial world history the country\u2019s debt mountain still accounts for a whopping 175% of GDP with the IMF projecting it will reach almost 182% by 2013. Samaras, a Harvard-trained economist, told reporters in Brussels. The biggest problem that we confronted [at the summit] is how the debt problem will be dealt with overall by Europe and what steps should be taken so such problems won\u2019t exist [in future]. HS With events over in Brussels, journalist Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardo argues that very little has changed over the last two days: There is confusion in Brussels this afternoon over the question of whether legacy bad debts can be addressed through the bank recapitalisation powers that will be created once the eurozone banking supervisor is in place. Angela Merkel appeared to rule this out, in comments made to the press this lunchtime. As Reuters reports: Merkel said it would take time for the new supervisor to be fully effective. She made clear that would not lead to the bloc's European Stability Mechanism (ESM) rescue fund taking over liability from member states such as Spain for past bank rescues, and she posed extra conditions that some diplomats said seemed designed to ensure there will be no capital injections before next September's German elections. \"There will not be any retroactive direct recapitalisation,\" Merkel told a news conference. \" If recapitalisation is possible, it will only be possible for the future, so I think that when the banking supervisor is in place we won't have any more problems with the Spanish banks, at least I hope not.\" in other words, Merkel is insisting that the 'sins of the past' in Spain's banks cannot be mopped up (as things stand, the Spanish banking sector is meant to receive \u20ac60bn through a separate package agreed earlier this year). But another rumour is also circulating, that Euro officials are considering splitting the cost of dealing with these assets between the European bailout fund and national governments. Which brings us onto Ireland. Dublin is watching Madrid being offered help that wasn't available to it two years ago when Ireland was forced to seek a full-blown bailout. Is Merkel throwing extra obstacles in the Irish path by refusing to allow legacy debts to be mopped up in future? Probably not. As Lorcan Roche Kelly, chief europe strategist at Trend Macrolytics, points out -- the Irish bad bank debts are already on the government's balance sheet: Here's a selection of photos from today's summit: Our Europe editor, Ian Traynor, warns that the summit has not made sufficient progress. Only a panic in the financial markets will spur leaders into action, he fears: The European Council has uploaded the conclusions of the summit meeting to its website. It starts by warning that \" The European economy is facing difficult challenges\" and concludes by welcoming the award of the Nobel Peace Prize, with this pledge: Members of the European Council regard it as their personal responsibility to ensure Europe remains a continent of progress and prosperity. \"Remains\"? That may spark hollow laughs in certain peripheral countries. And finally.... everyone's favourite technocratic leader has been speaking to reporters in Brussels. Mario Monti offered more support for Greece, warned that the public are getting more impatient with the EU, said the bank supervision deal was a good development, and generally spoke a lot of sense. Fabrizio Goria of Linkiesta was there, and reports: Fab also reports that Monti was looking \"so tired\". Not surprised, given yesterday's working session lasted until 2am Brussels time. Greece's Antonis Samaras has told reporters that the issue of Greece leaving the euro is now \"void\". Samaras said Greece was at the start of a new chapter, but also called its jobless crisis \"nightmare-ish\". He also revealed that he has invited Mario Monti to visit Athens, as well as the French president. Over in the Spanish quarter, prime minister Mariano Rajoy said progress had been made at the summit. On the issue of a possible Spanish bailout, Rajoy said a decision had still not been taken, Spain isn't under pressure from the rest of Europe, but it's important that the European bailout funds are there. He also criticised the general strike called for 14 November, saying it would not help solve Spain's problems. Here are some more highlights: Britain's prime minister has vowed to veto a deal on the next EU budget if it doesn't come up to scratch. David Cameron said he would block the budget if it allowed a \"huge increase\" in EU spending. He told reporters: The British public expect a tough approach, a rigorous approach, and that's exactly what they'll get. If there isn't a deal that's good for Britain available, then there won't be a deal. Here are some other highlights of Cameron's briefing, via David Gow (our former European business editor, now of the Nucleus campaign group). Meanwhile, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has been speaking (basically, all the leaders are holding simultaneous briefings). It's being streamed here. Hollande told reporters that EU leaders believe things are going \"in the right direction\", and that Greece's future remains in the eurozone. The French president seemed unwilling to take the blame for last night's delays, saying \"I personally think this EU summit could have been shorter\". Here's some other highlights via Open Europe: And Hollande also confirmed that he will visit Greece soon (as flagged up at 9.19). No date yet. Angela Merkel has been giving her own briefing, at the same time as the Van Rompuy/Barroso press conference. The German chancellor defended the timescale for banking supervision agreed at the summit. She told journalists that a number of \"complex legal issues\" need to be hammered out before banking supervision can be established. Doing so by 2013 is an ambitious timeframe, she added. Honor Mahohy also reports an amusing mis-quote from Merkel. At least, we hope it's an error.... Merkel also argued that Europe needs closer political and fiscal union, including tough controls to ensure member states stick to the rules: Update: Meg also flags up that Merkel denied being influenced by domestic political issues: Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, is now speaking - and criticising leaders for not making more progress on economic reforms. Barroso said that EU has \"a growth compact on paper\", but not yet in reality and also said Europe must speed up the \"legislative process\" to create the single market (something David Cameron has also demanded). On banking reform, Barroso said: We have covered a lot of ground in the last 24 hours. Step-by-step we are creating a single banking union. Barroso also warned that last night's marathon session will continue to be the norm: I can't promise we will get more sleep at the next EU council...it's going to be a long one. Marvellous.... In conclusion, Van Rompuy said: This was a lengthy but productive summit. I am glad we achieved progress on banking union... It is good that we will have banking supervision up and running in 2013. Van Rompuy said that leaders had also discussed the situation in the Middle East, saying they were concerned about rising violence in Syria and reaffirming their commitments to sanctions against Iran. The closing press conference is underway! EC president Herman van Rompuy is speaking now. He explains that the EU leaders are all concerned about the economic situation in Europe, particularly relating to growth (too low) and unemployment (too high). But he also took an upbeat view of the situation in the eurozone, saying that there is \"convergence\" on public sector deficits and competitiveness. Journalists are arriving for the closing summit press conference - only around eight hours after yesterday's one finished! You can watch it live on the Council of the European Union's website. Well that was speedy -- the second working session at the EU summit has just finished. Spain's two largest unions have called a general strike for November 14 in protest at the government's austerity package. The choice of date is very significant -- general strikes have already been called in Portugal and Greece on the same day. Fernando Lezcano, a spokesman for the Spain's largest union Comisiones Obreras, said (via Reuters): Next November 14 we will have the first Iberian general strike in history. Iberian and Hellenic. Yesterday the head of Greece's GSEE union, Yiannis Panagopoulos, declared that another general strike would be held in Greece on the 14th. EU unions had called for a pan-Europe general strike this week, and it appears to have been answered. The question now, is whether other countries might follow.... Despite their late night, EU leaders appeared to be in good spirits at the start of today's summit talks. Here's a few new photos: Here, David Cameron is seen chatting cheerfully with other leaders -- despite reports yesterday that Britain appears increasingly isolated from the other 26 members of the EU. And here, the UK PM is seen chatting with Czech prime minister Petr Necas (or possibly playing stone-paper-scissors): And above, Mario Monti and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande are sharing a joke before talks resume. The EU summit is underway again, with economic growth and employment high on the agenda: Angela Merkel and Antonis Samaras met for a pre-summit chat this morning, as this photo shows. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, says the two leaders discussed Greece's reform efforts. There is some good news for Athens this morning -- Horst Seehofer, leader of the CSU party (allied with Merkel's CDU) said he did saw \"no reason\" for Greece to leave the euro now. Seehofer also said he might support giving Greece more time to hit its targets. He told Bayern 2 radio: I think we can talk about that, if it is guaranteed that the cause of the problem namely the Greek state's excessive debt is really removed through reforms and austerity measures. So a further debt writedown for Greece would not be acceptable..... Ratings agency Fitch has just declared that the United Kingdom's credit rating wouldn't be affected if Scotland broke away from the UK. With a referendum due before the end of 2014, Fitch argued that a vote for independence would not prompt a downgrade for the UK. It won't speculate on what rating an independent Scotland might get (although others might care to....) Today should be a shorter session than Thursday. Leaders are expected to review their policies on growth and employment, and also discuss foreign affairs: The provisional agenda was thus: \u2022 Second working session: 9am-noon BST / 10.00 \u2013 13.00 CEST \u2022 Press conference by the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission: from noon BST / 1pm CEST \u2022 National briefings in the press centre: afternoon The cream of the Euro crisis press have (groggily) returned to the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels, for the second day of the summit. They are not in the best of temper: Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has apparently accepted an invitation to visit Athens and see the situation in Greece for himself. Greek TV reports that prime minister Antonis Samaras asked the French president to fly over. We suspect the visit will be less dramatic than Angela Merkel's flying trip last week -- no need for mass security or restrictions on protests. Explanation here. Charlemagne, European columnist at The Economist, has written a must-read blogpost about the EU summit. Charlemagne argues that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande achieved real success last night, as Germany failed to get a discussion on a super-commissioner with the power to dictate budgetary policies. Finance ministers might also succeed in bringing forward the date when capital can be injected into struggling bank, when they hammer out the nitty-gritty of the deal. The losers, Charlemagne argues, may be Spain and Ireland. Here's why: Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, declared himself pleased with the summit. Perhaps he still hopes that he will eventually receive help. But tonight it seems more likely that Spain appears to have been sacrificed for the sake of the bargain: Germany would agree to the principle of direct bank recapitalisation in 2013, possibly before its general election in the autumn of 2013, on the understanding that Spain would not actually ask for the money. If so, this is probably bad news for Ireland, which hoped to benefit from a retroactive arrangement to shift its banking burden to the euro zone. Ireland had been mentioned explicitly in June. But its name has mysteriously vanished from the latest statement. EU leaders also released a statement about Greece this morning. It's a clear order to Athens to crack on with economic reform: It reads: We expect Greece to continue budgetary and structural policy reforms and we encourage its efforts to ensure swift implementation of the programme. This is necessary in order to bring about a more competitive private sector, private investment and an effective public sector. These conditions will allow Greece to achieve renewed growth and will ensure its future in the euro area. More encouragingly for Athens, leaders did also praise its progress. But more is still expected. Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras was scheduled to meet Angela Merkel to discuss the crisis this morning (not that much has changed since her visit to Athens 10 days ago) Sony Kapoor of the Re-Define think tank says EU leaders have not done anywhere near enough at this weeks' summit: (that June deal has been controversial for months -- with Southern Europe thinking the eurozone had agreed to recapitalise struggling banks soon, and Northern countries insisting otherwise. Details: Germany, Finland, Netherlands begin to unravel EU banking union plans). Megan Greene, eurocrisis expert at Roubini Global Economics, is not too impressed with the details of the eurozone banking deal. Speaking on Bloomberg TV just four hours after the summit broke up for what remained of the night, Greene explains: Leaders have agreed to agree on the issue of banking supervision, which is something they have done before. They're going to establish the legislative framework by the end of the year - but we need to see how bank recapitalisation will work. Greene believes that the EU's failure to agree a timescale for the recapitalisation of eurozone banks is a \"victory for Merkel\". She also argues that Europe still has a long way to go on fiscal union and political union, even if it is making some strides on banking union. French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has taken a quite different approach from Angela Merkel (see 8.09) - showing the two leaders have not patched up their differences during the summit. Paris is welcoming the news that the eurozone will have the legal framework for a banking supervisor by 1 January 2013 -- and arguing that bank recapitalision could follow soon afterwards. Hollande told reporters that: The quicker the mechanism is in place, the sooner recapitalisation can take place. Angela Merkel was in a defiant mood when she spoke to journalists a few hours ago. The German chancellor insisted she was right not to allow the new eurozone banking supervisor to immediately start pumping capital into (to take just one example) Spain's battered banks. Merkel's argument is that it's better to get banking supervision right, rather than to do it quickly \"in one or two months.\" Our goal is banking supervision that\u2019s worthy of the name, because we want to create something that\u2019s better than what we currently have. But a slower approach is also politically attractive to Merkel - who faces a general election in autumn 2013. The European press are giving the banking supervision deal a cautious welcome, but point out that German resistance means that banks won't get recapitalised as quickly as some have hoped. Here's a round-up: Bloomberg: EU Aims For Euro-Area Bank Supervision To Start In 2013 European leaders committed to their goal of establishing a euro-area bank supervisor by year-end, opening the prospect of direct aid to Spain\u2019s banking sector. The EU will seek to agree on a framework that makes the European Central Bank the main supervisor by Jan. 1, according to conclusions released early today after leaders met at a summit in Brussels. The new system, intended to break the link between banks and governments at the root of the region\u2019s financial crisis, will phase in over the next year and could cover all 6,000 euro-area banks by Jan. 1, 2014. FINANCIAL TIMES: EU leaders strike deal on bank oversight European leaders have agreed a timetable to set up a single eurozone-wide banking supervisor run by the European Central Bank over the course of next year, a rapid pace that marks a victory for a French-led group that had pushed for a quick first step towards a banking union for the single currency. But at an EU summit that stretched into the early hours of Friday morning, leaders failed to agree on the second key step in the process: when the eurozone\u2019s \u20ac500bn rescue fund will be able to start injecting cash directly into failing European banks, giving in to German resistance. WSJ: Europe Leaders Agree on Banking Supervisor European leaders early Friday agreed to have a new supervisor for euro-zone banks up and running next year, a step that will pave the way for the bloc's bailout fund to pump capital directly into banks throughout the single-currency area...... Friday's announcement is a disappointment for some officials at the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, who had hoped to have the supervisor operational at the start of 2013. The leaders also discussed plans for a common budget for the 17 euro-zone nations that could be used to absorb economic shocks impacting one part of the euro zone but not others. But Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the commission president, said: \"This is something for the medium and longer term.\" European president Herman Van Rompuy announced the deal on euro banking supervision a few hours ago in Brussels. Van Rompuy told the European press pack that agreeing a timetable for the creation of a legal framework for the new European Central Bank-based supervisor (by the end of the year) was an important move. Van Rompuy said: We have a date in place now for the legislative framework, which we didn\u2019t have before \u2013 and that in itself is an important step forward. HVR warned, though, that the Single Supervisory Mechanism is not enough on its own. Europe also needs other steps, he added, including \"harmonising national resolution and deposit guarantee schemes\". The full remarks are online here. Van Rompuy also conceded that Thursday's session had rather dragged on (the press briefings happened HOURS later than planned: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other events in the world economy. It's the second day of the EU summit in Brussels, where European leaders are gathered to discuss the crisis and look for some solutions. If you were with us last night (or indeed early this morning), you'll know that the leaders have reached a deal on eurozone banking supervision. The plan looks like a classic European compromise -- the legislative framework to set up a single banking supervisor will be agreed by the end of this year and put into place in 2013. But the supervisor will not then be fully operational -- meaning it will take longer to recapitalise eurozone banks. We'll have full reaction to the deal, and other developments in Brussels throughout the day.",

Even with these numbers we are still borrowing historically a very large sum of money indeed and it is right that we continue to focus on getting the deficit down.\"</p> <p>The budget deficit was the lowest for a September since 2008, another pleasant surprise for the government in a week in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/17/uk-unemployment-falls-lowest-ons\" title=\"\">employment rose to a record high</a>.</p> <p>\"After a poor first four months of the year when borrowing was higher than a year earlier, this has now reversed and borrowing is falling relative to the same month a year earlier,\" noted Alan Clarke at Scotiabank. \"The public finances are not looking like the disaster that they previously did.\"</p> <p>Public sector net borrowing, excluding the 2008 banking bailouts, was \u00a312.8bn, compared with \u00a313.5bn in September 2011, the Office for National Statistics said.

      "bodyText": "The government's finances look far less grim than feared in the first six months of the tax year, taking some of the pressure off George Osborne ahead of December's autumn statement. However, the improvement is probably not enough to allow the chancellor to meet his fiscal targets and some economists believe he may have to change his fiscal rules. In a double dose of good news for the chancellor, official figures showed that the government borrowed less than expected last month as a pickup in economic activity pushed tax receipts higher, while borrowing halfway through the financial year is billions lower than previously thought. Treasury minister David Gauke told the BBC the figures were \"reasonably encouraging\", but added: \"There is no room for complacency. Even with these numbers we are still borrowing historically a very large sum of money indeed and it is right that we continue to focus on getting the deficit down.\" The budget deficit was the lowest for a September since 2008, another pleasant surprise for the government in a week in which employment rose to a record high. \"After a poor first four months of the year when borrowing was higher than a year earlier, this has now reversed and borrowing is falling relative to the same month a year earlier,\" noted Alan Clarke at Scotiabank. \"The public finances are not looking like the disaster that they previously did.\" Public sector net borrowing, excluding the 2008 banking bailouts, was \u00a312.8bn, compared with \u00a313.5bn in September 2011, the Office for National Statistics said. It was also below City expectations of a \u00a313.5bn deficit, as tax receipts kept up with spending increases. An improvement in economic activity drove a 3.7% rise in tax receipts to \u00a342bn, while government expenditure also rose by 3.7%, to \u00a352.5bn, including a 1.6% rise in spending on social benefits. Borrowing for the first five months of the financial year was revised downwards by \u00a36.7bn and, combined with September's outturn, the deficit to date is just \u00a35bn higher than a year earlier. The revisions reflect new data received from government departments, metholodogical changes, as well as a mistake made by the ONS last month. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecast in March the budget deficit would fall to \u00a3120bn this tax year from last year's revised \u00a3121.6bn, excluding the effect of a transfer of Royal Mail pension assets. Responding to the latest figures, the OBR said: \"While it looks likely that corporation tax receipts will fall short of our March forecast, the other main receipts streams remain closer to forecast. Clearly much will depend on the performance of the real economy and inflation over the remainder of the fiscal year.\" Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said \"the chancellor now has a slim \u2013 rather than seemingly no \u2013 chance of meeting his fiscal targets for 2012-13, but he will need the economy to achieve clear growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 after a highly probable return to growth in the third quarter. This won't be easy.\" He thinks it likely Osborne will miss his target by \u00a35-10bn. Allan Monks, UK economist at JP Morgan, said: \"With the OBR likely to revise growth down for next year, we estimate that the government's rule stipulating that the net debt ratio should be falling by 2015/16 will still be missed in the absence of additional measures. We still expect Osborne to respond to this by delaying the targeted date for debt reduction by one year.\" Public sector net debt rose to \u00a31.065 trillion last month, equivalent to 67.9% of gross domestic product (GDP). This compares with \u00a31.044tn in August and \u00a3972.5bn, or 63.6% of GDP, in September last year. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"If the trend in the first six months of the fiscal year continues, it still looks like borrowing for 2012-13 will overshoot the OBR's forecast of \u00a3120bn by about \u00a37bn. Given this deterioration and increasing concerns over the true impact of deficit reduction on the economy, the chancellor may be compelled to alter his fiscal rules in December's autumn statement.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Financial Services Authority could and should have intervened to block Royal Bank of Scotland taking over Dutch bank ABN Amro, the Treasury select committee has said, in a report that makes a \"serious indictment\" of the former management of the City regulator. The \u00a349bn deal is one of the factors that led to the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout of RBS in October 2008, because it squeezed the bank's capital buffers to wafer-thin levels and exposed it to more troubled loans. In the committee's response to last year's FSA report into the collapse of RBS, Andrew Tyrie, its Conservative chairman, called for the new Prudential Regulation Authority being spun out of the FSA to be given powers to approve major mergers and acquisitions. Hostile takeovers might also need to be banned, he said. \"There are early, encouraging signs that, in the PRA, judgment-based regulation is doing more of the heavy lifting than the FSA's failed culture of box-ticking,\" said Tyrie. When RBS first announced it wanted to take over ABN Amro in early 2007, John Tiner was the FSA's chief executive. He was replaced by Hector Sants, who had been overseeing the wholesale division, in July 2007. The chairman at the time was Sir Callum McCarthy, who was replaced by Lord Turner in September 2008. Tyrie also criticised Turner \u2013 a candidate to be the next governor of the Bank of England \u2013 for his initial reluctance to publish a report into the collapse of RBS but also acknowledged his co-operation later on. However, he said on Friday that his report should not stand in the way of Turner being considered as a candidate for governor. Asked whether the criticisms made Lord Turner a \"poor candidate\" for the Bank job, Tyrie told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I think Lord Turner himself said that he should have grasped the need for a much more substantive public explanation than a one-page news release when they decided that no enforcement action was needed against RBS. \"The fact that he has made that admission was a very sensible thing. It was very sensible of him to do that and also it signals to us that here is somebody who has grasped the mistake and is acting on it.\" The committee said that the FSA's report painted a picture of a \"severely unbalanced regulator\" and that even though the international mood at the time was in favour of a \"light touch\" approach, the regulator's management should have done more. \"The FSA report describes failures and inadequacies in the regulation and supervision of capital, liquidity, asset quality and a failure appropriately to analyse the risks relating to the ABN Amro acquisition,\" the committee's report says. \"This is a serious indictment of both the senior management and leadership and in particular the chairman and chief executive in place at the time and their predecessors, regardless of the prevailing assumptions and political pressures.\" While Sants was in charge of the FSA when the ABN Amro deal finally went through in the autumn of 2007, the report states: \"[The FSA] should have intervened at an early stage. It should and could have intervened at a late stage, albeit with more difficulty.\" The committee also concluded that it was a \"matter of considerable surprise\" that nobody, with the exception of former investment banking head Johnny Cameron, has been \"held meaningfully accountable\" for the failure of the bank. Cameron has agreed not to run a bank again even though the FSA has decided not to pursue any disciplinary action against him. The FSA said it had \"put in place a completely new model of supervision since the financial crisis in addition to major changes to the capital and liquidity levels firms are required to hold\". Tyrie said he believed the culture of the City was now changing in such a way that a repeat of the RBS debacle was less likely. \"I think the banks have got the message and the mood has changed fundamentally,\" he said. \"I think the financial community as a whole in Britain has got the message and a lot is changing right now. \"There is a change in culture taking place. It needs a further nudge or two and a recognition by regulators that their job is not just to make sure things look pretty in the regulatory garden and go off for dinner. Their job is to be thinking extremely hard about where the risk really lies in these institutions.\"",

We'll leave you with the latest Reuters report from Brussels: Direct recapitalisation of troubled banks by the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund could be a reality for some lenders at the end of the first quarter of 2013, a French government source said on Thursday. The source, briefed on talks between European Union leaders in Brussels, said a deal had been reached at the summit on having a legal framework for a banking union by the end of 2012, with the aim of putting 6,000 European banks under direct supervision of the European Central Bank by early 2014. The source also said Germany was ready to discuss the possibility of transferring under the umbrella of the ESM legacy assets from banks currently under state aid or being recapitalised before the single supervision system is in place. The source said one solution for dealing with legacy assets of banks could be to split the burden between the states and the ESM bailout fund, under conditions yet to be defined by finance ministers. Good night and thanks for reading. Well now it looks like predictions that the end is in sight were a little premature, according to Reuters' correspondent at the summit: Current estimates range from 30 minutes to an hour. So don't hold your breath. Just to add to the night's cheer, credit rating agency Moody's says the outlook for German banks remains negative. Well this summit has now gone on more than two hour longer than (perhaps optimistically) predicted. But there are signs the end is in sight, according to journalists in attendance: My colleague David Batty suggests the EU needs to introduce chess match style time control to make decisions. That seems appropriate as Hollande has been playing the French defence against Merkel, and seemingly losing. Peter Spiegel, Brussels bureau chief of the Financial Times, notes on Twitter that the Germans are not disputing French officials' assertion that the new European Central Bank supervision will start in January and be phased in over a year. \"Sounds darn close 2 Commission proposal,\" he adds. Although the new Eurozone banking supervisor's remit won't stretch to Britain, UK banks could be affected \u2013 if they have operations in the EMU region or have subsidiaries there. Twitter user 'A Libetarian Rebel' reckons we must check the details closely (assuming they are *ever* agreed): The worst-case scenario for David Cameron would be a supervisory structure that wasn't robust enough to really improve the Eurozone, but which was intrusive enough to hit the City. Marco Zatterin, the Brussels correspondent of the Italian newspaper La Stampa, suggests that the Germans have a different interpretation of the deal. In fact, our unnamed French official is helpfully giving a lot of detail about the banking supervision plans being hammered out at the Summit. Here's the snaps, via the Reuters terminal: \u2022 FRENCH GOVT SOURCE: DEAL REACHED AT EU SUMMIT ON HAVING LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR BANKING UNION BY END 2012, COMPLETION BY EARLY 2014 \u2022 FRENCH GOVT SOURCE: GERMANY HAS AGREED FOR 6,000 BANKS TO BE UNDER UNIQUE SUPERVISION OF ECB, DAY-TO-DAY SUPERVISION COULD BE DELEGATED TO NATIONAL SUPERVISORS \u2022FRENCH GOVT SOURCE: ECB TO START SUPERVISING BANKS UNDER STATE AID FIRST \u2022 FRENCH GOVT SOURCE: DIRECT RECAPITALISATION OF BANKS TO BE A REALITY IN 2013, LIKELY IN FIRST QUARTER FOR SOME BANKS \u2022 FRENCH GOVT SOURCE: ISSUES OF LEGACY ASSETS FOR BANKS ALREADY UNDER STATE AID TO BE DISCUSSED BY DECEMBER, GERMANY NOT OPPOSED IN PRINCIPLE \u2022 FRENCH GOVT SOURCE: ONE POSSIBILITY WOULD BE TO SHARE BANKS' LEGACY ASSETS BETWEEN STATES AND EURO ZONE RESCUE FUNDS So we might not need the press conference at all! #zzzz French government officials are taking the chance to brief euro hacks about how the new banking supervisor might work: Further confirmation that the EU summit is dragging on.... And the talks between EU leaders continue to drag on.... the very latest word from Brussels is that negotiations may last another hour (!) Reuters are now billing the changes on setting up a single European banking supervisor as a \"compromise' between Berlin and Paris: European Union leaders struck a compromise on a roadmap to establish a single bank supervisor for the euro zone after Germany and France papered over differences on priorities for overcoming the bloc's debt crisis. Diplomats reading from the text of draft conclusions of an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday said the leaders agreed on \"the objective of completing the legal framework by the end of the year\" with implementation \"in the course of 2013\". So, being optimistic, at least leaders did still agree to set up a single supervisor for eurozone banks. In a nutshell, all European leaders have agreed so far tonight is to make a tiny (backwards) change to the existing plan on banking supervision. Specifically, from \"with the aim of completing banking union legislation\" by the end of this year, to \"with the aim of agreeing banking union legislation\". The press pack is not impressed: The word from Brussels tonight is that a press conference is still expected at some point. However, insiders say that the leaders are only on the 12th point on their agenda, out of 21..... EU spokesman Olivier Bailly has presented the decision on banking supervision as a positive step, even though leaders appear to have rowed back on their deadline plans: Dow Jones Newswires has also weighed in, agreeing that the Eurozone leaders appear to have given up on the idea of getting banking supervision formally agreed by the end of this year: Megan Greene of Roubini also isn't impressed that Eu leaders have merely agreed to complete the legal work on the SIngle Supervisory Mechanism for European banking by the end of the year (see 9.20pm onwards). Jonathan Faull, director general of the European Commission, has hailed the news that EU leaders have agreed to finalise the legal framework of the the banking supervision system by the end of 2012: Faull tweeted: But as I blogged at 21.20, this is not the same as implementing banking supervision by the end of the year. Which is what many people though was agreed back in June. The FT's Peter Spiegel makes the same point: Here's the Press Association's take of what David Cameron has been up to in Brussels: Prime Minister David Cameron was tonight urging swift moves towards a banking union for the eurozone - without compromising the EU single currency. He told fellow EU leaders at a summit in Brussels that Britain backed the plan, including sweeping supervision not just for the biggest banks but smaller institutions too. And over dinner later he was setting out the need not just for a single supervisor to govern the eurozone, but for a comprehensive system of resolution funds - to cover the wind-up of failing banks - and deposit guarantees to restore stability and credibility. You know things are quiet in Brussels when members of the elite press pack have time to pose for photos.... Associated Press is also reporting that EU leaders have agreed to finish the legal work creating a single eurozone banking supervisor, and that the plan will be implemented during 2013 (as mentioned at 9.20pm) AP says: German diplomats say leaders meeting in Brussels have reached agreement on creating a powerful single supervisor for eurozone banks and the plan will be implemented at some point next year. France and Germany have been tussling over how to best shore up Europe's struggling banks. France wanted a single supervisor in place by the end of this year because that would allow Europe's bailout fund to directly loan money to banks, a key tool in fighting the crisis. But Germany has been dragging its heels because it's nervous about such loans. The diplomats said leaders reached agreement Thursday night to draw up the legal basis for the supervisor by the end of this year. They will then put it into place sometime in 2013. Our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports that France and Germany are locked in \"their worst showdown\" since the three-year euro crisis began. Ian says there was little sign of progress at the meeting between Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Angela Merkel, writing: They were seen walking together grim-faced into the summit room, with Hollande speaking to Merkel and the chancellor appearing to say 'no' three times. Nein, Nein, Nein? Sums things up, really. Ian adds that Hollande \"flatly dismissed\" German demands for a new European \"budgets tsar\" who would be able to overrule national governments and parliaments on tax-and-spend policies in the eurozone. Here's Hollande's key quotes: The topic of this summit is not the fiscal union but the banking union, so the only decision that will be taken is to set up a banking union by the end of the year and especially the banking supervision,... Merkel has her own deadline, in September 2013,\" he added caustically, referring to next year's general election in which the German leader is seeking a third term. A development on the push for eurozone banking supervision, via the Reuters team in Brussels: European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to complete the legal work on setting up a single bank supervisor for financial institutions in the euro zone by the end of the year and that the implementation of the plan would be gradual over 2013. EU diplomats, reading from the text of draft conclusions of the summit in Brussels, said the leaders agreed on \"the objective of completing of the legal frame work by the end of the year\" with implementation \"in the course of 2013\". Hmmm. \"Complete the legal work\" sounds rather less concrete than \"set up\", and \"gradual implementation...in the course of 2013\" is not the rapid decision that France et al were after. It's not the final conclusions, of course, but it suggests Angela Merkel didn't make a concession today. This is interesting - European leaders have apparently been considering the knotty problem of who should pick up the Nobel Peace Prize in December. The idea of sending a group of young people to Oslo is, apparently, gathering some support. It worked rather well for the London Olympics, after all. David Cameron has backed the idea, according to Luke Baker of Reuters. Although (and this isn't really in the spirit of peace), there's disagreement over who came up with the idea first: Another line out of Brussels: Angela Merkel is going to hold talks with Greece's Antonis Samaras on Friday morning. Fund manager @pawelmorski believes the rumour that the eurozone might buy more of Greece's debt (see previous post) will spark a rally in Greek bonds in the morning. News out of Brussels in the last few minutes - the Wall Street Journal reports that eurozone leaders have been considering a proposal that they buy Greek debt in the bond markets, and then 'retire' some of it. This would cut Athens' debt burden. However... Megan Greene, eurozone crisis at Roubini, reckons the plan would not work. She argued earlier this week that such a proposal could be counter-productive, as it would drive bond prices up: This will not only render the operation extremely expensive and inefficient, but it could incentivize banks to hold onto their peripheral sovereign debt; if bond prices are rising, then the value that banks can borrow against that collateral will improve. Meg's full argument is here. Another photo just arrived, showing Italian prime minister Mario Monti and French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande walking'n'talking after a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the EU summit. Reuters reported earlier that Monti and Hollande discussed the situation in Spain and Italy - which might explain the pained look on the Italian leader's face. Finland's Europe's minister has suggested that Britain is making a deliberate effort to alienate itself from the rest of the EU at today's summit. Alex Stubb said it feels like the UK is saying 'bye bye' to the other members of the 27-strong community, at a time when closer integration is on the cards. Reuters has the story. Here's the key quotes: It's almost as if it's 26 plus 1, to be very honest.... I think Britain is right now, voluntarily, by its own will, putting itself in the margins. Stubb's comments come a few days after the UK government announced plans to attempt to repatriate powers from the EU. This move has not been warmly welcomed by the rest of the EU, who are more concerned with holding the Union together. Stubbs added: It's almost as if the boat is pulling away and one of our best friends is somehow saying 'bye bye' and there's not really that much we can do about it. David Cameron certainly didn't make an effort to be at the centre of today's family photo.... Give up? He's on the back row, one from the end on the right hand side. Neatly obscured by Mark Rutte. Cameron spoke to journalists on his way into the summit a few hours ago, and said his plan was to push very hard for the European single market to be completed. Calling it Europe's biggest asset, Cameron said it was wrong that it did not yet stretch to cover services, digital and energy. I\"m sure you're wondering what the EU leaders are having for dinner: Well, Yann Ollivier of AFP has the answer: No mention of wine. Perhaps that's where they're going wrong. While EU leaders get stuck into dinner and those big decisions, let's mop up a few eurozone stories that got neglected earlier today 1) Italy has conducted a huge debt sale. The Italian treasury has pulled \u20ac18bn into its coffers, though a highly successful auction of a four-year inflation-linked bond. The FT reports that this is Italy's biggest single debt sale ever - and a sign of growing confidence in the country. 2) Signs of life in the Spanish economy New data showed a 3.8% jump in Spanish industrial output in August, and a 1% rise in new orders. Economist Shaun Richards was heartened by the data, and suggested that it could help push Spanish borrowing costs down. Spain's 10-year bond yields fell again today, finishing at 5.3% -- the lowest since April. Over in Brussels leaders are now sitting down for a working dinner. The original timings have been knocked off by Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande's unexpected meeting a couple of hours ago. According to the original agenda, the working dinner was due to last from 8pm till 10pm Brussels time, followed by a press conference. If that remains the plan, I'd guess we'll get a press conference around 9pm BST. Here's another snap from the EU Family Photo. I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that the top row (from left) are Belgium's prime minister Elio Di Rupo, Spain's prime minister Mariano Rajoy, and Sweden's prime minister Fredrik Reinfeld. Below (from left) it's Ireland's prime minister Enda Kenny, European Parliament president Martin Schulz and Romania's president Traian Basescu. The EU leaders just held their traditional family photo - and they didn't exactly hang around. Thus the hastily grabbed image above... The meeting between Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande has ended, and the two sides are now briefing selected journalists. The German side are saying the talks were pleasant, but it's not clear whether much was agreed. That's via my former, distinguished colleague David Gow who now works for the Nucleus campaign group. Meanwhile a French source has told Reuters that a provisional deal on banking union COULD be reached today. Here are the newswire snaps: \u2022 FRENCH GOVT SOURCE: HOLLANDE AND MERKEL AGREED ON NEED FOR TIGHT, CLEAR TIMEFRAME ON BANKING UNION \u2022 FRENCH GOVT SOURCE: DECISION IN PRINCIPLE ON BANKING UNION LIKELY T O BE REACHED AT THURSDAY SUMMIT, BUT FURTHER DETAILS TO BE DISCUSSED LATER THIS YEAR \u2022 FRENCH GOVT SOURCE: HOLLANDE DISCUSSED WITH ITALY'S MONTI AND WITH GERMANY'S MERKEL THE SITUATION IN GREECE AND SPAIN I'd suggest that any deal on banking union would be very provisional -- Brussels officials had already guided that the issue would be kicked across to the finance ministers to resolve at their own meeting next month. EU insiders are dampening expectations that the eurozone leaders might take themselves away for a special meeting tonight, according to Luke Baker of Reuters: This is the first photo we've received from inside the summit. Ireland's Prime Minister Enda Kenny (left) is shown chatting with Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite (centre) and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel. Sony Kapoor of the ReDefine think tank (and one of the most clued-up commentators on the crisis), argues that Francois Hollande is quite right to push back against Germany (as explained at 16.37) He also isn't expecting much progress this week: JUST IN: the leaders of Germany and France are holding an unscheduled meeting right now. The move is an attempt to iron out some of their disagreements before getting down to business with the other 25 leaders from across the EU. Ian Traynor reports from Brussels: Merkel and Hollande, the twin poles of conflict at this summit, are meeting before the full session gets under way. Hollande wants to focus on banking union and supervision, getting the thing up and running as fast as possible. Merkel wants to turn attention to more fiscal discipline and Europeanised control of eurozone budgets. Hollande said this was the wrong time to open discussion on a budget pact. Reaching agreement before the Summit gets fully underway could be a challenge -- indeed, one worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize..... ..speaking of which, Herman Van Rompuy has just announced that he wants every EU leader to collect the Prize in December: Austrian chancellor Werner Faymann struck a conciliatory tone as he arrived for the Summit a little while ago. He declared that the EU should \"show solidarity\" to Greece, Spain and Cyprus. Mariano Rajoy, Enda Kenny and Antonis Samaras (the leaders of Spain, Ireland and Greece) all slipped in without speaking to the press. Was it something we said? From Brussels, our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports that officials and diplomats are predicting a bit of a bruiser: Ian writes: Paris and Berlin presenting conflicting demands that boil down to a power grab by Berlin for control of other people's budgets and a bid by Paris to force Germany to shell out more quickly and more easily for bailouts and shoring up dodgy banks. Neither side is likely to win, at least not tonight or tomorrow. Brinkmanship, maximalist agendas, to be resolved needless to say at some stage in a euro-fudge. When that might be is anyone's guess, perhaps in December when Herman Van Rompuy, chairing the summits, unveils his \"roadmap\" for \"completing\" the single currency's monetary union, a work in progress. Last night leaders were to \"explore\" Van Rompuy's initial ideas and doubtless scrap over them. They revolve around establishing a modest eurozone \"budget\" to be spent on mitigating the impact of structural reforms that eurozone governments sign up to via \"contracts\" with the European Commission. Mariano Rajoy of Spain is extremely unlikely to ask for a bailout just days before elections in his native region of Galicia. The Greek dilemmas, while being discussed in the corridors and in the many bilateral meetings taking place on the fringes of the summit, have been shelved until next month and handed over to eurozone finance ministers to sort out. So when Angela Merkel declared a few minutes ago that nothing would be agreed, she wasn't joking.... Two developments of interest in Athens 1) The BBC's Mark Lowen reports that the man who died during the protests today had collapsed before the riot police began using teargas. 2) A Greek politician has downplayed the turnout of today's protests, to the chagrin of those on the streets. Adonis Georgiadi of New Democracy claimed that the PAME union did not manage a great turnout (despite appearing to fill Syntagma Square pretty effectively - see 10.58BST) Angela Merkel has arrived for the Brussels summit, and poured cold water over hopes of a major breakthrough over the next two days. Merkel told reporters jostling outside the Justus Lipsius building that it was important to move quickly, but to also be \"thorough\". The German chancellor then added: No major decisions are likely at the summit That may be an attempt to lower expectations, ready for a surprise. Or it maybe simply be further proof that Berlin and Paris are going to clash over banking union and fiscal union, to little reward. The Brussels news machine is whirling away as the Summit kicks into action. Europa's Cerstin Gammelin reports that Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande may hold one-on-one talks in an attempt to smooth out the disagreements between France and Germany. While James Kanter of the International Herald Tribune and the New York Times says that the 17 members of the eurozone could break away from the 10 \"outs\" and hold their own private talks late tonight. Back to Brussels, and here are a few photos of leaders arriving for the Summit: It appears that the man who very sadly suffered a heart attack and died during the Athens protests was 65. Associated Press reports: A 65-year-old protester suffered a fatal heart attack during the demonstration but efforts to revive him failed. The organizers of the protest march he participated in said the man had fallen ill before any rioting had broken out. Back to Greece. Unionists have told Helena Smith that the turn-out for today's demonstrations was much bigger than the mass rallies held last week to protest a visit to Athens by German chancellor Angela Merkel. Tania Karayiannis at ADEDY, the civil servants' union, told Helena: In Athens the turn-out was huge. We estimate that there were well over 80,000. People weren't afraid this time to come down town which they were when the police turned out in force for Merkel. In Greece's northern capital, Thessaloniki, about 15,000 took to the streets, Karayiannis said, adding: Greeks are becoming increasingly conscious of what is happening and it was especially noticeable that the main slogan today was 'the time has come to overthrow these policies,\" The political leadership of this country should not under-estimate that. If they don't take our opposition seriously they will bear historic responsibility for the disintegration of Greece's social fabric and the developments that will surely follow. Greece may have its peculiarities, there may be things that have to change but clearly this is not only a Greek problem. It is a European problem that has to be solved at a central European level and the way to do that is not to keep chipping away at wages and causing joblessness and poverty. Austerity is not the way out. And here's one more photo from the protests earlier today: EU leaders and officials have begun arriving in Brussels for his afternoon's summit (which concludes tomorrow), and the European press pack in Brussels are assembled to catch their words of wisdom It looks quite lively. Indeed, Matina Stevis of the Wall Street Journal reckons it's the busiest she can remember: That looks like Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, to me. He told reporters that Greece 'probably won't be on the agenda' today. That fits with earlier reports that Antonis Samaras, Greek PM, will give a statement on the situation. There have been important developments in Brussels already today, while we've been focusing on Athens. European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has rebuked EU leaders for not doing more to develop growth across the EU, following this morning's Tripartite Social Summit. Barroso told reporters that he was unhappy with progress so far, and demanded a new sense of urgency. He also signalled to Berlin to allow austerity to be relaxed. Easier said than done. The full statement is online here. Here's the key section: Very frankly I am not happy with the progress made so far. That's why I call on the European Council to accelerate the adoption and implementation of many important growth-enhancing measures included in the Growth and Jobs Compact. It is true that we have been making more efforts in terms of fiscal consolidation than on the measures for growth that were already agreed at the European Council level. We need to balance the important efforts made in terms of sound public finances with the right measures to have growth enhancing policies. We also need to move ahead with our structural reform agenda \u2013 the country-specific recommendations have to be implemented at national level. Greek police have confirmed that a man has died during today's protests (as reported at 13.40) Greece's police spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christos Manouras says the dead man's body has been taken to Athens' biggest public hospital, Evangelismos. An autopsy will take place shortly. \"There is some speculation that he had a fainting fit and other suggestions that he either suffered a cardiac arrest or stroke,\" Manouras told Helena Smith, our Athens correspondent. Manouras added: We will only know once the coroner has conducted an autopsy, but what I can say is that there were no police or skirmishes at the spot at which he died. In other words, the death was not provoked by violence. News of the death has cast a dark cloud over Greece. This is the fifth person to die during Athens protests since 2010 -- following the man who died of a heart attack a year ago, and the three people who died in May 2010 when a bank building caught fire. There is anger on the streets of Athens that the riot police are using tear gas -- although at this stage we do not know the precise causes of the death today. Helena confirms that \"there was a lot of tear gas today - and quite unwarranted too\". She adds: Greek police, meanwhile, are refusing to say how many turned out for today's demonstrations and will release figures in the next hour or so. Unions are calling it \"one of the biggest protests\" so far but again have yet to release figures. Here's our first video clip from Athens, showing how today's general strike has brought parts of Greece to a standstill. It also include interviews with Athenians, explaining their concerns over the country's financial crisis. From the streets of Athens, Helena Smith reports that rows of helmeted riot police are blocking access to Syntagma square from what appears to be every street. In years of covering streets demos in Athens she's have never seen this before - so \"obviously a new police tactic\". Helena adds: Protestors gathered at Ermou have become so frustrated they have been yelling \"you have shit under your helmets\" at police. More than one told me that the new tactic -- \"this police terrorism\" -- represents mounting fears that the parliament building, itself, could soon be stormed. \"People either don't have work or they they are becoming policemen because the police force is the only body that is hiring and pays relatively well,\" said 33-year-old computer scientist Thassos Kontogiorgis. \"Ever more of the new recruits are going straight into the riot police. And basically they are thugs.\" Kontogiorgos, who returned from studying in California a year ago in the hope of finding a job, says in December he will join the growing numbers of young Greeks migrating abroad. \"Me and four of my friends, all computer scientists, are about to go to Canada. We belong to a lost generation. We can't be creative here. Our country can give us nothing,\" said the long-haired youth thronged by protestors screaming abuse at the police. Greek Television station Skai TV is reporting that one person has died during today's protests in Athens. The 67-year-old man is said to have died of a heart attack. Very sad if true. It's very reminiscent of a similar death almost a year ago, when a \"middle-aged trade unionist\" collapsed and died during a protest (details) Reuters reckons that more than 30,000 people took part in today's demonstrations in Athens, and that the trouble began when \"a small group of protesters\" began throwing marble, bottles and petrol bombs at the ropt police who were \"barricading part of the square\". It appears that the Greek riot police have managed to clear Syntagma Square of most protesters: Our correspondent in Athens, Helena Smith, reports that the situation at Syntagma Square is now \"very tense\". She says: I am standing on Mitropoleos opposite the old education ministry where riot police have blocked off access to the square. There are lots of very angry young demonstrators - many holding rocks. There are loud blasts of stun guns echoing around, and police helicopers are flying overhead. Helena has also been hearing heart-wrenching stories of hardship on the streets. And protestors are also complaining that despite being peaceful demonstration, riot police are deliberately emptying Syntagma square. 59-year-old geologist Nora Hayiou told Helena: Its a totally peaceful march and less than half those participating have actually got to the square and already they have started firing teargas.... It seems as though we are not even allowed to demonstrate any more. And here are two photos that show the two different sides of today's demonstrations - the peaceful, and the violent: As a reminder, here's three places to watch live TV from Athens: \u2022 Zougra \u2022 Russia Today \u2022 Syntagma-live.blogspot.fr Looking at another live feed from Syntagma, it appears that police have formed lines at various points of the Square, but that peaceful protesters are still there in number: The police may be preparing to clear the square: This photo from Syntagma Square shows \"Junta HQ\" sprayed on the steps of the Parliament building, alongside a man selling gas masks (with thanks to Asteris Masouras , who is also tweeting from the scene). Theodora Oikonomides reports from Syntagma Square that four protestors have been taken away by ambulance, and that one of them was \"rather seriously\" hurt. Here's a pic of one of the wounded: According to local reports, there were riot police on every Athens street corner, with around 4,000 officers deployed. That's at least two thousand fewer than were needed to guard Angela Merkel - which makes sense, as they also had to protect the German chancellor as she travelled to and from the airport on her visit last week. Incidentally, Reuters has a quote from utility worker Konstantinos Balomenos which shows the depth of despair in Greece now: Enough is enough. They've dug our graves, shoved us in and we are waiting for the priest to read the last words,\" said Konstantinos Balomenos, a 58-year-old worker at a water utility whose wage has been halved to 900 euros and has two unemployed sons. This austerity is making all of Europe's south rebel, the euro will be destroyed. We are asked to pay for what our politicians have embezzled. Here's a better photo showing the moment that the Athens general strike turned violent, when a petrol bomb cocktail landed close to the riot police in Syntagma Square (as I blogged at 11.46am) And above is an image of a protestor (with his face largely concealed) kicking a riot police shield. As usual, the vast majority of the people taking part in the demo are behaving peacefully. The live video feed shows that marching groups have continued to arrive at one end of Syntagma, even after people at the other end were driven away. One of those groups includes the youth section of the left-wing Syriza party, who carried a banner reading \"revolt is our duty\" (hat-tip to Spyros again) It appears that many people are being forced out of Syntagma Square now. Spyros Gkelis reports from the scene that people are struggling to breath after teargas was deployed by riot police, and tweets from the scene: And here's another photo from this web feed, taken a few minutes ago. Just watched a small number of individuals throwing objects at the riot police in Syntagma, who didn't appear to respond. After perhaps a minute, the group dispersed and a large group of peaceful demonstrators marched through. Here's another image from the scene: That comes from this webfeed from Syntagma. Right now, the scene appears peaceful again.... Just seen the first motolov cocktail thrown in Athens -- here's a photo of it lying smoking on the ground (via Russia Today): The riot police appeared to respond with tear gas, and there are also reports of some other clashes between protesters and the police: The latest live TV pictures from Athens show that the scene outside the Athens parliament is still peaceful, but tense. There are clearly large numbers of riot police in attendance now: Here's a screengrab: That's from Russia Today's live feed: here. Here's a couple of good photos showing how some streets of Athens are deserted, but that riot police are in attendance: Here's a few photos showing the very large turnout for the march taking place in Athens now, organised by the PAME communist union: Elsewhere in Athens, the secondary school teachers union is marching. Here's a photo: Sounds like several thousand people are currently taking part in the rallies organised by the two major Greek unions in Athens, on top of the 15,000-25,000 who are marching with PAME now (see 10.31am). Greek police estimate that there are 15,000 people taking part in the march organised by the communist PAME group today. PAME, though, puts the figure at 25,000. (that's via twitter user @doleross ) One of the many banners at the scene reads: \"We sing and we fight. Let's block the austerity measures\". PAME's protest will end at Syntagma Square, and converge with other marches organised by Greek unions. Here's a photo from the PAME march, via Spyros Gkelis: Over in Athens, the loud chants of angry demonstrators are wafting over the streets, says our correspondent Helena Smith. Helena writes: Thousands of supporters of the militant communist-aligned trade union, PAME, have converged on Omonia square, their angry anti-austerity denouncements wafting over Athens. The demonstrators will march on parliament ahead of another mass gathering of protestors from the public and private sector who are currently amassing at the Pedio tou Ario park. Unions representing striking civil servants and private sector employees say perhaps more than any other protest to date, today\u2019s is \u201cfundamentally crucial\u201d for the message it will send to EU leaders meeting in Brussels. Tania Karayiannis at the union of civil servants ADEDY has just told me. Decisions or moves that will lead to decisions will be taken today and it is fundamentally crucial that we send a message that policies that affect not only us but the whole of southern Europe, are just not going to pass, This pig-headed insistence on applying austerity measures that worsen recession, that kill hope or any chance of the economy rebounding, are obviously totally wrong. She said that 300,000 families were now without a single person in gainful employment as a result of the policies. It\u2019s a huge number. In Greece I can say that desperation is growing. I think, now, we have to be more coordinated on a European level to stop these measures. It's not all good news for the Spanish this morning, though -- The Bank of Spain has reported that bad loans across its financial sector hit a new record high in August. A total of 10.5% of all loans held by Spanish banks have now fallen into arrears, up from 9.9% in July. Recent stress tests showed that Spain's banking sector needs almost \u20ac60bn of new capital, and today's data shows that the situation is not getting better. Spain has conducted a successful debt sale, in the last couple of minutes. It sold a total of \u20ac4.61bn of long-term bonds, more than its maximum target of \u20ac4.5bn. This included \u20ac1.51bn of 10-year bonds, at an average yield (or interest rate) of 5.468%, down from 5.7% at the previous auction. Spain also sold \u20ac1.46bn of four-year bonds, at an average yield of 3.977%, down from 4.603% on September. It also shifted \u20ac1.6bn of three-year debt at yields of 3.227%, down from 3.676%. It's a sign that bond traders are still prepared to buy Spanish debt, in the expectation that Madrid will soon apply for financial aid. On the corporate front AkzoNobel, the Dutch firm behind Dulux, has blamed the difficult European market for a \u20ac2.5bn writedown on its decorative paints business. The writedown has pushed it into a \u20ac2.4bn loss, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports. The company's finance chief Keith Nichols said: The principal concern remains the decorative paint markets in Europe. The impairment taken in this quarter is a reflection of these concerns and our realistic assessment of the markets going forward. As we cannot expect quick recovery of the economy, we also will continue to implement our ongoing improvement agenda in order to increase our profitability.\" And materials group Low &amp; Bonar told its shareholders this morning that growth in sales of civil engineering and building products has slowed as European customers become more cautious. A further sign that Europe's dent crisis is hurting economic growth. And here's further photographic evidence that Athens is shut down for today's general strike: Crowds are gathering in Athens for today's marches organised by labour groups. This photo from twitter shows the scene at the starting point for the PAME communist union's protest: And here's the scene 80km to the west of Athens, in the capital of Corinthia: Journalist Damian Mac Con Uladh reports that traffic in Athens is very light, and that small businesses which stayed open in previous general strikes are closed today. Her also tweets a photo from the scene: The two-day EU meeting in Brussels is officially under way, with the opening of the Tripartite Social Summit (the appetizer to the red meat of the Summit this afternoon). As mentioned at 8.10am, the Social Summit is meant to address youth unemployment -- one of the most worrying economic problems which Europe is suffering from. EU president Herman Van Rompuy just tweeted that: Angela Merkel is refusing to bow to pressure from Fran\u00e7ois Hollande over banking reform. Continuing her speech to the Bundestag (see 8.31am for more), chancellor Merkel said that Europe needs \"quality before speed\" when it comes to European banking supervision. That may infuriate fellow eurozone members who are desperate for Europe to implement banking union rapidly (as they believe was agreed at the June summit), so that weaker banks can be recapitalised. As Hollande argued out in this major interview, it is vital that Banking Union is agreed by the end of the year. The problem is that Spain and France want fresh capital to be pumped into struggling banks as soon as the European banking supervisor is up and running (ideally by the start of 2013). Germany, though, argues at the supervisor needs a proper 'track record' of success before it starts dishing out valuable capital. Greek general strikes, rather like EU summits, seem to come around with surprising frequency. According to the BBC, today's industrial action is the 20th general strike to hit Greece in the last two years. The Summit is the 4th time that EU leaders have gathered during 2012. Angela Merkel has just told German MPs that she sees signs that the eurozone is becoming more stable. Speaking to the Bundestag NOW, before shooting off to Brussels, Merkel said she could \"see progress on unit labour costs\" in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain. On Greece, Merkel said she had seen \"a strong desire for change\" during her trip to Athens last week. She added that Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras will give leaders an \"interim report\" on negotiations with the Troika (as a final agreement has still not been reached). Merkel also reiterated that she wants Greece to remain in the eurozone. On Spain, the German chancellor said only Madrid could decide whether to ask for financial help. Once again, Syntagma Square will play host to Athenians who are protesting about the country's plight. The ADEDY and GSEE unions will hold a march starting at 11am EEST, or 9am BST, staring at Pedion tou Areos and marching to Syntagma. The communist PAME union will start its own rally shortly, at Omonia Square, and converge at Syntagma. Also, the SYRIZA opposition party is about to hold a rally outside the Archaeological Museum. Greece faces an \"anti-austerity shutdown\" today, according to Greek newspaper Kathimerini. It reports that Greek unions plan to bring much of the near-bankrupt country to a standstill, adding: Most business and public sector activity is expected to grind to a halt during the 24-hour strike called by the ADEDY and GSEE unions, with newspaper kiosk owners and air traffic controllers among various groups joining the protest. Ships will stay in port, Athens public transport will be disrupted and hospitals will work on emergency staff, while public offices, ministries and shops including bakeries will all be shut. As usual, Living In Greece has a comprehensive guide to the disruption. The action in Brussels will begin with a \"Tripartite Social Summit\" in around 30 minutes. That event is focusing on Europe's youth unemployment crisis -- details here. The actual summit won't get underway until the afternoon, with talks likely to drag on late into the evening. \u2022 Tripartite social summit: 8.30am-11.30am BST / 9.3am-12.30pm CEST \u2022 Press conference: 11.30am-12pm BST / 12.30pm-1pm CEST \u2022 Leaders arrive for the Summit: 3.15pm-3.45pm BST/4.15-4.45pm CEST \u2022 Exchange of views with the European Parliament president: 4pm-4.30pm BST / 5pm-5.30pm CEST \u2022 Family photo: 4.30pm BST / 5.30pm CEST \u2022 Working session: 4.45pm-7pm BST / 5.45pm-9pm CEST \u2022 Working dinner: 7pm-9pm BST / 8pm-10pm CEST \u2022 Press conference: TBC So, quite a long day. Other events: \u2022 Greek general strike: all day \u2022 Greek union protests: from 9am BST / 11am EEST \u2022 Spanish bond auction: from 9am BST/10am CEST Also, Angela Merkel is due to speak in the Bundestag before the Summit - any time now.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the eurozone financial crisis, and other key events in the global economy. It's a big day, as European leaders gather in Brussels for the eagerly awaited EU Summit. The meeting will see heated debate on issues such as banking union and eurozone budgets. Spain's possible bailout and the Greek aid package also likely to dominate the chat in the corridors of power. We're not expecting a major breakthrough (but we'd love to be disappointed). Instead, there's likely to be a major tussle between Angela Merkel and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, with the French president expected to challenge Germany's chancellor over Berlin's hard line on austerity and foot-dragging over European banking supervision. Meanwhile, over in Greece workers will be taking part in a general strike in protest at the country's financial plight. Unions will be holding demonstrations in Athens, in the latest sign of public anger over the worsening situation in Greece. We'll be tracking all the action in Brussels and Athens through the day. (full agenda to follow).",
