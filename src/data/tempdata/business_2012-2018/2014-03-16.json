      "bodyText": "French energy group Total said on Sunday it expects to be prosecuted over a large gas leak at a North Sea oil rig in 2012. A report into the incident at the Elgin platform, which lasted seven weeks and led to a one-year shutdown, was passed to the prosecution authorities in Scotland by the Health and Safety Executive after a two-year investigation, the Guardian reported on Friday. The HSE refused to comment on the report's contents. A Total spokesman said on Sunday night: \"The report recommends proceedings are taken against the company for breaches of the Health &amp; Safety at Work Act and the Offshore Installations and Wells Regulations.\" Some environmental campaigners have said Total should not be allowed to frack for shale gas in Britain until it has been exonerated over the Elgin accident.

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Intimidated by her surroundings and fearful that she was out of her depth in the prestigious corridors of the Royal College of Art, Jane Ni Dhulchaointigh hid herself away in the school workshop with a vague idea of finding a new, fix-everything material. One of her series of experiments as she pursued her master's degree in product design was to combine bathroom sealant with wood-dust powder. It made balls that bounced when she dropped them. \"It was just a surprising moment. I made something that looked like wood and it bounced,\" she said. \"I just wanted to create something that looked interesting or behaved in an interesting way, which could then lead me somewhere else.\" Just over a decade later, those lab explorations have led to Sugru, a mouldable, setting silicone rubber that has been compared with Blu-Tack and Sellotape in terms of its significance. The material can be shaped for 30 minutes after being taken from the small sealed packets it comes in, before it cures in the air into a strong, durable and waterproof substance that will stay stuck to almost any surface and can withstand extremes of temperature up to 150C. The rise in popularity of Sugru, initially among the tech and \"maker\" community, has seen it used as a car engine sealant, in a school children's project to send a camera into space, and to personalise ski poles for a north pole adventurer. The youngest member of the British Olympic fencing team, James Davis, used a foil personalised with Sugru in the 2012 games. It has been a long road to fruition for Ni Dhulchaointigh, who left the RCA with a rough idea of wanting to create a \"really, really functional version of Blu-Tack that would be permanent and have lots of benefits\". A summer show for graduates' ideas showed her that the public also had an interest in what she was planning. \"I had in mind this culture of people feeling empowered to improve their stuff, to fix it and that is the most difficult thing and the most exciting thing,\" she said. An innovation unit within the university introduced her to her now business partner, technologist Roger Ashby. He in turn put her in contact with two silicone scientists. \"They said 'Does that exist?',\" she said. \"That is the same reaction that most people have with Sugru. It is a bit like other things but it just is different. It is like clay, but it is like rubber. It is like Blu-Tack, but it sets,\" said Ni Dhulchaointigh. The Irishwoman then spent the next two years testing out different formulations alone in a lab in Bethnal Green, east London. By 2007, she had working samples to be sent out to a 150-strong \"community\" who were interested in what was to come. \"It was a very long process, year after year, more or less on my own. I could see that they [the community] were finding it useful and I could see that it was really helpful. It tended to be people with an interest. I had a friend who is a carpenter and also a surfer, a cousin who is also a chef. She was adapting knives in the kitchen.\" In 2009, the company raised a much-needed \u00a3100,000 in funding and worked to launch by Christmas. Sachets of Sugru \u2013 the name comes from the Irish for \"play\" \u2013 were sent to journalists with the catchline \"Hack things better\". A video of Sugru in action went viral and the first 1,000 5g packets were sold in six hours to buyers in 21 countries. \"Can you imagine what that was like? After six years of nobody knowing what we were doing and then one day the internet went mental for it,\" said Ni Dhulchaointigh. After relaunching in June 2010 \u2013 when the supply problems that came with huge immediate demand were resolved \u2013 the Sugru \"community\" sent in pictures of what they had used the new material for, a vital feature of the development of the company. \"It was about asking people to share and tell their story so people were sharing pictures from the first batch,\" said Ni Dhulchaointigh. One user recently sent in pictures of the new Google Glass attached to his prescription lenses with Sugru, while another uses it with a magnet to set up a remote camera flash in the belly of a ship. \"If we can help make people in their everyday life think more innovatively themselves, then that is going to make a massive difference. Sometimes it is the simplest things which make a difference.\" Now with 30 staff, FormFormForm \u2013 the company behind Sugru \u2013 expects to go into profit in the second quarter of this year. Sales for 2013 were \u00a31.8m through both online purchases and retailers. Plaudits have been quick to come in. In the 50 Best Inventions of 2010, Time magazine listed Sugru as No 22 out of 50. The iPad was listed at 34. Retailers in the US are now also being supplied, while a new line has just been launched that includes magnets \u2013 in many cases being used to connect satnavs in cars. The first 1,000 packets sold out in four hours after launch. \"I think we are not sure where our future is \u2013 whether it is more a commodity like duct tape or more like Lego \u2013 a high-value brand, cool company, global. That remains to be seen,\" said Ni Dhulchaointigh. New this week \u2022 Remember hi-fi audio? Ageing rocker Neil Young does \u2013 and he wants it back. Last week he took to the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter promoting the PonoPlayer, a $300 (\u00a3215) prism-shaped digital music player, which he promised would give super-high audio quality playback. Within one day the $1m funding target had been beaten; by 14 March it had gone through $3m, with 9,000 buyers. \u2022 Apple has updated its iPhone software, adding support for its car integration system CarPlay, which will let you plug your phone into your car and control apps such as Spotify, maps and its voice assistant Siri. That is, as long as your car is a Ferrari, or some models of Mercedes or Volvo due out later this year. \u2022 Google set tongues wagging by buying Green Throttle Games, the unsuccessful manufacturer of a gaming controller for Android apps, which seems to have sold a few thousand at best. The speculation is that Google is working on its own Android-based games console to rival Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, or perhaps its own TV. \u2022 Google faces a class-action lawsuit over children making in-app purchases, like those Apple suffered two years ago. A New York mother is suing the company over $66 of unauthorised purchases by her child of virtual currency in an Android game. Apple settled its suit for $100m and was fined another $32.5m by the US federal trade commission; that $66 could turn out to be the most expensive purchase ever made on a Google device. \u2022 Amazon's gaming controller appeared on the internet courtesy of a Brazilian regulatory agency, showing that the retailer is working on an Xbox-like controller for a possible Android-based gaming console, just like Google. Current speculation puts Amazon's living room assault packed with the company's streaming video service and app store to challenge the Apple TV as well as the PS4.",

      "bodyText": "The countdown to the election starts here. For George Osborne, his fifth budget, on Wednesday, is an opportunity to rehearse the main Conservative theme for 2015: a severe Labour-induced sickness means the economy remains a suitable case for treatment. This is not quite what Osborne envisaged four years ago. When he took over, the economy was growing briskly and there were hopes that the recession of 2008-09 would be like the others of the postwar era: painful, but relatively short-lived. It didn't turn out that way. The economy lost momentum during 2010 and flatlined in 2011 and 2012. It has only been in the past year that it has at last shown a bit of vim. For the chancellor, the upturn came in the nick of time. Sure, he would have preferred an earlier recovery. No question, it would have made his life a lot easier had real incomes been rising rather than falling throughout this parliament. But he is encouraged that polling shows the public has more faith in the government's remedy than in any alternative cure and seems prepared to keep swallowing the austerity medicine, even though the treatment will continue deep into the next parliament. Osborne has been upfront about the state of Britain. It is a poorer country, he says, as a result of the financial and economic crisis of 2007-09. But he has a subsidiary message for voters: \"Labour's to blame, not me.\" The first part of his argument is true. It will not be until later this year that national output returns to its pre-crash levels, a slower recovery even than in the 1930s. Rising population over the past six years means real living standards have fallen steadily. The only comparable period in living memory is the mid- to late-1970s. The post-recession Britain is not only a land of food banks, but also a place where there is a growing army of the working poor. The notion that this is all Labour's fault, however, is nonsense. The last government made mistakes, some of them real stinkers. But they were mostly sins of omission \u2013 such as failing to rein in the City and doing too little to halt the continued decline of manufacturing \u2013 rather than sins of commission. The financially deregulated, debt-driven, London-dominated economy that blew up so spectacularly in 2008 was one Labour inherited rather than created. Osborne has also made his own mistakes. The deficit-reduction programme announced in 2010 was too rapid and too crude, a fact the Treasury has subsequently acknowledged by reversing some of the cuts to infrastructure spending. Bracketing Britain with Greece was harmful to confidence. Putting up VAT was a mistake. The budget squeeze meant monetary policy \u2013 interest rates and quantitative easing \u2013 has been asked to do too much. That said, Osborne has been a more subtle chancellor than his critics allow. Slower growth has meant higher-than-expected deficits throughout this parliament, but he has not sought to stick to the plan with even deeper cuts. That has aided the recovery, but means the deficit programme now extends almost until the end of the decade. The case for the chancellor is that he did the best he could in the circumstances. Had he not shown a willingness to get tough with the deficit, the financial markets would have punished Britain. It would have been more difficult to sell government bonds, and this would have pushed up the cost of long-term borrowing. As it is, the commitment to austerity has kept the bond market vigilantes at bay, allowing the Bank of England to keep official interest rates at a record low of 0.5% for the past five years. The pick-up has been slow, in part because the British economy is dominated by financial services and in part because of the crisis in the eurozone. The case against Osborne is that austerity has held back recovery but not delivered the promised turnaround in the public finances. In the end, the tough plans of 2010 have been watered down so that they are now similar to the deficit-reduction strategy sketched out by Alistair Darling. The bond markets have not come gunning for Britain, even after the loss of the AAA credit rating. In the meantime, he has squandered a golden opportunity to use a period of historically low interest rates to borrow for capital projects that would do more to raise the economy's long-term growth rate than all the fiddly tax changes he has announced in his budgets and autumn statements. Had things gone according to the original plan, this week's budget would have been more generous, with tax cuts designed to whet the appetite for the main course a year hence. With the deficit still running at \u00a3100bn a year, Osborne is a bit boxed in. There will, of course, be some feelgood measures, but he has to be careful not to scare the markets, not to provoke the Bank of England into early increases in interest rates and not to give the impression to the public that it is job done. What the chancellor has going for him is an economy that is likely to grow by 3% in the last full year before the election, which should give him a bit more leeway to be generous in the 2014 autumn statement and the 2015 budget. What's more, Osborne is aware that only once since the second world war has a party been returned to office in the first election after losing power, and that was Harold Wilson's minority administration after the three-day week in 1974. Risks abound. The recovery is vulnerable to a setback, either from an external source such as a war between Ukraine and Russia or a hard landing in China, or as the result of slowing consumer spending caused by weak real income growth. Both Osborne and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, are uneasy about the fact that the recovery has begun with a massive investment deficit and the balance of payments in such bad shape. Austerity fatigue has not yet set in, but is likely to do so if the recovery falters. The political risk is that Osborne is reading the voters wrong. Certainly, the electorate is sending out conflicting signals. It senses there was something unhealthy about the pre-crash economic model and that lifestyle changes are needed. It feels that austerity has somehow been deserved even though those primarily responsible are not the ones being hurt. It knows a recovery dependent on rising asset prices is no recovery at all, but is munching on the property bubble happy pills all the same. Analysing what all these guilt complexes and id impulses mean for the election requires the skills of a Carl Jung rather than a JM Keynes. The economy, it would seem, is not the only suitable case for treatment.",

      "bodyText": "A former Treasury official commissioned by the Co-op Group to examine how it incurred a \u00a31.5bn financial black hole is being paid \u00a32,000 a day by the debt-laden mutual. Sir Christopher Kelly was handed the lucrative deal by Euan Sutherland, the Co-op chief executive who walked out last week when his pay arrangements were leaked to this newspaper. Kelly was hired nine months ago to examine decisions made by the Co-op in the period leading to its discovery of a deep capital shortfall. He is expected to report in May. Sutherland walked out after 10 months, branding the organisation \"ungovernable\". His departure followed a report in the Observer that revealed details of his \u00a36.6m pay deal for 2013 and 2014. The revelations also prompted Sutherland to launch a blistering attack on \"an individual or individuals\" trying to undermine him in a posting on the group's Facebook page. The episode seemed to confirm concerns by some within the Co-op over how its management was responding to recent crises. In December the Observer revealed that the Co-op was cutting funding for ethical causes while spending thousands on Quiller Consultants, a lobbying and reputation management firm. Quiller is led by Sean Worth, a former adviser to David Cameron, along with, until recently, George Bridges, a former Conservative campaign director and close friend of George Osborne. Another contentious issue for many in the group was Sutherland's questioning of continued financial support for Labour MPs who also go under the mantle of the Co-operative party. The Co-op donates about \u00a3850,000 a year to Labour MPs. But it has now launched an online survey, which some claim presents leading questions designed to endorse a management decision to cut financial ties. Among the questions, is: \"To what extent do you think it is appropriate or inappropriate for big business to donate money to political parties?\" Gareth Thomas, the Labour and Co-operative MP for Harrow West and chair of the Co-operative party, said the group should abandon the survey. \"The Co-op Group has had a particularly tough week and it will be more important than ever now that its management and members are able to pull together,\" he said. \"Members have been voicing significant concerns about the motivation, methodology and drafting of the 'Have your say' survey and the signals it sends about the group's future direction on key issues, including the member dividend and its political engagement.\" \"Acknowledging this concern by de-prioritising, or even abandoning, the survey would be one way to rebuild trust and would be a shrewd move that I hope [interim chief executive] Mr Pennycook will consider.\" Defending the virtues of mutuals, Jon Cruddas MP, head of Labour's policy review, writes on the Observer website: \"At stake is the Co-operative party, which has a deep historical link with the Labour party.\" A source close to the management insisted that the questions in the survey were not leading, but said that an organisation in such a financial mess did need to reconsider its spending. On Friday former City minister Lord Myners, who was appointed a non-executive director of the group's pharmacies, supermarkets and funeral homes after the finance problems emerged, said the Co-op needed to take immediate action to reform, or risk its future. In a report on how it should reform, he said: \"There is a phrase frequently used in Co-operative Group circles that the executive should be 'on tap but not on top'. It is now clear to me that this is a widely held but deeply flawed representation of the reality in recent years. Elected directors have simply not been up to their task of holding the executive to account.\" He proposed a new board with an independent chair, six to seven independent non-executive directors, and a national membership council of 100 individuals, to make sure the group adhered to co-operative values. A spokesman for the Co-op said: \"The work of Sir Christopher Kelly and his team is vital in identifying the truth of what went wrong at the Co-operative Group and Bank and restoring our integrity. It is only with such detailed knowledge that we can rebuild and move forwards. This independent inquiry, which is being carried out in a professional and forensic manner, is an essential investment in the future.\"",

    "fields": {
      "standfirst": "Proposed reforms of the Co-op group, last century and this, have been ignored, and Myners is still meeting resistance even as he sets about the present mess", 
      "body": "<p>The Co-op was all set to rule the high street before, almost overnight, it found itself on the edge of financial disaster. As if the resignation of its chairman Paul Flowers and his subsequent arrest in a drugs scandal were not enough, the group is now without a chief executive and on the point of declaring a \u00a32bn loss that would have seemed unthinkable only a few years ago.</p> <p>Paul Myners, the former Labour minister brought in to clean up the mess, says he is meeting resistance from vested interests who believe a jobs cull and root-and-branch reorganisation can be avoided by adopting a fixed grin and a business-as-usual approach to running things.</p> <p>But business as usual here is not an option. After difficult mergers with Somerfield supermarkets and the Britannia building society, the grocery business is struggling and the bank was effectively bust. (It soldiers on now only after lenders, led by private equity sharks, grabbed a 70% share.)</p> <p>Lord Myners, who came to prominence as chairman of M&amp;S and later, in the Treasury, as architect of the UK's post-Lehman bank rescues, says the whole Co-operative Group is in danger of running out of money and collapsing under the weight of its debts, its struggle exacerbated by indecision and&#xa0;infighting.</p> <p>Such is the backlash that Myners has ditched the conciliatory diplomatic language that usually accompanies such reorganisations and waded into the row armed with sword and shield.</p> <p>The intention is that many heads will roll before he is finished. The easy part will be slimming down the Co-op board from 21 members to no more than 10 \u2013 with at least six or seven independent non-executives. Harder will be a root-and-branch reform of the local and regional committees that stand accused of acting as block votes inside the group and making donations to affiliated bodies to bolster their own positions.</p> <p>Myners was supposed to go into battle with Euan Sutherland at his side. But the chief executive, brought in as part of the rescue plan last year, quit after his generous pay package was leaked to this newspaper. Rather than stand and fight, he departed, shouting oaths and recriminations. Few would blame Myners for doing the same. As he documents in his interim report, proposals for reform by the Gaitskell and Crosland Independent Commission back in 1958 and the subsequent Co-operative Commission report in 2001 under TUC boss John Monks were largely ignored.</p> <p>The plan under Sutherland's leadership was to match Tesco on the high street for efficiency and use the surpluses as charitable donations. In this way, highly visible community projects backed by the Co-op would be a marketing tool as well as a good thing in themselves. Fairtrade produce would be in evidence, but most of the cash in the business would be redirected to sprucing up the shops. And cosy corners for staff to hide, especially in regional offices, would be eradicated.</p> <p>The funerals business would survive, and a 45% stake in the bank would be retained, while the pharmacies faced being sold alongside the group's many arable farms.</p> <p>But to insiders this looked like a corporate blueprint that ignored a culture and history built up over decades. It was all the more shocking, they considered, coming from Sutherland \u2013 who had been a non-executive member of the board since 2010 and supposedly understood the organisation.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the dreams of 2010, when the merger with Somerfield appeared to be going well and the merger with Britannia was seen as a stepping stone to becoming a force in the banking sector, now lie in tatters. Exuberance got the better of the top management and, as Myners points out, there was nobody with the time or experience to question their authority.</p> <p>Maybe Myners puts too much faith in a reorganised system of committees to encourage good management. But nobody could doubt the Co-op needs a clean break with its chaotic past.</p> <h2>Morrisons prepares for war<br></h2> <p>We were braced for bad news from supermarket group Morrisons last week. But not that bad. The Bradford-based grocer revealed that it had crashed \u00a3176m into the red.

      "bodyText": "The Co-op was all set to rule the high street before, almost overnight, it found itself on the edge of financial disaster. As if the resignation of its chairman Paul Flowers and his subsequent arrest in a drugs scandal were not enough, the group is now without a chief executive and on the point of declaring a \u00a32bn loss that would have seemed unthinkable only a few years ago. Paul Myners, the former Labour minister brought in to clean up the mess, says he is meeting resistance from vested interests who believe a jobs cull and root-and-branch reorganisation can be avoided by adopting a fixed grin and a business-as-usual approach to running things. But business as usual here is not an option. After difficult mergers with Somerfield supermarkets and the Britannia building society, the grocery business is struggling and the bank was effectively bust. (It soldiers on now only after lenders, led by private equity sharks, grabbed a 70% share.) Lord Myners, who came to prominence as chairman of M&amp;S and later, in the Treasury, as architect of the UK's post-Lehman bank rescues, says the whole Co-operative Group is in danger of running out of money and collapsing under the weight of its debts, its struggle exacerbated by indecision and infighting. Such is the backlash that Myners has ditched the conciliatory diplomatic language that usually accompanies such reorganisations and waded into the row armed with sword and shield. The intention is that many heads will roll before he is finished. The easy part will be slimming down the Co-op board from 21 members to no more than 10 \u2013 with at least six or seven independent non-executives. Harder will be a root-and-branch reform of the local and regional committees that stand accused of acting as block votes inside the group and making donations to affiliated bodies to bolster their own positions. Myners was supposed to go into battle with Euan Sutherland at his side. But the chief executive, brought in as part of the rescue plan last year, quit after his generous pay package was leaked to this newspaper. Rather than stand and fight, he departed, shouting oaths and recriminations. Few would blame Myners for doing the same. As he documents in his interim report, proposals for reform by the Gaitskell and Crosland Independent Commission back in 1958 and the subsequent Co-operative Commission report in 2001 under TUC boss John Monks were largely ignored. The plan under Sutherland's leadership was to match Tesco on the high street for efficiency and use the surpluses as charitable donations. In this way, highly visible community projects backed by the Co-op would be a marketing tool as well as a good thing in themselves. Fairtrade produce would be in evidence, but most of the cash in the business would be redirected to sprucing up the shops. And cosy corners for staff to hide, especially in regional offices, would be eradicated. The funerals business would survive, and a 45% stake in the bank would be retained, while the pharmacies faced being sold alongside the group's many arable farms. But to insiders this looked like a corporate blueprint that ignored a culture and history built up over decades. It was all the more shocking, they considered, coming from Sutherland \u2013 who had been a non-executive member of the board since 2010 and supposedly understood the organisation. Nevertheless, the dreams of 2010, when the merger with Somerfield appeared to be going well and the merger with Britannia was seen as a stepping stone to becoming a force in the banking sector, now lie in tatters. Exuberance got the better of the top management and, as Myners points out, there was nobody with the time or experience to question their authority. Maybe Myners puts too much faith in a reorganised system of committees to encourage good management. But nobody could doubt the Co-op needs a clean break with its chaotic past. Morrisons prepares for war We were braced for bad news from supermarket group Morrisons last week. But not that bad. The Bradford-based grocer revealed that it had crashed \u00a3176m into the red. OK, so that was after one-off costs (such as \u00a3163m written off on the grocer's harebrained venture into selling prams and pushchairs through Kiddicare, which was supposed to teach the company how to sell groceries online \u2013 but didn't). However, the real shocker was the warning that this year's underlying profits of \u00a3785m will drop to just \u00a3350m next year. That compares with \u00a3900m two years ago. Why the carnage? After four years of dilly-dallying and attrition, chief executive Dalton Philips seems to have finally woken up to the fact that the discounters \u2013 Aldi, Lidl and the rest \u2013 are eating his dinner. His response is to declare a price war, investing \u00a31bn in price cuts over the next three years which will \"rebase\" (or batter) the grocer's bottom line. Philips described his strategy as a \"bold plan\". Others might prefer the phrase \"serious gamble\" \u2013 illustrated by the fact that \u00a32.5bn was wiped off the value of the quoted supermarkets as investors realised what was afoot. The idea behind cutting prices is to bring in more shoppers and increase the volume of goods sold. However, this is not a certainty, not least because Morrisons does not operate in a vacuum. Tesco and other rivals will not allow Morrisons to become a cheaper place to shop. They will react. So, too, might Aldi and Lidl. It is quite possible that Morrisons will cut prices and not increase sales at all: it is hard to woo back shoppers who have deserted you for pastures new, especially if the new shop is more convenient than a Morrisons big-box store. At the same time, Philips is planning to launch a loyalty card, cut costs, reduce ranges and sell stores. He must also improve the group's marketing and image. So many things to do, and so many that could go wrong. China fails to dispel debt disaster fears One of the criticisms made of the Chinese economy by external investors is the lack of hard facts and, even when information is published, the opacity of what scant data is available. So an attempt at straight talking by the premier of the world's second-largest economy last week should have been reassuring. It was not.

With good reasons. Firstly, a year before King's abdication speech, he dismissed speculation he might soon leave by insisting he'd stay at the grocer \"for the long term\".

Taste the difference, Mike. Jenkins ready to cash in Another week, another row about banker pay. On Tuesday, Barclays is likely to announce how many free shares it has awarded to the 12 members of its executive committee. Last year there was a right old kerfuffle about the \u00a339.3m doled out \u2013 including \u00a317.6m to banker Rich Ricci and \u00a35m to boss Antony Jenkins. Ricci has now left the bank (you may have noticed that this allowed him to attend Cheltenham last week, after Barclays stopped him in 2013) but as the exec committee is stuffed with rookies, it is difficult to work out what most of them will trouser. But what can be calculated is Jenkins's share \u2013 an intriguing detail, as he's the man who keeps telling hoi polloi how much he \"gets\" this stuff. Last month, when turning down his bonus, Jenkins smoothed: \"I am aware of the very significant costs which have been required to address legacy litigation and conduct issues in 2013\u2026 I have concluded that it would not be right, in the circumstances, for me to accept a bonus for 2013.\" So he'll be making another sacrifice again this week?

There have been more and more whispers that HM Treasury will review the industry, perhaps by starting to tax winnings. Is it that easy? Despite the firms claiming their services are investments, only 20% of their punters make profits, so a new levy could mean 80% get to write losses off against tax.

      "bodyText": "A small firm in north-east England is on the cusp of transforming the treatment of eye disease in diabetes sufferers. Its simple sleep masks could prevent blindness and save the NHS \u00a31bn a year. And the company, PolyPhotonix, has come out fighting from the \"valley of death\" \u2013 what scientists call the gulf between having an idea and launching a successful business product. The idea of the masks is to give patients light therapy while they sleep. And thanks to \u00a312m in state funding, collaborations with Liverpool and other universities and extensive NHS trials, the company has found a commercially viable way to make them. The treatment is now in advanced trials at Moorfields eye hospital in London and is set to launch next year. This is the kind of tale George Osborne will welcome as he prepares to present his budget on Wednesday, when he is likely, once again, to espouse a rebalancing of the economy towards cutting-edge, high-value manufacturing. But the story of PolyPhotonix has a cautionary twist. When chief executive Richard Kirk approached private investors to seek funding for a factory to produce the eye masks in the UK, doors were slammed in his face. \"Private funding is very, very difficult,\" says Kirk. \"When we say that we are doing this in the UK, they lose interest. They just close the books\u2026 With the banks, we wouldn't get through the door. We didn't even get to meet the manager.\" Instead, the company came up with a way to fund its factory in Sedgefield, Co Durham, with the help of the Technology Strategy Board and one of the government's Catapult innovation centres. When the plant opens in a year's time, PolyPhotonix hopes to have doubled its workforce from 25 people to 50, ranging from apprentices to scientists with PhDs. Kirk says he was not willing to see his company leave the UK after years of grant funding from TSB, the NHS and the Small Business Research Initiative for Healthcare. Nor did he want PolyPhotonix to sell out to a multinational and surrender the next phase of research and development: this pattern has for years marred the UK's ability to transform research into economic dividends. \"Unless you make the leap into investing in the factory and manufacturing, you miss out on the learning-by-doing. The big boys get the benefit instead,\" he says. \"In order for this to be a success, I have to have a factory at the end of it. Otherwise, for the taxpayer, there is no point funding me.\" The business got this far, Kirk says, because the UK government is now, finally, trying to put technology transfer on a par with that seen in countries such as Germany and South Korea. Critics of the Catapult centres, however, say they are underfunded and their future too uncertain. Germany, by contrast, has a vast network of Fraunhofer institutes and is still way ahead. But business secretary Vince Cable says the Catapult network is working well, especially given spending constraints. \"It has been more successful even than we hoped,\" he told the Observer. \"We've done an enormous amount in financially constrained circumstances. They are working in a tough environment and already performing well.\" Cable has commissioned a review of the Catapults' progress from Austrian-born venture capitalist Hermann Hauser, who first proposed the innovation centres in a report for the previous government. The minister is optimistic there is broad political support for the centres and for the current funding model of one-third public money, one-third from business and one-third from collaborative work \u2013 jointly funded by the public and private sectors, such as European Union projects. But he concedes that Britain has some catching up to do. \"Despite all we have done\u2026 Britain is poorly placed relative to other countries in terms of science and innovation spending,\" he says. Official figures on R&amp;D spending released last week make disappointing reading: they show it peaking in 2011 and falling by 3% in 2012 to \u00a327bn. At 1.7% of GDP, Britain's R&amp;D spending is well below the EU average and way behind Finland's 3.6% and Germany's 2.9%. But business groups say the Catapults, which span fields from advanced manufacturing to cell therapy and space technology, do play a role in turning ideas into prototypes that fledgling companies can put before investors. When Kirk started his company in 2008, he used facilities at the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) in Sedgefield, started under the previous government and now part of the high value manufacturing (HVM) Catapult network. Kirk, 47, had an early career as an artist, then started a business in printed electronics before moving on to the emerging sector of OLEDs \u2013 organic light-emitting diodes, which use organic molecules to make up a display without needing a backlight. \"It was very risky,\" he recalls. \"If we hadn't had access to the Centre for Process Innovation, we would have needed \u00a330m of kit, and that would have been impossible for a startup.\" Under the yellow lights of the CPI's clean rooms, the company's scientists work with ultra-thin layers of materials in an atmosphere free of damaging clouds of skin particles and other dirt. \"You can't afford to have dust the same size as what you are working on,\" says Steve Spruce, operations manager at the CPI's printable electronics centre. Scientists can spend up to six months in these clean rooms, using multimillion-pound equipment, such as machines that spray layers of material a thousand times thinner than a human hair. Lightweight, flexible and relatively cheap, printable electronics are being developed for a range of innovations, such as pill packaging that monitors when patients take their medicine. Another potential application being developed at the Sedgefield centre is a windowless aircraft fuselage \u2013 lighter and so more fuel-efficient. Interactive OLED screens lining the cabin walls would show live footage from cameras mounted on the outside of the plane. The raison d'etre of the \u00a333m printable electronics centre is to help small businesses make usable prototypes. \"This is the biggest step,\" says Spruce, a former employee of ICI, which at one time dominated the local economy. \"What comes out of here is a product that will work.\" With giants like ICI gone, the state must take up the role of funding research and development if the UK is to build on its scientific excellence. Ross Smith, policy director at the North East Chamber of Commerce, says: \"You now have SMEs [instead of big companies], and the sum of their budgets is not the same. So it is very important to have the centre for process innovation here.\" But he is worried about funding, and shares the concerns voiced by parliament's science and technology committee last year that the Catapult centres may be coming under pressure to become self-financing too quickly. \"We need a longer-term commitment to this part of industrial strategy,\" says Smith. \"We have suffered in this country from not having that for 50 or 60 years.\" The manufacturers' organisation, EEF, wants innovation budgets ring-fenced and is calling for more banking competition and a role for a business bank in helping SMEs access finance. EEF senior economist Felicity Burch says the Catapult centres will need ongoing funding. \"The point of Catapults is to have cutting-edge equipment that businesses wouldn't be able to afford. But it will cost money to keep that equipment cutting-edge.\" The Labour party has pledged to expand the Catapult centres to offer training that would fill the skills gap that many businesses bemoan. Simon Edmonds, director of the Catapult programme, says that, so far, budgets and spending review has seen funding for the Catapults left unscathed. \"What we are looking for in the budget,\" he says, \"is confirmation that there will be a continuation.\" At the Sedgefield centre, the labs are busy and turnover is growing. As policymakers puzzle over how to boost productivity, this science park in rolling countryside is producing some world-leading innovations. But experts say Osborne must use this budget to put renewed pressure on banks and other lenders to support manufacturing. Graham Hillier, chief technology officer for HVM Catapult, says the chancellor must also put up more ongoing state funding. \"We put a lot of money into research but we don't put anything near as much into taking the innovation step,\" he says. \"In Germany, they do have to discuss budgets, but it isn't a case of whether there's going to be any money or not; it's about the amounts.\" The metallurgist stretches his arms out wide. \"Before the Catapults came along, our valley of death was this big.\" He moves his hands in to shoulder width. \"It's now only this wide. But it is still just as deep.\"",

      "body": "<p>A small firm in north-east England is on the cusp of transforming the treatment of eye disease in diabetes sufferers. Its simple sleep masks could prevent blindness and save the NHS \u00a31bn a year.</p> <p>And the company, <a href=\"http://polyphotonix.com/\" title=\"\">PolyPhotonix</a>, has come out fighting from the \"valley of death\" \u2013 what scientists call the gulf between having an idea and launching a successful business product.</p> <p>The idea of the masks is to give patients light therapy while they sleep. And thanks to \u00a312m in state funding, collaborations with Liverpool and other universities and extensive NHS trials, the company has found a commercially viable way to make them. The treatment is now in advanced trials at Moorfields eye hospital in London and is set to launch next year.</p> <p>This is the kind of tale George Osborne will welcome as he prepares to present his budget on Wednesday, when he is likely, once again, to espouse a rebalancing of the economy towards cutting-edge, high-value manufacturing. But the story of PolyPhotonix has a cautionary twist. When chief executive Richard Kirk approached private investors to seek funding for a factory to produce the eye masks in the UK, doors were slammed in his face.</p> <p>\"Private funding is very, very difficult,\" says Kirk. \"When we say that we are doing this in the UK, they lose interest. They just close the books\u2026 With the banks, we wouldn't get through the door. We didn't even get to meet the manager.\"</p> <p>Instead, the company came up with a way to fund its factory in Sedgefield, Co&#xa0;Durham, with the help of the <a href=\"https://www.innovateuk.org/\" title=\"\">Technology Strategy Board</a> and one of the government's <a href=\"https://www.catapult.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Catapult</a> innovation centres. When the plant opens in a year's time, PolyPhotonix hopes to have doubled its workforce from 25 people to 50, ranging from apprentices to scientists with PhDs.</p> <p>Kirk says he was not willing to see his company leave the UK after years of grant funding from TSB, the NHS and the <a href=\"http://www.sbrihealthcare.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Small Business Research Initiative for Healthcare</a>. Nor did he want PolyPhotonix to sell out to a multinational and surrender the next phase of research and development: this pattern has for years marred the UK's ability to transform research into economic dividends.</p> <p>\"Unless you make the leap into investing in the factory and manufacturing, you miss out on the learning-by-doing. The big boys get the benefit instead,\" he says. \"In order for this to be a success, I have to have a factory at the end of it. Otherwise, for the taxpayer, there is no point funding me.\"</p> <p>The business got this far, Kirk says, because the UK government is now, finally, trying to put technology transfer on a par with that seen in countries such as Germany and South Korea. Critics of the Catapult centres, however, say they are underfunded and their future too uncertain. Germany, by contrast, has a vast network of <a href=\"http://www.fraunhofer.de/en.html\" title=\"\">Fraunhofer </a>institutes and is still way ahead.</p> <p>But business secretary Vince Cable says the Catapult network is working well, especially given spending constraints. \"It has been more successful even than we hoped,\" he told the <em>Observer</em>. \"We've done an enormous amount in financially constrained circumstances. They are working in a tough environment and already performing well.\"</p> <p>Cable has commissioned a review of the Catapults' progress from Austrian-born venture capitalist Hermann Hauser, who first proposed the innovation centres in a report for the previous government.</p> <p>The minister is optimistic there is broad political support for the centres and for the current funding model of one-third public money, one-third from business and one-third from collaborative work \u2013 jointly funded by the public and private sectors, such as European Union projects. But he concedes that Britain has some catching up to do. \"Despite all we have done\u2026 Britain is poorly placed relative to other countries in terms of science and innovation spending,\" he says.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit1/gross-domestic-expenditure-on-research-and-development/2012/stb-gerd-2012.html\" title=\"\">Official figures on R&amp;D spending</a> released last week make disappointing reading: they show it peaking in 2011 and falling by 3% in 2012 to \u00a327bn. At 1.7% of GDP, Britain's R&amp;D spending is well below the EU average and way behind Finland's 3.6% and Germany's 2.9%. But business groups say the Catapults, which span fields from advanced manufacturing to cell therapy and space technology, do play a role in turning ideas into prototypes that fledgling companies can put before investors.</p> <p>When Kirk started his company in 2008, he used facilities at the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) in Sedgefield, started under the previous government and now part of <a href=\"https://hvm.catapult.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the high value manufacturing (HVM) Catapult network</a>.</p> <p>Kirk, 47, had an early career as an artist, then started a business in printed electronics before moving on to the emerging sector of OLEDs \u2013 organic light-emitting diodes, which use organic molecules to make up a display without needing a backlight.</p> <p>\"It was very risky,\" he recalls. \"If we hadn't had access to the Centre for Process Innovation, we would have needed \u00a330m of kit, and that would have been impossible for a startup.\"</p> <p>Under the yellow lights of the CPI's clean rooms, the company's scientists work with ultra-thin layers of materials in an atmosphere free of damaging clouds of skin particles and other dirt.</p> <p>\"You can't afford to have dust the same size as what you are working on,\" says Steve Spruce, operations manager at the CPI's printable electronics centre.</p> <p>Scientists can spend up to six months in these clean rooms, using multimillion-pound equipment, such as machines that spray layers of material a thousand times thinner than a human hair.</p> <p>Lightweight, flexible and relatively cheap, printable electronics are being developed for a range of innovations, such as pill packaging that monitors when patients take their medicine. Another potential application being developed at the Sedgefield centre is a windowless aircraft fuselage \u2013 lighter and so more fuel-efficient. Interactive OLED screens lining the cabin walls would show live footage from cameras mounted on the outside of the plane.</p> <p>The raison d'etre of the \u00a333m printable electronics centre is to help small businesses make usable prototypes. \"This is the biggest step,\" says Spruce, a former employee of ICI, which at one time dominated the local economy. \"What comes out of here is a product that will work.\"</p> <p>With giants like ICI gone, the state must take up the role of funding research and development if the UK is to build on its scientific excellence. Ross Smith, policy director at the <a href=\"http://www.necc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">North East Chamber of Commerce</a>, says: \"You now have SMEs [instead of big companies], and the sum of their budgets is not the same. So it is very important to have the centre for process innovation here.\"</p> <p>But he is worried about funding, and shares the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/role-of-the-private-sector/\" title=\"\">concerns voiced by parliament's science and technology committee last year </a> that the Catapult centres may be coming under pressure to become self-financing too quickly.</p> <p>\"We need a longer-term commitment to this part of industrial strategy,\" says Smith. \"We have suffered in this country from not having that for 50 or 60 years.\"</p> <p>The manufacturers' organisation, EEF, wants innovation budgets ring-fenced and is calling for more banking competition and a role for a business bank in helping SMEs access finance.</p> <p>EEF senior economist Felicity Burch says the Catapult centres will need ongoing funding. \"The point of Catapults is to have cutting-edge equipment that businesses wouldn't be able to afford. But it will cost money to keep that equipment cutting-edge.\"</p> <p>The Labour party has <a href=\"http://press.labour.org.uk/post/78480057415/umunna-launches-labours-agenda-2030-labours-plan-for\" title=\"\">pledged to expand the Catapult centres</a> to offer training that would fill the skills gap that many businesses bemoan.</p> <p>Simon Edmonds, director of the Catapult programme, says that, so far, budgets and spending review has seen funding for the Catapults left unscathed. \"What we are looking for in the budget,\" he says, \"is confirmation that there will be a continuation.\"</p> <p>At the Sedgefield centre, the labs are busy and turnover is growing. As policymakers puzzle over how to boost productivity, this science park in rolling countryside is producing some world-leading innovations. But experts say Osborne must use this budget to put renewed pressure on banks and other lenders to support manufacturing.</p> <p>Graham Hillier, chief technology officer for HVM Catapult, says the chancellor must also put up more ongoing state funding. \"We put a lot of money into research but we don't put anything near as much into taking the innovation step,\" he says. \"In Germany, they do have to discuss budgets, but it isn't a case of whether there's going to be any money or not; it's about the amounts.\"</p> <p>The metallurgist stretches his arms out wide. \"Before the Catapults came along, our valley of death was this big.\" He moves his hands in to shoulder width. \"It's now only this wide. But it is still just as deep.\"</p>",
