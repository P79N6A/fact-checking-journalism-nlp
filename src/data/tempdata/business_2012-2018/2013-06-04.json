      "standfirst": "Monopolistic cable providers make internet access an unaffordable luxury for tens of millions of Americans", 
      "body": "<p>Last year, about 1% of American households cut off their internet service. That's not as surprising as experts may suggest. </p> <p>The internet \u2013 which promised to connect all Americans with everything from educational opportunities to Facebook status updates \u2013 has become, unfortunately, a luxury even for the middle class. Cable companies that have functioned as oligopolies have made it that way. </p> <p>Naturally, more Americans would cut off internet service considering how absurdly expensive it has become to pay to stay connected. The median income for a household in the United States is <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html\">just over $50,000</a>, which has to support a family with basics like food, mortgage or rent, a car and gas. Inflation has steadily driven up the price of food and gas, which has meant that American wages have actually <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/29/chart-median-household-incomes-have-collapsed-during-the-recession/\">dropped since the recession</a>. School costs, healthcare and other costs mean many families depend on credit cards on occasion. That doesn't leave a lot of room for splashy purchases. </p> <p>Yet, strangely, internet access \u2013 which is a necessity in homes where children get their homework online and parents may telecommute \u2013 has become the splashiest purchase of all. In many big cities, internet access can easily become a budgetary sinkhole for families. Think of $100 a month for cable and internet, another $50 a month for a smartphone, $40 a month for an iPad or a similar device; if you travel, add $70 a month for some kind of wireless hotspot like <a href=\"http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/device/mobile-hotspot\">Verizon's Mi-Fi</a>. </p> <p>Competition drives down prices, and the world of cable and internet access has largely done away with the threat of competition. At home, if you don't like Time Warner's prices, you can't turn around and get Comcast; you'll have to spring for satellite service or hope Verizon FiOS serves your area. And once you have those, there's no guarantee they'll suit you or that their billing will be any better. </p> <p>The result is that Americans are being willingly pick-pocketed. Internet service is costly because internet providers refuse to compete with each other, ensuring they can charge high prices. They rationalize it like this: even though the cable companies have a gross profit margin of around 97% \u2013 meaning 97 cents of every dollar they make is pure profit \u2013 they still have to pay to service cell towers and invest in broadband. They have expensive equipment to maintain, see? That's not monopoly pricing power. That's just basic subsistence. </p> <p>Unfortunately, their arguments fail for two reasons: the first is that those companies are not actually investing in equipment as much as they would like you to think. There is a cable graveyard littered with \"overbuilders\" that tried to create fast, wide internet access networks to compete with the giant incumbents like Time Warner and Comcast. <a href=\"http://www.lightreading.com/fttx/google-fiber-has-a-shot-as-an-overbuilder/240154255\">Those overbuilders failed</a>.</p> <p>Another problem with the argument is that \"recovering fixed costs\" is not a problem; the cable companies' networks are already bought and paid for, many times over. The cable companies have such incredibly high profit margins \u2013 \"comically high\" in the words of one Sanford C Bernstein analyst \u2013 that they don't have any problem <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/02/20/say-it-with-me-now-data-caps-are-about-profits-not-recovering-fixed-costs/\">covering their costs</a>. The Open Technology Institute noted in <a href=\"http://www.newamerica.net/publications/policy/capped_internet_no_bargain_for_the_american_public\">a recent report</a>, \"cable companies invested over $185bn in capital expenditures between 1996 and 2011. But these networks generated close to $1tn in revenue in the same time period.\"</p> <p>The lack of either existent or upcoming competition taught the larger cable companies that it pays, literally, to get lazy and complacent: not only would they refuse to compete with each other, but there was also nothing to fear from any aggressive startups. </p> <p>The lack of any pressure to improve means Americans are forced to keep overpaying for internet service or give it up altogether. There are estimates that 100 million people in the US \u2013 or roughly a third of the population \u2013 do not have internet access at home. </p> <p>It's not unusual for middle-class families to spent more than $2,100 a year just to get online; poorer families can't even bother. The price of internet access has also risen faster than wages ever could; since 2006, the price of telephone and internet access has risen by 21%, according to the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323706704578227550932019178.html\">Wall Street Journal</a>. This is not something that single mothers and struggling families can afford; kids in urban neighborhoods cluster inside and around the local McDonald's to do their homework by grabbing a ride on <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324731304578189794161056954.html\">the stores' free Wi-Fi</a>. Imagine four years of doing that every night just to keep up with your peers, much less scoring the kind of grades that are good enough for college.</p> <p>Income inequality is also internet inequality. </p> <p>Americans can make do, of course. The irony of expensive internet service is that cheaper service is everywhere. Wi-Fi is widely available everywhere from most Starbucks to public libraries if you don't mind giving up your mobility; the prevalence of smartphones like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy require expensive data plans for internet access. And then, of course, people use the internet at work and can easily rationalize that 8 hours or more a day of access is quite enough. (Though that is no help to kids.)</p> <p>How did we get to this place? </p> <p>Susan Crawford, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York, has argued for years that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/opinion/how-to-get-high-speed-internet-to-all-americans.html\">cable companies are a monopoly</a>. One of her favorite statistics is that there's not much \"competition when 94% of new wired high-speed customers bought service from their local cable distributors\" at the end of 2012. In other words, cable companies are internet companies and they have locked down what looks like an oligopoly for their services. In an opinion piece in January, she summed up the problem:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"At the heart of the problem lie a few powerful [cable] companies with enormous influence over policy making. Both the wireless and wired markets for high-speed internet access have become heavily concentrated, and neither is subject to substantial competition nor oversight. Companies like Time Warner Cable routinely get their way when they seek to prevent local officials from encouraging competition. At the federal level, Verizon Wireless is keeping the FCC in court arguing over the scope of its regulatory powers \u2013 a move that has undermined the agency's authority. As a result, prices are too high and speeds too slow. A third of Americans opt not to buy high-speed internet access at home, often because they can't afford it.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Crawford's argument is that cable companies are not only monopolistic, but also exercise their considerable power in Washington to squeeze regulators. They walk like a monopoly and talk like a monopoly, trying to block rivals from getting a foothold. Even <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324539404578342342270674714.html\">local governments trying to improve local service</a> feel the lash.</p> <p>The idea of an oligopoly is a powerful one, which has tended to kick government regulators into gear to defend consumer interests. Naturally, there are those who believe the cable companies are not bad.</p> <p>\"About 89% of US residents have a choice of five or more broadband providers, counting mobile and satellite, and 85% have a choice of two or more wireline broadband providers,\" ComputerWorld summarized a recent <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9236725/U.S._broadband_service_is_competitive_with_other_nations_researcher_says\">Information Technology and Innovation Foundation report</a>. Of course, if you've ever had internet access in the US any time your life, the one thing you have not found is choice. Satellite service is an expensive and implausible option for many families. If you're like many Americans, you hit a point of frustration with your cable and internet provider and looked for alternatives \u2013 only to find none. </p> <p>There is, of course, no impetus in Washington to repair this. Market forces have only encouraged cable companies to keep raising prices with impunity. There is a strong argument to be made that cable companies have abused their pricing power and should submit to regulation in pricing \u2013 but there is likely no one in Washington ready to hear it. </p> <p>These are times when a person can yearn for the old moustache-twirling, chortling monopolies of the Gilded Age robber barons \u2013 the open maneuvering of a vindictive <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303\">John D Rockefeller, as detailed by Ron Chernow</a>, or an <a href=\"www.calvin.edu/henry/research/symposiumpapers/Symp09Flynn.pdf\">Andrew Mellon (pdf)</a> thundering with retro-Calvinist disdain for the moral weakness of the poor. It would be great to see monopolistic ambition with such clarity.</p> <p>Alas, in our day, we are left with the milquetoast version that rules our outrageously expensive cable, internet and phone services. These robber barons in rimless glasses and Rockports pick the pockets of recession-hit families as gleefully as any old Carnegie \u2013 but they need never fear government interference.</p>",

There are estimates that 100 million people in the US \u2013 or roughly a third of the population \u2013 do not have internet access at home. It's not unusual for middle-class families to spent more than $2,100 a year just to get online; poorer families can't even bother. The price of internet access has also risen faster than wages ever could; since 2006, the price of telephone and internet access has risen by 21%, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is not something that single mothers and struggling families can afford; kids in urban neighborhoods cluster inside and around the local McDonald's to do their homework by grabbing a ride on the stores' free Wi-Fi. Imagine four years of doing that every night just to keep up with your peers, much less scoring the kind of grades that are good enough for college. Income inequality is also internet inequality. Americans can make do, of course. The irony of expensive internet service is that cheaper service is everywhere. Wi-Fi is widely available everywhere from most Starbucks to public libraries if you don't mind giving up your mobility; the prevalence of smartphones like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy require expensive data plans for internet access. And then, of course, people use the internet at work and can easily rationalize that 8 hours or more a day of access is quite enough. (Though that is no help to kids.) How did we get to this place? Susan Crawford, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York, has argued for years that cable companies are a monopoly. One of her favorite statistics is that there's not much \"competition when 94% of new wired high-speed customers bought service from their local cable distributors\" at the end of 2012. In other words, cable companies are internet companies and they have locked down what looks like an oligopoly for their services. In an opinion piece in January, she summed up the problem: \"At the heart of the problem lie a few powerful [cable] companies with enormous influence over policy making. Both the wireless and wired markets for high-speed internet access have become heavily concentrated, and neither is subject to substantial competition nor oversight. Companies like Time Warner Cable routinely get their way when they seek to prevent local officials from encouraging competition. At the federal level, Verizon Wireless is keeping the FCC in court arguing over the scope of its regulatory powers \u2013 a move that has undermined the agency's authority. As a result, prices are too high and speeds too slow. A third of Americans opt not to buy high-speed internet access at home, often because they can't afford it.\" Crawford's argument is that cable companies are not only monopolistic, but also exercise their considerable power in Washington to squeeze regulators. They walk like a monopoly and talk like a monopoly, trying to block rivals from getting a foothold. Even local governments trying to improve local service feel the lash. The idea of an oligopoly is a powerful one, which has tended to kick government regulators into gear to defend consumer interests. Naturally, there are those who believe the cable companies are not bad. \"About 89% of US residents have a choice of five or more broadband providers, counting mobile and satellite, and 85% have a choice of two or more wireline broadband providers,\" ComputerWorld summarized a recent Information Technology and Innovation Foundation report. Of course, if you've ever had internet access in the US any time your life, the one thing you have not found is choice. Satellite service is an expensive and implausible option for many families. If you're like many Americans, you hit a point of frustration with your cable and internet provider and looked for alternatives \u2013 only to find none. There is, of course, no impetus in Washington to repair this. Market forces have only encouraged cable companies to keep raising prices with impunity. There is a strong argument to be made that cable companies have abused their pricing power and should submit to regulation in pricing \u2013 but there is likely no one in Washington ready to hear it. These are times when a person can yearn for the old moustache-twirling, chortling monopolies of the Gilded Age robber barons \u2013 the open maneuvering of a vindictive John D Rockefeller, as detailed by Ron Chernow, or an Andrew Mellon (pdf) thundering with retro-Calvinist disdain for the moral weakness of the poor. It would be great to see monopolistic ambition with such clarity. Alas, in our day, we are left with the milquetoast version that rules our outrageously expensive cable, internet and phone services. These robber barons in rimless glasses and Rockports pick the pockets of recession-hit families as gleefully as any old Carnegie \u2013 but they need never fear government interference.",

However, we do not see a full break up as likely and we see it as already more than factored in the valuation \u2013 we believe that the medical business is valued at around \u00a32.9bn in the current share price (i.e. 14-15 times earnings). Our sum of the parts valuation is at \u00a312.70 with the medical business valued at 12-13 times earnings. <br> </blockquote> <p>Building materials group <strong>Wolseley</strong> was the leading faller, down 212p to \u00a331.45. The company reported a 7.9% rise in third quarter trading profits to \u00a3150m, with good growth in the US and UK. But investors took more notice of Europe, where its business continues to suffer from the continuing economic crisis. Sales in France fell by 9.2% on a like for like basis due to weak residential construction, and by 4.6% in central Europe. Analyst Andy Brown at Panmure Gordon issued a sell note, saying:</p> <blockquote> Steady progress from Wolseley with a continuing good performance from the US being partially offset by tough conditions in Europe. Cost control and market share gains remain a feature, contributing to stable margins. While investors will focus on US housing we believe that there is a lot of good news already in the share price; take profit, sell. <br> The medium term attraction of North America remains in place so any price weakness will prompt us to revisit our recommendation. </blockquote> <p>Overall though the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 33.46 points higher at 6558.58, as markets took heart from talk that the US Federal Reserve was unlikely to end its bond buying programme in the immediate future.</p> <p><strong>GKN</strong> climbed 15.1p to 313.4p after UBS raised its target price from 275p to 350p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> The acquisitions of Getrag and Volvo Aero have transformed GKN's Driveline and Aerospace divisions and strengthened GKN's strategic position in both of its key markets \u2013 aerospace and autos \u2013 in our view. We believe those changes, together with GKN's continued focus on efficient cost and cash management, have put GKN in a better position strategically and operationally.. <br> The integration of acquisitions, the weakness in auto production in Europe, and the loss of a large aerospace contract have so far masked these changes. As we progress through 2013 and into 2014, we expect to see a gradual improvement in the performance of GKN's businesses that will reflect the transformation. </blockquote> <p>But <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> dipped 10.5p to \u00a333.43 as the pharmaceuticals group returned the rights to commercialise rheumatoid arthritis drug fostamatnib to US group Rigel, ending development of one of its few late-stage experimental treatments. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said:</p> <blockquote> This isn't a major surprise to us given managment's non-committal stance on their first quarter conference call, but it's a negative nonetheless given this was one of their potential blockbuster products only three months ago at their analyst day. Removal of this product from our model will see 4% downside to 2021 earnings per share and 3% to the discounted cash flow. <br> </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps, defence group <strong>Cobham</strong> closed 13.2p lower at 272.9p on talk of an institutional investor selling a stake of 3.6%, or 39.1m shares. The shares were said to be being offered by UBS to institutions at between 273.5p a share and Monday night's close of 286p.</p> <p>But <strong>Rentokil Initial</strong> rose 2.3p to 90.75p on reports of a possible offer for its office maintenance business.</p> <p>US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice is considering buying the Rentokil division and merging it with <strong>Balfour Beatty</strong>'s rival operation, according to the Financial Times.</p> <p>Talks are already being held on the plan, the report said, with a valuation of a higher than expected \u00a3400m put on the Rentokil business. Balfour finished 4.4p lower at 228.1p.</p> <p>Finally specialist electronics group <strong>Acal</strong> finished unchanged at 220p.</p> <p>Full year profits dipped from \u00a32.7m to \u00a32m excluding a \u00a35m loss after the sale of its UK parts business. But it increased its gross margin by 0.8 percentage points to 31% and gained market share in Europe, where chief executive Nick Jefferies is now seeing signs of recovery. It has raised its full year dividend by 6% to reflect the pickup in trading. Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> Europe is stabilising although it won't be a high growth area any time soon. The UK is definitely getting better but the US is most likely to recovery quickly. As long as there are no more big shocks, I think we are on a steady path to recovery. <br> </blockquote> <p>Acal also cut costs, including changing incentive schemes in Europe so that bonuses are not paid automatically but only when profits are improving.</p> <p>The figures do not include any contribution from the recent acquisition of French group Myrra for an initial \u20ac9.5m. Its first two months since its purchase in April have seen orders up 8% on last year, and Jefferies plans to move some of Acal's production currently done by sub-contractors in China into Myrra's plant in the country.</p> <p>Further acquisitions are likely, with the company looking at the US and Asia as well as Europe.</p> <p>Its new web platform was successfully launched in the UK and is being rolled out across Europe, although Google's indexing of the pages is taking longer than expected. Jefferies said:</p> <blockquote> Within a month of launching in the UK, we saw twice the volume on the UK site than in Europe. It is sending the right signals, we are building a brand. <br> </blockquote> <p>In a buy note Henry Carver at Peel Hunt said:</p> <blockquote> The finals were slightly ahead of expectations and current trading is starting to show signs of a pick-up in the electronics market. Whilst we remain cautious given the ongoing weakness in European macro, we are confident that this momentum will continue into 2014. <br> Acal is the only pan-European specialist supplier of niche electronic products and is in a strong position to consolidate and extend its leadership in that market via acquisitions and organic growth. With increased scale will come higher quality of earnings and improving margins. </blockquote>",

Analyst Andy Brown at Panmure Gordon issued a sell note, saying: Steady progress from Wolseley with a continuing good performance from the US being partially offset by tough conditions in Europe. Cost control and market share gains remain a feature, contributing to stable margins. While investors will focus on US housing we believe that there is a lot of good news already in the share price; take profit, sell. The medium term attraction of North America remains in place so any price weakness will prompt us to revisit our recommendation. Overall though the FTSE 100 finished 33.46 points higher at 6558.58, as markets took heart from talk that the US Federal Reserve was unlikely to end its bond buying programme in the immediate future. GKN climbed 15.1p to 313.4p after UBS raised its target price from 275p to 350p. The bank said: The acquisitions of Getrag and Volvo Aero have transformed GKN's Driveline and Aerospace divisions and strengthened GKN's strategic position in both of its key markets \u2013 aerospace and autos \u2013 in our view. We believe those changes, together with GKN's continued focus on efficient cost and cash management, have put GKN in a better position strategically and operationally.. The integration of acquisitions, the weakness in auto production in Europe, and the loss of a large aerospace contract have so far masked these changes. As we progress through 2013 and into 2014, we expect to see a gradual improvement in the performance of GKN's businesses that will reflect the transformation. But AstraZeneca dipped 10.5p to \u00a333.43 as the pharmaceuticals group returned the rights to commercialise rheumatoid arthritis drug fostamatnib to US group Rigel, ending development of one of its few late-stage experimental treatments. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said: This isn't a major surprise to us given managment's non-committal stance on their first quarter conference call, but it's a negative nonetheless given this was one of their potential blockbuster products only three months ago at their analyst day. Removal of this product from our model will see 4% downside to 2021 earnings per share and 3% to the discounted cash flow. Among the mid-caps, defence group Cobham closed 13.2p lower at 272.9p on talk of an institutional investor selling a stake of 3.6%, or 39.1m shares. The shares were said to be being offered by UBS to institutions at between 273.5p a share and Monday night's close of 286p. But Rentokil Initial rose 2.3p to 90.75p on reports of a possible offer for its office maintenance business. US private equity firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice is considering buying the Rentokil division and merging it with Balfour Beatty's rival operation, according to the Financial Times. Talks are already being held on the plan, the report said, with a valuation of a higher than expected \u00a3400m put on the Rentokil business. Balfour finished 4.4p lower at 228.1p. Finally specialist electronics group Acal finished unchanged at 220p. Full year profits dipped from \u00a32.7m to \u00a32m excluding a \u00a35m loss after the sale of its UK parts business. But it increased its gross margin by 0.8 percentage points to 31% and gained market share in Europe, where chief executive Nick Jefferies is now seeing signs of recovery. It has raised its full year dividend by 6% to reflect the pickup in trading. Jefferies said: Europe is stabilising although it won't be a high growth area any time soon. The UK is definitely getting better but the US is most likely to recovery quickly. As long as there are no more big shocks, I think we are on a steady path to recovery. Acal also cut costs, including changing incentive schemes in Europe so that bonuses are not paid automatically but only when profits are improving. The figures do not include any contribution from the recent acquisition of French group Myrra for an initial \u20ac9.5m. Its first two months since its purchase in April have seen orders up 8% on last year, and Jefferies plans to move some of Acal's production currently done by sub-contractors in China into Myrra's plant in the country. Further acquisitions are likely, with the company looking at the US and Asia as well as Europe. Its new web platform was successfully launched in the UK and is being rolled out across Europe, although Google's indexing of the pages is taking longer than expected. Jefferies said: Within a month of launching in the UK, we saw twice the volume on the UK site than in Europe. It is sending the right signals, we are building a brand. In a buy note Henry Carver at Peel Hunt said: The finals were slightly ahead of expectations and current trading is starting to show signs of a pick-up in the electronics market. Whilst we remain cautious given the ongoing weakness in European macro, we are confident that this momentum will continue into 2014. Acal is the only pan-European specialist supplier of niche electronic products and is in a strong position to consolidate and extend its leadership in that market via acquisitions and organic growth. With increased scale will come higher quality of earnings and improving margins.",

Sharp insisted this was not the case. Taylor, who quit as chief executive of Barclays in 1998, was questioned about his role as an adviser to Goldman Sachs until 2005. Asked about the Libor rigging, which forced out one of his successors, Bob Diamond, Taylor said there had been episodes of less bad rigging of the key rate. This was when low rates were submitted during the financial crisis, rather than when the rate was rigged to make profits for banks. \"Libor rates were invented. Putting a rate a little bit lower was a sensible thing to do. We need to keep in perspective how dangerous [a period] it was,\" said Taylor. \"I can't get excited about what seems to have been a help to financial stability.\" A former member of the Independent Commission on Banking, Taylor said he supported the drive by regulators to require banks to hold more capital. \"Bigger banks aren't going to lend until their capital positions have been repaired,\" he said. Sharp and Taylor insisted the regulator had not been soft on Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland by not forcing them to raise new capital from shareholders. Taylor said they were \"making violent changes to their business plans\".",

      "bodyText": "George Osborne's scheme to boost the housing market through state mortgage subsidies has been dubbed one of the \"most stupid economic ideas\" of the past 30 years by a leading City commentator. Albert Edwards, who heads the global strategy team at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said the chancellor's flagship Help to Buy programme was artificially inflating property prices and driving young people deeper into \"indentured servitude\". The chancellor said in the budget that the government would provide lenders with a guarantee of up to 20% of a mortgage in an attempt to provide potential buyers with a big enough deposit to purchase a home. If a borrower defaults on a loan, the taxpayer will be liable for a share of the losses. Edwards \u2013 a high profile City strategist renowned as a market doomsayer \u2013 said the scheme was artificially propping up the market and preventing prices correcting to affordable levels. First-time buyers need cheaper homes, not greater availably of debt to inflate house prices even further, Edwards said. \"This is madness.\" He added that house prices were still overvalued despite Britain being at the epicentre of the global credit crisis and remaining in the \"icy grip of private sector deleveraging\". In other countries, such as the US, house prices were now cheap. \"Young people today haven't got a chance of buying a house at a reasonable price, even with rock bottom interest rates. The Nationwide Building Society data shows that the average first-time buyer in London is paying over 50% of their take home pay in mortgage repayments \u2013 and that is when interest rates are close to zero.\" In a research note, Edwards said it made him \"genuinely really angry\" that burdening young people struggling to pay off student loans with more debt was seen as the solution to the problem of excessively expensive housing. \"Why are houses too expensive in the UK? Too much debt. So what is George Osborne's solution for first-time buyers unable to afford housing? Why, arrange for a government-guaranteed scheme to burden our young people with even more debt! Why don't we call this policy by the name it really is, namely the indentured servitude of our young people. \"I believe it truly is a moronic policy that stands head and shoulders above most of the stupid economic policies I have seen implemented during my 30 years in this business. It ranks above some of Alan Greenspan's very worst blunders.\"A number of experts have warned that Help to Buy will drive up house prices, pushing younger people out of the market. Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, has insisted the plan must remain temporary. He has expressed concern that the scheme \"is a little too close for comfort to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages. We had a very healthy mortgage market with competing lenders attracting borrowers before the crisis, and we need to get back to that healthy mortgage market.\"We do not want what the United States have, which is a government-guaranteed mortgage market, and they are desperately trying to find a way out of that position. \"So, we mustn't let this scheme turn into a permanent scheme \u2026 when is the right time to terminate it will depend on economic conditions at the time.\" The International Monetary Fund has also warned that the plan would fail to improve access to housing while the Treasury Select Committee and Office for Budget responsibility have warned it is likley to drive up house prices. Help to Buy: who said what Bank of England governor Mervyn King, 19 May \"This scheme is a little too close for comfort to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages. We had a very healthy mortgage market with competing lenders attracting borrowers before the crisis, and we need to get back to that healthy mortgage market. \"We do not want what the United States have, which is a government-guaranteed mortgage market, and they are desperately trying to find a way out of that position. \"So, we mustn't let this scheme turn into a permanent scheme. Now when is the right time to terminate it will depend on economic conditions at the time.\" International Monetary Fund, 22 May \"This measure may temporarily help boost confidence in the housing market, but there is a risk that, in the absence of an adequate supply response, the result would ultimately be mostly house price increases that would work against the aim of boosting access to housing.\" Treasury select committee, 20 April \"The government's Help to Buy scheme is very much a work in progress. It may have a number of unintended consequences \u2026 It is by no means clear that a scheme, whose primary outcome may be to support house prices, will ultimately be in the interests of first time buyers. This is the group the government says it wants to help.\" Stephen Nickell, Office for Budget Responsibility, 26 March \"The key is, is it just going to drive up house prices? By and large, in the short run the answer to that is yes. But in the medium term will the increased house prices stimulate more housebuilding, and our general answer to that would probably be 'a bit'. But the historical evidence suggests not very much.\" Alistair Darling, 25 March \"The irony is we are not prepared to build houses, but we are prepared to stoke the finance of a bubble in housing prices, and\u2026 That seems to me to be absolutely wrong.\" Simon Rubinsohn, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, 22 March \"The range of measures announced under the Help to Buy scheme to kickstart the housing market are much needed. Helping those who cannot afford large deposits by using the government's balance sheet to guarantee mortgages and using capital savings to offer shared equity loans on new-build for all buyers will help prevent prolonged market stagnation \u2026 However, government needs to be careful this doesn't create another housing bubble.\" Stewart Baseley, Home Builders Federation, 20 March \"A lack of affordable mortgage availability remains the biggest constraint on housing supply, something government now clearly understands and is looking to address \u2026 Building the homes the country desperately needs can be a key driver of economic activity. Government must be praised for its attempts to stimulate [housing market] activity, but must also be wary to get the details right.\"",

      "bodyText": "Angela Spindler, the incoming boss of the mail order group N Brown, will pick up a controversial \"golden hello\" worth an estimated \u00a31.63m when she joins the group in July, boosting her pay to almost \u00a34m over three years. N Brown, whose brands include Figleaves, High and Mighty and Viva La Diva, has agreed to reward its new chief executive with two \"one-off share awards\". The first, worth 100% of her salary, will be paid over two years and a further cache of shares worth 200% of her salary will be paid over three years \"subject to the achievement of strategic objectives\". N Brown declined to disclose Spindler's salary, saying this was not standard practice because she has not yet joined the company. Based on the \u00a3542,000 salary N Brown paid its retiring chief executive Alan White, Spindler's golden hello is likely to be worth around \u00a31.63m. On top of the golden hello and her salary, Spindler will also be eligible for a cash bonus worth 125% of her salary \u2013 an estimated \u00a3677,500 \u2013 at the end of her first year. This adds up to a total pay deal worth at least \u00a33.9m over three years. Golden hellos have become controversial in recent years because they are seen as rewarding chief executives for little more than taking a new post. Louise Rouse at the Share Action campaign group said such payments created a circular effect, where executives were compensated for leaving their companies. \"We regard this as bad practice,\" she said. \"When you are giving someone a bonus just for arriving, that is not related to long-term incentives on the performance of the company.\" In its annual report N Brown said it was making \"exceptional\" awards to compensate Spindler for losing out on shares at her current employer.

      "bodyText": "Europe's stock markets finished up, although not very dramatically, as traders eye up Friday's US jobs data (the non-farm payroll for May). As you'll see, though, shares are down slightly on Wall Street -- after twenty consecutive Tuesdays when the Dow Jones ended higher. And the euro is all but flat today, at \u20ac1.3068. Here's Kit Juckes of Soc Gen's take on the markets: The story of Monday was that bad US data were good for equities, bad for the dollar, calming for a world woried of Fed normalisation. We will see Fed 'taper fear' ebb and flow all summer. This morning we saw the RBA leave rates on hold but suggest they will ease further, and sound bearish of their currency, whose short-covering rally was small and is over. And in Japan, stronger wage growth is just good news for Abenomics and Japan. I's a low volume, quiet day. Treasury yields and equities are flat and the dollar up a bit. I think we can mark time till payrolls, but I think rallies in Treasuries will find willing sellers and the reaction to 'good NFP' would be bigger than to 'bad NFP'. The Taper-debate rumbles but it's a question of when, not if poliicy gets less easy. That's probably the lesson from recent 'mixed' data; I meet plenty of people who think any talk of US rate normalisation is premature, but nearly all concede 'new normal neutral' is much higher than here. That's a recipe for a bearish Tsy, bullish USD, cautious credit bias and also for higher vol. Europe is basking in the soft glow of yesterday's slightly better data. Euro bears are once again weary. The news that the pace of decline in economic activity is slowing, is hardly reason to break out the champagne, and all we can really look forward to is more incremental easing from the ECB. That reminds me that Helianthe, Hoth25, zerozero and nocolours had a good banter this morning over the issue of whether bad data is good for the markets -- read it here. And with that, I'm off. Cheers all, back tomorrow. Thanks for reading, and for the comments. GW Troika officials were reminded of the public unhappiness over Greece's economic situation as they began their latest assessment of the country's economy. A group of retired seamen held a demonstration in front of their healthcare fund building in Piraeus, to protest against benefit cuts, as these two photos show: Seperately, a survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Center found that 99% of Greeks believe the country\u2019s economic situation is very or somewhat bad. Two-thirds think their generation will experience an easier time than the next one. However, as Kathimerini reports, other countries are more pessimistic: When asked about how they see their children's futures, 67% said they expect the next generation to be worse off than their parents, coming fifth on the scale behind Japan, Britain and Italy. This scale is topped by France, where 90% saw a bleak future for the next generation. Former Goldman Sachs executive Fabrice Tourre has failed in an attempt to have elements of a fraud case over the controversial Abacus case thrown out. A US district judge rejected Tourre's argument that the case against him should be 'narrowed' because he was working outside the US for Goldman during the time covered by the SEC's case. Katherine Forrest ruled that the SEC was due to 'partial summary judgement'. The civil fraud trial will begin in mid-July, Reuters reports. Abacus was a CDO (collateralised debt obligation), or mortgage-backed security, which Goldman created and sold to clients.\"Fabulous Fab\" Tourre hit the headlines when he faced a congressional commitee after the SEC sued Goldman (details here). Amid signs of some economic revival in the UK, Duncan Weldon of the TUC has drawn up 10 questions \u2013 asking how the country could build a truly sustainable recovery: He's looking for answers on his blog. Here are the questions: How can we ensure that the rewards from growth actually benefit most people? The danger here is a repeat of the situation between 2003-2008, when despite decent headline growth, median wages for those in the middle and below barely budged. How can we reduce our dependence on the financial sector as a driver of growth? How can we ensure that there is more economic activity throughout the UK rather than too much being concentrated in the South East pocket? How can we increase investment levels in the UK? In particular, how can we increase private business investment? What can be done about the UK\u2019s poor balance of payments? How can we ensure that we have a diverse and resilient tax base? How can we better manage the credit cycle? How do we tackle long term unemployment and ensure that more people have access to the labour market? In other words, how do we get back to something reassembling full employment? Why is youth unemployment so high? What is a proper balance between fiscal, monetary and macroprudential policy and how should that balance be managed? Those of you based abroad may have particularly useful insights. No need to answer all 10 questions, I imagine. Just click here... On the EC-China solar panels dispute (3pm onwards), our Europe editor Ian Traynor reports that the Commissions says the dispute is less about dumping than fundamentally scrutinising China's trade practices and its commercial relations with Europe. This means there is a lot at stake, Ian explains: De Gucht argues that the big danger facing Europe is that it will fail to stand up to China unless it stands together. But Germany, by far China's biggest trading partner in the EU, is fiercely opposed to the imposition of tarriffs. Only last week Chancellor Angela Merkel said that this was not the way to resolve the dispute. It is very rare indeed for the Commission to launch such a major trade dispute, the biggest ever, against the wishes of the EU's biggest exporter. The full text of the EC's announcement on new duties for Chinese solar panel makers (see 3pm) are online here: Remarks by EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht on the decision to impose provisional anti-dumping measures on imports of solar panels from China Here's De Gucht's conclusion: Let me end by once again stressing that I would prefer a negotiated solution and quickly \u2013 there is no reason for this to last months if there is a sincere desire by our Chinese partners to seek a solution through 'price-undertakings.' But it is the role of Chinese exporters and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to now step forward with a solution that removes the injury to the European solar panel industry. I look forward to engaging with them as soon as possible so we can work together to reach a satisfactory settlement which will be beneficial for all of us. Despite EU politicians asking it not to provoke a trade war with China, the European Commission has annnounced new 'anti-dumping' duties on solar panel makers. In the last few minutes the EU trade chief, Karel De Gucht, announced that the Chinese solar panel industry will face a 11.8% levy on imports into the EU. That's a lower rate than some had expected. However, it will jump to 47.6% unless the two sides can reach a new deal by August \u2013 suggesting concessions have been made in an attempt to get China to the negotiating table. De Gucht told a press conference in Brussels that the ball was in China's court now. He is adamant that Chinese firms have been unfairly driving EU competitors out of business by dumping unfairly subsidised products on the European market. Some European leaders, though, had urged the EC to hold back from imposing levies. Led by Germany, they feared retaliatory action at a time when the eurozone needs to boost its trade links to escape recession, and is looking for investment from China. There is an irony in Brussels opening hostilities with Beijing hours after Christine Lagarde urges Greece to find more foreign investment (see 12.23pm). France, though, has supported imposing new duties on China \u2013 making it harder for the Commission to avoid today's announcement. And De Gucht insists that Chinese solar panels are unfairly cheap. De Gucht also denied caving into pressure from some member states to impose a low levy for the first few weeks -- although the initial level of 11.8% does look like a concession: Over in America, the trade deficit has widened as a rise in imports outpaced exports in April. The US trade gap hit $40.29bn on a seasonally adjusted basis, following a 2.4% rise in exports to $227.7bn and a 1.2% rise in imports to $187.4bn. That's an increase on March's $37.13bn, but a slightly smaller rise than expected. The data also included import and export data by region. It's not seasonally adjusted, and showed some sharp swings: EXPORTS BY COUNTRY/REGION, UNADJUSTED Canada: +0.6% Mexico: +10.7% EU: -7.9% China: -4.7% Japan: -9.3% South/Central America: -8.6% Brazil: -9.4% OPEC: -15.5% IMPORTS BY COUNTRY/REGION, UNADJUSTED Canada: +1.0% Mexico: +4.7% EU: +2.2% China: +21.2% Japan: -1.1% South/Central America: +1.8% Brazil: +8.4% OPEC: + 6.7 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 However, Spring data can be particularly volatile due to holidays (such as Easter, and China's Spring Festival) which disrupt the usual patterns of trade. Marc Ostwald of Monument Securities said the data suggested weakness in April due to weak exports to EU and China, adding: But treat all of this with care, seasonals and revisions suggest extrapolating to underlying trends would be premature! Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the social democrat's challenger to Angela Merkel in this autumn's elections, has called for a new Marshall Plan for Europe, to help its weakest members return to growth. The SPD's Chancellor candidate told the Free University of Berlin in Berlin that the package would help countries which have been racked by austerity measures since the financial crisis began. There's a hitch, though. The plan would be financed, Steinbr\u00fcck suggsted, by financial transactions \u2013 something Europe appears to be inching away from. Here's AP's take: The man who is challenging Angela Merkel to become chancellor of Germany has called for a new Marshall Plan to revive Europe\u2019s ailing economies. Peer Steinbrueck said in his first major foreign policy speech Tuesday at Berlin\u2019s Free University that such a program could be funded in part by new taxes on financial transactions. He added that the government\u2019s insistence on budget austerity in Europe is creating economic stagnation. Steinbrueck\u2019s Social Democratic Party is trailing Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats in the polls three months before the Sept. 22 general election. The former finance minister said countries like Greece and Portugal need a massive plan similar to the one that rebuilt Germany after World War II to avoid a \u201cdiabolical spiral\u201d toward further joblessness and economic stagnation. However, it appears that the German government has been working on another issue today. According to Bloomberg, Berlin has won Paris's backing to delay giving the European Stability Mechanism full powers to recapitalise banks, possibly until 2015. Christine Lagarde has repeated her call for Greece's government to push on with economic reforms to encourage foreign investors, and to keep fighting tax evasion, as inspectors from the Troika arrive back in Athens for (yet) another assessment of its economy. Speaking to state TV, IMF chief Lagarde argued that Greece was 'pretty much on track', although some way from the end. Athens mustn't stop, she argued. Asked if she agrees that Greece is becoming a \"success story\" (as prime minister Samaras claimed), Lagarde wasn't completely convinced, saying: I certainly hope it's on its way to being a success story. She added: There are some really positive developments but obviously more needs to be done. There has been significant improvement with a programme that is now pretty much on track. The programme has seen massive, unprecedented consolidation, which is hard. That 'effort' is clear in the latest jobless data, with a quarter of people officially unemployed (or 60%-plus for young people). That's why the IMF is pushing for foreign investment -- consumer spending is hardly going to drive a recovery (although exports could help, if economic growth elsewhere picks up). Last week's jump in Greek economic confidence is an encouraging sign for the Troika, whose visit has begun by highlighting the issue of job cuts across the public sector. Athens has agreed to cut 15,000 civil servants by the end of 2014, but is pushing for more time. Kathimerini has more details: Although Athens is committed to the agreed target of sacking 4,000 public sector workers by the end of the year, it wants to avoid stirring up union opposition during what is expected to be a prosperous summer for the tourism sector. Today, the Administrative Reform Ministry will have to hand over to the troika details of the process to sack civil servants accused and then convicted of offenses such as breach of faith, accepting bribes and taking leave without permission. It is estimated that hundreds of these public servants will be among the 15,000 that have to be fired by next year. Meanwhile, our economics leader writer, Aditya Chakrabortty, has dsismissed the talk of Greece's 'success story' as premature, and self-serving: What's at stake here is a much bigger prize than whether an economy worth 2% of Europe's annual GDP really is on the mend. It's about justifying the shock therapy imposed on distressed members of the eurozone. Building materials firm Wolseley isn't joining today's market rally. It's shares are down almost 4% this morning, with construction delays in France overshadowing improvements in the UK and US. The firm (whose products include plumbing and heating kit) warned that market conditions remain challenging in the rest of Europe. As my colleague Nick Fletcher explains: The company reported a 7.9% rise in third quarter trading profits to \u00a3150m, with good growth in the US and UK. But investors took more notice of Europe, where its business continues to suffer from the continuing economic crisis. Sales in France fell by 9.2% on a like for like basis due to weak residential construction, and by 4.6% in central Europe. More details and reaction here: Confirmation this morning that while the eurozone has many problems, inflation isn't one of them. Factory gate prices \u2013 basically, what companies pay for their raw materials and components \u2013 fell by 0.6% in April, the biggest month-on-month decrease since July 2009 Energy prices in the euro zone dropped by 1.6 percent in April from March - the biggest decline since July 2009 - and making for a fall of 2.0 percent compared to the same month a year ago. Producer proces fell across the eurozone's biggest countries. Reuters has the details: Producer prices fell in all core euro zone countries measured on the monthly basis, with Germany showing a 0.2 percent decline, the third monthly fall in a row, and France recording a 0.9 percent drop. No reason here for the European Central Bank to worry about inflationary pressures at this week's governing council meeting.... UPDATE: Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight agrees: The ECB\u2019s main focus will remain on ways of facilitating getting more credit through to smaller companies. The ECB continues to look closely into the case for a negative deposit rate, although we are doubtful that it will go down this route. And this graph shows how UK housebuilding activity outpaced the commercial and civil engineering sectors last month (see 10.14am): Britain's construction sector returned to growth after six months of contraction in May, but new homes \u2013 rather than infrastructure projects \u2013 was the cause. Markit reported a \"robust and accelerated\" expansion of residential housebuilding in Britain. Its UK construction PMI (a survey of conditions across the sector) rose to 50.8 in May, indicating a rise in activity, from April's 49.4, a small fall. Residential housebuilding activity hit a 26-month high. However, spenging on commercial and civil engineering actually declined again, despite the UK economy returning to growth this year. That, Markit warned, was a drag on growth. David Noble, chief executive officer at the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, said the figures showed the impact of the UK government's efforts to stimulate the housing sector (such as its much-criticised Help to Buy scheme), and the urgent need for more larger infrastructure schemes. Noble said: The construction sector seems to have turned a corner after six dismal months. The improvement has been fuelled by a boon in house building, but the sector remains bogged down by contractions in commercial construction and civil engineering. Whilst confidence for the year ahead remains high, the poor performance of suppliers and flat levels of employment will serve as a reality check to construction and the wider UK economy. The Government\u2019s attempts to boost house building has given months of lacklustre growth a shot in the arm, but the continued decline in civil engineering can be largely attributed to the lack of public sector projects, which show no sign of increasing. This, coupled with poor performance in the commercial sector, means house building alone is driving industry growth. Here's the release. Many experts have warned that Help to Buy will drive up house prices, pricing younger people out of the market. Sir Mervyn King, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, has insisted the plan must remain temporary. And last month the International Monetary Fund waded in, warning that the plan would fail to improve access to housing. The warning came as the IMF also called for infrastructure projects to be accelerated to help the economy. Financial blogger @pawelmorski was so alarmed by Help to Buy that he suggested last week that Osborne must be a Communist mole: UK: Agent Gideon Goes Rogue. And Societe Generale's analyst, Albert Edwards, has also laid into Osborne for burdening young people with even more debt. Why don't we call this policy by the name it really is, namely the indentured servitude of our young people? Overnight, Australia's central bank surprised few people by leaving interest rates unchanged (at 2.75%). The Reserve Bank of Australia took the decision to sit tight after concluding that there were \"reasonable prospects of a pick-up\" in global economic growth in 2014. Last month that RBA made an unexpected rate cut. But as governor Glenn Stevens explained: The Board judged that the easier financial conditions now in place will contribute to a strengthening of growth over time, consistent with achieving the inflation target. It decided that the stance of monetary policy remained appropriate for the time being. The Board also judged that the inflation outlook, as currently assessed, may provide some scope for further easing, should that be required to support demand. The RBA also commented that the Australian dollar has fallen in value in recent weeks, but still remains high by historical terms -- showing they aren't ignoring the impact of currency fluctuations. Here's the full statement Obviously the RBA hasn't been forced into the kind of electronic money-printing that alarms the likes of BIS. But that final sentence shows that the RBA is still thinking about relaxing monetary policy, not tightening. Janu Chan, economist at ST George's Bank, said the door had been left open to another rate cut: Given the uncertainty surrounding the labour force, business investment and the path of the Australian dollar, there is that possibility that they might cut rates again. Especially if the RBA's assessment of the global economy proves too bullish, amid concern over China's growth prospects. As Fast FT asked this morning, is Australia's central bank too optimistic? City analysts confirm that we're in a topsy turvy world where bad economic news is good for share prices -- thus today's little rally after yesterday's weak US manufacturing data (see 8.57am). Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, explained that London share prices had been \"helped by - wait for it \u2013 poor US data, reducing recently heightened fears the US Fed could taper its QE3 asset purchase programme soon\". Matt Basi of CMC Markets makes the same point in his morning note: The possibility that Federal Reserve quantitative easing will continue at full throttle for some time to come has been the key driver for world markets over the past day. Ironically, a much weaker than expected ISM manufacturing index in the US led to a stock market rally. Markets reasoned that although the manufacturing sector accounts for only 10-12% of US GDP, an ISM reading of 49.0 (the weakest since 2009) would see Fed stimulus left in place. Yesterday morning was dominated by better-than-expected manufacturing data from Europe, which had no obvious effect on stock prices at all... European investors have shaken off the prospect of the end to electronic money-printing, pushing shares higher this morning. BIS chief Jaime Caruana's warning that unwinding the world's huge quantitative easing programmes may not be smooth (see 8.12am) hasn't caused alarm. Instead, traders are anticipating that the Federal Reserve will maintain its stimulus programmes. Yesterday's weak ISM manufacturing survey, which suggested the US recovery was faltering, is being taken as a sign that Ben Bernanke won't start tightening.... There's also relief that Japan's Nikkei climbed by 2% overnight, reversing some of its recent heavy falls. \u2022 FTSE 100: up 38 points at 6564, +0.6% \u2022 German DAX: up 67 at 8353, +0.8% \u2022 French CAC: up 26 points at 3927, +0.7% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: up 82 points at 8367, +1% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: up 199 points at 17257, +1.1% Just in, the number of people out of work in Spain fell by almost 100,000 last month. Data released by the Spanish Labour Ministry showed the biggest ever fall in registered jobless for any May. Registered unemployment dropped by 98,265 people, or 1.97%, lowering the total out of work to 4,890,928. May is typically a good month for employment, with the start of the tourism season meaning more temporary hiring (this data isn't seasonally adjusted). But still, the size of the bounceback is a welcome surprise. In an average May, unemployment drops by around 55k. The figures showed that unemployment fell across the economy, and for both men (-2.4%) and women (-1.47%). Most encouraging, youth unemployment fell by 16,735 people (-3.53%) from the previous month. Spain's secretary of state for employment, Engracia Hidalgo, welcomed the news, and said the Madrid government was committed to delivering a strong economic recovery. Here's the full statement: El paro registrado ha bajado en 98.265 personas, el mayor descenso en un mes de mayo. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest events across the eurozone and the global economy. First up... the world's financial markets could face stormy conditions when central banks begin to tighten monetary policy, the head of the Bank of International Settlements has warned this morning. BIS chief Jaime Caruana said investors and governments need to be ready for rough times. Speaking in Seoul this morning, the general manager of the so-called \"central bankers\u2019 bank\" warned: While central banks surely have all the tools necessary to technically engineer an exit and will doubtless do their utmost to communicate properly with market participants, it cannot be taken for granted that the process will be smooth. Many financial institutions, he warned, could suffer significant losses when central banks decide to return to normality and end their government bond purchase schemes. As Caruana put it: Authorities and market participants must recognise the challenges inherent in the inevitable and desirable interest rate normalisation and seek to make their financial firms and markets resilient in the face of potential strains. The speech comes at a time when the world markets are being heavily influenced by speculation over America's stimulus package. Talk of the Federal Reserve 'tapering' its huge quantitative easing programme this summer have driven shares down, while bad economic news has often pushed shares up because further stimulus has looked more likely. Caruana is worried that those QE packages have driven bond prices up to unsustainable levels where investors don't actualiy get a return for holding the debt. As he puts it: The term premium \u2013 the extra reward for bearing the price risk and inflation risk of holding a fixed rate bond \u2013 has flipped into a penalty that the investor must pay. This graph shows that holding US and German 10-year debt means a guaranteed loss, once inflation is factored in: Once QE is unwound, those yields will rise as prices fall -- and the impact on banks could be painful, Caruana warned: A global steepening of yield curves could hit the capital of financial institutions, to the extent that they hold their government\u2019s debt, and worsen debt sustainability. Caruana's speech is online here: Global liquidity: where do we stand? (including plenty of other graphs). It's the latest in a series of warnings from BIS over the era of ultra-loose monetary policy. Last month, the global banking body suggested that QE had gone far enough. As usual, I'll be tracking the latest events through the day....",

We will see Fed 'taper fear' ebb and flow all summer. This morning we saw the RBA leave rates on hold but suggest they will ease further, and sound bearish of their currency, whose short-covering rally was small and is over. And in Japan, stronger wage growth is just good news for Abenomics and Japan.</p> <p>I's a low volume, quiet day. Treasury yields and equities are flat and the dollar up a bit. I think we can mark time till payrolls, but I think rallies in Treasuries will find willing sellers and the reaction to 'good NFP' would be bigger than to 'bad NFP'. The Taper-debate rumbles but it's a question of when, not if poliicy gets less easy. That's probably the lesson from recent 'mixed' data; I meet plenty of people who think any talk of US rate normalisation is premature, but nearly all concede 'new normal neutral' is much higher than here. That's a recipe for a bearish Tsy, bullish USD, cautious credit bias and also for higher vol.</p> <p>Europe is basking in the soft glow of yesterday's slightly better data. Euro bears are once again weary. The news that the pace of decline in economic activity is slowing, is hardly reason to break out the champagne, and all we can really look forward to is more incremental easing from the ECB.</p> </blockquote> <p>That reminds me that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/4340248\">Helianthe,</a> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/2513795\">Hoth25, zerozero</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/user/id/4125144\">nocolours</a> had a good banter this morning over the issue of whether bad data is good for the markets --&#xa0;<a href=\"http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/24053733\">read it here</a>.</p> <p>And with that, I'm off.

That's why the IMF is pushing for foreign investment -- consumer spending is hardly going to drive a recovery (<em>although exports could help, if economic growth elsewhere picks up</em>).</p> <p>Last week's jump in Greek economic confidence is an encouraging sign for the Troika, whose visit has begun by highlighting the issue of job cuts across the public sector. Athens has agreed to cut 15,000 civil servants by the end of 2014, but is pushing for more time.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_03/06/2013_502362\">Kathimerini has more details</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Although Athens is committed to the agreed target of sacking 4,000 public sector workers by the end of the year, it wants to avoid stirring up union opposition during what is expected to be a prosperous summer for the tourism sector.</p> <p>Today, the Administrative Reform Ministry will have to hand over to the troika details of the process to sack civil servants accused and then convicted of offenses such as breach of faith, accepting bribes and taking leave without permission.

Speaking in&#xa0;Seoul this morning, the general manager of the so-called \"central bankers\u2019 bank\" warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While central banks surely have all the tools necessary to technically engineer an exit and will doubtless do their utmost to communicate properly with market participants, it cannot be taken for granted that the process will be smooth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Many financial institutions, he warned, could suffer significant losses when central banks decide to return to normality and end their government bond purchase schemes. As <strong>Caruana</strong> put it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Authorities and market participants must recognise the challenges inherent in the inevitable and desirable interest rate normalisation and seek to make their financial firms and markets resilient in the face of potential strains.</p> </blockquote> <p>The speech comes at a time when the world markets are being heavily influenced by speculation over America's stimulus package. Talk of the Federal Reserve 'tapering' its huge quantitative easing programme this summer have driven shares down, while bad economic news has often pushed shares up because further stimulus has looked more likely.</p> <p><strong>Caruana</strong> is worried that those QE packages have driven bond prices up to unsustainable levels where investors don't actualiy get a return for holding the debt. As he puts it:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The term premium \u2013 the extra reward for bearing the price risk and inflation risk of holding a fixed rate bond \u2013 has flipped into a penalty that the investor must pay.</p> </blockquote> <p>This graph shows that holding US and German 10-year debt means a guaranteed loss, once inflation is factored in:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-050b01b5-f8d9-4e67-8324-7b9724a2e82d\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/6/4/1370328875327/dad06c51-9ab3-4a83-93f2-6034fcace650-460x243.png\" alt=\"10-year bond yields of US and Germany\" width=\"460\" height=\"243\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: BIS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once QE is unwound, those yields will rise as prices fall -- and the impact on banks could be painful, Caruana warned:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A global steepening of yield curves could hit the capital of financial institutions, to the extent that they hold their government\u2019s debt, and worsen debt sustainability.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><strong>Caruana's&#xa0;</strong></strong>speech is online here: <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/speeches/sp130604.htm\">Global liquidity: where do we stand?</a> (including plenty of other graphs).</p> <p>It's the latest in a series of warnings from BIS over the era of ultra-loose monetary policy.

      "bodyText": "George Osborne's hopes of a rapid privatisation of Royal Bank of Scotland could be scuppered by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which is next week expected to discuss whether the bailed-out bank should be nationalised and split into a good and bad bank. The future of RBS was not originally within the remit of the commission, chaired by Tory MP Andrew Tyrie and set up after the Libor scandal. It has been thrust onto the agenda by Tory peer Lord Lawson, who has questioned the chancellor on whether RBS should be broken up. Outgoing Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King also told the commission he believed the 81% taxpayer-owned bank should be split in two, with the state keeping the \"bad\" bank. The \"good\" bank, created to lend to business, could then be privatised. King is understood to have privately told RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton that he is committed to arguing for a break-up before his term of office ends at the end of June. An early 600-page draft of the commission report is circulating among members, including the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby as well as Lawson. They have until Friday to table amendments before beginning next week's two-day session to produce the much anticipated final version. Members appear to be divided on whether to reopen the debate about the future structure of RBS in their final report, expected to be published days before Osborne delivers his Mansion House speech to the City on 19 June. Osborne is expected to use the high-profile speech to outline a plan for returning RBS, and the 39% taxpayer-owned Lloyds Banking Group to the private sector following pressure from the International Monetary Fund to devise a \"clear strategy\" for the two bailed out banks. There were suggestions that the commission could call on Osborne to consider all options and devise a strategy by September. Even the most subtle of references to RBS will present Osborne with a dilemma as he attempts to engineer a pre-election sale of the bank. He has been asked by the Treasury select committee \u2013 also chaired by Tyrie \u2013 for a report on the cost of breaking up RBS. The Treasury is yet to reply to that request. During his evidence to the commission in February, Osborne said it could cost up to \u00a310bn to nationalise and then break up RBS and that there were \"very considerable obstacles\" to doing so. On Tuesday a Treasury spokesman said: \"As the chancellor has said, we need functioning banks supporting the real economy instead of nursing their wounds, and we will set out the way ahead once the parliamentary banking commission has completed its work.\" The banking commission declined to comment. According to the BBC, which has reported that the commission is committed to recommending a break-up of RBS, one idea the government is exploring is to transfer RBS's Ulster Bank to the Irish government via Ireland's bad bank, the National Asset Management Agency. Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, has questioned whether more taxpayer cash should be poured in to the bank \u2013 on top of the \u00a345bn used to buy shares \u2013 to strip it of toxic assets. At the bank's recent results, he said: \"Clearly, if government, for one reason or another, thought that it was a good use of public money to take some headaches off us, why would we complain about that or why would we refuse to consider it?\" But he added: \"Of course, there's a separate debate about whether more public money in RBS's direction is necessary or a good thing.\" Some ideas on the future of RBS are expected to be contained in a document due to published this month by the Policy Exchange thinktank which may also frame Osborne's thinking. At a hearing of the Treasury select committee on Tuesday Richard Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs banker who is joining the Bank of England's financial policy committee, appeared to back the idea of a breakup of RBS. The Treasury select committee is expected to hold a new hearing with Lloyds executives about the failure to sell 632 branches to the Co-operative Bank. The Co-op is working on ways to plug a \u00a31bn capital shortfall at the bank.",

The Treasury is yet to reply to that request.</p> <p>During <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/25/osborne-full-nationalisation-rbs-banking-standards-commission\" title=\"\">his evidence to the commission</a> in February, Osborne said it could cost up to \u00a310bn to nationalise and then break up RBS and that there were \"very considerable obstacles\" to doing so.</p> <p>On Tuesday a Treasury spokesman said: \"As the chancellor has said, we need functioning banks supporting the real economy instead of nursing their wounds, and we will set out the way ahead once the parliamentary banking commission has completed its work.\" The banking commission declined to comment.</p> <p>According to the BBC, which has reported that the commission is committed to recommending a break-up of RBS, one idea the government is exploring is to transfer RBS's Ulster Bank to the Irish government via Ireland's bad bank, the National Asset Management Agency.</p> <p>Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, has questioned whether more taxpayer cash should be poured in to the bank \u2013 on top of the \u00a345bn used to buy shares \u2013 to strip it of toxic assets. At the bank's recent results, he said: \"Clearly, if government, for one reason or another, thought that it was a good use of public money to take some headaches off us, why would we complain about that or why would we refuse to consider it?\" But he added: \"Of course, there's a separate debate about whether more public money in RBS's direction is necessary or a good thing.\"</p> <p>Some ideas on the future of RBS are expected to be contained in a document due to published this month by the Policy Exchange thinktank which may also frame Osborne's thinking.</p> <p>At a hearing of the Treasury select committee on Tuesday Richard Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs banker who is joining the Bank of England's financial policy committee, appeared to back the idea of a breakup of RBS. The Treasury select committee is expected to hold a new hearing with Lloyds executives about the failure to sell 632 branches to the Co-operative Bank. The Co-op is working on ways to plug a \u00a31bn capital shortfall at the bank.</p>",

But investors took more notice of Europe, where its business continues to suffer from the continuing economic crisis.

      "bodyText": "Embattled surfwear chain Billabong saw half its value wiped out after the company announced an end to long-running takeover talks. The Australian group said two private equity firms, Altamont Capital and Sycamore, had abandoned plans for a full takeover and were now looking at a deal designed to help pay back its debt. Billabong chairman Ian Pollard said: \"The refinancing is intended to provide the company with a comprehensive solution and an appropriate capital structure, allowing it to continue its reform agenda. It's our intention to conclude these discussions as soon as possible while aggressively reducing costs across all of our global operations.\" Billabong has been buffeted by a strong Australian dollar, which has dented overseas profits, while debts used to fund its international expansion have weighed on the company. Core Billabong brands, which include its namesake and Von Zipper, also appear to have lost touch with the group's core youth market. The company \u2013 which has been dealing with takeover approaches for more than a year \u2013 has pledged to cull brands and close underperforming stores. The shares took a nosedive after they resumed trading on Tuesday, plunging 41% to A$0.26 \u2013 leaving the company worth just A$130m (\u00a386m). Sycamore \u2013 which had teamed up with the former head of Billabong's US business \u2013 offered A$0.60 cents a share, or A$287m, for the company in April. But reports suggest the firm walked away after its banks asked for more information on the quality of Billabong's earnings. On Tuesday, Billabong ripped up its full-year guidance for the fourth time since December 2012, saying earnings were likely to be 13% lower than forecasts it made in February. The company now expects full-year pre-tax profits before exceptional items of between $67m and $74m. Billabong said it was still looking to sell 70-strong Canadian chain West 49, which it bought just three years ago for $91m, as part of an ill-fated push into the country. Reports suggest parties other than Sycamore and Altamont are also interested in the business. The proceeds of the refinancing and asset sales would be used to repay Billabong's $279m debt pile, but analysts remained unconvinced. Jordan Rogers of Commonwealth Bank of Australia said: \"Billabong's balance sheet is again in a fragile position. We don't view the private equity firms as reliable debt providers.\"",
