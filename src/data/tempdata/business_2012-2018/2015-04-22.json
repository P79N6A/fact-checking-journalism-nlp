Almost two-thirds of firms told a survey by trade body RICS that labour shortages were a serious issue as they looked ahead to what most said would be another strong year for the construction industry. The warning comes after more than two years during which the domestic housing market has recovered some of its previous swagger, while the commercial building and infrastructure industries have remained in the doldrums. But a rebound in spending on infrastructure and commercial construction in recent months has added to the industry\u2019s more positive outlook. This year, growth is expected to reach 3.8%. RICS said progress was being held back by \u201ca degree of uncertainty that has entered the market in the countdown to the general election\u201d, but the biggest factor holding back growth was a lack of skilled engineers, project managers and other specialists. RICS spokesman Alan Muse said: \u201cDespite the outward optimism, there are some very real unknowns which are impacting on industry, including the general election, the UK\u2019s relationship with Europe and skills shortages. Muse said more than half of firms reported difficulties obtaining a bank loan or other form of finance, hindering their investment plans, especially small-to-medium-sized businesses. \u201cNow that material shortages are becoming less of an issue, the practical challenges are in providing the skilled labour the industry needs and in alleviating the financial constraints, which saw nine months of decreased lending in 2014.\u201d But outward confidence for growth is strong, with 79% of respondents expecting their workloads to rise over the next 12 months.

Lobban, who left the government communications headquarters last October, joins a committee that already includes a former president of Interpol, Khoo Boon Hui; a former assistant to the US president for homeland security and counterterrorism, Frances Townsend; and the former head of the interbank payments system Swift, Lazaro Campos. Lobban ran GCHQ during a period when the intelligence agency came under intense pressure following the Edward Snowden revelations. Snowden leaked documents detailing the mass surveillance operations of intelligence agencies that involved the wholesale collection of personal data. Standard Chartered highlighted the role Lobban had played in tackling cybersecurity, his attendance at weekly national security council meetings and former membership of the joint intelligence committee. The bank created its risk committee after a $670m (\u00a3445m) fine in 2012 for breaching US sanctions on Iran, for which the bank remains under scrutiny by regulators. In December, a two-year deferred prosecution imposed at the time of the fine was extended for three years to allow investigations to continue. The bank\u2019s financial performance has also waned \u2013 three profit warnings were issued in 12 months \u2013 and the longstanding chief executive, Peter Sands, will leave in June. Sands is being replaced by the investment banker Bill Winters, and the chairman, Sir John Peace, is to stand down next year. Of Lobban\u2019s appointment, Peace said: \u201cHe has served the UK government and the international intelligence community with great distinction for many years, and we look forward to having the benefit of his extensive experience as we advance our financial crime-fighting efforts.\u201d Standard Chartered did not disclose how much Lobban will be paid for a role that will involve attending at least four meetings a year. His term lasts for two years. Standard Chartered is not the only bank to create new committees to tackle financial crime. HSBC set up its financial system vulnerabilities committee in January 2013 following a \u00a31.1bn fine from US regulators for money-laundering offences. HSBC has since encountered further controversy following the leak of customer accounts of its Swiss banking arm, which showed that wealthy customers had been helped to avoid tax. Among the members of the HSBC committee are Dave Hartnett, a former head of HMRC. Others are a former employee of Swift, Leonard Schrank, the former head of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, Bill Hughes, and the counter-terrorism expert Nick Fishwick. Former financial regulators have also been hired by banks. HSBC appointed Bob Werner, a former head of the US Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, as head of its compliance function in December 2012. Barclays briefly had the former boss of the now defunct Financial Services Authority, Sir Hector Sants, on its payroll as head of compliance after the Libor rigging scandal. But Sants left after less than a year after being signed off sick with exhaustion and stress.",

      "bodyText": "Europe\u2019s anti-trust regulator has accused Russia\u2019s massive gas monopoly, Gazprom, of unfair pricing practices in Moscow\u2019s former satellite states of eastern Europe, launching a legal dispute that could result in multibillion-euro fines for the Kremlin\u2019s giant energy company. The \u201cstatement of objections \u201d issued by the European commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, on Wednesday accuses the world\u2019s biggest gas producer of charging eight EU member states in eastern Europe up to 40% more for their gas than elsewhere in the EU. The company manipulated contracts and included clauses barring clients from exporting gas more cheaply in the EU, according to the commission. It marks the second time in a week that Brussels has unveiled charges against globally dominant corporations. Last week Vestager issued charges against Google because of the search engine\u2019s alleged manipulation of its market dominance to lure browsers towards its shopping services. Vestager said that despite the accusations of overcharging in eight countries the investigation focused on five: the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, plus Poland and Bulgaria. The Baltic states in particular are almost entirely dependent on natural gas from Gazprom. The other three countries named were Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. \u201cGazprom is dominant in all these markets,\u201d said Vestager. \u201cOur preliminary view is that Gazprom is abusing this dominant position.\u201d Poland and the Baltic states are the EU\u2019s most determined allies in the standoff with Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. By contrast, the three countries omitted from the chargesheet are broadly pro-Russian on the issue of Ukraine and strong opponents of EU sanctions against Russia. Given the acute tensions between Russia and the European Union, Vestager admitted that many would see the charges against Gazprom aspolitical, not least since half of Russia\u2019s gas supplies to Europe are pumped via Ukraine and that the Kremlin has regularly used energy as a weapon in its disputes with Kiev and more broadly with Europe. While eastern Europe is almost entirely dependent on Gazprom for its gas, Germany is the corporation\u2019s biggest customer, buying about a third of its gas from the Russians. Vestager said she was not consulting national governments in Europe over the case since that would have the effect of \u201cpoliticising\u201d it. Gazprom, which has 12 weeks to respond to the charges, immediately rejected them as unfounded. It appeared to claim special status for its operations in the European Union because it was a Russian state-controlled entity, implying that its operations in the European Union \u2013 by far its biggest group of clients \u2013 were not subject to EU law. \u201cWe expect it will be duly noted that Gazprom was established beyond the jurisdiction of the EU, and that it is empowered by the laws of the Russian Federation with special socially significant functions and has the status of a strategic government-controlled business entity,\u201d it said.",

The euro was falling against the dollar and the yen, but despite the turbulent start to the trading day, no one had expected the near 1,000-point dive in share prices. In a matter of minutes the Dow Jones index lost almost 9% of its value \u2013 in a sequences of events that quickly became known as \u201cflash crash\u201d . Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off the share prices of household name companies like Proctor &amp; Gamble and General Electric. But the carnage , which took place at a speed never before witnessed, did not last long. The market rapidly regained its composure and eventually closed 3% lower. There was a frenzy of speculation about what might have caused the rout, with explanations ranging from fat fingered trading to a cyberattack. But within days, officials in the US were blaming big bets by a trader on Chicago\u2019s derivatives exchange. By the end of September, an official report by the two main US regulators pointed to a $4.1bn (\u00a32.7bn) sell order instigated by a US mutual fund, said to be Waddell &amp; Reed. At 2.32 pm, the mutual fund had used an automated algorithm trading strategy to sell contracts known as e-minis. It was the largest change in the daily position of any investor so far that year and sparked selling by other traders, including high frequency traders. The official report by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission outlined a \u201chot potato\u201d effect as the HFTs started and buying and then reselling the e-mini contracts. Some orders were executed at \u201cirrational prices\u201d as low as one penny or as high as $100,000 before the share prices returned to their pre-crash levels by 3pm. In just 20 minutes, 2bn shares worth $56bn had changed hands.",

      "bodyText": "Another uncertain day for stock markets, with the seemingly never ending attempts at fixing Greece\u2019s financial problems no nearer to a solution, jitters over the UK election and hints of rate rises in the UK and US after, respectively, more hawkish that expected Bank of England minutes and higher than forecast US house sales. Tesco ended the day down more than 5% after its record \u00a36.4bn loss, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100. The final scores showed: The FTSE 100 finished down 34.69 points or 0.49% at 7028.24 Germany\u2019s Dax dropped 0.6% to 11,867.37 France\u2019s Cac closed up 0.36% at 5211.09 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB added 0.32% to 23,315.40 Spain\u2019s Ibex ended down 0.2% at 11,399.2 The Athens market added 2.08% to 719.43 on reports the ECB had raised the cap again on emergency liquidity assistance to the country\u2019s banks On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 50 points or 0.27% higher. On that note, it\u2019s time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Over in Athens growing numbers of government MPs are giving voice to concerns that Greece\u2019s escalating standoff with creditors may ultimately only be solved if the country holds fresh elections or a referendum. Helena Smith reports: In a sign of just how perilous Greece\u2019s position is, ever more MPs from the governing Syriza party say fresh elections, or a referendum, may be the only way of solving the conundrum the country now faces. Two leading Syriza officials, including the prominent Euro parliamentarian Kostas Chrysogonos, raised the prospect today of a plebiscite being put before Greeks in the event of both sides failing to reach an \u201chonourable compromise. Chrysogonos said if creditors continued making \u201coutlandish demands\u201d of Greece, a referendum could be organized within a matter of weeks and the dilemma solved by democratic process. \u201cSyriza does not have a popular mandate for a rupture with Europe, nor does it have a popular mandate for blind submission,\u201d he said adding that it was impossible for an anti-austerity government to do what even the previous pro-bailout government had found impossible to achieve. \u201cWhat this government was given was a mandate to be tough in negotiations and the hope is we end up at an honourable compromise,\u201d he said speaking from Brussels. \u201cBut at some point those negotiations have to end, time is running out. If lenders continue to make outlandish demands, then the people can decide. I am sure a referendum could be organized in two weeks.\u201d Asked what the referendum would ask, the MEP said: \u201cDo you agree to the austerity measures being asked of Greece.\u201d Back with Greece, and regional officials are calling for a meeting with prime minister Alexis Tsipras in return for backing the government\u2019s call to effectively lend money to the central bank, Bloomberg reports: Officials from Greece\u2019s biggest cities and regions demanded an audience with the prime minister in exchange for their support after they were told to hand over their cash reserves to help keep the country afloat. Running out of options, Greece\u2019s anti-bailout coalition ordered municipalities on Monday to shift their cash balances to the central bank. Without the move, the government may have struggled to pay salaries and pensions. The country\u2019s two biggest umbrella groups for local governments, which represent mayors and governors from a myriad of parties, said they would hand over their money on the condition that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras briefs them on the \u201cthe true state\u201d of the economy. \u201cIf the country is in danger of bankruptcy, we will give everything we have,\u201d the Central Union of Municipalities said on its website on Wednesday. \u201cThey just have to tell us\u201d and we\u2019ll contribute to the national effort. Full story: Greek Mayors Demand Audience With Tsipras in Exchange for Help And here\u2019s a video of new Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis, explaining his thoughts on the future of the beleaguered supermarket: A successful sale of assets could ease pressure on Tesco\u2019s credit rating, according to Moody\u2019s. Sven Reinke, Moody\u2019s Vice President and Senior Analyst, said: We see early signs of improvement in Tesco\u2019s operating performance, driven by growing sales volumes resulting from its measures around service, availability and price. However, we do not expect a material increase in Tesco\u2019s underlying operating profitability in the 2015/16 fiscal year. Tesco seeks to monetise assets over the next 12 months. If that happens, it could ease the pressure exerted by the company\u2019s high leverage and deteriorated financial profile on its Ba1 ratings. A chart on Greek payments from Open Europe: German bond yields, which have been heading towards zero, have jumped sharply today, with the 10 year yield up from 0.1% to 0.16%. The bonds have been in demand recently - pushing down the yield - thanks to the European Central Bank\u2019s QE bond buying programme, as well as worries over Greece leaving the eurozone. But with Germany raising its growth forecast for this year from 1.5% to 1.8%, the yields have started to rise again. Could Greece default on a payment and still remain in the eurozone? Open Europe has been looking at the options, and concludes: In any scenario, a default or missed payment by Greece would increase animosity between the two sides and put the country\u2019s position in the Euro in jeopardy since it needs further cash from the Eurozone to secure it. That being said, a missed payment to the IMF would probably be manageable from an economic/financial standpoint, though the politics may be different. However, a missed payment to the ECB could well trigger a downward spiral towards Grexit. In all scenarios, the response of the ECB is likely to constitute a key turning point, once again highlighting just how important and political its position has become (intentionally or not). Ultimately, a temporary missed payment is something which in most scenarios could be managed at a political level (assuming the willingness exists). However, the same cannot be said of a decision to unilaterally write off a large amount of the loans. We have to remember that this remains a fundamental goal of the Syriza government and, as we have long argued, it seems likely that Greece will need some debt restructuring for its position to be sustainable. As we warned in 2012... this has been made all the more difficult by the fact the large majority of debt is now held by official creditors. In the end, this is the elephant in the room amongst all the short term negotiations to keep Greece afloat for the next month or two. This is all just a precursor to the bigger negotiations over how Greece will fund itself once the bailout expires at the end of June. Will such an agreement involve a debt write-down? Will it be another bailout? Will a Syriza-led government agree to the necessary conditions and be able to sell them at home sufficiently to maintain their power? These questions seem gargantuan given that the two sides can\u2019t currently agree on a short term reform list. The full commentary is here. Back with Tesco, and the early rise in the share price is now long gone. The supermarket is down nearly 5% at 223.5p, meaning it is the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 at the moment, in the wake of its hefty \u00a36.4bn loss and concerns about the outlook. Back with the eurozone, and consumer confidence dipped in April against expectations of an increase. An early estimate showed a fall to -4.6 this month compared to 3.7 in March, after three consecutive monthly increases. Teunis Brosens at ING said: The slight dip in sentiment may be partly explained by the fact that the perceived beneficial effect of low oil prices is wearing off: fuel prices at the pump have edged up 3 cents in April, compared to March. But even after this gentle correction, Eurozone consumers remain upbeat, with sentiment running well above its long-term average. Sentiment has also been running ahead of actual consumer spending. Retail sales suggest consumer spending was solid in the first quarter, and today\u2019s flash consumer sentiment shows that the second quarter also started quite well \u2013 just maybe not as stellar as some had hoped. Any market expectation that the strong existing homes data could lead to a policy change by the Federal Reserve is likely to be short lived, according to Rob Carnell at ING Bank. He said: With housing transactions a slow moving part of the economy, it is probably not wise to declare the US soft-patch over just yet, though there were also some encouraging increases in median house prices, which should help to support consumer confidence and spending in the coming months. That said, with next week\u2019s [Federal Reserve] meeting closing in, and limited additional data in advance of this, we see little likelihood that this result is enough to warrant a hint at a policy change in June from the accompanying April Federal Reserve text. The market response to this data should be a stronger US dollar and higher bond yields and implied Fed rates. But with this result fairly marginal for the Fed decision, we don\u2019t think any market response will be substantial, or necessarily long-lived. US homes sales rose more sharply than expected in March, suggesting an earlier than expected interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve could still be in prospect despite recent weak data. Existing home sales jumped by 6.1% to an annual rate of 5.19m units, the highest since September 2013. Analysts had been expecting a 3% increase. The figures have pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average into the red after an early rise, down around 17 points. German finance minister spokesman Martin Jaeger has been talking about when Greece has to deliver its reform programmes, and it throws a few more dates into the pot: Time for some refreshments, US-style. And it looks like consumers are turning back to Coke but still shunning McDonald\u2019s. Coca-Cola has reported a 1% rise in first quarter revenues to $5.1bn, the rise in nine quarters. The company has been hit by sluggish demand for carbonated drinks, partly because of health concerns, but it has been diversifying its business by taking stakes in businesses in faster growing markets. But McDonald\u2019s is still struggling after tough competition in the US and food scandals in China and Japan. First quarter like for like sales fell 2.3%, and much will now rest on a turnaround plan from new chief executive Stever Easterbrook, which will be revealed on May 4. The Hounslow man accused of contributing to the 2010 flash crash on the US market - when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 5% in five minutes - has vowed to fight extradition when he appeared in court earlier. A full hearing on extradition will now be heard in August. Here\u2019s our latest report: Tesco has wiped the slate clean with these figures (a \u00a36.4bn loss let\u2019s not forget). That\u2019s the view of HSBC analyst David McCarthy, who says: Ultimately, there is encouragement in this update: UK volume growth is the best in many years, increased cost savings have been identified and the portfolio review continues to progress. As such, this represents another step in the right direction and a sign that there is a clear plan. This will be led by the UK business where improving sales trends and better margins are encouraging. We continue to believe that Tesco can return to a sustainable UK operating margin of over 4%, given its scale advantages. Tesco is now following the right strategy, in our view, and has the right management in place to achieve this. This drives our positive view on the stock and we retain our buy rating and 295p fair value target price. Greece hopes to get \u20ac2.5bn from its plan to get state entities and local governments to effectively lend to the state, according to deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas. According to Reuters, Mardas told Greece\u2019s Star TV: My target is \u20ac2.5bn. I want this \u20ac2.5bn to cover any needs that may occur, I repeat, taking into account the worst case scenarios and the needs for May. Meanwhile the World Economic Forum has published a piece on whether Greece will indeed run out of cash. The conclusion is a relatively positive one, in the short term at least: Greece has looming repayment deadlines....[It] has to repay \u20ac6.7 billion to the ECB and \u20ac9.8 billion to the IMF in 2015. (There are also maturing treasury bills, but these are rolled over by the largely state-owned Greek banks). Greece also has to pay some interest on its liabilities, though not that much, because interest payments on EFSF loans (the largest creditor of the country) are deferred. The question is therefore whether the primary budget surplus and the possible liquidation of some financial assets would be sufficient for the Greek government to carry on paying financial obligations until an agreement is reached with the creditors in the coming weeks or months. My guess is yes, at least perhaps till the summer, when large repayment will become due. If the report is correct that the ECB has raised the cap on emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) that Greek banks can draw by \u20ac1.5bn, this follows an \u20ac800m increase last week. The ECB has been raising the cap gradually to keep the pressure on Greece to come to a deal with its creditors. Back with Greece, and state minister and Syriza MP Nikos Pappas has indicated the government is unlikely to back down on pension cuts and tax hikes, adding more uncertainty to the chances of a deal with its lenders. Pappas told a parliamentary committee (quotes from Reuters): The negotiations have their difficulties and the lenders have tabled requests which have not been accepted so far. And they will not be accepted because they are the red lines of the government - accepting VAT hikes on islands and pension cuts. The government seeks...and will achieve a solution. Not just any agreement. Time for a recap: Tesco has reported losses of \u00a36.4bn, the worst result in its 96-year history and Britain\u2019s biggest-ever retail loss, after huge writedowns on the value of its property portfolio. The annual result was worse than the City\u2019s most dire predictions that the group would fall \u00a35bn into the red. Chief executive Dave Lewis said he had tried to make a break with Tesco\u2019s recent history by accounting for all likely events. But Lewis warned that the food retail market remained \u201cchallenging\u201d and that, despite signs of improving sales, Tesco\u2019s performance would be volatile for some time to come. Lewis, who joined Tesco in September, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long, long way to go and I don\u2019t think it will be smooth as we move through the changes we want to make. We have sought to draw a line under the past and to rebuild from here. Everything we know [about] we have dealt with.\u201d The former Unilever executive was drafted in to turn around the fortunes of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer following a series of profit warnings amid a ferocious price war with rivals..... Here\u2019s the full story: On a conference call, Lewis refused to pledge that trading profits wouldn\u2019t continue to fall this year, but insisted the the company is getting stronger. Highlights start here One analyst have called on Tesco to consider shutting up to 200 stores. Other, though, believe the company\u2019s underying performance is improving. Shares in Tesco have been volatile today, and are now down 1.8% at 230p. Speaking of Greece... EU officials have said Athens won\u2019t present a concrete list of reforms when eurozone finance minister meet on Friday. Thomas Wieser, who heads the Eurogroup Working Group, said: The clock is ticking. There won\u2019t be a new list in Riga, but over the course of May it must finally be reached.\u201d More details here. Despite that, Greek bond yields have recovered some value this morning after being pounded by default fears in recent days. Regular eurozone crisis followers may find this chart interesting too, showing how Greece could arrive safely at a third bailout, or find itself plunged into capital controls..... Six point four billion pounds is a lot of money in anyone\u2019s book. Enough to run a small government department for a year, or cover 10% of Britain\u2019s education budget. It\u2019s also slightly more than the amount of money (\u20ac7.2bn) that Greece needs from its creditors soon to avoid a default: Fund manager Rahul Sharma has tweeted some interesting analysis of Tesco\u2019s results this morning: As if Tesco didn\u2019t have enough problems, its pension deficit has swelled from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a33.9bn. The company is also consulting staff about replacing its final salary (\u2018defined benefit) pension scheme with a new \u201cdefined contribution scheme\u201d, as another way of strengthening its balance sheet. Matthew Harrison, managing director of Lincoln Pension, says this is part of a wider trend, given the massive rally in bonds (which push down the rate of return, or yield, that investors get) Although the pension deficit numbers in the Tesco situation are unusually large, the general theme is not an uncommon one for UK pension schemes. It provides a timely reminder that even in this phase of increasing consumer and business confidence, defined benefit pension benefits are not necessarily secure. With gilt yields persisting at historically low levels, deficits remain high. Where this is coupled with challenging trading conditions for the employer the, sometimes delicate, balance between the financial position of an employer and the scale of its Defined Benefit pension obligations can easily be disrupted. Tesco\u2019s CEO is ruling out duplicating Aldi and Lidl\u2019s strategy of carrying much fewer products. Back in January, we reported that Tesco was looking to cut its range of 90,000 products by a third. That would still dwarf the discounters. For example, Tesco offers 28 types of ketchup to dip one\u2019s chips into, compared to Aldi\u2019s lone own-brand offering. More than 20 million Tesco shares have changed hands in the City today, as many as on a trading day normally. Struggling to understand how the value of Tesco\u2019s store has slumped by almost \u00a35bn? Brewin Dolphin equity analyst Nicla Di Palma has the answer: Every year Tesco reviews the carrying value of its stores to ensure that they are supported by either their value in use or their fair value less the cost of disposal. Due to difficult industry conditions the value of property has declined: basically, as the food retail industry faces difficult conditions and cuts its store opening programmes, the value of supermarkets declines. The early rally in Tesco\u2019s is petering out; they\u2019re now down 0.5% (in line with the FTSE 100 this morning) Lewis Sturdy, dealer at London Capital Group, explains why traders are still nervous about piling into Tesco shares: \u2018Investors have the double edged sword of what looks like a clear line being drawn under this annus horribilis, while the dividend is cut and uncertainty about is resumption will keep many yield seekers lukewarm.\u2019 The decline of Tesco\u2019s biggest stores continues: My colleague Sarah Butler has taken a tour of a Tesco store with retail expert Clive Black. Their verdict - prices were keen and staff were plentiful, but you couldn\u2019t say the same about the customers.... Full story: Tesco\u2019s troubles - it\u2019s easy to keep a quiet store clean In other news... the minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s most recent meeting were just released, showing that policymakers voted 9-0 to leave interest rates unchanged (again) a fortnight ago. They also predicted that UK inflation will probably turn negative in the next couple of months - having been zero in February and March. Dave Lewis is now speaking to City analysts: Lewis arrived at Tesco last summer with the nickname \u201cDrastic Dave\u201d, due to his reputation for reviving struggling brands at Unilever. He\u2019s living up to the moniker, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: On a trading basis profits came in at \u00a31.4bn with the most recent quarter seeing the supermarkets first improvement in like for like sales in over four years, which would appear to suggest that some of the recent changes that were announced at the end of last year are starting to bear fruit. Today\u2019s record losses of \u00a35.7bn may well have been more than markets expected but in a way they are also encouraging, as they signal a determination by management to clean the slate and get on with turning the business around, and drawing a line under a pretty awful last couple of years. We shouldn\u2019t forget that Tesco has already cut thousands of jobs as part of Lewis\u2019s turnaround strategy. Dave Lewis denied this morning that he has \u2018kitchen-sinked\u2019 the problems at Tesco, by throwing as much bad news as possible into the mix today. But Professor Crawford Spence of Warwick Business School is convinced that the Tesco CEO is trying to make life a little easier in future years: Spence says: \u201cThese figures are absolutely huge - nearly the biggest loss in UK corporate history. However, they need to be understood in context. They relate mostly to asset write-downs rather than poor trading performance. Underlying trading performance for Tesco has actually not been too bad in recent months. In many ways Tesco has decided to make these losses now rather than later. It all needs to be understood within CEO Dave Lewis\u2019s strategy of \u2018taking a bath\u2019 in his first couple of years in the job - basically, if he gets all the skeletons out of the closet early on then Tesco will look bad initially, but he will give himself a set of benchmarks that are relatively easy to surpass in the coming years.\u201d Tesco\u2019s problems do put life\u2019s little indignities into perspective: This isn\u2019t only Tesco\u2019s biggest ever pre-tax loss. It\u2019s also the biggest ever suffered by a UK retailer. By some distance. We reckon it\u2019s also the sixth-largest in UK corporate history, but someway shy of the \u00a327bn loss suffered by Royal Bank of Scotland in 2009 when the empire built by Fred Goodwin spectacularly collapsed. Today marks the \u201cthe official end of the Tesco era\u201d, says John Ibbotson of Retail Vision. But he also believes Dave Lewis has taken the right decisions since being lured from Unilever last year to tackle one of the biggest, and toughest, \u201cThe irony is that Tesco is on the right path. Amid the extensive wreckage left by his predecessors, Dave Lewis has done all the right things, and made all the tough decisions, to put Tesco back on track. \u201cLewis has delivered direction, reduced prices, cut costs, closed the Cheshunt head office and put more staff into stores. Most fundamentally, he has changed the retailer\u2019s entire corporate philosophy. But Tesco will never be \u201cthe force it once was\u201d \u201cWith this huge loss, the decadent retail dynasty of Tesco has come to an end.\u201d But is that a bad thing for the UK? Independent high street stores won\u2019t miss the days when Tesco was racking up record profits and expanding into virtually every postcode in the land. Investors seem to believe CEO Dave Lewis\u2019s line that Tesco is getting better (slowly). Tesco rreported that like-for-like sales volumes in the UK rose for the first time in over four years. And sales turnover improved in the last three months, to a drop of only 1.0%. This will reassure Dave Lewis \u2013 Tesco\u2019s shares are continuing to rise.... Tesco chief Dave Lewis needs to keep shutting stores, slash staff numbers and drop less popular products, reckons Mike Dennis, retail analyst at City firm Cantor FitzGerald. In a research note, Dennis makes five recommendations: We believe Tesco should consider closing 200 underperforming supermarkets/superstores and focus on growing the more profitable remaining 700 stores (excluding Express), in addition, this should also allow for \u00a340m of cost savings from the closure of a distribution centre Tesco should not only reduce its slowest selling product range, but also reduce credit days to secure a much lower net cost of goods to invest and recapture its customer base and squeeze Sainsbury\u2019s who we believe have been the main net beneficiary of Tesco\u2019s poor trading Matt Davies, Tesco\u2019s UK CEO as of 1st June, should consider a further reduction in staff and a significant simplification of central functions and category management. Aldi UK today generates twice the sales per full-time employee compared to Tesco UK and is expected to report higher trading profits In our research note, entitled \u201cBox Cutter\u201d dated 11th July 2014, we stated that Tesco needed to address the 2.67m sq ft of uneconomic superstore and hypermarket retail space. We believe this space could be used for profitable destination leisure facilities, concessions in various related home categories and other healthcare services. Tesco needs to work with suppliers to reduce excess capacity in certain categories in the European supply chain to allow it to squeeze the discounters\u2019 cost of goods. Ken Odeluga of City Index reckons that Dave Lewis is \u201cclearing the decks\u201d by announcing the biggest loss in Tesco\u2019s history today: Tesco\u2019s final results for 2014 are a fitting way for the company to cap its most challenging year for decades. In a move long anticipated by investors, the firm has written down the value of its stores by \u00a34.7bn, pushing its bottom line into the red by \u00a36.38bn, its worst-ever annual loss. The stock market is open and Tesco shares are .... up slightly. They\u2019ve risen by 1.35p to 236p, as traders digest today\u2019s results. That suggests the City still has faith in Dave Lewis. My colleague Sean Farrell has tweeted the key points from the conference call: Tesco has heard enough from the press pack for the moment. Dave Lewis wraps up the call, reminding us that today\u2019s \u00a36.38bn loss is mainly due to one-off writedowns [see 7.28am for details]. And he repeats his thanks to Tesco\u2019s staff. They\u2019ve been \u201cnothing short of brilliant\u2019, he says. Dave Lewis won\u2019t give any guarantees about future dividend payments. Could trading profits this year actually be lower than in the last 12 months? Our aspiration is maintain our profit level at this year\u2019s level (\u00a31.4bn), but if we need to make investments to improve our offering, then we\u2019ll do it, Lewis replies. So yes, in other words. Alex Ralph of the Times nails it -- are you shocked by the scale of the decline at Tesco? Dave Lewis concedes that \u201cIt\u2019s a very significant day\u201d for Tesco, given the size of today\u2019s large statutory loss. We think it\u2019s right that we face into these changes, and create the platform to \u201cbuild a great business\u201d. And Lewis insists that he\u2019s turning Tesco around. More people are coming into stores, transactions are increasing, and volumes are growing again. Reuters is reporting that Tesco shares could fall by up to 3% when trading begins in a few minutes.... Have you done enough to put the problems of the past behind you and reassure the City? Lewis: We have sought to draw a line and put the past behind us... but it would be a \u201chostage to fortune\u201d to say that nothing bad will ever emerge. This is a real kitchen-sinking job, isn\u2019t it? asks the BBC. Lewis says he doesn\u2019t recognise the term - today\u2019s results accurately reflect the situation. On those \u00a34.7bn property writedowns... Tesco explains that it\u2019s cut \u00a33.8bn off the value of its operational stores (due to cash flow and property values). The remaining \u00a3925m is the value of sites it is exiting (not being build, as I wrongly wrote earlier, sorry) Bloomberg next -- will Tesco have to implement deeper price cuts? Lewis replies that he believes customers want \u201cstable, low, simple prices that they can rely on\u201d. He\u2019s committed to delivering it for customers wherever possible. So, he\u2019s not announcing a new price war this morning. First question goes to Reuters. Can you give more details about Tesco\u2019s portfolio review? The review is still in place, Lewis adds. Dunnhumby (Tesco\u2019s customer data arm) is the main item on the table. Nothing else to announce, but a whole lot of work is going on. And is Tesco still planning to sell assets before considering issuing equity -- (ie, tapping shareholders for funds through a rights issue)? We will look at all funding strategies... continue to keep all options on the table. But Lewis adds that he believes the firm should look at its assets first, before going to investors for cash. Today\u2019s headlines will undoubtedly focus on our loss and one-off writedowns (\u2018fraid so, Dave), but the underlying picture is improving, Lewis concludes. Onto questions...... Lewis says there has been very intense activity in Tesco, especially since January. We couldn\u2019t have achieved a fraction of what we\u2019ve done without the positivity and enthusiasm of our staff, he adds. It will take 18 months to fully reset Tesco\u2019s relationship with its suppliers, Lewis says. Dave Lewis is holding a press call with reporters now. He\u2019s confirming that shareholders won\u2019t get a dividend this year. 43 underperforming stores have now been closed, and Tesco is talking to developers about sites where it will no longer build a store. The City will give its verdict in 30 minutes, when the London stock market opens. Traders had expected a big loss - just not this big - so the reaction could be muted.... Tesco\u2019s results are online here, including this chart showing how the company slumped into its record loss in the 2014-15 financial year: Tesco\u2019s huge loss is due to a series of one-off writedowns totalling \u00a37bn. It has taken an impairment charge of \u00a33.8bn again the value of the stores it operates, blamed on \u201cchallenging industry conditions and the decline in profit over the last year\u201d It has also slashed the value of \u201cwork-in-progress\u201d (ie, stores being built) (stores being closed) by \u00a3925m. Tesco has also taken written off \u00a3570m in stock-related charges, which follows the adoption of a forward-looking provisioning methodology. That follows the scandal last year, when Tesco admitted that it had overstated its profits and vowed to change the way it booked revenue from suppliers. There are various other write-downs too, including \u00a3630m relating to its investment with China Resources Enterprise. The drop in food prices in the UK has hit Tesco. It says: The UK grocery market remains highly competitive with macro-economic deflationary pressure and significant price investment across the industry. For the year as a whole, UK like-for-like sales excluding fuel declined by (3.6)% but we saw an improving trend into the second half driven by investments across the offer. Dave Lewis, the executive parachuted into Tesco last summer to rebuilt its fortunes, admits that it has been \u201ca very difficult year for Tesco\u201d. The results we have published today reflect a deterioration in the market and, more significantly, an erosion of our competitiveness over recent years. We have faced into this reality, sought to draw a line under the past and begun to rebuild, and already we are beginning to see early encouraging signs from what we\u2019ve done so far. Lewis says that his turnaround plan is working, with \u201ca steady increase in footfall, transactions and, most significantly, volumes.... More customers are buying more things at Tesco.\u201d But ha also admits that: \u201cThe market is still challenging and we are not expecting any let up in the months ahead.\u201d Trading profits, which strip out one-off factors, have also tumbled. Tesco posted a trading profit of \u00a31.4bn for the last financial year, down 58.2% year-on-year. Today\u2019s results show that Tesco is struggling in the increasingly competitive supermarket sector. Like-for-like sales, excluding fuel and VAT, fell by 1.7% in the last quarter. The City was braced for something nasty, after Sky reported last night that the loss could reach \u00a35bn. But still -- a loss of this scale simply wasn\u2019t expected. It\u2019s a truly stunning loss. Breaking: Britain\u2019s largest supermarket has just stunned the City with the biggest loss in its history. Tesco has posted a pre-tax loss of almost \u00a36.4bn for 2014, even worse than the most pessimistic analysts had expected. That includes a \u00a37bn of one-off charges, which have driven the company deep into the red. More to follow.... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we\u2019ll be watching Greece, as usual. Deputy finance ministers from across the eurozone are meeting later to discuss the progress towards locking some aid. Time continues to tick away, with Athens facing public sector wage bills next week The other big story today is Tesco, which is reporting its 2014 results in a few minutes time. The City is braced for the biggest loss in its history; as new CEO Dave Lewis gets to grips with the company: Britain\u2019s biggest supermarket will post its first yearly figures since Mr Lewis was drafted in to turn around its fortunes following a series of profit warnings amid a ferocious price war with rivals. They are expected to show trading profits falling by 58% to \u00a31.4bn, their lowest level for more than a decade. Analysts also foresee billions more being subtracted from the group\u2019s bottom line as it writes down the value of its properties by around \u00a33bn as well as facing up to a pension fund deficit swelling to as much as \u00a35bn. Experts at Barclays have pencilled in a statutory pre-tax loss at around \u00a32.9bn with Shore Capital estimating around \u00a33bn while some reports suggest losses could be as high as \u00a35bn. Shore\u2019s Clive Black said: \u201cAt a statutory level, it\u2019s going to be a horror show. But, for shareholders, it is about Dave Lewis and the future.\u201d We\u2019ll also be watching out for the minutes of the Bank of England\u2019s latest monetary policy committee meeting, at 930am BST, and other key developments through the day.....",

That being said, a missed payment to the IMF would probably be manageable from an economic/financial standpoint, though the politics may be different.

However, the same cannot be said of a decision to unilaterally write off a large amount of the loans. We have to remember that this remains a fundamental goal of the Syriza government and, as <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/blog/what-deal-could-be-struck-to-keep-greece-in-the-eurozone/\">we have long argued</a>, it seems likely that Greece will need some debt restructuring for its position to be sustainable. <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/eurozone-and-finance/second-greek-bailout-bad-greece-bad-eurozone-taxpayers/\">As we warned in 2012</a>... this has been made all the more difficult by the fact the large majority of debt is now held by official creditors.</p> <p>In the end, this is the elephant in the room amongst all the short term negotiations to keep Greece afloat for the next month or two. This is all just a precursor to the bigger negotiations over how Greece will fund itself once the bailout expires at the end of June. Will such an agreement involve a debt write-down? Will it be another bailout? Will a Syriza-led government agree to the necessary conditions and be able to sell them at home sufficiently to maintain their power?

Sentiment has also been running ahead of actual consumer spending.

      "bodyText": "Chief executives recruited to halt a corporate crisis start with two advantages. They can gather all the accumulated dross and dump it on shareholders in one steaming heap. Then, having demonstrated the size of the job ahead, they can be vague about when life will improve for investors as opposed to customers. Dave Lewis made full use of both prerogatives on Wednesday. Tesco\u2019s thumping loss of \u00a36.4bn was suitably horrendous. In large part, it was a function of \u00a37bn of one-off charges, everything from \u00a34.7bn of lower property valuations in the UK to a \u00a3630m recognition that Chinese business is rotten. Fair enough. Past management, over a decade and a half, plainly overinvested and splurged capital wastefully. Vagueness about the future, on the other hand, will only be tolerated for so long. At a pure trading level, Tesco was slightly loss-making in the UK in the second half of the year. Investors understand the reasons: there was a crisis and Tesco had to cut prices in a hurry and add staff in its stores. But what shareholders want to know now is how long the state of emergency will last. Over the full year, the profit margin in the UK was 1.1%, a far cry from the impossible 5.2% that Lewis\u2019s predecessor, Philip Clarke, ridiculously attempted to defend. When should a leaner Tesco, with a smaller head office and Lewis\u2019s new collaborative approach with suppliers, plan to return to the top of the supermarket league on margins? Lewis would be silly to set a firm date at this stage. But surely, on a group-wide basis, he could commit to beating last year\u2019s trading profit of \u00a31.4bn in the coming year. He didn\u2019t. It is merely an \u201caspiration\u201d, he said. In other words, in trading terms, Tesco may not have hit the bottom yet. Full marks for caution, but the other rule for new chief executives is that honeymoon periods last about 18 months, tops. In a year\u2019s time, Lewis must show that the \u201cearly encouraging signs from what we have done so far\u201d will produce a discernible improvement in profits. If not, the worries about the stretched balance sheet will intensify. Net debt, even ignoring lease commitments and the deficit in the pension fund, was \u00a38.5bn at the year-end. That\u2019s one hell of a sum to carry if trading profits can\u2019t be relied upon to rebound quickly. No dividend, a halving of capital expenditure and proceeds from disposals will help the debt position. But the numbers require the disposals to happen \u2013 and at decent prices. To be fair, Lewis has more than matched expectations in eight months at the helm. Tesco is no longer being beaten up by smaller rivals and Clarke\u2019s strange diversions into video-streaming have been abandoned. But shareholders still care about hard returns, and when they will arrive. They won\u2019t buy the Vague Dave act for ever.",

      "body": "<p>Chief executives recruited to halt a corporate crisis start with two advantages. They can gather all the accumulated dross and dump it on shareholders in one steaming heap. Then, having demonstrated the size of the job ahead, they can be vague about when life will improve for investors as opposed to customers.</p> <p>Dave Lewis made full use of both prerogatives on Wednesday. Tesco\u2019s thumping loss of \u00a36.4bn was suitably horrendous. In large part, it was a function of \u00a37bn of one-off charges, everything from \u00a34.7bn of lower property valuations in the UK to a \u00a3630m recognition that Chinese business is rotten. Fair enough. Past management, over a decade and a half, plainly overinvested and splurged capital wastefully.</p> <p>Vagueness about the future, on the other hand, will only be tolerated for so long. At a pure trading level, Tesco was slightly loss-making in the UK in the second half of the year. Investors understand the reasons: there was a crisis and Tesco had to cut prices in a hurry and add staff in its stores. But what shareholders want to know now is how long the state of emergency will last.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/22/tesco-suffers-record-64bn-loss\">Tesco reports record \u00a36.4bn loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the full year, the profit margin in the UK was 1.1%, a far cry from the impossible 5.2% that Lewis\u2019s predecessor, Philip Clarke, ridiculously attempted to defend. When should a leaner Tesco, with a smaller head office and Lewis\u2019s new collaborative approach with suppliers, plan to return to the top of the supermarket league on margins? </p> <p>Lewis would be silly to set a firm date at this stage. But surely, on a group-wide basis, he could commit to beating last year\u2019s trading profit of \u00a31.4bn in the coming year. He didn\u2019t. It is merely an \u201caspiration\u201d, he said. In other words, in trading terms, Tesco may not have hit the bottom yet.</p> <p>Full marks for caution, but the other rule for new chief executives is that honeymoon periods last about 18 months, tops. In a year\u2019s time, Lewis must show that the \u201cearly encouraging signs from what we have done so far\u201d will produce a discernible improvement in profits.</p> <p>If not, the worries about the stretched balance sheet will intensify. Net debt, even ignoring lease commitments and the deficit in the pension fund, was \u00a38.5bn at the year-end. That\u2019s one hell of a sum to carry if trading profits can\u2019t be relied upon to rebound quickly. No dividend, a halving of capital expenditure and proceeds from disposals will help the debt position. But the numbers require the disposals to happen \u2013 and at decent prices.</p> <p>To be fair, Lewis has more than matched expectations in eight months at the helm. Tesco is no longer being beaten up by smaller rivals and Clarke\u2019s strange diversions into video-streaming have been abandoned. But shareholders still care about hard returns, and when they will arrive. They won\u2019t buy the Vague Dave act for ever.</p>",

BrewDog\u2019s investment scheme, accredited by the UK Listing Authority, will offer 526,316 shares in the brewery. It will use the money to build a new brewery with three times the capacity of its existing site in Ellon, Aberdeenshire. The company, which pays the living wage, has also pledged to invest up to \u00a32m in environmental technology. In exchange for their cash, investors will get a stake in the business and perks such as discounts online and at BrewDog bars and a complimentary beer on their birthday. BrewDog has ridden the wave of enthusiasm for craft ales, which have taken off to the extent that the Office for National Statistics added them to the basket of goods it uses to calculate inflation. Even as pubs have continued to close at a rate of about 30 a week, the number of UK independent brewers has increased to more than 1,400 \u2013 the highest number since the second world war. Equity crowdfunding has grown rapidly since the financial crisis as a way for small companies or startups to bypass banks for funding, often from enthusiasts for the product. However, the Financial Conduct Authority classifies equity crowdfunding as a risky investment because most small businesses fail.",

The tone from the MPC seems to be taking baby steps in the hawkish direction,\u201d said Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank.</p> <p>The improvement in the outlook for the eurozone economies, where a \u20ac60bn-a-month money creation programme is under way, appeared to be a key factor influencing the MPC.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough it was too early to be confident, a succession of firmer data suggested that growth in the euro-area economy was picking up, supported by a confluence of factors \u2013 improving credit conditions, a recovery in confidence, a lower oil price, accommodative monetary policy and a weaker currency,\u201d the minutes said.</p> <p>But in Britain the MPC said disappointing wage settlements \u2013 a key factor in determining the outlook for inflation \u2013 had caused it to reduce estimates for pay growth over 2015 as a whole from 2.6% to 2.3%.</p> <p>That finding chimed with a separate survey showing only a fifth of workers expected their pay to rise by 2% or more this year, while as many as a third expected a pay freeze. Just one in 10 of the almost 2,000 workers polled by Ipsos Mori for Markit expected a rise of 3% or more.</p> <p>Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson, said: \u201cThe Bank of England is currently forecasting the economy to grow by 2.9% this year, fuelled by consumer spending rising on the back of higher real employee earnings.

      "bodyText": "Bank of England policymakers voted unanimously to leave borrowing costs on hold this month, but two members of the monetary policy committee saw the decision as \u201cfinely balanced\u201d, shortening the odds on a rate rise in the coming months. Minutes published on Wednesday showed that two anti-inflation hawks \u2013 likely to be Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, who voted for higher rates through late 2014 \u2013 were again contemplating a rise, despite suggestions that wages would not grow as fast this year as previously expected. The news led City analysts to suggest the MPC is inching towards tightening policy. \u201cOverall, the only way is up for interest rates \u2013 but not yet. The tone from the MPC seems to be taking baby steps in the hawkish direction,\u201d said Alan Clarke, of Scotiabank. The improvement in the outlook for the eurozone economies, where a \u20ac60bn-a-month money creation programme is under way, appeared to be a key factor influencing the MPC. \u201cAlthough it was too early to be confident, a succession of firmer data suggested that growth in the euro-area economy was picking up, supported by a confluence of factors \u2013 improving credit conditions, a recovery in confidence, a lower oil price, accommodative monetary policy and a weaker currency,\u201d the minutes said. But in Britain the MPC said disappointing wage settlements \u2013 a key factor in determining the outlook for inflation \u2013 had caused it to reduce estimates for pay growth over 2015 as a whole from 2.6% to 2.3%. That finding chimed with a separate survey showing only a fifth of workers expected their pay to rise by 2% or more this year, while as many as a third expected a pay freeze. Just one in 10 of the almost 2,000 workers polled by Ipsos Mori for Markit expected a rise of 3% or more. Markit\u2019s chief economist, Chris Williamson, said: \u201cThe Bank of England is currently forecasting the economy to grow by 2.9% this year, fuelled by consumer spending rising on the back of higher real employee earnings. The worry is therefore that weak pay growth means the economy is reliant on ultra-low inflation to boost consumer spending power.\u201d With inflation falling to zero in February and March, after the plunge in global oil prices, the MPC minutes acknowledged that the Bank governor, Mark Carney, would be forced to write a second open letter to the chancellor, explaining why inflation has dropped more than one percentage point below the 2% target. The weakness of wage growth is at the heart of a serious divergence in views among MPC members that has been aired publicly in recent months, with the Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, arguing in a speech that interest rates might even have to be cut to zero to prevent deflation. Wednesday\u2019s minutes of the policy meeting, held on 8 and 9 April, confirmed that there was a wide range of views about the future path of interest rates. The MPC said it would take stock of the state of the labour market and the amount of slack in the economy in the runup to the publication of its next quarterly inflation report on 13 May. But Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, said even if the Bank\u2019s analysis suggested inflation is poised to take off, the MPC was unlikely to make any major decisions over the next month with the possibility of coalition negotiations looming. \u201cComing so soon after the election and with a significant chance that the new government would not yet be known, the MPC may not want to do anything that triggers market volatility in the May report,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Blindingly shiny floors and dangling signs promising price cuts on everyday basics such as eggs, sugar, salmon and mince. If the Tesco Extra Colney Hatch store in north London is anything to go by, Dave Lewis has already made some eye-catching changes in his efforts to turn around the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain. Tesco\u2019s new chief executive may have wheeled out a record \u00a36.4bn loss on Wednesday, unveiling property writedowns and pension deficit payments, but stores are already benefiting from investment in lower prices and more shopfloor staff. \u201cThis store has some of the best merchandising I\u2019ve seen,\u201d says Clive Black, a retail analyst with Shore Capital, as he surveys spotless aisles, the products lined up with near-military precision. There is a steady stream of customers but no queues as plenty of staff work the tills. Of course, it\u2019s easy to keep a quiet store clean, neat and well-stocked. Big stores such as Colney are falling out of favour with shoppers. Lewis must try to tempt more customers back by getting closer to the discounters on the price of branded goods and basics while offering better service and choice. Industry analysis suggests shoppers have begun to respond, sending Tesco\u2019s underlying sales into positive territory for the first time in over a year. In his first few months at the head of Tesco, Lewis has made some dramatic decisions, closing 43 stores and pulling out of 49 planned developments as well as thousands of head office job cuts. Keeping sales momentum going may involve less dramatic action but it is no less important. It will mean the assessment of every aisle in the supermarket to cut the number of products on sale. Black says: \u201cTen years ago the world was Tesco\u2019s oyster and there wasn\u2019t a sector of the market it wasn\u2019t going into. Now online retail has taken 20% of the market and specialist retailers are fighting back by offering greater authority in their category.\u201d In that light, some categories, such as TVs or other electrical goods, may disappear altogether while clothing, which is performing well for supermarkets, is likely to get a bigger spot. Other changes will be less obvious. Black says Tesco needs to reduce the number of products it sells so that it can become more efficient and so cut prices to become more competitive with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. \u201cThey have to sell more of each product line. Cutting the range makes store replenishment easier, improves availability, reduces distribution costs and means they can give higher volumes to individual suppliers in return for lower prices. \u201cIt\u2019s no big explosion. It\u2019s an iterative process nibbling away.\u201d Already Tesco has begun editing the brands it sells under a plan to reduce its range by 30%. Kingsmill bread has been delisted, for example, so that the retailer can give more space and bigger orders to Hovis in exchange for lower prices. A large loaf of Hovis now sells for 78p compared with around \u00a31 a year ago. In the nappies aisle, Pampers appear to have won out over Huggies, whose space is very limited. But in other areas there is still a plethora of brands \u2013 more than five brands of butter and the same of cheddar cheese, for example, on top of Tesco\u2019s three in-house brands. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of opportunity to make reductions there,\u201d says Black. He points out that the fast-growing discounters usually have just one brand. He believes Lewis might also consider reducing Tesco\u2019s range of own-label brands. Sales of all the supermarkets\u2019 lowest-priced own-label ranges have suffered as the discounters are offering better quality basics at only a slightly higher price. Black suggests Tesco could merge its cheapest Everyday Value range with its main Tesco-branded line. Making things simpler would enable Tesco to cut the price of its main line further while really challenging the discounters on quality. \u201cIf people see that they are getting prices cheaper on the basics then Tesco can emphasise what it can do that the discounters can\u2019t \u2013 more brands, non-food, online, petrol stations, better choice and services like phone shops and opticians. There are a dozen things where the supermarkets will always have the advantage.\u201d Matt Davies, the former Pets at Home and Halfords boss who arrives as the head of Tesco\u2019s UK business next month, will have the job of ensuring that Tesco doesn\u2019t become too boring and similar to discounters while improving efficiency and cutting costs. While Lewis\u2019s predecessor, Phil Clarke, blew millions on expensive store revamps including new restaurants and services to try to impress shoppers, Davies will have a very tight budget. The capital expenditure budget for the UK has dived from around \u00a32.5bn to just \u00a31bn a year. \u201cIt\u2019s about sweating the existing assets,\u201d says Black. \u201cThe priority is product and merchandising not fixtures and fittings. In the past there was the slightly naive view that you could out-merchandise the competition and become the everyday man\u2019s John Lewis. They misread the reality of people\u2019s need to save money and the discounters thrived.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Tesco reports record \u00a36.4bn loss", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tesco has crashed to the biggest loss ever recorded on the UK high street, slumping \u00a36.4bn into the red as a result of huge writedowns on the value of its property portfolio and stock. Dave Lewis, the chief executive parachuted in to mastermind a turnaround last year, described the loss as a \u201cbig significant number\u201d. But the former Unilever executive insisted the supermarket was on the road to recovery after a tough 2014 in which it suffered a \u00a3263m accounting scandal and the exit of the former chief executive, Philip Clarke, following slumping sales and profits. \u201cThis patient is okay \u2026 Our job is to allow it to be healthier. There is nothing critical about its finances,\u201d he said. The far worse than expected loss in the year to 28 February was revealed as the retailer confirmed it had axed nearly 5,000 head officeand UK store management jobs as well as more than 4,000 roles overseas and at the group\u2019s banking division. A further 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 43 Tesco stores earlier this month. The \u00a3416m cost of those redundancies contributed to a towering \u00a37bn of one-off costs, including \u00a34.7bn relating to revaluation of properties because of poorer trading and lower profits.. After years of growth in the UK, Tesco suffered five profit warnings last year as analysts said it had opened too many large stores, let prices rise and shop floor standards slip. All supermarkets are under pressure as shoppers switch to the internet, small local shops and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, but Tesco has been hardest hit as a result of its scale. Lewis, who has never run a retailer before, was brought in to provide a fresh approach. Soon after his arrival, Lewis uncovered the accounting scandal caused by overoptimistic recording of payments made to Tesco by suppliers. The scandal has led to several executive departures and investigations by the Serious Fraud Office, the accountancy watchdog and the supermarket regulator. On Wednesday, Tesco said it had found about \u00a360m more in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations. Lewis said that Tesco had sought to \u201cdraw a line under the past\u201d with the massive writedowns and was beginning to see \u201cearly encouraging signs\u201d of an upturn. In the three months to 28 February the volume of items sold in Tesco stores increased for the first time in four years. \u201cThe most important vital sign is that more people are coming in and there are more transactions. That\u2019s pretty good but it\u2019s just the start. There is so much more to do,\u201d Lewis said. He added customers were returning because Tesco has cut prices, is simplifying its ranges and improving service in stores. While management roles have gone, Lewis has put an additional 4,652 staff on to the shop floor to ensure shelves are well stocked and customers served better. City analysts welcomed the signs of green shoots. Bruno Monteyne, of Bernstein Research, said: \u201cDave Lewis has made the right initial steps on the long journey to potentially stabilising the company, and we believe Tesco has a fighting chance of regaining some of its former glories: a fantastic operator chasing cash returns to investors rather than global domination.\u201d But the annual financial results made clear the scale of the challenge for Lewis. Group sales fell 3% and trading profit, which excludes the impact of one-off costs, dived by 58% to \u00a31.4bn. Trade at established UK stores improved in recent months, but sales still slid 1% in the final quarter compared to 3.6% for the year as a whole. The problems were not just confined to the ailing UK business. Sales and profits dived in Asia and central Europe as Tesco, like many of its rivals, also faces competition from Aldi and Lidl in other markets. It has also run into local political and regulatory issues. Tesco also revealed it would have to pay \u00a3270m a year into its pension fund to help tackle a \u00a33.9bn deficit. The company did not rule out an additional one-off payment if necessary. Tesco shares fell nearly 5% to 223p, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, as Lewis admitted that the results could get worse still before they get better. Equalling last year\u2019s \u00a31.4bn operating profit level was only an \u201caspiration\u201d, he said. Hitting that target would be tough because Tesco was likely to have to slash prices further in the UK while legislation changes in Hungary had effectively wiped out profits in one of its biggest European markets. Analysts said Tesco had invested about \u00a3200m into cutting prices and improving service in the past year. Lewis said he was ready to go further to ensure Tesco remained competitive. \u201cIf we need to invest more in order to continue the momentum we will,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cIt won\u2019t be a big bang, it will be about constantly improving what we do.\u201d In the UK, only the Tesco Express convenience stores achieved sales growth at established stores. The grocer\u2019s Extra hypermarkets, superstores and smaller city centre Metro outlets all experienced a decline in sales amid a dramatic switch in consumer shopping habits. But Lewis insisted that the days of massive supermarkets were not numbered. He said that Tesco\u2019s largest outlets had improved trading year-on-year at a much faster rate than its other stores. \u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t dinosaurs,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople talk about the trend to convenience and link that to convenience stores \u2026 actually the most convenient thing for a person to do is go to one place and buy everything they want.\u201d While at least one analyst has suggested that Tesco should close as many as 200 more stores on top of the 43 it shuttered earlier this month, Lewis said he believed he could turn around performance by improving prices, choice and service. He said Tesco could and should be able to rebuild its profit margins in the UK to \u201cabove average industry margins\u201d \u2013 somewhere between 4% and 5% \u2013 from almost zero last year. Lewis admitted he could not say how long the rebuild would take and that performance in the year ahead could be volatile and bumpy. \u201cIt has been a very difficult year for Tesco. The results we have published today reflect a deterioration in the market and, more significantly, an erosion of our competitiveness over recent years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe market is still challenging and we are not expecting any letup in the months ahead. When you add to this the fundamental changes we are making to our business and our offer, it is likely to lead to an increased level of volatility in short-term performance.\u201d There was some disappointment in the City as Tesco failed to provide further news on the sale of assets or a potential rights issue in order to reduce its debts. Lewis played down the need for urgent action or a fire sale, even though ratings agencies reduced the company to \u201cjunk\u201d status. Lewis would only say that progress on the divestment of the Dunnhumby data analytics firm behind Tesco\u2019s loyalty card scheme was progressing to plan.",

But the former Unilever executive insisted the supermarket was on the road to recovery after a tough 2014 in which it suffered a \u00a3263m accounting scandal and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/21/tesco-ousts-philip-clarke-after-profit-warning\">exit of the former chief executive, Philip Clarke</a>, following slumping sales and profits.</p> <p>\u201cThis patient is okay \u2026 Our job is to allow it to be healthier. There is nothing critical about its finances,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The far worse than expected loss in the year to 28 February was revealed as the retailer confirmed it had axed nearly 5,000 head officeand UK store management jobs as well as more than 4,000 roles overseas and at the group\u2019s banking division. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/28/tesco-names-43-stores-to-close\">A further 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 43 Tesco stores earlier this month</a>.</p> <p>The \u00a3416m cost of those redundancies contributed to a towering \u00a37bn of one-off costs, including \u00a34.7bn relating to revaluation of properties because of poorer trading and lower profits..</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2015/apr/22/tesco-dave-lewis-results-shareholder-wrath\">Tesco boss must use 'honeymoon' to get results or face shareholder wrath</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After years of growth in the UK, Tesco suffered five profit warnings last year as analysts said it had opened too many large stores, let prices rise and shop floor standards slip. All supermarkets are under pressure as shoppers switch to the internet, small local shops and discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, but Tesco has been hardest hit as a result of its scale. Lewis, who has never run a retailer before, was brought in to provide a fresh approach.<br></p> <p>Soon after his arrival, Lewis uncovered the accounting scandal caused by overoptimistic recording of payments made to Tesco by suppliers. The scandal has led to several executive departures and investigations by the Serious Fraud Office, the accountancy watchdog and the supermarket regulator. On Wednesday, Tesco said it had found about \u00a360m more in mis-statements from previous years, mostly as a result of an audit of its Irish operations.</p> <p>Lewis said that Tesco had sought to \u201cdraw a line under the past\u201d with the massive writedowns and was beginning to see \u201cearly encouraging signs\u201d of an upturn. In the three months to 28 February the volume of items sold in Tesco stores increased for the first time in four years.</p> <p>\u201cThe most important vital sign is that more people are coming in and there are more transactions. That\u2019s pretty good but it\u2019s just the start. There is so much more to do,\u201d Lewis said.</p> <p>He added customers were returning because Tesco has cut prices, is simplifying its ranges and improving service in stores. While management roles have gone, Lewis has put an additional 4,652 staff on to the shop floor to ensure shelves are well stocked and customers served better.</p> <p>City analysts welcomed the signs of green shoots. Bruno Monteyne, of Bernstein Research, said: \u201cDave Lewis has made the right initial steps on the long journey to potentially stabilising the company, and we believe Tesco has a fighting chance of regaining some of its former glories: a fantastic operator chasing cash returns to investors rather than global domination.\u201d</p> <p>But the annual financial results made clear the scale of the challenge for Lewis. Group sales fell 3% and trading profit, which excludes the impact of one-off costs, dived by 58% to \u00a31.4bn. Trade at established UK stores improved in recent months, but sales still slid 1% in the final quarter compared to 3.6% for the year as a whole.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbc4efdf88fe6befcfa276873146bc493dc3a8ee\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/22/1429681012951/974a3940-80f7-4618-8a55-dfe0013588cc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis is tasked with turning around the company's fortunes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis is tasked with turning around the company\u2019s fortunes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The problems were not just confined to the ailing UK business. Sales and profits dived in Asia and central Europe as Tesco, like many of its rivals, also faces competition from Aldi and Lidl in other markets. It has also run into local political and regulatory issues. Tesco also revealed it would have to pay \u00a3270m a year into its pension fund to help tackle a \u00a33.9bn deficit. The company did not rule out an additional one-off payment if necessary.</p> <p>Tesco shares fell nearly 5% to 223p, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100, as Lewis admitted that the results could get worse still before they get better. Equalling last year\u2019s \u00a31.4bn operating profit level was only an \u201caspiration\u201d, he said. Hitting that target would be tough because Tesco was likely to have to slash prices further in the UK while legislation changes in Hungary had effectively wiped out profits in one of its biggest European markets.</p> <p>Analysts said Tesco had invested about \u00a3200m into cutting prices and improving service in the past year. Lewis said he was ready to go further to ensure Tesco remained competitive. \u201cIf we need to invest more in order to continue the momentum we will,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cIt won\u2019t be a big bang, it will be about constantly improving what we do.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, only the Tesco Express convenience stores achieved sales growth at established stores. The grocer\u2019s Extra hypermarkets, superstores and smaller city centre Metro outlets all experienced a decline in sales amid a dramatic switch in consumer shopping habits.</p> <p>But Lewis insisted that the days of massive supermarkets were not numbered. He said that Tesco\u2019s largest outlets had improved trading year-on-year at a much faster rate than its other stores. \u201cMaybe they aren\u2019t dinosaurs,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople talk about the trend to convenience and link that to convenience stores \u2026 actually the most convenient thing for a person to do is go to one place and buy everything they want.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2015/apr/22/tesco-loss-dave-lewis-greece-bailout-eurozone-live\">Tesco urged to shut more stores after record \u00a36.38bn loss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While at least one analyst has suggested that Tesco should close as many as 200 more stores on top of the 43 it shuttered earlier this month, Lewis said he believed he could turn around performance by improving prices, choice and service.<br></p> <p>He said Tesco could and should be able to rebuild its profit margins in the UK to \u201cabove average industry margins\u201d \u2013 somewhere between 4% and 5% \u2013 from almost zero last year.</p> <p>Lewis admitted he could not say how long the rebuild would take and that performance in the year ahead could be volatile and bumpy. </p> <p>\u201cIt has been a very difficult year for Tesco. The results we have published today reflect a deterioration in the market and, more significantly, an erosion of our competitiveness over recent years,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cThe market is still challenging and we are not expecting any letup in the months ahead. When you add to this the fundamental changes we are making to our business and our offer, it is likely to lead to an increased level of volatility in short-term performance.\u201d</p> <p>There was some disappointment in the City as Tesco failed to provide further news on the sale of assets or a potential rights issue in order to reduce its debts. Lewis played down the need for urgent action or a fire sale, even though ratings agencies <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/14/tesco-supermarket-credit-rating-standard-and-poors\">reduced the company to \u201cjunk\u201d status</a>. Lewis would only say that progress on the divestment of the Dunnhumby data analytics firm behind Tesco\u2019s loyalty card scheme was progressing to plan.</p>",
