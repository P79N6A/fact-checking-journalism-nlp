      "bodyText": "The weird thing about the removal of Dalton Philips as chief executive of Morrisons is that no one seems to think that his strategy \u2013 to cut prices, even if that means lower profits \u2013 is the wrong one. Not even Andy Higginson, the former Tesco boss and new Morrisons chairman, who swung the axe. Higginson went out of his way to insist that Philips \u2013 who unveiled his plan last March to pour \u00a31bn into cutting prices over the coming three years \u2013 was on the right road. But although Philips was first with the big cuts, he was too late. Morrisons\u2019 Christmas sales were down 3.1% \u2013 worse than Tesco and Sainsbury. It takes six months to a year for customers who do not normally shop in a store to recognise a change in pricing. And Philips\u2019 Match &amp; More loyalty card, which matches prices at Aldi as well as Morrison\u2019s traditional rivals and was supposed to ram home the new price credentials, is too complicated at a time when shoppers increasingly just want clear, and cheaper, pricing. And Philips made just too many mis-steps before arriving at the correct conclusion. He wasted time and money buying an online childrenswear business and a stake in a New York internet grocer in a bid to learn how to launch a UK online food operation, eventually doing a deal with Ocado. He tried to take Morrisons upmarket, when what shoppers wanted was more basic, cheaper shops, like Aldi. He opened a batch of convenience stores, only to later have to close some, admitting they were in the wrong locations. He boasted that sales would turn positive over Christmas 2013 \u2013 but delivered a shocking 6% downturn. The shares, 300p when he took over and 300p in September 2013, had dropped to 152p a year later. With that history, Morrisons needed not to be the worst performer over Christmas if the boss was to keep his job. On Tuesday, as he was pointed to the checkout, the shares rose 4% to 184p. So now Higginson must find a new chief executive, to pursue pretty much the same strategy but without the mistakes. He does not want, he said, someone with L-plates \u2013 possibly a sideswipe at Tesco\u2019s decision to hire non-retailer Dave Lewis. There are many potential candidates: Jim McCarthy of Poundland, TalkTalk\u2019s Dido Harding, Monsoon\u2019s John Browett, Brakes\u2019 Ken McMeikan \u2013 all former Tesco and/or Sainsbury\u2019s executives. Or maybe Kate Swann, who demonstrated how to run a business on tight margins and with declining sales at WHSmith. Only one thing is certain: it will be a tough gig. Analyst predicts a riot There are bears. There are \u00fcberbears. And then there\u2019s Albert Edwards of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Financial markets always have a resident Dr Doom, the analyst who can always find a reason to be miserable. It was once Tony Dye of UBS; now it\u2019s Edwards, who outlined his thoughts for 2015 to a packed house in London\u2019s West End on Tuesday. The theme was summed up by the title of his presentation: \u201c2015 looks set to be the year deflation overwhelms the west. Markets set to riot.\u201d This, it hardly need be said, is a minority view. The consensus is that while the eurozone is struggling and Japan\u2019s emergence from deflation is proving more protracted than expected, the signs from elsewhere are more promising. The US is seeing solid growth and decent levels of job creation; Beijing seems to be in control of China\u2019s economic slowdown; and plunging oil prices reflect an oversupply of crude rather than a lack of demand. The expectation, therefore, is that the US Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates in mid-2015. Investors are anticipating that stronger growth and higher borrowing costs will lead to a sell off in US Treasury bonds, just as they were a year ago. Edwards takes a different view. He thinks China\u2019s growth is much weaker than the official figures suggest. He is not convinced that the drop in the cost of crude from $115 a barrel to a little over $45 a barrel is simply the result of US shale and Saudi overproduction, pointing out that iron ore prices have collapsed as well. He thinks the US economic cycle is at a relatively advanced stage and says whole-economy non-financial profits have come down with a bump. Japan will use a cheaper yen to flood the world with cheap goods and China will be forced to respond. The hit to US profits will lead to firms cutting investment and, as in the past, this will be the trigger for recession. Shares will suffer and bond prices will rise. Critics of Edwards say he is like a stopped clock, bound to be right sooner or later, and there is something in this. It is always possible to find the data to support a view, whether bullish or bearish, if you are smart enough. The sky has not fallen in, despite the repeated warnings that it is about to do so. Even so, Edwards has a point. The three things that normally get the global economy out of a hole are time, policy easing and falling commodity prices. It is getting on for eight years since the start of the financial crisis, long enough in the past for the healing process to be complete. The policy response by central banks and finance ministries has been unprecedented. Oil prices have fallen by $70 a barrel in six months. If all that doesn\u2019t work, we really are in trouble.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "For years it was as if they were flying on Ch\u00e2teau Lafite. The dizzying price of fuel was a curse on airline profits and executives searched for ways to save every drop, from towing planes to the runway and tweaking wing designs to curbing passengers\u2019 oversized baggage. Many slapped a hefty fuel surcharge on the price of their tickets. But with the oil price dropping into the Asti Spumante realm, are passengers going to see cheaper fares to match? Certainly some think they should \u2013 not least one Twitter user, a certain @George_Osborne. Last week the chancellor made headlines by tweeting: \u201cOil price was $53 pbl last night \u2013 lowest in 5yrs. Vital this is passed on to families at petrol pumps, through utility bills and air fares.\u201d A week on, oil is 10% cheaper and the pressure growing. The inclusion of airlines alongside businesses that directly sell fuel to consumers smacks of slight mischief-making from a chancellor who might be pleased to keep airlines off his back with their complaints about air passenger duty. As one British airline chief executive is understood to have told Osborne directly, the savings on jet fuel bills are \u2013 for now \u2013 a fraction of the fall in the price of a barrel of Brent crude. The good news for the flying public is fares are likely to fall. The bad news is by nowhere near as much as the oil drop might imply \u2013 and not very soon. Fuel has been the biggest single cost for most airlines, the one price largely out of their control, and a factor that has driven several to the wall. After around three decades of relatively stable and benign prices, the spike and plunge in the price of oil in 2008 \u2013 when Brent jumped to an all-time high of $145 a barrel in July before plunging to $40 by Christmas \u2013 has been followed by years when $100-plus prices have been the norm. Fuel bills reached a third of average airline costs, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata). To avoid the price extremes, the bigger airlines are all hedged, forward buying most of the fuel they expect to consume in 2015 and beyond, at prices well above the current market rate. In the short term, that looks a costly insurance given the dramatic fall in fuel prices, but few airlines would change the practice. Analyst John Strickland said: \u201cThey want certainty. That gives them the ability to manage their business and know what their costs will be.\u201d Removing the fuel surcharge now would be risky, he said. \u201cSome airlines like Monarch aren\u2019t fully hedged, but the likes of IAG are precommitted at prices a lot higher \u2013 they\u2019re not in a position to take their charges off.\u201d IAG, the airline group that owns British Airways, is explicit: it is not planning to cut its fuel surcharges, which can add almost \u00a3500 to a return trip to Sydney in premium economy. It argues that surcharges have yet to recover airlines\u2019 additional fuel costs since the last decade, and recent fuel savings have been offet by the strength of the US dollar, in which oil is purchased. According to analyst Andrew Lobbenberg of HSBC, it means in the short term lower fuel bills will improve airline profits far more modestly than the drop in the price of Brent crude suggests. The 52% fall in the last six months, he calculates, only translates into a current 10% savings for airlines such as IAG. While jet fuel prices roughly track crude historically, they have not dropped quite as rapidly. Hedging means IAG has bought 74% of its jet fuel for the year ahead. Throw in the strong dollar, and the savings are a fraction of what they first appear. Lobbenberg said: \u201cOver the past month the underlying impact is around 3%, compared to the headline 24% drop in crude.\u201d Virgin Atlantic has slightly cut its fuel surcharge in recent weeks; easyJet and Ryanair do not impose fuel surcharges. Ryanair will pay approximately $93 per barrel for 90% of its fuel in 2015-16 and estimates that it will cut just 4% of its fuel costs. Around 20% of the first half of the next year\u2019s requirements are now locked in, at a slightly better price. For some global flyers, an imminent decrease in fares is likely: Japanese and Chinese airlines have cut surcharges, and Iata predicts a 5.1% average fall across the industry during 2015. Certainly, Iata predicts stronger airline profits \u2013 a cumulative $25bn \u2013 on the back of cheaper oil. But it added: \u201cThe industry is not yet delivering a sustainable return to its investors of 7%. We\u2019re not yet at the level where we need to be: there is pressure on airlines to return money to investors.\u201d From a shareholder point of view, analysts also see more clouds than silver linings. Lobbenberg noted: \u201cOn a mid to long-term basis the impact is less benign. A sustained lower oil price will likely weaken capacity discipline and delay industry restructuring.\u201d What\u2019s bad for airline stocks may prove good for passengers though. Even if some major airlines are in no mood, or position, to cut surcharges, the smaller and weaker players, which are less likely to have hedged, will survive and lay on more flights that would have been marginal before. That means more seats available which should drive down prices. As one analyst, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: \u201cFuel hedging smooths out and slows down the pace of change, and gives business stability.\u201d But why are the airlines keen to tell how much over the odds they have paid? \u201cIt\u2019s their justification for not bringing prices down.\u201d Lobbenberg said: \u201cThe effect of hedging is not to lose the benefit of falling fuel prices, but to rather delay the benefit.\u201d It could be two years before the direct effects of cheaper fuel are passed on to the customer.",

      "bodyText": "Cheaper petrol but higher insurance premiums for motorists It doesn\u2019t take a rocket-fuel scientist to see that an early consequence of a fall in the price of crude oil will \u2013 eventually \u2013 be cheaper petrol, which is plainly good news for motorists. According to the RAC Foundation, Britain\u2019s drivers spent an estimated \u00a32.57bn on fuel last month, about \u00a3330m less than they spent in July, when crude oil was still trading at over $100 a barrel. In research done for the Sunday Telegraph, the foundation calculates that the owners of Britain\u2019s 28m cars should save around \u00a34bn this year, compared with what they would have spent had petrol prices stayed at last summer\u2019s level of \u00a31.33 a litre \u2013 about \u00a3140 per motorist. (And that\u2019s based on petrol prices sticking where they are now; they could yet fall further.) But it\u2019s not all good news. Because what will motorists do with the extra cash burning a hole in their pockets? Drive more miles, for one thing. And driving more miles means spending more time on the road, which will almost inevitably lead to more accidents. And more accidents lead to \u2026 higher insurance premiums. In fact, this phenomenon seems already to be happening: according to research carried out jointly by the comparison website confused.com and consultants Towers Watson, although the price of the average car insurance premium fell by \u00a351 overall last year, it rose by 2%, or about \u00a312, in the final quarter \u2013 partly because with petrol prices now 20% lower than during the summer, people were making more use of their cars. Stephen Jones, UK head of property and casualty pricing at Towers Watson, says the past three months of the year were driven by \u201cfalling fuel prices leading to increased driving [and] increasing accident frequency\u201d. Britain\u2019s drivers clocked up 77.9bn miles in the final three months of 2014, around 2.2% more than in the same quarter of the previous year, according to the British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), and logically, the number of insurance claims they submitted followed the same curve. Jon Henley More new cars hitting the road Along with other factors including greater confidence in the economy, lower petrol prices may also tempt more people into buying a new car. The SMMT reported that nearly 2.5m new cars were registered in 2014, the highest level in a decade and nearly 10% more than in 2013. According to the Department for Transport, there were around 525,000 more cars \u2013 almost 2% of the total \u2013 on Britain\u2019s roads at the end of last year compared with the end of 2013. And the New Year seems to have got off to a similar start: the car sales website motors.co.uk says the first 10 days of 2015 \u201chit record levels on all key metrics\u201d. Page views for premium brands such as BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Jaguar and Land Rover have more than trebled, the company says, adding that it attributes the exceptional start to the year to \u201ca combination of an improving economy and the lower cost of fuel\u201d. But SMMT spokesman Ben Foulds says it is far too soon for the automotive industry to start making assumptions about changes in the kind of cars people will want to buy, or manufacturers to make. \u201cWe don\u2019t see much effect in the short to medium term,\u201d he says. \u201cConsumers may have a bit more money in their pockets and confidence in terms of spending, but the industry now is about fuel economy and efficiency and the increases have been considerable.\u201d That focus is not about to change soon, Foulds suggests \u2013 adding that Jaguar\u2019s much talked-about first SUV, the monster F-Pace unveiled at the Detroit motor show, \u201cwill have been in planning for a matter of years\u201d. JH Russian tourism dries up In recent years, Russian tourists have joined ranks with the Chinese to become major cash cows for holiday destinations around the world. With the conflict in Ukraine, subsequent sanctions from the west and a drop in the value of the rouble, their numbers are already in decline. The drop in oil prices will only add to this. \u201cEconomic growth might be dented in countries which are oil exporters,\u201d says John Kester, trend researcher at the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). \u201cThe Russias and the Nigerias of the world might see fewer people travelling.\u201d And this will have knock-on effects for the countries that traditionally host them. As Dr George Filis, associate professor in financial economics at Bournemouth University, explains: \u201cI\u2019m from Greece and one of our largest markets is Russian tourists. So if they stop coming, that could be quite damaging.\u201d Will Coldwell Airline profits on the rise The aviation industry has been struggling financially for years, particularly since 2010 when oil prices began to rise significantly. Margins and profits have been squeezed in order to keep ticket prices down. Now, as Filis explains, is a \u201cgolden opportunity for airlines to correct their balance sheets\u201d. In the short term, ticket prices are likely to remain the same, while airlines enjoy an increase in profits and happier shareholders. The fact that airlines make contracts for fuel months in advance of their needs will also delay any price changes. But if oil prices stay down throughout the year, consumers will start to see cheaper tickets. \u201cI would be extremely surprised if it doesn\u2019t eventually pass on to the passengers,\u201d says Filis. WC Cheaper flights to exotic, long-haul destinations The economic boost from lower oil prices should mean the UK public has a bit more disposable income to spend on holidays and, if there is an eventual reduction in travel costs, could be jetting off more readily to further-flung destinations. \u201cWhen oil prices are high it slightly encourages short haul flights,\u201d says Kester. \u201cAnd when they go down there\u2019s a slight swing towards long haul. But this is still balanced with exchange rates and other factors; often the cost of living in long haul destinations is relatively low while getting there is relatively expensive.\u201d In December, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), predicted the average return air fare, excluding taxes, would fall by 5.1% in 2015. Chris Goater, a spokesman for the organisation, acknowledges that there will be a time lag before consumers enjoy cheaper prices, but adds: \u201cThe airline industry is very competitive and airlines price aggressively in order to hold on to their market share. Consumers generally do very well out of the situation.\u201d WC Safer sex The shrivelling oil price has an unexpected bonus \u2013 cheaper and safer sex. A fall in the price of crude should result in cheaper condoms \u2013 or at least those made sythentically, from materials such as polyurethane, where the price is determined by the market price for oil. Sexual lubricants could become cheaper too \u2013 as \u201cmuch of the intimacy product market is still dominated by petrochemical- based products\u201d according to Wendy Strgar, -\u201cLoveologist\u201d at Good Clean Love. Patrick Collinson Cheaper mortgages, and more pain for savers in the UK The fall in the headline rate of inflation to its lowest ever level of just 0.5% \u2013 largely a result of the dramatic collapse in the price of crude \u2013 will benefit millions of homebuyers with \u201ctracker\u201d style mortgages, as the prospect of a rise in interest rates recedes by the day. Last year most economists thought interest rates would start to march back up again by the end of 2014. But it didn\u2019t happen, and now many expect them to remain at historically low levels long past the election and into 2016. Lenders have reacted by issuing some of the cheapest fixed-rate deals ever seen in Britain. Barclays has brought out a loan fixed for 10 years at just 2.99%, while HSBC is offering a two-year fix at just 1.29%. With some speculating that inflation could head to zero if the oil price continues to drop, expect more record low mortgages to follow. More money in buyers\u2019 pockets and cheap mortgages are usually the recipe for a property boom, yet virtually every major house price index is pointing downwards. Housing has cooled rapidly in recent months, especially in London, where the \u201cprime\u201d market is suffering with Russian oligarchs dependent on oil riches now short of a million or two to throw at a flat in Knightsbridge. But spare a thought for savers with ISAs, who outnumber mortgage holders seven-to-one \u2013 and can expect no early relief from years of paltry payouts. \u201cCash deposit rates are surely going to stay lower for longer as a result of falling inflation. The governor of the Bank of England is highly unlikely to raise rates while at the same time writing a letter to the chancellor to explain why inflation is so far below target. Short term, savers have little choice but to grin and bear it,\u201d says Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. PC Saudi Arabia keeps the squeeze on Iran Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer and exporter, is also regional standard-bearer for the majority Sunni Muslim branch of Islam. The Saudis\u2019 big rival is majority Shia Muslim Iran, with which it is embroiled in a proxy war for power and influence across the Middle East. The Saudis, emboldened by nearly $1tn in cash reserves, have consistently refused to prop up the plunging oil price by cutting production. Their motive, at least in part, may be a deliberate attempt to squeeze the Iranian economy and weaken Tehran\u2019s clerical regime. About 60% of Iran\u2019s exports are tied to oil. Some analysts suggest the Saudis are in cahoots with the US, which (with the EU) has imposed tough sanctions on Iran over its alleged covert effort to acquire nuclear weapons capability. Barack Obama, overriding Israel\u2019s objections and eager for a diplomatic coup before he steps down, is pursuing a nuclear pact with Iran; the deadline is July. Oil price pressure may be one way of forcing a deal. The Saudis have additional objectives. With Qatar, they want to neutralise Iran\u2019s support for the Assad regime in Syria, which they deplore. They also want to reduce Iranian influence with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shia groups in Bahrain, Yemen and elsewhere. Iran is undoubtedly feeling the pressure. It warned on Tuesday that the Saudis and oil-rich allies such as Kuwait were making a \u201cstrategic mistake\u201d that they would come to regret. Simon Tisdall Russia pulls even further away from Europe The falling oil price has severely damaged President Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime in Russia, which is heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues and cannot balance its budget at current prices. Putin has already signalled public sector wage freezes and spending cuts. The economy is set to shrink by 5% as the rouble\u2019s value falls and consumer prices rise. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine last year provoked western sanctions, exacerbating economic problems. Putin\u2019s generally more aggressive geopolitical stance vis a vis Nato and the west has also raised anxiety levels in Washington. As with Iran, it is suggested the US and Saudi Arabia have colluded on oil to punish Russia over Ukraine, curb future expansionism, and weaken its support for Syria\u2019s Assad. There is a precedent. In 1998, the Saudis, resentful of Russian competition, sent the oil price plummeting; Russia defaulted on its debts. Russia currently has about $400bn in reserves, but private sector debt amounts to about $700bn. If Russia is squeezed enough, it is argued, Putin may back down on Ukraine. But don\u2019t hold your breath. The Russian leader says the answer is to diversify the Russian economy away from oil. He has also begun to woo China with multi-billion dollar energy deals. This eastwards \u201cpivot\u201d could have long-term strategic implications for Russia\u2019s relations with Europe and US, forcing two of the world\u2019s most authoritarian regimes into alliance. ST Woes for Venezuela, Cuba and Brazil Venezuela, a leading oil exporter and champion of populist, leftwing politics across Latin America, has been badly hit, and has predictably blamed its plight on a US-led conspiracy. Given its sharp ideological differences with Washington, this claim is not beyond the realms of possibility. Venezuela has long helped bankroll Cuba\u2019s economy, for example, sending 80,000 barrels of oil daily. Oil makes up 95% of Venezuela\u2019s exports. According to market analysts, political instability coupled with economic woes could lead Caracas to default. Beleaguered Cuba, meanwhile, had little choice but to cut a deal with the old enemy, Washington, which it duly did last month. One unexpected result: demand for embargoed Cuban cigars in the US is set to boom. For other developing countries, the oil price fall could prove a mixed blessing. Brazil\u2019s rapid economic advance has been checked. But impoverished Chad, for example, is planning to double production this year. Like other smaller producers, it says incentives for a healthy diversification of the economy have grown. ST Boko Haram and Islamic State terror threat grows Nigeria\u2019s exports are almost entirely oil-related. Its currency lost 13% of its value in 2014 due to falling prices. Reduced government income will inevitably affect Nigeria\u2019s already limited ability to counter the Islamist extremists of Boko Haram, whose civilian atrocities have plumbed new depths. Deepening poverty, lack of education and unemployment, exacerbated by falling state revenues from oil, have serious implications for terrorism and stability elsewhere in the Sahel region, in Sudan and South Sudan, and in energy-rich Libya, scene of growing anarchy since the western intervention in 2011. Worse still, Islamic State terrorists in Iraq have seized oilfields and profited from illicit sales. For them, the windfall price is largely immaterial. Not so the Kurds of northern Iraq. Aspirations for Kurdish self-rule or independence may have been set back by falling revenues. ST Bad news for the SNP and frackers \u2022 The falling oil price has blown an enormous hole in Alex Salmond\u2019s economic prospectus for an independent Scotland. If the Scots had voted \u2018yes\u2019 last autumn, they might now be looking at a \u00a315.5bn shortfall. \u2022 Continuing low oil prices could help defuse a new conflict between Britain and Argentina over the Falklands (Malvinas) islands. Exploiting disputed offshore fields there may prove uneconomic. \u2022 Something similar may happen to the so-called shale gas revolution. Low prices have undermined the already established shale gas industry in the US. If they persist, they may kill off controversial fracking plans in the UK. ST",

But if oil prices stay down throughout the year, consumers will start to see cheaper tickets. \u201cI would be extremely surprised if it doesn\u2019t eventually pass on to the passengers,\u201d says Filis. <strong>WC</strong></p> <h2><p><strong>Cheaper flights to exotic, long-haul destinations</strong></p></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a18b3634fdd295d1bfaf9b7208ba90e48251476\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/13/1421169209314/35fca89a-744f-4cd7-91a5-05e68b9430b1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"British airways flight\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ticket prices should eventually fall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antony Nettle / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The economic boost from lower oil prices should mean the UK public has a bit more disposable income to spend on holidays and, if there is an eventual reduction in travel costs, could be jetting off more readily to further-flung destinations. \u201cWhen oil prices are high it slightly encourages short haul flights,\u201d says Kester. \u201cAnd when they go down there\u2019s a slight swing towards long haul. But this is still balanced with exchange rates and other factors; often the cost of living in long haul destinations is relatively low while getting there is relatively expensive.\u201d In December, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), predicted the average return air fare, excluding taxes, would fall by 5.1% in 2015. Chris Goater, a spokesman for the organisation, acknowledges that there will be a time lag before consumers enjoy cheaper prices, but adds: \u201cThe airline industry is very competitive and airlines price aggressively in order to hold on to their market share. Consumers generally do very well out of the situation.\u201d <strong>WC</strong></p> <h2><strong>Safer sex</strong></h2> <p>The shrivelling oil price has an unexpected bonus \u2013 cheaper and safer sex. A fall in the price of crude should result in cheaper condoms \u2013 or at least those made sythentically, from materials such as polyurethane, where the price is determined by the market price for oil. </p> <p>Sexual lubricants could become cheaper too \u2013 as \u201cmuch of the intimacy product market is still dominated by petrochemical- based products\u201d according to Wendy Strgar, -\u201cLoveologist\u201d at Good Clean Love. <strong>Patrick Collinson</strong> </p> <h2><strong>Cheaper mortgages, and more pain for savers in the UK</strong></h2> <p>The fall in the headline rate of inflation to its lowest ever level of just 0.5% \u2013 largely a result of the dramatic collapse in the price of crude \u2013 will benefit millions of homebuyers with \u201ctracker\u201d style mortgages, as the prospect of a rise in interest rates recedes by the day.<br></p> <p>Last year most economists thought interest rates would start to march back up again by the end of 2014. But it didn\u2019t happen, and now many expect them to remain at historically low levels long past the election and into 2016.</p> <p>Lenders have reacted by issuing some of the cheapest fixed-rate deals ever seen in Britain. Barclays has brought out a loan fixed for 10 years at just 2.99%, while HSBC is offering a two-year fix at just 1.29%. With some speculating that inflation could head to zero if the oil price continues to drop, expect more record low mortgages to follow.</p> <p>More money in buyers\u2019 pockets and cheap mortgages are usually the recipe for a property boom, yet virtually every major house price index is pointing downwards. Housing has cooled rapidly in recent months, especially in London, where the \u201cprime\u201d market is suffering with Russian oligarchs dependent on oil riches now short of a million or two to throw at a flat in Knightsbridge.</p> <p>But spare a thought for savers with ISAs, who outnumber mortgage holders seven-to-one \u2013 and can expect no early relief from years of paltry payouts. \u201cCash deposit rates are surely going to stay lower for longer as a result of falling inflation. The governor of the Bank of England is highly unlikely to raise rates while at the same time writing a letter to the chancellor to explain why inflation is so far below target. Short term, savers have little choice but to grin and bear it,\u201d says Laith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown. <strong>PC</strong></p> <h2><strong>Saudi Arabia keeps the squeeze on Iran</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d41e677b-fd12-4370-b452-ace1071e80c6\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/13/1421168483975/b19f99fd-2f7c-4211-bf72-83a69800f4b6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Khurais oil field in Saudi Arabia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An oil field in Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer and exporter which is seeing increased tensions with Iran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ali Haider/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer and exporter, is also regional standard-bearer for the majority Sunni Muslim branch of Islam. The Saudis\u2019 big rival is majority Shia Muslim Iran, with which it is embroiled in a proxy war for power and influence across the Middle East. The Saudis, emboldened by nearly $1tn in cash reserves, have consistently refused to prop up the plunging oil price by cutting production. Their motive, at least in part, <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/2014/11/28/different-kind-oil-crisis-285331.html\">may be a deliberate attempt to squeeze the Iranian economy and weaken Tehran\u2019s clerical regime</a>. About 60% of Iran\u2019s exports are tied to oil.</p> <p>Some analysts suggest the Saudis are in cahoots with the US, which (with the EU) has imposed tough sanctions on Iran over its alleged covert effort to acquire nuclear weapons capability. Barack Obama, overriding Israel\u2019s objections and eager for a diplomatic coup before he steps down, is pursuing a nuclear pact with Iran; <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/11/cloneofiran-nuclear-talks-likely-adjourned-20141-2014112417038331438.html\">the deadline is July</a>. Oil price pressure may be one way of forcing a deal.</p> <p>The Saudis have additional objectives. With Qatar, they want to neutralise Iran\u2019s support for the Assad regime in Syria, which they deplore. They also want to reduce Iranian influence with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Shia groups in Bahrain, Yemen and elsewhere. Iran is undoubtedly feeling the pressure. It warned on Tuesday that the Saudis and oil-rich allies such as Kuwait <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/13/us-energy-iran-rouhani-idUSKBN0KM0PE20150113\">were making a \u201cstrategic mistake\u201d that they would come to regret</a>. <strong>Simon Tisdall</strong></p> <h2><p><strong>Russia pulls even further away from Europe</strong></p></h2> <p>The falling oil price has severely damaged President Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime in Russia, which is heavily dependent on oil and gas revenues and cannot balance its budget at current prices. Putin has already signalled public sector wage freezes and spending cuts. The economy is set to shrink by 5% as the rouble\u2019s value falls and consumer prices rise. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine last year provoked western sanctions, exacerbating economic problems. Putin\u2019s generally more aggressive geopolitical stance vis a vis Nato and the west has also raised anxiety levels in Washington.</p> <p>As with Iran, <a href=\"http://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Did-The-Saudis-And-The-US-Collude-In-Dropping-Oil-Prices.html\">it is suggested the US and Saudi Arabia have colluded on oil to punish Russia</a> over Ukraine, curb future expansionism, and weaken its support for Syria\u2019s Assad. There is a precedent. In 1998, the Saudis, resentful of Russian competition, sent the oil price plummeting; Russia defaulted on its debts. Russia currently has about $400bn in reserves, but private sector debt amounts to about $700bn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"024896b3e05dcca933df5796c0a878375130e837\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/13/1421168634050/49fc6783-6cb2-41c2-8d0e-8c6d636e1118-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"China's Shengli oil field\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">China\u2019s Shengli oil field: Russia is building an energy alliance with China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WU HONG/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Russia is squeezed enough, it is argued, Putin may back down on Ukraine. But don\u2019t hold your breath. The Russian leader says the answer is to diversify the Russian economy away from oil. He has also begun to woo China with multi-billion dollar energy deals. This eastwards \u201cpivot\u201d could have long-term strategic implications for Russia\u2019s relations with Europe and US, forcing two of the world\u2019s most authoritarian regimes into alliance.<strong> ST</strong></p> <h2><p><strong>Woes for Venezuela, Cuba and Brazil</strong></p></h2> <p>Venezuela, a leading oil exporter and champion of populist, leftwing politics across Latin America, has been badly hit, and has predictably blamed its plight on a US-led conspiracy. Given its sharp ideological differences with Washington, this claim is not beyond the realms of possibility.</p> <p>Venezuela has long helped bankroll Cuba\u2019s economy, for example, sending 80,000 barrels of oil daily. Oil makes up 95% of Venezuela\u2019s exports. According to market analysts, political instability coupled with economic woes could lead Caracas to default. Beleaguered Cuba, meanwhile, <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/cuba-didnt-have-a-choice-anymore-2014-12\">had little choice but to cut a deal with the old enemy</a>, Washington, which it duly did last month.

Brazil\u2019s rapid economic advance has been checked. But impoverished Chad, for example, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-2783431/Chad-double-oil-output-2016-develop-minerals-minister.html\">is planning to double production this year</a>.

Its currency lost 13% of its value in 2014 due to falling prices. Reduced government income will inevitably affect Nigeria\u2019s already limited ability to counter the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/boko-haram\">Islamist extremists of Boko Haram</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/09/boko-haram-deadliest-massacre-baga-nigeria\">whose civilian atrocities have plumbed new depths</a>.</p> <p>Deepening poverty, lack of education and unemployment, exacerbated by falling state revenues from oil, have serious implications for terrorism and stability elsewhere in the Sahel region, in Sudan and South Sudan, and in energy-rich Libya, scene of growing anarchy since the western intervention in 2011. Worse still, Islamic State terrorists in Iraq have seized oilfields and profited from illicit sales. For them, the windfall price is largely immaterial. Not so the Kurds of northern Iraq. Aspirations for Kurdish self-rule or independence may have been set back by falling revenues. <strong>ST</strong></p> <h2><p><strong>Bad news for the SNP and frackers</strong></p></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be29f989bc2cd9b05e72f824fbe62fa372aba3e8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/13/1421169039701/50527526-ee52-42a2-b127-69f01cabb13d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Scotland yes voters referendum\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If the Scots had voted \u2018yes\u2019, they might have faced a \u00a315.5bn shortfall in revenue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 The falling oil price has blown an enormous hole in <a href=\"http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/politics/alex-salmond/alex-salmond-interviews-the-oil-price-will-go-up-again-everybody-knows-that-1.779981\">Alex Salmond\u2019s economic prospectus for an independent Scotland</a>.

Kelvin exercised 202,382 nil paid options representing 0.46% of the business, and these were placed with investors at \u00a323 each to raise \u00a34.65m. In the market Ted Baker\u2019s shares have dropped 57p to \u00a323.08 on the news. The move still leaves Kelvin with a stake of 35.38%, as well as another 62,527 nil paid options under a long term incentive plan. Kelvin is believed to have placed the shares awarded to him rather than keeping them and increasing his stake, to help improve liquidity in the shares. Last week the company reported a strong Christmas, with sales up 22.8% in the eight weeks to January 3. Kelvin, who famously dislikes showing his face in public, turned the company from a shirt shop in Glasgow founded more than 25 years ago into a global business worth nearly \u00a3800m.",

Note from today\u2019s data that despite the sharp downward trajectory of the headline rate of inflation, the \u2018core\u2019 measure (i.e. CPI ex-food, energy, tobacco and alcoholic beverages) actually ticked up a touch to 1.3% from 1.2%.</p> <p>Our central call remains that the monetary policy committee will raise rates in August this year.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Berenberg Bank</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is very good news indeed for UK consumers and the UK economy.

We suspect that these views will gradually spread through the BoE as rising employment and strong growth offer reassurance on the UK\u2019s economic progress. Indeed, real household disposable incomes are likely to grow by around 3% this year as wage rises, tax changes and low inflation combine to create a more favourable environment for consumer spending.

But wages continue to be sluggish and the squeeze on living standards since 2010 means working people are \u00a31,600 a year worse off under this government. </p> <p>And falling energy costs are still not being fully passed on to consumers. That\u2019s why Labour will bring in new powers for the regulator to cut bills and force energy firms to pass on savings to consumers. We\u2019ll put our plan to a vote in parliament on Wednesday and urge Tory and Lib Dem MPs to drop their opposition to our reforms.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s economic plan will also ensure we earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top.

As a result businesses will feel a double impact of continued low borrowing costs, particularly for property, and the boost that real term wage growth can give the economy through enhanced consumer purchasing power. Both are key for a robust recovery and provide hope to consumer-dependant sectors such as grocery and clothing retail which are not yet enjoying the fruits of economic growth as much as some other sectors. </p> </blockquote>",

Shabana Mahmood, the Shadow Treasury minister Plummeting global oil prices are the reason why the rate of inflation is falling here in Britain. But wages continue to be sluggish and the squeeze on living standards since 2010 means working people are \u00a31,600 a year worse off under this government. And falling energy costs are still not being fully passed on to consumers. That\u2019s why Labour will bring in new powers for the regulator to cut bills and force energy firms to pass on savings to consumers. We\u2019ll put our plan to a vote in parliament on Wednesday and urge Tory and Lib Dem MPs to drop their opposition to our reforms. Labour\u2019s economic plan will also ensure we earn our way to higher living standards for all, not just a few at the top. Our plan to tackle the cost-of-living crisis and for more good jobs is also a key part of our tough but balanced plan to get the deficit down. Miles Gibson, Head of UK Research at CBRE Falling oil prices and gas and electricity costs being removed from the inflation calculation have all but ended the likelihood of a base rate rise before the end of this year. As a result businesses will feel a double impact of continued low borrowing costs, particularly for property, and the boost that real term wage growth can give the economy through enhanced consumer purchasing power. Both are key for a robust recovery and provide hope to consumer-dependant sectors such as grocery and clothing retail which are not yet enjoying the fruits of economic growth as much as some other sectors.",

The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, has also had a small bounce in the polls, with his approval rating up four points to 38%, and his dissatisfaction rating down six points to 33%. There has been little movement in the two-party preferred intentions, with Labor up two points to 54%, and the Coalition down by the same number to 46%.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers have suffered their toughest Christmas since the financial crisis struck, according to industry figures that showed sharp discounting continuing to take its toll. Capping a tough year on the high street, the value of December sales dropped by 0.4% on a year earlier in like-for-like terms, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) \u2013 the worst December performance since 2008, when sales had tumbled 3.3% in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers collapse. However, the trade group noted that food sales picked up in December, rising for the first time since April. There was also some support for non-food items in end-of-season sales. The figures came after mixed trading reports so far for the industry\u2019s most crucial month. Marks &amp; Spencer has admitted to a dismal Christmas, while Next and John Lewis saw strong sales. Debenhams and Morrisons update investors on Tuesday. The BRC director general, Helen Dickinson, talked about a \u201cpositive performance\u201d overall in December. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that targeted discounting has worked for the UK\u2019s retailers \u2013 prices have been cut just enough to encourage customers through the doors, but not so much that sales growth has been completely choked off,\u201d she said. The BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor showed there was a 1% rise in total sales, which are not adjusted to strip out the effect of changes in floor space as shops open and close. That was also the weakest December performance since 2008. David McCorquodale, head of retail at the report\u2019s co-authors, KPMG, highlighted the growing role discounting has played in the runup to Christmas. He said the US-inspired Black Friday of flash sales was followed by a \u201cchallenging lull in spending\u201d as consumers waited for future bargains. \u201cThis difficult stop/start sales environment has been undoubtedly challenging, but most retailers have managed to achieve a flat, but respectable, sales performance this Christmas. Time will tell on margins,\u201d he said. Economists have predicted some boost to consumer confidence from falling household costs, especially as petrol prices drop thanks to the sliding oil price. But they have also flagged up the election in May and uncertainty about the global economy as weighing on sentiment. Retail analysts have pointed out that even if sales pick up in volume in 2015, lower prices will put pressure on profits. McCorquodale predicted this year would bring more tough price competition between retailers, particularly supermarkets: \u201cThe big four grocers have already signalled they will cut prices to secure sales. Non-food retailers will fare better, but whilst consumer confidence remains fragile, these too are vulnerable to shocks, be they political or economic.\u201d The BRC report suggested some relief for food sellers before Christmas as they managed to stem the decline in sales. The like-for-like drop of 2.2% for October to December was the smallest drop in three-month average terms since the start of the summer. The BRC said seafood seemed particularly popular this Christmas and people were opting increasingly for premium ranges for their festive fare. The figures followed a separate report last week from the BRC showing that prices in UK shops fell in every month of 2014 and predicting that the falling price of oil and other commodities would continue the pattern in coming months. Official figures on Tuesday are expected to show that overall inflation fell to a 12-year low in December. After 1% inflation on the consumer prices index in November, the rate is predicted to drop to 0.7% for December after a utility bill freeze, the supermarket price war and cheaper petrol. Benign price pressures mean the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, is almost certain to have to write to the chancellor, George Osborne, explaining why inflation is so low. Under the Bank\u2019s remit, if inflation strays more than one percentage point in either direction from the 2.0% target, the governor must write explaining why, and what the central bank intends to do about it. All of the 14 letters written until now have been after inflation missed the target too far in the other direction, overshooting by more than 1 percentage point.",
