      "bodyText": "Howard Schultz, the founder and chief executive of Starbucks, wants to start a conversation about race. But even the baristas charged with engaging customers in the company\u2019s controversial #RaceTogether campaign near his childhood home in Canarsie, Brooklyn, aren\u2019t sure that\u2019s a good idea. \u201cYou might want to talk about racial issues if you\u2019re Caucasian, but it\u2019s more difficult if you\u2019re African-American,\u201d said one customer, Felicia Green, 25, who, like Schultz, attended Canarsie high school. At a Starbucks in Brooklyn\u2019s Kings Plaza mall, many felt that any such discussion would have to be addressed carefully \u2013 if at all. One barista, Michael, said he was concerned that \u201cpeople won\u2019t be able to take it ... they may be offended by the truth\u201d. This may be all part of the Frappuccino billionaire\u2019s plan. As the #RaceTogether campaign \u2013 under which employees will write the hashtag on coffee cups as an invitation to talk to them about race \u2013 was launched across the US on Friday, it was not clear how Schultz\u2019s vision of talk therapy for coffee consumers would play out. In Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron district, Schultz\u2019s pamphlets on the subject, stacked up on tables, were glanced over as curiosities and the chief executive\u2019s invocations were largely ignored. \u201cConversation has the power to change hearts and minds,\u201d wrote Schultz in a newspaper-sized pullout. Since announcing the initiative, the company and its founder have faced widespread criticism that \u2013 perhaps with the best of intentions \u2013 they are trying to reduce an incendiary issue to a marketing tagline. For its part, Starbucks insists #RaceTogether is not mandatory \u2013 neither customers nor employees have to engage in it. It is merely a suggestion, an invitation. If a customer asks, \u201ctry to engage them in a discussion,\u201d Schultz said. The 61-year-old\u2019s concern with a growing inequality of opportunity and what he calls the \u201cfracturing of the American dream\u201d echoes his own personal trajectory, which has taken him from a childhood in this poor part of Brooklyn to becoming one of America\u2019s wealthiest men, with a fortune of around $2.6bn (\u00a31.7bn). And Starbucks\u2019s brand narrative is closely tied to Schultz\u2019s story: he won an athletics scholarship to Northern Michigan University, worked in sales at Xerox, switched to a Swiss coffee-maker manufacturer, then jumped to a fledgling Seattle company \u2013 Starbucks \u2013 with the idea of replicating the Italian coffee house. But it was not until he returned to Starbucks in 2008, after an eight-year hiatus, that his engagement with political causes became more explicit. That engagement has led him to campaign on a range of issues. He pledged to hire 10,000 Iraq war veterans and military spouses over five years, and committed $30m to research on post-traumatic stress in veterans. In 2013, he led a petition urging Congress to end the government shutdown and wrote an open letter asking gun owners to refrain from bringing weapons into Starbucks \u2013 even if they were allowed to do so shops. When, at the firm\u2019s annual meeting two years ago, an investor complained that Starbucks\u2019s support for gay marriage in Washington state had harmed sales, Schultz invited him to divest his shares. \u201cThe divide between profitability and doing the right thing is collapsing,\u201d Schultz recently told the Seattle Times. He has said he is leading Starbucks \u201cto try to redefine the role and responsibility of a public company\u201d. But Starbucks stands out because many of the causes it addresses have little to do with its business. \u201cI don\u2019t know where this will go,\u201d Schultz told an employee forum on race relations in Seattle. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel, candidly, that just staying quiet as a company and staying quiet in this building is who we are and who I want us to be.\u201d Not all employees are happy to be burdened with the responsibilities of Schultz\u2019s \u201cconscious capitalism\u201d. Critics of Starbucks say the positions it adopts are platitudes that demand little from the company or customers in terms of identifying the specifics of an issue or concrete ways to address it. After #RaceTogether was unveiled, Corey duBrowa, Starbucks\u2019 director of global communications, received so many negative messages on Twitter that he deleted his account (he restored it a day later). Others found Schultz\u2019s call for \u201cone voice\u201d on the topic of race condescending. Kate Taylor, a writer for the business magazine Entrepreneur, wrote that Schultz could hardly paint himself as a \u201cvisionary progressive\u201d for discussing race when it is \u201csomething others, especially people of colour, haven\u2019t exactly been silent on in recent months or the last couple centuries\u201d. While good deeds offer some protection against fast-moving Twitter attacks and negative internet rumours, not all of Schultz\u2019s social programming has produced favourable publicity. Last year he announced Starbucks would become the first US company to provide free college tuition for all employees, or \u201cpartners\u201d as he prefers to call them. Critics, however, said the programmes were neither the first nor entirely free. Nor has Schultz, as the figurehead of a company associated with the imperial reach of US corporations, always been pitch-perfect overseas. In 2009, he drew the ire of then UK business secretary Peter Mandelson for saying Britain appeared to be \u201cspiralling\u201d. Mandelson retorted that it was Starbucks, not the UK, that \u201cis in a great deal of trouble\u201d. The company offered an apology, saying: \u201cWe are all in this together.\u201d Then, last year, Starbucks incurred the wrath of UK taxpayers when it revealed that it had paid only \u00a38.6m in tax since 1998. The company claimed it had not been profitable; critics say its receipts were being funnelled through the Netherlands and Switzerland. But could Schultz and the current generation of US corporate leaders give American capitalism a new face? Walter Robb, joint chief executive of food chain Whole Foods Market, told the Seattle Times: \u201cGovernment has shown its limits, and its inability to act in many cases; it\u2019s really incumbent on business to step up to a broader view of responsibility.\u201d But others warn that Starbucks\u2019s sense of righteousness could backfire. Business advisers warns that getting too involved in issues creates expectations that companies can\u2019t manage. \u201cYou\u2019re going to open the door to all kinds of people holding you to all kinds of different standards,\u201d said Nancy Koehn, a Harvard Business School professor. \u201cSmall things can trigger great rage.\u201d In the past, Starbucks has faced criticism over issues from the distribution of tips to plans to expand in Israel. Last year, it came under fire after the New York Times ran a profile of a barista who was struggling to meet a work timetable scheduled by a computer. But representing baristas as racial counsellors may not be as radical as it seems. Ever since he visited Italy and saw how Italians used coffee bars as \u201ca place for conversation and a sense of community\u201d, Schultz has pushed Starbucks to be more than a supplier of caffeine fixes. In the wake of the racial unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, he convened a discussion with employees in Seattle and in cities across the US. \u201cWe at Starbucks should be willing to talk about these issues in America,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cNot to point fingers or to place blame, and not because we have answers, but because staying silent is not who we are.\u201d Idealism, marketing or both? Schultz has never been demure about his achievements \u2013 he\u2019s published two books covering that ground intensively: Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time and Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life Without Losing Its Soul \u2013 and voiced some almost evangelical thinking. At the height of the company\u2019s expansion in 2005, Schultz told CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes: \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of filling bellies. We\u2019re in the business of filling souls.\u201d Still, Schultz\u2019s his call for chats about race over coffee may not reach low-income areas such as Canarsie. Despite complaints from the Canarsie Courier that Schultz has \u201cno problem caffeinating people\u201d in Kings Plaza, three miles away, there is still no branch of Starbucks here. Mr G, a resident of the racially diverse Bay View housing estate that the Schultz family once called home, says that, in neighbourhoods like this, a five-dollar cappuccino with a tiramisu topping is a luxury item, not a daily necessity. \u201cWe\u2019ve all heard about him here. We\u2019ve heard about the plan to write it on the cup. He wants to get people together. Could be good. He should put a Starbucks here. Yes sir.\u201d So why hasn\u2019t it happened? \u201cStarbucks is too white, and they charge too much damn money.\u201d BIG CHANGES Walmart Using a tactic familiar in the US labour movement - naming and shaming - campaigners pressed the supermarket chain on low pay, and in February Walmart announced that it would increase the wages of 500,000 of its staff to at least $9 (\u00a35.80) an hour: $1.75 above the federal minimum. KPMG The UK consultancy firm is a vocal supporter of the Living Wage Foundation and was one of the first big companies to support the campaign, back in 2005. Over 500 of its cleaners are now on the living wage, and staff turnover is down, as are recruitment and training costs. John Lewis The John Lewis Partnership employs more than 90,000 people and owns John Lewis and Waitrose.

      "body": "<p>The Great American Truffle Trademark War of 2015 proved to be short-lived, but, for entrepreneurs of all kinds who are trying to establish a brand, its legacy may linger.</p> <p>The David v Goliath struggle pitted tiny Boulder, Colorado, chocolatier Piece, Love &amp; Chocolate (14 employees, still \u201ctrying to make ends meet\u201d) and Chicago-based Vosges Haut-Chocolat (nine stores in cities like New York and Las Vegas, whose founder has been named Bon Appetit magazine\u2019s food artisan of the year and one of National Geographic\u2019s best chocolatiers of the year, among other honors). The latter has <a href=\"http://www.peaceloveandchocolate.com/\">a blog</a> named \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Peace Love &amp; Chocolate. True, that blog has only been updated five times in the last two years, but Vosges Haut-Chocolat\u2019s founder, Katrina Markoff, says she has been using the label to brand her chocolate products for about a decade.</p> <p>Some of Vosges\u2019s customers beg to differ. Among these: Sarah Amorese, founder of the small Boulder chocolate manufacturing and retailer, who occupies a 1,200 square foot store on Pearl Street and makes her own products as well as selling other gourmet brands. \u201cVosges Haut Chocolat doesn\u2019t use the phrase \u2018Peace, Love and Chocolate\u2019 in its name, logo or even advertising,\u201d Amorese pointed out in a heated post on her company\u2019s blog last month, igniting a war of words that pitted chocolate lovers against each other in cyberspace. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a phrase your legal team has trademarked as your \u2018mission\u2019 and happens to be the URL of your blog.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately there\u2019s nothing \u201csimple\u201d about that, as small business owners probably will learn as a result of the hullabaloo. Indeed, the Great Chocolate Trademark Tussle shows just how vital it is for an entrepreneur to focus not just on protecting his brilliant idea from rivals, but on making sure he isn\u2019t making any avoidable errors that are going to cost him tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road.</p> <p> \u201cThe reality is that most small businesses have limited resources and a lot of irons in the fire,\u201d says Brit Nelson, co-chair of the intellectual property practice group at Locke Lord. One of Nelson\u2019s clients, he says, has ended up as his client because he failed to do a basic search to see if anyone else was using the trademark that he wanted to use for his new business. \u201cHe was in a hurry to get his business up and running, to get the contract signed and get the revenue flowing; doing the background checks wasn\u2019t on his radar.\u201d He has since found out that there is another company with the same name, and it has cost him a lot of money (including Nelson\u2019s fees) and several years of goodwill associated with that name. All of which could have been avoided by investing a few hundred dollars up front.</p> <p> The controversy that followed Vosges\u2019s demand that Amorese cease and desist using the phrase that they had trademarked \u2013 and her <a href=\"https://pieceloveandchocolate.com/open-letter-katrina-markoff-vosges-haut-chocolat\">public and impassioned response</a> to Markoff \u2013 involved chocolate, but it proved to be anything but peaceful or lovely. Even fans of Vosges, reading Katrina Markoff\u2019s comments on the chocolate company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/VosgesChocolate/posts/10153139805584265\">Facebook page</a>, were far from united in their support of the bigger company. \u201cJust the fact that you initiated the legal action in this case will prevent me from ever enjoying your unique products again, which I knew only as Vosges,\u201d commented one (former) fan. \u201cI think it is a bit unfair, as it\u2019s not something I\u2019d ever know your chocolate for,\u201d added another.</p> <p> When it comes to David v Goliath intellectual property struggles, most of the time, entrepreneurs focus on protecting their ideas from poaching by their bigger rivals. Filing patents is the best-known approach, but it\u2019s far from the only one \u2013 and may not even be the best one in every circumstance. If you file a patent, you\u2019re disclosing your trade secret to the public in return for a limited monopoly. You might actually be better off simply <a href=\"http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/228302\">keeping it a secret</a>. A common mistake, says Nelson, is that entrepreneurs fail to get their employees, consultants, suppliers and business partners to sign necessary confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.</p> <p> Some businesses do try to survive without protecting their trade secrets. A case in point is Huy Fong Foods, whose Vietnamese-born owner, David Tran, <a href=\"http://www.daily-journal.com/life/food/even-without-a-trademark-siracha-creator-isn-t-sweating/article_bbc39293-c9ba-525f-83a9-f179dc6be962.html\">never trademarked the term Sriracha sauce</a>, enabling anyone who wants to try to compete with him to launch their own version of the fiery chili condiment.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the exception. And sometimes, as in the Chocolate Wars, it\u2019s the Goliath who feels hard done by, and the startup who not only needs to guard their own bright ideas, but make sure they don\u2019t jeopardize their future prospects by trespassing on the ideas of others.</p> <p> Consider North Face, which spent years trying to establish itself as an upscale and, yes, serious brand for affluent consumers. When Jimmy Winkelmann <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704895204575321230041321508\">launched his South Butt line of hoodies</a> and other garb (blatantly tweaking North Face\u2019s logo to look like, you guessed it, a butt), the two sides to that trademark dispute eventually reached an out-of-court agreement that enabled Winkelmann to keep selling his products. Apparently viewing this as encouragement, Winkelmann went on to found \u201cButt Face\u201d, which North Face didn\u2019t respond to any more favorably. In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/10/17/South%20Butt%20Consent.pdf\">a Missouri court ordered Winkelmann</a> to shut down his business immediately, stop parodying the company\u2019s products, destroy any stock and fork over $65,000 in damages.</p> <p>The Chocolate Wars, of course, weren\u2019t a deliberate parody, or even, according to Amorese\u2019s blog post, a deliberate usage of Vosges\u2019s trademark at all. But Nelson says that had the case ended up in court, it might have been tough for the smaller company to prevail. \u201cWhat\u2019s fair in life doesn\u2019t translate into a legal position,\u201d he says. Spelling the store\u2019s name with \u201cpiece\u201d instead of \u201cpeace\u201d and an ampersand in place of an \u201cand\u201d isn\u2019t enough to make them distinctive, and under trademark law, that\u2019s the key question, he says.

      "bodyText": "The Great American Truffle Trademark War of 2015 proved to be short-lived, but, for entrepreneurs of all kinds who are trying to establish a brand, its legacy may linger. The David v Goliath struggle pitted tiny Boulder, Colorado, chocolatier Piece, Love &amp; Chocolate (14 employees, still \u201ctrying to make ends meet\u201d) and Chicago-based Vosges Haut-Chocolat (nine stores in cities like New York and Las Vegas, whose founder has been named Bon Appetit magazine\u2019s food artisan of the year and one of National Geographic\u2019s best chocolatiers of the year, among other honors). The latter has a blog named \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Peace Love &amp; Chocolate. True, that blog has only been updated five times in the last two years, but Vosges Haut-Chocolat\u2019s founder, Katrina Markoff, says she has been using the label to brand her chocolate products for about a decade. Some of Vosges\u2019s customers beg to differ. Among these: Sarah Amorese, founder of the small Boulder chocolate manufacturing and retailer, who occupies a 1,200 square foot store on Pearl Street and makes her own products as well as selling other gourmet brands. \u201cVosges Haut Chocolat doesn\u2019t use the phrase \u2018Peace, Love and Chocolate\u2019 in its name, logo or even advertising,\u201d Amorese pointed out in a heated post on her company\u2019s blog last month, igniting a war of words that pitted chocolate lovers against each other in cyberspace. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a phrase your legal team has trademarked as your \u2018mission\u2019 and happens to be the URL of your blog.\u201d Unfortunately there\u2019s nothing \u201csimple\u201d about that, as small business owners probably will learn as a result of the hullabaloo. Indeed, the Great Chocolate Trademark Tussle shows just how vital it is for an entrepreneur to focus not just on protecting his brilliant idea from rivals, but on making sure he isn\u2019t making any avoidable errors that are going to cost him tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road. \u201cThe reality is that most small businesses have limited resources and a lot of irons in the fire,\u201d says Brit Nelson, co-chair of the intellectual property practice group at Locke Lord. One of Nelson\u2019s clients, he says, has ended up as his client because he failed to do a basic search to see if anyone else was using the trademark that he wanted to use for his new business. \u201cHe was in a hurry to get his business up and running, to get the contract signed and get the revenue flowing; doing the background checks wasn\u2019t on his radar.\u201d He has since found out that there is another company with the same name, and it has cost him a lot of money (including Nelson\u2019s fees) and several years of goodwill associated with that name. All of which could have been avoided by investing a few hundred dollars up front. The controversy that followed Vosges\u2019s demand that Amorese cease and desist using the phrase that they had trademarked \u2013 and her public and impassioned response to Markoff \u2013 involved chocolate, but it proved to be anything but peaceful or lovely. Even fans of Vosges, reading Katrina Markoff\u2019s comments on the chocolate company\u2019s Facebook page, were far from united in their support of the bigger company. \u201cJust the fact that you initiated the legal action in this case will prevent me from ever enjoying your unique products again, which I knew only as Vosges,\u201d commented one (former) fan. \u201cI think it is a bit unfair, as it\u2019s not something I\u2019d ever know your chocolate for,\u201d added another.
