      "bodyText": "The price of oil has fallen to its lowest level in 11 years as commodity markets responded to signs that the global glut of oil will deepen in 2016. Dealers said the cost of crude was on course in December to register its biggest monthly fall since the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers in October 2008. The latest fall in prices was prompted by concerns that a market already awash with oil from the two biggest suppliers \u2013 Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2013 would receive additional supply from the lifting of sanctions against Iran and the ending of a 40-year US export ban. In London, the price of benchmark Brent crude hit a low of $36.05 (\u00a324.22) a barrel on Monday, its lowest since 2004 and below the low point reached during the financial crisis of 2008-09. Oil prices were also on the slide in early trading on the other side of the Atlantic, with US light crude dipping below $34 a barrel to its lowest level in six years. While oil ministers from Qatar and Iraq sought to talk up the prospects of a recovery in the oil price, analysts said crude was likely to go lower in the short term, given that production is close to record levels at a time when demand has been affected by the slowdown in China and other leading emerging markets. Oil prices have slumped by a fifth since a meeting of the Opec cartel on 4 December failed to introduce any curbs on production, and are down by almost 40% in 2015 so far. Patricia Mohr, vice-president of cconomics and commoditymarket specialist at Scotiabank, said: \u201c2016 will remain challenging for most commodity producers \u2013 with global growth expected to remain lacklustre at best. In particular, competition in oil markets could intensify in the first half of 2016, as sanctions on Iran are lifted.\u201d She added that the cost of US crude had continued to drift lower following the Opec meeting, which came at the end of a year that has seen the cartel increase supply by 1.4m barrels a day. Mohr said the oil price could drop to $30 a barrel in the near term. \u201cUnlike previous experience, Opec did not even set a sales quota at the December meeting, with countries now largely producing at will,\u201d said Mohr. Iraq had increased production by 930,000 barrels a day since November 2014, while Saudi Arabia had supplied an additional 580,000 barrels a day. Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank senior manager, said: \u201cReally, I wouldn\u2019t like to be in the shoes of an oil exporter getting into 2016. It\u2019s not exactly looking as if there is light at the end of the tunnel any time soon.\u201d The investment bank Goldman Sachs has said that it could take a drop to as little as $20 a barrel for supply to adjust to demand. The lower cost of crude has dealt a blow to economies of oil producers such as Nigeria, which faces its worst crisis in years, and Venezuela, which has been plunged into deep recession. Even wealthy Gulf Arab states have been hit. Last week Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain raised interest rates as they moved to protect their currencies. Royal Dutch Shell and BP were among the top 10 biggest fallers on a quiet day for share trading in London. The FTSE 100 closed 17.5 points lower at 6035. However, Shell said on Monday that it is pressing ahead with its $60bn takeover of BG Group despite doubts among some shareholders about the deal\u2019s viability given the falling oil price. Sentiment in continental Europe was more influenced by the inconclusive election result in Spain than by the latest decline in the oil price. Spain\u2019s main stock market index, the Ibex 35, closed at its lowest for three months following a 3.6% fall on fears that a second election might be needed to form a stable government in Madrid. Germany\u2019s DAX fell 1%. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cThe inconclusive result of the Spanish general election is set to trigger a period of political uncertainty which could slow the country\u2019s economic recovery. But it also represents another blow to the eurozone\u2019s policy of onerous austerity.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sports Direct has accused Findel of under-delivering for shareholders after its attempt to put a representative on the board of the online retailer was rebuffed. Nearly 81% of shareholders who voted came out against a resolution to appoint Ben Gardener at an emergency shareholder meeting in Manchester on Monday. Sports Direct owns a 17.5% stake in Findel, having cut its investment from 19% last week. But the board won the backing of major investors Toscafund, Schroders and River &amp; Mercantile. The voting figures from the meeting indicated that Sports Direct was the only major shareholder to back Gardener. Findel\u2019s board advised shareholders to block the appointment, saying that Sports Direct was a direct competitor of its online football kit store, Kitbag, and was also interested in buying its Express Gifts division, which sells homewares, toys, games and other gifts online. In an angry statement issued after the vote, Sports Direct said: \u201cFindel should focus on trying to run its business more successfully and not reject offers of specialist assistance. \u201cAll the Findel business segments could have been improved for the benefit of all of its shareholders with the retail expertise of Sports Direct. Mr Gardener could have helped in all these regards and would have been a positive addition to a board that Sports Direct believes has under-delivered for its shareholders.\u201d It said the company had been without a chief executive since March and had not yet been able to agree terms of a sale of its Kitbag division despite announcing a transaction in September. Sports Direct said it had acquired its shareholding in Findel on the understanding that this would be \u201cof benefit to and welcomed by Findel and its other major shareholders\u201d and that Toscafund and Schroders were in support of Gardener\u2019s appointment. In response to Sports Direct\u2019s criticism, Findel said: \u201cOver the last five years the new leadership team of Findel has been very focused on restoring shareholder value and the group is on track to record another significant step up in profit before tax in the current financial year.\u201d Findel\u2019s board told shareholders ahead of Monday\u2019s vote that the most appropriate way for Sports Direct to influence its business was to \u201cmake a fair offer for the whole company\u201d. It is not clear whether Sports Direct, which has a history of taking strategic stakes in related companies including Debenhams and JD Sports, will now make a bid. The company is under pressure to make acquisitions to meet its growth targets and some analysts believe Findel would provide a fitting target. Shares in Findel soared in September when Sports Direct first revealed its stake on hopes that the sports retailer would make a bid. Findel is already in advanced talks over the sale of Kitbag to another unnamed party and investors hoped Sports Direct\u2019s stake-building signalled a potential bidding war. Matthew McEachran, a retail analyst at N+1 Singer, said Sports Direct would probably not buy Kitbag because its suppliers did not want their goods sold via owner Mike Ashley\u2019s business and could terminate their agreements under change of ownership clauses if he won control. He said Findel was nevertheless an attractive target for Sports Direct as its Express Gifts division had a well-developed financial services operation which could provide potential synergies and new potential avenues of growth. \u201cIt is difficult to second guess Sports Direct but the most logical step might be a bid for Findel in order to acquire Express Gifts. It could bring a huge strategic step change. At the moment there is a lot of investor concern about growth at Sports Direct. It is falling short of its targets and it needs to make acquisitions. Findel looks like it could fit the bill,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Spain\u2019s dramatic election result \u2013 a hung parliament and a roughly equal split between left and rightwing parties \u2013 was followed by only modest drama in financial markets. The Ibex-35 index of leading companies lost 3.6% and the yield on 10-year Spanish bonds rose eight basis points to 1.78%, but these are not big moves in the face of what is being billed as a momentous shift in the political landscape of a large eurozone country. Complacency on the part of investors, or a rational assessment that political uncertainty probably won\u2019t derail an economy forecast to grow by about 3% this year? On balance, the latter. The political map is messy, no doubt about it. Almost any combination of the four leading parties would look unstable. The conservative People\u2019s party of the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, could form an alliance with newcomer Ciudadanos, from the centre right, but would still fall short of an overall majority. An administration led by the Socialists could enlist the anti-austerity Podemos party but would still need support from pro-independence Catalans. Alternatively, a grand coalition of PP and the Socialists is possible but would not address the apparent message that Spaniards want change. Fresh elections next spring are possible. For all that, Spain is not Greece, or even Portugal. The European commission\u2019s latest forecasts suggest growth this year of 3.1% will be followed by 2.7% next year and 2.4% in 2017. If the next government lightens up on austerity, those projections might look more solid, not less. Meanwhile, a low oil price and a weak euro are strongly supportive and the European Central Bank will still be buying Spanish bonds. And, remember, none of the main parties is arguing for an exit from the euro. On the other side of the ledger, official unemployment in Spain stands at the appalling rate of 22% and public debt is roughly 100%. Those factors help to explain why the political landscape is so confused. But to translate a messy election result into a fresh economic crisis, or an automatic slump in inward investment, is a step too far. On day one, markets were right not to panic. Morrisons, a matter of convenience and delivery There was fresh indignity for Morrisons as it departed the FTSE 100 index: its founder and grocery supremo Sir Ken Morrison, a thorn in the side of the former chief executive Dalton Philips, was revealed as the owner of 2.6m shares in Sainsbury\u2019s. His son William is in for 2.1m, meaning the pair have \u00a311.9m backing Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cIt is a well-run company,\u201d Sir Ken told the Times (\u00a3). True, and is Sainsbury\u2019s also the company Sir Ken wishes Morrisons could have been? The great man didn\u2019t say that, but it is hard to avoid the contrast between the relative stability at Sainsbury\u2019s and the stop-start strategy pursued by Morrisons in recent years. Morrisons has more than twice as much debt - \u00a32bn at the last count \u2013 as it did five years ago when it was taking its first steps in convenience stores and contemplating its online options. The adventure into convenience stores has been abandoned by the new chief executive, David Potts, and the online offer seems to many outsiders to be more beneficial to Ocado, to whom delivery has been outsourced, than to Morrisons. Sainsbury\u2019s, of course, does both convenience and delivery. The difference is that it got into both markets early; with Tesco, it bagged most of the best high street sites. Morrisons, it now appears, came so late to both battles that it should have avoided them altogether and focused on combatting the more potent threat from discounters Aldi and Lidl. That, of course, is roughly what Sir Ken was arguing all along. Keep going, Shell shareholders Get your skates on, Shell shareholders, if you want to lobby the chief executive, Ben van Beurden, to renegotiate the terms of the planned \u00a336bn takeover of BG Group. Even as the price of oil fell to a new 11-year low on Monday, the oil giant took another step towards completing a cash-and-shares deal it negotiated last April when the price of a barrel of Brent was $65, not today\u2019s $36. It set a date for its shareholders to vote \u2013 27 January. Among major fund managers, only David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, has gone public with his misgivings, saying last week the takeover \u201cdoesn\u2019t make financial sense\u201d at the current oil price. If that is the extent of the rebellion, the deal will glide through. It\u2019s a very odd of state of affairs, though, since BG\u2019s board, if pushed, would surely be obliged to give some ground on the price to reflect changed circumstances. Yet nobody \u2013 Cumming apart \u2013 seems prepared to turn up the heat. Activism in fund management remains conspicuous by its absence.",

      "body": "<p>Spain\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/peoples-party-wins-spanish-election-absolute-majority\">dramatic election result</a> \u2013 a hung parliament and a roughly equal split between left and rightwing parties \u2013 was followed by only modest drama in financial markets. The Ibex-35 index of leading companies lost 3.6% and the yield on 10-year Spanish bonds rose eight basis points to 1.78%, but these are not big moves in the face of what is being billed as a momentous shift in the political landscape of a large eurozone country.</p> <p>Complacency on the part of investors, or a rational assessment that political uncertainty probably won\u2019t derail an economy forecast to grow by about 3% this year? On balance, the latter.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/peoples-party-wins-spanish-election-absolute-majority\">The political map is messy, no doubt about it</a>. Almost any combination of the four leading parties would look unstable. The conservative People\u2019s party of the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, could form an alliance with newcomer Ciudadanos, from the centre right, but would still fall short of an overall majority. An administration led by the Socialists could enlist the anti-austerity Podemos party but would still need support from pro-independence Catalans.</p> <p>Alternatively, a grand coalition of PP and the Socialists is possible but would not address the apparent message that Spaniards want change. Fresh elections next spring are possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/dec/21/spanish-elections-unprecedented-result-what-happens-next\">Spanish elections: what happens next after the unprecedented result?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all that, Spain is not Greece, or even Portugal. The European commission\u2019s latest forecasts suggest growth this year of 3.1% will be followed by 2.7% next year and 2.4% in 2017. If the next government lightens up on austerity, those projections might look more solid, not less. Meanwhile, a low oil price and a weak euro are strongly supportive and the European Central Bank will still be buying Spanish bonds. And, remember, none of the main parties is arguing for an exit from the euro.</p> <p>On the other side of the ledger, official unemployment in Spain stands at the appalling rate of 22% and public debt is roughly 100%. Those factors help to explain why the political landscape is so confused. But to translate a messy election result into a fresh economic crisis, or an automatic slump in inward investment, is a step too far. On day one, markets were right not to panic.</p> <h2>Morrisons, a matter of convenience and delivery</h2> <p>There was fresh indignity for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/02/morrisons-braced-for-ftse-100-demotion\">Morrisons as it departed the FTSE 100 index</a>: its founder and grocery supremo Sir Ken Morrison, a thorn in the side of the former chief executive Dalton Philips, was revealed as the owner of 2.6m shares in Sainsbury\u2019s. His son William is in for 2.1m, meaning the pair have \u00a311.9m backing Sainsbury\u2019s. \u201cIt is a well-run company,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/industries/retailing/article4646100.ece\">Sir Ken told the Times (\u00a3)</a>.<br></p> <p>True, and is Sainsbury\u2019s also the company Sir Ken wishes Morrisons could have been? The great man didn\u2019t say that, but it is hard to avoid the contrast between the relative stability at Sainsbury\u2019s and the stop-start strategy pursued by Morrisons in recent years.</p> <p>Morrisons has more than twice as much debt - \u00a32bn at the last count \u2013 as it did five years ago when it was taking its first steps in convenience stores and contemplating its online options. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/14/morrisons-daily-convenience-stores-launched-trial-crewe\">The adventure into convenience stores</a> has been abandoned by the new chief executive, David Potts, and the online offer seems to many outsiders to be more beneficial to Ocado, to whom delivery has been outsourced, than to Morrisons.</p> <p>Sainsbury\u2019s, of course, does both convenience and delivery. The difference is that it got into both markets early; with Tesco, it bagged most of the best high street sites. Morrisons, it now appears, came so late to both battles that it should have avoided them altogether and focused on combatting the more potent threat from discounters Aldi and Lidl. That, of course, is roughly what Sir Ken was arguing all along.</p> <h2>Keep going, Shell shareholders</h2> <p>Get your skates on, Shell shareholders,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/21/shell-shareholders-move-to-back-35bn-takeover-of-bg\"> if you want to lobby the chief executive, Ben van Beurden</a>, to renegotiate the terms of the planned \u00a336bn takeover of BG Group. Even as the price of oil fell to a new 11-year low on Monday, the oil giant took another step towards completing a cash-and-shares deal it negotiated last April when the price of a barrel of Brent was $65, not today\u2019s $36. It set a date for its shareholders to vote \u2013 27 January.<br></p> <p>Among major fund managers, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/21/shell-deal-bg-group-takeover-on-track-shareholder-doubts\">only David Cumming</a>, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, has gone public with his misgivings, saying last week the takeover \u201cdoesn\u2019t make financial sense\u201d at the current oil price. If that is the extent of the rebellion, the deal will glide through.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very odd of state of affairs, though, since BG\u2019s board, if pushed, would surely be obliged to give some ground on the price to reflect changed circumstances. Yet nobody \u2013 Cumming apart \u2013 seems prepared to turn up the heat. Activism in fund management remains conspicuous by its absence.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Some of the largest shareholders in Royal Dutch Shell, the giant petroleum and energy group, are expected to publicly back the company\u2019s $53bn (\u00a335bn) takeover of BG amid concern the deal could be sabotaged by those who want it scrapped. The Guardian understands that a group of Shell shareholders, headed by Old Mutual\u2019s Richard Buxton, believe the deal still makes sense and are expected to declare so publicly in the next day or two. Those who are considering going public in support of the deal would account for about 10% of the equity. Buxton is said to think that the low oil price environment will lead to further cost-cutting in the sector and others such as Chris Wheaton of Allianz Global Investors are keen on the deal going ahead, believing it will bring Shell some much-needed deep water assets. One significant Shell shareholder said: \u201cIn the medium to long-term this is a good deal.\u201d The Qatar Investment Authority and Henderson and Aberdeen Asset Management are also believed to be keen to support the deal. Some shareholders such as David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, have argued that the deal no longer makes sense because of the fall in the price of oil. He called on Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, to pay a $750m break fee to scrap the deal or renegotiate the terms. The only other option is for shareholders to vote against the takeover, he said. The price of oil has slumped from $115 a barrel in summer 2014 to less than $40. On Monday it dropped to an 11-year low of $36.17. Shareholder approval is the final remaining hurdle to clear Shell\u2019s takeover of its smaller rival, one of the largest energy deals in a decade that will create the world\u2019s most powerful liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader. Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group shareholders are expected to vote on the merger of the two companies on 27 and 28 January respectively, the firms said on Monday. Shell needs 50% shareholder approval and 75% of BG Group investors to agree for the deal to go ahead. Worth $70bn at the time of the offer in April, it is worth about $53bn at current market valuations as shares in commodities companies have endured a rough year as the price of oil tumbled. BG asked Britain\u2019s high court on Monday for approval to publish its scheme document and to convene the shareholder meetings, the companies said. Court approval is expected on Tuesday, the companies said, followed by the publication of BG\u2019s scheme document and the Shell shareholder prospectus. Following shareholder approval, the delisting of an acquired company\u2019s shares typically takes about 10 working days. This means Shell\u2019s takeover of BG could be completed in mid-February.",

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, his first since his arrest on fraud charges last Friday, Shkreli said he had been arrested because his former company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, had raised the price of 70-year-old drug Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 overnight. \u201cTrying to find anything we could to stop him, was the attitude of the government,\u201d Shkreli said. \u201cBeating the person up and then trying to find the merits to make up for it \u2013 I would have hoped the government wouldn\u2019t take that kind of approach.\u201d Shkreli\u2019s arrest stemmed from an investigation into his former life as a hedge-fund manager and not from the Turing controversy, which provoked ire around the world and attracted the censure of presidential candidates Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. The now former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, who has proclaimed his innocence on Twitter, described his arrest to the Journal as a \u201creal injustice\u201d and \u201cdefinitely not something I deserve given the facts\u201d. It\u2019s been a busy couple of days for Shkreli, who has been released on $5m bail. On Friday he resigned from Turing Pharmaceuticals. On Saturday, he took to Twitter to describe the allegations as \u201cbaseless and without merit\u201d. Robert Capers, US attorney of the eastern district of New York, said the charges against Shkreli were \u201ca securities fraud trifecta of lies, deceit, and greed\u201d. \u201cShkreli essentially ran his companies like Ponzi schemes, where he used each subsequent company to pay off defrauded investors from the previous company,\u201d said Capers, adding that the scheme cost investors more than $11m. Next to Capers onstage was a presentation board with large letter on top, saying \u201cShkreli\u2019s Ponzi-like Scheme\u201d. Shkreli was especially upset by the news conference, which he called \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cThey used the term \u2018Ponzi,\u2019 or \u2018Ponzi-like,\u201d which is nowhere near reality. The indictment doesn\u2019t use that word,\u201d said 32-year-old Shkreli. Shkreli\u2019s Twitter account was hacked over the weekend. The hackers changed Shkreli\u2019s name to \u201cMartin The God\u201d and his bio to \u201cFuck Yall ...\u201d. Tweets sent by the hackers included: The tweets, which were sent in the early afternoon on Sunday, remained up until Monday morning. Shortly before 11am ET on Monday, Shkreli tweeted: \u201cI was hacked \u2013 I now have control of this account.\u201d Within minutes, the other messages were deleted.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Two former directors of iSoft, the NHS software supplier, have been barred from practising as accountants almost a decade after the one-time FTSE 250 firm was engulfed in an accounting scandal. The action by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the professional regulator, comes nine years after iSoft shareholders were told of \u201caccounting irregularities\u201d. The company had been booking revenues in its financial updates before a major contract had been signed. Tim Whiston, iSoft\u2019s former finance director who also briefly served as chief executive, and John Whelan, who served as finance director for a short period, have been banned for eight years. The sanction comes six months after the Guardian revealed that the FRC had quietly dropped its investigation into iSoft co-founder and former executive chairman Patrick Cryne. Whiston, 48, who had sold shares in iSoft for \u00a35.2m in 2005, agreed this month to pay \u00a350,000 as a contribution towards the cost of investigating his misconduct. Neither he nor Whelan were fined by the regulator. The scandal dates from2006, when iSoft issued a heavy profit warning and admitted the company\u2019s books would need to be restated. Shares in the company went on to lose more than 90% of their value before it was bought by Australian rival IBA Health in 2007. Once a stockmarket star, iSoft had been valued at \u00a31bn. As its shares had climbed, several directors, led by Cryne, who is best known as owner of Barnsley football club, had become millionaires by selling shares. Cryne and operations director Steve Graham netted \u00a341m and \u00a330m, respectively, between 2001 and 2005. In settlements announced by the FRC on Monday, the regulator found that in 2003 and 2004 Whiston and Whelan had acted recklessly and had failed to act with integrity in relation to one contract with the Irish health service. Revenues from the contract had been reported in iSoft\u2019s financial statements before the agreement had been concluded. There was no finding of dishonesty against either Whiston or Whelan, both of whom had been acquitted of criminal offences relating to the same allegations. In 2010, they had been charged, together with Cryne and Graham, with the criminal offence of conspiracy to mislead investors. All four denied the allegations, and were ultimately cleared of wrongdoing after the prosecution against three of them collapsed at trial. The prosecution had been brought by the Financial Conduct Authority, the regulator in charge of consumer protection. It emerged in court there was confusion in prosecution records of where key evidence had been found in iSoft\u2019s offices. The trial collapsed and the judge ordered that the defendants be acquitted. Cryne, who had been due to be tried at a later date for health reasons, was also cleared. The accountancy regulator has already issued an eight-year ban on a former junior iSoft accountant who later helped blow the whistle on the accounting scandal. The group\u2019s auditor, RSM Robson Rhodes, now part of Grant Thornton, also faced sanction for failing to make proper checks before signing off iSoft\u2019s financial statements. It was fined \u00a3225,000. Shortly after the criminal case against the former iSoft directors collapsed, the FRC unsealed details of the disciplinary action against RSM Robson Rhodes, laying bare a catalogue of accounting failures that had misled investors between 2003 and 2005. The FRC findings against the former auditor went beyond the narrow focus of the single Irish healthcare IT contract which had formed the basis of the FCA\u2019s failed prosecution.",

      "bodyText": "Consumer confidence in the eurozone was slightly better than expected in December. A flash estimate from the European Commission showed confidence rose from -6 in November to -5.7, higher than the -5.85 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. In the EU as a whole confidence rose 0.7 points to -3.7. And on that note, it\u2019s time to close the blog for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. US markets have followed Europe with an upbeat start to trading despite oil falling to an 11 year low. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 140 points or 0.85 while the S&amp;P 500 has added 0.55% and Nasdaq is up 0.76% Meanwhile Spain\u2019s stock market is still under pressure, but in the rest of Europe investors seem happy to push shares higher. Spain\u2019s Ibex is down nearly 2.5%, but the FTSE 100 and Germany\u2019s Dax are both up 0.9%, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.45%. Oil continues to slide, with Brent crude currently down 1.76% at $36.23 a barrel have fallen as low as $36.04. Here\u2019s a look at what happens next after Spain\u2019s uncertain election result: Former UBS trader Tom Hayes has had his sentence for his Libor fixing conviction cut from 14 years to 11 years after an appeal. The court of appeal in London considered mitigating factors such as his Asperger\u2019s syndrome diagnosis, but his lawyers and family failed to have the conviction overturned. Here is our report on his sentencing in August: Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct has failed in its attempt to appoint an executive onto the board of online retailer Findel. Sports Direct, embroiled in a row about its working practices following a Guardian investigation, wanted to put one of its employees, Ben Gardener, onto the Findel board after buying a 19% stake in the business. But Findel resisted the move, and at a meeting today requisitioned by Sports Direct nearly 81% of shareholders voted against Gardener\u2019s appointment. Only 19% - presumably the Sports Direct stake - was voted in favour. Sports Direct looked likely to be defeated after major shareholders Toscafund, Schroders and River &amp; Mercantile, who together control 43.9% of Findel, had already agreed to vote against Sports Direct. Ashley needed 50% to win the day. Guaranteed to dampen the new year cheer: Spain\u2019s election result means the most market friendly coalition cannot happen, says economist Edoardo Campanella at UniCredit Research: Spain has inaugurated its new multi-party era in the most troubling way. As expected the PP led by the incumbent Mariano Rajoy won a Pyrrhic victory at yesterday\u2019s general elections. However, the anticipated lack of an absolute majority came with the unexpected poor performance of the PP potential coalition partner, Ciudadanos, that was relegated to the fourth place by a large margin. So, a PP-Ciudadanos executive, that before the vote was seen as the most likely and market friendly option, is no longer feasible. All the other possible alliances pose issues. Given the relative parliamentary weights, the least fragile government may be a grand coalition between the PP and the PSOE. Although the programmatic differences are material, this alliance may provide an opportunity for the traditional parties to preserve the old order and marginalize both Podemos and Ciudadanos. The main drawback of this alliance is that, if it does not last long, it would backfire, strengthening the popularity of those outside it. If no deal is reached, Spain will likely head to fresh elections in the spring. The timeline is as follows. The parliament convenes on January 13 and the King proposes a PM candidate, who needs to pass a confidence motion by absolute majority in a first investiture vote or by a simple majority in a second vote. The first vote would likely take place on January 18-22. If the parliament fails to elect a new PM, it would be dissolved two months after the first investiture vote, and then a new election would take place 30 to 60 days later. So government negotiations can potentially last until the second half of March. If these talks are not successful, fresh elections would be called in late April/May. Meanwhile, Mariano Rajoy remains as caretaker PM. Here\u2019s more on why the Spanish market is falling following the weekend\u2019s election, courtesy of Bloomberg: \u201cThe market was not ready for this result, it\u2019s one of the worst scenarios that we could imagine,\u201d Nuria Alvarez, a bank analyst at Renta 4 Banco SA in Madrid, said by phone. \u201cThe uncertainty is especially bad for the banking and the utility sectors since there can be regulatory changes that could affect them.\u201d European markets are continuing to hold much of their gains, with the exception being Spain after the uncertain election result. The Ibex is currently down around 2% but Germany\u2019s Dax and the FTSE 100 are both up around 0.9%, while France\u2019s Cac has climbed 0.5%. On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is forecast to open around 120 points higher, so the mini-rally could be maintained. Despite the CBI survey coming in slightly below expectations, it does point to a reasonable run-up to Christmas, says Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight: Most sectors are reported to have seen sales growth in December, with strong performances in the online, clothing and recreational goods sectors, and also for online retailers. The relatively decent CBI survey follows on from the Office for National Statistics reporting that retail sales volumes jumped 1.7% month-on-month and 5.0% year-on-year in November. Retailers have been hoping that this will be a good Christmas for them given consumers\u2019 generally improved purchasing power and the December CBI survey and November retail sales data suggests that their hopes could be largely realized. Obviously retailers will be hoping that there is a final flurry in sales over the last few days before Christmas. However, retailers are not particularly upbeat about sales prospects in January. We believe that the fundamentals for consumers should still be pretty decent in 2016, although there is currently appreciable uncertainty over how earnings growth will develop. Consumer price inflation looks likely to only rise gradually during the year... Meanwhile, employment should increase further. Despite its recent relapse, we believe that earnings growth will strengthen in 2016 due to the tightness of the labour market \u2013 although there is the possibility that it will be limited by employers using prolonged negligible inflation as a reason to curb pay awards. Furthermore, interest rates will likely only inch up in 2016. However, some consumers will be affected by tighter fiscal policy, notably reduced welfare benefits \u2013 although even here Chancellor George Osborne has abolished plans to cut working tax credits in 2016 and 2017. UK retail sales rose slightly less than expected in the run-up to Christmas, according to the latest distributive trends survey from the CBI, with the outlook for January also weak. The balance in the survey rose from a nine month low of +7 in November to +19 in December, but this was lower than the +21 forecast by a Reuters poll. The balance records the difference between the number responding positively and those replying negatively. As for expected sales next month, they were at their lowest level since May 2012. The CBI\u2019s Barry Williams said: It\u2019s no surprise sales have recovered as we head into the final shopping days of the Christmas season. It would be ideal if the industry could keep that momentum into the New Year but retailers know 2015 was tough, and they\u2019re expecting 2016 to start in much the same vein. Here\u2019s the full CBI report. Here\u2019s the worst performers so far in the Spanish index: For a break from the serious business, why not try our Christmas quiz: More on the rebound in stock markets, Spain excepted. Jasper Lawler at CMC Markets said: Thin holiday market liquidity has spurred a nice rebound in share prices on Monday after uncertainty surrounding Spain\u2019s election result caused a lower open across Europe. Spain\u2019s Ibex stock index dived to its worst day in three months whilst Spanish bond yields spiked as investors reacted to the country\u2019s uncertain political future. There is no clear majority after Sunday\u2019s election in Spain since a coalition between prime minister Rajoy\u2019s People\u2019s Party and the liberal Ciudadanos would not be enough to form a majority. There\u2019s a chance a socialist government could take charge if Rajoy can\u2019t form an alliance of parties in the next few days. A socialist government in Spain would not be the end of the world and the recent experience from Portugal suggests bond yields would likely normalise after the initial shock. More broadly, the Spanish election result is another sign of anti-establishment feeling in Europe brought on by discontent particularly amongst the youth and unemployed which were hit hardest during the 2008 financial crisis. The European Central Bank disappointed the market earlier this month when its latest stimulus programme was deemed insufficient to boost the region\u2019s flagging economy. The ECB had been tipped to unveil a major expansion of its \u20ac60bn-a-month quantitative easing (QE) programme. In the event it sanctioned just a six month extension to the end date and announced a small cut in the deposit rate. But the bank\u2019s chief economist has said in an interview with a Belgian newspaper that it would maintain its programme for as long as necessary, given the risk of a slowdown in growth in emerging markets. Reuters reports: \u201cIt (the ECB) will pursue an accommodative monetary policy for as long as is necessary. Without giving a date, this timescale is fairly long,\u201d Peter Praet, who is also a member of the bank\u2019s executive board, told La Libre Belgique. \u201cAdditional risks have arisen from the slowdown in the emerging countries, risks that are pretty significant for the euro area. There are also downward pressures on prices in the manufacturing sector as a result of surplus output and the very high unemployment level.\u201d Of course, Greece\u2019s former finance minister cannot resist a comment on the Spanish election, which saw anti-austerity party Podemos gain ground: And here\u2019s a bit of historical context for the Spanish election: Meanwhile Spanish bond yields have the their highest level in a month following the inconclusive election result. The country\u2019s 10 year yields rose 18 basis points to 1.89% at one point, while 30 year yields climbed to more than 3%. Jan von Gench, chief fixed income analyst at Nordea, told Reuters: Uncertainty is never good news for markets, which have been buying into the reform story in Spain. The best you can hope for is that the progress that has been done won\u2019t be reversed following these election results. The euro has also come under pressure after the Spanish news. Ilya Spivak, currency strategist at DailyFX, said: The euro gapped down at the weekly trading open after Spain\u2019s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and his PP party lost parliamentary majority at a general election held over the weekend. This opens the door for coalition negotiations that may bring the eurosceptic, anti-austerity Podemos party into government as part of a broader left-leaning coalition led by the PSOE, the PP\u2019s top rival. Podemos is seen as analogous to Greece\u2019s Syriza, whose firm opposition to EU/IMF-mandated austerity measures spooked investors with the possibility of a heretofore unprecedented exit of a euro member state out of the currency bloc. A similar narrative playing out in the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy could prove deeply destabilizing for regional and global markets. The single currency\u2019s response has been relatively muted thus far however as traders await greater clarity. Stock markets continue on their unpredictable way, with the thinner trading in the shortened Christmas week likely to be adding to the uncertainty. After early falls, most indices are now in positive territory, with Germany\u2019s Dax up 131 points 0r 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac 0.5% better. The FTSE 100 meanwhile is 0.9% or 55 points higher. But with the uncertain outcome of the weekend\u2019s election, Spanish shares remain down on the day so far, with the Ibex off 2.2%. Santa rally after all, anyone? Here\u2019s our story on the fall in oil prices. Sean Farrell reports: Oil has fallen to an 11-year low as traders took fright at the prospect of a glut caused by fresh supplies that will outstrip global demand. Brent crude prices dropped almost 2% to as low as $36.17 a barrel, the lowest since July 2004 and weaker than during the worst of the financial crisis. The price fell to $36.20 on Christmas Eve 2008 as the global economy headed for recession following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The price of Brent, the global benchmark, nudged back up to $36.42 but prices were still below those of the previous trading day. Global production is hovering around a record high and the market faces fresh supplies from Iran as Western sanctions are lifted and Iran seeks to win back customers from Saudi Arabia and Russia. Extra supplies are also looming from the US, where stockpiles are growing as extra drilling rigs are put into operation. The full story is here: Back with UK retail, and the former chairman of Morrisons has bought a stake in rival supermarket group Sainsbury. Sir Ken Morrison and his son William bought 4.7m shares worth around \u00a312m earlier this year, according to the Times. Sir Ken, who has 2.6m of the shares, also gave his public backing to Sainsbury chief executive Mike Coupe. With Spain\u2019s Ibex now down around 3%, financial analyst Connor Campbell from Spreadex said: In a year full of election drama Spain managed to sneak theirs in just under the wire, Sunday\u2019s vote seeing incumbent prime minister Mariano Rajoy\u2019 People\u2019s Party ostensibly still in power, but with a mere 123 seats lightyears away from a majority. That leaves Podemos and Ciudandanos, the two major destabilisers in this election, third and fourth respectively after securing 69 and 40 seats (the Socialists coming in second with 90), meaning whatever Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a coalition arises out of these results will likely be dictated by the country\u2019s two youngest parties. It\u2019s like the Greek election saga in a minor key, one that poses a host of new problems for a country that has spent the last few months gradually sinking to the bottom of the Eurozone\u2019s unofficial performance chart. European markets are heading lower in general, but an exception is the FTSE 100 which is currently up 26 points or 0.44%. It has been helped by a little pre-Christmas takeover speculation, following a Mail on Sunday report that US group Comcast could be plotting an \u00a311bn bid for ITV. The talk has pushed the UK broadcaster up more than 4%. UK listed mining shares have found some support after recent falls, but retailers are on the slide on concerns about heavy discounting during the Christmas shopping period. Earlier, German producer prices came in much as expected, down 0.2% month on month in November and 2.5% lower year on year. The October figures showed a 0.4% month on month dip and a 2.3% year on year decline. The uncertainty caused by the weekend\u2019s general election in Spain has seen the country\u2019s stock market open sharply lower, with the Ibex down 2.5%. Elsewhere Portugal\u2019s PS120 has fallen 0.6%, while France\u2019s Cac is down 0.2%. The FTSE 100 is virtually flat, down 5 points or 0.1%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is up 0.2% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has edged up 0.1%. Over in Greece, and prime minister Alexis Tsipras apparently does not want the International Monetary Fund to take part in the country\u2019s third, \u20ac86bn bailout. This goes against the views of other eurozone members, notably Germany, who are keen for the IMF to be involved. In an interview with the Financial Times Tsipras said he wanted the eurozone to take full responsibility for overseeing economic reforms. The FT reports: Mr Tsipras said in an interview with the Financial Times he was \u201cpuzzled by the unconstructive attitude of the fund on fiscal and financial issues\u201d. He indicated that the IMF should leave his country\u2019s third bailout to the eurozone when it decides whether to stay involved early next year. \u201cWe think that after six years of managing in extraordinary crisis, Europe now has the institutional capacity to deal successfully with intra-European issues.\u201d Mr Tsipras\u2019s assertion is likely to anger the German government, which has always insisted the IMF stay on board. Berlin values the fund\u2019s technical expertise as much as it doubts the European Commission\u2019s resolve. The full report is here (\u00a3). Back with oil, and Brent crude is currently down 1.6% at $36.29 having fallen as low as $36.17. That is the lowest level since July 2004, a level which oil has been testing for several days now. The level it had to breach was $36.20 which it reached in December 2008. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Spain and oil are in the spotlight this morning, as the recent market volatility continues into the shortened Christmas trading week. The weekend\u2019s election in Spain saw current prime minister Mariano Rajoy winning the largest number of wotes, but none of the parties came out with an overall majority. This is likely to lead to weeks of uncertainty, with doubts over the prospects for the country\u2019s economic outlook. Here is our latest report: Spanish politicians are gearing up for what could be weeks of complicated negotiations after Sunday\u2019s general election yielded a deeply fragmented parliament, with the conservative People\u2019s party losing ground to national newcomers Podemos and Ciudadanos. The PP won 123 seats in the election, with 29% of the vote, leaving them far from a majority in the 350-seat legislature. Led by Mariano Rajoy, the current prime minister, Sunday\u2019s election results left the party with limited possibilities when it comes to the alliances they now need to form a stable government majority. The full story is here: Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:L European stocks look set for a weaker open on Monday, tracking the late sell-off in US markets on Friday as uncertainty surrounds the Spanish election results. Spain\u2019s governing conservative party won but has lost its majority after losing seats to new parties Podemos and Ciudadanos, so must now form a coalition. The risk is that as part of a coalition, Rajoy will have to make concessions on economic policy at the expense of Spain\u2019s burgeoning economic recovery. Here are IG\u2019s expectations for the European opening: Elsewhere the Nikkei 225 has fallen 0.3% while the Hang Seng edged up 0.25%. As for oil, Brent crude has dropped to levels not seen since 2004 on continuing fears about a glut of supply amid a slowdown in the global economy. Otherwise it is a fairly quiet day on the economic front, as befits the start of the festive week. More US shopping news is due, after the weekend\u2019s panic buying for last minute presents, with the latest CBI distributive trends survey for December.",

The parliament convenes on January 13 and the King proposes a PM candidate, who needs to pass a confidence motion by absolute majority in a first investiture vote or by a simple majority in a second vote. The first vote would likely take place on January 18-22. If the parliament fails to elect a new PM, it would be dissolved two months after the first investiture vote, and then a new election would take place 30 to 60 days later. So government negotiations can potentially last until the second half of March. If these talks are not successful, fresh elections would be called in late April/May. Meanwhile, Mariano Rajoy remains as caretaker PM. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b83c3b44e545146ab9e1adfc97cd25fa17b4a29d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b83c3b44e545146ab9e1adfc97cd25fa17b4a29d/0_0_4762_3242/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Podemos supporters celebrate the election results in Madrid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Podemos supporters celebrate the election results in Madrid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DYDPPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2015-12-21T12:29:48.625Z\">at 12.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5677e5fde4b0d1dfc830b124\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-21T11:44:46.040Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s more on why the Spanish market is falling following the weekend\u2019s election, <strong><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-21/santander-bbva-lead-declines-in-spain-on-political-instability\">courtesy of Bloomberg</a></strong>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cThe market was not ready for this result, it\u2019s one of the worst scenarios that we could imagine,\u201d Nuria Alvarez, a bank analyst at Renta 4 Banco SA in Madrid, said by phone. \u201cThe uncertainty is especially bad for the banking and the utility sectors since there can be regulatory changes that could affect them.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5677e518e4b0c713d00aafd0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-21T11:42:48.369Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>European markets are continuing to hold much of their gains, with the exception being Spain after the uncertain election result.

However, retailers are not particularly upbeat about sales prospects in January. </p> <p>We believe that the fundamentals for consumers should still be pretty decent in 2016, although there is currently appreciable uncertainty over how earnings growth will develop. Consumer price inflation looks likely to only rise gradually during the year... Meanwhile, employment should increase further. Despite its recent relapse, we believe that earnings growth will strengthen in 2016 due to the tightness of the labour market \u2013 although there is the possibility that it will be limited by employers using prolonged negligible inflation as a reason to curb pay awards. Furthermore, interest rates will likely only inch up in 2016. However, some consumers will be affected by tighter fiscal policy, notably reduced welfare benefits \u2013 although even here Chancellor George Osborne has abolished plans to cut working tax credits in 2016 and 2017.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5677dc8ee4b0badd2cc9aa5d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2015-12-21T11:10:55.723Z\">11.10am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK retail sales disappoint - CBI</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>UK retail sales rose slightly less than expected in the run-up to Christmas, according to the latest distributive trends survey from the CBI, with the outlook for January also weak.</p> <p>The balance in the survey rose from a nine month low of +7 in November to +19 in December, but this was lower than the +21 forecast by a Reuters poll.

In an interview with the Financial Times Tsipras said he wanted the eurozone to take full responsibility for overseeing economic reforms. The FT reports:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr Tsipras said in an interview with the Financial Times he was \u201cpuzzled by the unconstructive attitude of the fund on fiscal and financial issues\u201d. He indicated that the IMF should leave his country\u2019s third bailout to the eurozone when it decides whether to stay involved early next year.</p> <p>\u201cWe think that after six years of managing in extraordinary crisis, Europe now has the institutional capacity to deal successfully with intra-European issues.\u201d</p> <p>Mr Tsipras\u2019s assertion is likely to anger the German government, which has always insisted the IMF stay on board.

      "bodyText": "The craft beer brand Camden Town Brewery is to put its independent image on the line after agreeing to be bought by the global drinks giant AB InBev. The UK brewer said it had accepted a takeover offer from the world\u2019s biggest drinks company in order to fund international growth plans. The deal, worth about \u00a385m, adds Camden\u2019s niche Hells, Pils and Pale Ale brands to a stable that includes mass-market offerings such as Budweiser, Stella Artois and Beck\u2019s. But the takeover drew immediate criticism from craft beer purists, many of who view the major brewing companies with suspicion. James Watt, founder of craft beer group Brewdog, rounded on his rival for selling out to a global behemoth of the drinks industry. He said Brewdog would no longer stock any Camden Town beers in its bars because it does not sell drinks made by AB InBev. Long-time fans of Camden Brewing Company also expressed their disappointment. Twitter used @missjademusic simply asked: \u201cWhy Camden Brewery!?!? WHY!!!\u201d Global brewers such as AB InBev, which is about to buy its nearest rival SAB Miller, for more than \u00a370bn, have faced a growing challenge from craft beers made by independent firms. And they have responded either by launching rival offerings borrowing the imagery and language of challenger brands, or simply buying them out. Peroni and Grolsch owner SAB Miller snapped up Camden\u2019s rival Meantime earlier this year, while Diageo used its Guinness brand as a launchpad for a series of ales and porters. Carlsberg has also launched a range it calls Crafted in a bid to capture the more discerning beer drinker. AB InBev did not disclose how much it paid to get its hands on Camden Brewing Company. But Camden\u2019s own crowdfunding website suggests it was worth around \u00a350m at the time of a fundraising exercise which closed in July. A letter to shareholders about the latest deal revealed they were being offered between \u00a31.0861 and \u00a31.2526 per share, depending on whether they accept an option with a variable element based on sales growth. Reports said this was a return on investment of just under 70%, implying that AB InBev paid around \u00a385m. The founder of Camden Town Brewery, Jasper Cuppaidge, told the Guardian that investors should be \u201cecstatic\u201d that the shares had been bought at a premium. Cuppaidge, his family and three best friends own 95% of the company\u2019s equity, suggesting that they have shared a combined payout of more than \u00a380m. The company\u2019s latest accounts, for the year to the end of 2014, show a pre-tax profit of \u00a3319,000 on revenues of more than \u00a39.5m. Cuppaidge said the businesses now need a major investor to increase sales by funding the construction of a second brewery that will create 30 jobs. He insisted that being bought by a large brewer would not force the company into brewing a more generic version of its brands. \u201cAB InBev are investing to build a new brewery to our exact standards, so I can continue to make great beer. They\u2019re not making a beer for us. \u201cTo stay at the forefront of this movement and secure our future success, we have to build a bigger brewery, employ more people and gain access to an international distribution network,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this on our own.\u201d He compared the company to smoothie maker Innocent, whose founders also decided to sell up after a blockbuster offer. \u201cYou only have to look at brands such as Innocent ... They\u2019ve gone from strength to strength by joining up with Coca-Cola,\u201d he said. But a question and answer session in which Cuppaidge took charge of the company\u2019s Twitter account invited some less than enthusiastic comments. Matthew Lee expressed concerns about the quality of the beer made by AB InBev. Other beer afficionados likened the takeover to Kraft\u2019s buyout of Cadbury, saying quality would suffer. Seb Bardin suggested Camden Town Brewery had forfeited its right to be considered a craft beer. And Ben Marlow-Booth simply asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the going rate for a soul these days?\u201d Cuppaidge founded Camden Town Brewery in 2010 with just three staff. He has since built it into a well-known staple of London pubs, selling 12 million pints in 2015 from more than 1000 pubs, bars and restaurants. Iain Newell, European director of craft beers at AB InBev, said: \u201cWe have a passion for great beer. \u201cCamden Town is a creative business with a great range of brands that will complement our existing portfolio.\u201d Mark Benner, managing director of the Society of Independent Brewers (Siba) said: \u201cAs craft beer continues to grow in popularity and steal market share we are likely to see more global brewers looking to take over craft breweries, something which makes membership to Siba even more important for breweries looking to differentiate themselves, as consumers look to seek out truly independent craft brewed beers.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 December 2015 because Guinness is owned by Diageo, not SAB Miller as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Dutch Shell is pressing ahead with its $60bn (\u00a340bn) takeover of BG Group despite doubts among some shareholders about the deal\u2019s viability given the falling oil price. Shell said it intends to publish its takeover prospectus on Tuesday with the company and BG planning to hold shareholder votes on the deal in late January. Shell said the deal would complete in the first few months of 2016. China\u2019s competition authority approved the acquisition last week, finishing the regulatory agreements needed before the deal moves towards completion. Some Shell shareholders believe the company is paying over the odds for BG because the deal was agreed in April on the assumption that oil prices would recover to $90 a barrel by 2020. The price of oil has slumped from $115 a barrel in summer 2014 to less than $40. On Monday it dropped to an 11-year low of $36.17. David Cumming, head of equities at Standard Life Investments, said last week the deal does not make sense with the oil price so low. He called on Shell\u2019s boss, Ben van Beurden, to pay a $750m break fee to scrap the deal or renegotiate the terms. The only other option is for shareholders to vote against the takeover, he said. Shell has said the falling oil price is reflected in the value of the deal, which has dropped by $10bn since it was announced because Shell is using its own shares as part payment. But there is also an inflexible and substantial cash payment to BG shareholders. Shell\u2019s proposed timetable indicates it intends to complete the deal without amending the terms. BG is applying to the high court on Monday for approval to publish its scheme of arrangement document outlining the sale to its shareholders. If court approval is speedy, BG will publish the document on Tuesday and Shell will issue its prospectus on the same day. Shell said: \u201cShell and BG announce that, following satisfaction of the final precondition to the recommended combination and with the unanimous approval of both boards, BG is today seeking the approval of the high court to publish its scheme document and convene the related shareholder meetings.\u201d Both companies need 50% shareholder approval plus one vote to approve the deal but BG also requires votes representing 75% of the total value of its shares in favour. Analysts at Credit Suisse have argued the deal makes sense despite the lower oil price because it reduces Shell\u2019s risk and makes it more efficient, providing protection for its dividend. Shell\u2019s shares, down by a third this year, were little changed at \u00a314.68 by Monday lunchtime in London. BG shares rose 2% to 923p.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The Financial Reporting Council is investigating Grant Thornton over the accountancy firm\u2019s auditing of Globo, the mobile technology company that went into administration after discovering financial irregularities. The FRC, which regulates accountancy firms, said it would examine Grant Thornton\u2019s audits of Globo for last year and the year before. The Financial Conduct Authority is investigating Globo separately. Grant Thornton was announced as Globo\u2019s auditor in March 2014, replacing BDO, which had only been in place for a few months. Globo said it had appointed Grant Thornton after a competitive tender of three of the top five auditing firms. FRC investigations usually take many months before it decides whether to bring a formal case at a tribunal. If a tribunal finds against a firm, the FRC can impose unlimited fines and reprimands on the firm and its employees and can strike off accountants. It could also decide that a tribunal is not in the public interest and drop the case. In a brief statement, the regulator said: \u201cThe Financial Reporting Council has launched an investigation under the accountancy scheme into Grant Thornton UK LLP\u2019s audits of the consolidated financial statements of Globo plc for the years ended 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014.\u201d Globo was criticised in October by a US hedge fund which raised questions about its revenue and finances, sending the company\u2019s shares plunging. The fund, Quintessential Capital Management, held a short position in Globo that meant it would profit if the shares fell. Globo rejected Quintessential\u2019s analysis but three days later it revealed that its chief executive, Konstantinos Papadimitrakopoulos, had resigned after disclosing falsification of data and misrepresentation of the company\u2019s financial position. It also said Papadimitrakopoulos had sold more than 42m Globo shares and pledged 10m shares for a personal loan on the day Quintessential published its report.

      "bodyText": "A rash of discounting on the high street has failed to generate a Christmas frenzy over the weekend, with the number of shoppers down on last year. Many families are taking a four-day break before Christmas Day on Friday and shoppers appear to be taking their time to buy gifts. Some consumers are hanging on for last-minute bargains, meaning a nail-biting end to the season for the high street. Retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Debenhams are already offering significant discounts as mild weather has left them with piles of coats and knitwear, while security fears in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris are also thought to have kept shoppers at home. Steve Richardson, UK regional director at FootFall, which monitors shopper behaviour, said the rise of online shopping has also had an impact. With companies offering even later delivery deadlines for Christmas, and some promising same-day delivery or click &amp; collect right up until 24 December, online shopping is playing a bigger role in purchasing last-minute gifts. But Richardson said shoppers were likely to move to the high street on Monday. \u201cWe expect the Panic Monday shift \u2013 when consumers abandon online shopping and take to the streets, in a bid to ensure they tick off all the final gifts on their Christmas lists \u2013 to be even more pronounced this year,\u201d he said. FootFall is predicting that high street shopping will peak on Tuesday, while card provider Visa is predicting Wednesday will be the biggest day as shoppers pick up last-minute presents. Kevin Jenkins, managing director of Visa in UK and Ireland, said he expected shoppers to spend \u00a31.3bn in the two days before Christmas as people surged on to the high street at the last moment. \u201cAs consumers turn to their mobiles and tablets to take advantage of retailers\u2019 last-minute click and collect services in the run-up to the 23rd, retailers may also see a surge in footfall on the day, with the opportunity for further shopping in-store when consumers arrive,\u201d he said. The downbeat message echoes a survey by the CBI of 118 retailers earlier this month. It found that retail sales proved a disappointment after consumers appeared to save much of their bonus from improving wages and falling petrol prices. The CBI\u2019s monthly distributive trades survey, which covers the crucial run-up to Christmas, found that a decline in shoe sales were the main drag on the overall revenue figures while a \u201csolid performance\u201d from supermarkets, a boom in clothing sales and a boost from the Black Friday weekend kept the sector bouyant. Howard Archer, the chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said the CBI figures represented a \u201crelatively decent\u201d performance in a month when hopes of galloping wages growth evaporated. He said: \u201cWhile consumer confidence has come off the peak levels seen around midyear and earnings growth has slowed recently, the fundamentals still look largely healthy for consumers. \u201cPurchasing power is still relatively strong, employment is high and rising, and the recent renewed fall in petrol prices frees up more money for discretionary spending,\u201d he added. According to the latest official figures annual average earnings growth declined from 3% in the three months to September to 2.4% in October. But the slowdown still left earnings growth 2.3 percentage points above consumer price inflation of 0.1% in November. Additionally, employment was up 207,000 in the three months to October to reach a record high of 31.3 million, up 505,000 year on year.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK faces a showdown with Europe after being found to have breached the directive which introduced a crackdown on bankers\u2019 bonuses. The European Banking Authority reached the conclusion as the regulator delayed the final guidelines on implementation of the rules across the EU by a year to January 2017. It proposed a change to EU law to bring clarity to the treatment of smaller, less risky firms\u2019 bonuses. Britain could now face a battle with Europe over the cap \u2013 which the Bank of England and the UK government oppose \u2013 after the EBA found the UK had excluded hundreds of firms such as asset managers and brokers because they were not big enough to come under the EU\u2019s capital requirements directive. The cap, which limits bonuses for senior staff to 100% of salary or 200% if shareholders approve, is a long-running source of conflict between the UK and the EBA. It affects the UK more than other European countries because London is the continent\u2019s financial centre and hosts many highly paid investment bankers and other financial employees. Bonuses paid in cash for short-term gains were identified as one of the causes of the financial crisis because they rewarded traders and bank bosses for taking risks that could endanger their company. But the Bank of England has warned that the bonus cap increases risk by encouraging increases in salary and making it harder to claw back bonuses if things go wrong. James Perry, a partner at the law firm Ashurst, said the EBA\u2019s rules were counterproductive and that he expected the UK to continue to oppose the measure. \u201cThese rules are supposed to be about controlling risk, but firms like asset managers and brokers have very little risk on their balance sheets, so the bonus cap is being used to control risks that really don\u2019t exist. Firms will be forced to pay more fixed salary to compensate for the cap \u2013 so the upshot will be to create risk where there was none before.\u201d Previous rulings by the EBA have already forced changes on pay deals in the City after the regulator said that some top-up payments granted by banks \u2013 with the approval of the Bank of England \u2013 breached the bonus cap. These payments, often known as role-based pay, can only be excluded from the rule if they are not variable in any way. The EBA said it would support amending the EU directive to exclude small firms and employees paid bonuses that are insignificant relative to salary but that the cap itself should remain intact. It suggested the rules that require bonuses to be deferred over a number of years and the types of financial instruments in which bonuses can be paid should not be applied to small firms. Jon Terry, a partner and pay expert at accountants PwC, said the EBA had delayed implementation by a year to get the rules cleared up but that it wanted to do so as quickly as possible within the EU\u2019s often slow processes. He also pointed out that UK bank executives who receive bonuses in shares will not be eligible for dividends, reducing the value of bonuses by up to a quarter. \u201cIt appears current practices will apply for 2016, and the guidelines have simply provided a stay of execution until 2017,\u201d Terry said. The Bank of England said it noted the EBA\u2019s guidelines but that its views on the bonus cap were unchanged. A Bank spokesman said: \u201cFirms have increased fixed pay as a proportion of total remuneration, which reduces the flexibility of a firm\u2019s cost base and limits the ability to reduce such costs in adverse market conditions. It also reduces the capacity to use variable pay to incentivise positive risk cultures.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Oil has fallen to an 11-year low as traders took fright at the prospect of a glut caused by fresh supplies that will outstrip global demand. Brent crude prices dropped almost 2% to as low as $36.17 a barrel, the lowest since July 2004 and weaker than during the worst of the financial crisis. The price fell to $36.20 on Christmas Eve 2008 as the global economy headed for recession following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The price of the global benchmark nudged back up to $36.42 but prices were still below those of the previous trading day. Global production is hovering around a record high and the market faces fresh supplies from Iran as western sanctions are lifted and Iran seeks to win back customers from Saudi Arabia and Russia. Extra supplies are also looming from the US, where stockpiles are growing as extra drilling rigs are put into operation. Oil prices have fallen by more than two thirds since summer 2014 as demand has slowed with the global economy and higher production in the US and elsewhere has increased supplies. Prices revived partly in May but have almost halved since. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures, which show the value of the US benchmark, fell 36 cents to $34.37 a barrel, close to last week\u2019s 2015 lows. Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, slashed its 2016 Brent crude price forecast by $10 a barrel to $43 last week, highlighting excess supply and the re-entry of Iran to the global market. Some analysts are gloomier, predicting prices falling to near $20 a barrel. Opec said this month it had no plans to rein in production \u2013 a stance reiterated by Iraq\u2019s oil minister at the weekend. The Saudi-dominated bloc has pumped out hundreds of thousands of unwanted crude each day in an effort to hold on to its share of the market and force US shale producers out of business. Russian production has hit a post-Soviet record and the number of rigs deployed in the US rose for the first time in five weeks last week by 17 to 541, according to industry figures supplied by the driller Baker Hughes. Lukman Otunuga, an analyst at currency trader FXTM, said: \u201cSentiment towards WTI oil received a heavy blow as this latest increase in oil rig counts, combined with the consistent rise in crude oil inventories have led to intensifying concerns over the aggressive oversupply in the markets.\u201d Last week\u2019s increase in US interest rates has also put pressure on oil prices by strengthening the dollar and reducing the dollar price of commodities.",

    "webTitle": "UK government too slow to save steel industry, MPs conclude", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The UK government reacted too slowly to the crisis in the steel industry that has caused more than 5,000 job losses and left the sector permanently damaged, a parliamentary committee has said. Although the government viewed the steel industry as important, it did not respond to warning signals about its mounting problems, which included reduced demand, falling prices and dumping of cheap steel by China, according to a report backed by all MPs on the business, innovation and skills committee. When Sajid Javid, the business secretary, and other ministers woke up to the crisis, they did not do enough to keep plants open and instead concentrated on compensating workers affected. This led to a permanent loss of skills and the closure of plants that will never reopen. Iain Wright, the Labour chairman of the committee, said: \u201cThe steel industry is now on the verge of terminal decline. For too long the government failed to be alert to the alarms raised by the industry and act at home to maintain a steel industry in the UK when other European countries were acting to safeguard their own strategic steel industries.\u201d The closure of SSI\u2019s plant at Redcar on Teesside in October brought home the extent of the crisis. After almost 100 years in operation, Europe\u2019s second-biggest blast furnace shut with the loss of 1,700 jobs and wider consequences for the struggling local economy. Further job cuts and mothballing of plants followed at Tata Steel\u2019s sites in Scunthorpe and Scotland. Wright said: \u201cMy concern is that the government should have explored much more thoroughly options to keep the Redcar plant open to retain the industrial assets and the skills rather than washing its hands too quickly, allowing it to close down and inflict severe damage on future manufacturing capability. \u201cFailure to consider effective mothballing not only undermines capability for the UK steel industry in the future but could cost the taxpayer a fortune in clean-up costs.\u201d The committee said the problem of Chinese dumping needed to be resolved for the UK\u2019s steel industry to be viable and that the government did not push the European Union hard enough to repel dumping by China. The committee said steel\u2019s malaise was due to complacency by successive governments but that the current government was slow to act on proposals put forward by the sector, including relief from business rates and high energy bills, and greater government support when it buys steel for big projects. Wright said: \u201cThe government has relied on crisis management rather than ongoing engagement with the steel industry. Steel is a strategic industry and ministers have recognised its strategic importance. The inaction with steel doesn\u2019t bode well for other strategic industries if they were to face a crisis.\u201d The government should act quickly on the main proposals from the industry and should work with the sector in general to examine whether policy decisions threaten other important sectors, the MPs said. They called for a more active industrial policy and for the government to spell out how it will work to avoid a repeat of steel\u2019s problems. The business, innovation and skills department said the government had taken action on relief for energy costs, anti-dumping, procurement and European emissions directives. \u201cWhile the government is doing all it can to help the industry, the government cannot dictate the commercial decisions, operations or financial performance of private companies.\u201d The official rejected the committee\u2019s criticism over the government\u2019s handling of Redcar\u2019s closure and said SSI UK had suffered \u00a3600m of losses in three years and amassed high debts. \u201cIf the select committee had a magic bullet that could have saved the plant against these conditions, they certainly kept it to themselves,\u201d the official added.",

This led to a permanent loss of skills and the closure of plants that will never reopen. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/19/can-government-galvanise-the-ailing-uk-steel-industry\">Can the government save Britain's ailing steel industry?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Iain Wright, the Labour chairman of the committee, said: \u201cThe steel industry is now on the verge of terminal decline. For too long the government failed to be alert to the alarms raised by the industry and act at home to maintain a steel industry in the UK when other European countries were acting to safeguard their own strategic steel industries.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/12/redcar-steelworks-receiver-confirms-closure\">closure of SSI\u2019s plant at Redcar on Teesside in October </a> brought home the extent of the crisis. After almost 100 years in operation, Europe\u2019s second-biggest blast furnace shut with the loss of 1,700 jobs and wider consequences for the struggling local economy. Further <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/20/tata-steel-expected-to-announce-1200-job-losses-in-uk\">job cuts and mothballing of plants followed at Tata Steel\u2019s sites in Scunthorpe and Scotland</a>.</p> <p>Wright said: \u201cMy concern is that the government should have explored much more thoroughly options to keep the Redcar plant open to retain the industrial assets and the skills rather than washing its hands too quickly, allowing it to close down and inflict severe damage on future manufacturing capability.</p> <p>\u201cFailure to consider effective mothballing not only undermines capability for the UK steel industry in the future but could cost the taxpayer a fortune in clean-up costs.\u201d</p> <p>The committee said the problem of Chinese dumping needed to be resolved for the UK\u2019s steel industry to be viable and that the government did not push the European Union hard enough to repel dumping by China.</p> <p>The committee said steel\u2019s malaise was due to complacency by successive governments but that the current government was slow to act on proposals put forward by the sector, including relief from business rates and high energy bills, and greater government support when it buys steel for big projects.</p> <p>Wright said: \u201cThe government has relied on crisis management rather than ongoing engagement with the steel industry. Steel is a strategic industry and ministers have recognised its strategic importance. The inaction with steel doesn\u2019t bode well for other strategic industries if they were to face a crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The government should act quickly on the main proposals from the industry and should work with the sector in general to examine whether policy decisions threaten other important sectors, the MPs said. They called for a more active industrial policy and for the government to spell out how it will work to avoid a repeat of steel\u2019s problems.</p> <p>The business, innovation and skills department said the government had taken action on relief for energy costs, anti-dumping, procurement and European emissions directives.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the government is doing all it can to help the industry, the government cannot dictate the commercial decisions, operations or financial performance of private companies.\u201d</p> <p>The official rejected the committee\u2019s criticism over the government\u2019s handling of Redcar\u2019s closure and said SSI UK had suffered \u00a3600m of losses in three years and amassed high debts.</p> <p>\u201cIf the select committee had a magic bullet that could have saved the plant against these conditions, they certainly kept it to themselves,\u201d the official added.</p>",

      "bodyText": "British employers expect to keep hiring permanent staff in 2016 but are cautious about offering meaningful pay rises, according to a survey from employers\u2019 group CBI. In its annual employment outlook, the lobby group said some companies are also contemplating price hikes or recruitment freezes to offset higher labour costs from both the introduction of the \u201cnational living wage\u201d in April and a new apprenticeship levy. The CBI has called the changes the most significant interventions in the labour market since Tony Blair\u2019s government introduced the minimum wage and other employment laws in the late 1990s. The business group also reiterated its scepticism over the likely effectiveness of the apprenticeship levy, which was confirmed in George Osborne\u2019s autumn statement. \u201cWe live in an era of significant labour market interventions,\u201d said CBI director for employment and skills, Neil Carberry. \u201cThe UK\u2019s labour market is in fine fettle, though it\u2019s clear that maintaining flexibility is of the utmost importance to employers. Companies are concerned about the apprenticeship levy and view it as a payroll tax, so the CBI is determined to work with the government to ensure that businesses see their money is spent in the best way.\u201d The CBI\u2019s survey of 342 employers, covering almost 1 million employees, found nearly half \u2013 47% \u2013 anticipated the new levy would be \u201ccostly and bureaucratic\u201d. But the survey was conducted between August and October, before Osborne confirmed details of the levy at 0.5% of an employer\u2019s payroll, applying to companies with an annual wage bill of more than \u00a33m. The government hopes the levy will help it hit a target of 3m apprenticeship starts by 2020. Business groups repeatedly complained about skills shortages this year but at the same time expressed reluctance to pay the apprenticeship levy. Carberry said employers surveyed by the CBI had expressed support for the aims of a levy and for funding it, but that there were worries the government wanted to hit targets for a quantity of apprenticeships rather than focusing on quality. The CBI\u2019s employment survey, conducted with consultancy firm Accenture, reprises the theme of skills shortages, with respondents saying they were the top threat to the UK\u2019s attractiveness as a place to do business for the second year running. The poll cited businesses\u2019 rising concerns over getting the skilled workers they need as the economy heads towards full employment. More than two in five businesses, or 43%, expect their workforces to be larger in 12 months\u2019 time while 13% expect their workforce to be smaller, according to the the survey. The number of new permanent jobs will outstrip temporary roles, the poll suggested. In the coming year, more than half of businesses, or 52%, said they intended to raise pay at least in line with the retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation, which was 1.1% in November. That was little changed from the 55% planning to match or beat RPI in the same survey a year ago. Asked about the national living wage, which will push up the minimum hourly rate for workers aged 25 or older from \u00a36.70 to \u00a37.20, two-fifths of firms anticipated some impact. Of those employers who feel the national living wage will have an impact, 34% anticipate having to raise prices. More than a quarter, 28%, said they will be employing fewer people as a consequence. In the services sector, which includes businesses that tend to rely more on cheaper labour such as hotels and retailers, the expected effect on prices is more pronounced. Of those service sector employers who feel the national living wage will have an impact, 51% anticipate having to raise prices, 27% said they would employ fewer people and 18% said they would offset costs through changes to wider reward packages.",
