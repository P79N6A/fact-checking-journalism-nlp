      "bodyText": "Bonuses for Britain's business leaders are falling for a third year as companies feel the need to be fair to their workforces, according to consulting group PwC. Its survey of 43 FTSE 100 companies with financial years ending since September shows that a chief executive can expect an average bonus of \u00a31.14m this year. It said the recovery and rising stock market have not translated into higher performance-related payouts, which are down by 1% on 2012, and that basic pay is also being restrained. PwC said nearly a quarter of FTSE 100 companies that have reported so far have frozen their chief executive's salary and that pay increases, at less than 3%, have been largely been in line with the rest of the workforce. It added that a third of companies believe their remuneration committee's pay decisions are more focused on fairness between executives and the wider workforce because of new disclosure rules. Median total pay, including long-term incentive payouts, increased by just 0.5% for chief executives who were in the job in both years. PwC said its research suggested that the trend for moderate pay increases and bonus payouts would continue in the medium term, as more than half (60%) of organisations expect the overall level of senior executive pay to be within 10% of current levels over the next five years. Tom Gosling, head of PwC's reward practice, said: \"The 2014 annual meeting season is shaping up to be another year of restraint. Despite fears that executive pay inflation would take off again as the economy recovers, this doesn't seem to be the case. Executives are seeing only modest salary increases and bonuses continue to fall. Remuneration committees are approaching any increase in pay-outs with caution to ensure they accurately reflect performance and satisfy shareholders.\"",

I am deeply sorry.\u201d<br></p> <p>\"We told the world we had a problem that needed to be fixed,\" Barra said. \"We did so because whatever mistakes were made in the past, we will not shirk from our responsibilities now and in the future. Today's GM will do the right thing.\"<br></p> <p>GM has asked former US attorney Anton Valukas to conduct a \u201cthorough and unimpeded investigation,\u201d said Barra. \u201cThe facts will be the facts. Once they are in, my management team and I will use his findings to help assure this does not happen again. We will hold ourselves fully accountable,\u201d said Barra.</p> <p>Her testimony was released as <a href=\"http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2014/mar/0331-power-steering.html\">GM called in another 1.3m cars</a> including older model Chevrolet Malibus, the Saturn Aura and the Pontiac G6, over steering issues. The company said a chime would alert owners if their steering is compromised. \u201cSteering control can be maintained because the vehicle will revert to manual steering, but greater driver effort would be required at low vehicle speeds, which could increase the risk of a crash,\u201d said GM.<br></p> <p>GM now expects its recall-related repairs announced to cost $750m this quarter, up from a previously disclosed $300m charge.<br></p> <p>The latest recall comes after the House committee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/31/general-motors-executives-congress-recall-scandal\">said over the weekend</a> that its investigations had found regulators had declined to open formal investigations into complaints about GM cars on two occasions, and that GM dropped plans for a fix in 2005 because it would have taken too long and cost too much money.<br></p> <p>Government officials have been examining more than 200,000 pages of documents from GM and approximately 6,000 pages from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), whose acting administrator David Friedman will also appear before the House committee. On Wednesday, the two will talk to a Senate panel.<br></p> <p>The committee found that in 2007 the federal regulator decided not to open an inquiry even after its own investigators had identified four fatal crashes, 29 complaints and 14 other reports related to ignition issues and problems with disabled air bags in Chevrolet Cobalts and other cars.<br></p> <p>The agency again declined to open a full investigation after more issues with air bags surfaced in 2010.</p> <p>According to the committee\u2019s timeline, GM knew of issues with the ignition switches in pre-production models of the Saturn Ion in 2001. In November 2004, GM engineers reported that ignition defects meant Chevrolet Cobalts could be \"keyed off with knee while driving\".<br></p> <p>But in March 2005, a GM project engineering manager closed an investigation into the issue, saying the \"lead time for all solutions is too long\", \"the tooling cost and piece price are too high\" and none of the proposed fixes \"represents an acceptable business case\".<br></p> <p>\u201cThe documents produced to the committee to date do not explain the criteria for an \u2018acceptable business case\u2019 and how the decision was made in this case,\u201d the committee said in its memo.<br></p> <p>Instead of issuing a recall, GM issued a bulletin to dealers with the subject line: \u201cInformation on Inadvertent Turning Off of Key Cylinder, Loss of Electrical System and No DTCs [diagnostic trouble code].\u201d</p> <p>The bulletin informed dealers about the ignition issue and recommended potential remedies including removing heavy items from key rings.</p> <p>Earlier this month the families of three teenagers killed or injured in a 2006 car crash involving a 2005 Cobalt sued GM for negligence and fraud for not disclosing facts about the defects. </p> <p>Natasha Weigel, 18, and Amy Rademaker, 15, died in the crash. Megan Phillips, the car's driver, suffered permanent brain damage.</p> <p>The lawsuit is one of hundreds that GM could potentially face over fatalities linked to ignition and air bag issues. Barra said earlier this month that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/18/gm-safety-chief-car-recall\">terrible things</a>\u201d had happened at the company.</p> <p>Over the weekend the NHTSA said it had \u201creviewed data from a number of sources in 2007, but the data we had available at the time did not warrant a formal investigation.\u201d The agency said it is \"aggressively investigating\" the recall and new information provided by GM. In his testimony, Friedman said: \u201cGM had critical information that would have helped identify this defect.\u201d</p> <p>David Johnson, the chairman of crisis management consultancy Strategic Vision, said this week\u2019s hearings represented high stakes for GM and Barra. \u201cThis is very damaging in the short-term for GM \u2013 they have been trying to demonstrate that they are a new company after the bailout. For Barra, it is going to be about what she knew, and when. When did she find out about these issues, and what did she do?\u201d</p>",

Barra is preparing to tell Congress that she still has no clear idea what went wrong at GM, \u201cbut I can tell you that we will find out.\u201d The GM boss offers \u201csincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall \u2026 especially to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry.\u201d \"We told the world we had a problem that needed to be fixed,\" Barra said. \"We did so because whatever mistakes were made in the past, we will not shirk from our responsibilities now and in the future. Today's GM will do the right thing.\" GM has asked former US attorney Anton Valukas to conduct a \u201cthorough and unimpeded investigation,\u201d said Barra. \u201cThe facts will be the facts. Once they are in, my management team and I will use his findings to help assure this does not happen again. We will hold ourselves fully accountable,\u201d said Barra. Her testimony was released as GM called in another 1.3m cars including older model Chevrolet Malibus, the Saturn Aura and the Pontiac G6, over steering issues. The company said a chime would alert owners if their steering is compromised. \u201cSteering control can be maintained because the vehicle will revert to manual steering, but greater driver effort would be required at low vehicle speeds, which could increase the risk of a crash,\u201d said GM. GM now expects its recall-related repairs announced to cost $750m this quarter, up from a previously disclosed $300m charge. The latest recall comes after the House committee said over the weekend that its investigations had found regulators had declined to open formal investigations into complaints about GM cars on two occasions, and that GM dropped plans for a fix in 2005 because it would have taken too long and cost too much money. Government officials have been examining more than 200,000 pages of documents from GM and approximately 6,000 pages from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), whose acting administrator David Friedman will also appear before the House committee. On Wednesday, the two will talk to a Senate panel. The committee found that in 2007 the federal regulator decided not to open an inquiry even after its own investigators had identified four fatal crashes, 29 complaints and 14 other reports related to ignition issues and problems with disabled air bags in Chevrolet Cobalts and other cars. The agency again declined to open a full investigation after more issues with air bags surfaced in 2010. According to the committee\u2019s timeline, GM knew of issues with the ignition switches in pre-production models of the Saturn Ion in 2001. In November 2004, GM engineers reported that ignition defects meant Chevrolet Cobalts could be \"keyed off with knee while driving\". But in March 2005, a GM project engineering manager closed an investigation into the issue, saying the \"lead time for all solutions is too long\", \"the tooling cost and piece price are too high\" and none of the proposed fixes \"represents an acceptable business case\". \u201cThe documents produced to the committee to date do not explain the criteria for an \u2018acceptable business case\u2019 and how the decision was made in this case,\u201d the committee said in its memo. Instead of issuing a recall, GM issued a bulletin to dealers with the subject line: \u201cInformation on Inadvertent Turning Off of Key Cylinder, Loss of Electrical System and No DTCs [diagnostic trouble code].\u201d The bulletin informed dealers about the ignition issue and recommended potential remedies including removing heavy items from key rings. Earlier this month the families of three teenagers killed or injured in a 2006 car crash involving a 2005 Cobalt sued GM for negligence and fraud for not disclosing facts about the defects. Natasha Weigel, 18, and Amy Rademaker, 15, died in the crash. Megan Phillips, the car's driver, suffered permanent brain damage. The lawsuit is one of hundreds that GM could potentially face over fatalities linked to ignition and air bag issues. Barra said earlier this month that \u201cterrible things\u201d had happened at the company. Over the weekend the NHTSA said it had \u201creviewed data from a number of sources in 2007, but the data we had available at the time did not warrant a formal investigation.\u201d The agency said it is \"aggressively investigating\" the recall and new information provided by GM. In his testimony, Friedman said: \u201cGM had critical information that would have helped identify this defect.\u201d David Johnson, the chairman of crisis management consultancy Strategic Vision, said this week\u2019s hearings represented high stakes for GM and Barra. \u201cThis is very damaging in the short-term for GM \u2013 they have been trying to demonstrate that they are a new company after the bailout. For Barra, it is going to be about what she knew, and when. When did she find out about these issues, and what did she do?\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "One of the world's biggest manufacturing companies diverted more than $8bn in profits to Switzerland in order to avoid US taxes, according to investigators working for the Senate. Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment, allegedly avoided paying more than $2.4bn in US taxes over a decade by striking a deal with Swiss tax authorities to pay as little as 4% on the profits from its lucrative international spare parts business through a Geneva-based subsidiary. Though the practice of basing such subsidiaries offshore is widespread among multinationals, and Senate investigators refused to say whether they believe the company broke US tax law, the elaborate accounting strategy appears to take so-called 'transfer pricing' practices to new extremes. The report, which was produced by the Senate subcommittee on investigations under chairman Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, claims that 85% of Caterpillar\u2019s international profits from selling parts \u2013 its most profitable activity \u2013 were routed through its Swiss subsidiary, even though the vast majority of associated manufacturing, research and employment remained in the US. \u201cCaterpillar is an American success story that produces phenomenal industrial machines, but it is also a member of the corporate profit-shifting club that has shifted billions of dollars in profits offshore to avoid paying US taxes,\u201d Levin told reporters in a briefing on Capitol Hill. \u201cThe manufacturing workers who make world-class parts, the managers who operate its parts operations, the warehouses where they are stored \u2013 none of that changed,\u201d he added. \u201cBut in the fantasy land that is international tax law, tax lawyers waved a magic wand to make millions of dollars in US taxes disappear.\u201d Executives from Caterpillar, some of whom will appear before the Senate committee on Tuesday to testify publicly on the strategy, insist that its Swiss affiliate performs \u201cvaluable intangible services\u201d. But Levin's staff claim that a senior tax official at the company previously testified under oath, after receiving a subpoena from the committee, that there was no business advantage to the arrangement other than tax avoidance. The congressional investigation was sparked by a whistleblower who sued Caterpillar in 2011 for demoting him, allegedly after he raised internal concerns about the practice. The company eventually settled out of court with the whistleblower, Daniel Schlicksup, who was a global tax strategy manager for Caterpillar from 2005 to 2008. In a statement issued by the Illinois-based company on Monday, Caterpillar described its tax arrangements as \u201cprudent and lawful business planning that is common among responsible US multinational corporations\u201d. \u201cCaterpillar takes very seriously its obligation to follow tax law and pay what it owes,\u201d finance services vice-president Julie Lagacy said in the statement. \u201cIn fact, Caterpillar\u2019s effective income tax rate averages about 29%, which is one of the highest for a US multinational manufacturing company. Caterpillar\u2019s philosophy is that our business structure drives our tax structure. We comply with the tax laws enacted by Congress, by the states and by all of the many jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\u201d The Senate's investigation of tax avoidance by US multinationals, which has previously targeted companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, has been criticised by some Republicans, who say that it demonises corporate America. And Arizona Republican senator John McCain, for one, disagrees with some of the Democrat-controlled committee\u2019s conclusions on Caterpillar, Levin said. At a hearing last May, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the only long-term solution to the issue is to lower US tax rates, thereby encouraging multinationals to repatriate profits that build up off shore in their international businesses. Levin said Caterpillar\u2019s accounting, which according to the report it paid $55m to PriceWaterhouseCoopers to develop, is particularly aggressive because so much of the company's parts business is clearly based in the US and other high-tax jurisdictions, rather than at its Swiss subsidiary, which was previously just a regional dealer prior to the strategy being implemented in 1999. In their report, committee investigators say that Caterpillar Inc in the US is home to 4,900 parts employees, 54 manufacturing facilities and 10 warehouses storing and shipping 1.5bn parts around the world. The Swiss subsidiary, on the other hand, employs just 65 staff and is home to no parts manufacturing or warehouses, the report claims. Levin has introduced a bill in the Senate that would, if passed by Congress, close perceived loopholes in current tax rules governing how multinationals are required to account for profits channeled through subsidiaries.",

      "body": "<p>In a modern mill in a small industrial estate in the textile town of Bury, Lancashire, more than 100 whirring machines roll out 11m metres of high strength fabric every year. When parts of the plant were built in the mid-19th century there would have been 4,000 workers at its rows of looms \u2013 today, machines are still weaving, but the workforce is just over 100.</p> <p>The specialist cloth for Milliken European Airbag Products can be found in most big car brands, but as the plant's vice-president Graham Swann likes to say: \"Hopefully you will never see one of our products.\"</p> <p>This factory is one of a few to have survived industrial decline in the region. It has become a model for high value manufacturing within its US parent company, the 150-year-old <a href=\"http://www.milliken.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Milliken</a>. Colleagues visit from Milliken's chemicals and textiles plants around the world to learn how this fabric maker has consistently beaten its productivity targets.</p> <p>Its rising efficiency will be a source of comfort for ministers and of envy to so many other firms in the UK struggling to increase their productivity. It has become an important question for economists and policymakers, as Britain struggles to keep up with competition from rapidly industrialising countries like China as well as high value manufacturing markets like the US. But the latest official UK data today is expected to show little improvement from the sluggishness of recent years.</p> <p>For Swann, a textile engineer with Milliken for 27 years, the downturn has been a driver of productivity growth, or what he calls \"doing more with less and more with what you have got\".</p> <p>\"The old school was if you reached a bottleneck you reached for new equipment and invested. Recent times have taught us that you need to look at your existing equipment,\" he says over the constant hum from the weave room behind him.</p> <p>The plant's productivity growth, which it measures in metres-per-man-hour and other ways, has ramped up over the last seven years under what Milliken calls a \"lean journey\", referring to a Japanese production philosophy that seeks to eliminate waste. That starts with the morning meeting \u2013 always standing, never sitting, and with a target time of 10 minutes. \"It usually lasts eight,\" says Swann. \"Meetings are a great way of wasting time if you are not careful.\"</p> <p>Another Japanese concept, Kanban, is used to cut unnecessary stockpiling and tries to match inventories with demand.

      "bodyText": "In a modern mill in a small industrial estate in the textile town of Bury, Lancashire, more than 100 whirring machines roll out 11m metres of high strength fabric every year. When parts of the plant were built in the mid-19th century there would have been 4,000 workers at its rows of looms \u2013 today, machines are still weaving, but the workforce is just over 100. The specialist cloth for Milliken European Airbag Products can be found in most big car brands, but as the plant's vice-president Graham Swann likes to say: \"Hopefully you will never see one of our products.\" This factory is one of a few to have survived industrial decline in the region. It has become a model for high value manufacturing within its US parent company, the 150-year-old Milliken. Colleagues visit from Milliken's chemicals and textiles plants around the world to learn how this fabric maker has consistently beaten its productivity targets. Its rising efficiency will be a source of comfort for ministers and of envy to so many other firms in the UK struggling to increase their productivity. It has become an important question for economists and policymakers, as Britain struggles to keep up with competition from rapidly industrialising countries like China as well as high value manufacturing markets like the US. But the latest official UK data today is expected to show little improvement from the sluggishness of recent years. For Swann, a textile engineer with Milliken for 27 years, the downturn has been a driver of productivity growth, or what he calls \"doing more with less and more with what you have got\". \"The old school was if you reached a bottleneck you reached for new equipment and invested. Recent times have taught us that you need to look at your existing equipment,\" he says over the constant hum from the weave room behind him. The plant's productivity growth, which it measures in metres-per-man-hour and other ways, has ramped up over the last seven years under what Milliken calls a \"lean journey\", referring to a Japanese production philosophy that seeks to eliminate waste. That starts with the morning meeting \u2013 always standing, never sitting, and with a target time of 10 minutes. \"It usually lasts eight,\" says Swann. \"Meetings are a great way of wasting time if you are not careful.\" Another Japanese concept, Kanban, is used to cut unnecessary stockpiling and tries to match inventories with demand. This goes for stationery in the office as well as supplies and production on the shop floor. \"If the customer stopped ordering today and we have material, we stop production,\" says Swann. But that does not mean downtime for employees; they simply report to their \"continuous improvement leader\" and get redeployed to other work. The plant has four of these, which in times past would have been known as shift leaders. Workers can come to them with ways to improve productivity. \"It could simply be someone feels they could work better on one side of a machine rather than the other,\" says Swann. Changes since 2007 have increased output by 12%, the equivalent of 10 weaving machines. Ministers know that raising productivity \u2013 what the UK can squeeze out of every hour worked and pound invested \u2013 is key to maintaining economic growth, now the low-hanging fruit of the early recovery is all but harvested. So far, the news has been disappointing. In 2012, productivity fell as the labour market grew faster than output. Last year, it was more stable as output recovered but was still weaker than policymakers had been expecting. On manufacturing productivity growth alone, the UK performs better than many other countries, but the sector is only a tenth of the economy.

      "bodyText": "Illegally traded python skins worth $1bn (\u00a3600m) are being imported into Europe every year as weak regulation fails to stop illicit traders capitalising on demand for the dramatically patterned leather. Half a million skins are imported legally each year from south-east Asia, most of them destined for Italy, Germany and France, where they are made into designer handbags, shoes and belts. Legal imports have grown from 350,000 skins valued at just \u20ac100m (\u00a382.6m) in 2005 to $1bn today as Beyonc\u00e9, Johnny Depp's partner, Amber Heard, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tamara Ecclestone have jumped on the trend for the exotic handbags, which can sell for more than \u00a34,000 each. But the black market in skins is thought to be worth about the same amount again, amid widespread circumventing of international agreements to limit the number of pythons taken from the wild. In its first report on how to improve the international trade and protect pythons, the Python Conservation Partnership, backed by the owner of Gucci \u2013 Kering \u2013 and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, said python farms could be part of the answer. \"This report offers [an] alternative solution to the sourcing of python skins for which demand is escalating. However, there is still some way to go towards more transparent, better-managed python farming,\" said Jean-Christophe Vi\u00e9, deputy director of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's global species programme. \"We must make sure that attention is not diverted from the urgent need to preserve wild pythons and their habitats through direct site conservation and action against illegal trade.\" In the past, farming of south-east Asia's reticulated python (Python reticulatus) and Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus) \u2013 two of the world's largest snakes \u2013 had been dismissed as uneconomic because pythons were thought to take too long to mature and to be too difficult to feed and breed in captivity. The report said commercial farms do exist in China, Vietnam and Thailand. It recommends this industry could be improved with the introduction of better monitoring, more humane slaughter techniques and the urgent development of technology such as DNA or isotope testing to help identify whether a skin is farmed or taken from the wild. Such tests could help prevent the \"laundering\" of illegally caught wild pythons through farms. That practice is thought to be so widespread that the report says that all supposedly farmed python skin from Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia and Malaysia should be treated with caution as there is little proof that farms exist in these countries. Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer at Kering, said that demand for python skin accessories was rising at Gucci, especially from Asia, and so it was keen to ensure a sustainable source of supply. \"Our objective is to be sure that we don't put in danger these two species of python and their eco-system,\" she said. The company currently buys farmed and wild-caught skins certified under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) scheme from Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Daveu said that there needed to be a balance between ethically farmed pythons and the trade in wild python skins, which provided jobs for local communities that could support the protection of the reptiles in their own habitat. But she admitted: \"Today there is no way to be fully sure where the skin has come from.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 1 April to reinstate the value of the legal trade in python skins",

In its first report on how to improve the international trade and protect pythons, the Python Conservation Partnership, backed by the owner of Gucci \u2013 Kering \u2013 and the <a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/\" title=\"\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>, said python farms could be part of the&#xa0;answer.</p> <p>\"This report offers [an] alternative solution to the sourcing of python skins for which demand is escalating. However, there is still some way to go towards more transparent, better-managed python farming,\" said Jean-Christophe Vi\u00e9, deputy director of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's global species programme. \"We must make sure that attention is not diverted from the urgent need to preserve wild pythons and their habitats through direct site conservation and action against illegal trade.\"</p> <p>In the past, farming of south-east Asia's reticulated python (<em>Python reticulatus</em>) and Burmese python (<em>Python molurus bivittatus</em>) \u2013 two of the world's largest snakes \u2013 had been dismissed as uneconomic because pythons were thought to take too long to mature and to be too difficult to feed and breed in captivity.</p> <p>The report said commercial farms do exist in China, Vietnam and Thailand. It recommends this industry could be improved with the introduction of better monitoring, more humane slaughter techniques and the urgent development of technology such as DNA or isotope testing to help identify whether a skin is farmed or taken from the wild. Such tests could help prevent the \"laundering\" of illegally caught wild pythons through farms. That practice is thought to be so widespread that the report says that all supposedly farmed python skin from Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia and Malaysia should be treated with caution as there is little proof that farms exist in these countries.</p> <p>Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer at Kering, said that demand for python skin accessories was rising at Gucci, especially from Asia, and so it was keen to ensure a sustainable source of supply. \"Our objective is to be sure that we don't put in danger these two species of python and their eco-system,\" she said.</p> <p>The company currently buys farmed and wild-caught skins certified under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) scheme from Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.</p> <p>Daveu said that there needed to be a balance between ethically farmed pythons and the trade in wild python skins, which provided jobs for local communities that could support the protection of the reptiles in their own habitat. But she admitted: \"Today there is no way to be fully sure where the skin has come from.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 April to reinstate the value of the legal trade in python skins</p>",

But with Samaras ousting one of his own MPs for also breaking ranks, Venizelos stopped short of expelling either Papandreou or veteran Pasok MP Apostolos Kaklamanis for rejecting the bill.

The Fed's Chair clearly states that the labour market is far from being out of the woods despite the 6.7% unemployment rate as part of it is due to lower participation rate. More help on the labour market is needed, without undermining inflation expectations. At the moment, wage growth still remains depressed despite the improved labour market.

And we have been purchasing large quantities of longer-term securities in order to put additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates--the rates that matter to people shopping for a new car, looking to buy or renovate a home, or expand a business. There is little doubt that without these actions, the recession and slow recovery would have been far worse. </p> <p> These different measures have the same goal--to encourage consumers to spend and businesses to invest, to promote a recovery in the housing market, and to put more people to work. Together they represent an unprecedentedly large and sustained commitment by the Fed to do what is necessary to help our nation recover from the Great Recession. For the many reasons I have noted today, I think this extraordinary commitment is still needed and will be for some time, and I believe that view is widely shared by my fellow policymakers at the Fed. </p> <p> In this context, recent steps by the Fed to reduce the rate of new securities purchases are not a lessening of this commitment, only a judgment that recent progress in the labor market means our aid for the recovery need not grow as quickly. Earlier this month, the Fed reiterated its overall commitment to maintain extraordinary support for the recovery for some time to come. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-aaa35b61-6931-419a-af13-01f2112c99c5\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/31/1396278883702/0bc1673f-fbe9-4f20-a1b8-74a323a9e570-460x310.jpeg\" alt=\"Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen speaks at the National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference.

      "bodyText": "Early enthusiasm on hopes of action by the European Central Bank on Thursday to tackle the prospect of deflation had faded by the end of the day, leading most markets in negative territory. But the US was boosted by the dovish comments from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, suggesting the bank's stimulus measures would be needed for a while yet. Here are the closing scores: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 17.21 points or 0.26% lower at 6598.37 \u2022 Germany's Dax was down 0.33% at 9555.91 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.45% lower at 4391.50 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB bucked the trend, adding 0.9% to 21,691.92 \u2022 Spain's Ibex also edged higher, up 0.11% at 10,340.5 On Wall Street the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently 150 points or 0.91% higher. On that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back again tomorrow. Over to Greece where following parliament\u2019s tumultuous vote in the early hours, the government is now having to deal with the fall-out. Helena Smith reports from Athens: The government\u2019s parliamentary majority now whittled down to 152, the vote may have passed but the fault-lines are there. With three MPs (including former prime minister George Papandreou) having abstained from backing the ballot, prime minister Antonis Samaras and his junior coalition leader have announced they will meet tonight to pick up the pieces and prepare for the two-day meeting of EU finance ministers that begins in Athens on Tuesday. The abstentions have caused particular embarrassment for the government \u2013 not least that of ex-socialist leader Papandreou who reportedly had shown no sign that he would reject a key reform outlining the recapitalisation of Greek banks in the multi-bill. MPs who voted for the legislation \u2013 despite their own hesitations \u2013 are enraged that the man who called in the IMF to save Greece ultimately refused to endorse the measures demanded as the price of aid. In an excoriating statement, the deputy prime minister and socialist Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos lambasted Papandreou saying: \u201cHypocrisy and personal political games are what led this country and the political system to today\u2019s situation.\" Papandreou, no fan of the man who usurped his position, responded with a word-by-word repetition of the same statement. But with Samaras ousting one of his own MPs for also breaking ranks, Venizelos stopped short of expelling either Papandreou or veteran Pasok MP Apostolos Kaklamanis for rejecting the bill. The fragile political stability comes as the government prepares to host all-important eurogroup and Ecofin meetings in Athens over the coming days. As was the case with similar visits by German chancellor Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, it is not taking any chances announcing a lockdown of the capital \u2013 and ban on public gatherings - from 6am until 11pm on Tuesday and Wednesday in addition to draconian security measures around all government buildings. Earlier talk that the European Central Bank might act on Thursday to curb the threat of deflation had given markets an early lift. But that buoyancy is fading now as the idea gains ground that the ECB will keep thing unchanged, despite the fall in eurozone inflation to 0.5% in March. Both Germany's Dax and France's Cac are now in negative territory (the latter not helped by the uncertainty caused by the French local elections.) Back in the UK, and Friday's slump in insurance shares after the badly handled announcement of a review of the sector by the Financial Conduct Authority was not the watchdog's finest hour. That is the admission from under fire FCA chief executive Martin Wheatley, speaking to the City Week 2014 conference. He said (courtesy Reuters): Whenever markets move like they did on Friday there is always scrutiny. This was clearly not the FCA's finest hour but it does serve as a timely reminder to all parties involved of the care and thought that is needed when handling significant amounts of information we hold as part of going about our business. The FCA has announced an external lawyer will look at how the watchdog released the news, while Andrew Tyrie, chair of the Treasury select committee, said its actions seemed to be an extraordinary blunders. Janet Yellen of course sent shudders through the markets at the Fed's press conference earlier this month, by suggesting the bank could raise interest rates six months after it ended its current bond buying programme. Now, says Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy, Yellen has tried to clarify that statement: When Yellen mentioned \u201caround six months\u201d as a possible time frame, the market started to price in an early start of the hiking cycle. As expected, Yellen now tries to re-calibrate market expectations, making clear that Fed has the extraordinary committment to support the economic recovery Such comments seem to suggest that the \u201csix months\u201d framework hinted in mid-March is more like the minimum time the Fed is willing to wait (before starting to hike) rather than a precise timing. The tapering of the ongoing QE is not going against such committment. Yellen emphazises the conditionality of policy guidance during today\u2019s speech. The Fed's Chair clearly states that the labour market is far from being out of the woods despite the 6.7% unemployment rate as part of it is due to lower participation rate. More help on the labour market is needed, without undermining inflation expectations. At the moment, wage growth still remains depressed despite the improved labour market. Such a condition suggests that underlying inflationary pressures are still tame and low Fed Funds for a prolonged period of time cannot lead to spiking inflation expectations. Yellen's comments about stimulus measures being needed for some time have given a lift to markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average now more than 140 points higher. Here are the paragraphs from Yellen's speech about the stimulus measures the Fed has been taking, following comments about how there are still not enough jobs available for people who want to work: Since late 2008, the Fed has taken extraordinary steps to revive the economy. At the height of the crisis, we provided liquidity to help avert a collapse of the financial system, which enabled banks and other institutions to continue to provide credit to people and businesses depending on it. We cut short-term interest rates as low as they can go and indicated that we would keep them low for as long as necessary to support a stronger economic recovery. And we have been purchasing large quantities of longer-term securities in order to put additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates--the rates that matter to people shopping for a new car, looking to buy or renovate a home, or expand a business. There is little doubt that without these actions, the recession and slow recovery would have been far worse. These different measures have the same goal--to encourage consumers to spend and businesses to invest, to promote a recovery in the housing market, and to put more people to work. Together they represent an unprecedentedly large and sustained commitment by the Fed to do what is necessary to help our nation recover from the Great Recession. For the many reasons I have noted today, I think this extraordinary commitment is still needed and will be for some time, and I believe that view is widely shared by my fellow policymakers at the Fed. In this context, recent steps by the Fed to reduce the rate of new securities purchases are not a lessening of this commitment, only a judgment that recent progress in the labor market means our aid for the recovery need not grow as quickly. Earlier this month, the Fed reiterated its overall commitment to maintain extraordinary support for the recovery for some time to come. US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen is speaking at the National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference in Chicago. Here are the early Reuters snaps: 31-Mar-2014 14:51 - FED'S YELLEN: EXTRAORDINARY COMMITMENT TO STIMULUS WILL BE NEEDED FOR SOME TIME, A VIEW WIDELY SHARED BY FELLOW POLICYMAKERS 31-Mar-2014 14:51 - YELLEN: ECONOMY STILL 'CONSIDERABLY SHORT' OF FED'S GOALS; WILL TAKE TIME TO REACH 31-Mar-2014 14:51 - YELLEN: CONSIDERABLE SLACK REMAINS IN ECONOMY, LABOR MARKET 31-Mar-2014 14:51 - YELLEN: CUTS TO BOND BUYING NOT A LESSENING OF COMMITMENT, BUT REFLECTION OF SOME LABOR MARKET PROGRESS 31-Mar-2014 14:51 - YELLEN: QE CUTS SHOW 'AID FOR THE RECOVERY NEED NOT GROW AS QUICKLY' 31-Mar-2014 14:51 - YELLEN POINTS TO PART-TIME WORKERS AS EVIDENCE LABOR CONDITIONS WORSE THAN SUGGESTED IN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 31-Mar-2014 14:51 - YELLEN: LABOR MARKET SLACK HAS HELD DOWN COMPENSATION 31-Mar-2014 14:51 - YELLEN: RECOVERY STILL FEELS LIKE A RECESSION TO MANY AMERICANS The full speech is here: What the Federal Reserve is Doing to Promote a Stronger Job Market Hot off the wires: \"Janet Yellen noting considerable slack in economy, labour market, sees economy needs extraordinary support for some time.\" My colleague Nick Fletcher will bring you more on this story... Thank you for following and for all your comments so far. US stock markets have opened higher, ahead of a speech by central bank governor Janet Yellen. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.7%, the Nasdaq 0.8% and the S&amp;P index 0.6%. On the last day of the first quarter of 2014, market watchers are expecting another quarter of gains. I don't have any details on the Yellen speech but will see what I can find. The Wall Street Journal reports that the next installment of Portugal's bailout has been delayed until June, comfortably after the European elections. The IMF, one of the country's creditors, said the delay was necessary to see how Portugal had implemented the conditions attached to an earlier part of the rescue. As the paper notes, this frees up eurozone finance ministers meeting in Athens tomorrow to concentrate on Greece's bailout. European ministers have considered extending a precautionary credit line to Portugal to help it leave the bailout. But Germany rejected this idea, according to an unnamed official in the WSJ report. It would require going back to the Bundestag and there is not much excitement [in the German government] about this. Perhaps one of the eurozone understatements of the year so far? Read the full article here I've got more details on the IMF's 'too big to fail' warning from the Guardian's economics correspondent, Phillip Inman. His article flags up the fund's view that banking regulations being devised in different jurisdictions could end up being \"mutually destructive\". A week before vital meetings of G20 ministers in Washington, it said efforts such as the Dodd-Frank Act and the Vickers report in the UK limited the scope for banks to embark on reckless lending and need a taxpayers' bailout in the event of them going bust. But in its Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF said the impact of a bank crash would be still be severe and could destabilise the international financial system. It said: In areas such as the implementation of resolution frameworks or structural reforms, countries have adopted policies without much co-ordination. These solo initiatives, even though individually justifiable, could add unnecessary complexity to the regulation and consolidated supervision of large cross-border institutions and encourage new forms of regulatory arbitrage. Western banks are still too big too fail, with institutions in UK banks benefitting from an implicit taxpayer subsidy worth $110bn, according to the International Monetary Fund. Banks in the eurozone were boosted by subsidies ranging from $90bn-$300bn in 2013, according to the fund's regular Global Financial Stability report, while US banks were helped to the tune of $20bn to $70bn. The total taxpayer guarantee amounts to $590bn. The too big to fail problem actually became worse after the financial crash, the IMF said. Countries emerged from the financial crisis with an even bigger problem: many banks were even larger than before and so were the implicit guarantees.\ufeff More to follow\ufeff... Ukraine's currency, the hryvnia, has weakened against the dollar today, after the central bank removed currency controls following last week's deal on a $14-$18bn bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The country's finances are under huge pressure with almost $10bn of foreign-currency debt needing to be serviced this year. Researchers at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels think \"it is not impossible for Ukraine to overcome its macroeconomic crisis\". In the context of an IMF programme, the country could significantly reduce the twin deficits in the medium term, accompanied by the necessary funds to finance the deficits in the short term. Additional funds from the EU and the USA are certainly welcome. A key issue in this respect is the price of energy for the population, which in some cases covers only 16% of the import and distribution costs. A gradual but decisive increase in energy prices is a necessary condition for fiscal consolidation in the short term, but also for current account sustainability in the medium term. Such a move would also reduce dependence on Russia and decrease the widespread corruption in the energy sector. But this assumes that a steady rise in energy prices and the IMF's tough economic reforms are accepted by the people of Ukraine. Read the full analysis here. While France is struggling to cut its debt, Portugal reduced its budget deficit to 4.9% of GDP in 2013, beating the 5.5% target set by its international lenders. The budget deficit is set to fall further to 4% this year. However, total debt to GDP rose to 129% in 2014, while this year's forecast - 126.8% - will still be higher than 2012. Market watchers have praised Portugal as a model pupil of the international bailout school. So it's worth pointing out that unemployment is running at 15% while youth unemployment remains staggeringly high at 38%. You can see the statistics here. George Osborne's speech, where he committed the Conservatives to full employment, is being covered on the Guardian's politics live blog. Some economics watchers don't think the goal is stretching enough. The Bank of England defines full employment as a jobless rate of 5%. The UK is currently at 7.2% behind Germany. Europe's response to the global economic and financial crisis has raised questions about democracy in the EU and led to the dismantling of some of the social protections once seen as the pinnacle of European achievement, a charity has said. The report, which examines the human cost of the crisis in Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain, accuses European leaders of failing to respond to mass unemployment and other social costs, while they mostly protect the interests of bank creditors - with a \"no bondholder left behind\" policy. Henry McDonald, the Guardian's Ireland correspondent, has been analysing the Irish figures. Here is his report from Dublin Almost one third of Irish people in the Republic's lowest income bracket are in financial distress in terms of loans, mortgages, credit card repayments and other debt, a pan European survey of poverty reveals today. And nearly a fifth of all Irish children are 'at risk' of falling into poverty according to a new report on seven EU countries hit the hardest by the recession. But the lowest Irish wage earners are better off in their jobs compared to the poorest in the six other EU states, the study published in The Economic Crisis and its Human Cost - A Call for Fair Alternatives and Solutions. While 10% of the low paid workers in six of the other European countries are suffering from poverty, the figure for Irish employees in the same income level was just 5% The report was released in Dublin this morning by the think tank Social Justice Ireland, which has been consistently critical of the IMF-European Central Bank-imposed austerity cuts over the last four years. The focus on Irish poverty levels and their economic impact is part of a wider survey by the Caritas organisation which also studied deprivation rates in Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania and Spain. On debt and its effect on the poorest in the Republic, the report says more than 30% of the most deprived are mired in debt. In terms of child poverty the study found that 17% of all Irish children risk falling into the poverty trap. Sean Healy, the Director of Social Justice Ireland accused the Irish and other EU countries of delaying economic recovery by insisting on austerity policies. The failure of the EU and its members states to provide concrete support on a scale required to assist those experiencing differences, to protect essential public services and to create employment is likely to prolong the crisis.\" These latest poverty figures demonstrate that while a significant proportion of the Irish population still struggles with debts consumer spending and domestic demand also remain the biggest drag on the Republic's economic revival. The full report is available here. In last week's TV debate, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage clashed over how many jobs were associated with the UK's membership of the European Union. The Liberal Democrat leader put the figure at 3m, but research published today suggests 4.2m jobs, 13% of the UK workforce, are tied to exports to the EU. This compares to 3.7m jobs in 1997, according to the report from the Centre for Economics and Business Research. The biggest growth has been in professional, technical, business and admin jobs, while manufacturing industry - against the backdrop of production shifting to China - has shed jobs. In a familiar part of the tale, London was the region that gained the most jobs, while the West Midlands is the only part of the country that has fewer EU-linked jobs than it did in 1997 ( 385,000 jobs in 2014). The researchers stress they are not suggesting all these jobs would be lost if the UK pulled out of Europe. Will the European Central Bank pump money into the ailing eurozone economy? That is the question tantalising economists as they count down to an ECB meeting on Thursday. European interest rates are at historic lows, but the ECB has so far declined to start quantitative easing ( printing money) But data showing that prices are falling faster than expected has raising fears of deflation, raising expectations that the bank will have to act. Still, plenty of economists think the bank is unlikely to act on Thursday. Capital Economics thinks temporary factors, late Easter, explain the fall in prices, as holidays and consumers goods are discounted. Meanwhile, remarks by Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and ECB board member, have also dampened speculation of early action. At a conference in Berlin on Saturday, Weidmann said: Monetary policy should respond to such factors only in the event of second round effects. meaning customers are not delaying purchases because they fear prices will fall. With regard to the rate of inflation at the moment, the euro area is not in a self-enforcing downward spiral of price decreases, which is nominally the definition of deflation. Russia's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has promised to create a special economic zone in Crimea offering tax breaks and reduced bureaucracy to woo investors. Medvedev has been touring schools and hospitals in Crimea and is the most senior member of the Russian government to visit so far. He kept the presidential seat warm for Vladimir Putin in 2008-12, but his plans to create a special investment zone near Moscow and tackle corruption came to naught. With Crimea needing massive investment in its water and electricity systems, investors are likely to be sceptical. Another word on mortgage approvals. Capital Economics thinks the decline in approvals could ease fears that the housing market is overheating. It may, therefore, be an early sign that pent-up demand released by the launch of Help to Buy and the broader economic recovery is being exhausted. Nevertheless, with the economic recovery likely to strengthen and the recent Help to Buy extension set to underpin demand, approvals are likely to rise further over the next few months, although perhaps at a slower rate than in the past six months. But there is a sting in the tail on household debt. Yet at the same time, [the figures] will do little to ease policymakers\u2019 concerns that too many households are overstretching themselves by taking loans based on historically high multiples of income. Ed Conway of Sky News has found more bad news for savers. It is a data-packed morning. The Bank of England has released statistics showing a slight slowdown in mortgage approvals in February, while business lending declines. Mortgage approvals were 70,309 in February, down from 76,753 in October, and the lowest level since last October. Does this mean the recovery in the housing market is slipping? Probably not. Here is Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight it is highly likely that mortgage activity was held back appreciably in February by the very wet weather and flooding, so the dip in approvals does little to dilute the view that the housing market is sustaining robust momentum. In fact, at 70,309 in February, mortgage approvals were still up 33.8% year-on-year. While it is \"premature\" to talk of a housing bubble, he says there is a very real risk one could develop.\ufeff Many expect the lower-than-expected inflation will heighten pressure on the European Central Bank to do more to help the currency bloc's struggling economies. Here is the breakdown of eurozone inflation data. Inflation for the bloc was below forecast and has reached its lowest level for four and a half years. The March figures are estimates and you can see the full release here Breaking news: eurozone inflation falls to 0.5% in March. As noted below the line, the FT has an interesting story on UK tax revenues, which brings disappointing news for George Osborne. The paper has found that tax proceeds have consistently fallen short of expectations and suggests that taxes have become more difficult to collect, or the Treasury and Office for Budget Responsibility are too optimistic. Here is a flavour Despite all the efforts to raise more revenues through taxation, FT figures show that the OBR has had to rein back its optimism on tax proceeds almost every year since starting work in 2010. The OBR originally hoped the tax system would collect revenues worth 38.8 per cent of national income in the coming 2014-15 tax year, a figure that has progressively been revised down to 37 per cent. The full article is here. In a speech today, Osborne is promising to unveil the most important tax changes for a generation. Our politics live blog has full coverage. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is having bad day. After his Socialist party suffered terrible results in Sunday's local elections, he has learnt that the government is behind track on its plans to cut the public debt. Statistics from Insee show that the public deficit fell to 4.3% of gross domestic product in 2013 from 4.9% the previous year. But the government had promised the rest of the EU it would cut the deficit to 4.1%. Gross public debt rose to 93.5% of GDP from 90.6%. The economy grew by 0.3% in the final months of 2013, driven by exports and household consumption. Better than last time, but many will say, not good enough for the eurozone's second-largest economy. Germans opened their wallets and hit the shops in February, according to the latest data. Statistics from the Federal Statistics Office showed a 1.3% jump in retail sales in February, compared to the previous year. This was the second monthly increase and way better than economists had forecast. Germany has been relying more on domestic demand, as the eurozone crisis has weighed on its exports. Deutsche Welle has more details The biggest driver was the sale of clothing, shoes and leather goods, which surged by 6.1%. Almost equally successful was the sale of pharmaceutical and medical products, while trade in household appliances and food items was sluggish throughout February. British insurance companies still rising... The president of the eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, is sounding optimistic about Cyprus, one year after the financial crisis that pushed the island to the verge of bankruptcy. I think there will be difficult times ahead, and yet I think there will be a new perspective for the economy of Cyprus. I think the economy of Cyprus has shown to be dynamic and flexible, and therefore I am optimistic that Cyprus will recover within a short period of time. But there wasn't much sympathy for Cypriot savers who had to foot the bill for recapitalising the country's banks. The bail-in applied to savers with more than \u20ac100,000 in their account with deposits at Cyprus's two largest banks. Over the weekend, the departing governor of the Cypriot central bank, Panicos Demetriades, said the IMF could have drawn up a narrower bail-in targetting savers at just one bank. In an interview with Reuters, Demetriades said This would have limited the shock to confidence and would have made it easier for Cyprus to recover. Although, not withstanding the big shock, we are already showing early signs of recovery. He also warned any escalation in the Ukraine crisis could damage Cyprus, which is popular with Russian tourists. It sounds as if it was a bruising session in the Greek parliament last night, with lawmakers trading accusations of treachery over the economic reform plan, eventually voted through with a majority of just two votes. The government came perilously close to losing, after one of its own deputies voted against one of the measures. In a curious detail, the government was saved by a concession on long-life milk. Ekathimerini reports The government had been concerned about a rebellion from some of its own MPs but appears to have appeased them by making a last minute change to its provision for the shelf-life of pasteurized milk, which was reduced to seven days from the proposed nine. Until now, it had been five days. On the last day of the first quarter of 2014, there is plenty of optimism about stocks. The main continental indices are also up this morning. Germany's DAX +0.4% France's CAC40 +0.42% Italy's FTSE MIB+0.28% The FTSE 100 is up 0.58% in early trading, helped by a rise in value of British insurance companies after Friday's heavy losses. RSA +0.8% Aviva +1% Resolution +1.7% On Friday, the UK financial regulator was forced to issue an urgent clarification of its plans, after a report, and clarify it did not intend to review 30m policies sold between 1980 and 2000. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and the business world. Greek lawmakers have voted for a controversial set of reforms that will pave the way for the next tranche of its bailout aid. The vote means hundreds of liberalising laws that the Greek government had already agreed with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund will be written into Greek law. The package was agreed shortly after midnight on Monday, leaving the government with a majority of just two. Ekathimerini describes a tension-filled day in the chamber, when deputies from the leftist Syriza party walked out after failing to get the bill delayed. Any delay would have been a huge headache for the government, as agreeing the package was seen as essential for eurozone ministers meeting on Tuesday in Athens, to give the go-ahead to disbursing the next tranche of bailout funds - vital to get loans to repay \u20ac9.3bn of debt maturing in May. Here is the reaction from both sides Prime Minister Antonis Samaras \u201cA huge step toward the Greece of tomorrow, for young Greeks, for the Greek people.\u201d Syriza's leader Alexis Tsipra Today, Samaras' government is pushing the Greek economy and Greek people deeper into the grave. I\u2019ll bring you more reaction and look ahead to the meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday. Also on our agenda today: EU inflation data is likely to show that prices across the bloc rose by 0.6% in March - this would be the six month in a row when inflation was below 1% - posing a problem for the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday. There is plenty more about\u2026 so stay tuned.",

In a positive note on the sector, analysts at Societe Generale said:</p> <blockquote> The market seems to have over-reacted on Friday to a leaked announcement from the UK's FCA which initially suggested far-reaching reforms could be on the agenda in a summer review on legacy products. However, the reality is less dramatic, with the FCA now confirming the review will not seek to remove exit charges on the vast majority of legacy products.

Babcock International, under pressure recently in the wake of its near \u00a31bn purchase of helicopter group Avincis, added 55p to \u00a313.47 after the engineering services group, alongside US partner Fluor, was appointed preferred bidder for a \u00a37bn, 14 year contract to manage the decommissioning of 12 UK nuclear sites. A number of insurers recovered some ground after Friday's confusion over watchdog FCA's investigation into pensions and savings plans. Aviva added 6.8p to 477p, while Resolution rose 2.5p to 298.8p. In a positive note on the sector, analysts at Societe Generale said: The market seems to have over-reacted on Friday to a leaked announcement from the UK's FCA which initially suggested far-reaching reforms could be on the agenda in a summer review on legacy products. However, the reality is less dramatic, with the FCA now confirming the review will not seek to remove exit charges on the vast majority of legacy products. Aviva and Legal &amp; General both have low exposure at 8% and 7% of total earnings. We suggest Friday's price reaction (closed down 3%) represents a good entry point into Aviva and Prudential. The FCA review is unlikely to be as far reaching and aggressive as initially feared. We think panic had set into the market following the pension reforms in the UK budget last week \u2013 which were unexpectedly far reaching. Nevertheless we recommend investors stay clear of closed book consolidators until visibility improves further. We think Aviva and Prudential are best placed to contend with the review as the former has low earnings exposure to with-profits business and the latter has one of the best such funds. However Prudential ended down 12p at 1268.5p. Elsewhere GlaxoSmithkline lost 26.5p to 1591.5p after disappointing drug trial results. Its darapladib treatment for heart disease failed the main goal of a phase 3 study, but the co-chair of the trial said there could still be benefits. Dr Harvey White said: While the study didn't meet its primary endpoint, the effects of darapladib on the reduction of coronary events are of potential interest. Continuing talk of further stimulus from the Chinese authorities to boost the country's economy lifted mining shares again. Rio Tinto rose 58p to 3337.5p while Anglo American added 17.5p to 1526.5p. Arm climbed 20.5p to 998p after a positive note from analysts at Barclays, who raised their target price on the chip designer from \u00a311.25 to \u00a312. After Friday's news of a competition inquiry into the sector, energy companies had another mixed day. SSE slid 42p to \u00a314.69 but Centrica closed 1.1p higher at 329.7p. Lower down the market TEG, the Aim-listed green technology company which operates composting and energy plants, dropped 6% to 3.875p after a 12.5% drop in full year profits and no final dividend. The company has appointed Leo McKenna, a specialist in public private partnerships, as its chairman. Analysts at the company's broker N+1 Singer said: As expected, the key reason for the year on year decline in revenues was the drop off in activity from TEG's engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts, following the end of the Manchester contract and delays in completing the Gaydon project. Despite an encouraging outlook statement, management expect tougher trading conditions for the operations division in 2014 through increased competition, which we believe increases the importance of the company generating income from its EPC division. The release of the significant cash retentions related to the Manchester contracts will also be important for the company in 2014.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Western governments have put in place banking regulations that could be \"mutually destructive\" and undermine efforts to prevent bust banks from costing taxpayers billions of pounds, according to a report by the International Monetary Fund. Policymakers representing the world's biggest financial centres have failed to make the banking sector stand on its own feet by ending implicit subsidies and co-ordinating rescue plans when multinational banks go bust, the Washington-based lender of last resort said. In a hard-hitting report, it accused policymakers of falling short in their efforts to protect taxpayers from banks that are still too big to fail. Subsidies to the banking sector in some countries are as high as they were before the crash, amounting to $590bn (\u00a3355bn), with the eurozone the worst affected. The IMF praised efforts to make banks more secure, particularly by forcing them to hold more capital and through rules that restrict them from making risky loans. It said the US had limited its implicit subsidy to the banking sector to $70bn (\u00a342bn) at most. A week before vital meetings of G20 ministers in Washington, it said efforts such as the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and the Vickers report in the UK limited the scope for banks to embark on reckless lending and then need a taxpayers' bailout if they went bust. But in its Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF said the impact of a bank crash would still be severe and could destabilise the international financial system. It said the implicit subsidy for banks in the eurozone could be as much as $300bn (\u00a3181bn). It said Basel III rules that force banks to hold more capital should be implemented alongside more co-ordination of international rules. \"In areas such as the implementation of resolution frameworks or structural reforms, countries have adopted policies without much co-ordination. These solo initiatives, even though individually justifiable, could add unnecessary complexity to the regulation and consolidated supervision of large cross-border institutions and encourage new forms of regulatory arbitrage,\" it said. \"In the case of resolving cross-border banks, local initiatives may well end up being mutually destructive. For example, attempts to ringfence the assets of failed internationally active banks are considered a factor behind the increasing financial fragmentation in Europe.\" France, Spain and Canada have seen a series of rescue mergers since 2008 that have left more than 60% of bank assets in the hands of three mega-banks. In a warning shot, the IMF said the distress or failure of one bank could bring down a country's entire financial system. Nevertheless, it warned there were costs to reducing the size of systemically important banks, as many MPs in the UK have proposed. Other methods of reducing the impact on taxpayers were likely to give a more clear-cut benefit, it said, including greater co-ordination of existing rules. The report is likely to strengthen the hand of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as it seeks to broker a deal over new global banking standards this year. Given the role by the G20, the FSB wants to establish commonly agreed rules for dealing with banks that could suffer the same fate as Lehman Brothers and jeopardise the financial system. FSB head Mark Carney, who is also the Bank of England's governor, has met resistance from several banks, especially in the US. Carney is expected to press ahead with plans to bring greater co-ordination to bank regulation, though the European Union has yet to complete its banking union and investor groups remain fearful that banks will play one regulator off against another in the event of an impending bankruptcy. The FSB is concerned that investors will pull the plug on banks that look vulnerable to having their assets in effect seized in some jurisdictions and not others.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's booming housing market took a breather in February, according to the latest mortgage approvals figures, as bad weather forced some buyers to stay indoors. Business lending also suffered a knock after Bank of England data showed that bank loans to the corporate sector declined against January figures. The mortgage figures are likely to reassure regulators, which have expressed fears that the housing market is close to over-heating and pricing first-time buyers out of the market in London and the south-east. House prices are up more than 10% by some measures and Bank governor Mark Carney has warned he may be forced to tighten regulations to stop the market boiling over. Analysts had expected a small decline in the number of transactions following the severe flooding and rain that affected much of the UK last month, but the sharp fall to 70,309 from 76,753 in January was the biggest drop in more than six years and took the number of sales back to levels not seen since last October. Ed Stansfield, chief property analyst at Capital Economics, said the fall in transactions was enough to reverse almost all of the gains seen over the past three months, confirming the weaker picture already painted by the British Bankers' Association last week. He said: \"Although likely to be temporary, today's sharp fall in mortgage approvals should go some way towards calming fears that the housing market recovery is rapidly spiralling out of control.\" Stansfield said a trend was difficult to discern, but \"the dip in approvals does seem consistent with surveys showing that the pace of buyer inquiries has moderated since the turn of the year. \"It may, therefore, be an early sign that pent-up demand released by the launch of Help to Buy and the broader economic recovery is being exhausted.\" Rob Wood, chief UK economist at investment bank Berenberg, said credit was \"not the be-all and end-all of economic recovery\" after declines in business lending and a slowdown in mortgage approvals failed to dent GDP growth. \"Credit is not a constraint on households' or firms' spending any more.

      "bodyText": "A review of how firms can prevent traders manipulating key benchmarks in a bid to stop a new Libor scandal and an investigation into how lenders treat borrowers who have fallen behind on repayments are among the City regulator's plans for the year ahead. The publication of the Financial Conduct Authority's business plan comes days after it came under fire for its handling of an investigation into closed pension and life insurance funds. It was forced to announce an external investigation after news that it would look into the companies' treatment of long-standing customers caused dramatic falls in their share prices. The chairman of the Treasury select committee, Andrew Tyrie, said the way the regulator released the information \u2013 via a press interview \u2013 appeared to be an \"extraordinary blunder\", and the Sunday Times reported that insurers were planning to write to the chancellor (\u00a3) George Osborne, to complain. Amid the clamour, the FCA on Monday confirmed it would be looking into the industry: \"We will assess whether firms are operating historic (often termed 'legacy' or 'heritage') products in a fair way and whether they have adopted strategies that exploit existing customers.\" The regulator highlighted its plans for a thematic review of whether firms have learned lessons from Libor and other recent controversies and set adequate controls on traders' behaviour to prevent future manipulation of benchmark rates. \"Following widespread attempted manipulation of Libor, firms should ensure that traders are not able to act in this way in the future,\" the FCA's chief executive, Martin Wheatley, said. \"We are determined that firms need to take the matter of manipulation of any benchmark seriously and will be working with firms to seek out any issues that may remain.\" The FCA takes over regulation of the consumer credit sector on Tuesday, and it also outlined plans for a review of how struggling borrowers are treated by the industry, and how loans are advertised. It has already signalled that it plans to get tough on the payday lenders that offer short-term loans at high interest rates, with new restrictions set to come into force in July, and it said it planned to visit the top five firms to check they are following the rules. Wheatley said: \"Taking on the regulation of consumer credit is an enormous task which effectively doubles the number of firms we regulate. \"Using our new power we want to tackle harm to consumers who are most at risk and our work will focus on protecting vulnerable consumers.\" Other reviews outlined in the plan include: \u2022 How banks have implemented rules on selling packaged bank accounts introduced in March 2013 \u2022 The impact on consumers of cost-cutting exercises such as withdrawing paper statements \u2022 Whether victims of unauthorised transactions are treated fairly \u2022 Sales practices at retirement \u2022 How lenders are treating interest-only mortgage customers \u2022 Possible conflict of interest in wealth management firms where customers buy in-house investments The FCA also set out its budget for the year ahead, saying it needed \u00a3446.4m to fund its work, an increase of 3.3%, or \u00a314.3m, on the current year's costs. It said the minimum fee for companies would be \u00a31,000 for the fifth year running and that 42% of firms would only pay that figure.",
