Unnamed senior government ministers told ABC\u2019s Lateline on Thursday that Holden will cease operating in Australia after 65 years of production. A Productivity Commission report into the future of the automotive industry is underway, with preliminary findings expected on 20 December and the final report on 31 March, and a decision on government funding was expected to influence Holden\u2019s decision to stay. Citing \u201cseveral senior government figures\u201d, ABC political editor Chris Uhlmann said Holden intends to quit Australia \u201cas early as 2016\u201d, regardless of the report, if the government does not make a decision before Christmas. The closure would take with it about 1,700 jobs in South Australia and up to 50,000 in knock-on effects around the country. Industry minister Ian Macfarlane denied any such decision had been made, a statement backed up by the opposition\u2019s industry spokesman, Kim Carr. ACTU national secretary Dave Oliver told Guardian Australia the council is \u201cextremely disappointed that we\u2019ve now got government ministers backgrounding journalists on the demise of Holden when no such decision has been made\u201d. \u201cThis is now creating a lot of uncertainty across the industry and more importantly a lot of uncertainty for the Holden workers who are waking up to the news this morning that they may have lost their jobs, when that\u2019s not the case,\u201d said Oliver. He said the prime minister now had an opportunity to \u201cput money where his mouth is\u201d and announce co-investment to secure Holden and the auto industry. \u201cThe prime minister has a choice. He can simply stand by on the sidelines and wait for a Productivity Commission inquiry that could turn into a Productivity Commission inquest, or come out now before Christmas [and] make the announcement that he\u2019s prepared to make the funding that will secure the tens of thousands of jobs in Holden and the associated supply industry,\u201d said Oliver. Carr told reporters in Canberra on Friday morning that the prime minister has \u201creal responsibilities\u201d to intervene personally. He said that the government has done \u201call they can to avoid making a decision\u201d on funding Holden, and called for it to deliver certainty to the industry. \u201cThere\u2019s been no formal decision made at this point, but the whole issue is on a knife edge,\u201d said Carr. Carr said he was in no doubt that if Labor had won the election, contracts would have been signed by now. He said a deal had been done under Labor with the company but it wasn\u2019t signed off because Holden wanted to hold off until after the election. \u201cThe government has known for a long time what the timetable is,\u201d he said. In June, Fairfax reported General Motors Holden director of government affairs Matt Hobbs saying that without further financial assistance beyond 2020 from the government, GMH would pull out. In a submission to the Productivity Commission, Holden said a globally competitive, long-term policy was needed to keep Australian automotive manufacturing alive. \"Without public assistance, Holden's local manufacturing cannot compete globally,\" the submission said. South Australian senator Nick Xenophon told ABC on Friday morning that if Holden quit \u201cthe supply chain would collapse\u201d. \u201cOther countries give a lot more assistance per capita to the automotive industry because they see the advantage in having a viable automotive industry,\u201d he said. \u201c$2bn is a lot of money over 10 years but what is the cost of welfare payments that the government would have to dish out?\u201d he said, referencing the potential 50,000 job losses.

      "standfirst": "Office for Budget Responsibility says cuts to services \u2013 and higher taxes for middle-income workers \u2013 are a key element of the government's aim of generating a budget surplus by 2018", 
      "body": "<p>Steep cuts in government spending over the next six years will shrink state services back to a level not seen since 1948, according to the government's spending watchdog.</p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility said reductions in Whitehall's departmental budgets will see government spending as a proportion of national income tumble to 16.1% from 23.2% in 2009.</p> <p>In a statement that alarmed public sector unions and anti poverty groups, it said that the cuts to services were a key element of the government's aim of generating a budget surplus by 2018.</p> <p>Instead of spending rising in line with projections of sustained increases in GDP over the next five years, cuts to core state activities will reach a post-war low. Longer term spending on pensions and other welfare budgets, while limited by raising the state pension age and a welfare cap, will continue to rise.</p> <p>The OBR said public sector net borrowing, which measures the gap between what the government spends and raises in revenue, will decline by an extra \u00a319.3bn as a result of an extra \u00a35.2bn of savings across Whitehall and \u00a314.6bn of previously unexpected tax receipts.</p> <p>Robert Chote, the head of the OBR, said most of the rise in tax receipts would come from stamp duty on house sales \u2013 a tax which has already provided an extra \u00a31bn more than forecast this year. In 2010 stamp duty on homes was worth little more than \u00a37bn to the Treasury's coffers after a fall from \u00a314bn at the peak in 2008. By 2018 it will be worth more than \u00a315bn a year, some \u00a33.5bn more than expected in March this year.</p> <p>Chote said the OBR's analysis showed the UK's sluggish recovery will be too weak to tackle the structural debts incurred before and after the financial crash. He said the recovery was slowly taking Britain back to its previous peak level of output, but without the structural changes, including rises in investment and exports, that would propel it forward at a faster pace.</p> <p>In a significant hit to middle income families, the OBR also said forecasts of a budget surplus in five years time relied on a jump in income tax receipts from workers pushed into the 40p tax rate band. As wages rise in the second half of the next parliament, a freeze on tax thresholds will push hundreds of thousands of households into the higher rate band \u2013 effectively doubling the rate of tax they pay on extra earnings.</p> <p>A dramatic reduction in the size and capability of government spending is likely to spark a debate on the nature of the state and the level of safety net it provides for those unable to find work.</p> <p>Analysts said the Treasury had effectively conceded that growth will not be strong enough in the second half of the decade to reduce the deficit and only spending cuts allied to tax hikes on middle income workers will fill the gap.</p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the OBR's downbeat economic forecasts are likely to conservative and allow the chancellor to cut personal taxes ahead of the general election.

      "bodyText": "Steep cuts in government spending over the next six years will shrink state services back to a level not seen since 1948, according to the government's spending watchdog. The Office for Budget Responsibility said reductions in Whitehall's departmental budgets will see government spending as a proportion of national income tumble to 16.1% from 23.2% in 2009. In a statement that alarmed public sector unions and anti poverty groups, it said that the cuts to services were a key element of the government's aim of generating a budget surplus by 2018. Instead of spending rising in line with projections of sustained increases in GDP over the next five years, cuts to core state activities will reach a post-war low. Longer term spending on pensions and other welfare budgets, while limited by raising the state pension age and a welfare cap, will continue to rise. The OBR said public sector net borrowing, which measures the gap between what the government spends and raises in revenue, will decline by an extra \u00a319.3bn as a result of an extra \u00a35.2bn of savings across Whitehall and \u00a314.6bn of previously unexpected tax receipts. Robert Chote, the head of the OBR, said most of the rise in tax receipts would come from stamp duty on house sales \u2013 a tax which has already provided an extra \u00a31bn more than forecast this year. In 2010 stamp duty on homes was worth little more than \u00a37bn to the Treasury's coffers after a fall from \u00a314bn at the peak in 2008. By 2018 it will be worth more than \u00a315bn a year, some \u00a33.5bn more than expected in March this year. Chote said the OBR's analysis showed the UK's sluggish recovery will be too weak to tackle the structural debts incurred before and after the financial crash. He said the recovery was slowly taking Britain back to its previous peak level of output, but without the structural changes, including rises in investment and exports, that would propel it forward at a faster pace. In a significant hit to middle income families, the OBR also said forecasts of a budget surplus in five years time relied on a jump in income tax receipts from workers pushed into the 40p tax rate band. As wages rise in the second half of the next parliament, a freeze on tax thresholds will push hundreds of thousands of households into the higher rate band \u2013 effectively doubling the rate of tax they pay on extra earnings. A dramatic reduction in the size and capability of government spending is likely to spark a debate on the nature of the state and the level of safety net it provides for those unable to find work. Analysts said the Treasury had effectively conceded that growth will not be strong enough in the second half of the decade to reduce the deficit and only spending cuts allied to tax hikes on middle income workers will fill the gap. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the OBR's downbeat economic forecasts are likely to conservative and allow the chancellor to cut personal taxes ahead of the general election. But there was little room for a spending splurge while debts remained historically high, he said, leaving the Osborne to rely on the Bank of England to keep interest rates low to propel growth. \"With debt still high it is clear that the bulk of future fiscal improvements will have to go into strengthening the government's finances. Against this background, the onus will remain heavily on Mark Carney and his monetary policy committee colleagues to keep the economic recovery on track.\" The OBR said the rise in VAT to 20% played the largest part in reducing the deficit in the first half of the parliament, while increases stamp duty and subsequently income tax receipts will add to the increase in income during the second half and into the next parliament. \"Around 20% of the deficit reduction [is] from higher receipts, with the majority of the increase having taken place by 2012-13, largely as a result of the increases in the standard rate of VAT. This is followed by further increases towards the end of our forecast due to the resumption of fiscal drag, as above-inflation earnings growth pushes more income into higher tax brackets,\" it said.

Blockbuster, the film rental chain, was paying almost 10% of its turnover in business rates, said Moorfields Recovery Service on Thursday.

And, since the Treasury could set the rate to ensure local authorities received the same sums, the government's failure to order immediate reform is baffling. The issue is \"on the agenda\" for the 2017 revaluation, said George Osborne. Until then, it seems, the plan is to distribute modest tax-breaks for small high-street retailers.

If it happens, the mystery is solved \u2013 bosses were just waiting for recovery to materialise and for consumers to become more confident. If business investment doesn't take off, though, it's time to take seriously the alarming explanation advanced by the likes of economist Andrew Smithers that bonus-driven executives have become risk-averse and prefer the sugar-rush of share buy-backs over projects with long-term benefits. If that's the structural impediment to investment, the government faces a big challenge.

The most important news was on liquidity, as Draghi revealed that the ECB is studying a new framework where funding to banks is made conditional to lending activity. The updated macroeconomic projections were largely in line with our expectations, indicating ongoing moderate economic recovery amid low inflation.</p> <p>&#xa0;In the Q&amp;A session, Draghi revealed that the ECB is studying a new framework to provide liquidity to banks and repair the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. This new tool, which will be deployed if needed, will differ from the three year LTROs, on the basis of the current much more favorable market environment and the acknowledgement that most of the three year liquidity pumped into the system between the end of 2011 and early 2012 did not reach the real economy, but was rather used to purchase government bonds (according to Draghi, this also contributed to delaying the restructuring of the banking sector). This is the first time that Draghi comes out with an explicit message on such an important feature of a potential new liquidity-providing operation, and what we learned today is very much in line with our long-held view on this topic.</p> <p>Although Draghi was careful to state that this is only one of the possible tools the ECB can deploy, we have little doubt that in the next few months the need for additional liquidity support will arise. We still think that this will happen in the first quarter of 2014, shortly after the US Federal Reserve announces its intention to start tapering. This means that the ECB still has some time to fine-tune the technical details. As Draghi openly acknowledged today, translating the idea into practice is the most difficult part of the job.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T16:53:44.796Z\">at 4.53pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a0a855e4b0a8ed49b80811\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T16:26:24.000Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bill Gross, founder of investment management group Pimco. has been talking about markets and the Federal Reserve's next step on its economic stimulus programme:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DailyFXTeam/statuses/408628536681832449\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>PIMCO&#39;s Gross: all asset prices are elevated artificially.</p>&mdash; DailyFXTeamMember (@DailyFXTeam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyFXTeam/statuses/408628536681832449\">December 5, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Forex_Beat/statuses/408628637219303424\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>PIMCo&#39;s Gross: Payrolls may allow Fed to talk about tapering [JC] <a href=\"http://t.co/NO02pDFXtQ\">http://t.co/NO02pDFXtQ</a></p>&mdash; FXBeat (@Forex_Beat) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Forex_Beat/statuses/408628637219303424\">December 5, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/livesquawk/statuses/408629028497522688\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>PIMCO\u2019s Gross: Fed Likely To End QE At End Of 2014, Focus On Guidance - Speaking on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BloombergTV\">@BloombergTV</a></p>&mdash; Live Squawk (@livesquawk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/livesquawk/statuses/408629028497522688\">December 5, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DanBTIG/statuses/408629774668427264\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>*FED `WANTS OUT&#39; OF BOND BUYING, PIMCO&#39;S GROSS SAYS - This is pretty clear at this point and we agree.

It seems highly possible that any future LTRO would be tailored specifically towards bank lending. Mr. Draghi indicated that if there was another LTRO, the ECB would want to make sure that it was not hoarded by banks or used to buy government bonds which largely happened with the two previous LTRO\u2019s.</p> <p>It is possible that the ECB will eventually go down the negative deposit interest rate route but we suspect they would prefer not to and will only do so if inflation falls appreciably further.&#xa0;We also suspect Quantitative Easing will prove to be too controversial a policy within the Governing Council to get adopted. Meanwhile, we expect the ECB to keep its refinancing rate at 0.25% through to 2015, although it is not inconceivable that it could trim it to 0.1% or even 0.0%.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52a09c55e4b0edee9fa3e85b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T15:37:08.408Z\">3.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>As ECB boss Mario Draghi promised earlier, the central bank has released <a href=\"http://t.co/8epNxznb3U\">details of its economic projections (PDF).</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f900ee50-3fb8-4268-9feb-6584adb51766\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/5/1386258093562/488aa627-b195-4539-b4e1-0e3bc9d1ba50-348x420.png\" alt=\"ECB forecasts\" width=\"348\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB forecasts Photograph: ECB</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's even a fan-chart as beloved of the Bank of England's inflation report:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8ef0b80a-72cd-4010-9555-a47b69257b1c\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/5/1386257689269/08a2f642-7d45-4e0d-af14-4e6ea275e7c1-460x335.png\" alt=\"ECB inflation\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB inflation and GDP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And a comparison of forecasts from various sources:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2ee0d65f-ccf0-4db5-a382-3b8e3ae41b3a\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/5/1386257790076/2a6cff58-b91e-403d-8ce4-58322ba7485c-460x235.png\" alt=\"ECB forecasts\" width=\"460\" height=\"235\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ECB forecast comparisons Photograph: /ECB</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T15:44:15.047Z\">at 3.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a09723e4b0edee9fa3e852\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T15:17:45.681Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Back in the corporate world, and Twitter has appointed the first woman to its board, Majorie Scardino - ex-boss of Financial Times owner Pearson.</strong></p> <p>She has also been given a \"restricted stock unit award\" covering 4,018 shares, currently worth $177,000.</p> <p>Not only has she joined the board, she's also joined the site.

The outcome is in line with our forecast.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the projections show HICP at an average 1.3% in 2015 (Newedge: 1.4%), which remains well below the ECB 2% preferred level. The profile for growth remains that of a very gradual recovery, which implies very modest underlying inflationary pressure in the medium term. Draghi confirmed that the cross check with the monetary developments confirm the picture of tame inflation pressures.</p> <p>Given today's updated staff projections, the ECB stable policy stance at this week's meeting would be fully justified. Indeed, near term deflation risks have somehow diminished in November (with the HICP running at 0.9%) and the HICP profile in the medium term is still upward sloping. Although inflation is expected to continue to undershoot the ECB's preferred level for two more years, the ECB might argue that HICP will be close to 2% at the end of the policy horizon.</p> <p>During the ECB press conference, Draghi makes some important points:</p> <p>1) The ECB didn't act on just 1 figure (HICP down to 0.7%) when it decided to cut rates but on the overall weak picture.</p> <p>2) Rate cut has been effective in keeping market under control. That said, no immediate effects on the economy are expected as the transmission mechanism is slow.</p> <p>3) Draghi keeps door open to other options (i.e negative rates, further LTROs) but he suggests that the ECB will not react to a short-term movement but it will continue to evaluate the all picture and assess the possible reactions functions.</p> <p>In a nutshell, ECB in a wait and see mode after the November cut. Draghi clearly says that the level of uncertainty is now lower than in 2011 and the ECB can afford to have a clearer assessment on what are the effects of their policy action.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T15:07:39.554Z\">at 3.07pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a08f75e4b0f5ad203213fd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T14:39:33.928Z\">2.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After 10 minutes more than usual of questioning (is that good or bad?) the ECB press conference comes to a close.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-52a08f14e4b0f5ad203213fc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T14:36:33.690Z\">2.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bloomberg: was anyone calling for a cut in rates?

Looking ahead, we expect the projections to show HICP at an average 1.4% in 2015, which would remain well below the ECB 2% preferred level. The profile for growth will remain that of a very gradual recovery, which implies very modest underlying inflationary pressure in the medium term.<br>In a nutshell, the ECB doesn't need to act now but we suspect that any undershooting of the current inflation path would be a trigger for further accommodation at any time. A stable inflation outlook at the current levels (or slightly higher) seems to be the pre-condition for no additional policy accommodation in the coming months. That said, the ECB will also look at the development of financial conditions. Should market rates increase sharply and/or the exchange rate appreciate further, the ECB might decide to act with further accommodation even if deflation risks don't increase.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SonyKapoor/statuses/408578273220653056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ECB&amp;src=hash\">#ECB</a> feels its hands are tied - It&#39;s open 2 QE but regrets there r no suitable markets to use &amp; the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23EIB&amp;src=hash\">#EIB</a> refused 2 play ball on SMEs</p>&mdash; Sony Kapoor (@SonyKapoor) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonyKapoor/statuses/408578273220653056\">December 5, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/alaidi/statuses/408578480389898240\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Who on earth was expecting an ECB rate cut. gonna leave the door open for rate cuts but if they dont go pass it, it&#39;s a poor bluff <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23forex&amp;src=hash\">#forex</a></p>&mdash; Ashraf Laidi (@alaidi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alaidi/statuses/408578480389898240\">December 5, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T12:56:22.236Z\">at 12.56pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a07609e4b0f5ad203213c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T12:48:31.291Z\">12.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here for completeness, is the full ECB statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.25%, 0.75% and 0.00% respectively.</p> <p>The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. CET today.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T12:49:34.581Z\">at 12.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a0713ae4b0acc591790d2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T12:45:41.936Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">ECB keeps rates unchanged</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The European Central Bank, which surprised markets with a rate cut last month, has kept rates unchanged after today's meeting.</p> <p>The ECB press conference will be <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/tvservices/webcast/html/webcast_131205.en.html\">streamed here</a> at 13.30 GMT.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T12:45:56.037Z\">at 12.45pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-52a06d40e4b0acc591790d24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-12-05T12:17:03.109Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here's some reaction to the Bank of England decision to keep rates and QE on hold, which came minutes after George Osborne announced an increased forecast for UK GDP:</strong></p> <p><strong>Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was never any doubt that the Bank of England would leave all aspects of monetary policy unchanged at its December MPC meeting and this duly proved to be the case.</p> <p>Indeed, the odds still favour interest rates staying at 0.50% all through 2014 despite the Bank of England\u2019s more optimistic view of the growth outlook and expectations that the unemployment rate will get down to 7.0% early in 2015, and possibly even in late 2014.</p> <p>While interest rates will probably start rising in 2015, this may still not happen until well into the year. For what it is worth, our current view is that the Bank of England will start to raise interest rates gradually from the third quarter of 2015.</p> <p>In contrast to the uncertainty over when interest rates could start to rise, it is blatantly obvious that any further Quantitative Easing is off the agenda barring a major relapse by the economy over the coming months. Significantly, there did not even appear to have been any discussion of the case for more QE at the November MPC meeting.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>James Knightley at ING:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This was universally expected given the forward guidance provided by the Bank. In any case the Bank is now going down the route of macro prudential policy by potentially directly intervening in the mortgage market, such as already seen in Canada and New Zealand where the central banks set lending standard boundaries. Such action gives the BoE greater control over the booming property market whilst giving parts of the economy that are lagging behind breathing space to try and catch-up.<br>The Bank of England\u2019s decision to adopt macro-prudential policy supports our view that the eventual peak in Bank Rate will be significantly lower than the previous cycle high of 5.75%. Nonetheless, with jobs market likely to strengthen through next year there is the clear potential for the unemployment rate to drop below 7%, the threshold the Bank of England has set before it will consider tightening monetary policy, to be breached in the second half of 2014. We therefore remain of the view that the first tentative interest rate rise will be implemented in early 2015.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Philip Shaw</strong>&#xa0;<strong>at Investec:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>&#xa0;There was no material accompanying announcement. Of course the focus in the UK today is the Chancellor\u2019s Autumn statement. However we expect some attention to be diverted back onto monetary policy next week thanks to data releases on industrial production, construction output, and the RICS survey of the housing market.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once again, the MPC did the right thing by holding interest rates and QE. However as the economy continues to recover, the forward guidance strategy faces challenges due to a change in expectations on interest rates. It is important to remember that most of the doubts around forward guidance are coming from City analysts, whereas most businesses have welcomed its use despite the difficulties of forecasting unemployment.</p> <p>The MPC can do more to improve its communication on forward guidance. Initially stating in August that the 7% threshold would be reached in 2016 was perhaps too cautious, but the most recent prediction that there is a 40% chance it could be reached by the end of 2014 is too ambitious. The MPC needs to continue its two-pronged approach with forward guidance on interest rates and a firm commitment to lowering inflation. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on improving the flow of finance to SMEs and growing businesses.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0ecbe12f-d8e8-4633-9a8d-33db1c413184\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/5/1386246055848/abd76f92-7ee5-4e16-b6d6-4d3b38aec08c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.

We see two possibilities. The first and, in our view, most likely scenario is that the Court\u2019s decision will force the main parties to reach a compromise to reform the electoral law, moving towards a majoritarian system or a mixed one (like the framework that was replaced by the current version of the electoral law). The second possibility is that parties fail once again to find an agreement: this would lead straight to fully proportional system, with potential negative implications in terms of governability.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-455c4224-2798-41bf-a4a4-94d3eedfa37b\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/5/1386242539008/9ae54977-7809-4f53-8fcd-6ab8bf7a5a98-460x277.jpeg\" alt=\"Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta welcomes the President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy in Rome yesterday.

It gave three reasons for the move:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>1) The evidence of a sustained rebalancing of the Spanish economy and improving medium-term economic prospects, which supports Moody's view that Spain's public finances are on a slowly improving trend. The external accounts continue to improve, the situation on the labour market has stabilized and the private non-financial sector continues to deleverage.

In the US, there are weekly jobless claims data, and GDP figures.</p> <p>The autumn statement is being covered in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/dec/05/george-osbornes-autumn-statement-live\"><strong>a live blog by my colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Graeme Wearden</strong>,</a> leaving me to concentrate on the central banks and the economic figures here.</p> <p>The Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates and its QE programme unchanged. Nor do analysts expect any change for the ECB, especially given its surprise rate cut last time round. But the press conference after the meeting will be scoured for clues on the bank's thinking about the outlook. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>T</strong>he&#xa0;<strong>latest economic data that markets had to digest yesterday</strong>&#xa0;starkly illustrated the problems facing the ECB when trying to set policy for an economic area that is diverging quite sharply.</p> <p>The perennial problem has always been&#xa0;<strong>how you set a policy that addresses economies that appear to be going in opposite directions,</strong>&#xa0;and it has been no better illustrated this week by the data coming from&#xa0;<strong>Germany which continues to surge ahead</strong>, contrasting sharply with that of&#xa0;<strong>France which appears to be heading back to recession</strong>, while occupying the middle ground of stagnation we have Italy.</p> <p>Given the sharp drop in inflationary pressures seen in the past six weeks the&#xa0;<strong>ECB caught the markets off-guard with the timing of last months rate cut,</strong>&#xa0;which on the face of it had all the hallmarks of a bank acting so that they could be seen to be doing something, rather than a bank that actually had the tools to resolve this&#xa0;<strong>economic riddle given to them by politicians to try and resolve</strong>.</p> <p>And therein lies the rub, under the rules of this dysfunctional monetary union&#xa0;<strong>the ECB\u2019s mandate prevents it from implementing the very fiscal stabilisers that have bought time for UK and US politicians</strong>, and yet we still see the same political stubbornness and reluctance to implement reforms and policy changes in France and Italy that are absolutely necessary for the monetary union to at least have a chance of working.</p> <p>Given that we only saw a rate cut last&#xa0;<strong>month it is highly unlikely that we will see another move on rates this month,</strong>&#xa0;and given the resistance from Germany to the last rate move, policymakers at the Bundesbank will be even more resistant after the positive economic data seen this week.

      "bodyText": "Time for a closing round up: \u2022 The Bank of England kept interest rates and QE steady \u2022 The ECB edged down its inflation forecasts and kept its powder dry after last month's surprise interest rate cut \u2022 US GDP grew by more than first thought in the third quarter.... \u2022 ...while weekly jobless claims were better than expected \u2022 Stock markets edged lower ahead of Friday's US non-farm payroll numbers as investors remained cautious about the Federal Reserve's stimulus programme \u2022 Greece hopes to return to the international capital markets next year \u2022 George Osborne announces raised UK GDP forecasts as part of the autumn statement \u2022 UK car sales accelerate in November And on that note it's time to close up for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we'll be back tomorrow when the most crucial item on the agenda looks likely to be the US non-farm payroll numbers. Until then, have a good evening. Over in Greece the finance ministry has announced that after almost four years being shut out of international capital markets the country will return to them next year. Helena Smith reports: Despite still lumbering under a mountain of debt Greece will return to markets in 2014, the deputy finance minister Christos Staikouras said today. In another sign of the immense fiscal headway the country has made, Staikouras predicted that Greece\u2019s prolonged recession \u2013 at almost seven years the longest in post war history \u2013 would also end next year. \u201cThere are strong signs that people\u2019s sacrifices have started to yield fruit,\u201d he told lawmakers as parliament debated the draft budget for 2014 \u2013 due to be voted by the 300-seat House on Saturday. A return to the markets would be the best evidence yet that the eurozone\u2019s weakest link is finally exiting its worst crisis in modern times. But on the ground, Greeks remains anything but convinced that things are getting better \u2013 or the nation has turned the corner \u2013 with many bracing for their toughest winter since the onset of the crisis in late 2009. Although Troika mission chiefs are set to return to Athens next week, according to officials at the finance ministry \u2013 after stalling talks because of differences over structural reforms \u2013 tensions with creditors remain unusually high with Greece digging in its heels over demands that the government makes way for more belt-tightening measures, including repossession of homes. With the Bank of England and European Central Bank both keeping interest rates on hold, and the ECB playing a wait and see game after last month's surprise cut, markets have drifted lower. The main focus remains on the US Federal Reserve, and when it might start trimming its $85bn a month bond buying programme. Better than expected jobless and GDP figures added to the raft of positive news which has prompted talk that the Fed may move more quickly than expected. Tomorrow's US non-farm payroll numbers will be scrutinised for further clues. Meanwhile, here are the scores on the doors from today: \u2022 The FTSE 100 has finished 11.64 points or 0.18% lower at 6498.33 \u2022 Germany's Dax is down 0.61% at 9084.95 \u2022 France's Cac has closed 1.17% lower at 4099.91 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB is 1.75% down at 17,993.12 \u2022 Spain's Ibex is off 1.56% at 9392.1 \u2022 The Athens market has fallen 1.77% to 1190.30 \u2022 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently off 19.97 points or 0.12% ECB president Mario Draghi's comments about increasing liquidity but making sure banks did not just use it to buy government bonds, was the key point of the ECB's press conference, according to Marco Valli at UniCredit Research: TheECB kept all its interest rates unchanged, in line with our and the consensus forecast. The most important news was on liquidity, as Draghi revealed that the ECB is studying a new framework where funding to banks is made conditional to lending activity. The updated macroeconomic projections were largely in line with our expectations, indicating ongoing moderate economic recovery amid low inflation. In the Q&amp;A session, Draghi revealed that the ECB is studying a new framework to provide liquidity to banks and repair the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. This new tool, which will be deployed if needed, will differ from the three year LTROs, on the basis of the current much more favorable market environment and the acknowledgement that most of the three year liquidity pumped into the system between the end of 2011 and early 2012 did not reach the real economy, but was rather used to purchase government bonds (according to Draghi, this also contributed to delaying the restructuring of the banking sector). This is the first time that Draghi comes out with an explicit message on such an important feature of a potential new liquidity-providing operation, and what we learned today is very much in line with our long-held view on this topic. Although Draghi was careful to state that this is only one of the possible tools the ECB can deploy, we have little doubt that in the next few months the need for additional liquidity support will arise. We still think that this will happen in the first quarter of 2014, shortly after the US Federal Reserve announces its intention to start tapering. This means that the ECB still has some time to fine-tune the technical details. As Draghi openly acknowledged today, translating the idea into practice is the most difficult part of the job. Bill Gross, founder of investment management group Pimco. has been talking about markets and the Federal Reserve's next step on its economic stimulus programme: So what will the ECB do next? Following today's statement and press conference, Dr Howard Archer at IHG Global Insight said: We expect the ECB will take further action before long, most likely in the form of another Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) especially given latest data showing a further and deeper fall in bank lending to businesses in October. It seems highly possible that any future LTRO would be tailored specifically towards bank lending. Mr. Draghi indicated that if there was another LTRO, the ECB would want to make sure that it was not hoarded by banks or used to buy government bonds which largely happened with the two previous LTRO\u2019s. It is possible that the ECB will eventually go down the negative deposit interest rate route but we suspect they would prefer not to and will only do so if inflation falls appreciably further. We also suspect Quantitative Easing will prove to be too controversial a policy within the Governing Council to get adopted. Meanwhile, we expect the ECB to keep its refinancing rate at 0.25% through to 2015, although it is not inconceivable that it could trim it to 0.1% or even 0.0%. As ECB boss Mario Draghi promised earlier, the central bank has released details of its economic projections (PDF). There's even a fan-chart as beloved of the Bank of England's inflation report: And a comparison of forecasts from various sources: Back in the corporate world, and Twitter has appointed the first woman to its board, Majorie Scardino - ex-boss of Financial Times owner Pearson. She has also been given a \"restricted stock unit award\" covering 4,018 shares, currently worth $177,000. Not only has she joined the board, she's also joined the site. Here for posterity is her first and so far only tweet, a reply to Twitter's welcome message: More on Draghi: Here's more detail on the US GDP figures, courtesy of AP: The US economy grew at a 3.6% annual rate from July through September, the fastest since early 2012. But nearly half the growth came from a buildup in business stockpiles, a trend that could reverse in the current quarter and hold back growth. The Commerce Department's second estimate of third-quarter growth released Thursday was sharply higher than the initial 2.8% rate reported last month. And it was well above the 2.5% growth rate for the April-June quarter. Almost the entire third-quarter revision came from a big jump in stockpiles. Consumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, was the weakest in nearly four years. The full story is here: US economy grew 3.6% in third quarter at fastest rate since 2012 Commenting on the ECB statement and Draghi press conference, Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said it is clear the ECB is in no hurry for further action after November's surprise rate cut: The December staff projections show a slight downward revision for the 2014 inflation forecast (0.2% to 1.1%) on the back of lower oil prices and a carry-over effects due to the low inflation rate at the end of 2013. The outcome is in line with our forecast. Looking ahead, the projections show HICP at an average 1.3% in 2015 (Newedge: 1.4%), which remains well below the ECB 2% preferred level. The profile for growth remains that of a very gradual recovery, which implies very modest underlying inflationary pressure in the medium term. Draghi confirmed that the cross check with the monetary developments confirm the picture of tame inflation pressures. Given today's updated staff projections, the ECB stable policy stance at this week's meeting would be fully justified. Indeed, near term deflation risks have somehow diminished in November (with the HICP running at 0.9%) and the HICP profile in the medium term is still upward sloping. Although inflation is expected to continue to undershoot the ECB's preferred level for two more years, the ECB might argue that HICP will be close to 2% at the end of the policy horizon. During the ECB press conference, Draghi makes some important points: 1) The ECB didn't act on just 1 figure (HICP down to 0.7%) when it decided to cut rates but on the overall weak picture. 2) Rate cut has been effective in keeping market under control. That said, no immediate effects on the economy are expected as the transmission mechanism is slow. 3) Draghi keeps door open to other options (i.e negative rates, further LTROs) but he suggests that the ECB will not react to a short-term movement but it will continue to evaluate the all picture and assess the possible reactions functions. In a nutshell, ECB in a wait and see mode after the November cut. Draghi clearly says that the level of uncertainty is now lower than in 2011 and the ECB can afford to have a clearer assessment on what are the effects of their policy action. After 10 minutes more than usual of questioning (is that good or bad?) the ECB press conference comes to a close. Bloomberg: was anyone calling for a cut in rates? Are you considering smaller cuts? Draghi said there was no call to cut rates. November's cut had desired outcome, and no sense in having another discussion today. We have an array of instruments (don't want to use military term artillery!) New York Times says US GDP could mean tapering coming - what are consequences for eurozone? Draghi says, on consequences there have been limited spill overs. In May when it looked as if tapering could be happening sooner, were not extensive consequences on euro markets, More significant for emerging markets. That episode may have seen a repricing of assets which would avoid consequences. How concerned is ECB by financial rates rigging scandal? Draghi says its a matter for European Commission, not us, in terms of fines etc. In terms of what it does to reference rate, it is up to Commission to come up with reference rate which stands after these issues. We are working with Commission but not in driving seat. A question on the range of instruments available, asking whether asset purchases would only focus on banking assets. Draghi repeats there is no decision on any of these instruments, but ECB is ready and able to act. Financial Times asks about inflation expectations, and how appropriate is it to place such faith in these expectations given problems in Japan with targets. Draghi says situation in euro area is different to Japan. We have taken decisive monetary policy measures at a very early stage, at a time when inflation was way higher than now. That did not happen in Japan. In Japan, balance sheets of banking sector and private sector had to be deleveraged, and this process lagged a few years. This is already taking place here with the asset quality review. The situation with balance sheets is not comparable with Japan. Countries in the euro area have taken measures to address structural problems, and situation is better than two years ago. Inflation expectations in euro area and corresponding rates, in Japan these were de-anchored which is not the case here. A question on the prospect of another LTRO, and how to ensure it would feed through to the economy. Draghi says work has been done on this, so if the time comes we will be ready. German journalist (sorry didnt catch name) asks about divergence of opinion on council. Asks about options for using extreme measures Draghi says rarely have a vote, but did last time. The discussion in November was whether to cut rates now or later, and some who disagreed later said it was justified. (NB the Bundesbank for one was not keen on cutting). On other instruments, it is a hard question to decide which to use (under which circumstances). Economico from Portugal asks what conditions could see the country exiting bailout programme. Draghi says progress in Portugal has been significant. Prospects for a return to market financing have improved. Initial weaknesses were very serious, but progress has been made. Les Echo asks about negative deposit rates. Was there a discussion about cutting rates? On exchange rates, in February these were mentioned as downside risks. Is it not a risk now? Draghi says again there was a brief discussion on cutting rates. On exchange rates, the fact there is no statement there today does not mean ECB is not watching exchange rates. Wall Street Journal goes back to the policy options, and what they are and the discussions which were had. Also ask about the weak growth projections. Draghi says no specific instruments were identified by the discussion. Level of preparedness is high on all of them. Don't need any further analysis. Question is, would use of these instruments be justified by medium term outlook. Markets have responded strongly to forward guidance. But will still closely monitor any developments and are fully aware of downside risks of extended period of low inflation. On the growth, he says the fundamentals of euro are are strong. Major policy mistakes of previous times are being corrected, the structural imbalances had to be reformed. Low growth is outcome of economies that need to have structural reform. Each country has own specific list of work it has to do. Neither growth nor equity can be expected from endless debt creation. So have to be careful, the economies have to structually prepared for stimulus to have an effect. CNBC asks about new LTROs [Long-Term Refinancing Operations] or something like the Bank of England's funding for lending scheme. Draghi says forward guidance is there, have not identified one specific instrument. They had a brief discussion about negative interest rates. On LTRO, when this was introduced level of uncertainty was high, which justified it. LTRO was very successful and avoided credit contractions at time due to lack of funding. Now the level of uncertainty is lower. Plus, the banks used this facility to buy government bonds and not much found its way through to the economy. If do another operation like LTRO, want to make it sure it goes to the economy and not subsidising banking system. Market Week asks for more news on any release of the minutes. Secondly, no one has mentioned option of foreign exchange intervention, would ECB use it. Draghi says minutes issue is complicated, with issues including should people be named as to what they say. They are still working on it. On exchange rates, he says they are not a policy target but they are important for price stability and growth. Forex intervention is not contemplated by current G20 policies. Reuters (speaking as he says from the cheap seats at the back) asks about the inflation targets, whether there is enough of a buffer against deflation and the fact that the closest to the 2% target is 1.3%. Draghi starts by saying its decision to cut rates in November is justified, and forward guidance is working. All in all, we are seeing positive developments after November decision. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in medium term. HIPC path is what it is , but inflation excluding food and energy drifts slightly higher. It would be wrong to think we decide monetary policy on one figure, inflation, but would also be wrong to say effect of monetary policy is instantaneous. The length of time it takes depends on a number of factors, including what is the state of bank and private sector balance sheets. Draghi sums up: The economic analysis indicates that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the European Commission\u2019s assessment of the 2014 draft budgetary plans which were submitted in October for the first time under the \u201ctwo-pack\u201d regulations. This new surveillance exercise needs to be fully effective. In order to put high public debt ratios on a downward path, governments should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and sustain fiscal adjustment over the medium term. In particular, consolidation measures should be growth-friendly and have a medium-term perspective, so as both to improve public services and minimise the distortionary effects of taxation. At the same time, there is a need to push ahead with product and labour market reforms, in order to improve competitiveness, raise potential growth, generate employment opportunities and foster the adaptability of our economies. Now for questions. Draghi's introductory remarks are now available here. Draghi says (as many had expected) more details of the ECB's forecasts will be released, but says nothing about releasing full minutes. Both the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve routinely release minutes of their monthly meetings, but the ECB has not done so in the past. On inflation the bank expects HIPC to be 1.4% in 2013 (down 1 percentage point on previous forecasts). For 2014 it expects a figure of 1.1% (down 0.2 percentage points) and 1.3% for 2015. Draghi says the ECB will continue all available instruments. Third quarter GDP rose 0.1% quarter on quarter, with a small postive growth rate expected in the fourth quarter. The ECB's forecast for GDP in 2013 is unchanged at -0.4%. It has raised the forecast by 0.1 percentage point to a 1.1% rise in 2014. It expects a 1.5% rise in 2015, but warns risks are on the downside. Draghi is here, slightly late. He begins by wishing everyone a merry Christmas, to chuckles. He says price pressures will remain subdued in medium term, and inflation expectations are firmly anchored in line with the 2% target. A prolonged period of low inflation is expected to be followed by rates close to 2% later on. The council continues to expect key interest rate to be at this or lower level for extended time. Meanwhile US jobless claims fell unexpectedly to 23,000 to 298,000 last week. Analysts had expected a rise to 325,000. The US economy grew faster than first forecast in the third quarter. GDP grew by 3.6%, up from the 2.6% previously reported. This is the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2012. The ECB press conference is about to start. A leading US central banker has said it is reasonable for investors to expect the Fed to wind down its stimulus programme over the next year. Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart said in a speech in Miami that when the Fed begins trimming its $85bn a month bond buying programme - a key support for markets over recent months - it should commit to a schedule for ending it completely. It should consider taking the first steps towards tapering \"in the coming meetings\" given the overall positive economic data recently. That seems to include this month's meeting, even though most observers are not expecting any move until the new year. Lockhart would not say whether he supported tapering, saying he would be \"looking for positive evidence of momentum as well as the absence or retreat of factors that could restrain or even torpedo progress.\" Investors are poring over every piece of US data, and central bank comment, for clues as to when tapering might begin. Ahead of the ECB press conference, some reaction to the central bank's statement. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: We expect a dovish tone [at the meeting] and Draghi is expected to leave door open to further accommodation if needed, with the use of any available tool. We anticipate the December staff projections to show a slight downward revision for the 2014 inflation forecast (about 0.2% to 1.1%) on the back of lower oil prices and a carry-over effects due to the low inflation rate at the end of 2013. Looking ahead, we expect the projections to show HICP at an average 1.4% in 2015, which would remain well below the ECB 2% preferred level. The profile for growth will remain that of a very gradual recovery, which implies very modest underlying inflationary pressure in the medium term. In a nutshell, the ECB doesn't need to act now but we suspect that any undershooting of the current inflation path would be a trigger for further accommodation at any time. A stable inflation outlook at the current levels (or slightly higher) seems to be the pre-condition for no additional policy accommodation in the coming months. That said, the ECB will also look at the development of financial conditions. Should market rates increase sharply and/or the exchange rate appreciate further, the ECB might decide to act with further accommodation even if deflation risks don't increase. Here for completeness, is the full ECB statement: At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.25%, 0.75% and 0.00% respectively. The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 2.30 p.m. CET today. The European Central Bank, which surprised markets with a rate cut last month, has kept rates unchanged after today's meeting. The ECB press conference will be streamed here at 13.30 GMT. Here's some reaction to the Bank of England decision to keep rates and QE on hold, which came minutes after George Osborne announced an increased forecast for UK GDP: Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: There was never any doubt that the Bank of England would leave all aspects of monetary policy unchanged at its December MPC meeting and this duly proved to be the case. Indeed, the odds still favour interest rates staying at 0.50% all through 2014 despite the Bank of England\u2019s more optimistic view of the growth outlook and expectations that the unemployment rate will get down to 7.0% early in 2015, and possibly even in late 2014. While interest rates will probably start rising in 2015, this may still not happen until well into the year. For what it is worth, our current view is that the Bank of England will start to raise interest rates gradually from the third quarter of 2015. In contrast to the uncertainty over when interest rates could start to rise, it is blatantly obvious that any further Quantitative Easing is off the agenda barring a major relapse by the economy over the coming months. Significantly, there did not even appear to have been any discussion of the case for more QE at the November MPC meeting. James Knightley at ING: This was universally expected given the forward guidance provided by the Bank. In any case the Bank is now going down the route of macro prudential policy by potentially directly intervening in the mortgage market, such as already seen in Canada and New Zealand where the central banks set lending standard boundaries. Such action gives the BoE greater control over the booming property market whilst giving parts of the economy that are lagging behind breathing space to try and catch-up. The Bank of England\u2019s decision to adopt macro-prudential policy supports our view that the eventual peak in Bank Rate will be significantly lower than the previous cycle high of 5.75%. Nonetheless, with jobs market likely to strengthen through next year there is the clear potential for the unemployment rate to drop below 7%, the threshold the Bank of England has set before it will consider tightening monetary policy, to be breached in the second half of 2014. We therefore remain of the view that the first tentative interest rate rise will be implemented in early 2015. Philip Shaw at Investec: There was no material accompanying announcement. Of course the focus in the UK today is the Chancellor\u2019s Autumn statement. However we expect some attention to be diverted back onto monetary policy next week thanks to data releases on industrial production, construction output, and the RICS survey of the housing market. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce: Once again, the MPC did the right thing by holding interest rates and QE. However as the economy continues to recover, the forward guidance strategy faces challenges due to a change in expectations on interest rates. It is important to remember that most of the doubts around forward guidance are coming from City analysts, whereas most businesses have welcomed its use despite the difficulties of forecasting unemployment. The MPC can do more to improve its communication on forward guidance. Initially stating in August that the 7% threshold would be reached in 2016 was perhaps too cautious, but the most recent prediction that there is a 40% chance it could be reached by the end of 2014 is too ambitious. The MPC needs to continue its two-pronged approach with forward guidance on interest rates and a firm commitment to lowering inflation. In addition, more emphasis should be placed on improving the flow of finance to SMEs and growing businesses. The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.50% and its asset purchase programme at \u00a3375bn, as expected. So no upstaging of George Osborne then, who continues to unveil his Autumn statement In Cyprus: And ahead of the European Central Bank meeting, here's one of the key points to watch: Here's the first central bank decision of the day: the Norges Bank, as widely expected, left its deposit rate unchanged at 1.50%. In his statement George Osborne is quoting new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The UK economy is now expected to grow by 1.4% this year, well up on the 0.6% predicted in March's Budget. For the Euro area, the OBR expects GDP to shrink by 0.4% in 2013. UK chancellor George Osborne has begun his Autumn statement. You can follow all the developments in our live blog here and get rolling reaction separately here. Italy's top court yesterday ruled the current electoral law was unconstitutional, putting pressure on the country's political parties to pass a reform of the system. As Reuters reported: The constitutional court cited two aspects of the system that flouted the constitution, namely a winners' bonus of seats awarded to the largest coalition without a minimum threshold, and the fact that it does not allow voters to pick an individual candidate. Economists Chiara Corsa and Dr. Loredana Federic at UniCredit Research looked at the implications: First of all, we highlight that the Court\u2019s decision has no impact on the current parliament as it applies only to future elections. Secondly, the Court\u2019s decision implies that the majority premium no longer exists: in case of new elections and absent any legislation change, the new system would be fully proportional. Third, the Court\u2019s decision forces the parliament to legislate on the preferences issue \u2013 there are no alternatives. It is now up to the parliament to decide whether and how to reform the electoral law amending the current version of the majority premium. We see two possibilities. The first and, in our view, most likely scenario is that the Court\u2019s decision will force the main parties to reach a compromise to reform the electoral law, moving towards a majoritarian system or a mixed one (like the framework that was replaced by the current version of the electoral law). The second possibility is that parties fail once again to find an agreement: this would lead straight to fully proportional system, with potential negative implications in terms of governability. Ireland is the 'best country in the world' to do business, according to Forbes. Henry McDonald in Dublin writes: The Republic moved up this year from sixth most pro-business state to the top which the country's Employment Minister Richard Bruton said today was \"a testament to the hard work and innovation of our businesses and workers.\" The magazine's rankings are based on 11 different factors ranging from property rights, innovation, taxes, technology, corruption, freedoms, investor protection and stock market performance. The Irish are now ahead of countries which have been relatively immune from the global recession such as New Zealand, Hong Kong, Denmark and Sweden. The highly educated workforce and the Republic's low 12.5% corporation tax rate are also cited as factors in Forbes as to why Ireland is the best location for business. Ireland's Industrial Development Authority - the body that tries to woo foreign direct investment into the Republic - also welcomed Forbes' global business assessment. IDA's Chief Executive Barry O\u2019Leary said: \"This Forbes ranking will reach senior business people across the world, making them aware of all the advantages available to those that locate businesses here.\" \"Country rankings like this are used by companies across the world when they make initial decisions to investigate the possibility of locating their businesses internationally.\" Despite all the talk of the US Federal Reserve potentially trimming its $85bn a month bond buying programme, the dollar does not seem to be benefiting, unlike US bond yields. Kathleen Brooks at Forex.com said: As prospects of Fed tapering gather pace it appears that foreign exchange traders have not got the memo. 10-year Treasury yields rose to their highest level since September on Wednesday, yet the dollar index remains in the doldrums. While 10-year Treasury yields were buoyed on Thursday by a strong ADP labour market report and better data on the housing market, the foreign exchange market seemed focused on the weaker than expected ISM non-manufacturing survey for November. So which asset class is correct? That is impossible to answer, but usually the dollar and Treasury yields tend to move in the same direction. For example, they peaked at the same time in the first week of September, and they both reached recent lows on the 25 October. Thus, periods of divergence tend to be rectified. We think the dollar could play catch up with yields, especially if we get a strong non-farm payroll reading tomorrow (200,000 plus), which could increase the chances of a January taper from the Fed. From a technical perspective, we have seen the dollar claw back some recent losses this morning. A deeper dollar recovery may be dependent on a few factors over the next 24 hours: 1. Dovish commentary from ECB President Draghi. 2. Strong domestic data: the market expects the US to revise upwards its second GDP reading for the third quarter to 3.1% from 2.8%, we will also be watching initial jobless claims. If the fundamental data in the US is strong then we could see a deeper recovery in the dollar. Spain has sold \u20ac3.53bn of bonds in its penultimate auction of the year, at yields broadly unchanged from recent sales and has now reached its 2013 target. It sold \u20ac1.28bn worth of April 2017 bonds at an average yield of 2.182%. The yield at November's auction was 2.101%. The bond was 3.6 times subscribed, up from 2.5 times last month. It also raised \u20ac2.25bn with an October 2018 bond with a 2.722% yield, compared to 2.871% last month. Newedge Strategy said: The relative spread widening versus Italy (and also core EMU countries) supported demand at today's auction. Economists at RBC have issued a quick rundown on the three central bank meetings today (we neglected to mention Norges Bank earlier): For the ECB, the macro news since the previous policy meeting is fairly limited and, therefore, we see relatively little chance that there will be a consensus for any further easing at this stage. That said, we expect President Draghi to reiterate that there are still many options open, any combination of which could be taken if there is material downside news in the months ahead. For the Bank of England, with the MPC continuing in forward guidance mode, there is little risk of anything exciting happening today, and we see no impetus for policy change. For the Norges Bank, we expect that it will leave its key policy rate unchanged at 1.50%. We look for the accompanying Monetary Policy Report to show a modest downward revision to the baseline profile for policy rates, indicating that a rate cut still remains possible in the near term (particularly if there are further signs of a weakening in the housing market). On the corporate front, shares in AZ Electronic Materials - which makes specialty chemicals used in the manufacture of Apple's iPad - have soared more than 50%. The company has agreed a \u00a31.57bn bid from German drugs and chemicals group Merck. Howard Archer, chief European and UK economist at IHG Global Insight welcomed the UK car sales but warned consumers were still being squeezed. He said: Car manufacturers are justifiably very happy with the way sales have gone in the UK in 2013 and they will be encouraged by the markedly improved UK economic environment and the substantial overall strengthening in consumer and business confidence. Even so, car manufacturers will be very aware that it is not all plain driving ahead with consumers\u2019 purchasing power squeezed by inflation persistently running markedly higher than earnings growth while businesses generally remain keen to contain costs. The motor industry will be hoping that the recent improvement in UK economic activity is sustained and extended, and that this underpins consumer and business confidence, and their willingness to splash out on new cars. Car makers have already sold more vehicles in the UK so far this year than in the whole of 2012, with one month to go. A total of 159,581 new cars were registered in November, up 7% on the same month last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). So far this year, some 2,111,819 cars have been sold, well above the total of 2.04m for 2012. The total for this year is expected to reach around 2.25m, which would make this the best year for new registrations since 2007, when sales reached 2.4 million. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said [This is] a tremendous success for the industry on the back of buoyant consumer confidence and innovative new products. With the UK economy looking increasingly positive, we can expect strong underlying demand for new cars to continue into 2014, with volumes set to match or surpass those seen this year. Alternatively-fuelled vehicle sales rose 16.4% this year but still make up just 1.4% of the new-car market. The best selling models in November were: 1. Ford Fiesta 2. Ford Focus 3. Vauxhall Astra 4. Vauxhall Corsa 5. Volkswagen Golf 6. Vauxhall Insignia 7. Nissan Qashqai 8. Fiat 500 9. BMW 3 Series 10. Nissan Juke Here's an early look at the markets: Good news for Spain last night, as Moody's raised its outlook for the country's government bonds. It kep its rating at Baa3 but moved the outlook to stable from negative. It gave three reasons for the move: 1) The evidence of a sustained rebalancing of the Spanish economy and improving medium-term economic prospects, which supports Moody's view that Spain's public finances are on a slowly improving trend. The external accounts continue to improve, the situation on the labour market has stabilized and the private non-financial sector continues to deleverage. Moody's expects moderate but positive growth from 2014 onward. 2) The material decrease in market access risks for the Spanish sovereign and the lower risk of contagion from negative events elsewhere in the euro area than at the time of Moody's last rating action in October 2012. This is reflected in the Spanish Treasury's relative ease in securing sizeable amounts of market funding at significantly lower interest rates than in 2012. 3) The significant reduction in contingent liabilities for the sovereign emanating from the Spanish banking sector over the past year. Following several rounds of capital injections and the transfer of real-estate assets to the so-called bad bank Sareb, Moody's now believes that any further potential recapitalization needs of the Spanish banking system would be limited in size and would be unlikely to derail the slowly improving trend in the country's public finances. The full announcement is here: Moody's changes outlook on Spain's Baa3 government bond rating to stable from negative Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across the financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. In another busy day, the main focus will be on the UK's autumn statement, due to be unveiled by chancellor George Osborne at 11.15 GMT, as well as the latest meetings of the Bank of England and European Central Bank. In the US, there are weekly jobless claims data, and GDP figures. The autumn statement is being covered in a live blog by my colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Graeme Wearden, leaving me to concentrate on the central banks and the economic figures here. The Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates and its QE programme unchanged. Nor do analysts expect any change for the ECB, especially given its surprise rate cut last time round. But the press conference after the meeting will be scoured for clues on the bank's thinking about the outlook. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The latest economic data that markets had to digest yesterday starkly illustrated the problems facing the ECB when trying to set policy for an economic area that is diverging quite sharply. The perennial problem has always been how you set a policy that addresses economies that appear to be going in opposite directions, and it has been no better illustrated this week by the data coming from Germany which continues to surge ahead, contrasting sharply with that of France which appears to be heading back to recession, while occupying the middle ground of stagnation we have Italy. Given the sharp drop in inflationary pressures seen in the past six weeks the ECB caught the markets off-guard with the timing of last months rate cut, which on the face of it had all the hallmarks of a bank acting so that they could be seen to be doing something, rather than a bank that actually had the tools to resolve this economic riddle given to them by politicians to try and resolve. And therein lies the rub, under the rules of this dysfunctional monetary union the ECB\u2019s mandate prevents it from implementing the very fiscal stabilisers that have bought time for UK and US politicians, and yet we still see the same political stubbornness and reluctance to implement reforms and policy changes in France and Italy that are absolutely necessary for the monetary union to at least have a chance of working. Given that we only saw a rate cut last month it is highly unlikely that we will see another move on rates this month, and given the resistance from Germany to the last rate move, policymakers at the Bundesbank will be even more resistant after the positive economic data seen this week. Under normal circumstances, excluding all else, rates in Germany would probably need to be nudged higher, not lower. It will be at the press conference where we will see what the ECB\u2019s thoughts are on inflation and growth forecasts and whether we will see any changes to them in 2014, as well as the first glimpses of ECB thinking about the prospects for 2015. Meanwhile investors are still nervous about the prospect of the US Federal Reserve starting to trim its $85bn a month bond buying programme, which has been a key support for the markets. Recent US data has been mixed, but good enough to prompt fears the Fed could \"taper\" its buying sooner than expected. Today jobless claims - expected to rise from 316,000 to 328,000 - and GDP could give further clues, but Friday's non-farm payroll numbers could be the key piece of data.",

They want a solid commitment to reform, not another vague pledge.\"</p> <p>The British Beer &amp; Pub Association said the rate discount was \"very good news\" for three-in-four pubs, - roughly 38,000 - which have a rateable value of less than \u00a350,000.</p> <p>However, Simon Tivey of PriceWaterHouseCoopers, warned that measures to fill vacant premises could encourage \"a merry go round of rate relief relocations\", as businesses swap shops to get the tax discount.

      "bodyText": "\"Help for the high street\" was one of the key phrases of the the autumn statement as the chancellor announced a \u00a31,000 discount on business rates to help small shopkeepers and pubs. George Osborne said that owners of small shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants epitomised the hard-working values the government supports and small businesses with properties worth up to \u00a350,000 will now be entitled to the rates discount . Traders moving into a vacant property will also be entitled to a 50% discount on rates, under a \"re-occupation\" relief scheme, while all firms will be entitled to pay their rates in 12 monthly installments. As widely expected, Osborne also pledged to limit rises in business rates to 2% and extended the small business rate relief scheme for one year beyond 2014. Rates had been due to go up in line with September's retail price index of 3.2%, which would have added \u00a3900m to business owners' tax bills. Business groups, who have lobbied fiercely for a rates freeze, welcomed the cap but voiced disappointment that the government had ignored calls for a root-and-branch review of business rates. The cap, costing the Treasury \u00a3270m next year, will be seen as an attempt to wrest control of the issue from Labour, after Ed Miliband pledged to freeze rates for business owners with properties worth less than \u00a350,000. \"We lead, the govt follows,\" tweeted Labour's shadow business minister Chuka Umunna. Both parties are vying to be seen as the small shopkeeper's friend ahead of the UK's first-ever Small Business Saturday, a US-imported idea to help small retailers promote their wares this weekend. \"The measures announced to curb business rate increases are positive, but not strong enough to boost companies' cash flow and investment,\" said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce. The BCC has described the rates system as \"perverse\" and Kern added: \"While we welcome the intention to consult on longer-term reform, businesses have heard this all before. They want a solid commitment to reform, not another vague pledge.\" The British Beer &amp; Pub Association said the rate discount was \"very good news\" for three-in-four pubs, - roughly 38,000 - which have a rateable value of less than \u00a350,000. However, Simon Tivey of PriceWaterHouseCoopers, warned that measures to fill vacant premises could encourage \"a merry go round of rate relief relocations\", as businesses swap shops to get the tax discount. The plan \"has the potential to be unfair to existing businesses who may struggle to pay full rates\" he said. Veteran retail boss Bill Grimsey said the cap was \"too little too late for about 20,000 retailers\" already struggling with high rates, which were set before the recession took hold. \"Yes he has put a cap of 2%, but don't lose sight of the fact that the freeze is at a 2008 level based on 2008 measures and that's the thing that is wrong about this.\" Grimsey, who published a review on the future of the high street in September, accused the government of London bias by ignoring the plight of thousands of retailers in the north of England paying rates at a high level. \"In Rochdale, rents have fallen by 42% but rates are still based on 2008 valuation, whereas in Bond Street, where rents have risen astronomically \u2026 they are not paying as much as they should be. And that is typical of this government, which favours big business, doesn't favour small business they way it says it does.\" Osborne's help for the high street was, he said, \"a bit like a box of chocolates, there are some nice flavours and some nasty ones\". Business groups also gave mixed reviews to the government's plan to scrap employers' national insurance payments for under 21s, a move affecting 1.5m young people that is likely to boost supermarkets and larger retailers. Helen Dickinson, director general of the British Retail Consortium, said: \"40% of all jobs for those under 20 are in retail, and this will help retailers provide secure career opportunities for young people.\" But experts warned the tax cut could disadvantage job-seekers in their early 20s. \"Students leaving university at 21 may find things a little tougher, as employees look to save on staff costs,\" said Toby Ryland, a partner at accountancy firm HW Fisher.

      "bodyText": "Blockbuster is likely to disappear from the British high street with the loss of more than 1,200 jobs, after administrators failed to find a buyer for the DVD and games rental chain. A further 62 stores will close from Friday, with 427 job losses, following a spate of closures since the chain went into administration in October for the second time this year. Administrators at Moorfields Corporate Recovery said they may be forced to close the remaining 91 stores employing 808 staff because they had not received \"any acceptable offers\" to buy the business. Simon Thomas, a partner at Moorfields, said business rates were \"a significant burden\" for large and small retailers on the high street. \"Having recently been appointed as administrators of Blockbuster we understand the impact that business rates can have on retail firms, even the size and scale of Blockbuster,\" he said. The chancellor in his autumn statement announced that he would cap next year's business rate rise at 2%, following lobbying from business groups against a projected 3.2%. But he did not bring forward a revaluation, which remains scheduled for 2017. Speaking before the announcement, Thomas said the 2% cap would not have helped Blockbuster. \"At 2% Blockbuster would have faced an increase of \u00a375,000 on an already sizeable \u00a33.8m, a figure which highlights the significant hurdles facing retailers and pushing many over the edge,\" he said. He also warned that the four-year wait until rates are reviewed in 2017 would be \"too much for the sector to bear\". \"Retail space is not as desirable as it once was and we need to take urgent action. We are not blind to the fact, however, that this would need to be paid for but are confident that by stimulating retail activity across the country, the exchequer should increase the direct and indirect tax take.\" Patrick O'Brien at Verdict Retail said: \"It is ridiculous to suggest that a change in rates could have possibly saved them from their fate.\" He added that it looked \"unlikely\" Blockbuster would find a buyer to revive the brand or take on its stores, with many of the best locations already \"cherry-picked\" in previous sales. At the start of the year Blockbuster had 528 stores employing 4,190 staff. Retail analysts have suggested Blockbuster's problems ran deep, with the chain overtaken by rivals such as Netflix and LoveFilm that allow consumers to rent films over the internet, as well as supermarkets offering cut-price DVDs. Neil Saunders at retail consultancy Conlumino recently said reviving Blockbuster was \"as logical as trying to open a chain of blacksmiths\". If no last-minute buyer steps forward, it will be high street switch-off for a brand that arrived in Britain in 1989, taking over Ritz videos and expanding rapidly under the slogan \"wow, what a difference\". Blockbuster's woes are mirrored in its US home market, where 300 Blockbusters will be gone by January, leaving only 50 franchised stores remaining. The store is only one of several high street brands to struggle in the face of internet competition, with music retailer HMV calling in the administrators, and only one in six Jessops camera shops rescued by Dragons' Den star Peter Jones after the company's collapse. Blockbuster has fallen into administration twice this year, but trade remained lacklustre after its first rescue by private equity group Gordon Brothers Europe in March. In October, the new owners admitted that its turnaround strategy had not worked. The next round of closures, affecting outlets across the country, gets under way tomorrow and continues through the weekend, with stock likely to be sold at discounts of 70%.",

Unemployment in Spain has fallen in recent months but there are still 4.8 million people out of work. The country's finance minister Luis de Guindos said this week people were underestimating the \"intensity\" of the country's recovery. He was speaking as official figures showed the number of people registered as unemployed in Spain fell by 2,475 in November, the first time the rate has dropped during the month since the current system was introduced in 1997. The minister attributed the drop to new jobs in construction and industry. \"There's still a long way to go,\" he told reporters, adding that \"additional measures\" were necessary. The events are telling of the different sides of the Spanish economy as it struggles to pull itself out of the economic crisis.

Other kinds of semen The UK exports bovine semen to countries including France, Kenya, Indonesia and Albania. Britain also exports dog semen and horse semen, and imports red-deer semen. Empty boxes Rising paper prices have created a lucrative market for recycled cardboard, especially in China. Basically, when China ships a new TV to the UK, we sell them back the box it came in, which they use to make a new box. It's green, efficient and rather canny, but it's a little embarrassing that even our exported empty boxes are being imported back, only full. Bendy buses The much-maligned bendy bus was removed from London's streets at the end of 2011, but the manufacturer, Arrive, sold a whole fleet to Malta, where they proved just as unpopular. Service was suspended in the summer after three of the buses caught fire. Midsomer Murders The Oxfordshire-set murder mystery series has proved popular in the US, Canada and Australia. It's also the most watched imported TV show in Denmark, where it has a 40% of the audience share. DI Barnaby even travelled to the home of The Killing to film a special 100th episode. Piers Morgan Former Mirror editor and professional irritant Morgan is now big in America, with his own talk show on CNN. Over there only the gun nuts don't like him, although that is admittedly a lot of people.",

The unemployment rate would fall to 7.1% in 2014 from 7.6% this year, the chancellor said, presenting his autumn statement to parliament. Unveiling forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, Osborne said the OBR now expected unemployment in 2015 to be 7% and to continue falling after that to hit 5.6% in 2018. The OBR now expects the total number of jobs to rise by 400,000 this year. The chancellor told parliament: \"And this is being felt right across the country \u2013 since 2010 the number of jobs in Carlisle and on the Wirral, from Selby to South Tyneside \u2013 have all grown faster than in London.\" \"Meanwhile, the number of people claiming unemployment benefit has fallen by over 200,000 in the last six months \u2013 the largest such fall for sixteen years,\" he added. Osborne also highlighted the 17-year low for the proportion of workless households and rebuffed arguments from the opposition that private sector businesses would not be able to make up for public sector job cuts. \"Businesses have already created three jobs for every one lost in the public sector,\" Osborne said in his speech. \"And the OBR report today forecasts this will continue: with 3.1 million more jobs being created by businesses by 2019 that, in their words, more than offsets the million or so reduction in the public sector head count.\" The OBR's forecast for 2014 unemployment at 7.1% compares with a prediction of 8% at the time of the March budget. The jobless rate has gained more attention in recent months since new Bank of England governor Mark Carney announced a 7% unemployment threshold at which policymakers would consider raising interest rates from their current record low. The OBR's forecast compares with an International Monetary Fund prediction for UK unemployment to ease to 7.5% in 2014 from 7.7% this year. On youth unemployment, the chancellor announced the government would abolish the jobs tax on young people under the age of 21 and fund jobcentres to help teenagers find an apprenticeship or a traineeship. \"At present, Jobcentre Plus does almost nothing to help 16 and 17-year-olds who aren't in work or education,\" he conceded.
