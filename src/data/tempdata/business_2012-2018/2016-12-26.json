      "bodyText": "Beijing has signalled plans to curb Chinese firms\u2019 investment in foreign assets, after revealing that companies from China are on course to spend 1.12 trillion yuan (\u00a3130bn) on everything from British football clubs to a Hollywood film producer in 2016. Companies from China ramped up their spending on overseas assets during the year, as a weakening domestic economy saw investors turn their attention overseas. A diverse array of targets included the maker of Godzilla, Aston Villa Football Club and the pub in which former prime minister David Cameron and Chinese premier Xi Jinping once shared a pint. The spending spree boosted non-financial overseas investment 55% in the first 11 months of 2016, putting Chinese companies on course to spend \u00a3130bn this year, compared with \u00a386bn in 2015, said commerce minister Gao Hucheng. While foreign investment has soared, the amount of money flowing into the country is set to remain broadly flat at \u00a392bn. This means the difference between investments abroad and those coming into China has reached an unprecedented \u00a339bn. The widening gap has triggered concerns about capital flight, where investors send their money out of the country rather than investing it to spur domestic growth. Gao signalled that Beijing would move to address the investment gap by reining in Chinese firms\u2019 overseas spending and making it easier for firms from abroad to access the Chinese economy. He said the government would \u201cpromote the healthy and orderly development of outbound investment and cooperation in 2017\u201d, in remarks at a conference that were published on the commerce ministry\u2019s website. In November it was reported that China was preparing a clampdown on non-Chinese mergers and acquisitions. Separately, the ministry said on its blog that China would sharply reduce restrictions on foreign investment access in 2017 to make it easier for overseas firms to spend their cash in the People\u2019s Republic. No details were given on what restrictions would be changed. Major Chinese investors have spread their investment around the world and across multiple sectors during 2016. One of the most high-profile purchases was part of a multi-billion dollar bet on high-end US real estate by Chinese buyers. Insurer Anbang spent $6.5bn (\u00a35.3bn) on luxury group Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts from private equity group Blackstone, continuing a flood of Chinese money into prime US property. The deal came two years after the same firm paid Hilton Hotels $1.95bn for the Waldorf Astoria in New York, a landmark art deco building ranked among the world\u2019s most fabled hotels. British assets have also proved tempting for Chinese firms and wealthy businessmen looking to add to their already sizeable clutch of UK investments. State-backed China General Nuclear took a 30% stake in the \u00a324bn Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, helping France\u2019s government-owned energy group EDF fund the project. While Hinkley was the highest-profile Chinese foray into the UK, its investors have also showed they are partial to English football clubs, particularly those from the West Midlands. Entrepreneur Guochan Lai bought West Bromwich Albion for a sum thought to be between \u00a3150m and \u00a3200m earlier this year. Businessman Tony Xia spent \u00a376m to buy Aston Villa, even after the club had been relegated from the Premier League, vowing to restore the club to its former glory. Investment group Fosun International paid \u00a345m to gain control of Wolverhampton Wanderers. Among the larger British acquisitions by Chinese firms in 2016 was the \u00a31.4bn that travel firm Ctrip.com paid for flight comparison website Skyscanner. The takeover was announced just a day after the chancellor, Philip Hammond, promised to stem the flow of British firms being sold to foreign investors before reaching their full potential. Government-backed SinoFortone sealed a much smaller but diplomatically significant deal when it bought a 16th-century Buckinghamshire pub for an undisclosed fee. The Plough at Cadsden, Buckinghamshire \u2013 a rural tavern near Chequers, the official country retreat used by British prime ministers \u2013 hosted former PM David Cameron and Chinese premier Xi Jinping during a diplomatic visit that saw them set the world to rights over a pint of Greene King IPA. Chinese investors were also involved in the consortium that agreed to pay \u00a313.8bn by a majority stake in the National Grid\u2019s gas pipeline network. This year\u2019s deals increase the scale of investment into the UK from China, which already owns or holds large stakes in household names such as Weetabix, Pizza Express and Thames Water. One huge deal that was agreed this year but may not complete until early 2017 is ChemChina\u2019s $43bn takeover of Swiss seeds and pesticides giant Syngenta. The deal would be China\u2019s largest ever foreign acquisition and is seen as a key plank of its strategy to ensure food security for its huge population. The bright lights of Hollywood have also attracted Chinese money. Investment group Wanda, headed by China\u2019s richest man Wang Jianlin, paid $3.5bn for the Legendary studio behind films including Godzilla and Pacific Rim. Elsewhere, copper-processing company Anhui Xinke New Materials proved a more unlikely investor in the silver screen. The firm paid $350m for the company that owns Voltage, the studio behind Oscar-winning films The Hurt Locker and Dallas Buyers\u2019 Club. Five major Chinese investments in 2016 \u00a36bn \u2013 China General Nuclear will have a 30% stake in the UK\u2019s Hinkley Point C nuclear power project, approved this year. \u00a35.3bn \u2013 Insurer Anbang bought Strategic Hotels &amp; Resorts from private equity group Blackstone. \u00a32.8bn \u2013 The Dalian Wanda conglomerate bought Legendary studios, which made Godzilla and Pacific Rim. \u00a31.4bn \u2013 Flight comparison site Skyscanner sold to Chinese travel firm Ctrip. \u00a3300m \u2013 Chinese businessmen and investors spent a combined \u00a3300m on three West Midlands football clubs, West Bromwich Albion, Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers.",

      "bodyText": "British bargain hunters have shunned high streets and shopping centres this Boxing Day, according to early indications that highlight the growing competition faced by traditional retailers from online stores. Retailers sought to put a positive spin on trade on one of their most crucial days of the year, but early estimates of Boxing Day footfall, a measure of shopper numbers, showed it was down 7.2% on a year ago by 4pm. The decline was driven by a 15.5% drop in shopping centre footfall and 4.7% decline in those visiting Britain\u2019s high streets, according to the figures from retail analysts Springboard. Out-of-town stores did not fare quite so badly, with their footfall down just 3% on Boxing Day 2015. Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s insights director, estimated that once figures for the full 24 hours were in they would show a Boxing Day drop of about 5% on a year ago. The decline in footfall follows signs of slowdown in retail sales amid rising consumer worries about inflation and the uncertain economic outlook after the Brexit vote. Stores traditionally targeted by Boxing Day bargain hunters continued to report strong trade and there were signs the weak pound was helping to bolster takings from tourists. In London, Harrods said it was expecting a busy Boxing Day to build on a strong run-up to Christmas when it had achieved double-digit sales growth on a year ago. The managing director of the luxury department store, Michael Ward, said butlers were on hand on Monday to serve queues of shoppers coffee and croissants. \u201cI have to say we have never seen numbers like it, 20 minutes after we opened they were still streaming in from Sloane Street,\u201d said Ward. \u201cChristmas has been particularly strong this year,\u201d he said, highlighting solid demand for bags, shoes and diamonds, with Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci among the most popular brands. Ward said Harrods had been insulated from the economic gloom emerging in the UK since the Brexit vote. \u201cThe top end of the market is always less affected than anyone else. The second [factor] is to an extent London is a bit of a bubble in the UK. So from our perspective we\u2019ve got great local customers plus we\u2019ve seen more international customers come to London,\u201d he said. Harrods, like other UK retailers, has benefited from tourist spending since the pound\u2019s sharp fall against other currencies after the EU referendum in June. The pound\u2019s weakness has meant tourists\u2019 spending money here stretches further and official figures show a jump in watch and jewellery sales after the Brexit vote. Ward said the weak pound was only part of the picture in the pickup in spending at Harrods by visitors from China, Thailand, Malaysia, the US and the Middle East. \u201cTo some extent, it\u2019s the pound being weaker but also London is seen as a much safer place to come and shop. So the atrocities in France and in Germany have meant that people will centre on London as a destination that they feel safer in,\u201d he said. In Sheffield, the Meadowhall centre was expecting its busiest day of the year with 160,000 shoppers on Boxing Day. Its director, Darren Pearce, said shoppers had queued from 2am, six hours before opening time. Despite some surveys showing a dip in consumer confidence and rising worries about inflation, Pearce said the centre had been busy this Christmas. \u201cThe week leading up to Christmas was our busiest of the year, with bestselling toys including Nerf Guns, Hatchimals and Lego Star Wars, according to our retailers. The parka jacket for men, women and kids has also been a top seller,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a big year on jewellery once again with shoppers making a beeline for luxury items \u2026 Branded handbags and premium cosmetics \u2026 have also been big sellers. And vinyl\u2019s making a comeback.\u201d Selfridges also sought to send an upbeat message about Boxing Day trade and said customers were queuing from the early hours for sale items. It took \u00a32m in the first hour of trade across its four stores and online. Intu, the owner, manager and developer of regional shopping centres at sites including Braehead, Gateshead and Milton Keynes, also said it was expecting heavy footfall. Gordon McKinnon, operations director at Intu, said: \u201cThis morning, we saw die-hard shoppers brave the winter cold and queue up early to ensure they had first pick of the bargains. Across the UK, we witnessed large queues of shoppers all waiting to get their hands on discounted products at the leading retailers.\u201d In Cardiff, the St David\u2019s shopping centre also said it was busy. The general manager, Steven Madeley, said: \u201cThe mall has been packed with tens of thousands of shoppers treating themselves and spending gift cards they\u2019ve received as presents.\u201d",

The second [factor] is to an extent London is a bit of a bubble in the UK. So from our perspective we\u2019ve got great local customers plus we\u2019ve seen more international customers come to London,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Harrods, like other UK retailers, has benefited from tourist spending since the pound\u2019s sharp fall against other currencies after the EU referendum in June. The pound\u2019s weakness has meant tourists\u2019 spending money here stretches further and official figures show a jump in watch and jewellery sales after the Brexit vote.</p> <p>Ward said the weak pound was only part of the picture in the pickup in spending at Harrods by visitors from China, Thailand, Malaysia, the US and the Middle East.</p> <p>\u201cTo some extent, it\u2019s the pound being weaker but also London is seen as a much safer place to come and shop. So the atrocities in France and in Germany have meant that people will centre on London as a destination that they feel safer in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In Sheffield, the Meadowhall centre was expecting its busiest day of the year with 160,000 shoppers on Boxing Day. Its director, Darren Pearce, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/26/uk-shoppers-brave-boxing-day-sales-westfield\">shoppers had queued from 2am</a>, six hours before opening time. </p> <p>Despite some surveys showing a dip in consumer confidence and rising worries about inflation, Pearce said the centre had been busy this Christmas.</p> <p>\u201cThe week leading up to Christmas was our busiest of the year, with bestselling toys including Nerf Guns, Hatchimals and Lego Star Wars, according to our retailers. The parka jacket for men, women and kids has also been a top seller,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a big year on jewellery once again with shoppers making a beeline for luxury items \u2026 Branded handbags and premium cosmetics \u2026 have also been big sellers. And vinyl\u2019s making a comeback.\u201d</p> <p>Selfridges also sought to send an upbeat message about Boxing Day trade and said customers were queuing from the early hours for sale items. It took \u00a32m in the first hour of trade across its four stores and online.</p> <p>Intu, the owner, manager and developer of regional shopping centres at sites including Braehead, Gateshead and Milton Keynes, also said it was expecting heavy footfall.</p> <p>Gordon McKinnon, operations director at Intu, said: \u201cThis morning, we saw die-hard shoppers brave the winter cold and queue up early to ensure they had first pick of the bargains. Across the UK, we witnessed large queues of shoppers all waiting to get their hands on discounted products at the leading retailers.\u201d</p> <p>In Cardiff, the St David\u2019s shopping centre also said it was busy. The general manager, Steven Madeley, said: \u201cThe mall has been packed with tens of thousands of shoppers treating themselves and spending gift cards they\u2019ve received as presents.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A bailout of struggling Italian bank Monte dei Paschi should not be seen as a done deal, a key European Central Bank policymaker has said. Jens Weidmann, president of Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, said the Italian government ought to consider whether it should rescue the bank if it is in a bad financial state. \u201cFor the measures planned by the Italian government the bank has to be financially healthy at its core,\u201d he said in an article published German newspaper Bild. \u201cThe money cannot be used to cover losses that are already expected. All this must be carefully examined,\u201d added Weidmann, a member of the ECB\u2019s governing council. The ECB has taken a tough line with Italy\u2019s third-largest bank, refusing to give it more time to find private investment. The Italian government approved a state bailout plan last Friday after the Siena-based bank, which can trace its roots back to 1472, failed to convince investors to fund a \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.25bn) cash injection. It plans to dip into a \u20ac20bn fund approved by the government earlier this month for the purpose of propping the bank up if no rescue plan could be secured elsewhere. The bailout plan was spurred by Monte dei Paschi\u2019s poor results in ECB \u201cstress tests\u201d, a system set up by the European Union after the financial crisis to measure banks\u2019 resilience to unexpected economic shocks. Stress tests are intended to ensure that taxpayers are not asked to pick up the tab for multi-billion pound bailouts, such as those that the British government orchestrated to save Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. Fears about the strength of Monte dei Paschi began to mount after it came last out of 51 European banks in the ECB\u2019s latest round of tests in July. The bank was told to shore up its finances by the end of the year or face being wound down. \u201cThese (rules) are meant especially to protect taxpayers and put responsibility on investors. State funds are only intended as a last resort, and that is why the bar is set high,\u201d Weidmann told Bild. Monte dei Paschi\u2019s problems have piled up since the 2008 banking crisis, when it paid \u20ac9bn (\u00a37.6bn) for Banca Antonveneta. The deal doubled its size and turned it into Italy\u2019s third largest bank behind UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo. It bought Banca Atonveneta from Santander, which had acquired the Italian bank during the three-way bid for Dutch bank ABN Amro, a deal that was a key factor in the taxpayer bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Three years ago Monte dei Paschi\u2019s problems escalated. The Sienese bank asked the government for \u20ac4bn amid a scandal over loss-making derivatives contracts and alleged fraud. It has gone back to the the government for funds after talks with private investors failed, with Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund thought to have scuppered the plan by refusing to take part. The Italian government already has a 4% stake in Monte dei Paschi.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers are bracing for more swings in the exchange rate and rising costs, as the start of Brexit negotiations in 2017 threatens to keep the pound under pressure. Factories have had to cope with sharp rises in energy and raw material costs in recent months as the weak pound makes imports to the UK more expensive. For manufacturers that export there has been a small silver lining as the fall in the pound since the Brexit vote has made their goods cheaper to overseas buyers, but that boost has only partially offset the pressure from higher costs. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says that six months on from the EU referendum, its members in the manufacturing industry have become more worried about moves in the pound and about inflation. Its poll of 1,775 manufacturers showed 56% felt that the exchange rate was more of a concern to their business than three months ago, up from 48% in September. There was also an increase in the proportion worried about rising prices, reflecting official figures for November that showed manufacturers faced the sharpest rise in their costs for five years. The BCC survey found 26% of manufacturers now saw inflation as more of a concern, up from 21% three months ago. Suren Thiru, the BCC\u2019s head of economics, highlighted the pressures on manufacturers from the pound\u2019s drop since the referendum which has seen it lose its value 17% against the dollar and 10% against the euro. \u201cWhile the post-referendum slump in the value of sterling is benefiting some exporters, a weak currency is something of a double-edged sword, as many UK exporters also import goods and raw materials, so will be facing higher input costs,\u201d he said. The business group wants more help for firms to offset the pressures from the Brexit process, which has already shown signs of slowing business investment and knocking consumer confidence. Thiru highlighted business rates, a tax that firms pay on their commercial property, as one cost that could be lowered by the government. \u201cUncertainty over future currency movements is also a growing concern for businesses. With further expected rises in the US interest rate in the coming months likely to place further downward pressure on sterling, it is vital that more is done to address the high input costs faced by businesses, particularly business rates.\u201d The economic news since the vote to leave the EU in June has generally defied gloomy predictions of a sharp slowdown from forecasters like the Bank of England and International Monetary Fund. But the most recent indicators suggest the Brexit vote is starting to be felt and that the effects will become more pronounced in 2017 when negotiations over the leaving the EU being in earnest. The latest official figures on inflation suggest the weak pound is now feeding through to prices paid by consumers, particularly for fuel. Inflation hit a two-year high of 1.2% last month and forecasters expect it to continue rising and approach 3% in 2017. The jobs market has also shown signs of strain. The pace of hiring has eased off and there has been a jump in the number of people considered \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d \u2013 out of work and not looking for work. Consumer confidence polls have pointed to growing worries about the economic outlook and about inflation in particular. Thinktanks have warned higher prices and a slowdown in wage growth will squeeze household incomes. There have also been indications that business investment is slowing but a separate poll from the Institute of Directors (IoD) suggested firms were still willing to spend and expand in 2017. Its survey of 844 business leaders suggested they were cautiously upbeat about the year ahead. More than 60% were optimistic or very optimistic about their prospects in 2017, and the net optimism against pessimism figure, at 50%, was the highest since the vote to leave the EU in June. But business bosses also warned of a number of concerns that could see their expectations prove over-optimistic. Half felt current UK economic conditions were having a negative effect on their business\u2019 growth, and 45% felt an uncertain trading status with the EU was holding them back. There were also worries about skills shortages amid the prospect of an immigration clampdown after Brexit.",

The pace of hiring has eased off and there has been a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/14/uk-unemployment-rate-pay-growth-jobless-ons\">jump in the number of people considered \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d</a> \u2013 out of work and not looking for work. Consumer confidence polls have pointed to growing worries about the economic outlook and about inflation in particular. Thinktanks have warned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/24/ifs-warnsf-biggest-squeeze-on-pay-for-70-years-autumn-statement\">higher prices and a slowdown in wage growth will squeeze household incomes</a>.<br></p> <p>There have also been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/06/uk-investment-ons-consumer-spending-retail-manufacturing\">indications that business investment is slowing</a> but a separate poll from the Institute of Directors (IoD) suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/19/business-giants-expand-workforces-2017-despite-brexit-worries-jobs-cbi-unemployment\">firms were still willing to spend and expand in 2017</a>. </p> <p>Its survey of 844 business leaders suggested they were cautiously upbeat about the year ahead. More than 60% were optimistic or very optimistic about their prospects in 2017, and the net optimism against pessimism figure, at 50%, was the highest since the vote to leave the EU in June. </p> <p>But business bosses also warned of a number of concerns that could see their expectations prove over-optimistic. Half felt current UK economic conditions were having a negative effect on their business\u2019 growth, and 45% felt an uncertain trading status with the EU was holding them back. There were also worries about skills shortages amid the prospect of an immigration clampdown after Brexit.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "While many people were still sleeping off the extra calories \u2013 and alcohol \u2013 consumed on Christmas Day, millions of the nation\u2019s hardcore shoppers had set their alarms, ready to be up and out to bag the biggest bargains on Boxing Day. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, representing stores on Bond, Oxford and Regent streets, said average footfall was up 8% year-on-year at 11am, with turnover for the day expected to reach \u00a355m. Chinese shoppers were giving the West End a boost, with luxury handbags among the most popular items. At the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London, the most dedicated started queueing at 2am. By the time the doors opened at 5am hundreds of shoppers were ready to flood through the doors. \u201cIt was chaos,\u201d said one security guard. \u201cThey were pushing, complaining, arguing about little things like schoolkids. And for what? You\u2019re going to get to Next, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Syed Ali, 27, went straight to the shops with his wife and children after working a 24-hour shift in security. \u201cIt was a bit cold but what really annoyed me was people trying to push in the queue \u2013 people were jumping in, shouting at you. There is no need for that,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be honest we are just buying everything for the kids,\u201d he said, piles of clothes around his feet. \u201cThat\u2019s why I worked for the last 24 hours to make money to spend on them \u2013 if there is anything left, maybe then we\u2019ll get something for ourselves.\u201d Next was, as always, one of the biggest draws for the early shoppers. Britain\u2019s biggest clothing retailer is one of the few big chains not to slash prices before Christmas \u2013 although its sale did begin online at 3pm on 24 December. Ling Lin, 29, did not let the fact that she was seven months pregnant prevent her getting among the crowds, and had spent about \u00a31,300 by 8.30am. Her only concession to her condition seemed to be that she was willing to take a rest after filling seven large bags fit to burst. \u201cBut I think I have saved at least \u00a31,000 in the Next sale,\u201d she said. \u201cI love it, I love shopping and I always do the sales \u2013 and I don\u2019t know when I will be able to shop again for a while.\u201d While millions headed to the shops on Boxing Day, before Brexit-related price rises are expected to trickle down to the high street, retail experts warned that pre-Christmas discounting, online sales and the introduction of Black Friday could depress footfall. Retailers have already struggled in 2016, according to retail analyst Richard Hyman. \u201cIt has been extraordinarily tough without any impact from Brexit at all. For the last two and a half years, we\u2019ve had price deflation in virtually every sector,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2016, on average more than 60% of UK retailers have been on sale. I\u2019ve never seen a market like this. Sales used to be used to clear stock. That\u2019s a thing of the past. Now there is a permanent sale.\u201d The overall number of people who visit the shops in December has declined in six of the past seven consecutive years, according to retail analysts Springboard. The chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson, said the fourth year of falling shop prices suggested shoppers would mean permanent competition between retailers. \u201cThe outlook for 2017 is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a triple whammy of cost pressures \u2013 inflation coming through, an unreformed business rate system, another year of uplift in the national living wage and apprenticeship levies \u2013 and all of these at the same time as a market that\u2019s not growing very quickly. \u201cBut we know they\u2019re a resilient and enterprising bunch and there will be a lot of businesses that rise to the environment really well.\u201d Consumer and retail expert Kate Hardcastle said there had been a permanent shift in shopping habits. \u201cThis is the time of year where, after a good sales period, [retailers] normally slash the prices to encourage extra footfall and get rid of stock they don\u2019t want, but that is no longer the case,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the introduction of Black Friday \u2026 when you start discounting that early you set a pattern that the consumer desires. Add on to that the changes in how we shop now and the trends emerging from online shopping: the fact we can use devices like smartphones to access everything we want. There has very much been a changing face to the way we shop.\u201d However, no one seemed to have told the shoppers in Stratford. Westfield said more than 100,000 people came through the doors of its two giant shopping centres in London by 1pm on Boxing Day, with \u00a3500,000 spent every hour over the Christmas period. Myf Ryan, chief marketing officer for Westfield UK and Europe, said: \u201cFor many shoppers, the annual Boxing Day sales continue to be an important date in the diary. Many people will have received spending money or gift cards for Christmas, and use Boxing Day as an opportunity to treat themselves, as well as spending time with family and friends.\u201d Boxing Day was still the most popular post-Christmas shopping day among UK consumers, according to Dom Joseph, chief executive of advertising technology company Captify. A record \u00a3984m is expected to be spent online on Boxing Day, up from the \u00a3805m spent on Christmas Day. Angela Jordan, 51, had decided to cover all the bases, and do her shopping online and in store. \u201cI\u2019ve already bought everything I wanted online \u2013 so what am I doing here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit sad, but I sneaked away yesterday and did most of it then.\u201d Ozay Kirik, who was waiting for designer clothing store Choice to open, said he wanted to be able to try things on. \u201cIt\u2019s different, there\u2019s more of an atmosphere,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe I can do my shopping at home in bed, but I can\u2019t feel it, I can\u2019t try it on. It\u2019s less hassle to come here than get it sent and then send it back because it doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d As the queues started to grow and lines into the most popular shops started operating a holding policy one family had taken time out to eat the breakfast they had brought with them. Alpana Jain and her 13-year-old son, Kshitij, had come from Delhi to visit family and try out the Boxing Day sales for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s very different,\u201d she said. \u201cIn Delhi sales are a lot more relaxed and last longer.\u201d Her son-in-law, Rajat Gupta, laughed and added: \u201cTo be honest I just don\u2019t think people are crazy enough in Delhi to start queuing at five in the morning.\u201d",

    "webTitle": "Philip Green demands Dominic Chappell pays into BHS pension deal", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green wants the Pensions Regulator to force Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, to put money into the failed retailer\u2019s pension fund as part of any settlement to resolve the \u00a3571m deficit in the scheme. Green has made a payment into the scheme from Chappell or his company Retail Acquisitions a condition of any rescue deal, according to sources close to negotiations. BHS collapsed into administration in April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a \u00a3571m pension black hole. The demise of the 88-year-old retailer sparked a public and political outcry because Green and Chappell, the former owners, made millions from the business. Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a former bankrupt, for \u00a31. During his ownership, the Green family and other shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from BHS. Chappell\u2019s company Retail Acquisitions received payments of up to \u00a325m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed. Green promised to \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme in June when he appeared in front of a parliamentary committee, but no deal has been forthcoming. The Pensions Regulator has started legal proceedings against Green and Chappell in an attempt to force them to fill the deficit. It is understood to be seeking around \u00a3350m from Green and as much as \u00a317m from Chappell. However, a source close to the situation confirmed that negotiations have taken place between Green and the regulator since it initiated legal action in November. Those involved in the talks believe a settlement could be agreed early in the new year, before the regulator proceeds to the next stage. As part of any deal, it is understood that Green wants the regulator to ensure that Chappell pays into the pension scheme as well. The billionaire tycoon believes he was misled by Chappell about his track record in business and the money that Retail Acquisitions was paid by BHS. Green declined to comment. Chappell told the Guardian that he fulfilled all his duties as a director of BHS and \u201cat no stage did we trade immorally\u201d. He blamed Green for the collapse of BHS because of his failure to support the pension scheme after he sold the retail chain. Chappell said he had agreed a \u201cdeal in principle\u201d with the regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, the government-backed lifeboat scheme, to restructure the pension fund before BHS collapsed. This involved Green pumping in \u00a3127m, BHS making annual contributions for the next five years, and the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) taking a 30% stake in the retailer. However, Green did not agree to the proposal, according to Chappell. The former owner of BHS also criticised the conduct of the Pensions Regulator, saying that the retailer was \u201cscrewed\u201d by the investigation into the pension scheme shortly after it was sold by Green. This prevented Retail Acquisitions hiring a top chief executive and affected its finances, Chappell said. \u201cA big notice to them, why don\u2019t they look themselves in the mirror and look at how they behaved through the whole process?\u201d A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe have issued warning notices setting out evidence for use of our contribution notice power and our financial support direction power, to a number of parties including Sir Philip Green. \u201cThe warning notice is an important milestone in our work to obtain redress for the thousands of members of the BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own. \u201cThose who have received the warning notices now have the right to make representations to us, which we will consider and respond. At that stage, if we decide to progress the case, it will be heard by our determinations panel, which is independent of the case team and will determine whether to exercise the powers in this case. We cannot give specific timeframes but we would expect a panel hearing during 2017. \u201cWe remain in discussion with Sir Philip\u2019s advisers. Any settlement offer we accept has to be robust enough to stand the test of time and mean that members and the PPF are not left in a worse position further down the road.\u201d Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the PPF, added: \u201cThe BHS pension schemes remain in the PPF assessment period, and members continue to be protected and paid at PPF levels of compensation. \u201cThis means members who were retired when we started looking at the schemes will continue to receive 100% of what was in payment, while members who retired since then will receive 90% of what they were promised, subject to a cap. \u201cWe are working closely with the BHS pension trustees who continue to administer the schemes. Meanwhile the liquidator is now working to maximise the recovery to the pension schemes.\u201d",

The demise of the 88-year-old retailer sparked a public and political outcry because Green and Chappell, the former owners, made millions from the business. </p> <p>Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a former bankrupt, for \u00a31. During his ownership, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/21/sir-philip-green-bhs-mps-pension-schemes\">the Green family and other shareholders collected at least \u00a3580m from BHS.</a> Chappell\u2019s company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration\">Retail Acquisitions received payments of up to \u00a325m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/15/bhs-pension-problems-can-be-solved-sir-philip-green-tells-mps\">Green promised to \u201csort\u201d the problems facing the BHS pension scheme in June</a> when he appeared in front of a parliamentary committee, but no deal has been forthcoming. The Pensions Regulator has<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/02/philip-green-may-be-forced-to-pay-money-into-bhs-pension-scheme\"> started legal proceedings against Green and Chappell</a> in an attempt to force them to fill the deficit. It is understood to be seeking around \u00a3350m from Green and as much as \u00a317m from Chappell.</p> <p>However, a source close to the situation confirmed that negotiations have taken place between Green and the regulator since it initiated legal action in November. Those involved in the talks believe a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/16/pensions-regulator-bhs-coats-group-legal-proceedings\">settlement</a> could be agreed early in the new year, before the regulator proceeds to the next stage.</p> <p>As part of any deal, it is understood that Green wants the regulator to ensure that Chappell pays into the pension scheme as well. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/25/philip-green-threatens-to-sue-bhs-buyer-dominic-chappell\">The billionaire tycoon believes he was misled by Chappell about his track record in business</a> and the money that Retail Acquisitions was paid by BHS.</p> <p>Green declined to comment. Chappell told the Guardian that he fulfilled all his duties as a director of BHS and \u201cat no stage did we trade immorally\u201d. He blamed Green for the collapse of BHS because of his failure to support the pension scheme after he sold the retail chain. Chappell said he had agreed a \u201cdeal in principle\u201d with the regulator and the Pension Protection Fund, the government-backed lifeboat scheme, to restructure the pension fund before BHS collapsed. This involved Green pumping in \u00a3127m, BHS making annual contributions for the next five years, and the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) taking a 30% stake in the retailer. However, Green did not agree to the proposal, according to Chappell.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"823376b83aa8fe511236f75393617724bd75be77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/823376b83aa8fe511236f75393617724bd75be77/0_208_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The last day of business at a branch of BHS.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The retail chain collapsed in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former owner of BHS also criticised the conduct of the Pensions Regulator, saying that the retailer was \u201cscrewed\u201d by the investigation into the pension scheme shortly after it was sold by Green. This prevented Retail Acquisitions hiring a top chief executive and affected its finances, Chappell said.</p> <p>\u201cA big notice to them, why don\u2019t they look themselves in the mirror and look at how they behaved through the whole process?\u201d </p> <p>A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said: \u201cWe have issued warning notices setting out evidence for use of our contribution notice power and our financial support direction power, to a number of parties including Sir Philip Green.</p> <p>\u201cThe warning notice is an important milestone in our work to obtain redress for the thousands of members of the BHS schemes who have been placed in this position through no fault of their own.</p> <p>\u201cThose who have received the warning notices now have the right to make representations to us, which we will consider and respond. At that stage, if we decide to progress the case, it will be heard by our determinations panel, which is independent of the case team and will determine whether to exercise the powers in this case. We cannot give specific timeframes but we would expect a panel hearing during 2017. </p> <p>\u201cWe remain in discussion with Sir Philip\u2019s advisers. Any settlement offer we accept has to be robust enough to stand the test of time and mean that members and the PPF are not left in a worse position further down the road.\u201d</p> <p>Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the PPF, added: \u201cThe BHS pension schemes remain in the PPF assessment period, and members continue to be protected and paid at PPF levels of compensation. </p> <p>\u201cThis means members who were retired when we started looking at the schemes will continue to receive 100% of what was in payment, while members who retired since then will receive 90% of what they were promised, subject to a cap. </p> <p>\u201cWe are working closely with the BHS pension trustees who continue to administer the schemes. Meanwhile the liquidator is now working to maximise the recovery to the pension schemes.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The digital download, ushered in to the mass market more than a decade ago by Apple\u2019s iTunes music store, is in rapid decline as people shift to streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music. The shift from downloads to streaming is highlighted by the biggest-selling singles of this year and 2006, when Gnarls Barkley\u2019s Crazy became the first download-only song to top the UK charts, in a sign the digital format was eclipsing CD sales. Crazy shifted nearly 661,000 units during its nine weeks at UK No 1 and went on to sell more than 1m downloads. This summer, Drake\u2019s One Dance matched the record achieved by Wet Wet Wet\u2019s Love Is All Around for 15 weeks at No 1 in the UK singles chart \u2013 which now combines download, physical and streaming equivalent sales. By the end of September, it had racked up 1.695m sales, including nearly 505,000 downloads and a whopping 119m streams. Streaming\u2019s advantages are that you can listen to any of millions of tracks whenever you like, and create playlists; paying subscribers can also download individual tracks for offline listening. The disadvantage: if you stop paying the monthly stipend of about \u00a310, the access, playlists and downloads evaporate. By contrast, a purchased download lasts forever \u2013 but it\u2019s the only thing you can listen to. The people who embraced downloading, started in 2003 by Apple\u2019s iTunes music store, were the tech-savvy types who shifted easily over to streaming. Thus the download is in rapid decline \u2013 so much so that at the end of November, the value of sales in the old vinyl format surpassed those of digital in the UK over a week, by \u00a32.4m to \u00a32.1m. At about \u00a320 an album, vinyl sold about 120,000 units, against the equivalent of 2.6m digital tracks costing 79p. But look more closely and the gap isn\u2019t that big: at 10 songs per album, digital downloads were only the equivalent of 260,000 albums. So how much longer do downloads have? A few years and they\u2019re dead, says Mark Mulligan, music analyst at Midia Consulting: \u201cIt\u2019s going to die before the CD. The CD has a fairly universal player, where there\u2019s always at least one in a house. And the people who grew up buying CDs are the older music consumers \u2013 the CD will literally die out only when they do.\u201d Downloads outsold physical formats for the first time in the UK in 2011, when streaming services were in their infancy. But even by 2014 they were falling, from \u00a3397.3m the previous year to \u00a3338.1m, while streaming grew to \u00a3175m. That trend is continuing. Apple still controls the digital download market, with about 65% to 70% of the total, says Mulligan: he suggests that the death knell for downloads will come with a redesign of the iTunes app interface that de-emphasises downloads in favour of the Music subscription streaming service. \u201cLast year downloads declined by 16% in nominal terms,\u201d he says. \u201cThis year they are tracking to decline by between 25% and 30%.\u201d By 2019 the business could be worth just $600m (\u00a3485m) globally, compared with a high of $3.9bn in 2012; by 2020, Apple might decide that the download business isn\u2019t worth troubling with, and make the iTunes store effectively invisible, Mulligan suggests. \u201cThe narrative of services-based music would be complete.\u201d Apple, however, resists the suggestion that it\u2019s about to turn off the download tap. \u201cThere\u2019s no end date \u2026 our music iTunes business is doing very well,\u201d Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice-president of internet software and services, told Billboard magazine in June, on the first anniversary of the Music subscription service. \u201cDownloads weren\u2019t growing, and certainly are not going to grow again, but it\u2019s not declining anywhere near as fast as any of them [in record labels] predicted. There are a lot of people who download music and are happy with it and they\u2019re not moving towards subscriptions.\u201d Cue recently said that 60% of people using Apple Music had not bought content from the iTunes music store in the past 12 months, suggesting they were either \u201clapsed\u201d downloaders, or never were. That makes their monthly revenues all gravy for the music industry, he said. Certainly the good news for labels and musicians is that the streaming services are attracting growing numbers of subscribers, paying monthly fees of up to \u00a310: Spotify has 40 million, and Apple recently said it has passed 20 million. Smaller services such as Deezer and Tidal have a few million between them. However, the music industry, which has fretted that each shift in music format since 1995, from MP3 piracy to downloads to streaming, is driving down revenues, is now so worried about the effect of YouTube on streaming revenues that the US labels tried to push streaming payments on to the agenda of Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ctech summit\u201d in mid-December, when representatives of Apple, Google, Microsoft and others met the US president-elect. What the RIAA, which represents US labels, was complaining about is known in the industry as the \u201cvalue gap\u201d \u2013 the difference in effective per-play payments between audio services such as Spotify, and YouTube. YouTube, though, remains the world\u2019s biggest venue for music streaming, with millions of videos that can be combined into playlists. Hook your phone or computer up to a speaker, and it\u2019s just like Spotify: you\u2019ll get the music, and the audio from any video ads, and then can pick and choose from a huge catalogue. Though the latest figures only cover the first half of 2015, the monitoring service Nielsen reckons that YouTube delivered 60% more music streams than all the on-demand music streaming services combined \u2013 and that the gap had grown since the same period in 2014. The arrival of Apple Music in June 2015 might shift that, but it\u2019s unlikely. What riles the music business is that the amount that YouTube pays it per track played works out as substantially less than Spotify or Apple Music. Whereas the latter two services have complex agreements with the record labels setting a per-play fee, YouTube pays out a share of the ad revenue that any track identified as belonging to a company earns. That tends to be lower than a per-track fee, because advertising prices and value varies enormously. Mulligan says: \u201cVideo consumption went through the roof in 2015, but there weren\u2019t enough ads to put against it \u2013 so the ad revenues paid grew more slowly than consumption.\u201d Hence the RIAA\u2019s push to get streaming payments on to Trump\u2019s mind at the tech summit. It\u2019s unclear whether it succeeded. YouTube says the ad-funded model has transformed the music video from a costly promotional tool into a new source of revenue. \u201cIn the last 12 months, we\u2019ve paid out $1bn to the music industry in ad revenues alone, and are working collaboratively with them to bring more money to artists,\u201d it says. This doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with the music industry. David Price, director of insight at the IFPI, the global trade body for the recording industry, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe YouTube is properly rewarding artists for the huge consumption that\u2019s going on there. But in the last year we have seen the EU take positive steps towards creating a better and fairer licensing environment in Europe.\u201d The BPI, the UK music industry\u2019s trade body, complained in May that artists earn less from YouTube than they do from vinyl. But in the long run, streaming is the only game in town \u2013 along, perhaps, with the CD and vinyl. The download once looked like the future; now, the question is how much more of a future it has.",

It\u2019s unclear whether it succeeded.</p> <p>YouTube says the ad-funded model has transformed the music video from a costly promotional tool into a new source of revenue. \u201cIn the last 12 months, we\u2019ve paid out $1bn to the music industry in ad revenues alone, and are working collaboratively with them to bring more money to artists,\u201d it says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f3dd3bdd90f9357e9ba57a3080099ec6f7d5baa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f3dd3bdd90f9357e9ba57a3080099ec6f7d5baa/15_200_5142_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vinyls are back in vogue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vinyls are back in vogue</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Bowles/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This doesn\u2019t sit comfortably with the music industry. David Price, director of insight at the IFPI, the global trade body for the recording industry, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe YouTube is properly rewarding artists for the huge consumption that\u2019s going on there. But in the last year we have seen the EU take positive steps towards creating a better and fairer licensing environment in Europe.\u201d The BPI, the UK music industry\u2019s trade body, complained in May that artists earn less from YouTube than they do from vinyl.</p> <p>But in the long run, streaming is the only game in town \u2013 along, perhaps, with the CD and vinyl. The download once looked like the future; now, the question is how much more of a future it has. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Millions of Britons are expected to flock to the shops on Boxing Day as they make the most of the honeymoon period before Brexit-related price hikes trickle down to the high street. Some of the country\u2019s biggest shopping centres are predicting bumper crowds as retailers slash the price of their winter clothing, TVs, laptops and furniture ranges. Gordon McKinnon, operations director at Intu, which owns Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead, said it expected more than 1m shoppers to visit its centres. \u201cIt is a huge shopping day because even though there is more discounting before Christmas there are still a lot of retailers, like Next, John Lewis and Selfridges that don\u2019t. There\u2019s a big push from Boxing Day - that\u2019s the emotional bit. People want to go out and get their first fix of the sales.\u201d Retailers across the board have signalled the weakness of sterling will push up prices in 2017 as the cost of importing goods increases. Fashion retailer Next has said its clothing prices will rise by up to 5% while electrical goods retailers Dixons Carphone and AO have also said their suppliers want to charge more. Apple has pushed up the price of every computer in its range, while Microsoft and Dell have also signalled that price hikes are on the way. Myf Ryan, the chief marketing officer at Westfeld UK and Europe, said Boxing Day was the busiest day of the Christmas trading period for its London malls in 2015. \u201cLast year over 330,000 shoppers visited our two Westfield centres in London and this year we are expecting similar numbers,\u201d she said. \u201cDuring the Christmas period last year, shoppers spent over \u00a3500,000 per hour.\u201d Despite the pictures of crowded high streets at this time of year, Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, says the overall number of people who physically visit the shops in December has declined in six of the last seven consecutive years - a worrying trend for retailers that helps explain why so many resort to offering pre-Christmas discounts. Wehrle says shopper numbers were down by more than 2% in the first half of December but that the decline was less than the 3% drop recorded in 2015. \u201cWe are losing fewer people every year while online is growing but at a slower rate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a boom year [for retailers] but it\u2019s not a bad year either. Unlike Black Friday, Boxing Day is part of the holiday and culturally has a lot of significance.\u201d Retailers in London\u2019s West End are expected to outperform the national picture as the devaluation of sterling since the Brexit vote draws high spending tourists to its high end department stores and luxury brands. Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of New West End Company - which represents retailers in Oxford Street, Regent Street and Bond Street - predicted today would be one of the district\u2019s most successful single shopping days in recent years. Takings are expected to hit \u00a355m. \u201cBoxing Day is becoming increasingly popular as a shopping day as customers become savvier, more price sensitive and better at researching purchases,\u201d said Tyrell. \u201cWe expect a significantly higher number of Chinese tourists to come over specifically to bargain hunt.\u201d While the total number of transactions in the West End last week was actually down by more than 14% in the week before Christmas, the average \u201cbasket value\u201d increased by 28%, highlighting the impact of the currency effect. The average value of a Chinese shopper\u2019s purchase was nearly five times higher than that of a domestic shopper, at \u00a31,073 versus \u00a3212, said Tyrell. The pull of the Boxing day sales belies the 24 hour shopping trend ushered in by the internet. With many retailers launching sales online on Christmas Eve, the shops never really close anymore, although this year there has been a push by several retailers, including Fat Face and jeweller Beaverbrooks to stay closed on Boxing Day. John Lewis has never opened the day after Christmas. According to data compiled by the association for online retailers IMRG, an estimated \u00a3805m will have been spent on the virtual high street yesterday [25th December] as Britons immediately cashed in gift cards, received as presents, to download games and music and take advantage of early bird sales. It predicts close to \u00a31bn will be spent online again today. Boxing Day Deals Currys PC World\u2019s best offers include a 49\u2013inch Samsung 4K Ultra HD TV for \u00a3649 - a \u00a3250 reduction - and GoPro Hero+ camcorders half price at \u00a399.99. Offers at Habitat include the Pedley shelving unit, half price at \u00a3250 and the Abu coffee table, down from \u00a3180 to \u00a380. For fans of designer fashion, Whistles has slashed the price of the Mia patchwork sheepskin coat by \u00a3600 to \u00a31,200. Its Drew collarless leather biker jacket is also half price at \u00a3180. At footwear chain Office there is \u00a350 off UGGs with the Australian brand\u2019s classic short boots selling for \u00a3105 while white Adidas Superstar 80s are \u00a350 - a reduction of nearly 40%. Kitchen outfitter Magnet is trumpeting a half price sale with the Fusion Champagne kitchen (based on 8 units with laminate worktops) down from \u00a310,420 to \u00a34,789. Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s homewares sale includes the Austen small corner sofa, which is half price at \u00a3999.50, while in clothing M&amp;S Collection angular heel knee high boots are half price at \u00a325. The deals on website Very.co.uk include a \u00a3180 saving on a Christie storage bed frame, at \u00a3219, and more than 30% off a 14\u201d HP laptop at \u00a3359.99. Debenhams says it has slashed more than \u00a3130m off prices in its stores today with \u00a375 knocked off a Butterfly by Matthew Williamson embroidered dress at \u00a3175 and bottles of Sarah Jessica Parker Lovely perfume going for half price at \u00a317. Eyecatching deals at Anthropologie include the statement floral burst chandelier, which at \u00a32,179.95 is more than half price. There is also 30% off the Taunton reversible sheepskin gilet at \u00a3390.95.

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets are preparing to fly in emergency salad from the US after heavy rains and flooding in Spain hit supplies. About 80% of fresh produce \u2013 including leafy salads as well as celery and broccoli \u2013 sold in the UK at this time of year comes from the Murcia region in southern Spain. Suppliers spoken to by the Guardian said yields in the region had dropped to as low as 30% of those expected at this time of year on some crops, such as little gem lettuces, as farmers\u2019 fields were inundated last weekend. Celery yields have dropped to 40% of normal levels while some citrus crops, including satsumas and clementines, have also been affected. \u201cThere has been a deluge of flooding in that part of Spain and they have got blocked roads, flooded dispatch facilities and mobile rigs for picking as well as crops that have been washed away,\u201d said Anthony Gardiner of G\u2019s, a major supplier to the supermarkets with operations in the UK and Spain. He said the past week had been \u201cincredibly challenging\u201d and that supply difficulties could last for weeks. This week farmers have struggled to access fields and organise deliveries amid heavy flooding that had left roads and some workers\u2019 homes deluged. But the loss of newly planted seedlings means there is likely to be further shortages into January and February, just as Brits seek out salad for their new year health kick. One wholesaler said some supermarkets were planning to fly in stock from the US and at least one supermarket confirmed it would do so. \u201cThese have been among the worst downpours we have seen since these farms were established in the 1980s,\u201d a spokeswoman for the British Leafy Salads Association told trade journal the Grocer. \u201cThe rainfall has been so intense that the ground is saturated and there is nowhere for the excess water to go.\u201d Andy Weir at Reynolds, which supplies national restaurant chains including Pizza Express and Carluccio\u2019s, said: \u201cWe have managed to maintain availability as we buy from contracted growers and they have pulled out all the stops. There is a massive shortage in the market and if you don\u2019t have a contract of supply you will struggle.\u201d He said difficulty in organising new planting to replace lost seedlings was likely to mean salad supply problems would emerge again in February and March when those crops should be harvested. Some supermarkets including Sainsbury\u2019s and Aldi had signs up warning shoppers they were experiencing salad shortages ahead of Christmas. A spokesperson for Sainsbury\u2019s said: \u201cThere has been limited supply of our iceberg and gem lettuce due to weather conditions in Spain but deliveries to stores are now taking place. We are doing all we can to ensure customers can buy the lettuce of their choice for Christmas and Boxing Day.\u201d Aldi said it was experiencing shortages in some areas, but Tesco and Morrisons said they had no serious shortages.",

But the loss of newly planted seedlings means there is likely to be further shortages into January and February, just as Brits seek out salad for their new year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/sep/18/health-without-wealth-eat-well-for-less\">health kick</a>.</p> <p>One wholesaler said some supermarkets were planning to fly in stock from the US and at least one supermarket confirmed it would do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18087831bd96b4eae879047161cc8d86bd9b08a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18087831bd96b4eae879047161cc8d86bd9b08a3/0_199_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flooded streets in the village of Los Alc\u00e1zares in Murcia, Spain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flooded streets in the village of Los Alc\u00e1zares in Murcia, Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marcial Guillen/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese have been among the worst downpours we have seen since these farms were established in the 1980s,\u201d a spokeswoman for the <a href=\"http://www.britishleafysalads.co.uk/\">British Leafy Salads Association</a> told trade journal the Grocer. \u201cThe rainfall has been so intense that the ground is saturated and there is nowhere for the excess water to go.\u201d</p> <p>Andy Weir at <a href=\"https://www.reynolds-cs.com/\">Reynolds</a>, which supplies national restaurant chains including Pizza Express and Carluccio\u2019s, said: \u201cWe have managed to maintain availability as we buy from contracted growers and they have pulled out all the stops. There is a massive shortage in the market and if you don\u2019t have a contract of supply you will struggle.\u201d<br></p> <p>He said difficulty in organising new planting to replace lost seedlings was likely to mean salad supply problems would emerge again in February and March when those crops should be harvested.</p> <p>Some supermarkets including Sainsbury\u2019s and Aldi had signs up warning shoppers they were experiencing salad shortages ahead of Christmas.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sainsbury\u2019s said: \u201cThere has been limited supply of our iceberg and gem lettuce due to weather conditions in Spain but deliveries to stores are now taking place. We are doing all we can to ensure customers can buy the lettuce of their choice for Christmas and Boxing Day.\u201d</p> <p>Aldi said it was experiencing shortages in some areas, but Tesco and Morrisons said they had no serious shortages.</p>",
