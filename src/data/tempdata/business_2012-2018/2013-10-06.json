      "bodyText": "Concerns continue to be raised about the number of female executives at the top of British business after the latest update on progress towards the government's target of a quarter of the seats in the UK's biggest boardrooms being held by women. The business secretary, Vince Cable, said appointing non-executive directors was \"not an end in itself\" as data shows that the main area of progress is in non-executive appointments, with much slower improvement in executive posts. The latest half-yearly report on the target set by Lord Davies for FTSE 100 boards to be 25% female by 2015 shows that the proportion of women has increased to 19%, up from 12.5% when the former banker first reported in February 2011.

      "body": "<p>A new mood of proud nationalism is emerging in economically resurgent Iceland after an out-of-control banking system sank the country into financial meltdown exactly five years ago. Riding this wave of confidence is 38-year-old prime minister, Sigmundur Dav\u00edd Gunnlaugsson, elected in April on populist promises of mortgage relief for every homeowner.</p> <p>Gunnlaugsson earned his spurs in years of outspoken campaigning against the foreign creditors who still haunt Iceland, particularly the British and the Dutch governments, which intervened after the collapse of Landsbanki \u2013 the bank behind Icesave \u2013 on 7 October 2008.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of ordinary British and Dutch savers had previously switched their savings into online Icesave accounts, attracted by market-beating interest rates and promises that: \"You can also rest assured that with Icesave you are offered the same level of financial protection as every bank in the UK.\"</p> <p>When the crash came, however, Iceland's deposit guarantee proved worthless, forcing the UK and the Netherlands to use their own taxpayer funds to compensate ordinary savers and sparking a poisonous diplomatic row.</p> <p>It was a spat that, against the odds, Iceland won. While many other politicians in Iceland had urged a policy of appeasing the enraged British and Dutch governments, Gunnlaugsson had insisted they should go hang. \"Icelanders, as descendants of the Vikings, are highly individualistic and have difficulty putting up with authorities, let alone oppression,\" he said in one of his first speeches as prime minister on Iceland's Independence Day in June this year.</p> <p>\"This was clearly demonstrated in the Icesave dispute, in which the people rejected an agreement they considered unfair. This was later upheld by an international court, which showed that the people's sense of justice was a reliable indicator to follow.\"Having helped win the famous Icesave victory from outside government, Gunnlaugsson has promised to carry that uncompromising approach with him as prime minister, hinting at a new wave of attacks on the interests of foreign creditors to Iceland's three failed banks: Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki. Between them, these institutions had assets more than nine times the size of Iceland's economic output when they failed in 2008.</p> <p>From the wreckage, only three modest domestic banks emerged, allowing Iceland to keep functioning. The country was also able to let its overheated currency devalue, and impose capital controls to bring some stability.</p> <p>Meanwhile, however, international bondholders and depositors were left out in the cold, waiting to recover what scraps they could from the banks' administration processes. Five years on and they are still waiting.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Gunnlaugsson's main pre-election pledges were to squeeze these foreign creditors \u2013 characterised as \"hedge funds\" or \"vulture funds\" \u2013 in order to bankroll a mortgage relief programme for all homeowners and a string of pro-business tax cuts.</p> <p>Political opponents savaged the pledge. \"It was like promising to bring back [the boom of] 2007,\" reflects the Left-Green former finance minister Steingr\u00edmur Sigf\u00fasson. But the Icelandic electorate loved it.</p> <p>And with creditors' interests still locked in slow administration processes, and behind tight capital control walls, Gunnlaugsson believes he has a strong hand to play.</p> <p>During the election campaign this year, he said: \"This does not revolve around the confiscation of assets. The loss has already been incurred. It was mostly borne by foreign creditors who have recognised the loss and got out. In their place came hedge funds that have profited enormously \u2014 on paper \u2014 from the collection now of much that was considered lost and written off \u2026</p> <p>\"It cannot be accepted that Icelanders should slave away to increase such collections and regain that which had already been lost without getting any share in it.\"</p> <p>Creditor groups remain circumspect, keen to get into private discussions with the new administration as quickly as possible. Behind the scenes, however, they are examining their legal options carefully should Gunnlaugsson's aggression go too far. Their goal is to strike a deal that will allow foreign creditors to access more than \u00a39bn of foreign currency assets tied up with the three banks' administrators and barred from exiting Iceland. \"We have been attempting to engage for some time and fail to understand the lack of progress from the authorities,\" said one source close to the creditors.</p> <p>Gunnlaugsson's rise to power shocked some observers outside Iceland, who thought the electorate might give their backing to the Left-Green-led coalition that had taken power iafter the banking crash and steered the country through the strictures of an International Monetary Fund programme, and back to growth.</p> <p>Instead, the Left-Greens suffered the heaviest defeat in Icelandic history after an election campaign dominated not by economic achievements but by the fallout from the Icesave saga.</p> <p>Bouncing back into office came a coalition of the two rightwing parties \u2013 the Independence Party and Gunnlaugsson's Progressive party \u2013 that had been in charge for much of Iceland's discredited boom years between 2003 and 2008. \"The old rascals are back,\" laughs Geir Haarde, former Independence Party leader and prime minister at the time of the crash.</p> <p>The previous government had twice negotiated terms under which Iceland would repay the UK and the Netherlands, with interest, for the cost of bailing out Icesave savers. It was made plain to ministers at the time that continued IMF support depended on such a deal.</p> <p>But both proposals, despite being passed by the Icelandic parliament, were overwhelmingly defeated in public referenda thanks in part Gunnlaugsson. Popular opinion in Iceland had railed against what Gunnlaugsson grass roots campaign group InDefence portrayed as bullying forces from overseas, set on extracting reparations from Reykjavik akin to those sought from Germany in the Treaty of Versailles.</p> <p>InDefence attacked Britain in particular, accusing Gordon Brown's government of deliberately damaging Iceland's standing in international markets in 2008 by using anti-terrorism laws to freeze the UK assets of Landsbanki. The bank, together with Iceland's finance ministry, was even place on a UK list of financially sanctioned regimes alongside North Korea and al-Qaida.</p> <p>As time went on, however, eminent economists began to reassess Iceland's reputation as a pariah state, contrasting it favourably with, among others, Ireland, which had been similarly laid low by an outsized banking sector and forced to seek emergency help from the IMF.</p> <p>\"Where everyone else bailed out the bankers and made the public pay the price, Iceland let the banks go bust and actually expanded its social safety net,\" noted Paul Krugman, admiringly. Iceland, he found, had demonstrated the \"case for letting creditors of private banks gone wild eat the losses\".</p> <p>Nobel prize winner Joeseph Stilitz agreed. \"What Iceland did was right. It would have been wrong to burden future generations with the mistakes of the financial system.\" For Financial Times economist Martin Wolf too, it was a triumph. \"Iceland let the creditors of its banks hang. Ireland did not. Good for Iceland!\" Less good, of course, for the foreign creditors. And Not all of the foreign creditors are the vulture funds Gunnlaugsson talks of. British and Dutch taxpayers still have significant exposure to the Landsbanki administration. As priority creditors they have had almost 55% of their claims repaid, though the remainder will take a good deal longer to be paid out. There are UK local authorities and charities, too, which entrusted more than \u00a31bn with failed Icelandic banks and are still waiting to get much of their money back. Meanwhile, taxpayer-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland had been one of the largest investors in Icelandic bank bonds, a position that has left it a non-priority claimant, expecting only minimal returns in its claims.</p> <p>Until recently RBS had remained on the banks' creditor lists but sold its positions to distressed debt specialists earlier this year \u2014 at a heavy loss \u2014 as the outlook for creditors began to look more uncertain in the face of Gunnlaugsson's rising fortunes.</p> <p>The Icelandic prime minister has promised to give further details of his populist programme for tax cuts and home loan debt relief next month, and will be under pressure to show how he expects to fund such moves. It remains to be seen if he gains more from squeezing foreign creditors trapped within Iceland's capital controls than he loses in terms of the damage to Iceland's reputation among international investors.</p> <p>Last month Gunnlaugsson flew to London to address the Iceland Investment Forum, finishing his speech by declaring: \"Hope to see you, and your money, in Iceland.\"</p> <p>The response, from an audience largely of Icelanders and representatives of the foreign creditors, was a ripple of nervous laughter. Gunnlaugsson will not want that laughter to grow any louder.</p> <h2>Return to riches</h2> <p>Icelanders are fast on their way back to becoming among the richest people in the world, just five years after experiencing one of the most dramatic financial meltdowns in history.</p> <p>\"If you say Iceland was a ship, it [the 2008 banking crash] caused a lot of damage to the bridge, but the body of the ship and the engine were still in good order,\" said Geir Haarde, prime minister at the time. He added: \"Our growth prospects for the future are tremendous.\"</p> <p>Haarde's government was ousted three months after the crash in the face of noisy street demonstrations which became known as the \"pots and pans revolution\". A new Left-Green led coalition pushed the country through the strictures of an IMF bailout programme.</p> <p>\"We raised almost every tax there was \u2013 and introduced new ones,\" recalled the then finance minister, Steingrimur Sigfusson, adding that there were considerable cuts in public spending too as government debt swelled to eye-watering levels.</p> <p>By August 2011, Iceland had graduated from its International Monetary Fund bailout programme with flying colours. \"We became a poster child for them,\" suggests Sigfusson, noting how the fund is still struggling to right many other sinking economies on Europe's peripheries.</p> <p>Weeks after the IMF exit, a conference was held in Reykjavik, where the mood was close to celebratory. \"As the first country to experience the full force of the global economic crisis,\" the IMF said, \"Iceland is now held up as an example by some of how to overcome deep economic dislocation without undoing the social fabric.\"</p> <p>Since then, with government borrowing receding, Iceland has been able to return to the international debt markets, and has begun repaying its emergency loans. Meanwhile, the economy \u2013 having shrunk more than 10% in two years \u2013 bounced in 2011 and 2012, and will grow by about 1.9% this year.</p> <p>Many Icelanders wince at the suggestion that they have escaped lightly from their IMF ordeal. Disposable income fell by a quarter after the crash, and 30,000 people \u2013 one-tenth of the population \u2013 have fallen into serious loan default; thousands of homes have been repossessed.</p> <p>But that is not the whole story. Throughout the crisis, the Icelandic population has maintained the lowest risk of poverty or social exclusion in Europe. Unemployment, which briefly rose to 9.2%, has dropped back to 5.1%. Inflation is falling back to its target range, and house prices in Reykjavik are on the rise. Credit rating agency Fitch gave this assessment of the recovery in February: \"The upgrade reflects the impressive progress Iceland continues to make ... [and] is underpinned by high income-per-capita levels. Rich natural resources, a young population and robust pension assets further support the rating.\"</p> <p>Although Iceland has a small population of 317,000, supporting one of the smallest currencies in the world, its resources are mighty in comparison. One in 84 fish caught around the world is caught by Icelandic trawlers in the nation's rich north Atlantic waters. Meanwhile, glacial meltwater powers the nations hydro power stations and, together with geothermal generators, produce electricity five times the requirements of the local population.</p> <p>Haarde, who has left politics, says: \"We are used to living quite well. Actually we were only set back a few years. Let's leave aside why this happened, and the blame. When the crisis came to Iceland we were fortunate enough to do what was necessary. The banks never closed, people were able to go to their banks and use their credit cards. There were older people who didn't even realize their had been a crisis.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended</p>",

Last month Gunnlaugsson flew to London to address the Iceland Investment Forum, finishing his speech by declaring: \"Hope to see you, and your money, in Iceland.\" The response, from an audience largely of Icelanders and representatives of the foreign creditors, was a ripple of nervous laughter. Gunnlaugsson will not want that laughter to grow any louder. Return to riches Icelanders are fast on their way back to becoming among the richest people in the world, just five years after experiencing one of the most dramatic financial meltdowns in history. \"If you say Iceland was a ship, it [the 2008 banking crash] caused a lot of damage to the bridge, but the body of the ship and the engine were still in good order,\" said Geir Haarde, prime minister at the time. He added: \"Our growth prospects for the future are tremendous.\" Haarde's government was ousted three months after the crash in the face of noisy street demonstrations which became known as the \"pots and pans revolution\". A new Left-Green led coalition pushed the country through the strictures of an IMF bailout programme. \"We raised almost every tax there was \u2013 and introduced new ones,\" recalled the then finance minister, Steingrimur Sigfusson, adding that there were considerable cuts in public spending too as government debt swelled to eye-watering levels. By August 2011, Iceland had graduated from its International Monetary Fund bailout programme with flying colours. \"We became a poster child for them,\" suggests Sigfusson, noting how the fund is still struggling to right many other sinking economies on Europe's peripheries. Weeks after the IMF exit, a conference was held in Reykjavik, where the mood was close to celebratory. \"As the first country to experience the full force of the global economic crisis,\" the IMF said, \"Iceland is now held up as an example by some of how to overcome deep economic dislocation without undoing the social fabric.\" Since then, with government borrowing receding, Iceland has been able to return to the international debt markets, and has begun repaying its emergency loans. Meanwhile, the economy \u2013 having shrunk more than 10% in two years \u2013 bounced in 2011 and 2012, and will grow by about 1.9% this year. Many Icelanders wince at the suggestion that they have escaped lightly from their IMF ordeal. Disposable income fell by a quarter after the crash, and 30,000 people \u2013 one-tenth of the population \u2013 have fallen into serious loan default; thousands of homes have been repossessed. But that is not the whole story. Throughout the crisis, the Icelandic population has maintained the lowest risk of poverty or social exclusion in Europe. Unemployment, which briefly rose to 9.2%, has dropped back to 5.1%. Inflation is falling back to its target range, and house prices in Reykjavik are on the rise. Credit rating agency Fitch gave this assessment of the recovery in February: \"The upgrade reflects the impressive progress Iceland continues to make ... [and] is underpinned by high income-per-capita levels. Rich natural resources, a young population and robust pension assets further support the rating.\" Although Iceland has a small population of 317,000, supporting one of the smallest currencies in the world, its resources are mighty in comparison. One in 84 fish caught around the world is caught by Icelandic trawlers in the nation's rich north Atlantic waters. Meanwhile, glacial meltwater powers the nations hydro power stations and, together with geothermal generators, produce electricity five times the requirements of the local population. Haarde, who has left politics, says: \"We are used to living quite well. Actually we were only set back a few years. Let's leave aside why this happened, and the blame. When the crisis came to Iceland we were fortunate enough to do what was necessary. The banks never closed, people were able to go to their banks and use their credit cards. There were older people who didn't even realize their had been a crisis.\" \u2022 This article was amended",

      "bodyText": "Investors in the Royal Mail selloff stand to generate an instant return of at least 12% on their investment if trading matches current speculation on grey markets, according to City experts. Labour has stepped up demands for the government to pull the plug on the privatisation before applications for shares close on Tuesday evening, warning that taxpayers will be shortchanged in a \"bonanza for City speculators\". The government is set to offer shares at a price of between 260p and 330p, valuing the company at up to \u00a33.3bn. But according to City spread betting firm IG Group, demand from speculators is likely to push share prices to between 370p and 390p when stock market trading opens. David Jones, chief market strategist at IG, which has been running a grey market for retail investors for three weeks, said: \"We started quoting at \u00a32.5bn and it's been pushed up to \u00a33.8bn. Our price is being driven purely by our clients' activity.\" He said that activity suggested prices would rise on the first day of trading to between 370p and 390p \u2013 a 12-18% profit even if the offer price were set at the maximum 330p, adding: \"This looks like an instant windfall to everybody.\" The offer price will be announced on Thursday at 7am. Although it is widely expected now to be at least 300p a share, a host of City analysts say even that will undervalue the Royal Mail, in what is the biggest privatisation since the selloff of the railways in the 1990s. Gert Zonneveld, managing director of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, has said he believes the true value of Royal Mail could prove to be up to \u00a34.5bn, while stockbroker ETX Capital said exceptional demand from retail investors would drive the shares as high as 365p on the first day. Applications for shares close at a minute to midnight on Tuesday evening. Potential investors placed orders covering all the shares on offer within hours of the sale launching last week. Stockbrokers kept offices open through the weekend to field calls from smaller private investors, with the public able to buy shares when investing \u00a3750 upwards. Around 60% of the company will be sold off, with 10% handed to employees and the government retaining at least a 30% shareholding. Institutional investors will be allowed to trade shares conditionally from Friday, while retail shareholders \u2013 ordinary members of the public \u2013 can potentially sell shares as soon as they are listed on the stock market on 15 October. Shares issued to employees are locked in for three years. The shadow business secretary, Chuka Umunna, said: \"It is not too late for the govemnment to pull the plug on this privatisation which appears to be about to deliver a huge bonanza for City speculators at the same time that it is massively shortchanging taxpayers.\" Labour believes that the Royal Mail's property assets alone, including prime central London sites now regarded as surplus to requiremets, could be sold for billions. The Communication Workers Union says the overwhelming majority of postal workers oppose the deal. A ballot for strike action may lead to a walkout later this month. Meanwhile, a Royal Mail spokesman said that reports that the newly privatised firm would pay no corporation tax for a decade were \"entirely speculative\".",

      "bodyText": "October 1973. England versus Poland at Wembley. Only a win would ensure England's participation in the World Cup finals. The 1-1 draw on that misty autumn evening signalled the end of Alf Ramsey's reign as England manager. It took place against the backdrop of a war in the Middle East that marked the end of postwar abundance. The war began on 6 October 1973 when Israel was celebrating the holy day of Yom Kippur and was over by the end of the month, with initial gains by the coalition of Arab states quickly reversed. The oil cartel Opec announced supply restrictions leading to energy shortages in the US. In Britain, the Yom Kippur war added to the problems of a Conservative government trying to control an already overheating economy with a prices and incomes policy. By Christmas, Britain was preparing for a three-day week. The Yom Kippur war lasted less than a month but its effects lasted four decades. It marked the end of a certain way of looking at the world, namely that the problems of production had been resolved and that policymaking was about how the fruits of growth were shared between capital and labour, between private and public sectors, and between consumption and investment. In truth, there had been signs of problems well before the autumn of 1973. One critique came from the fledgling environmental movement, which said the fixation on growth was dangerous. The bible of the movement, Small is Beautiful by Fritz Schumacher, was published in 1973. The other critique was from those who said the golden age was something of a historical aberration made possible by the massive scope for expansion from the output losses in the second world war. Free-marketeers argued that higher spending on welfare, excessive pay awards demanded by organised labour and punitive taxes were stifling capitalism. This critique was provided with real traction by the oil crisis of 1973. Cheap crude had been a key factor in the long boom and the Opec embargo increased oil prices fourfold by the end of the year. Dearer energy pushed up business costs and reduced the disposable incomes of workers. Simultaneously inflationary and deflationary, it resulted in a new word entering the lexicon of economics: stagflation. Initially, there were attempts by politicians of the centre right and centre left to keep the show on the road. This group \u2013 Jim Callaghan in Britain, Helmut Schmidt in Germany, Gerald Ford in the US, Val\u00e9ry Giscard D'Estaing in France \u2013 had come of age as statesmen in the good years but developed a more muscular approach to economic management as a result of the oil shock. Callaghan's repudiation of Keynesianism and the shift at the Treasury to an early form of monetarism were examples of the new mood. This, though, proved to be a staging post \u2013 in the US and Britain at least \u2013 to a wholly different way of looking at the world. Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in America believed in market forces, financial deregulation, lower taxes, weak trade unions and less intrusive government. Yet the results of this revolution have been distinctly mixed. Not only has growth been slower than it was in the so-called golden age, it has been less evenly distributed. Boom and bust has been a feature of the past four decades in a way that it wasn't in the quarter century from 1948 to 1973. And while the assault on trade unions certainly weakened the power of organised labour, the upshot has been that workers have struggled to secure as big a share of growth as they did in the 1950s and 1960s. Consumption patterns have become more dependent on easy credit from deregulated finance generating higher asset prices. Until the recent crisis, this ensured that there was no repeat of the falling living standards seen in the mid to late 1970s. Nor is it entirely obvious that market forces reign supreme or that government has become less intrusive. It is perhaps more accurate to say that public sector monopolies have been replaced by private sector oligopolies that can fix prices and rock the consumer. And while the government no longer owns a large chunk of British industry, it has found other ways to be intrusive. The surveillance state is alive and well. In his new book, the investment banker Daniel Alpert says the world is suffering from oversupply. This has been generated from the biggest change of all in the past 40 years: the spread of the market economy to all corners of the globe; to China, to India and to the former Soviet Union. The world economy has more than enough labour, productive capacity and capital to meet current levels of demand. The result has been downward pressure on wages in developed countries and financial bubbles caused by the huge current account surpluses of developing countries being recycled through western financial markets. Alpert argues that unlike in the aftermath of the second world war there were no new institutions developed to manage a changing global economy, nothing to resemble the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Nor has there been any significant change in economic thinking. The crisis of 2008-09 demonstrated the deficiencies of the model that emerged from the wreckage of the golden age in the 1970s. In 1973, the symptoms of trouble were falling profitability, industrial unrest and a rising cost of living. Today they are falling real wages, excessively high levels of debt and a dysfunctional financial system. Policymakers have been struggling for five years to put the show back on the road. There is a growing sense of public unease that things are not as they should be, although there has been no swing to the left in the way that there was a swing to the right four decades ago. The half decade since the collapse of Lehman Brothers has been chastening for those who imagined the near-collapse of the world's financial system would lead to a seismic shift in the political landscape. In part, that's because support for the status quo is stronger than it was in 1973, since those at the top of the pile have most to lose from change. In part, it's because there was an ideological vacuum when the financial markets crashed. So instead of a fundamental rethink of how to manage the age of oversupply, the approach is to assume nothing fundamental is wrong and that given time and a bit of luck the good times will return. Pretty much what every England manager since Alf Ramsey has said, in fact. \u2022 The Age of Oversupply by Daniel Alpert; Penguin, \u00a314.99",
