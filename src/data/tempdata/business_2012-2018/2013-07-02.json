      "bodyText": "Tesco has poached a senior executive from the National Farmers' Union as it attempts to restore public trust following the horsemeat scandal. The move comes as a survey reveals that British consumers remain highly sceptical about the safety of food products. Britain's largest retailer has appointed Tom Hind, corporate affairs director at the NFU, as director of agriculture in a new role designed to improve Tesco's relationship with farmers and suppliers. The appointment follows a pledge by Tesco chief executive, Philip Clarke, at the NFU's annual conference this year to build stronger relationships with farmers and introduce a more transparent supply chain. Tesco's UK sales have been hit by the horsemeat scandal, when horse DNA was found in four Tesco products including beef burgers. Other food retailers implicated in the furore included Lidl, Aldi and Iceland. Hind helped create the voluntary code of practice for the dairy industry while at the NFU and has led NFU lobbying efforts on the new groceries code adjudicator, who is able to ifine supermarkets if they do not treat suppliers fairly. In his new role, Hind will be the main point of contact between Tesco's commercial teams and farmers across the UK. Christine Tacon, the adjudicator, has said she is inclined to fine retailers a proportion of their turnover if they mistreat suppliers. Kevin Grace, Tesco commercial director, said: \"Tom is a respected figure in British agriculture and will bring with him a huge amount of hands-on farming experience.

Meanwhile, research by Mintel shows that consumer confidence in the UK food industry has been seriously dented by the horsemeat scandal. Six months since the crisis erupted, its survey found that just half of respondents trust the food industry to provide safe food to eat, with almost two fifths undecided. Only 42% of consumers, taken from a nationally representative sample of 2,000 adults, believe the food industry can react to major food scares effectively, while less than a quarter believe that different elements of the supply chain work effectively together. Consumer concerns about food safety centre on the complexity and lack of transparency around supply chains, reflecting a scandal that started in Ireland but soon raised concerns about the sourcing of meat across Europe. Just 36% of consumers feel that food manufacturers are aware of where their ingredients come from, according to Mintel.

      "bodyText": "The Kurdish oil minister who allegedly received inside information from the former JP Morgan banker Ian Hannam later instructed brokers to buy up to $21m (\u00a313.9m) of shares in Hannam's client Heritage Oil, a tribunal has heard. Details of the order were disclosed in papers that form part of the Financial Conduct Authority's defence of its decision to fine Hannam \u00a3450,000 for disclosing inside information about Heritage in 2008. The banker, who stepped down from JP Morgan after the fine, began an appeal against the fine at a tribunal in London on Tuesday. In explanation of the fine, the FCA, then part of the Financial Services Authority, said: \"It is not suggested that any trades were conducted on the basis of the information disclosed by Mr Hannam.\" The latest court papers, filed by the FCA, say: \"The FSA did not consider that it had evidence that the purchase [on the instruction of Ashti Hawrami] was made on the basis of the information Mr Hannam provided to him.\" Hawrami explained in a statement that the instruction to brokers at HSBC, on 16 October 2008, had been to purchase shares in a basket of oil companies in order to provide a hedge against investment in the troubled Norwegian exploration group DNO, which had interests in Kurdish northern Iraq. \"Nothing was going on with any of these companies that could have been considered as my having private knowledge as far as I was aware, and no rules were to be broken,\" he said. Filings with the tribunal show that JP Morgan instigated its own internal investigation in parallel to FSA actions, which concluded that Hannam had \"conducted business communications with third parties in a manner falling below the standards expected of you\". Internal disciplinary action required that he resign from the board of JP Morgan Chase; not initiate new business relationships; not act as nominated adviser to any listed company; and that he must have his mobile phone and emails monitored. The case against Hannam focuses on two emails sent to Hawrami in September and October 2008, which regulators claim contain insider information in relation to the activities of Heritage in Uganda, which were being closely watched by the markets. On 9 September, Hannam emailed the Kurdish regional government minister telling him that discussions were taking place between \"Tony Buckingham's business\" [a reference to the Heritage chief executive] and an unnamed potential bidder.

      "bodyText": "City regulators have brushed aside complaints by Barclays and Nationwide over tough new liquidity rules, saying UK banks would need to put them into effect as soon as possible, years ahead of an international deadline of 2018. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Paul Tucker, responsible for financial stability, said lobbying against the change by the banks was \"completely unacceptable\", and regulators would not be deflected \"one iota\" from the task. He told MPs the rules should be introduced before the end of the year to curb the risk exposure of Britain's highly leveraged banks. Barclays and Nationwide complained vociferously against the \"shock\" decision by regulators last month to fast-track the new rules, which they said would harm their finances and ability to lend. At a meeting last week Mervyn King, the former Bank of England governor, told MPs that large banks' executives had lobbied the Treasury and No 10 to block the rule changes before 2015. Barclays hinted that it could restrict lending to households and businesses if the rules were to bite this year. The row comes as US regulators on Tuesday made clear they intended to push ahead with the new rules on bank borrowing levels and higher reserves ahead of deadlines established by the Bank for International Settlements. Much to the annoyance of the head of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, and of highly leveraged banks such as Wells Fargo, Dan Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor in charge of regulation, promised a stricter lending ratio, tying the amount banks can lend to the equity held by shareholders. He said the reserve was close to putting forward a plan that would place a tougher cap on leverage for US banks. \"The Basel III leverage ratio seems to have been set too low to be an effective counterpart to the combination of risk-weighted capital measures that have been agreed internationally,\" he said. Banks have complained vociferously that regulators are demanding they move more quickly to safer levels of capital and lending. The Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who heads the Treasury select committee, said he was concerned that the banks were throwing their weight around. Andrew Bailey, who heads the Prudential Regulation Authority, which will monitor banks and insurers, confirmed that George Osborne was approached by several banks over the new rules, but that the PRA's independence was confirmed by the chancellor. \"We are certainly aware that there are conversations that happened between the banks and officials and ministers,\" he said. \"The thing that concerns me is that we are trying to build, frankly, a transparent process that has accountability in it.\" Martin Taylor, a former Barclays chief and an external member of the financial policy committee, which will guard the financial system from a repeat of the 2008 crash, said: \"The reason the banks are squawking is that the PRA and Andrew Bailey are doing their job, and you might say about time too.\" Bailey said that banks were behind schedule in cleaning up their balance sheets after suffering extra costs from the payment protection insurance scandal and the euro crisis last year. He said he wanted the rule in place as soon as possible and that regulatory staff were looking at banks' plans for how they could implement it. \"We have made clear that we will go through these with the public, with the institutions during the course of this month. And we will publish. We will make clear what the outcome of that is,\" Bailey told MPs. The PRA said on 20 June that it would set a leverage ratio of 3% for UK banks, which would limit the amount they could lend relative to their capital. Barclays has a leverage ratio of 2.5% after adjustments, while the Nationwide could only manage a 2% ratio. Tyrie said: \"FPC members today made clear that they feel a 3% leverage ratio is an appropriate minimum backstop and that the FPC can make recommendations in this area, even without an explicit power of direction. Bank lobbying of government only serves to reinforce the need for the power to set the leverage ratio to lie with the independent FPC, not the Treasury.\" Lloyds is expected to split 600 branches into a separate business next year to increase competition in the banking sector following an attempt to sell the new business to the Co-op, which fell through. The MP Jesse Norman asked Bailey why the Co-op's reported \"lack of reserves\" came as a surprise in December 2012 to Lloyds, when regulators were supposed to be aware of shortfalls. Bailey said regulators discovered in 2011 that the Co-op was suffering from poor leadership and governance, coupled with a shortage of capital and liquidity. He said the Co-op was made aware of its concerns and he understood that Lloyds was informed. The collapse of the deal proved an embarrassment to the Treasury, which had trumpeted it as part of wider reforms of the banking sector to make it more competitive. Tyrie said there was a discrepancy between the testimony of Lloyds chiefs and the regulator. \"The chairman of Lloyds, Sir Win Bischoff, told the Treasury committee that Lloyds became aware of a potential capital shortfall at the Co-operative Group in December 2012. Andrew Bailey today said that he told the Co-op's board that it should inform Lloyds of the regulator's concerns, including over its capital levels, more than a year beforehand. \"[Bailey] also told us he has evidence to suggest his requests were complied with. The Treasury committee will want to look at whether the regulator's message got through, how it was conveyed and what, if any, action was taken.\"",

On the timing front, the PRA has at least made clear when it expects 3% to be achieved \u2013 there is \"a presumption that we do want this to happen as soon as possible\", said the executive director, Andrew Bailey.

Barclays, if it had thought more carefully about capital and leverage, could have made deeper cuts to its bonus pool in recent years, rather than embarking on a \"journey\" of pay reforms that looks more like a crawl.</p> <p>On the timing front, the PRA has at least made clear when it expects 3% to be achieved \u2013 there is \"a presumption that we do want this to happen as soon as possible\", said the executive director, Andrew Bailey. The vague wording leaves some room for negotiation, but the message to Jenkins seems clear: don't argue with the referee. Sound advice.</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Tim Steiner, the boss of online grocer Ocado, has launched an attack on high street retailers who are asking the government to review business rates, saying more traditional shops needed to close and telling rivals to stop complaining. Steiner, who recently announced a deal with Morrisons to launch the supermarket's online service, said: \"Bricks and mortar retailers need to shut more shops and stop moaning about it.\" He added that online-only retailers should not be forced to share the burden of business rates, which currently only apply to shops on the high street. He said: \"Some bricks and mortar retailers have started to blame business rates for the problems on the high street, which is wrong. They are jumping on the back of the Amazon tax debate. \"It is nothing to do with online retail that is causing the problems in the UK and we shouldn't burden online retailers.\" By contrast, Alliance Boots retail chief executive Alex Gourlay told MPs on Tuesday that a refusal to cut business rates could lead to a further rise in youth unemployment. Gourlay, who is in charge of the UK high street retailer Boots, told the business select committee: \"The fundamental facts are ... the indirect taxation levied on retailers in the last ten years is now causing significant structural problems on the high street. \"I think there is potentially a risk to the 40% of people that join retail as their first job, which is as the shift towards integrated retail happens, and as there is less physical retailing and more online and supply chain retailing, less people are employed in the sector, and that's a risk. \"The next phase could be reduction of space in retail as a whole and a reduction of actual jobs on the shop floor. I think that's a risk given the level of employment that is given to young people by retail and what they get from it.\" The retail sector is the biggest private-sector employer for young people. However, a series of administrations in the last year, including Blockbuster, HMV, Jessops and Comet, has meant tens of thousands young workers lost their jobs. Last week Terry Duddy, the chief executive of Home Retail Group, owner of Argos and Homebase, warned it was not online competition that caused Jessops to go bust. He blamed business rates, which he called \"ludicrous\". Sainsbury's chief executive, Justin King, has suggested there should be a local online sales tax similar to that being introduced in the US \u2013 a position supported on Tuesday by Tim Fallowfield, the grocer's company secretary, as he appeared before MPs. Fallowfield said: \"In the United States they have issued a main-street fairness tax which is redistributing the tax burden by applying a local sales tax, which would apply equally to bricks and mortar retail as well as online retail.\" Last month King said online retailers have an unfair advantage and that for every \u00a31 his company has saved in corporation tax, it has paid \u00a32.50 in extra business rates. Steiner appeared indifferent to the complaints from the high street retailers and said his company already pays significant tax. He said: \"We use vehicles and fuel, and the majority of the diesel we pay for has tax and VAT. We employ over 6,000 people in the UK and make substantial national insurance contributions in the UK and pay business rates on our warehouses. \"Trying to tax [online fashion retailers] Asos or Pret-a-Porter for their success would be foolish.\" The comments come as Ocado revealed a pre-tax loss of \u00a33.8m in the six months to 19 May, compared with a \u00a30.2m profit a year earlier. Steiner said the loss was the result of advisers' fees linked to the Morrisons deal and pre-opening costs of the new distribution centre. Revenue rose nearly 16%% to \u00a3356m, while customer numbers increased to 360,000 from 337,000 at the end of the first half last year. Shares closed down 3.2p and 309p, although they are up 316% on a year ago following the tie-up with Morrisons. Business rates are charged on buildings used as business premises and based on a valuation of the property. The fees go to local authorities in the same way as council tax does for domestic properties. The rates are non-negotiable although charity shops are exempt, which has led to landlords being keen to fill empty shops with charity tenants to avoid paying rates on an empty building. Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, which monitors footfall and vacancy rates on the high street, warned that without flexibility, town centres run the risk of deteriorating. She said: \"What you get is a spiral of decline, especially in smaller towns. When a big chain goes bust you get large, empty stores in town centres, but because the overheads are so huge, very few retailers want to take that on. So, customers then leave, making the remaining stores suffer, causing a spiral.\"",

First, two democratically elected governments have steadfastly implemented the agreed austerity programmes with little need for waivers and modifications \u2013 and thus without the associated political drama. Second, despite enduring considerable pain, Irish society has stuck with the programme, staging few of the street protests that have been common in other austerity-hit countries.</p> <p>All of this puts Ireland in the middle of three important issues raised in the austerity debates: whether orthodox policy, with its heavy emphasis on immediate budget cuts, can restore conditions for growth, employment gains, and financial stability; whether the benefits of eurozone membership still outweigh the costs for countries that must restructure their economies; and how a small, open economy should strategically position itself in today's world.</p> <p>Austerity's supporters point to the fact that Ireland is on the verge of \"graduating\" from the troika's programme. Growth has resumed, financial-risk premia have fallen sharply, foreign investment is picking up, and exports are booming. All of this, they argue, provides the basis for sustainable growth and declining unemployment. Ireland, they conclude, was right to stay in the eurozone, especially because small, open economies that are unanchored can be easily buffeted by a fluid global economy.</p> <p>\"Not so fast,\" says the other side. The critics of austerity point to the fact that Irish GDP has still not returned to its 2007 level. Unemployment remains far too high, with alarming levels of long-term and youth joblessness. Public debt remains too high as well, and, making matters worse, much more of it is now owed to official rather than private creditors (which would complicate debt restructuring should it become necessary).</p> <p>The critics reject the argument that small, open economies are necessarily better off in a monetary union, pointing to how well Switzerland is coping. And they lament that eurozone membership means that Ireland's \"internal devaluations,\" which involve significant cuts in real wages, have not yet run their course.</p> <p>The data on the \"Irish experiment\" \u2013 including the lack of solid counterfactuals \u2013 are not conclusive enough for one side to declare a decisive victory. Yet there is some good analytical news. Ireland provides insights that are helpful in understanding how sociopolitical systems, including economically devastated countries such as Cyprus and Greece, have coped so far with shocks that were essentially unthinkable just a few years ago.</p> <p>On my current visit, most of the Irish citizens with whom I have spoken say that the country had no alternative but to follow the path of austerity. While they appreciate the urgent need for growth and jobs, they believe that this can be achieved only after Ireland's finances are put back on a sound footing. They also argue that, given the banks' irresponsibility, there is no quick way to promote sustained expansion. They are still angry at bankers, but have yet to gain proper retribution.</p> <p>Ireland's accumulation of wealth during its Celtic Tiger period, when the country surged toward the top of Europe's economic league table, has also been an effective shock absorber. This, together with fears about being left out in the geopolitical cold (despite the country's historical links with Britain and America), dampens Irish enthusiasm for economic experiments outside the eurozone.</p> <p>Indeed, Irish society seems remarkably hesitant to change course. Right or wrong, Ireland will stick with austerity. Efforts to regain national control of the country's destiny, the Irish seem to believe, must take time. In some of Europe's other struggling countries, however, citizens may well prove less patient.</p> <p>\u00a9 <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/\" title=\"\">Project Syndicate</a> 1995\u20132013</p>",

All of this, they argue, provides the basis for sustainable growth and declining unemployment. Ireland, they conclude, was right to stay in the eurozone, especially because small, open economies that are unanchored can be easily buffeted by a fluid global economy. \"Not so fast,\" says the other side. The critics of austerity point to the fact that Irish GDP has still not returned to its 2007 level. Unemployment remains far too high, with alarming levels of long-term and youth joblessness. Public debt remains too high as well, and, making matters worse, much more of it is now owed to official rather than private creditors (which would complicate debt restructuring should it become necessary). The critics reject the argument that small, open economies are necessarily better off in a monetary union, pointing to how well Switzerland is coping. And they lament that eurozone membership means that Ireland's \"internal devaluations,\" which involve significant cuts in real wages, have not yet run their course. The data on the \"Irish experiment\" \u2013 including the lack of solid counterfactuals \u2013 are not conclusive enough for one side to declare a decisive victory. Yet there is some good analytical news. Ireland provides insights that are helpful in understanding how sociopolitical systems, including economically devastated countries such as Cyprus and Greece, have coped so far with shocks that were essentially unthinkable just a few years ago. On my current visit, most of the Irish citizens with whom I have spoken say that the country had no alternative but to follow the path of austerity. While they appreciate the urgent need for growth and jobs, they believe that this can be achieved only after Ireland's finances are put back on a sound footing. They also argue that, given the banks' irresponsibility, there is no quick way to promote sustained expansion. They are still angry at bankers, but have yet to gain proper retribution. Ireland's accumulation of wealth during its Celtic Tiger period, when the country surged toward the top of Europe's economic league table, has also been an effective shock absorber. This, together with fears about being left out in the geopolitical cold (despite the country's historical links with Britain and America), dampens Irish enthusiasm for economic experiments outside the eurozone. Indeed, Irish society seems remarkably hesitant to change course. Right or wrong, Ireland will stick with austerity. Efforts to regain national control of the country's destiny, the Irish seem to believe, must take time. In some of Europe's other struggling countries, however, citizens may well prove less patient. \u00a9 Project Syndicate 1995\u20132013",

      "bodyText": "More on Portugal: And on that note, we'll close up for the evening. Back tomorrow for the fallout from the latest Portuguese news and all the other developments in the global economy. Thanks for all your comments, and see you soon. Just a quick round-up of the markets, which have generally edged lower again after Monday's gains: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished down 3.84 points at 6303.94 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.92% to 7910 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.66% lower at 3742 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB ended down 0.61% at 15,365 \u2022 Spain's Ibex fell 0.26% to 7886 \u2022 In Athens the market lost 3.24% to 823 Meanwhile Wall Street is bucking the trend with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 32 points or 0.22%. It's a crisis in Porgual all right, says Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy: The resignation of two senior ministers in Portugal's ruling coalition in the space of 24 hours turns a major political setback into a full-blown government crisis. This is the clearest indication yet that the rapidly souring politics of economic reform in Portugal are undermining the credibility of the country's bail-out programme. Politically speaking, Portugal's adjustment programme is collapsing. While the market reaction to former finance minister Gaspar's resignation yesterday was fairly muted, the exit of Mr Portas, the head of the junior coalition party, is taking its toll on Portugal's bond market. Make no mistake about it, this is the gravest setback to Portugal's two-year-old bail-out programme - and there have been quite a few of them over the past several months, including legal ones. The back-to-back resignations throw the political opposition to reform in Portugal into sharp relief and pose serious questions about the country's ability to push ahead, let alone exit, its troubled bail-out programme. The full statement from Paulo Portas on his resignation as Portugal's foreign minister can be found here (in Portuguese). A flavour in (sort of) translation: There are known political differences I had with the Minister of Finance. His personal decision to leave allowed the opportunity for a different economic and political cycle. A choice made by the Prime Minister would therefore be especially careful and consensual\" The Prime Minister intended to follow the path of mere continuity in the Ministry of Finance. I respected it but disagreed. The Portuguese president's office has confirmed the resignation of foreign minister Paulo Portas, potentially plunging the country into crisis as it struggles to meet the terms of its \u20ac78bn bailout and prompting talk of a possible early election. The resignation comes just a day after finance minister Vitor Gaspar quit, but looks more serious. Portas is the leader of the junior party in the country's centre-right coalition government - without the support of his CDS-PP party, the government would lose its majority in parliament. Portas has often been at odds with prime minister Pedro Passos Coelho and Gaspar over the austerity programme brought in as part of the bailout agreement. Ironically, according to local reports, Gaspar's resignation was the trigger for the departure of Portas, since the CDS-PP leader disagreed with the appointment of Maria Luis Albuquerque as the replacement finance minister. Still with Portugal, there are now (unconfirmed) reports the country's foreign minister has resigned. This follows the departure of finance minister Vitor Gaspar yesterday. Portugal's change of finance minister following the resignation of Vitor Gaspar continues to put the country's bonds under pressure. The country's 10 year bond yields have added 12 basis points to 6.52% following the news, but unusually the contamination to the other struggling eurozone economies has been limited. Spain's bond yield is down 3 basis points while Italy is 6 basis points lower. Good for them, not so much for Portugal. It would hardly surprising if the euro was out of favour internationally because of the eurozone crisis (the clue is in the name) but now it's official. The euro slipped last year in terms of reserves held by central banks, according to the European Central Bank, while the US dollar continued to hold its positon as the world's leading currency. The ECB said the euro's share among the currency reserves held globally by central banks fell to 23.9% in 2012 from 25.1% the year before. AP reports: The ECB said the financial crisis that has afflicted the 17-country eurozone was a factor discouraging use of the euro for reserves (no kidding), which are often held in the form of government bonds. Lending across borders in the eurozone has dropped, diminishing the liquidity that reserve holders like to see. Lower liquidity means there are fewer buyers and sellers readily found. In its annual report on international use of the euro, the ECB also found that there was less borrowing in euros internationally by companies because they could get lower interest rates by selling bonds denominated in US. dollars. A key finding of the report was that non-traditional reserve currencies such as the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar are in greater demand because of their growing economies and better public finances. Another slice of economic news.... US factory orders rose by 2.1% in May, month-on-month. That's a little higher with forecasts. April's data has also been revised up to +1.3%, from +1.0%. All broadly in line with the theory that America's economy is recovering, and there's little market reaction. And on that note, I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. The financial markets are pretty quiet, with some traders sitting tight ahead of US unemployment data due on Friday, and the The US and UK stock markets are flattish, while European indices are down, led by the DAX (hit by Fresenius Medical AG, down 8% after warning that the US government is cutting Medicare funding for its kidney dialysis centre). The euro has dropped below the $1.30 mark, while the yen has weakened below \u00a5100, as the US dollar rallies. With Wall Street open, here's the latest prices: \u2022 FTSE 100: flat at 6307 \u2022 Dow Jones; up 40 points at 15014, 15021, +0.3% \u2022 German DAX: down 79 points at 7095,-1% \u2022 French CAC: down 22 points at 3745, -0.6% \u2022 Spanish IBEX: down 2 points at 7904, - 0.04% \u2022 Italian FTSE MIB: down 86 points at 15371, -0.57% * - Having said that, the Indian central bank is rumoured to be urging traders to stop speculating on the rupee, which is close to its record low levels: Unfortunate mea culpa from Eurostat today. Europe's statistics body has admitted that the eurozone jobless rate is in fact a record high of 12.2%, not 12.1% as reported yesterday. The reason? \"An error in the loading of the French data\". Sacre Bleu! Here's the updated release. A group of Greek state school teachers have held a protest outside the ministery of administrative reform in Athens today. The demonstration coincided with the latest meetings between Troika officials and Greek ministers, and was designed to show public anger over the country's financial programme. In particular, the job losses and spending cuts being demanded by the Troika. Riot police were out in force as teachers chanted slogans and waved banners, but the protests appear to be peaceful (no one had to stay behind after class, anyway...) Greece's health minister Adonis Georgiadis has told local reporters in Athens following his meeting with the troika that the two sides reached \u201ctotal agreement.\u201d It's not clear what they've agreed to, though, as EKathimerini reports: \u201c[The ministry] raised the issue that there can be no further cuts in health spending,\u201d Georgiadis said adding however that more reforms were on the way. Back to Greece, and the deputy chief executive at its bank rescue fund has reportedly resigned. Reuters says that deputy CEO Marios Koliopoulos quit the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, in a row over legal procedures. HFSF's role is to recapitalize Greece's major banks, and help wind down the ones that aren't seen as viable. Full story here. Elsewhere in parliament, economist Vicky Pryce called for decisive action, including a bond-buying programme from the European Central Bank, when she appeared at a House of Lords committee today. It was an early public appearance from Pryce since she was released from prison following her conviction after taking speeding points for her ex-husband, the former cabinet minister Chris Huhne. As she entered the meeting, Pryce told waiting reporters that she was \"feeling just fine\", before being ushered into room 3 on the Palace of Westminster's select committee corridor. The electronic tag she is still obliged to wear after being released from prison two months into an eight-month sentence was not visible beneath her outfit. There was no mention of her prison experiences at the hearing of the cross-party subcommittee on economic and financial affairs \u2013 where Pryce said she could not see an immediate end to the crisis afflicting the single currency. Structural reforms would take far too long, she said, advocating \"decisive action\" to tackle debt levels and a stimulus package including the European Central Bank being allowed to buy bonds. More here: Vicky Pryce returns to public eye with House of Lords committee appearance David Cameron's statement on the EU council meeting, and the subsequent questions and answers, are being streamed live now here. So far, Cameron has attacked the \"unacceptable and frustrating\" attempt to unpick Britain's rebate, which would have cost Britain \u00a31.5bn but was rejected. Labour leader Ed Miliband had some fun teasing the PM over his \"flowery\" comments that in Brussels you need to be ready for an ambush, so it's essential to \"lock and load and have one up the spout\" Miliband joked: It sounds more \"Carry On Up The Council\" than \"High Noon\". Cameron, though, responds that every other country at the European Council wants to get rid of Britain's rebate (and other top eurocrats too), and he's determined to defend it. (do follow Andrew Sparrow's rolling blog for full coverage) David Cameron is giving a statement to the UK parliament now on last week's EU Summit -- where he apparently rejected an attack on the British rebate. He's also discussing the situation in Afghanistan. My colleague Andrew Sparrow is liveblogging the whole statement here. I'll keep an ear pointed at Westminster for any eurozone-related points... Encouraging economic news in the UK this morning, with the construction sector posting its fastest growth in over a year in June. Here's the details: UK construction sector grows for second consecutive month The UK's construction sector grew for a second month in June, boosted by a rise in house building and supporting expectations that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter. Growth in both output and new orders pushed the Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) to 51 from 50.8 in May, where anything above 50 indicates expansion. It was the highest level since May 2012. Heads-up. Hannes Swoboda, head of the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, is will be holding a Facebook chat in an hour's time (2pm CET/1pm BST) with David Gow, our former European business editor, on the eurozone crisis. it's on the back of their new book \u2013 Basta! An End to Austerity \u2013 on the mistakes made since the crisis began, and how politicians should change course, The European Commission is denying that Greece has been set a firm, three-day deadline to reach an agreement with the troika over its bailout plan. An EC spokesperson tried to calm the situation, saying that reports of Athens being given until Friday to satisfy its lenders is \"something from nothing\". This follows Reuters' report that four eurozone officials believe time is running out for Athens (see 8.57am for the story) Nikos Chrysoloras, Kathimerini's man in Brussels, adds: The EC added that eurozone finance ministers will consider whether to pay Greece's next aid tranche \u2013 whether all in one part, or in stages \u2013 on Monday. So, even if there isn't anything as gripping as a three-day deadline, pressure is building to make progress by the start of next week. And as Peter Spiegel of the FT flags up, there's a risk that the International Monetary Fund could walk away from Greece if the funding shortfalls in its financial programme aren't fixed by the end of July (full stort here) Portuguese government debt has fallen in value this morning as investors digest the resignation of finance minister Vitor Gaspar. Gaspar, who played a key role in drawing up and implementing Portugal's unpopular austerity programme, quit last night - blaming shrinking public support for the plan. Analysts say Gaspar's resignation is a blow to the Lisbon government. Nicholas Spiro, managing director at Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, warned: Portugal's economic overhaul has suffered a number of setbacks of late, and Mr. Gaspar's unexpected exit hardly inspires confidence. Gaspar's resignation letter to Portuguese PM Pedro Passos-Coelho (online here, in Portuguese). showed that he had been considering his position for months, and may have lost faith in his own austerity programme (he writes that his departure should strenthen the prime minister's \"leadership and the cohesion of the cabinet\"). Open Europe points out that Portugal still faces significant challenges in exiting its bailout. It writes: Domestic demand, government spending and investment are contracting sharply, leaving the country heavily reliant on uncertain export growth to drive the economy. By cutting wages and costs at home (internal devaluation), Portugal has in recent years improved its level of competitiveness in the eurozone relative to Germany. However, this trend actually started to reverse sharply in 2012, meaning that the divergence between countries such as Portugal and Germany has begun growing again \u2013 exactly the sort of imbalance the eurozone is seeking to close. In its austerity efforts, Portugal is now coming up against serious political and constitutional limits. For the second time, the country\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against public sector wage cuts \u2013 a key plank in the country\u2019s EU-mandated austerity plan \u2013 while the previous political consensus in the parliament for austerity has evaporated. Gaspar's successor, Maria Luis Albuquerque, will be inaugurated at 5pm today. As Treasury secretary, she's handled Portugal's privatisation programme. And in the bond markets, Portuguese 10-year bonds are now trading at a yield of 6.49%. That's 10 basis points, or 0.1% higher, than last night, and closer to the 7% mark that's generally seen as unsustainable. Spanish and Italian debt has strengthened a little this morning (with 10-year yields of 4.5% and 4.4%). From Cyprus, crisis-watcher Yiannis Mouzakis flags up that Greece wouldn't be facing a budget shortfall if central banks had agreed to share the pain and rolled over their holdings of Geek debts last year. And here's more early reaction to the news that the clock is once again ticking for Greece (see 8.57am). With pressure building on Greece to satisfy the Troika's demands by the end of the week, top officials have now arrived at the Greek labour ministry. They'll be meeting with labour minister Yiannis Vroutsis today, who (as mantioned ealier) had already said that Greece's minimum wage can't be cut again. And here's Reuters full story on Greece, and the warning from EU officials that time is short.... Greece has three days to reassure its lenders it can deliver on conditions attached to its international bailout in order to receive the next tranche of aid, four euro zone officials said on Tuesday. Athens and its creditors unlocking \u20ac8.1bn of rescue loans resumed talks on Monday on after a two-week break during which the government almost collapsed over redundancies at state broadcaster ERT. There is a general dissatisfaction with progress in Greece when it comes to reforming its public sector, such as tax and custom collection or health care services, a senior euro zone official involved in negotiations said. \"All agreed that Greece has to deliver before the Eurogroup on Monday. That's why they must present again on Friday,\" a second source told Reuters. This adds fuel to the theory that the \u20ac8bn tranche could be split into a few parts, and only handed over when Athens hits certain targets. No wonder government officials have been telling us that negotiations will be \"very tough\". EU officials are reiterating the point that Greece needs to satisfy the Troika in time for next Monday's meeting of the eurogroup (eurozone finance ministers) Via the Reuters terminal: \u2022 GREECE HAS THREE DAYS TO REASSURE LENDERS IT CAN DELIVER ON BAILOUT PLEDGES IN ORDER TO RECEIVE NEXT AID TRANCHE - EU OFFICIALS \u2022 EURO ZONE FINANCE MINISTERS TO DEBATE GREECE AND DECIDE ON FURTHER ACTION ON JULY 8 - EU OFFICIALS In the financial world, Australia's central bank proved that you can talk down your currency without actually easing monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of Australia held interest rates at their current record low of 2.75% overnight, as expected. But the Australian dollar dropped half a cent against its US dollar, not far from a three-year-low, after the RBA hinted at future cuts. Governor Glenn Stevens said the RBA: .. decided that the stance of monetary policy remained appropriate for the time being. The Board also judged that the inflation outlook, as currently assessed, may provide some scope for further easing, should that be required to support demand. Another sign that central bankers believe we're some way from the end of the financial crisis that began over five years ago. With a general election looming, the Wall Street Journal argues that that RBA might not fancy sparking a political row with a rate cut today, explaining: In 2007, the center-right John Howard government was angered by the perceived advantage a rate hike gave to Mr Rudd's Labor Party during the election campaign. The Greek government hoped to reach a deal with the Troika in time for next Monday's meeting of eurogroup ministers, so they could approve its \u20ac8bn loan. But as Greece's Kathimerini newspaper flags up, there is pessimism in Athens that the deadline will be hit: It writes: Government officials on Monday resumed tough negotiations with troika envoys on a range of economic reforms that Athens must implement in order to secure further rescue loans, including a delayed overhaul of the civil service, with sources indicating that there was hope for some concessions although it appeared unlikely that talks would be completed in time for next Monday\u2019s Eurogroup summit. Another issue on the table is Greece's emergency property tax. The Athens government hopes it could be paid in five installments (which would ease the pressure on households), while the Troika wants it paid in four (meaning more revenue this year). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the latest developments across the eurozone, the financial markets and the world economy. Eurozone tensions are building again as the Greek government resumes talks with its international lenders today over its austerity programme. At stake, the next tranche of aid loans for Greece, worth over \u20ac8bn. Oficials from the Troika are due to meet with the country's new health minister, Adonis Georgidis, to discuss a \u20ac1bn funding gap in Greece's finances caused by debts at its main healthcare provider, EOPYY. There is concern in Greece that the Troika will demand further cutbacks to keep Greece 'on track' with its bailout targets. Georgidis has already hinted at closing some state hospitals to fix the black hole.... Troika officials are also scheduled to hold talks with labour minister Yiannis Vroutsis today, who has already refused to accept any further cuts to the minimum wage. The Troika have already been pressuring Athens to push on with its promised overhaul of the civil service -- laying off 15,000 people by the end of 2015. As our Athens correspondent Helena Smith reported last night, government insiders fear that the \u20ac8bn aid tranche will only be doled out in installments: The troika has made clear that it will only disburse aid when, and if, specific reforms are taken. The likelihood of the country\u2019s super tranche \u2013 \u20ac8.1bn in aid \u2013 being dispatched in installments is now a given. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make for a very heavy climate but they have made it very clear that that is what they are going to do,\u201d said one insider. \u201cEvery time we announce a measure, we\u2019ll get an installment. That is the premise they are working on.\u201d Difficult times. And the situation doesn't look much better in Portugal, where finance minister Vitor Gaspar resigned last night. His successor, treasury secretary, Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque, will be sworn in this afternoon. I'll be watching events through in Athens and beyond through the day.....",

That is the premise they are working on.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Difficult times</strong>.

      "body": "<p>Peter Ruis, the man who transformed John Lewis from a staid shop best known for its sensible cardigans and cosy slippers into a fashion mecca, is leaving the department store to become the boss of Jigsaw.</p> <p>After almost nine years at the retailer, six in charge of fashion, Ruis leaves the clothing side of the business in good shape. Fashion sales topped \u00a31.1bn last year, up from \u00a3700m in 2005, after a string of rave reviews for its own-label brand and designer collections.</p> <p>Andy Street, managing director at John Lewis, said everyone would be sad to see Ruis go. \"Peter has revolutionised our fashion, home and technology offer,\" he said.</p> <p>Ruis, who has also worked at Marks &amp; Spencer, starts at Jigsaw in September, raising hopes that he can sprinkle some magic over the 61-store retailer, which analysts say has become dull and tired.</p> <p>Jigsaw has lost its status as a prominent niche brand on the UK high street, according to Maureen Hinton, a retail analyst at Verdict. She said: \"It seems to have been stuck in a rut and has got an air of yesterday about it \u2026 It just needs someone to go in there and shake it up and rejuvenate it.\"</p> <p>\"[Peter Ruis] has got a very good brand background.

      "bodyText": "Peter Ruis, the man who transformed John Lewis from a staid shop best known for its sensible cardigans and cosy slippers into a fashion mecca, is leaving the department store to become the boss of Jigsaw. After almost nine years at the retailer, six in charge of fashion, Ruis leaves the clothing side of the business in good shape. Fashion sales topped \u00a31.1bn last year, up from \u00a3700m in 2005, after a string of rave reviews for its own-label brand and designer collections. Andy Street, managing director at John Lewis, said everyone would be sad to see Ruis go. \"Peter has revolutionised our fashion, home and technology offer,\" he said. Ruis, who has also worked at Marks &amp; Spencer, starts at Jigsaw in September, raising hopes that he can sprinkle some magic over the 61-store retailer, which analysts say has become dull and tired. Jigsaw has lost its status as a prominent niche brand on the UK high street, according to Maureen Hinton, a retail analyst at Verdict. She said: \"It seems to have been stuck in a rut and has got an air of yesterday about it \u2026 It just needs someone to go in there and shake it up and rejuvenate it.\" \"[Peter Ruis] has got a very good brand background. He understands what brands need to do to stand out.\" Jigsaw had the potential to be a successful niche brand, like Hobbs and Ted Baker, she added, \"but at the moment, it is just a bit dull.\" Ruis said he was \"hugely excited to be joining such an iconic British brand\", which he said had \"huge untapped potential\". Under Ruis's stewardship, John Lewis clothing become a talking point on the fashion pages. He dropped lines with an old-fashioned reputation, such as the British label Jacques Vert, and introduced a range of well-received new collections, such as Somerset, by Alice Temperley, and the cheaper brand Kin. The department store sought to burnish its fashion credentials further last month by putting John Lewis's own-brand menswear on the catwalk at an elite London fashion event. \"We have taken the customer with us, and the more fashionable we get, the more interested they become,\" Ruis told the Observer in an interview in March. He attributed the retailer's success to attracting well-heeled customers across the age range, rather than targeting the 18- 24-year-olds looking for a party outfit. \"Historically, we have been told that our customers are more affluent and a bit older, but increasingly our research has shown that to be a bit simplistic,\" he said. Paula Nickolds will take over his job as buying and brand director in the autumn. Nickolds, 40, joined the company as a graduate trainee 19 years ago and has worked her way up to her current position, as buying director for home products. \"She has a got a good understanding of the John Lewis customer and where [the business] is going as well,\" Hinton said.\"",

      "bodyText": "The UK's construction sector grew for a second month in June, boosted by a rise in house building and supporting expectations that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter. Growth in output and new orders pushed the Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) to 51 from 50.8 in May, where anything above 50 indicates expansion. It was the highest level since May 2012. Companies reported rising levels of client demand and larger volumes of new work.

Housing construction grew at the strongest rate in June according to the PMI, helped by the government's incentive schemes, although growth slowed to 51.5 from 54.4 on the index. Commercial and civil engineering activity hit 50.1 and 50 respectively, improving after several months of contraction. Employment in the sector rose for the first time since February and at the fastest rate since September, driven by the rising levels of new work and an improved outlook. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said that although the positive survey reinforced the likelihood that the MPC will not announce additional stimulus this week, more quantitative easing was possible in August. \"This reflects our belief that Mark Carney is likely to be keen to build up escape velocity from extended economic weakness,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Whitbread has announced a new city centre hotel concept focused on cheaper, smaller rooms in the best locations. The UK's largest hotel group will open its first \"hub by Premier Inn\" in St Martin's Lane in the West End of London in summer 2014. It has committed to four further locations in central London, which will be opened between early 2015 and early 2016 \u2013 Goodge Street, Great Tower Street, Spitalfields and King's Cross. The FTSE 100 company is also planning hub hotels for Edinburgh and other cities. Whitbread said the hubs would be compact and contemporary with \"excellent connectivity that will offer good value for money and appeal to customers who value price, location and design over space\". Andy Harrison, the Whitbread chief executive, insisted there was enough room in the market for both its established budget Premier Inn brand and the new hubs. \"We have 6% of the central London market at the moment so we think we've got a lot to go for,\" he added. Hub rooms will be up to 30% cheaper than Premier Inn rates, with an average room rate in central London below \u00a3100 and starting prices and off-peak rates likely to be around \u00a360. The group is aiming to have around 40 \"hub by Premier Inn\" hotels opened or in the pipeline by 2018, with a total of 6,000 rooms. The hotels will have 25% lower build and operating costs compared with a central London Premier Inn, Whitbread said. Rooms will be 11.4 sq metres and feature a desk that folds into the bed, luggage storage beneath the bed, an en suite bathroom with power shower, free Wi-Fi and a 40-inch smart screen television. There will be a hub app allowing customers to book, check-in online and pre-select room, temperature and light settings, as well as television and radio channels. \"With substantial operating and commercial synergies from the Premier Inn network, we are confident that 'hub' will deliver good returns for our shareholders,\" Harrison said. Whitbread, which also owns Costa Coffee and Beefeater, has 650 Premier Inn hotels and more than 52,000 rooms across the UK and Ireland. It said the new concept hotels would help it to achieve its target of 75,000 UK rooms by 2018.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Abbott\u2019s paid parental leave (PPL) policy is perhaps the policy with which he is most entwined. His statements have been so fixed and constant that any drop or alteration to them would be a serious blow to his policy credentials.</p> <p>As such it deserves close scrutiny. Does it really deliver its proposed benefits? Is it really fully funded?</p> <p>Abbott continually (and rightly) asserts that paid parental leave is a productivity and participation measure.&#xa0;That is, it hopes to increase the number of women staying in the workforce and that, as a result, the overall labour force will be more productive. It is mentioned in the <a href=\"http://www.liberal.org.au/real-solutions/\">Liberal party\u2019s Real Solutions policy document</a> under the heading \u201cImproving productivity by boosting participation\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Tony Abbott\u2019s paid parental leave (PPL) policy is perhaps the policy with which he is most entwined. His statements have been so fixed and constant that any drop or alteration to them would be a serious blow to his policy credentials. As such it deserves close scrutiny. Does it really deliver its proposed benefits? Is it really fully funded? Abbott continually (and rightly) asserts that paid parental leave is a productivity and participation measure. That is, it hopes to increase the number of women staying in the workforce and that, as a result, the overall labour force will be more productive. It is mentioned in the Liberal party\u2019s Real Solutions policy document under the heading \u201cImproving productivity by boosting participation\u201d. So will it actually boost participation? The Liberal party\u2019s PPL scheme is pitched as being (in the oft-said words of Abbott) \u201cfair dinkum\u201d, because it will pay the full replacement wage (up to $150,000 per annum) of the mother for 26 weeks, rather than the current scheme, whereby the mother receives the minimum wage $622.10 per week for 18 weeks. There are thus two differences between the two schemes: the length of leave and the amount of money paid. The government chose its scheme on the back of a 2009 report by the Productivity Commission (PC). It recommended 18 weeks of leave even though it acknowledged that most mothers preferred to spend at least the first 26 weeks with their baby before going back to work. The PC chose 18 weeks because this period would allow those who do wish to take extra leave to \u201cco-fund\u201d the extra amount through annual leave or through savings. It argued around 90% of families would find this option \u201caffordable\u201d. The PC noted however, that while more leave might be better, in terms of overall benefit to the economy, at some point the \u201cbenefits would not be worth the additional costs of forgone spending in other areas such as higher quality childcare or a better health system\u201d. This is an important point when you consider how essential childcare is for women returning to work (and thus participation in the labour force). The PC also noted that \u201cthe impact of the scheme on leave durations ... is greater for lower income, more financially constrained families\u201d. It was concerned mostly about women who earn less because \u201cthey often have low representation in privately negotiated paid parental leave schemes\u201d. The Liberal party\u2019s policy is of most benefit to those on high incomes, but the biggest issue of paid parental leave is actually for women on low incomes. Currently about 35% of all working women earn the minimum wage or less, but those workers only constitute 16% of working women with paid parental leave entitlements. The higher you earn, the very much more likely you are to have a job with paid parental leave: Clearly the benefits of a government providing parental leave at replacement income levels decline as the income of the mother increases \u2013 because it is more likely that their employer is already offering parental leave. The PC found that a scheme such as the current one in place would \u201cmean that the labour supply effects would be greatest for lower income, less skilled women \u2013 precisely those who are most responsive to wage subsidies and who are least likely to have privately negotiated paid parental leave\u201d. This means the spending of government money would get the biggest productivity and participation bang for its buck by paying the minimum wage rather than a replacement wage. So what did the Productivity Commission say about the participation benefits of the Liberal party\u2019s scheme? It found that that a scheme with \u201cfull replacement wages for highly educated, well-paid women would be very costly for taxpayers\u201d. Now you might think that is OK if it improves participation, after all that is the aim of the scheme. However the PC noted that such women already had a \u201chigh level of attachment to the labour force\u201d and that (as the above graph shows) such workers already had \u201ca high level of private provision of paid parental leave\u201d. All up, the PC concluded with damning understatement that PPL \u201cwould have few incremental labour supply benefits\u201d. It may provide a small boost to participation but it is certainly not worth the cost. It should probably give you some pause when your party\u2019s big-ticket policy for improving productivity and participation in the labour market has the Productivity Commission saying at best its benefits would be \u201cfew\u201d. Especially when we get to the cost. When it was first introduced the scheme was to be offset by a \u201cmodest\u201d 1.7% increase in the company tax rate of those earning over $5m. By the 2010 election the levy was down to 1.5% and the cost was rising from $4.3bn for 2012-13 to $4.5 bn for 2013-14. The problem, however, is since then company tax revenue has rather collapsed: Back in the 2010-11 budget, corporate tax revenue for this current financial year was forecast to be over $75bn; in this year\u2019s budget it was forecast to be only $71.6bn. The writedowns from the 2011-12 budget are even more severe. Back then, $81.5bn in company tax revenue was expected to be raised in 2014-15; now, the Treasury is expecting just $72.8bn. Clearly a 1.5% levy on the top 3,200 companies is not going to deliver what was expected back in the 2010 election. And yet the 1.5% levy remains the only stated means the opposition has to pay for the scheme. The rumours now are that the opposition might put off the scheme until the final year of the next term (if they win) or maybe cut out state public servants. But at present they have a productivity and participation policy that doesn\u2019t do much to lift either, and one that is supposed to be paid for by a bucket of money that has become a touch more shallow. Given how inexorably linked this particular policy is with Tony Abbott, and given Andrew Robb stated in May that it was \u201cfully funded\u201d, it might be time we started seeing the costings. At present, analysis of the policy finds it lacking on both the costs and the benefits.",
