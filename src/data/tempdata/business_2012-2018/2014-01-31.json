      "bodyText": "An emerging crisis Raghuram Rajan, the highly regarded governor of India's central bank, said this week that it was time developing countries' role in rescuing the global economy was recognised in Washington. \"International monetary co-operation has broken down,\" he grumbled as the US Federal Reserve continued to turn down the dial on quantitative easing (QE), thereby doing nothing to ease currency worries in many emerging markets, including India. Did co-operation on monetary and fiscal policy ever exist? Up to a point, it did. It was briefly but firmly displayed at G20 level in 2009 as leaders confronted the size of the financial crash. But the US also adopted QE on a massive scale out of self-interest. Similarly, the huge Chinese spending stimulus in 2009 was launched to keep China's economy growing at a safe speed. The combination was good for avoiding economic calamity, but a temporary alignment of interests should not be confused with principled co-ordination. The US Fed cannot be expected to abandon its softly-softly retreat from QE just because a reduction in monthly asset purchases from $75bn (\u00a345.6bn) to $65bn contributes to woes in Turkey and Argentina. Arguably, it would be more dangerous for everybody in the long-run, including emerging countries, if the Fed kept its foot to the floor. But Rajan would have been right to bemoan a separate failure of global co-ordination in the area of banking reform. Shadow banking has exploded in Asia, especially in China, where the outside world crosses its fingers and hopes failing funds will continue to be quietly bailed out by the state. Eurozone leaders are still in semi-denial about the lack of capital in their banking system, a problem that will intensify with a dose of deflation or near-deflation. The relevant question is whether the financial system has been sufficiently reformed and re-capitalised to cope with shifts in currency markets that were bound to arrive one day. It is hard to be optimistic. Bank of England governor Mark Carney, in his capacity as head of the international Financial Stability Board, spoke last September of \"uneven progress\" in recapitalising banks and said financial institutions \"need to improve risk disclosures further\". That was alarming. And it is doubly alarming to hear that a relatively minor adjustment in US monetary policy, which was trailed in advance for months and was born from stronger US economic data, is already generating accusations of unfair tactics. This crisis in emerging markets is starting to look serious. BT and BSkyB playing for high stakes Can BT and BSkyB, supposedly now fierce footballing foes, prosper at the same time? The share prices currently say so, and so do the numbers. BT yesterday achieved its first quarterly rise in revenues since 2009, helped in part by a 6% rise in consumer revenues, the first increase in a decade. Some 2.5 million customers for BT Sport looks to be a decent result, even if some viewers are paying nothing extra. Over at BSkyB, chief executive Jeremy Darroch can afford to be lofty about his \"noisy\" rivals while shouting about some of Sky's gains, like growth in broadband, a new deal with HBO and the number of customers opting for \"connected\" high-definition boxes. Jolly good, but the battle between the two companies is at the phoney stage. The action becomes serious when the next set of Premier League rights go up for auction, likely to be towards the end of this year or early next. Premier League bosses will be salivating. BT, having bagged the rights to Champions League and Europa League football from 2015/16, has surrendered any element of surprise in its bidding tactics. It is plainly hugely ambitious for BT Sport, seeing an opportunity to capitalise on its investment in fibre broadband. At Sky, for all the legitimate boasts about the increased diversity of viewing habits, executives cannot be sure how their business would behave if top-tier football were reduced to a walk-on role. Both sides will already have a good idea of the price they are prepared to pay to secure the best Premier League packages of games. But, to appreciate quite how intense the bidding could become, consider some calculations by media specialists Enders Analysis last year. The UK TV industry currently generates revenues of \u00a312bn from a programming budget of \u00a36bn. Champions League football, currently on Sky and ITV, comprises about 0.3% of total audience over a full year. But BT was willing to pay \u00a3300m a year for those rights \u2013 or \u00a3100m per 0.1% share of total viewing. \"Were all TV to cost that much we would be looking at annual programming spend of upwards of \u00a3100bn,\" said Enders. Of course, all programming does not cost that much, and BT has the excuse-cum-explanation that is building for the long-term. Even so, the risk is high that either BT or Sky does serious financial damage to itself by over-paying. Lloyds cuts credibility Every aspiring financial journalist is taught Hutber's Law, established by Patrick Hutber, City editor of the Sunday Telegraph in the 1960s and 1970s. It states that \"improvement means deterioration\". It came to mind this week as Lloyds Banking Group said it would \"cater more effectively\" for the needs of its business customers by removing 520 business relationship managers, a fifth of the total. Lloyds will struggle to convince small businesses that the cuts are to their advantage. Almost every survey in this area points to a consistent theme. Owners of small businesses want a relationship with an individual at their bank. They go in fear of being treated as an item on a spreadsheet. Business secretary Vince Cable is not persuaded by Lloyds' pitch and has summoned the boss. Quite right too. Hail to the King Justin King, departing chief executive of Sainsbury's, has had enough praise already this week, but he deserves one more clap for waiving the \u00a31.7m severance payment he was contractually entitled to claim. A contract that is so generous to an executive who leaves voluntarily is, of course, silly. If a company is not asking the boss to quit, why should it pay him or her to do so? But there are still plenty of similarly-styled contracts around, and executives who are prepared to collect their entitlements. Richard Meddings, finance director of Standard Chartered, resigned last month saying \"it was totally my decision to leave\". He will depart in June but be paid a salary, pension contribution and other benefits until next January because that's what his contract allows. King, let's hope, has established the precedent that a contract does not always have to be obeyed.",

Labour said that analysis used highly selective statistics, failed to take account of benefits changes and was at odds with recent pay patterns.</p> <p>The main finding in the ONS report was based on different wage data from the Treasury's analysis. But statisticians were still clear that real wages \u2013 which take into account the impact of inflation \u2013 had been falling on almost all measures.</p> <p>The OFT also noted the data used by the Treasury was older than other readings on wages and that it had been distorted by unusual timing of bonus payments. Referring to the period after the Treasury's analysis, the ONS report said:</p> <p>\"All series which reported in the third quarter of 2013 showed wages falling by more than 1.5% on the same quarter a year ago, making it difficult to conclude that there has yet been a break from the trend of falling real wage growth.\"</p> <p>Labour was given further ammunition in its campaign over the cost of living this week when the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/living-standards-not-recover-2015-ifs-miliband\" title=\"\">living standards were unlikely to reach their pre-recession levels before the next election</a>.</p> <p>The general secretary of the TUC, Frances O'Grady, said the ONS figures raised concerns that the squeeze could continue for many years.</p> <p>\"Worryingly, average pay rises have been getter weaker in every decade since the 1980s, despite increases in productivity, growth and profits. Unless things change, the 2010s could be the first ever decade of falling wages,\" she said.</p> <p>The ONS said this latest period of falling real wages appeared to be the latest stage in a series of \"step-changes in annual real wage growth, usually taking place in response to an economic downturn\" \u2013 from an average growth of 2.9% in the 1970s and 1980s, to growth of 1.5% in the 1990s, 1.2% in the 2000s, and then -2.2% since the start of 2010.</p> <p>\"A number of factors may have contributed to this, although it seems likely that a key driver is the response to the fall in productivity in 2008 and 2009, and its subsequent weakness,\" the report added.</p> <p>The ONS also highlighted different inflation rates between what is produced in Britain and what is consumed, helping to explain the divergence between productivity and real wage growth since 2010. In other words, the rate of inflation experienced by workers spending their pay was not the same as the rate of inflation in the goods their employers were selling.</p> <p>The effect from hours worked in the labour market was to put downward pressure on real wage growth during the downturn but upward pressure more recently. Real wages may also have been affected by rises in non-wage costs of hiring, such as national insurance contributions, which can prompt firms to tweak workers' pay to manage their overall costs.</p> <p>Worryingly for an economy still struggling to rebalance towards more manufacturing and away from reliance on consumer demand, there was some effect on real wages from the changing composition of Britain's workforce. That came particularly from the shift from higher paid workers in the manufacturing sector towards lower paid services industries.</p> <p>Business surveys suggest many companies are more optimistic about hiring this year but economists say with many people working fewer hours than they would like, there is still plenty of slack in the labour market and so limited potential for wages growth to accelerate.</p> <p>Andrew Hunter, co-founder of the jobs website Adzuna, said the recovery in the jobs market was far from over.</p> <p>\"Wages are still stuck in a post-recession hangover \u2013 while the backlog of employees waiting for the right time to change jobs is clearing, salary levels are yet to catch up. Compared with this time last year, there are fewer people fighting it out for each position, but the chances of securing a decent salary have become slimmer,\" he said.</p>",

But statisticians were still clear that real wages \u2013 which take into account the impact of inflation \u2013 had been falling on almost all measures. The OFT also noted the data used by the Treasury was older than other readings on wages and that it had been distorted by unusual timing of bonus payments. Referring to the period after the Treasury's analysis, the ONS report said: \"All series which reported in the third quarter of 2013 showed wages falling by more than 1.5% on the same quarter a year ago, making it difficult to conclude that there has yet been a break from the trend of falling real wage growth.\" Labour was given further ammunition in its campaign over the cost of living this week when the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that living standards were unlikely to reach their pre-recession levels before the next election. The general secretary of the TUC, Frances O'Grady, said the ONS figures raised concerns that the squeeze could continue for many years. \"Worryingly, average pay rises have been getter weaker in every decade since the 1980s, despite increases in productivity, growth and profits. Unless things change, the 2010s could be the first ever decade of falling wages,\" she said. The ONS said this latest period of falling real wages appeared to be the latest stage in a series of \"step-changes in annual real wage growth, usually taking place in response to an economic downturn\" \u2013 from an average growth of 2.9% in the 1970s and 1980s, to growth of 1.5% in the 1990s, 1.2% in the 2000s, and then -2.2% since the start of 2010. \"A number of factors may have contributed to this, although it seems likely that a key driver is the response to the fall in productivity in 2008 and 2009, and its subsequent weakness,\" the report added. The ONS also highlighted different inflation rates between what is produced in Britain and what is consumed, helping to explain the divergence between productivity and real wage growth since 2010. In other words, the rate of inflation experienced by workers spending their pay was not the same as the rate of inflation in the goods their employers were selling. The effect from hours worked in the labour market was to put downward pressure on real wage growth during the downturn but upward pressure more recently. Real wages may also have been affected by rises in non-wage costs of hiring, such as national insurance contributions, which can prompt firms to tweak workers' pay to manage their overall costs. Worryingly for an economy still struggling to rebalance towards more manufacturing and away from reliance on consumer demand, there was some effect on real wages from the changing composition of Britain's workforce. That came particularly from the shift from higher paid workers in the manufacturing sector towards lower paid services industries. Business surveys suggest many companies are more optimistic about hiring this year but economists say with many people working fewer hours than they would like, there is still plenty of slack in the labour market and so limited potential for wages growth to accelerate. Andrew Hunter, co-founder of the jobs website Adzuna, said the recovery in the jobs market was far from over. \"Wages are still stuck in a post-recession hangover \u2013 while the backlog of employees waiting for the right time to change jobs is clearing, salary levels are yet to catch up. Compared with this time last year, there are fewer people fighting it out for each position, but the chances of securing a decent salary have become slimmer,\" he said.",

Under bright skies earlier this afternoon protestors ranging from schoolteachers to school guards and state paid cleaners gathered in Athens in what was unanimously described as the first in a series of demonstrations against dismissals ordered by creditors that since May 2010 have kept the Greek economy afloat. The protest was small, a reflection of the exhaustion that has gripped a nation now into its fourth year of EU-IMF mandated austerity. But after relentless tax rises, pay cuts and benefit withdrawals, the prospect of job losses for those in the public sector may well be the tipping point. At stake are the jobs of 2,000 secondary school teachers, 2,200 school guards and 500 cleaners - all currently placed in a \u201cmobility scheme\u201d on 75% of their annual wage. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7148e5b4-a366-4e89-809e-751b5c27df9e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391189047404/4e581258-500b-447a-9075-faf4c20ef390-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Cleaner Despoina Kostopoulou\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cleaner Despoina Kostopoulou Photograph: Helena Smith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\ufeffAmong the protesting cleaners seconded to the finance ministry was Despoina Kostopoulou, a 51-year-old divorced mother-of-two, who was told after 20 years of employment, she would have to go.

      "bodyText": "European markets have ended a turbulent week on a downbeat note. Emerging market fears in the wake of the US Federal Reserve deciding to trim its monthly bond buying programme by another $10bn, as well as signs this week of a slowdown in China, have done the damage. And as the likes of Turkey and India raise interest rates to try and protect their currencies, investors are beginning to wonder if the European Central Bank might take the opposite route and cut the cost of borrowing next week. Meanwhile, the final scores showed: \u2022 The FTSE 100 finished 28.01 points or 0.43% lower at 6510.44, its worst January performance since 2010 \u2022 Germany's Dax dropped 0.71% to 9306.48 \u2022 France's Cac closed 0.34% lower at 4165.72 \u2022 Italy's FTSE MIB bucked the trend and edged 0.03% higher to 19,418.34 \u2022 Spain's Ibex ended down 0.44% to 9920.2 Among the emerging markets Turkey's Bist fell 1.68% but Argentina added 2.4%. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average - down more than 200 points at one stage - is currently 114 points or 0.72% lower. And on that note it's time to close up for the day. Thanks for all the comments, and we'll be back on Monday. Over to Greece where teachers and other civil servants have been protesting layoffs demanded by the debt-stricken country\u2019s \"troika\" of creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF. Helena Smith reports: The mood of defiance is growing in Greece. And so is despair. Under bright skies earlier this afternoon protestors ranging from schoolteachers to school guards and state paid cleaners gathered in Athens in what was unanimously described as the first in a series of demonstrations against dismissals ordered by creditors that since May 2010 have kept the Greek economy afloat. The protest was small, a reflection of the exhaustion that has gripped a nation now into its fourth year of EU-IMF mandated austerity. But after relentless tax rises, pay cuts and benefit withdrawals, the prospect of job losses for those in the public sector may well be the tipping point. At stake are the jobs of 2,000 secondary school teachers, 2,200 school guards and 500 cleaners - all currently placed in a \u201cmobility scheme\u201d on 75% of their annual wage. \ufeffAmong the protesting cleaners seconded to the finance ministry was Despoina Kostopoulou, a 51-year-old divorced mother-of-two, who was told after 20 years of employment, she would have to go. Since being transferred to the scheme in June, she has been forced to survive on \u20ac450 a month, 300 of which is automatically spent on paying her rent. \u201cThe finance minister [Yannis] Stournaras said that it would save the ministry \u20ac2.5m a year if we were dismissed but that sort of money is not going to save Greece,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone can see that this is not fiscal but arithmetic \u2013 the 'troika' simply want quotas to be fulfilled. They want heads, and cleaners are such an easy target. We\u2019re all women, we\u2019re all of a certain age, they think we won\u2019t protest but every day we are outside the ministry shouting as loudly as we can that this is illegal, that this is unfair.\u201d Come March the contracts of all those placed in the scheme will be formally terminated - unless by then they have been able to find posts in other services. \u201cNo person as far as I know has ever found a job in another service,\u201d explained Kostopoulou. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t get my job back I am going to do something very dramatic.\u201d By the end of the year the government has to fire another 15,000 employees from the country\u2019s bloated civil service adding to an unemployment rate currently nudging 28%, the highest in the western world. \ufeffUnlike Kostopoulou, the secondary school teacher Stamatis Nikolaou is not among those who are on course to lose work but he says cuts have made life close to intolerable. \u201cThey say civil servants haven\u2019t hurt as much as employees in the private sector, but since the start of the crisis in 2010 we have lost more than 35% of our income,\u201d says the 55-year-old who has taught mathematics to secondary school students for the past 27 years. \u201cMy own wage has dropped from \u20ac1,700 a month to \u20ac1,300 a month but if you factor in all the tax increases, all the benefit losses and the emergency [property] levy which effects us all, it\u2019s a much bigger drop,\u201d he said. \u201cHonestly it\u2019s got to the point where no one can pay up anymore.\u201d Nikolaou who sits on the administrative board of the secondary school union (OLME) said protests would accelerate ahead of a 24-hour strike on 7 February when Greece\u2019s highest legal body, the Council of State, will hear an appeal by teachers against their induction into the scheme. The tribunal, which last week ruled that security forces be reimbursed for lost pay, issued a similar verdict last night decreeing that university staff should be remunerated for lost benefits \u2013 once again potentially derailing the government\u2019s budget. One of the more hawkish members of the US Federal Reserve, Esther George, has said the decision to begin trimming its bond buying programme was a \"modest but positive step.\" But she warned the $85bn (now $65bn) a month bond buying programme continued to pose risks. George consistency voted against the programme last year but has no vote this year as part of the central bank's rotating system. According to Reuters she said: I remain concerned that continuation of these policies could hav significant long term costs. She warned that banks were already building up risky bets thanks to the programme and this could threaten financial stability in the longer term. Ironically, India's central bank governor warned yesterday that trimming the bond buying was causing problems in emerging markets, something which has been clear over the last few days. US consumer sentiment dipped in January, but was pretty much in line with expectations. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index fell to 81.2 in January, down from 82.5 in December but better than the preliminary reading of 80.4 and forecasts of 81. Survey director Richard Curtin said: \ufeffProspects for either consumers' own personal finances or for the economy as a whole have remained more resistant to improvement especially longer term prospects. This has prevented recent economic gains from building the type of positive upward momentum that has sparked and sustained increases in consumer optimism and confidence. Annalisa Piazza at Newedge Strategy said: T he weak NFP report and adverse weather conditions have not affected consumer confidence much in Jan and the overall picture remains robust for Q1-14. The IMF has called on central banks to make sure the currrent turmoil in emerging markets does not lead to an international funding crunch. A spokesman said some emerging market countries need to take urgent action to improve their economies and added: The turbulence also underscores the need for vigilance among central banks over liquidity conditions in international capital markets. (Quote from Reuters) This echoed an attack by India's central bank governor on the US for trimming its monthly bond buying programme by another $10bn this week, which led to investors becoming more jittery about higher yielding but higher risk markets. To emphasise the point, markets are slumping again today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up around 100 points on Thursday, is currently nearly 200 points or 1.2% lower. The FTSE 100 is down around 85 points or 1.2% while Germany's Dax has dropped 1.77%. Among emerging markets, Turkey's Bist is off 1.3%. Barclays has moved fairly quickly to appoint a new head of compliance after Hector Sants quit in November. After the failure of its experiment with bringing in an enforcer from outside, the bank has given the job to one of its own. Mike Roemer, head of audit since 2012, will join the executive committee immediately and report to chief executive Antony Jenkins. He will be responsible for making sure Barclays complies with laws and regulations after a string of problems including misselling of payment protection insurance and traders rigging the Libor market. Jenkins has promised to clean up Barclays' act and restore trust in the bank among the public, regulators and politicians. The bank announced on Wednesday that legal and regulatory charges would cost it an extra \u00a3330m. Securing Sants as compliance chief was seen as a big move in that direction when he joined early last year but the former head of the Financial Services Authority quit two months ago suffering from stress. Jenkins said: \ufeffHaving a world-class compliance function is vital to Barclays\u2019 success. Mike Roemer will bring his extensive experience and strong leadership skills to compliance, ensuring that Barclays maintains momentum in this crucial area. And with that I'm handing over to my colleague Nick Fletcher. US stock futures are down ahead of the market opening, indicating the S&amp;P 500 is about to record its first monthly fall since August. Factors in the gloomy outlook include: falling eurozone inflation announced earlier, which suggested further stimulus could be needed to prop up the economy Continuing concerns about the outlook for emerging markets at the end of a week when some central banks in developing economies raised rates to try to prop up their currencies Worries about corporate earnings after Mattel and Amazon fell short of expectations for Christmas trading. The consumer confidence figures due out soon are also expected to have slipped back. Here's what Bloomberg said: Data at 9:55 a.m. New York time may show the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of sentiment slipped to 81 in January, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. That compares with a preliminary figure of 80.4 and a December reading of 82.5. Ahead of the more closely watched consumer confidence and purchasing managers surveys, both due at 2:55pm, we've had US consumer spending numbers. Consumer spending rose 0.4%, more than expected, in December but household incomes rose weakly, suggesting the economy could cool slightly. Economists polled by Reuters on average expected a rise of 0.2%. Here's some more info from Reuters' story: \ufeffConsumer spending recorded its strongest gain in three years in the fourth quarter, helping to lift the economy to a 3.2% annual growth rate during that period. However, income was unchanged last month after rising 0.2% in November, possibly reflecting the impact of the end of jobless benefits for about 1.3 million long-term unemployed last month. Income at the disposal of households after adjusting for inflation fell 0.2%. That move could take some steam from consumer spending in the first quarter. The Unite trade union said Ineos, which owns the Grangemouth oil refinery, had withdrawn a libel action against the union. The action helped complicate the dispute between Unite and Ineos in October's confrontation that almost caused the permanent closure of the plant. Ineos was unhappy about allegations made by Unite about the company's owner Jim Ratcliffe. The company had complained separately about how Unite went about its campaign. Unite said Ineos would now be liable to pay Unite's costs of more than \u00a3100,000. Here's Unite general secretary Len McCluskey's statement: \ufeffIneos\u2019 reversal demonstrates that it was completely wrong in its attempts to drag our union through the High Court. Over the last six months our members and our union have been disgracefully misrepresented by sections of the media and by some shamefully opportunistic politicians. Here are the facts of the matter: Unite has been exonerated of criminality on two separate occasions by Police Scotland and now cleared of any defamatory actions. To those who have played any part in the witch-hunt of our union, heed this further vindication and cease your campaign of distortion. Unite expects no apologies from Ineos but we hope that this now draws a line under all dispute issues. Unite members and representatives at Grangemouth, and elsewhere within the Ineos operation, must now be allowed to get on with their jobs knowing that they will be treated with respect.\u201d Labour has reacted to the Office for National Statistics review of real wages since the financial crisis, which I posted about earlier. The ONS said it there was little sign of a letup in the fall of households' spending power \u2013 welcome news for Labour, which is using higher living costs to counter Tory glee about economic growth. Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \ufeff\ufeffThe Tories are so out of touch they deny there's a cost-of-living crisis. But these figures show the biggest fall in real wages since records began 50 years agoWages after inflation have fallen by 2.2% a year since 2010. But while working people are worse off under David Cameron he has chosen this time to give the richest one per cent of earners a huge tax cut. Labour will act to ensure we earn our way to higher living standards for all and tackle the cost-of-living crisis. We will freeze energy prices until 2017, expand free childcare to make work pay, boost the minimum wage and promote the living wage. And we will balance the books in the next Parliament by making fairer choices, including by reversing David Cameron's tax cut for millionaires. My colleague Jill Treanor has written about the stress tests for European banks, details of which were published today. Here's an excerpt. Jill points out that the European Banking Authority gave Ireland's banks the all-clear just before they had to be rescued: \ufeffBritain's four biggest banks will be among 124 across the European Union being subjected to stress tests later this year in an attempt to end lingering doubts about the strength of the banking system five years on from the financial crisis. Barclays, HSBC and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group are named alongside other major banks such as Deutsche Bank and Santander which will be forced to test their ability to withstand shocks to in the financial markets... The stress tests had faced criticism in the past for being too lenient \u2013 Ireland's banks were given a clean bill of health not long before they were bailed out \u2013 and this year the tests for 2014 have increased the threshold from 5%. Reuters is reporting that HSBC has hired Natalie Ceeney, the former head of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), to head the bank's efforts to improve customer service. Ceeney left the FOS, which adjudicates on disputes between banks and customers, in December after four years. Ceeney was a forthright critic of banks' misselling of payment protection insurance - a scandal that has cost the industry billions. HSBC told Reuters it didn't approach Ceeney until after she resigned from the FOS. Let's hope things go better than the last time a bank hired an ex-regulator to sort out internal procedures. Hector Sants, the former chief executive of the Financial Services Authority, only lasted 10 months as Barclays' compliance head before quitting with stress. We've had more reaction to the eurozone inflation figures, which have increased worries about persistent low inflation or even deflation in the trading bloc. Economists point out that the rise came mainly from energy prices, which move up and down a lot, and that core inflation crept up slightly. Most think the European Central Bank (ECB) will hold its fire on a rate cut at next Thursday's meeting \u2013 at least for the time being. James Ashley at RBC Capital Markets said: \ufeffThis report in isolation will not radically alter the ECB\u2019s assessment of the outlook for the euro area (not least as the main source of the move lower this time was energy prices \u2013 an erratic component which has low persistence); nor will it, at this stage, change the Governing Council\u2019s view on the correspondingly appropriate policy stance. But we think it would be wrong to view this report in isolation \u2013 rather, it should be considered alongside the exceptionally weak money/credit data, the volatility in money markets, the still lacklustre recovery in activity, and the sharp move lower in market inflation breakevens/expectations And here's Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight: \ufeffThe renewed dip in Eurozone consumer price inflation to just 0.7% in January puts significant pressure on the ECB to take further stimulative action at its February policy meeting next Thursday. However, we believe it is more likely than not that the ECB will hold fire at its February policy meeting, given that there is evidence that Eurozone economic activity is currently picking up gradually... Nevertheless, we suspect that with Eurozone inflation set to remain very low for a prolonged period, bank lending to businesses continuing to fall markedly and the Eurozone\u2019s recovery likely to remain gradual, the ECB is more likely than not to eventually take further action. The European banks watchdog has set out the terms of its latest \"stress tests\" to check on the financial strength of the continent's banks. The European Banking Authority said the banks would face the toughest checks yet as it seeks to force weak lenders to strengthen and restore confidence in the industry. The idea is that if the banks appear healthy under different grim scenarios then people will feel reassured. The EBA hasn't had a great record. It approved Britain's banks in mid-2011 but the UK regulator then imposed its own far more stringent requirements. Here's Bloomberg's rundown of the main points: \ufeffThe largest banks in Europe will have to show their capital won\u2019t dip below 5.5 percent of their assets in an economic crisis, the European Union\u2019s top banking regulator said. The exercise, which will examine a sample of 124 banks that cover more than half of each European Union member state\u2019s banking industry, is scheduled to begin around the end of May, the European Banking Authority said in a statement. Results will be published at the end of October... Deutsche Bank AG, Banco Santander SA (SAN), BNP Paribas (BNP), Barclays Plc (BARC) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc are among banks that will face exams of their resilience to losses, the regulator said. They\u2019ll be tested on resilience to credit, market and sovereign risk, securitization and cost of funding. Both trading and banking book assets will be tested, according to the authority. Dominic Elliott at Reuters Breakingviews isn't impressed: Back in London, the Financial Conduct Authority has fined State Street UK \u00a322.9m for deliberately misleading its customers. The FCA said that between June 2010 and September 2011 State Street UK wilfully overcharged six clients a total of $20,169,603 (\u00a312.3m). State Street UK\u2019s clients include large investment management firms and pension funds holding the funds and savings of retail investors. Tracey McDermott, the regulator's enforcement head, didn't mince her words: \ufeffThe findings we publish today are another example of a firm that has acted with complete disregard for the interests of its customers. State Street UK allowed a culture to develop in the UK TM business which prioritised revenue generation over the interests of its customers. State Street UK\u2019s significant failings in culture and controls allowed deliberate overcharging to take place and to continue undetected. Their conduct has fallen far short of our expectations. Firms should be in no doubt that the spotlight will remain on wholesale conduct. Unemployment in the eurozone stayed at 12% in December for the third month running. That figure was what the market expected but inflation in the trading zone eased unexpectedly in January. Inflation is well below the European Central Bank's target, creating a problem for its president Mario Draghi. Here's Bloomberg's story: \ufeffEuro-area inflation remained below half of the European Central Bank\u2019s target in January, driven by falling energy prices, adding to the case for policy makers to cut interest rates next week. Consumer prices rose an annual 0.7% after a 0.8% gain in December, the European Union\u2019s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 41 economists was for an increase to 0.9%. That\u2019s the fourth consecutive reading of less than 1%. The Frankfurt-based central bank aims to keep inflation at just under 2%. German 2-year bond yields fell to the lowest since November yesterday after inflation in Europe\u2019s largest economy came in below economists\u2019 expectations, adding to evidence of weak price pressure in the euro region. President Mario Draghi unexpectedly cut the benchmark rate to a record-low 0.25 percent in November after inflation slowed to 0.7 percent. 'While the growth outlook is improving for the currency bloc, the ongoing problems in the banking sector, which are manifested through ongoing credit contraction, will continue to act as a drag on both growth and inflation,' said Colin Bermingham, an economist at BNP Paribas SA in London. 'This will put renewed pressure to act on the ECB.' Economists at the Office for National Statistics have published an article looking at the effects of the economic crisis on real wages in Britain. Their findings cast doubt on claims made by the government last week that real wages were starting to increase. It looks like if there has been any pickup it's been very recent indeed. Here's what the ONS said: \ufeffAll series which reported in Q3 2013 showed wages falling by more than 1.5% on the same quarter a year ago, making it difficult to conclude that there has yet been a break from the trend of falling real wage growth. And here are the main points: \u2022 All ONS measures show real wages falling since 2010. \u2022 The recent period of falling real wages is the longest consistent fall since records began in 1964. \u2022 Low productivity growth seems to be pushing down wages, along with different inflation rates between what is produced in the UK and what is consumed. \u2022 Changes in hours worked affected weekly wages during the downturn, along with changes to workforce composition, but have had less of an effect recently. More on BT, whose third-quarter numbers have pleased investors. Some analysts are uneasy about BT taking on BSkyB in the pricy world of sports broadcasting rights. Here's an excerpt from my colleague Juliette Garside's story: \ufeffBT shares were 3% higher at 383p as the group announced 150,000 new broadband customers in the period and a 60% share of new connections on its network. \"With broadband growth improving and line losses slowing the launch of BT Sport looks to be having a positive impact on churn and customer retention rates,\" said analyst Robin Bienenstock at Bernstein Research. \"But we worry that this more aggressive BT will destabilise the peaceful co-existence that drove market growth and risk a price war further down the line.\" BT Sport attracted half a million extra customers during the period, taking the total to 2.5 million. The number includes those watching via BT's television service, Sky customers watching via satellite, and online viewers using the BT Sport app. The TV service signed 54,000 customers, more than double the previous year. BSkyB has 10.5 million TV customers and added 110,000 broadband subscribers in the three months to the end of December. In Ireland, the long-awaited trial begins next week of three former bosses of Anglo Irish Bank, whose near-collapse in 2008 nearly wrecked the Irish economy. They are accused of lending the bank's money to people, including longstanding customers of the bank, to buy Anglo Irish shares. Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent writes: The trial everyone affected by the Celtic Tiger's collapse is waiting for in Ireland begins next week The process of selecting a jury to try the former chairman and two leading executives of the Anglo Irish Bank begins this morning. The full case will be heard in Dublin's Four Courts next week. Sean FitzPatrick, 65, from Greystones in Co Wicklow, William McAteer, 62, from Rathgar in Dublin, and Pat Whelan, 51, of Malahide in Dublin, are each charged with 16 counts of providing unlawful assistance to 16 individuals to buy shares in the bank. Ireland's Court Service is expecting 500 people to attend jury selection todayAnglo Irish is the bank that almost bankrupted Ireland with billions of euros lent to property speculators and developers during the boom. After the Irish property bubble imploded in 2007 Anglo Irish Bank's bad debts rocketed and it had to be rescued by both the Irish and European taxpayer to the tune of more billions of euros. The main UK company announcement comes from BT, which has posted its first quarterly revenue growth in more than four years. Investors were waiting to see how BT's punt on football TV rights had fared. It has taken on BSkyB on the satellite broadcaster's home turf of English Premier League and European Champions League action. Pretty well is the verdict \u2013 BT's up more than 3% and is the biggest gainer in the FTSE 100, which is a shade down. In a trading update, the formerly state-owned telecoms group said third-quarter revenue was up 2% to \u00a34.6bn, slightly ahead of expectations. Profits beat forecasts too. Panmure Gordon's David Buik isn't getting too euphoric: We've had a spate of good economic news from developed nations over the last few days while markets have been worrying about emerging economies. Yesterday's solid US unemployment figures reinforced the view that the world's biggest economy was recovering and German consumer confidence continued to power ahead. Spain's growth picked up in the third quarter as the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy crept out of recession. Today's eurozone unemployment numbers could be more sobering. Despite the region emerging from recession last year and joblessness falling in Germany, unemployment remains stubbornly high. We'll also get eurozone inflation numbers. Here's what CMC Markets' Michael Hewson had to say: \ufeffToday\u2019s main focus is likely to be on the side effects of current EU policy and the unemployment levels in Europe which remain eye-wateringly high in the southern parts of the economy, and it is here that the good news of recent days is likely to end, with Italian unemployment set to remain at a record high of 12.7% in December, and EU unemployment to remain at 12.1%, just below its record highs of 12.2%. ECB President Mario Draghi continues to push back against further measures to add stimulus to the European economy, despite a continued deterioration in money supply data published earlier this week, and it is hard to see a change in position while German economic data continues to diverge away from the rest of Europe. Today\u2019s EU CPI [inflation] numbers might change that if they show significant weakness, but they are expected to remain at 0.9% for January.",

      "bodyText": "As rain battered the country to produce the worst January weather for at least a century, investors were also forced to seek shelter from the storms hitting global stock markets. The FTSE 100 finished at 6510.44 on Friday, down 28.01 points on the day and 153 points on week. Over the month it lost 239 points or 3.53%, its worst January performance since 2010 when it fell 4.14%. Until just over a week ago, things were looking bright, with the leading index coming within 65 points of its all time high of 6930 as US, UK and European economies seemed finally to have turned the corner. But attention suddenly turned to emerging markets, as it became apparent that the US Federal Reserve's decision to trim its monthly bond buying programme was having a negative effect on high yielding but risky investments. A number of countries, including Turkey, South Africa and India, were forced to raise interest rates to protect their currencies, as investors reacted to the Fed turning off its money taps by pulling their cash out of emerging markets. Wednesday's decision by the US central bank to reduce its stimulus measures by another $10bn - although widely trailed - added to the sense of contagion rapidly spreading. Political and economic problems in Argentina and the Ukraine did not help sentiment, while signs of a manufacturing slowdown in China suggested that the recent optimism about the global recovery might have been premature. A number of disappointing updates from major companies also soured the mood. These ranged from US supermarket group Wal-Mart yesterday on Friday to Royal Dutch Shell, whose A shares fell 44p to 2103.5p on Friday, and Royal Bank of Scotland, down 7.4p at 340p. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: This plethora of bad news appears to have punctured any optimism that stock markets could well be stabilising with sharp falls across the board, as this month's falls wipe out all of December's gains. Among the week's worst performers were, inevitably, companies with large exposures to emerging markets. Drinks group Diageo, which warned of a sales slowdown in China and other fledgling markets, dropped 19.5p to 1800.5p on Friday while SABMiller fell 13p to \u00a327.40, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company closed 54p lower at \u00a316.13 and Unilever ended down 19p at 23.39. Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered lost 20.5p to \u00a312.40. BAE Systems fell 6.9p to 429.1p after Barclays put an underweight rating on the shares with a 380p price target. The bank said: We do not see a compelling organic growth story as a result of stalling Typhoon exports and high exposure to declining US Army budgets, which disproportionately impact BAE's Land business. Whilst we're impressed with the self-help activity to date, we believe there is a limit to the cuts BAE can endure, especially in R&amp;D, to support its competitive position and future growth prospects. In our view this will lead to just 2% earnings per share compound annual growth rate over the next three years and we are 8% below Bloomberg consensus for 2015. But BT climbed 12.4p to 383.3p after well received results. With the volatility once more rife in the market, investors sought out defensive stocks, including tobacco shares. Imperial Tobacco added 41p to \u00a322.23 as Goldman Sachs raised its recommendation on the business from neutral to buy and its price target from \u00a325.45 to \u00a328.40. British American Tobacco was 26.5p better at \u00a329.16 as Goldman repeated its buy rating, albeit cutting its target from \u00a341.20 to \u00a334.20. J Sainsbury was in the spotlight after the surprise announcement that well-regarded chief executive Justin King was stepping down in July. Its shares closed down 4.8p at 344.9p on Friday, having fallen as low as 335p on the day of the news. Among the mid-caps Intu lost 10.4p to 315.6p as the property company confirmed it was in talks with Westfield about buying its Derby shopping centre for around \u00a3400m and a stake in the Merry Hill centre in Dudley. It said any deal, if it happened, would be funded by a mixture of new debt and equity. Analyst Sue Munden at Cantor Fitzgerald said a 10% placing was likely, equivalent to around \u00a3320m. Serco came out with classic good news and bad news. It said on Thursday it had been given another chance at UK government contracts after an investigation into the company overcharging on an electronic tagging deal. But it also warned that 2014 profits could be up to 20% less than market expectations, leading to suggestions it might need to raise extra funding. RBC Capital Markets said: Valuation does not look enticing, given continued risks to forecasts, management uncertainty and a balance sheet that is becoming more stretched. We remain at underperform. Whilst the group is comfortably within its bank covenants.... clearly customers giving out long-term contracts would prefer suppliers in sound financial shape and given we have seen other government suppliers raise cash when debt was at similar levels [to Serco's], we would not rule out an equity raise, especially as there remains uncertainty over some big rebids. But after a 17% fall on Thursday, it recovered 13.9p or 3% to 437.1p. Finally blinkx, the video search and ad group spun out of Autonomy, fell 32% on Thursday after criticism from a US blog by Harvard Business School professor Benjamin Edelman, which raised questions about its advertising tactics and the value it provided for advertisers. The company belatedly responded to the fall, saying: As a matter of course, the company does not normally comment on such matters. However, blinkx has noted a recent blog post by a consultant paid by unnamed third parties, in which he discloses, \"I prepared a portion of this article at the request of a client that prefers not to be listed by name.\" blinkx strongly refutes the assertions made and conclusions drawn in the blog post. The company confirms there has been no material change to the operational and financial performance or outlook for the business, and that fiscal third quarter trading was in line with management expectations. Blinkx recovered some ground yesterday on Friday, adding 8.75p or 7% to 127.5p.",

Unite expects no apologies from Ineos but we hope that this now draws a line under all dispute issues. \"Unite members and representatives at Grangemouth, and elsewhere within the Ineos operation, must now be allowed to get on with their jobs knowing that they will be treated with respect.\" The libel action complicated the dispute between Unite and Ineos at the plant, Scotland's biggest manufacturing site. The union claimed that when talks broke down in September Ineos insisted Ratcliffe would not negotiate without a public apology. The dispute escalated and in October Ratcliffe threatened to shut the entire site if Unite did not accept new working conditions, including cuts to pension and redundancy terms. Unite was forced to give in, leaving rancour between the two sides. An Ineos spokesman said: \"Ineos has dropped its claim in order to draw a line under last year's dispute and focus on working with our employees to build a strong future for the Grangemouth site by implementing the company's survival plan.\"",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "BT's push into football and fibre broadband helped deliver a forecast-beating 2% rise in revenues across the group, with BT Sport attracting half a million extra customers. BT's group pre-tax profits grew 8% to \u00a3722m in the three months to the end of 2013. However, its retail division, which provides broadband, phone services and BT Sport to UK homes, was hit by the cost of securing Premier League and Champions League rights, posting an 8% fall in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda). Retail revenues were higher than the City had expected at \u00a31.85bn, up 4% in the three months to 31 December compared with the same period last year. The drop in retail earnings was offset by a 22% rise at the global services division, which won a new international contract with Tesco. \"Our strategic investments are delivering,\" said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. \"It was another record quarter for fibre take-up and there are now more than 18m premises with access to our fibre. Fibre helps SMEs to compete and underpins our TV plans.\" Patterson insisted he was open to a deal on sports with Sky \u2013 BT could recoup some of its sizable investment in football by wholesaling its BT Sport channels to Sky, which could then sell subscriptions on to its customers. \"We are open to wholesale arrangements with Sky,\" he said. \"Their estimate of what it's worth to them is less than we think it's worth to us, but we'll continue to be available to talk about it.\" BT shares were 3% higher at 383p as the group announced 150,000 new broadband customers in the period and a 60% share of new connections on its network. \"With broadband growth improving and line losses slowing, the launch of BT Sport looks to be having a positive impact on churn and customer retention rates,\" said analyst Robin Bienenstock at Bernstein Research. \"But we worry that this more aggressive BT will destabilise the peaceful co-existence that drove market growth and risk a price war further down the line.\" BT Sport attracted half a million extra customers during the period, taking the total to 2.5 million. The number includes those watching via BT's television service, Sky customers watching via satellite, and online viewers using the BT Sport app. The TV service signed 54,000 customers, more than double the previous year. BSkyB has 10.5 million TV customers and added 110,000 broadband subscribers in the three months to the end of December. Around 2.5 million people are now using BT's fibre-optic network, which connects exchanges to cabinets, with 1.9 million of them buying it from BT. It was the busiest quarter ever for new fibre customers, with 228,000 signing up. The company now expects its capital expenditure on items such as network improvements to fall this financial year compared with last year. This allowed BT to raise its guidance for the full year. Ebitda is now expected to be at the upper end of the previously given \u00a36.0bn to \u00a36.1bn range.",

      "body": "<p>BT's push into football and fibre broadband helped deliver a forecast-beating 2% rise in revenues across the group, with BT Sport attracting half a million extra customers.</p> <p>BT's group pre-tax profits grew 8% to \u00a3722m in the three months to the end of 2013. However, its retail division, which provides broadband, phone services and BT Sport to UK homes, was hit by the cost of securing Premier League and Champions League rights, posting an 8% fall in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda).</p> <p>Retail revenues were higher than the City had expected at \u00a31.85bn, up 4% in the three months to 31 December compared with the same period last year.</p> <p>The drop in retail earnings was offset by a 22% rise at the global services division, which won a new international contract with Tesco.</p> <p>\"Our strategic investments are delivering,\" said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. \"It was another record quarter for fibre take-up and there are now more than 18m premises with access to our fibre. Fibre helps SMEs to compete and underpins our TV plans.\"</p> <p>Patterson insisted he was open to a deal on sports with Sky \u2013 BT could recoup some of its sizable investment in football by wholesaling its BT Sport channels to Sky, which could then sell subscriptions on to its customers.</p> <p>\"We are open to wholesale arrangements with Sky,\" he said. \"Their estimate of what it's worth to them is less than we think it's worth to us, but we'll continue to be available to talk about it.\"</p> <p>BT shares were 3% higher at 383p as the group announced 150,000 new broadband customers in the period and a 60% share of new connections on its network. \"With broadband growth improving and line losses slowing, the launch of BT Sport looks to be having a positive impact on churn and customer retention rates,\" said analyst Robin Bienenstock at Bernstein Research. \"But we worry that this more aggressive BT will destabilise the peaceful co-existence that drove market growth and risk a price war further down the line.\"</p> <p>BT Sport attracted half a million extra customers during the period, taking the total to 2.5 million. The number includes those watching via BT's television service, Sky customers watching via satellite, and online viewers using the BT Sport app. The TV service signed 54,000 customers, more than double the previous year. BSkyB has 10.5 million TV customers and added 110,000 broadband subscribers in the three months to the end of December.</p> <p>Around 2.5 million people are now using BT's fibre-optic network, which connects exchanges to cabinets, with 1.9 million of them buying it from BT. It was the busiest quarter ever for new fibre customers, with 228,000 signing up.</p> <p>The company now expects its capital expenditure on items such as network improvements to fall this financial year compared with last year. This allowed BT to raise its guidance for the full year. Ebitda is now expected to be at the upper end of the previously given \u00a36.0bn to \u00a36.1bn range.</p>",
