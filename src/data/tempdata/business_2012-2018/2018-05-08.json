      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers suffered the sharpest drop in business in more than two decades last month as bad weather, the squeeze on household budgets and the timing of Easter led to a hefty cut in consumer spending. In the latest evidence of the slowdown in the economy since the turn of the year, the latest health check from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG found that sales were down by 3.1% in April, the biggest decline since the survey was launched in 1995. Spending on non-food items has been particularly hard hit over the last three months, and retailers are braced for tough trading conditions to continue for the rest of the year even though wages have now started to rise more quickly than prices. Retailers have been hit hard by a combination of problems on top of the squeeze on spending, including higher labour costs as a result of increases in the minimum wage, the shift to online shopping and rapidly changing spending patterns. Toys R Us and the electricals retailer Maplin collapsed in February and a number of retailers, including House of Fraser, New Look, Carpetright and Poundworld, are all pursuing agreements with their landlords to cut their rents and close stores. The industry had been expecting that year-on-year comparisons would look poor for April, but the BRC\u2019s chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the problem ran deeper. \u201cWith much of the spending in preparation for the bank holiday weekend falling in March this year, a record low in sales growth, in contrast to last year\u2019s record high, does not come as a surprise. However, even once we take account of these seasonal distortions, the underlying trend in sales growth is heading downwards. \u201cThe first glimpse of summer may have temporarily lifted clothing and footwear, but non-food sales overall continue to be weak. Consumers\u2019 discretionary spending power remains under pressure and the reality is, that with only a gradual return to solid growth in real incomes expected, the market environment is likely to remain extremely challenging for most retailers.\u201d The BRC/KPMG survey showed an even bigger drop in monthly sales once the figures were adjusted for changes in the amount of shop-floor space over the past year. On a like-for-like basis spending fell by 4.2%. The latest official retail sales figures from the Office for National Statistics showed sales volumes were down 1.2% in March, when unusually harsh weather kept consumers away from the shops. Retailers are now hoping that the royal wedding later in May and the World Cup in June and July will boost spending. KPMG\u2019s head of retail, Paul Martin, said: \u201cRetailers have got their work cut out to overcome seemingly endless obstacles, whether it be unpredictable weather or the introduction of new regulation, like GDPR [the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation]. \u201cThe upcoming months will provide a number of opportunities for retailers to drive sales and navigate this assault course, including bank holidays, World Cup and of course the royal wedding, although it is clear that trading will remain challenging.\u201d The data and analytics company GlobalData said after a flat year in 2017 clothing and footwear volumes would not start growing again until 2019. GlobalData\u2019s senior retail analyst, Mamequa Boafo, said: \u201cThe prioritisation of leisure spending and preference for experiences over \u2018stuff\u2019 will see consumers shopping from their own wardrobes this year, utilising what they have already and only buying clothing items they can truly justify spending money on.\u201d Retail vacancies fall Vacancies in the retail industry fell steeply in April as employers reacted to the fall in high street sales by cancelling plans to hire more workers. According to a recruitment industry survey, the retail sector tumbled from the third most-active recruiter to the 10th compared with April 2017 behind hotel and catering and nursing and medical care, which lay eighth and ninth in the rankings, respectively. Tom Hadley, director of policy at the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation, said a string of high street shop closures fuelled the fall in demand for permanent retail staff last month. \u201cWith consumers increasingly shopping online, it\u2019s a good time for retail workers to think about how their skills translate into other areas within the business \u2013 for example, recruiters say there\u2019s huge demand for staff in IT, and there is also a shortage of order pickers and packers. \u201cHelping people make career transitions will become increasingly important in this fast-changing business and employment landscape,\u201d he said. Demand for staff is still on the rise in every other sector, he said, but the number of workers chasing each job has dropped steadily since last year. Engineering and IT and computing staff were the most in-demand, with accounting/financial and executive/professional in third and fourth.",

      "bodyText": "So much for the post-crisis idea that the UK\u2019s big four banks would be knocked off their comfortable perches by a combination of new technology and \u201cchallenger\u201d banks. A decade on, it\u2019s hard to detect a meaningful shift in market shares. Lloyds Banking Group, the undisputed leader in the UK, isn\u2019t noticeably weaker for being shorn of TSB and last year got bigger in credit cards, the only corner in which it was underweight, by buying MBNA\u2019s operation in the UK. It\u2019s little wonder, then, that challengers are concluding they won\u2019t get far on their own. CYBG, which isn\u2019t a true new-breed challenger anyway since Clydesdale Bank was born in Glasgow in 1838 and Yorkshire Bank in Halifax in 1859, wants to merge with Virgin Money to \u201ccreate the UK\u2019s leading challenger bank\u201d to offer \u201ca genuine alternative to the large incumbent banks\u201d. Top marks for hype but the proposal looks more defensive than aggressive. The idea is to create a full-service bank, which both parties would struggle to do quickly under their own steam. CYBG is stronger in small business banking and current accounts, whereas Virgin is focused on mortgages, savings and credit cards. So, yes, there is commercial logic here. If Virgin is keen, it may be able to push CYBG to improve its terms. Just don\u2019t expect the banking landscape to quake. With 6 million customers, the new entity would overtake TSB but would still be miles behind banking\u2019s second tier, which comprises Santander UK and Nationwide Building Society. Indeed, compare deal sizes. Virgin Money is valued at \u00a31.6bn on CYBG\u2019s proposal but Lloyds\u2019 paid \u00a31.9bn for its MBNA purchase and could call the deal a fill-in. The difference in scale is enormous. One of these decades, the financial technology, or fintech, revolution may change the rules of engagement. But for the time being, the benefits of size remain enormous for the bigger beasts, and were reinforced by the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s timid report into the sector in 2015. A merger between CYBG and Virgin would be sensible for both banks \u2013 but it would also confirm that politicians were selling a false prospectus when they said \u201cchallenger\u201d banks would change everything. Shire takeover: debt-heavy and overambitious For most bidding companies, a 18% fall in their own share price during takeover negotiations would kill the adventure stone dead. That is especially so when the bid is high-risk, cross-border and involves raising monumental sums of debt. Takeda Pharmaceutical of Japan, though, is undeterred. It has spent six weeks tying to get the board of the FTSE 100 firm Shire to agree terms and has finally got a thumbs-up for a cash-and-shares offer at \u00a346bn, or a shade over \u00a349 a share. The fact of a recommendation was enough to give Takeda\u2019s shares a small bounce for almost the first time since this saga started in March. Yet, for those looking in from the outside, this proposed deal \u2013 which is really a reverse takeover since Takeda is the smaller company \u2013 screams of over-aggressive financing. Takeda is taking on a cool $31bn (\u00a322bn) of bridging finance and the new combination would start life with debt equivalent to between four and five times its top-line operating profits. A maximum of two times is generally deemed prudent in an industry such as pharmaceuticals where drugs can fail in clinical trials despite hefty investment. Don\u2019t worry, says the Takeda chief executive, Christophe Weber, a former GlaxoSmithKline executive, the ratio will fall to two times within \u201cthree to five years\u201d because the cashflows are strong and because annual cost savings of $1.4bn can be found. Well, yes, if everything runs perfectly, the financial arithmetic can be made to work. But take a step back: Takeda is offering a mighty 64% premium to Shire\u2019s share price in mid-March. That\u2019s one hell of a punt to take to join the pharmaceutical big league. Weber has convinced Shire\u2019s board, which was his first battle. But gaining support from shareholders will not be straightforward. Both sets of investors have reasons to worry: this deal looks ambitious in the sense of being top-of-the-market and a lot can happen before the intended completion next year. Smaller is beautiful, says Martin Sorrell Sir Martin Sorrell didn\u2019t explain his departure from WPP \u2013 no surprise there \u2013 but he did tell a conference in New York on Tuesday that he wanted to \u201cstart again\u201d in the advertising business. He also has an idea for what a 21st-century agency should look like: \u201cMore agile, more responsive, less layered, less bureaucratic, less heavy.\u201d One assumes those comparisons are with WPP itself. If so, why didn\u2019t he change the model when he had the chance?",

A merger between CYBG and Virgin would be sensible for both banks \u2013 but it would also confirm that politicians were selling a false prospectus when they said \u201cchallenger\u201d banks would change everything.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Shire takeover: debt-heavy and overambitious</h2> \n<p>For most bidding companies, a 18% fall in their own share price during takeover negotiations would kill the adventure stone dead. That is especially so when the bid is high-risk, cross-border and involves raising monumental sums of debt. Takeda Pharmaceutical of Japan, though, is undeterred. It has spent six weeks tying to get the board of the FTSE 100 firm Shire to agree terms and has finally <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/08/adderall-shire-takeover-takeda-virgin-money\">got a thumbs-up</a> for a cash-and-shares offer at \u00a346bn, or a shade over \u00a349 a share.</p> \n<p>The fact of a recommendation was enough to give Takeda\u2019s shares a small bounce for almost the first time since this saga started in March. Yet, for those looking in from the outside, this proposed deal \u2013 which is really a reverse takeover since Takeda is the smaller company \u2013 screams of over-aggressive financing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8d6e0694-ea97-42ee-bb4d-35e4e57402f3\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong>Takeda</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>History</i><br>Dates back to 1781 when Chobei Takeda I began selling traditional Japanese and Chinese herbal medicines in Osaka</p>\n    <p><i>Products</i></p>\n    <p>Actos for diabetes; Prevacid for heartburn; Protonix for acid reflux; cancer drug Velcade; Entyvio for colitis and Crohn\u2019s</p>\n    <p><i>Focus</i><br>Oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience, vaccines</p>\n    <p><i>Employees worldwide</i><br>30,000 in more than 70 countries\u200b</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Shire</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>History</i><br>Founded in 1986 by four entrepreneurs in Basingstoke, Hampshire</p>\n    <p><i>Products</i><br>Adderall and Vyvanse for ADHD; rare disease drug Cinryze, used to treat angioedema (swelling) attacks; dry-eye drug Xiidra</p>\n    <p><i>Focus</i><br>Hyperactivity and rare diseases, including haemophilia</p>\n    <p><i>Employees worldwide</i><br>23,000</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Takeda is taking on a cool $31bn (\u00a322bn) of bridging finance and the new combination would start life with debt equivalent to between four and five times its top-line operating profits.

Well, yes, if everything runs perfectly, the financial arithmetic can be made to work. But take a step back: Takeda is offering a mighty 64% premium to Shire\u2019s share price in mid-March. That\u2019s one hell of a punt to take to join the pharmaceutical big league.</p> \n<p>Weber has convinced Shire\u2019s board, which was his first battle. But gaining support from shareholders will not be straightforward. Both sets of investors have reasons to worry: this deal looks ambitious in the sense of being top-of-the-market and a lot can happen before the intended completion next year.</p> \n<h2>Smaller is beautiful, says Martin Sorrell</h2> \n<p>Sir Martin Sorrell didn\u2019t explain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/14/martin-sorrell-steps-down-as-head-of-wpp-advertising-agency\">his departure from WPP</a> \u2013 no surprise there \u2013 but he did tell a conference in New York on Tuesday that he wanted to \u201cstart again\u201d in the advertising business. He also has an idea for what a 21st-century agency should look like: \u201cMore agile, more responsive, less layered, less bureaucratic, less heavy.\u201d One assumes those comparisons are with WPP itself. If so, why didn\u2019t he change the model when he had the chance?</p>",

      "bodyText": "And finally..... our Money editor Patrick Collinson explains how Sir Richard Branson could make a large profit, if CYBG succeed in taking over Virgin Money: Virgin Money traces its origins back to the 1995 launch of Virgin Direct, an investment business, but it was the takeover of Northern Rock in 2011 that propelled it into a large-scale operation. As chancellor, George Osborne nearly four years after nationalising the bank at the height of the financial crisis. The price paid by a consortium of investors, led by Branson, was the UK taxpayer had injected into bank. Osborne said at the time that the deal represented value for money for UK taxpayers. Branson\u2019s consortium included the US billionaire, Wilbur Ross, now Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary. It bought the \u201cgood\u201d half of the bank, including its branch network, funded by retail deposits. The \u201cbad\u201d part of Northern Rock \u2013 which included its fabled 125% mortgages \u2013 remained in public hands, although defaults and losses have been much lower than anticipated. That\u2019s all for today. My colleagues in the US will be covering Donald Trump\u2019s decision on Iran here: Despite Shire\u2019s best efforts, the FTSE 100 has ended the day down 1 point at 7565, a most underwhelming result. Here\u2019s our news stories on the main business events of the day so far: Nick Field, Director at corporate finance adviser Livingstone, reckons that merging Virgin Money into Yorkshire Bank and Clydesdale would make sense: \u2018Creating a \u2018challenger\u2019 bank of real scale with total assets in excess of \u00a380 billion clearly has attractions. As both parties have relatively strong retail deposit franchises, the realisation of synergies on the asset side of the balance sheet and in operational costs will be key to drive value for shareholders in the merged group.\u2019 \u2018The Virgin Money team have a great track record of execution having turned a legacy mortgage portfolio into a strong, growing consumer brand covering a range of financial products. The value of that strong brand and management is tangibly expressed by the price reaction to the offer, with Virgin Money enjoying a considerable premium whilst CYBG has slightly declined.\u2019 Wall Street has opened cautiously, with the main indices dipping ahead of president Trump\u2019s announcement tonight.... The oil price is likely to move sharply at 7pm UK time, when Donald Trump reveals his decision on Iran. Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank\u2019s Head of Commodity Strategy, says: There are multiple options available to President Trump which makes this such a binary event where the price could move sharply in either direction. The three most likely options currently being mentioned are: 1) Waiver the sanctions again while allowing time to renegotiate the deal 2) A soft exit being the refusal to waive sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil export. It would give companies 180 days to wind down their deals before sanctions are implemented. Furthermore it would provide the US and Europe more time to find a common ground. 3) A hard exit which could see Trump remove the waiver with immediate effect The financial markets are becalmed today, with very little action to report. In London, the FTSE 100 is up a mere 9 points at 7576 this lunchtime, as City traders abandon their terminals to sunbath. The oil price is down a little, with Brent crude off 0.6% at $75.66 per barrel. Yesterday it reached its highest level since 2014, ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s decision on whether to allow sanctions on Iran. This would be the first step towards ending the nuclear deal agreed by Barack Obama\u2019s administration (in which sanctions were lifted, in return for Iran halting its nuclear weapons programme). Analysts fear that ending the deal could spark new tensions in the Middle East, and also destabilise the Iranian economy. Trump, though, has long argued it\u2019s a bad deal, and may now act..... If Takeda can win shareholder support, then it will acquire Shire for 64.4% more than its value back in March. Such a whopping premium shows that the Japanese firm is desperate for Shire\u2019s pipeline of rare drugs, and its established sales in America. Associated Press explains: Shire gives Takeda a larger presence in the U.S. and expertise in rare diseases, an increasingly important area for pharmaceutical companies as patents on established drugs expire. Even though Shire\u2019s headquarters are in Dublin, it earns more than two thirds of its revenue in the U.S. on drugs like Adderall, which is used for ADHD. Takeda, meanwhile, has like many Japanese companies been expanding overseas to compensate for slowing growth at home. Last year it bought Ariad Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Takeda is valued at about $34 billion and makes almost half of its sales in Asia, and about a third in the U.S. Among its top sellers are Entyvio, used to treat ulcerative colitis, and cancer drug Leuprorelin. In other banking news, Royal Bank of Scotland is refusing to abandon plans to close 50 branches in Scoland. C EO Ross McEwan told MPs on the Scottish Affairs Committee that the decision was the \u201cbest way of going forward\u201d, despite public anger over the plan. \u201cI do recognise that customers are very disappointed that their local branch is closing\u201d. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done here with a package of different ways of operating with this bank is, I think, the best way of going forward, that we can keep those services to our customers as well as moving away from physical distribution when it\u2019s just not being used.\u201d That\u2019s not going to please RBS customers who find that their nearest branch has closed. In theory, new technology means less need for banks to maintain a physical presence on the high street; in practice, TSB\u2019s tech meltdown has shown the problems with that approach. Back in the City, Shire\u2019s share price has dipped below the \u00a340 mark. At \u00a339.90 (up 3.5% today), it\u2019s further away from the \u00a348 per share which Takeda has agreed to pay. That underlines the fact that shareholders may not back Takeda\u2019s offer, even though Shire\u2019s board have accepted it. The Japanese firm will hope to change the City\u2019s mind in the months ahead, and points out that the deal isn\u2019t meant to complete until next year. But Takeda certainly has work to do to pull off the biggest pharmaceuticals deal since 2000, as David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Shares in Shire have been given a nice boost in recent weeks after Takeda made two unsuccessful bids for the company. On the other side of the coin, Takeda\u2019s share price has dropped over 30% since the January high, and given the negative market reaction to their pursuit of Shire, there may be some investors who are sceptical about the offer. Another 35 workers have lost their jobs following the collapse of construction and outsourcing group Carillion. The Official Receiver, which took control of Carillion after its liquidation in January, announced the bad news this morning. It means that almost 2,300 of the company\u2019s 20,000 workers have been laid off, while 11,489 have been saved. The news comes as MPs hold an investigation into the lessons that can be learned from Carillion. Phil Bentley, the CEO of outsourcing group Mitie, told the Public Accounts Committee it was \u201cvery sad\u201d to see more than two thousand people losing their jobs. He argued that Carillion was brought down by problems at its construction arm - where cost overruns at several contracts created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d, claiming: It\u2019s not a failure of the outsourcing model. Bentley also pointed to Carillion\u2019s used of \u2018off balance sheet\u2019 instruments, which made it harder to tell the strength (or weakness) of its balance sheet. Rupert Soames, CEO of outsourcer Serco, argued that the government should get some credit for its handling of the crisis. Because ministers did their homework early, they were ready for the moment that Carillion \u201ctried to put a gun to their head\u201d and demanded support, explained Soames. The government didn\u2019t cave in, as it knew what would happen if Carillion went into receivership. I don\u2019t know about a single hospital floor that been left uncleaned or a school meal that\u2019s not been delivered, because the government did its contingency planning. Soames defended the outsourcing model used in Britain today, saying there is close scrutiny of the private sector companies who help to run public services. But other experts are more critical of outsourcers. The Guardian\u2019s David Walker, for example, told the committee that the cost savings have tailed off, the innovation promised by outsourcing firms hasn\u2019t been delivered, and the promised transfer of risk from public to private sector hasn\u2019t happened either. With the UK housing market looking weak, there\u2019s every reason for the Bank of England to resist raising interest rates at its monetary policy meeting on Thursday. A few weeks ago, the BoE was widely expected to hike borrowing costs this month -- having dropped heavy hints that a rise was coming. However, investors have rapidly changed their minds, following a flurry of disappointing economic data of late. Sajiv Vaid, portfolio manager at Fidelity MoneyBuilder Income Fund, says the Bank of England is now in a fix. If it raises Bank rate, it could panic the City. If it doesn\u2019t, then governor Mark Carney will face fresh criticism for having hinted that rates were going up soon. As Vaid puts it: So, having raised expectations (not for the first time either!), the BoE now find themselves in an unenviable dilemma of \u201cdamned if they do and damned if they don\u2019t...\u201d, a horrible predicament for any central bank to find themselves in. The situation in the UK precisely highlights the difficulty global central banks face with signalling rate hikes in the post-GFC era. Remember, it took twelve months before the US implemented its second rate hike in December 2016. Patience is key for the BoE at this stage and I\u2019d argue there are lessons to be learned from the US, where the Fed, despite the long pause, has subsequently raised interest rates a further four times with their credibility remaining intact. We think a pause from the BoE is appropriate, given the domestic backdrop and signs that the frothiness in global GDP may well have stalled, which should provide a supportive backdrop for UK fixed income assets. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take on the UK hosing market: Britain\u2019s housing market has been cooling for the past two years, with London seeing the sharpest slowdown. Monthly mortgage approvals have slipped and reports point to waning interest from potential buyers. \u201cHousing demand has softened in the early months of 2018, with both mortgage approvals and completed home sales edging down,\u201d said Russell Galley at Halifax. The news that UK house prices fell last month has sent a shiver through the sector: Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, says Halifax\u2019s figures are a blow - the housing market should be enjoying a spring revival, not subsiding. Although a little historic, these figures are disappointing as there is a market of sluggish growth and transactions, despite still showing modest price rises. And yet we are entering what is supposed to be the busy spring buying season, which tends to set the tone for the rest of the year. \u2018More recently, activity and listings have picked up but we are finding the market still quite sensitive and only those prepared to negotiate hard are moving on. \u2018Now that interest rates are unlikely to go up this month, hopefully there will be more interest, and particularly from first-time buyers, to take advantage of competitive mortgage deals and realistic prices.\u2019 Jonathan Samuels, CEO of property lender Octane Capital, reckons Brexit is hurting the market: The property market is a mirror of the economy, lacking any real momentum and simply idling along. While inflation has fallen and wages have been edging up, this will take time to filter through so it\u2019s no surprise transaction levels remain low. In recent years many households have taken on a lot of cheap debt and, despite the weak Q1 GDP data, remain wary of rising interest rates and the fast-approaching reality of Brexit. Howard Archer of EY Item Club says the UK housing market is struggling to \u201cgain traction\u201d We expect house price gains over 2018 will be limited to a modest 2%. At this stage, we expect prices to rise by 3% in 2019 The fundamentals for house buyers are likely to remain challenging. Consumers have faced an extended serious squeeze on purchasing power, which is only gradually easing. Additionally, housing market activity remains hampered by relatively fragile consumer confidence and limited willingness to engage in major transactions. House buyers will also likely be concerned about further interest rate hikes over the coming months. While a rate hike in May now seems improbable, we suspect the Bank of England is still more likely than not to increase interest rates later this year and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney still indicated that the UK should prepare for \u201ca few interest rate rises over the next few years\u201d. But....Neal Hudson of Residential Analysts says we shouldn\u2019t get carried away by the monthly house price data: Newsflash: UK house prices took a nasty tumble last month, fuelling concerns that consumer confidence is weakening. Prices fell by 3.1% during April, according to the latest Halifax house price survey -- the biggest monthly decline since September 2010. That monthly data can be volatile so should be treated cautiously. But Halifax also reports that prices fell by 0.1% during the last quarter, and are only 2.2% higher than a year ago. Economist Simon French of Panmure Gordon says house prices seem to be in a downward trend: If Virgin Money does fall to CYBG\u2019s takeover bid, it will lower the number of smaller banks trying to shake up British finance. Sir Richard Branson created Virgin Money more than two decades ago. In 2011, the bank strengthened its position by buying the \u2018good\u2019 portion of Northern Rock for \u00a3747m. Such challenger banks have had a bad press recently, with TSB bungling its move to a new IT platform. As the FT\u2019s Matthew Vincent puts it: If the deal goes through, it would mean Virgin Money\u2019s challenge to the UK high street banks comes to an end after just six years - having bought the old Northern Rock business after it was bailed out by the government during the financial crisis. But, merging Virgin with Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank could create a more powerful competitor, he adds.... CYBG would certainly gain scale from Virgin\u2019s presence in the mortgage market and expand into credit cards. Virgin Money would gain access to current accounts and small business lending, which it has struggled to develop on its own organically Boom! Shares in Virgin Money have jumped by almost 10% in early trading. Virgin\u2019s shares are trading at 338p, valuing the company at \u00a31.5bn -- close to CYBG\u2019s takeover offer. Rumours have been swirling for weeks that Virgin could receive a takeover offer. This may explain why its shares rose last week, as Garry White of investment manager Charles Stanley points out: City analyst Mike van Dulken of Accendo Markets has also spotted the gap between Shire\u2019s share price and the Takeda offer... Shares in Shire have jumped by 5% in early trading, following the news that Takeda\u2019s takeover offer has been accepted. That takes them to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard. However, shares are only trading around \u00a340.50, while Takeda\u2019s offer values Shire at a juicier \u00a349 each. That suggests the City isn\u2019t convinced that this deal will actually get the green light from shareholders. There are concerns that Takeda will be forced to borrow heavily to finance the acquisition, which could undermine its credit rating. Shire\u2019s chief executive, Flemming Ornskov, says Takeda\u2019s \u00a346bn deal is in the best interests of shareholders. Ornskov also claims it could help create better drugs for patients too. \u201cI would like to thank the entire Shire team for all that we have accomplished over the last five years to transform Shire into the leading rare disease biotech company and a tenacious champion for patients in need. \u201cI am confident that this relentless focus will enable us to continue delivering against our priorities throughout this process. \u201cWith a truly innovative portfolio and pipeline, I believe that the combination of the two companies is in the best interests of shareholders and offers an opportunity to improve the lives of even more patients globally with rare and highly specialised conditions.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The City has got back to work after the long weekend with a bang, thanks to two takeover bids. The big news is that Japan\u2019s Takeda has just reached an agreement to buy pharmaceuticals group Shire, listed on Britain\u2019s FTSE 100. Takeda has agreed to pay \u00a346bn (or $62.42bn) for Dublin-headquartered Shire, which produces the ADHD hyperactivity drug Adderall and also has a strong pipeline of treatments for rare diseases. Shire\u2019s board backed the deal, after Takeda agreed to boost the amount of cash in its offer. According to Bloomberg, it will be the biggest overseas acquisition ever by a Japanese company -- assuming shareholders back the plan. The offer is a 59.6% premium on Shire\u2019s value on March 27, just before Takeda revealed its interest. Christophe Weber, CEO of Takeda, says that acquiring Shire will help create \u201ca stronger Takeda\u201d. Together, we will be a leader in providing targeted treatments in gastroenterology, neuroscience, oncology, rare diseases and plasma-derived therapies. We are looking forward to the benefits this combination will bring to patients worldwide, the opportunities it will bring for our employees and the returns it will deliver for our shareholders.\u201d But as one deal reaches its conclusion, another is beginning... Virgin Money, the UK challenger bank, has just received a takeover offer from the parent company behind Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank. In a statement to the City, Virgin says: Virgin Money Holdings (UK) plc (\u201cVirgin Money\u201d) notes the press speculation, and confirms that on the evening of 7 May 2018, it received a preliminary and conditional proposal from CYBG to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Virgin Money. Under the terms of the proposal, Virgin Money shareholders would receive 1.1297 new CYBG shares for each Virgin Money share. The Board of Virgin Money is in the process of reviewing this proposal. There can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to take no action in relation to this proposal. More on that shortly...... Also coming up today Oil has hit a four-year high, as traders brace for Donald Trump\u2019s decision on whether to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal decision. UK foreign secretary Boris Johnson has flown to New York in a last-ditch attempt to sway the president. An announcement could come at 2pm New York time. The UK stock market is expected to gain 13 points at the open, but European indices might dip: Investors will also have one ear on Zurich, where the head of America\u2019s central bank is speaking this morning.

We think a pause from the BoE is appropriate, given the domestic backdrop and signs that the frothiness in global GDP may well have stalled, which should provide a supportive backdrop for UK fixed income assets.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5af1741fe4b0123ab0021345\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2018-05-08T09:56:09.007Z\">10.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take on the UK hosing market:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Britain\u2019s housing market has been cooling for the past two years, with London seeing the sharpest slowdown.

      "bodyText": "Richard Branson could bag a large profit on the sale of Virgin Money after receiving a \u00a31.6bn bid for the bank seven years after he led a controversial \u00a3747m buyout of Northern Rock \u2013 later rebranded Virgin \u2013 following its taxpayer rescue. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG), which has proposed the deal,said it would create \u201ca genuine alternative to the large incumbent banks\u201d. The enlarged group would have 6 million customers. Virgin Money shares climbed more than 9% to 341p on news of the CYBG approach, but a rise in the shares over recent days could interest City watchdogs. The shares climbed 15% from 270p to 312p last week. Banking analysts said the deal would present \u201ccompelling industrial logic\u201d. It would bring together a more traditional bank, CYBG, which has 169 branches, mostly in Scotland and Yorkshire, and serves 2.8m commercial and personal customers, with Virgin Money\u2019s strong brand in mortgages and credit cards business, which has 3.3m customers. Virgin Money has not yet agreed to the deal, which it described as a preliminary proposal, but its shares jumped 9% when the news emerged. Virgin Money shareholders would have 36.5% of the combined group. Virgin Money traces its origins back to the 1995 launch of Virgin Direct, an investment business, but it was the takeover of Northern Rock in 2011 that propelled it into a large-scale operation. As chancellor, George Osborne agreed to sell Northern Rock to Virgin Money nearly four years after nationalising the bank at the height of the financial crisis. The price paid by a consortium of investors, led by Branson, was half the amount the UK taxpayer had injected into bank. Osborne said at the time that the deal represented value for money for UK taxpayers. Branson\u2019s consortium included the US billionaire, Wilbur Ross, now Donald Trump\u2019s commerce secretary. It bought the \u201cgood\u201d half of the bank, including its branch network, funded by retail deposits. The \u201cbad\u201d part of Northern Rock \u2013 which included its fabled 125% mortgages \u2013 remained in public hands, although defaults and losses have been much lower than anticipated. The coalition government brushed off calls by MPs, led by Chuka Ummuna, to remutualise the bank. Virgin Money said in a statement: \u201cThe board of Virgin Money is in the process of reviewing this proposal. There can be no certainty either that an offer will be made nor as to the terms of any offer, if made.\u201d Shares in other mid-sized \u201cchallenger\u201d banks rose sharply after CYBG\u2019s prompted speculation that a long-awaited consolidation in the sector could become a reality. Virgin Money\u2019s rivals, including Metro Bank and OnesavingsBank, rose as investors bet on which might be next to merge in a buoyant British mergers and acquisitions market which has had record levels of activity. Analysts said the initial offer was too low and would likely be rejected. \u201cWe think Virgin shareholders will be lukewarm on the proposal,\u201d said John Cronin at the broker Goodbody, adding that he expected a protracted takeover battle as the two parties jockey over price. Under Takeover Panel rules CYBG now has until 4 June to table a formal proposal or walk away for at least six months.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Self-employed couriers working for the gig-economy delivery firm DPD will receive a guaranteed minimum wage of \u00a38.75 an hour, as part of reforms following the death of a self-employed driver who missed hospital appointments because of the need to keep working or be charged. The proposal is thought to be the first of its kind by a major firm using self-employed gig workers in a system which has previously transferred most of the risk of achieving steady earnings on to workers who have been paid per delivery. The minimum rate will be \u00a310.20 an hour in London and each self-employed driver will have their earnings and hours assessed quarterly by independent auditors. DPD has claimed it is setting \u201ca benchmark for the industry\u201d. Other courier and transport firms \u2013 including Hermes, Deliveroo and Uber \u2013 rely on self-employed workers whose take home pay depends on the number of jobs they do each day. Investigations have suggested that some people working in this way earn well below the national minimum wage \u2013 currently \u00a37.83 an hour for over-25s. DPD makes deliveries for Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis, which had both voiced concern over its use of labour after Don Lane\u2019s death was reported by the Guardian. It confirmed it is scrapping \u00a3150 per day charges to drivers who miss work without finding a replacement. Lane, 53, collapsed and died in January after he missed hospital appointments to treat his diabetes, having been fined \u00a3150 when he did go to hospital. His death sparked anger in the Commons. Labour described it as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and the business secretary, Greg Clark, called it \u201ca terrible tragedy\u201d. DPD\u2019s move came as the Resolution Foundation\u2019s intergenerational commission reported that the growth in self-employed work has underpinned weak earnings growth, particularly among millennials. It found the proportion of young people without degrees in self-employment has risen sharply, accounting for 15% of working 35-year-olds. There are an estimated 1.1 million people working in the gig economy in the UK and there has been a string of employment tribunal cases in which gig workers \u2013 including for Uber and City Sprint \u2013 have successfully claimed that they were in bogus self-employment and should in fact be treated as workers and given the minimum wage, holiday pay and other rights. The government is considering possible legislation to make it easier for both the workforce and businesses to understand whether someone is an employee or self-employed. The move also comes as the government announced increased financial penalties for employers who break laws protecting low paid workers. It said it will hold leading brands jointly responsible for non-compliance in their supply chains by naming and shaming those which fail to correct non-compliance. Dwain McDonald, CEO of DPD, claimed the new driver code was a \u201ccomplete reappraisal of every aspect of our driver package\u201d. It will also give drivers the opportunity to have worker status, which means they will get a steady wage, sick pay, 28 days\u2019 holiday and a pension. DPD said the average annual salary under those terms would be \u00a328,800 and that drivers would not bear the costs of renting and insuring their vans as they currently do. \u201cOur aim is simple \u2013 to make DPD the carrier of choice for delivery drivers and for our drivers to be the best rewarded in the industry,\u201d McDonald said. But a trade union representing some of DPD\u2019s 5,000 drivers voiced caution. Calne Waterson, regional organiser for GMB Scotland, said that after DPD first announced the \u00a3150 charge would be scrapped in March, it continued in some places with one of his members being charged \u00a3300 for two days\u2019 missed work only last month. \u201cIt sounds good, but the promise to scrap fines sounded good too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will believe it when we see it.\u201d He also criticised DPD for communicating the new deals through the press rather than directly with drivers or unions. DPD declined to comment on whether it would be changing the amount it pays couriers per delivery in order to fund the changes. It said these were commercially sensitive.",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison began his budget speech by asking some rhetorical questions, which is generally a poor way to begin a speech, but I guess it\u2019s better than breaking out laughing, which he must be sorely tempted to do given the amount of tax revenue he has to play with. Last year I noted that \u201cthis budget will put to bed the argument that the only way to return to surplus is by cutting spending\u201d. Of course that old line continued to be pushed \u2013 the need to crack down on welfare cheats still gets a few headlines \u2013 but as has always been the case, the path back to a balanced budget, and even a surplus, lies with increased revenue. Goodbye revenue problem This budget sees the decade-long trough of revenue come to an end. Throughout the Howard years, revenue averaged 25.1% of GDP. That gorgeous run of good fortune was something Wayne Swan and the Labor party never experienced \u2013 the best they had was 23.3% of GDP in 2008-09. And let\u2019s put to bed the idea that this was because the Howard government was high-taxing and the ALP was low taxing. It was because the Howard government had the mining boom shovelling in tax revenue whereas the ALP had the worldwide recession that followed the global financial crisis. To give it some context, in 2019-20 when estimates tell us the budget will be in a sliver thin surplus of $2bn (really more a balanced budget than a surplus), revenue is expected to hit 25.3% of GDP. Had we had that level of revenue during the ALP government years, the only year in deficit would have been in 2009-10 \u2013 every other year, Swan would have been announcing a budget surplus. From this year on, over the next four years, the budget predicts revenue will grow by an average of 6.2% \u2013 almost double the average revenue growth during the ALP government and that experienced by Joe Hockey: When things are going well revenue improves, when the economy is in the toilet, it falls. Right now, things around the world are improving, so much so that things are looking better than Treasury expected just five months ago when it did the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook. The Treasury is expecting to get an extra $25.9bn in revenue over four years than it was anticipating in December\u2019s Myefo. That is broken down as $8bn in 2018-19, $5.87bn in 2019-20, $4.9bn in 2020-21, and a nice $7.2bn cherry in 2021-22. The largest contribution comes from income tax due to better than expected employment growth, and \u201cmining profitability, as a result of higher commodity prices\u201d. Company tax is expected to grow by a stunning $15bn this year \u2013 up 22%, the biggest annual growth of company tax this century. The budget is also pretty optimistic about personal income tax growing strongly \u2013 averaging 6.3% growth over the next four years. And that is even with the increase in the low-income tax offset: It means that personal income tax will continue to account for around half of all taxation \u2013 significantly more than was the case before the GFC: The government also suggests that cracking down on illicit tobacco sales will bring in $35bn worth of savings over the next four years. Which is one of those \u2018don\u2019t come back in four years and ask us to prove it but we\u2019re going to bank it now\u2019, measures. Never fear, that wages breakout is on its way! Last year the budget had some rather heroic predictions about wages growth. It predicted that by June next year wages would be growing at 3% (currently they\u2019re growing at 2.1%). In the Myefo, that was revised that down to 2.75%, and the government has kept it there, but in the following year they still expect it to rise to 3.25% and then up to 3.5% by June 2021. And that nice upsurge in wages \u2013 where we see wages growing at a pace they have not grown at since 2012 \u2013 is in spite of the budget also predicting employment growth will actually slow: The government does expect unemployment to fall, but not by much until 2021-22 at which point even though it expects the unemployment rate to fall from 5.25% to 5.0%, it does not expect wage growth to increase. That is a bit odd and makes for a rather bizarre picture when we compare unemployment and wages growth: Essentially, the government thinks wages growth will return to normal, but the past few years both here and overseas suggest that is a very hopeful view to take. Last year the budget was saved because employment grew faster than expected which cancelled out the weaker than expected wages growth. Should wages growth not return as fast as the government hope, they\u2019ll need employment growth to rescue them again. Hello Middle Australia, nice to see you. Finally, this year the government has discovered that most Australians earn less than $87,000. The increase in the low income tax offset will mostly affect those around the median taxable income of $55,000. But Morrison continues to play fast and loose with reality when he talks about who will benefit and by how much. In his speech, Morrison noted that \u201cfor middle income households with both parents working on average wages, this will boost their \u2018kitchen table\u2019 budget by more than $1,000 every year\u201d. But the problem is this: while the average wage of around $62,000 is close to the median earnings, a household with two people earning that amount is well above that level. The government also seems desperate to continue the furphy that someone on average full-time earnings is somehow a special representative of middle Australia, and must be protected from having any part of their income taxed at 37%. The current average full-time total earnings is $84,667 \u2013 and yet mostly we are talking about men. The average full-time earnings for women is currently just $74,245. But even here we\u2019re not even talking most full-time workers. The median full-time annual earnings is just $65,580 \u2013 which means their income would need to grow by a third before they would hit the old 37% tax threshold of $87,000, let alone the new one of $90,000. As it is, if you earn more than $87,000 you make more than 86% of women and 73% of men: The biggest tax cuts are set to occur in the years beyond which the budget has to pay for them. From July 2022 the government plans to take us down the flat tax path \u2013 wherein they will first raise the 32% tax threshold from $37,000 to $41,000 and then in July 2024 seek to abolish the 37% tax rate for those earning over $90,000. This would see people earning between $41,000 and $200,000 being taxed at the same rate of just 32%. Such a plan is so far off into the distance that the costings would not even have to be included until the May 2021 budget. Such a far-off plan is no surprise given it would cost an absolute motza (and benefit mostly those earning over $90,000) and it would also require government spending to be slashed to account for the drop in revenue \u2013 or other taxes such as the GST would need to be raised. Either way it would see a massive change in the role of government in both reducing inequality and providing services. This budget does not do that \u2013 it\u2019s about as nice a budget as you could expect, but just as the 2014 budget forecast horror cuts in future years, so too does Morrison\u2019s desires for flatter tax highlight a desire for a horror cuts to return \u2013 but at such a time that means they will not have to tell voters at the next election where those cuts will come from.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s competition watchdog has opened a full-scale investigation into the proposed merger of \u201cbig six\u201d energy firms npower and SSE. The announcement by the Competition and Markets Authority comes after it warned last month that the merger could lead to higher energy bills for households. The CMA said the two companies did not put forward evidence to address its concerns, meaning they now face a more detailed investigation which could take about six months. UK-listed SSE is the second largest of the big six by customer numbers, and Germany\u2019s npower is the smallest, but together they would be nearly the same size as British Gas, the market leader. The merger of the companies was announced last year, in the face of increasingly stiff competition from new challengers. There are now about 60 energy suppliers in the UK. Npower and SSE believe the new company, in which SSE will hive off its supply business but remain in energy networks and power generation, will be more focused, more agile and have the economies of scale to offer competitive deals. The new firm will be headed by the former Dixons Carphone UK chief executive Katie Bickerstaffe, who has promised a more innovative and efficient energy supplier. Consumer groups welcomed the CMA\u2019s scrutiny of the deal and its potential impact on consumers, noting that both firms scored badly in customer service rankings. Alex Neill, the managing director of home products and services at Which?, said: \u201cMergers of big players in essential markets such as energy risk reducing competition and harming consumers.\u201d The companies appear to have factored in the likelihood of a deeper, six-month investigation, as they have always said the merger would likely complete in the final three months of 2018, or the start of 2019. An npower spokesperson said: \u201cWe look forward to helping the CMA in its in-depth investigation of our merger with SSE\u2019s retail and energy services business throughout the phase two process. \u201cWe did not put forward measures to address the CMA\u2019s concerns because we firmly believe this merger will be good for competition as it stands.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender has dismissed fears that the UK housing market is heading for a crash despite posting news of the biggest monthly drop in prices since shortly after David Cameron became prime minister. Reporting on a month that traditionally marks the start of the spring house-buying season, Halifax said prices were down 3.1%, the steepest fall since September 2010. The decline \u2013 which followed a 1.6% rise in March \u2013 meant the cost of the average home in the UK was cut by \u00a37,140 to \u00a3220,962. Over the latest quarter \u2013 considered a better guide to the underlying trend \u2013 prices were 0.1% lower than in the previous three months. Russell Galley, Halifax\u2019s managing director, said demand for property had been weak in recent months. However, he still expected annual house price inflation to be between zero and 3% this year. In the three months to April, prices were up 2.2% on February to April 2017, down from 2.7% in the three months to March. Previous sustained falls in house prices have tended to occur only when rising unemployment forces people to sell their homes, but Galley said the UK jobs\u2019 market remained strong. Unemployment is at its lowest level since 1975 and real wage growth has resumed. Values dipped across the UK for the third quarter in a row, falling 0.1% between February and April, compared with declines of 0.1% and 0.7% in the two previous three-month periods, according to Halifax. The lender said both the quarterly and annual rates had fallen since reaching a peak last autumn. City analysts say the monthly Halifax figures tend to be more volatile than other surveys. House prices have been falling in London for some time, especially in wealthier areas, while values in areas outside the capital are still rising. Recent regional figures from Halifax showed the price of a typical house in London was \u00a3430,749 between January and March, the lowest since the end of 2015. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, said the latest figures were disappointing. \u201cWe are entering what is supposed to be the busy spring buying season, which tends to set the tone for the rest of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cMore recently, activity and listings have picked up but we are finding the market still quite sensitive and only those prepared to negotiate hard are moving on.\u201d Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \u201cLooking ahead, consumers\u2019 low confidence and modest rises in mortgage rates suggest that demand will continue to weaken. \u201cPrices will fall rapidly, though, only when a large proportion of homeowners are forced to sell up. With unemployment and borrowing costs low and credit freely available, few people are being forced to sell their homes quickly. A period of broadly flat house prices, therefore, remains the most likely outcome.\u201d",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Shire, the London-listed maker of treatments for ADHD and rare diseases, has finally agreed to a takeover by the Japanese firm Takeda after it raised its offer to \u00a346bn, making it the biggest deal in the pharmaceutical sector since 2000. After being rebuffed four times, Takeda secured a recommendation from the Shire board by raising the amount of cash in its offer to $30.33 (\u00a322.43) a share. Shire shareholders will also receive 0.839 new Takeda shares for each share. That makes the offer worth \u00a349.01 a share, about \u00a35 more than Takeda\u2019s initial bid in late March. Shares in the FTSE 100 company rose by nearly 5% to \u00a340.34 butremained well below the offer price, indicating that Shire shareholders have reservations about the deal. There are also concerns that the move will overstretch Takeda\u2019s finances. Its shares have lost nearly a fifth of their value since it revealed its interest in Shire. Takeda\u2019s chief executive, Christophe Weber, is heading to London next week to explain the deal to shareholders. It needs support from 75% of Shire shareholders and two-thirds of Takeda investors to succeed. Takeda, which was founded in Osaka in 1781, has set aside $9.1m for retention bonuses, which will double the pay and bonuses for Shire\u2019s chief executive, Flemming \u00d8rnskov, and its finance chief, Thomas Dittrich, who are staying on until the deal completes, which is expected to happen by mid-2019. It will be the biggest overseas acquisition by a Japanese company, giving Takeda Shire\u2019s lucrative rare diseases portfolio and a larger presence in the US. The deal is expected to generate cost savings of at least $1.4bn (\u00a31bn), 43% of which is expected to come from combining the two firms\u2019 research and development operations, in particular the early stage pipelines. There may be a 6-7% cut in the total workforce of 52,000, Weber indicated, representing up to 3,640 jobs. The bulk of the job cuts will affect sales and administration. Shire employs 300 people in the UK at a sales office in Paddington. \u00d8rnskov said the deal was in the best interests of shareholders and offered \u201can opportunity to improve the lives of even more patients globally with rare and highly specialised conditions\u201d. Shire investors will own about half of the combined group, which will be listed on the Tokyo stock exchange. As many as three Shire directors will join the Takeda board. Shire was founded above a shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, in 1986 and makes the ADHD drugs Adderall and Vyvanse, and the dry eye disease treatment Xiidra as well as treatments for rare diseases. The company is based in Dublin for tax purposes but is run from Boston where it also has most of its laboratories. It came close to being taken over by the US drugmaker AbbVie in 2014, but the deal was scuppered by a clampdown on tax inversions, through which US companies bought overseas businesses to secure a lower tax rate. Shire went on to acquire the US company Baxalta with its haemophilia portfolio for \u00a324.7bn in 2016.",
