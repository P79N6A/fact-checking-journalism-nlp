      "bodyText": "The bitter legal spat between Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) and its erstwhile director, Sir Paul Judge, intensified yet again on Wednesday when the City grandee claimed the Kazakh miner had used \"dirty tricks\" to entrap him, as well as hacking his email and telephone. The allegations were made in Judge's response to an earlier claim filed by ENRC, in which the mining firm published what it said were transcripts of conversations showing its former director leaking confidential company information. Judge, who is a sheriff of the City of London and potentially a future lord mayor of London, had previously denied he was party to the discussions. However, in new court papers the businessman now admits the conversations took place, but says that he was speaking to an individual claiming to be a journalist, who was in fact \"acting on behalf of [ENRC] and/or individuals associated with [ENRC]\". ENRC denies employing the journalist. Judge further alleges the journalist was \"attempting to entrap [him] into making statements which could be used against him \u2026 [he] therefore made statements in the belief that they would \u2026 be conveyed back to those instructing [the journalist]\". The defence states that Judge believed his actions would expose the company's \"dirty tricks\" by revealing it to \"a larger audience of individuals within [ENRC]\". He also says that the company was hacking his email and telephone. The account is the latest salvo in ENRC's lawsuit against Judge, which alleges he deliberately disclosed confidential company information to the media. Judge has filed a counter claim denying the accusation and accusing the mining firm of libel. ENRC, whose businesses are currently being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), rose to become a member of the FTSE 100, but its shares crashed after numerous allegations were made about the firm. The group delisted its shares from the stock exchange on Monday. In the wake of recent controversies involving controlling shareholders in ENRC and Bumi \u2013 an Indonesian miner \u2013 new stock market rules are being brought in to protect minority investors in major companies. After a year-long consultation, the Financial Conduct Authority has strengthened the listing regulations for major companies to give minority shareholders additional voting rights and greater influence over key decisions. But the regulator has stopped short of demanding an increase in the free float \u2013 the amount of shares available to trade \u2013 from the current 25%.",

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland's new boss admitted on Wednesday night that the reputation of the bailed-out institution has been seriously damaged by allegations that it is deliberately wrecking small businesses in pursuit of profit. But Ross McEwan, who started as chief executive last month, fought back against the claims made by Lawrence Tomlinson, an adviser to business secretary Vince Cable. The allegations against the 81%-taxpayer owned bank, in a report published on Monday, have prompted the interest of City regulators and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). McEwan said the bank had not received any evidence of a systematic effort to make money from customers by pushing them into its turnaround division, known as the global restructuring group (GRG). Pledging a full investigation by law firm Clifford Chance, McEwan said: \"It is important to note that the most serious allegation that has been made is that RBS conducted a 'systematic' effort to profit on the back of our customers when they were in financial distress. \"We do not believe that this is the case, but it has nonetheless done serious damage to RBS's reputation.

      "bodyText": "Tesco is preparing to offer same-day delivery for online groceries as it fights to shore up its struggling UK business and take on rival services by Waitrose, Morrisons and Asda. The move would see the UK's biggest online grocer competing with Ocado, the company which delivers Waitrose groceries and is set to offer the same service for Morrisons shoppers in Warwickshire early next year. Bigger rival Asda is also planning to introduce same-day grocery deliveries next year. Tesco is already trialling same-day deliveries of food in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, under which shoppers can order goods by midday for delivery by 6pm. Simon Belsham, managing director of grocery home shopping, said: \"The trial is working successfully and we are looking to roll that out further.\" The news emerged as Tesco opened a 120,000 sq ft centre near Erith, south east London, its sixth dedicated online distribution centre for food. The supermarket uses the \"dark stores\" \u2013 so called because they are not open to the public \u2013 in addition to picking groceries for online shoppers from 300 stores. Belsham said Tesco, which controls 47.5% of all online grocery sales in the UK, needed to build capacity because online sales were growing faster in London than elsewhere. Tesco continues to increase market share online, despite losing ground in its stores. A flurry of notes from City analysts earlier this week suggested the supermarket was set to reveal another set of poor underlying sales next week, putting pressure on boss Phil Clarke, who is trying to turn the business around. The Erith centre, which will be able to process up to 4,000 orders a day when it is running at full capacity, uses hi-tech warehouse technology to enable it to offer 30,000 different items, 50% more than the average store and 16% more than the five other dark stores. Belsham said that would allow Tesco to offer more specialist ethnic foods and upmarket lines helping it to appeal to a broader range of shoppers in London. Meanwhile Tesco is also piloting a collection service at its small Express stores for groceries ordered online. The service is run out of a Tesco delivery van parked behind stores in Datchet and Harrow. Belsham said that combining stores and online services was an important part of Tesco's future.",

      "bodyText": "Npower is to close offices and outsource work to India in a move that will see 1,400 UK staff lose their jobs at the energy supplier. The announcement is expected to intensify public anger around the activities of the Big Six power companies and raise the political heat in Westminster where energy has risen to the top of the political agenda. Trade unions accused npower of serving up a \"Christmas nightmare\" by planning to offshore 1,400 jobs to India and transfer a further 570 to another British firm, probably Capita. It is understood that frontline call-centre operations will be outsourced to a third party in the UK, with back-office work moved to India. Union leaders warned the moves would backfire and further tarnish the reputation of npower which came bottom for customer service in a recent survey and which told a parliamentary committee earlier this year that it had paid almost no corporation tax for three years. Npower, the energy supplier of Germany's RWE, hit gas and electricity customers with a 10.4% rise in fuel bills earlier this month and its central London offices were the target of fuel poverty demonstrations earlier this week. The company declined to comment on the planned office and staff cuts but well-informed sources told the Guardian that npower staff would be informed of the changes at 9am on Thursday. Npower said in a statement: \"As we announced a couple of months ago, npower has been undertaking a major review of sites, operations and people across the UK. \"We've been doing this to improve our customer service and keep our costs down, at a time of external pressures on customers' bills. As we've always said, we'll tell our people first and then inform the media,\" it added. Npower and the other big six firms such as SSE and Centrica insist that they are having to raise domestic bills and trim their costs in a bid to counter the impact of rising wholesale prices and green levies for home insulation. Npower's parent RWE said earlier this month that 6,750 jobs would need to be cut across Europe as it tries to reduce a debt mountain of over \u00a328bn, partly caused by the Berlin government's decision to phase out nuclear power stations.

      "bodyText": "The business select committee, after its third attempt to solve the mystery of Royal Mail's post-flotation soaraway share price, cannot claim to have uncovered a killer fact. Wednesday's session ran to the now-familiar script. Ministers, supported by their advisers, insisted that 330p was the correct clearing price for 600m shares. They emphasised the risks to the business, such as a strike and the lack of a pay deal. They said institutional buyers would have evaporated if pricing had been pushed harder. They pointed to the arrival of two enthusiasts for the shares \u2013 TCI, a hedge fund, and GIC, the Singapore wealth fund \u2013 in a thin market. And business secretary Vince Cable stood by his \"froth\" remarks, arguing that perspective (anything between three months and two years, apparently) is required to judge real value. The official account, it has to be said, carries internal logic. One can see how and why decisions were made at every stage. Yet the share price still stands above 550p, valuing Royal Mail at \u00a32bn more than the price at which the government sold 60%. What happened? Aside from the TCI factor (undoubtedly real), two elements may have been under-explored so far. First, the flotation roadshow was conducted under a gloomy cloud. Unlike most flotations, where advisers tend to shout about their wondrous potential of their clients' business, the build-up to the sale of Royal Mail was all about the risks. Quarrelsome relations with the Communication Workers Union were mentioned time and again. The transforming effect of the new regulatory regime, allowing Royal Mail greater freedom to set the price of stamps, hardly got a look-in. One could argue that the government was obliged to err on the gloomy side because the unwritten rule of privatisations is that no retail investor must be hurt. Even so, the pace at which Royal Mail, for all its day-to-day challenges, is generating cash in the new regulatory world is striking. Wednesday's half-year numbers showed net debt reduced by \u00a3183m to \u00a3723m between March and September. And that's before the benefit of refinancing the debt at 3.5%, rather than the 8% being charged by government, kicks in. Some analysts think Royal Mail will show net cash in three years' time. The second is related: was the initial dividend of \u00a3133m, or \u00a3200m (20p-a-share) on an annualised basis, set too conservatively? Again, one can understand why Royal Mail would wish to start cautiously. There is a long road ahead to modernise operations, especially on the parcels side. The rate of decline in the volumes of letters is unpredictable, and could accelerate. Strikes could still happen. Even so, note Barclays' forecast for the rate of dividend increase \u2013 23% a year, compound, for three years. So 28p-a-share next year, followed by 33p, and then 37p. In other words, investors were being offered a 6% yield at the flotation price, with the possibility of a near-doubling of the dividend by March 2016. Those dividend increases are not guaranteed \u2013 obviously. But the chance of success amounts to a strong entry on the \"reward\" side of the risk/reward ledger. None of which is to deny that 565p, wednesday's share price, carries a strong whiff of irrational exuberance, to use the phrase Cable borrowed. But, come on, the shares could surely have been sold close to 400p if the government had not so obviously painted itself as a frustrated seller and if Moya Greene, Royal Mail's chief executive, could have been prodded to be a tad more aggressive with her initial dividend.",

While the Dutch were selling single tulip bulbs for 10 times a craftsman's annual income, the British were panicking about their own economic crisis.

The economy was taking on the features of a modern capitalist state, and the currency simply couldn't catch up.</p> <p>Describing the problem Britain faced then, David Birch, a consultant specialising in electronic transactions, says: \"We had a problem in matching the nature of the economy to the nature of the money we used.\" Birch has been talking about electronic money for over two decades and is convinced that we find ourselves on the edge of the same shift that occurred 400 years ago.</p> <p>The cause of that shift is the internet, because even though you might want to, you can't use cash \u2013 untraceable, no-fee-charged cash \u2013 online. Existing payment systems such as PayPal and credit cards demand a cut. So for individuals looking for a digital equivalent of cash \u2013 no middleman, quick, easy \u2013 Bitcoin looks pretty good.</p> <p>In 1613, as people looked for a replacement for silver, Birch says, \"we might have been saying 'the idea of tulip bulbs as an asset class looks pretty good, but this central bank nonsense will never catch on.' We knew we needed a change, but we couldn't tell which made sense.\" Back then, the currency crisis was solved with the introduction first of Isaac Newton's Royal Mint (\"official\" silver and gold) and later with the creation of the Bank of England (\"official\" paper money that could in theory be swapped for official silver or gold).</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/25/is-bitcoin-about-to-change-the-world-peer-to-peer-cryptocurrency-virtual-wallet\"><strong>Is Bitcoin about to change the world?</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/iansteadman/statuses/405712316127526912\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexhern\">@alexhern</a> &quot;Meanwhile, the Hern Bitcoin Investment Regret Index has dropped to new lows.&quot;</p>&mdash; Ian Steadman (@iansteadman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/iansteadman/statuses/405712316127526912\">November 27, 2013</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-529600eee4b0ae67c83cca05\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2013-11-27T14:52:42.769Z\">2.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lagarde List journalist vows to keep fighting corruption</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-97cd71a6-031d-4048-8f9a-b69935529815\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/27/1385563060474/f593df21-bfae-4f1e-8cf2-60c6c7fccfce-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek journalist Costas Vaxevanis, pictured at a court house in Athens during his trial.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek journalist Kostas Vaxevanis, pictured at a court house in Athens during his trial.

Simon Goodley reports that this will include hedge funds who have bought shares since the IPO (and who helped to push the share price up over 70%) Royal Mail investors who bought large stakes in the postal service following its \u00a33.3bn privatisation last month are to be asked by MPs why they have staked hundreds of millions of pounds on the view that the government sold the firm on the cheap. The news emerged after the Commons business committee investigating the Royal Mail flotation questioned the business secretary,Vince Cable, and his ministerial colleague Michael Fallon how the offer was valued, prompting an assertion from Cable that there was no need for an independent inquiry into the process. Committee chairman Adrian Bailey said he will be writing to the The Children's Investment Fund (TCI) and GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, which have built up their Royal Mail stakes since its listing to more than 6% and 4%, respectively \u2013 having decided the shares would rise far above their 330p flotation price.

GW In the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland has announced that law firm Clifford Chance will report back by the end of January on how distressed small firms were treated by its Global Restructuring Group (GRG) Chief executive Ross McEwan admitted that the \"serious allegations\" made against RBS in recent days had hurt the bank, adding that he does not believe RBS deliberately drive small firms into the ground. McEwan said: \"It is important to note that the most serious allegation that has been made is that RBS conducted a 'systematic' effort to profit on the back of our customers when they were in financial distress. We do not believe that this is the case, but it has nonetheless done serious damage to RBS's reputation. No evidence has been provided for that allegation to the bank. The review will investigate the claim fully and I will report back on its findings. \u201cThe news of recent days doesn\u2019t reflect the great work people across RBS do to support our customers every day. It is vital that we enjoy the trust of our customers and I cannot allow these allegations to undermine that trust.\u201d RBS said that Clifford Chance will conduct the review, into issues raised by the Tomlinson Report , on \"an independent basis, it will be lead by a regulatory partner within the firm and with a team that has had no previous dealings with GRG matters\". Silvio Berlusconi has just suffered the heaviest blow of his political career, writes Lizzy Davies from Italy, after being kicked out of the Senate following his tax fraud conviction. A hostile front of the centre-left and anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) voted against the former prime minister, who pulled his Forza Italia party from Enrico Letta's governing coalition and into opposition on Tuesday. Berlusconi was not present for the Senate vote. But shortly before the chamber approved his expulsion he gave a defiant address to supporters outside his residence in central Rome, declaring that he would remain on the political scene. Berlusconi, who resigned as PM in late 2011 amid concerns over Italy's growing financial instability, received his first definitive conviction in 20 years of legal battles on 1 August. He was sentenced to four years in prison, commuted to one year of community service. More here: Silvio Berlusconi ousted from Italian parliament after tax fraud conviction The Italian Senate has voted to strip Silvio Berlusconi of his Senate seat, with immediate effect. It may not be the end of his political life -- given his seemingly indestructible appeal to sections of the Italian population. But it's an ignominious moment in the long career of Berlusconi, and the large crowds of supporters who took to the streets of Rome won't like it.... As explained this morning, Berlusconi officially pulled his support for the country's coalition government last night. But with his centre-right party having split, this did not bring prime minister Enrico Letta down. Royal Mail shares have closed for the day, up 6% at 565p, as the City gives a thumbs-up to the news that profits doubled in the last six months. Well worth checking this out... Classic Berlusconi.... Heads up - Silvio Berlusconi is addressing his supporters in Rome as the vote over his parliamentary expulsion looms. It's being streamed live here, on Reuters (they're doing a special liveblog for the occasion). Berlusconi is saying that today is a \"bitter day of mourning\" for Italian democracy, and accusing prosecutors of following the \"judicial path to socialism\". Back to Royal Mail, and shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna makes an important point about this morning's decent financial results - they were achieved under state ownership. He writes: Royal Mail\u2019s profits doubled in the first half of this year before privatisation, demolishing the Government\u2019s case for its fire sale of Royal Mail, which rest on a claim it couldn\u2019t succeed in public hands and needed to be privatised for investment to take place. Out-of-touch Ministers, who will only stand up for a privileged few, have nationalised the debt of Royal Mail and privatised the profit. Vince Cable and David Cameron are in denial about the real concern that taxpayers have been left short changed to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds by their botched Royal Mail privatisation, at a time when many are struggling with a cost of living crisis of the Government\u2019s making. Umunna also isn't accepting the business secretary's line that Royal Mail's share price is still settling: Vince Cable says he will look at the share price in a matter of months or years, but the key issue is what price the Government could have secured when it floated the company on 11 October this year.\u201d Crowds are gathering in Rome as senators prepare to vote on whether Silvio Berlusconi should be expelled from the senate -- as appears inevitable -- over his tax fraud conviction. In virtual currency news, Bitcoin just hit the $1,000 mark for the first time ever. Perhaps. But as my colleague Alex Hern explained on Monday, there are sound reasons to take peer-to-peer, distributed currencies extremely seriously (even if Bitcoin's rapidly fluctuating valuation suggests we're into serious bubble mania) History does provide some lessons. While the Dutch were selling single tulip bulbs for 10 times a craftsman's annual income, the British were panicking about their own economic crisis. The silver coinage that had been the basis of the national economy for centuries was rapidly becoming unfit for purpose: it was constrained in supply and too easy to forge. The economy was taking on the features of a modern capitalist state, and the currency simply couldn't catch up. Describing the problem Britain faced then, David Birch, a consultant specialising in electronic transactions, says: \"We had a problem in matching the nature of the economy to the nature of the money we used.\" Birch has been talking about electronic money for over two decades and is convinced that we find ourselves on the edge of the same shift that occurred 400 years ago. The cause of that shift is the internet, because even though you might want to, you can't use cash \u2013 untraceable, no-fee-charged cash \u2013 online. Existing payment systems such as PayPal and credit cards demand a cut. So for individuals looking for a digital equivalent of cash \u2013 no middleman, quick, easy \u2013 Bitcoin looks pretty good. In 1613, as people looked for a replacement for silver, Birch says, \"we might have been saying 'the idea of tulip bulbs as an asset class looks pretty good, but this central bank nonsense will never catch on.' We knew we needed a change, but we couldn't tell which made sense.\" Back then, the currency crisis was solved with the introduction first of Isaac Newton's Royal Mint (\"official\" silver and gold) and later with the creation of the Bank of England (\"official\" paper money that could in theory be swapped for official silver or gold). Is Bitcoin about to change the world? Greek investigative journalist Kostas Vaxevanis has vowed to keep exposing corruption in the country, after being acquitted of breaking privacy laws over the publication of the infamous Lagarde list of suspected tax evaders. Standing in Athens' Evripidon court complex, he told our correspondent Helena Smith that he was \"overjoyed\" by today's verdict - which she says is still being written up. \"It's a terrific decision, a great day for press freedom,\u201d said the 47-year-old editor who published the list in his bi-monthly investigative magazine Hot Doc 13 months ago. \u201cOur opponents wanted a cover up. They wanted to cover up the system of corruption and vested interests that governs Greece. We will go on revealing the truth. All the rest is public relations,\" he told Helena, quoting Orwell. The public prosecutor, Evangelos Ioannidis, had argued that Vaxevanis should be found guilty of breaking privacy laws because he not only revealed the names of the 2,059 Greeks on the list but identified them by profession: \"If he had only published the names of public figures that would have been alright,\" he said. \"By naming them and identifying their professions he exposed them greatly.\" Helena continues: Regular readers will recall that the list was like a Who's Who of the country's elite with politicians, businessmen, oligarchs and shipping families among those revealed. Vaxevanis said: \"Instead of acting on the list, three government and two finance ministers sat on it precisely because they didn't want to take it further....It is a national disgrace that Greece is the only European country not to have made even a Euro (in reclaimed tax) when other EU states have raked in millions by pursuing people on similar lists.\" IMF chief Christine Lagarde, after whom the infamous tally is named, handed the list to her then Greek counterpart, finance minister Giorgos Papaconstantinou, in the hope that authorities in Athens would audit those on it. A Supreme Court prosecutor proposed last week that Papaconstantinou, the architect of debt-stricken Greece's first EU-IMF sponsored bailout, be tried for failing dereliction of duty in his handling of the list. The former socialist has denied accusations of tampering the list to remove the names of three of his relatives on it. Here's our full story on the OECD report into the Greek economy: OECD takes aim at Greek bureaucracy to boost growth In the markets, Italian shares are outperforming the rest of Europe as traders applaud Enrico Letta's government for winning a confidence vote over the 2014 budget last night. The FTSE MIB is up 1%, while Germany's DAX has gained a more modest 0.3% following the coalition deal agreed early this morning. Italy also saw its borrowing costs drop to the lowest since May, at an auction of six-month bonds this morning. No alarm, in other words, over the impending eviction of Silvio Berlusconi from the Senate. That vote comes later this afternoon - and as political expert Alberto Nardelli points out, the former PM still has his supporters. Mixed economic data from America to digest. Bad: Durable goods orders fell 2.0% month-on-month in October -- the month of the dreaded US government shutdown. That is even worse than expected. It fuels fears that firms held back on placing orders for expensive equipment while they waited to see if the US plunged into a catastrophic default. Transport orders were particularly weak, as AP explains: Demand for commercial aircraft plunged nearly 16 percent last month, accounting for much of the decline. But orders also fell 1.2 percent in a closely watched category that excludes volatile transportation and defence orders. Good: The number of new claims for jobless benefit made last week fell to 316,000, down from 326,000 in the previous seven days. The four-week average of new claims also improved, suggesting the labour market picked up pace. Sticking with Greece -- The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has called for a bonfire of outdated regulations imposed on Greek firms that, it says, are holding back growth and making firms uncompetitive. This includes allowing shops to offer \" buy-one-get-one-free deals\" and set their own product sell-by dates, says our economics correspondent Phillip Inman. The full report is online here. Phillip writes: The Paris-based think tank wants Greece to tackle 555 regulations hindering growth in the retail trade, food processing industry, building materials sector and tourism. It said the industries, which account for more than a fifth of the economy, would generate \u20ac5.2bn in extra activity once the measures were implemented. Kostis Hatzidakis, Greece\u2019s minister for development and competitiveness, said the while the Greek economy had stopped contracting, there was widespread agreement that the country\u2019s \u201cdwindling competitiveness\u201d was restricting the recovery. \u201cIt is true that our economy has been plagued by bureaucracy, protectionism and market distortions for a long time,\u201d he said. A shake-up of regulations would help firms become more efficient, Phillip explains: At the moment shops must gain clearance from public officials to offer discount deals. Sell-by dates on milk and other foodstuffs are also set by the Greek authorities. Among 329 recommendations, the OECD report said price restrictions also hampered competition in the tourism industry, which must submit cuts in nightly room charges to local public officials or trade associations. Licensing requirements that prevent new entrants to all four industries must be repealed to allow greater competition, it said. Some breaking news from Greece -- Costas Vaxevanis, the journalist who faced criminal charges for publishing the infamous \"Lagarde List\" of suspected tax evaders, has just been acquitted for the second time. That's hot off the press from our Athens correspondent, Helena Smith: Tax avoidance is a key issue for Greece, as it tries to hit its fiscal targets. Royal Mail's shares have not been dented by this morning's session. They're trading up 31p at 562p, a gain of 5.5% today. So, some entertaining blows were traded by both sides, but I don't think the government side were actually bowled out this morning -- indeed, they came back pretty strongly at the end. \u2022 The government simply refuses to accept that it sold Royal Mail too cheaply, despite the company's share price acting as a daily reminder that the postal operator is worth \u00a32bn more than it was floated for. The ministerial batting partnership of Cable and Fallon played a straight bat to claims that the investment banks diddled the government, and were aggressive in categorically disputing that taxpayers lost out. \u2022 Most of the BIS committee, though, appear to remain convinced that Royal Mail was simply sold too cheaply. Their concerns over the company's property assets (articulated by Katy Clark MP at several sessions) are a reminder that the verdict on whether the float is a success or a fiasco can't come for years. \u2022 Vince Cable rules out an inquiry, while Michael Fallon insisted that he was much happier to sit there and defend a rising share price, rather than a falling one. \u2022 Cable also told the committee that the government had 'interrogated' its advisors thoroughly. In the end, ministers took their view to sell at 330p. The claim that it was too risky to raise the price to 350p didn't appear to convince MPs, who pointed out that the float was massively oversubscribed. \u2022 However, Mark Russell, CEO of Shareholder Executive - the state body charged with managing the taxpayer's stakes - did concede that the scale of the share price rise since the float had surprised him. Russell said (at around 10.13am in this recording) that: \"We did not anticipate the share price to move to the extent that it did\". \u2022 Russell was also accused of \"a degree of gullibility\", after saying he still believed the investment banks advising the government had given good advice. \u2022 Goldman Sachs and UBS are going to have to wait for their \u00a34m of deferred fees. And, given a decision may not come until after the next election, they'd be wise not to bank on getting it. \u2022 Cable is sticking to his claim that the Royal Mail share price was \"frothy\", and defended the use of the Anglo-Saxon term. Some on the committee (rightly or wrongly) reckon froth should blow away in days not linger around for months. Citing Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller as proof that markets were irrational was a smart enough move by Cable -- it's a shame the committee didn't point out that Shiller shared the award with Eugene Fama, for his work on how markets are rational. Here's a clip of Vince Cable insisting that the Royal Mail IPO was handled well. The session ended with disagreement between committee chairman Adrian Bailey and Secretary of State Vince Cable. Disputing the defence presented by Cable, and Michael Fallon, Bailey summed up thus: The fact is, we were selling the shares now. The market price has been consistently high for a time, and the taxpayer did not obtain... the maximum benefit from it. That is the situation. Cable won't have a word of it. \"I just categorically refute your analysis, chairman\". The committee will now deliberate, and report back. Michael Fallon then insists that the Royal Mail was not sold too cheaply. He says: Let's be clear, we could not have got a higher price in October for the 600 million shares we were selling. That was made clear to us by our advisors. There were already investors walking away at that stage, he adds. He also takes Cable's argument that you can't compare today's share price, when just a million shares are changing hands each day, to the float price. Fallon cites the six analyst reports into Royal Mail published by City firms since the float. Three reckon the share price will be below \u00a35 in the medium term, one has a target price below \u00a34, and one has \"a range of 50p to 1000p\". Michael Fallon now give a clear, full-throated defence of the float - saying it protected the company's future. The taxpayer hasn't lost anything, the business minister insists with some vehemence. By floating Royal Mail, we have guaranteed the access to capital markets, and the responsible investors it needs. We have given it a commercial future, and spared the taxpayer \"the risk of having to bail it out\". Most people believe you have cost us money - so shouldn't we have an independent inquiry into the Royal Mail flotation, as John Major has suggested? Cable rules it out. \"Absolutely not\", he says. In the long term, people will come to realise that this was a \"successful\" and \"well-managed operation\", Cable claims. He also categorically refutes that taxpayers were short-changed. Lazard and Shareholder Executive took most of the early fire, but now it's Cable and Fallon firmly in the driving seat as the session comes to a conclusion. Another question on whether the investment bankers hired to help with the IPO stuck by the rules when they advised the government. Was it sensible to engage firms who would also profit from trading the stock? Cable replies that (as flagged up by Nadhim Zahawi earlier in the hearing), it would be a criminal offence for bankers to conspire to price Royal Mail too cheaply, in order to generate more commission once it had floated. We can't base government policy on the idea that we're dealing with criminals, he adds. Cable rejects the analogy that the government has effectively sold a house too cheaply, using two advisors who pocketed two lots of commission and then made money on the resale price. In an attempt to persuade the sceptical committee that the current share price should be taken as a value of the company, he compares daily trading to taking \"individual bricks\" out of the house and selling them separately. Bailey says this won't convince taxpayers. How much of a discount is acceptable in an IPO? Fallon argues that it's far better to see Royal Mail shares rise since the float, rather than fall ala Facebook. We knew there's be a discount. I'd feel far more uncomfortable if retail investors were sitting on a loss, Fallon adds. Anyone can sell a company too cheaply, minister, replies Adrian Bailey. Fallon also reminded the committee of the problems caused by the collapse of Railtrack, floated by a previous government. We didn't want a repeat of that. This is turning into quite a classic interrogation, with Cable trying to introduce Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller as a defence witness. Caroline Dinenage asks Cable whether he regrets calling the initial share price surge as \"froth\". Not at all, the Business secretary replies. I'm very happy to have used it. It's a good old Anglo-Saxon term. Taxpayers can think of a few other choice Anglo-Saxon terms to sum up this affair, interjects Adrian Bailey (please make your suggestions in the comments below). And when might the froth blow off, Dinenage inquires.What's Royal Mail really worth? Tricky thing, froth. Cable won't commit to when the 'real value' of Royal Mail will be clear, or what it might be. Bailey points out that the froth on a pint doesn't hang around for long (rather like a pint) -- it's been SIX WEEKS, Secretary of State. Cable, though, says markets are irrational - you can't use a share price to decide how much a listed company is worth. He then points to Robert Shiller's work on irrational markets, which he was recognised for this earlier this year. He also cited analyst predictions that postal operator share prices could tumble sharply in the next few years. In that case, Dinenage remarks, shouldn't we sell a few of our remaining shares now? Cable replies that the government isn't allowed to for several months. Why didn't the government hold off from floating the Royal Mail until a pay deal had been reached, rather than float it with the strike action hovering over it? Michael Fallon tried to pin the blame on the unions, saying they had no interest in a deal before the IPO and were determined to thwart it. A couple of days profit could have wiped out its profits for the year, he claims. Lazard estimates that a strike would cost \u00a330m per day. And Cable joins in the 'pin the blame on the union' game, saying that many investors involved in the 'global fishing assessment' conducted by Goldman and UBS that they were very worried about strike action. William Bain MP isn't convinced... asking whether the Treasury was consulted in this crucial point. Apparently they were kept informed and never argued. Vince Cable says the government could have raised more if had sold shares to anyone, rather than the long-term, responsible investors needed to protect the Royal Mail's future and guard the universal service obligation. The gloves are definitely off, with committee chair Adrian Bailey accusing Mark Russell of being somewhat gullible over his dealings with Goldman Sachs and UBS. Were the banks \"conning you\" by saying the Royal Mail wasn't worth more, Bailey asks? Russell says that he does not believe that they were, adding: We were satisfied that the advice we received from the banks was proper advise, and were acting in our best interest. And you're satisfied? Yes, Russell replies. Bailey hits back, telling Russell that he is displaying \"a degree of gullibility\" that is \"not consistent with your role\". The issue here is that \"Chinese Walls\" are meant to keep an investment bank's advisors away from the trading side. Nadhim Zahawi MP points out, for the record, that breaching those walls would probably be a criminal offence. MPs of all tribes on the committee continue to give the witnesses a tough time. Rebecca Harris, Conservative MP, asks for details of which banks threatened to walk away if the price was raised above 330p. Can we check if they've bought shares at higher prices? Cable says the details of who got what in the float will be handed to the National Audit Office. Committee chairman Adrian Bailey asks about the Guardian's report that Clifford Chance is now analysing Royal Mail's property portfolio. Further proof that the property assets are worth more than they were valued at? Mark Russell declines to comment. Onto Royal Mail's property assets - with Katy Clark MP asking whether taxpayers have been ripped off because the true value of the company's property up and down the country weren't really considered in the valuation process. Cable bats it over to Mark Russell. Russell explains that Shareholder Executive did get advisers to value three sites that were no longer needed. He claims that there is \"nothing significant that we're aware of\" beyond that, relating to spare property. Clark disputes this, pointing out that some analysts reckon the Royal Mail will have a lot of spare property which could be sold. Russell agrees that \"undoubtedly\" some people are taking a different view. And he then adds that \"over the next five to 10 years, I'm sure some of those sites could be developed\". Good stuff this - McKeckin now probes Cable about his claim that shares had been given to blue-chip long-term shareholders. Is this still the case? Cable says the government doesn't have the shareholder register, but reiterates that most of the shares went to the right sort of investors. Ann McKeckin asks why, given the apparent trickiness of floating Royal Mail, the government didn't sell less of it and maintain a majority stake. Cable claims that this would have been a quite different proposition for the market (and therefore would have been priced accordingly). Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi throws the witnesses a small lifeline -- quoting a research note from Hargreaves Lansdown which pointed out the many challenges that Royal Mail faces. Vince Cable grabs it gratefully -- yes indeed, it's hard to truly value a postal business in the current environment, says. Adrian Bailey won't have it -- the stock market has given a quite different view. Mark Russell of Shareholder Executive admits that he, and the government, has been surprised by the rise in Royal Mail shares. We did not anticipate the share price to move as much as it did....I don't think any of us anticipated the size of the jump. He does explain that he did expect shares to rise -- IPOs are usually priced for success, after all. Adrian Bailey moves in for the kill -- saying Russell and colleagues have failed to get the best value for taxpayers. Here's a quick chart showing UK GDP back to 2007 \u2013 before Britain plunged into its first (and officially - after the double dip was revised away - only) recession. NM Adrian Bailey cannot believe that the demand for Royal Mail would have evaporated if the price had been inched up by 20p to 350p. It was 20 times oversubscribed by City investors, he points out. Lazard's CEO Rucker claims that you can't take these City bids seriously -- there's lots of \"gaming\" going on. The biggest three bids were for \u00a31bn each -- the bidders didn't expect to get them, he claims. The grilling continues, with Robin Walker asking Cable if he regrets calling Panmure Gordon's valuation of Royal Mail an \"outlier\" after it predicted Royal Mail was undervalued by a billion pounds before the float. Cable claims not, and argues that it still can't know how much Royal Mail is worth. It will be a long time before we can take a view. The City has taken its view, of course - valuing Royal Mail at \u00a32bn more than the float price. Lazard's Rucker agrees that the Royal Mail was unusually over-subscribed - seven times at the retail level. But Facebook was 25-times oversubscribed, he points out. What is the point of paying advisers if you ignore their advice, asks Adrian Bailey, re UBS's advice that the price could have been pushed up by 20p. Fallon suggests the committee wants to have it both ways -- criticising the government for agreeing, and disagreeing, with UBS and Goldman. We considered the advice seriously, but in the end we took our view, he says. The ministers are now being grilled over another apparent blunder -- why did they not raise the IPO float above 330p in the days before the float? Robin Walker, Conservative MP, reminds Cable that UBS told the committee last week that the price could have been risen by another 20p, bringing in many millions more to the taxpayer. Cable says the government considered it, but decided that it was not worth the risk -- at a time when the markets were already worried about the threat of a US debt default. Lazard's William Rucker gives the City view -- it would have been difficult, and the 48-hour delay could have disrupted the float. Walker is not convinced -- was a two day delay really that bad? (in the history of a company that's been running for almost 500 years) Michael Fallon explained that \"In the end, we decided that the risks were just too high.\" If we'd overpriced this float and shares had fallen, like Facebook, we could have been locked out o f the market for another year or more and that could have threatened the six-day a week service, Fallon claims. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi moves onto the next big question -- the valuation process. Why were higher values of Royal Mail from banks who also pitched to work on the float seemingly ignored? Cable replies that the assessments made by JP Morgan, Citigtoup and Deutsche Bank were not seen as \"meaningful estimates\". They might not have been accurate. Ann McKeckin asks about the \u00a34m fees that could still be paid to Goldman and UBS. Could it be withheld if the government concludes that they undervalued Royal Mail? Possibly, Vince Cable says. He doesn't really explain what the criteria will be, though. And when will we know? Nor for months or years, Cable replies. So it could be after the next election.... Committee chairman Adrian Bailey is also concerned that Goldman's eToy's litigation wasn't considered by the government when it hired the firm It's like hiring Ronnie Biggs to advise Securicor, he says. Ann McKeckin, Labour MP, asks whether the government and its advisors considered that Goldman Sachs was involved in litigation over its role in an IPO when it awarded the investment bank a role in the Royal Mail float. This is the eToys flotation of 1999 -- which was concluded in September this year in a $7.5 million settlement. Mark Russell, chief executive of Shareholder Executive, reveals it was not considered. Did you ask? I think we'd rely on them to mention it, he replies. McKeckin is not impressed -- why wasn't the question of ongoing litigation part of the scoring process? No clear answer -- but I suspect the committee will recommend that it IS, next time the government holds a privatisation. The ministers, Cable and Fallon, agree that the buck stops with them over the \u00a33.3bn value placed on Royal Mail. Did Shareholder Executive conduct its own formal assessment of how much Royal Mail was worth? Mark Russell says no. Really, asks Adrian Bailey? As an outside it does seem odd to me that you didn't do your own valuation of a state owned company, he says. Russell clarifies -- Shareholder Executive was constantly evaluating how much Royal Mail was worth. But it didn't make a formal view. The ONS says its second estimate of UK third-quarter GDP is unchanged at 0.8% quarter-on-quarter; with the year-on-year figure also unchanged, at 1.5%. Economic growth broadened a little in Q3 as companies increased investment \u2013 but growth was still driven by consumer spending. A breakdown of the figures shows household spending was up 0.8% quarter-on-quarter (the highest since Q2 2010), while industrial output rose 0.6% on the quarter. Construction output was estimated at 1.7% (lower than the ONS had it in the preliminary data). NM The hearing over Royal Mail's privatisation is underway in the Grimond Room. It's also on BBC Parliament, -- the live feed hasn't quite started yet. Committee chairman Adrian Bailey kicks off, asking Mark Russell of Shareholder Executive why the government chose the two banks with the lowest initial valuation of Royal Mail -- Goldman Sachs and UBS -- to conduct the IPO. Russell replies that those initial values were only one small part of the valuation process. Bailey also points out that Russell was once a colleague of William Rucker, the head of Lazard. Was this really best practice? Apparently their careers only overlapped for a couple of years in the late 1980s. The hearing on the Royal Mail privatisation begins in a few minutes time, in the Grimond Room of Portcullis House. It's being streamed live here (if you open it in a new tab you can track the highlights and reaction here too). The BIS committee will hear from: Vince Cable MP, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Michael Fallon MP, Minister of State for Business and Energy, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Mark Russell, Chief Executive, Shareholder Executive, William Rucker, Chief Executive, Lazard Lazard was the government's independent adviser on Royal Mail, while Shareholder Executive is the body that manages the government's stakes in private companies (the government retained a 30% stake in Royal Mail after the float). From letters to Letta. The Italian prime minister is celebrating winning a confidence vote over next year's budget in the early hours of this morning. The defection of Silvio Berlusconi and a group MPs who still support the disgraced former PM didn't derail Enrico Letta's government. Letta won the vote by 171 to 135 - helped by right-wing MPs who stuck with him rather than following Berlusconi into opposition. Italian government debt is trading calmly this morning, with the 10-year bonds changing hands at yields of just 4%. No danger of Italy not being able to borrow at that level. Berlusconi is finally expected to be ejected from the Senate, following his tax fraud conviction, this afternoon. More on Reuters. Josh Raymond of City Index reckons Royal Mail investors should hold onto their shares for a little longer before considering a sale: Christmas has come early for the Royal Mail CEO, reports Lucy Tobin of the Evening Standard: Two important stories about Royal Mail to flag up ahead of the BIS committee hearing at 9.30am. The first is our own -- Law firm Clifford Chance has been running its eye over Royal Mail's large property portfolio. The Guardian understands that Clifford Chance has received a report containing details of around 800 properties held by the Royal Mail subsidiary Royal Mail Estates which are registered with the Land Registry in England and Wales. The portfolio includes a string of sorting offices and plots of land \u2013 such as the Mount Pleasant and Nine Elms sites in central London which are part of three property redevelopment plans already predicted to make Royal Mail around \u00a3300m. Around 95% of the portfolio is freehold property. Not clear what Clifford Chance's intentions are. Unions, campaigners, and some MPs are already concerned that the company's property assets were undervalued in the flotation. Here's the story: Law firm Clifford Chance analyses Royal Mail's property portfolio And here's an interactive map of Royal Mail's property, by my colleague Nick Mead. Second - the Independent has analysed the Royal Mail share register, and calculated that Goldman Sachs has traded millions of share on behalf of its clients following the floatation, generating big profits for anyone who received shares in the flotation -- at the price recommended by Goldman and UBS..... A new analysis of Royal Mail\u2019s official share register by The Independent has found that Goldman Sachs offloaded around 4.5 million Royal Mail shares worth at least \u00a325m between 31 October and 11 November \u2013 at the top of the market. The decision by the bank, which received millions of pounds from the Department of Business to price the Royal Mail at \u00a33.30-a-share when it floated last month, would have made its clients up to \u00a312m if the shares were sold at the \u00a35.87 peak. Revealed: Goldman Sachs clients' \u00a312m Royal Mail coup (Private Eye has also been doing good work on this issue...) It's a less cheerful morning for Albemarle &amp; Bond -- the pawnbroker's shares have tumbled after it issued another profits warning. It blamed the recent steady fall in the gold price, and a drop in demand for pawn-broking services, as it warned the City that: \"the Board believes that market expectations are significantly more optimistic than its own.\" Not any more they're not..... Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, agrees that Royal Mail's results have received a \" warm reception\", at a time when investors are fretting that its shares may have risen too high. Hunter points out that: Gradual but terminal decline of the letters business is an ongoing challenge. Royal Mail is also sticking to its plan of paying a dividend of \u00a3133m at the end of the financial year. At the flotation price of 330p, that meant a rather generous-looking yield of over 6% (one reason that so many people wanted a slice of the action). The subsequent share rally means the yield is now down to 3.5%. Royal Mail's traditional business of propelling letters onto the nation's doormats continued to decline, according to today's results. Total letter revenue fell by 5% in the six months to 29 September 2013. The 9% increase in parcel revenues balanced that out -- Royal Mail didn't actually shift more parcels than a year earlier, but it made more money from them due to changes in \"size-based pricing\". The City likes the look of Royal Mail's results. Shares jumped by over 5% in early trading to 563p. That's 70% higher than the 330p at which the government sold the shares in early October. Vince Cable claimed that the early share price spike was \"froth\" -- can he still claim that, six weeks after the float, with new financial results for investors to digest? The 'transformational programme' at Royal Mail has also slipped behind schedule in the last six months. It reports: Some of this was expected. However, the industrial relations environment has meant some activity has been deferred into next year. Despite that, the company has closed Mail Centres in Derby, Darlington, Bradford and Leicester, and plans to shutter another four by next March. Royal Mail also reports that business has been hit by the threat of strike action, which has loomed over the company for months and remains unresolved. From today's financial results: We are about to enter our busiest period of the year. Since September, as expected, there has been some customer reaction to the industrial relations situation. To date this has been limited to a slowdown in the rate of business customer acquisition in parcels and switching of some volume to competitors in anticipation of strike action. Yesterday, hopes that Royal Mail would announce a deal on pay and pensions with its workers were dashed. Instead, talks with the Communications Workers Union were extended, again, to December 3rd. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of events across financial markets, the world economy, the eurozone and the business world. Profits have doubled at Royal Mail, as the freshly privatised postal operator announces its maiden results to the City -- hours before ministers face a parliamentary grilling over its controversial flotation. Operating profits for the six months to the end of September -- Royal Mail's final time in public hands -- rose to \u00a3283m, up from \u00a3144m a year earlier. On a pre-tax basis (stripping out various one-off factors), profits more than doubled -- from \u00a394m a year ago to \u00a3233m. Parcel revenue was pretty strong -- up by 9% -- helping to push overall revenues up by 2%. Healthy looking numbers,which Royal Mail CEO Moya Greene says mean the company is on the right track: Our first half financial performance was in line with our expectations of delivering low single digit revenue growth and margin expansion. The combination of increasing EBITDA and moderating investment spend underpins value creation for our shareholders. It will only add to concerns that Royal Mail was floated too cheaply, or too early --before it had a chance to establish a real track record of profitability. The full results are online here -- here's the top line numbers: The results come as MPs on the Business, Innovations and Skills committee prepare to quiz Business Secretary Vince Cable. They'll demand answers on how, and why, Royal Mail was floated on the stock market last month at a valuation of \u00a33.3bn. Shares have soared since, giving the postal operator a valuation of \u00a35.3bn last night. Cable will face some tough questions - on why the valuation wasn't higher, why he didn't wait until the market conditions were better, and whether the bankers responsible -- Goldman Sachs and UBS - should receive \u00a34m in outstanding fees. That hearing begins at 9.30am GMT. What else is happening today? The big news in Europe is that Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU party has reached a coalition deal with the SPD, to create a coalition government and give Merkel a third term as chancellor (once SPD members have approved it). Here's our early take: Angela Merkel forms Germany coalition While in Italy, the Senate is preparing to vote on whether to expel Silvio Berlusconi from parliament over his criminal conviction. And in the UK, we get updated GDP data for the third quarter at 9.30am -- which should give more detail on how the economy fared in the last quarter. Did it, as first estimated, grow by a healthy 0.8%? I'll be tracking all the action through the day.",

      "bodyText": "Shops in Greece must be free to offer buy-one-get-one-free deals and determine their own product sell-by dates as part of wide ranging reforms to regulations that have prevented the debt-stricken country from recovering after the financial crash, according to a leading thinktank. The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said a bonfire of harmful regulations restricting trade and investment in four key industries was needed to create a more vibrant economy and foster growth. The Paris-based thinktank wants Greece to tackle 555 regulations hindering growth in the retail trade, food processing industry, building materials sector and tourism. It said the industries, which account for more than one-fifth of the economy, would generate \u20ac5.2bn (\u00a34.3bn) in extra activity once the measures were implemented. The report came as the OECD predicted Greece's debt would stay above 160% of GDP until 2020, almost 35 percentage points above the level forecast by its EU/IMF lenders in July. A steep fall in prices is behind much of the country's deepening debt problem. A forecast 12% fall in prices more than previously predicted would hurt growth and push the debt to GDP ratio higher. \"About two-thirds of this difference reflects the assumed larger deflation,\" the OECD said. \"Deflation pressure may be stronger and last longer than expected.\" Greece is in its sixth year of a recession exacerbated by the austerity measures attached to its multibillion euro bailouts Prices moved into deflationary territory for the first time in over four decades this year. \"If negative inflation risks materialise, assistance from Greece's euro area partners may need to be considered,\" the OECD said. The thinktank is the only major international organisation forecasting a seventh consecutive year of recession for Greece in 2014 \u2013 it forecasts the economy shrinking by 0.4%. Athens and its lenders expect GDP growth of 0.6% next year. The slump has shaved about a quarter off economic output. Risks to real growth are \"still on the downside\" even if the country fully implements all the reforms imposed by its lenders, the OECD said. Reform measures could also drag prices lower, but the overall effect would be expansionary as new entrants into sclerotic industries, increase overall activity, it said. Kostis Hatzidakis, Greece's minister for development and competitiveness, said that while the Greek economy has stabilised, there was widespread agreement that the country's \"dwindling competitiveness\" was restricting the recovery. \"It is true that our economy has been plagued by bureaucracy, protectionism and market distortions for a long time,\" he said. \"Our efforts have focused on generating growth by implementing and enhancing structural reforms, and not just by fiscal consolidation. \"Two necessary conditions for these structural reforms are to improve our competitiveness and to build a new, investment friendly, business environment.\" Horst Reichenbach, the head of the taskforce sent by Brussels to oversee Athens' use of EU loans, said he wanted Greece to press ahead quickly to remove obstacles \"that will have significant effects\". At the moment shops must gain clearance from public officials to offer discount deals. Sell-by dates on milk and other foodstuffs are also set by the Greek authorities. Among 329 recommendations, the OECD report said price restrictions also hampered competition in the tourism industry, which must submit cuts in nightly room charges to local public officials or trade associations. Licensing requirements that prevent new entrants to all four iundustries must be repealed to allow greater competition, it said. The report, which said the recommendations needed to be implemented in full to reap the benefits, said: \"Such benefits generally take the form of lower prices and greater choice and variety for consumers. Often this will result from entry of new, more efficient firms, or from existing suppliers finding more efficient forms of production under competitive pressure.\"",

      "body": "<p>Shops in Greece must be free to offer buy-one-get-one-free deals and determine their own product sell-by dates as part of wide ranging reforms to regulations that have prevented the debt-stricken country from recovering after the financial crash, according to a leading thinktank.</p> <p>The Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said a bonfire of harmful regulations restricting trade and investment in four key industries was needed to create a more vibrant economy and foster growth.</p> <p>The Paris-based thinktank wants Greece to tackle 555 regulations hindering growth in the retail trade, food processing industry, building materials sector and tourism.</p> <p>It said the industries, which account for more than one-fifth of the economy, would generate \u20ac5.2bn (\u00a34.3bn) in extra activity once the measures were implemented.</p> <p>The report came as the OECD predicted Greece's debt would stay above 160% of GDP until 2020, almost 35 percentage points above the level forecast by its EU/IMF lenders in July.</p> <p>A steep fall in prices is behind much of the country's deepening debt problem. A forecast 12% fall in prices more than previously predicted would hurt growth and push the debt to GDP ratio higher.</p> <p>\"About two-thirds of this difference reflects the assumed larger deflation,\" the OECD said. \"Deflation pressure may be stronger and last longer than expected.\"</p> <p>Greece is in its sixth year of a recession exacerbated by the austerity measures attached to its multibillion euro bailouts Prices moved into deflationary territory for the first time in over four decades this year.</p> <p>\"If negative inflation risks materialise, assistance from Greece's euro area partners may need to be considered,\" the OECD said.</p> <p>The thinktank is the only major international organisation forecasting a seventh consecutive year of recession for Greece in 2014 \u2013 it forecasts the economy shrinking by 0.4%.</p> <p>Athens and its lenders expect GDP growth of 0.6% next year. The slump has shaved about a quarter off economic output.</p> <p>Risks to real growth are \"still on the downside\" even if the country fully implements all the reforms imposed by its lenders, the OECD said.</p> <p>Reform measures could also drag prices lower, but the overall effect would be expansionary as new entrants into sclerotic industries, increase overall activity, it said.</p> <p>Kostis Hatzidakis, Greece's minister for development and competitiveness, said that while the Greek economy has stabilised, there was widespread agreement that the country's \"dwindling competitiveness\" was restricting the recovery.</p> <p>\"It is true that our economy has been plagued by bureaucracy, protectionism and market distortions for a long time,\" he said. \"Our efforts have focused on generating growth by implementing and enhancing structural reforms, and not just by fiscal consolidation.</p> <p>\"Two necessary conditions for these structural reforms are to improve our competitiveness and to build a new, investment friendly, business environment.\"</p> <p>Horst Reichenbach, the head of the taskforce sent by Brussels to oversee Athens' use of EU loans, said he wanted Greece to press ahead quickly to remove obstacles \"that will have significant effects\".</p> <p>At the moment shops must gain clearance from public officials to offer discount deals. Sell-by dates on milk and other foodstuffs are also set by the Greek authorities.</p> <p>Among 329 recommendations, the OECD report said price restrictions also hampered competition in the tourism industry, which must submit cuts in nightly room charges to local public officials or trade associations. Licensing requirements that prevent new entrants to all four iundustries must be repealed to allow greater competition, it said.</p> <p>The report, which said the recommendations needed to be implemented in full to reap the benefits, said: \"Such benefits generally take the form of lower prices and greater choice and variety for consumers. Often this will result from entry of new, more efficient firms, or from existing suppliers finding more efficient forms of production under competitive pressure.\"</p>",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The business secretary, Vince Cable, defended the government's valuation of Royal Mail on Wednesday after solid results from the newly privatised group sent its shares even higher. Royal Mail was privatised last month when the government sold 60% of its stake to investors in an initial public offering (IPO). Cable has been under fire over Royal Mail's sale price since before the flotation. The company's shares surged by more than a third on their first day of trading and have risen further since. Ahead of the group's stock market debut Cable dismissed a likely jump in the share price as \"froth\" and said it would take months before the shares settled to their true value. Giving evidence to the business select committee alongside his advisers, Cable stuck by \"froth\" as a \"good old Anglo-Saxon term\" and said market prices were not always rational. \"It will be a long time before we can take a view,\" he said. Cable and Michael Fallon, the business minister who handled the flotation, said they decided against increasing the sale price by 20p a share because the market was already jittery over a potential US debt default. But Mark Russell of the Shareholder Executive, which oversees state-owned businesses, admitted he and the government were surprised by the size of the rise in Royal Mail shares. \"We did not anticipate the share price to move as much as it did \u2026 I don't think any of us anticipated the size of the jump,\" he said. Moya Greene, chief executive of Royal Mail, lent Cable and Fallon support as she announced a near doubling of first-half profits in Royal Mail's first set of figures as a publicly traded company. \"This was the most complex transaction in my career and I believe the government did a really good job,\" she said. She added that analysts were getting over-excited about potential payouts from Royal Mail off-loading or selling and leasing back some of its vast property holdings. Clifford Chance, the City law firm with links to investment banks and big investors, is now analysing the company's portfolio of 2,000 UK properties. Greene said: \"People are probably running away a bit with themselves. They are looking at development with \u00a3 signs in their eyes that we would be a bit surprised by.\" Royal Mail shares were up 5% by mid-morning on Wednesday to 559.5p \u2013 70% higher than the flotation price of 330p. Its market value has increased by \u00a32.3bn since the flotation, which valued Royal Mail at \u00a33.3bn. Operating profit for the six months ended 29 September was \u00a3283m, up from \u00a3144m a year earlier. This year's figure was boosted by a \u00a335m VAT credit and restructuring costs \u00a350m lower than the year before. Total revenue increased 2% to \u00a34.52bn, helped by growth in Royal Mail's all-important parcels business. Royal Mail's performance depends heavily on increasing parcel volumes, boosted by deliveries of online purchases, and cutting costs to make up for declining letter deliveries, which fell 4% in the first half. Parcel volumes were flat in the first half, mainly because the hot summer reduced online purchases, Royal Mail said. But the introduction of size-based charges increased parcel revenue by 9%. Business customers have been wary about signing up to Royal Mail and have switched some business to competitors while the threat of industrial action loomed, the company said. As a result, parcel volumes may be flat for the nine months to the end of December, which includes Royal Mail's busiest period over Christmas. Greene said Royal Mail's Christmas parcel revenues were vital for the company to keep investing and improving. \"It affects everything because as a group if the revenue line comes off we have a very high fixed-cost base because we are a universal service provider.\" Royal Mail is in talks with the Communication Workers Union over a deal on pay and working conditions after the union called off a strike. The two sides have extended the deadline for agreement by a week, until 3 December. Royal Mail said it expected to pay a final dividend of \u00a3133m for the full year.",

The company's shares surged by more than a third on their first day of trading and have risen further since.</p> <p>Ahead of the group's stock market debut Cable dismissed a likely jump in the share price as \"froth\" and said it would take months before the shares settled to their true value.</p> <p>Giving evidence to the business select committee alongside his advisers, Cable stuck by \"froth\" as a \"good old Anglo-Saxon term\" and said market prices were not always rational.</p> <p>\"It will be a long time before we can take a view,\" he said.</p> <p>Cable and Michael Fallon, the business minister who handled the flotation, said they decided against increasing the sale price by 20p a share because the market was already jittery over a potential US debt default.</p> <p>But Mark Russell of the Shareholder Executive, which oversees state-owned businesses, admitted he and the government were surprised by the size of the rise in Royal Mail shares.</p> <p>\"We did not anticipate the share price to move as much as it did \u2026 I don't think any of us anticipated the size of the jump,\" he said.</p> <p>Moya Greene, chief executive of Royal Mail, lent Cable and Fallon support as she announced a near doubling of first-half profits in Royal Mail's first set of figures as a publicly traded company.</p> <p>\"This was the most complex transaction in my career and I believe the government did a really good job,\" she said.</p> <p>She added that analysts were getting over-excited about potential payouts from Royal Mail off-loading or selling and leasing back some of its vast property holdings. Clifford Chance, the City law firm with links to investment banks and big investors, is now analysing the company's portfolio of 2,000 UK properties.</p> <p>Greene said: \"People are probably running away a bit with themselves. They are looking at development with \u00a3 signs in their eyes that we would be a bit surprised by.\"</p> <p>Royal Mail shares were up 5% by mid-morning on Wednesday to 559.5p \u2013 70% higher than the flotation price of 330p. Its market value has increased by \u00a32.3bn since the flotation, which valued Royal Mail at \u00a33.3bn.</p> <p>Operating profit for the six months ended 29 September was \u00a3283m, up from \u00a3144m a year earlier.</p> <p>This year's figure was boosted by a \u00a335m VAT credit and restructuring costs \u00a350m lower than the year before. Total revenue increased 2% to \u00a34.52bn, helped by growth in Royal Mail's all-important parcels business.</p> <p>Royal Mail's performance depends heavily on increasing parcel volumes, boosted by deliveries of online purchases, and cutting costs to make up for declining letter deliveries, which fell 4% in the first half.</p> <p>Parcel volumes were flat in the first half, mainly because the hot summer reduced online purchases, Royal Mail said. But the introduction of size-based charges increased parcel revenue by 9%.</p> <p>Business customers have been wary about signing up to Royal Mail and have switched some business to competitors while the threat of industrial action loomed, the company said. As a result, parcel volumes may be flat for the nine months to the end of December, which includes Royal Mail's busiest period over Christmas.</p> <p>Greene said Royal Mail's Christmas parcel revenues were vital for the company to keep investing and improving.</p> <p>\"It affects everything because as a group if the revenue line comes off we have a very high fixed-cost base because we are a universal service provider.\"</p> <p>Royal Mail is in talks with the Communication Workers Union over a deal on pay and working conditions after the union called off a strike. The two sides have extended the deadline for agreement by a week, until 3 December.</p> <p>Royal Mail said it expected to pay a final dividend of \u00a3133m for the full year.</p>",
