      "bodyText": "Australia and the United Kingdom have been urged to negotiate a high-quality free-trade agreement to help rebuild public trust in trade liberalisation. The agreement should include labour and environmental standards but not a controversial investor dispute settlement clause, says new research from two progressive thinktanks, the McKell Institute in Australia and Demos in the UK. It backs the proposed trade agreement and argues the bilateral deal could be bigger than the sum of its parts, providing a constructive way forward at a time of rising protectionist sentiment. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The study notes the prospective trade pact between Canberra and London \u201ccomes at a pivotal moment in the economic and political histories of both nations\u201d. \u201cWhile the UK\u2019s Brexit vote is the most obvious economic shift in that nation\u2019s history for generations, Australia too is seeing a resurgence in populist political voices espousing more protectionist economic measures,\u201d it says. \u201cThese trends come at a time where internationally, a scepticism towards globalisation and free trade in particular is rising. This is perhaps most notable in the United States \u2013 a nation that leads a world economy defined by liberalised global trade but paradoxically has seen opposition towards that order reach fever pitch.\u201d It says that trade negotiators in Australia and the UK need to maintain their focus on securing good economic outcomes but they should also be aware that \u201ca successfully delivered, highly beneficial and highly transparent FTA between the two nations could help arrest some of the growing scepticism in both states against vital economic institutions such as liberalised trading regimes\u201d. It notes that Donald Trump\u2019s election in the US has formalised angst against a global economic system that a growing proportion of the community feels alienated from, and the way to push back against that sentiment is to produce trade deals that the public can get behind. It says that, from the British perspective, as the May government takes back responsibility for trade policy outside the European Union, the bilateral deal with Australia \u201ccould be an important model FTA, which it could then use for building new trading relationships around the world\u201d. From the Australian perspective, the bilateral trade deal could serve as a model to pursue separate conversations with trade officials in Europe. Australia is also pursuing a free-trade agreement with the European Union. The UK is not able to conclude FTAs while it is still a member of the EU but preparatory work is underway. A working group of officials is scoping out the terms of the bilateral agreement with a view to commencement in 2021. The UK leaves the EU in 2020. The joint study from McKell and Demos recommends the proposed UK/Australia trade deal include labour provisions that further the rights and future prospects of workers in both states, and environmental safeguards referencing the countries joint commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It recommends trade negotiators omit an investor state dispute settlement clause in the FTA \u201cin order to maintain transparency and generate broader public support\u201d. ISDS clauses have been included in trade pacts to protect investors from unfavourable decisions by foreign governments but they have become increasingly controversial. There is concern that multinational corporations use the system to chip away at environmental or health and safety regulations enacted by sovereign governments. The McKell/Demos study recommends the Australian and British governments conduct a transparent cost/benefit analysis of the deal and publicise the findings to build public buy-in and set a precedent for future negotiations. It says the scope of the deal should be wide enough to ensure tangible economic benefits are delivered, covering off trade in goods and services and labour mobility between the jurisdictions. Australia has signalled it wants to use the negotiations to secure reciprocal enhanced visa arrangements. \u201cThe Australia-UK FTA should be used as an opportunity for both states to ensure the standards of supply chains across all industries meet a minimum standard to help eradicate global transgressions of workers rights, and end modern slavery,\u201d the report says. Sam Crosby, the executive director of the McKell Institute, and now Labor candidate for the Sydney seat of Reid, told Guardian Australia that progressives\u2019 supportive of open markets and trade liberalisation needed to understand the challenges of the current environment, and keep evolving. \u201cThe conservatives have fallen into the trap of reciting the old stale script on FTAs and assuming working people will applaud, and [progressives] should not make the same mistake,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cAll over the developed world we can see how easily free trade can be demonised and scapegoated. But, unlike the conservatives, we should not be reflexively defensive or dismissive. We should be responsive. \u201cThe relationship between Australia and the UK presents an outstanding opportunity to negotiate a new kind of FTA that delivers real economic benefit, while simultaneously earning a broad social license. \u201cFree trade, if done right, should bolster living standards and equality. It is up to progressives to make the case for how.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Last week came the news that 1m jobs had been created since September 2013, and while it is an achievement that has seen the government crow loudly, a look at the data suggests that population growth and part-time work has been the main driver. It indicates that the achievement is rather less boast-worthy than the government would suggest. Back at the end of 2012, Tony Abbott pledged to create 1m jobs in five years and 2m in 10 years. Last month marked more than 1 million more people employed since the 2013 election in September that year \u2013 meaning the government have beaten it by five months. This was a bit of a surprise, not because this is a stunning achievement, but because even a year ago it looked unlikely. In May last year, the government was 16,000 jobs down on what they needed to be on track for 1m jobs in five years, and an annual employment growth rate of 1.8% was needed \u2013 but the 2017-18 budget was only forecasting growth of 1.5%. The past year has seen such strong employment growth that the target was reached with time to spare: But how significant is the achievement and how has it been achieved? Back when Tony Abbott made the pledge in late 2012, I wrote that \u201cwhile a million jobs sounds wonderful in a sound-bite kind of way, the reality is that achieving a million jobs over the next five years is easier than it was in 2001-2006, let alone in the mid-1980s. Clearly, Australia\u2019s population continues to grow and thus a million new jobs ain\u2019t what it used to be.\u201d And this has very much turned out to be the case. One million jobs in five years is not an unprecedented number. It had happened in the late 1980s and during the mining boom from 2006 to 2011: Of course the target is a tad easier now than then. In early 1988 when 1m jobs in five years was first achieved, we had a population above 15 years of age of around 12.7 million. At the end of 2005 when it was next achieved, the population was up to 16.3 million. Now it is around 20 million. It\u2019s why the better measure of looking at employment has always been the employment to population ratio \u2013 as that takes into account population growth \u2013 whether it be natural or migration. And here things are rather unimpressive. In September 2013, 61.1% of the adult population was employed, now it is 62%. That 0.9% point increase is welcomed but hardly stunning \u2013 and certainly not over a five year period. Consider that when 1m jobs were created from December 2000 to December 2005, the employment to population ratio rose from 59.1% to 62.1%. Even more damming is that since September 2013 the percentage of adults employed full-time has actually fallen. At the time of the 2013 election, 43% of adults worked full-time, now it is just 42.4%. That is a fairly clear representation of how uninspiring is the 1m jobs boast. Part-time employment makes up 31% of all employed, but it accounted for 47% of the 1m jobs created. Even more divergent is the growth of full-time work for men \u2013 43% of all employed are full-time men, but they accounted for just 25% of the 1m jobs: This over-representation of part-time work among the employment growth has also led to a rather small growth in the average number of hours worked per capita since September 2013. Back in September 2013 adults worked an average of 86.1 hours a month (this includes all adults, even those not in the labour market), now it is up to 86.7 hours \u2013 the highest level for five years, but still a rather weak level of growth given the overall increase in employment: The big story however of the 1m jobs is not so much population or even part-time work, but female workers. The growth of women in the labour force has been rather stunning. In September 2013, the participation rate of women was 58.6%; now it is 60.7%. By contrast the participation rate of men has fallen from 71.2% to 70.8%. And yet more than half of the increase in women\u2019s participation has occurred just in the past 12 months: Had the surge in women entering the workforce not occurred, the 1m jobs pledge would still be waiting to be achieved and would be unlikely to come true. It took 41 months to get half way to the 1m total, and just 15 months to get the rest of the way \u2013 and 55% of the employment created in the past 15 months has been for female workers. And as I have noted previously, the NDIS and other health care and social assistance work has been the main driver of that surge. Once again showing that, despite the Liberal party\u2019s protestation of the contrary, yes, governments can create jobs. There has also been a strong growth in employment of people over 65 \u2013 up 33% since September 2013. Such workers also accounted for an oversized share of the 1m jobs \u2013 around 13%, despite accounting for just over 4% of the total workforce: The addition of 1m jobs in under five years is something that the government will boast about, but it is pretty clear the large part of the increase is due to population increase and also a major increase in government funding for the NDIS which has created a surge in work in the healthcare sector. The small increase in the percentage of the population employed compared to previous periods where 1m jobs had been created in five years demonstrates the mark was hardly shooting for the stars. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "The FTSE 100 soared to a new record on Monday after news of a truce in the contentious trade dispute between the US and China cheered investors and helped send the pound lower against the dollar. News that the world\u2019s two largest economies had backed away from a potentially disastrous trade war and agreed to abandon plans to raise tariffs on each other\u2019s exports lifted the UK\u2019s leading index to a peak of 7868.12, the first time it has climbed above 7800. This beats the previous high of 7792.56 set in the middle of January and is more than 14% above this year\u2019s low of 6866 recorded towards the end of March when the UK expelled Russian diplomats after the Salisbury nerve agent attack. The index lost some of its gains as the day progressed but still ended at a new record close of 7859.17, up 80.38 points or 1.03% on the day. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: \u201cInvestors seemingly haven\u2019t been put off by the general lack of specifics surrounding what was actually agreed between the US and China, crucial details like the extent to which America\u2019s deficit with its rival will be reduced and how this new trading \u2018framework\u2019 will be implemented.\u201d The UK market has been steadily rising over the past few days, with investors shrugging off concerns about the customs union and the Irish border. The previous record close came as recently as last Thursday, with the market helped by a weak pound and rising oil prices. The trade truce gave another boost to the dollar, removing for the moment at least the fears of the damage the dispute could do to the US and global economy. The pound fell 0.4% against the dollar to $1.3414, giving a lift to the large number of overseas earners in the FTSE 100 who benefit from a weaker sterling. Brent crude rose 0.42% to $78.84 a barrel after climbing above $80 last week, pushing the share prices of oil and commodity companies higher. Dave Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets said: \u201cSupply concerns in light of President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the US from the Iranian nuclear deal still persist. The relatively high price has encouraged others to keep production levels high.\u201d Mergers and acquisitions have also played a part in boosting company valuations, with GKN and Ladbroke Coral already falling to predators this year and Sky, Sainsbury\u2019s, SSE, packaging group Smurfit Kappa and Shire all involved in takeover situations. Russ Mould, investment director at asset management group AJ Bell also pointed out that investors buying shares in FTSE 100 companies could receive better than average returns. He said: \u201cThe FTSE 100 offers a dividend yield above 4%, according to an aggregate of consensus dividend forecasts for each individual constituent. This beats cash and the 1.49% yield offered by the benchmark 10-year government bond or gilt hands down. Such a yield could be a source of support for the index and chip in a healthy percentage of total returns from UK stocks in 2018.\u201d Most European markets were also lifted by the trade talks truce. Germany\u2019s Dax was closed for the Whitsuntide Monday holiday but France\u2019s Cac finished 0.4% higher at 5637 and Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 added 0.35%. However Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.5% on continuing concerns about the policies of its new coalition government and possible tensions with the rest of the European Union. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.21% higher at 25,013. It was the first time the index had closed above 25,000 since March. But gold slipped back $2 to $1288 an ounce due to the rise in the dollar, and as investors shunned safe havens in favour of riskier assets.",

    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "The US-China trade truce has given a lift to stock markets at the start of the new trading week. Helped by a weaker pound, the FTSE 100 has hit a new peak, while most European markets managed to move higher. A notable exception was Italy, where investors are growing increasingly concerned about the new coalition\u2019s plans for borrowing and its attitude to the rest of the European Union. Italian bond yields rose sharply and the stock market fell back. Dan Smith, investment analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, said: The Five Star Movement (5SM) and Lega progression in forming a coalition government has increased the level of political risk in Italy, particularly as both parties are interested in relaxing fiscal policy (government spending and taxes) \u2013 a result which will raise tensions between Italy and European institutions and raise question marks over the country\u2019s commitment to the European Union. Overall the final scores showed: The FTSE 100 rose 1.03% to a new closing high of 7859.17 Germany\u2019s Dax was closed for the Whit Monday holiday France\u2019s Cac climbed 0.41% to 5637.51 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB fell 1.52% to 23,092.38 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is currently up 1.2% or more than 300 points. On that note, it\u2019s time to close for the evening. Thanks for all your comments, and we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The FTSE 100 has finished at 7859.17, up 1.03% and a new record closing high. Earlier in the day it touched a new all time intra-day peak of 7868, on relief that the chances of a trade war between the US and China seemed to have receded. A weaker pound also helped, of course. Companies dealing with China are among the gainers in the FTSE 100, not surprisingly. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, said: The US-China news has been excellent for the stock of Burberry and AstraZeneca, both firms with key operations in China. The fear stalking such companies has been that any wider spat between Beijing and Washington will take a chunk out of economic growth in the former. Now, fears of a hit to middle-class incomes and GDP growth have been reduced, and we have seen six-month highs in the former and an eleven-month peak in the latter. Throw in further declines for the pound and further upside looks likely. Corn prices have hit a two year high following the cooling of the trade dispute. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, said: The prospect of more US agricultural exports to China if the communist country agrees to open up its markets helped corn prices hit a two-year high. Corn is already in a price-supportive environment of supply shortages in China, Brazil and Argentina, which make up a third of global production. The FTSE 100 could breach the 8000 barrier soon after its boost from the US-China trade news, depending on this week\u2019s economic news. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said: Investors seemingly haven\u2019t been put off by the general lack of specifics surrounding what was actually agreed between the US and China, crucial details like the extent to which America\u2019s deficit with its rival will be reduced by and how this new trading \u2018framework\u2019 will be implemented. It helps that there has been little in the way of data or other economic news to challenge these developments for headline-dominance, allowing the markets to indulge in a bit of bullishness. That bullishness arguably most benefited the FTSE, which piggybacked on this wave of market-relief, alongside the pound\u2019s politically fragile Brexit problems, all the way to a fresh record peak. Crossing 7850 for the first time in its history following a 1% surge, the FTSE now has 8000 in its sights \u2013 and with a pair of much-anticipated inflation and GDP readings on Wednesday and Friday respectively, the index could just get the boost it needs if sterling is dealt another dovish blow. Here\u2019s the AP report on the latest trade developments: President Donald Trump on Monday hailed his administration\u2019s temporary truce with China on trade, even as his Treasury secretary and China struck a note of caution on the latest agreement. After high-level talks in Washington last week, Beijing has agreed to \u201csubstantially reduce\u201d America\u2019s trade deficit with China. \u201cOn China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time,\u201d Trump tweeted. Farmers, he promises, will come out on top. \u201cUnder our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce,\u201d he tweeted. Both sides, however, have said there are no guarantees trade tensions are over. China hasn\u2019t said how much it\u2019s willing to reduce the U.S. trade gap. The Trump administration had sought to slash the deficit by $200 billion. Also left unclear is the issue of intellectual property. The U.S. has long accused Beijing of secretly stealing U.S. technology from American businesses. Treasury Security Steven Mnuchin said Monday those issues \u201care part of our framework. These things cannot be fixed overnight.\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has been part of the U.S. negotiating team, is expected to go to China soon to follow up on last week\u2019s discussions. A day after declaring the trade war \u201con hold,\u201d Mnuchin told CNBC Monday that Trump is reserving the right to reimpose tariffs against Chinese goods if the two countries can\u2019t agree on specifics to bring down the massive trade deficit with Beijing. Likewise, China\u2019s foreign ministry said details still have to be worked out. \u201cGiven the increasing interaction between the two countries, we cannot assure you they will not encounter more frictions or disputes in the future,\u201d said spokesman Lu Kang. The trade talks truce has given a lift to US markets, along with a spate of acquisition activity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added more than 1% to 25,016, while the S&amp;P 500 opened 0.59% higher and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7%. Among technology shares, chipmakers which supply to Chinese companies were in demand after the trade news. Apart from relief that a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies had been averted, at least for the moment, US investors welcomed news that General Electric planned to merge its transportation business with rail equipment maker Wabtec. Financial shares gained ground after Fifth Third Bancorp said it would buy MB Financial for $4.7bn. Time for a summary, before the opening of Wall Street... Relief that the US and China have backed away from a trade war has sent Britain\u2019s stock market up to a record high. The FTSE is currently up 51 points at 7830, on track for a record close. Earlier it reached an intraday high of 7851, as the City welcomed the news that Washington and Beijing have reached an agreement on trade. US secretary Steven Mnuchin has told reporters that \u201cmeaningful progress\u201d has been made, with China promising to help close the US trade gap. However, details for the deal are yet to he ironed out. Both sides have agreed to abandon plans to raise tariffs on each other\u2019s exports; however, tariffs could yet be imposed if the deal falls apart. Donald Trump has tweeted that China will bring down barriers preventing American firms from exporting more goods. Grain and soybean prices have risen, in a boost for US farmers. The Chinese government has also welcomed the easing in tensions. There is also quiet satisfaction in Beijing that China did not bow to pressure to cut the US trade deficit by $200bn, as Trump demanded. The US dollar has strengthened against most other currencies, including the pound, which has slumped to a new 2018 low. Sterling is bobbing around $1.34, as traders worry about Britain\u2019s economy and the slow progress around Brexit. Steven Mnuchin has also predicted there will be \u201ca 35 to 40% increase\u201d in exports of US farm products to China in the near future. Here\u2019s a clip of the Treasury secretary speaking to reporters: US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin on CNBC now. Mnuchin says the US and China made \u201cmeaningful progress\u201d during this month\u2019s trade talks. Both sides have agreed to suspend tariffs, he confirms, and US exports to China will increased \u201csignificantly\u201d going forwards. Mnuchin agrees that these talks now need to be turned into a proper framework - US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross will travel to China soon to help achieve this. But what about Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to help Chinese telecoms firm ZTE overcome sanctions imposed by America? Mnuchin denies that there was any \u201cquid pro quo\u201d here. The Treasury secretary also warns China that Trump can put tariffs back onto exports, if the US doesn\u2019t get what it wants. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s optimism, we really don\u2019t have much detail about exactly how China will help to cut the US trade deficit. The agreement reached last weekend states that China will buy more US goods to achieve a \u201cmeaningful increases in United States agriculture and energy exports\u201d. But with no firm target, judging whether China is delivering (and accepting enough deliveries from America) could be tricky. That\u2019s why some experts predict that the dispute will flare up again. Vincent Chan, head of China equity research for Credit Suisse, predicts that US-China trade spats could become an annual event. He told clients: \u201cAny expectation of a fundamental settlement of the disputes between the both sides would be unrealistic. The political and economic relationship between China and the U.S. has changed dramatically in the last few years.\u201d President Trump is also welcoming the agreement with China - saying it will help US exporters such as farmers. President Trump has just tweeted: Chuck Schumer, a senior Democrat, warned Donald Trump last weekend not to let Chinese President Xi Jinping \u201cplay\u201d him in trade talks. Schumer challenged Trump not to stop pushing China over the theft of American intellectual property - something the president says has been a problem for too long. Today\u2019s rally means the FTSE 100 has now gained over 900 points, or 13%, since late March. Good news for anyone who had the foresight to buy equities then, in the face of worries over a trade war. However, this rally is partly driven by the weakness in the pound over the last month. Sterling has dropped by almost 10 cents, or 0.6%, from $1.43 to $1.34 as the government\u2019s failure to make progress on Brexit has worried the City. American farmers are waking up to some good news - soybean and grain prices are up, thanks to the trade war truce. A bushel of soybeans is trading at $10.15 this morning, up 1.7%. Corn is up 0.8% and wheat has risen by 0.5%. Soybeans featured highly on the list of US products which China proposed imposing tariffs on. It followed up this threat by actually cancelling purchases of US soybeans, which are an important source of protein for both humans and animals. Trade tariffs are a blunt weapon that can cause self-inflicted pain, as Paul Donovan of Swiss bank UBS explains: China and the US have agreed not to increase taxes on their own consumers by avoiding tariffs for now. The agreement at the conclusion of trade talks was suspiciously light on details. The overall US trade deficit is likely to grow this year. The Chinese government has welcomed America\u2019s decision to row back from a trade war. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters in Beijing that a consensus was good for all parties. Lu said (via Reuters): \u201cChina has never hoped for any tensions between China and the United States, in the trade or other arenas.\u201d. Chinese media are also pointing out that this consensus was reached without any major concessions on their side. For example, the China Daily newspaper says that \u201cDespite all the pressure, China didn\u2019t \u2018fold\u2019\u201d. Instead it \u201cstood firm\u201d and negotiated with the Trump administration - without accepting demands for a $200bn cut in the US trade deficit with China. Here\u2019s Neil Wilson of Markets.com on today\u2019s stock market rally: \u201cThe FTSE 100 notched up a fresh record high, rising clear of 7800 for the first time as the feel-good factor from the trade war truce bolstered risk sentiment and a weaker pound delivered the usual shot of adrenalin for the blue chips. It looks like progress on talks between China and the US means we are not about to descend into a punitive trade war. Whilst there is still long way to go and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, there has undoubtedly been solid progress and the sense of relief in equity markets is palpable. But we must note that the FTSE\u2019s gains of late are probably more attributable to a weaker pound as the dollar rallies across the board. The strengthening dollar is also causing pain in some emerging markets, where currencies are falling fast this morning: The weaker pound is driving shares in London to fresh record peaks. The FTSE 100 has now climbed 60 points to 7838 for the first time ever, a gain of 0.78%. Firms with large overseas earnings, such as chemicals group Johnson Matthey and advertising giant WPP, are benefiting from the fall in sterling. The truce between Washington and Beijing is also fuelling the rally, of course, even though they haven\u2019t reached a detailed agreement. Mihir Kapadia of Sun Global Investment explains: The general positive sentiment reflects the decline of worries of a possible trade war between the U.S. and China, following weekend developments. Packaging firm Smurfit Kappa, who would have suffered from a trade war, are up 1.5%. Mining giant Anglo American is up 1.8%; it would have been hit by weaker commodity prices if new tariffs had been imposed between the US and China. Bloomberg says the British pound is suffering from Brexit angst and signs that UK growth has slowed. The main thing investors are waiting for is to see whether the latest economic figures show any upturn, after a sluggish first three months of the year when the Beast from the East snowstorm swept across the country. That could push higher the odds of an interest-rate increase as early as August by the Bank of England..... Aside from the date, the U.K. will go into the next round of Brexit talks this week against a backdrop of euro-zone turmoil as Italy\u2019s populist coalition pushes ahead with an agenda that\u2019s at odds with the European Union establishment. At home, backbench members of parliament are said to be preparing for an Autumn election as they anticipate defeats on Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s key piece of Brexit legislation. The pound has hit its lowest level since the start of the year. While traders aren\u2019t worrying about trade wars, they are getting jittery about Brexit again. Sterling has just fallen back to $1.3397, down 0.77 of a cent, the lowest level since 28 December 2017. Foreign secretary Boris Johnson can take some credit, or rather blame. On a trip to Argentina yesterday, he issued a new challenge to prime minister Theresa May not to allow Britain to remain tied to the customs union after 2020 through a \u2018backstop\u2019 agreement. Our political editor Heather Stewart is in Buenos Aires, and explains: This backstop has been one of the sticking points in talks with the EU27 and some in Westminster believe it could become the post-Brexit norm if Brussels accepts the UK\u2019s proposal. But Johnson insisted: \u201cBrexiters fearing betrayal over the customs backstop must understand that the PM has been very clear that it is not an outcome we desire; we want a deal with the EU and she will deliver it.\u201d Yesterday, the Sunday Times claimed that Conservative MPs are preparing themselves for a snap general election over fears Theresa May will not be able to break the Brexit deadlock. That would create even more political tension and uncertainty, just months before Britain\u2019s exit from the EU. Metal prices are also getting a small lift this morning. Reuters has the details: Copper edged higher on Monday after China and the United States put their trade row \u201con hold\u201d, easing concerns that the dispute could escalate, although headwinds from a stronger dollar capped further gains. \u201cIt appears that America and China have moved towards a trade deal, which will mean the expansion of U.S. goods purchased by China, and thus, avoiding the prospect of an out-and-out trade war,\u201d said Kingdom Futures in a report. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.1 percent at $6,860 a tonne by 07:27 GMT, reversing small losses from the previous session. Prices have been caught in a tight $6,765-$6,900 range for the past week. The FTSE is continuing to climb to fresh record levels, putting 8,000 points in its sights (I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get there today, though!). Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx says: After intermittently fretting over signs that hostile relations were heating back up between the US and China last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s claim on Sunday that a trade war was \u2018on hold\u2019 has sent a \u2013 cautious \u2013 wave of relief through the market. Italy, though, is bucking the trend with a sharp fall. That\u2019s partly due to nervousness over the prospect of two populist parties taking power. But....several big Italian companies have just gone \u2018ex-dividend\u2019, meaning the deadline to buy them to receive the next payout to shareholders has passed. That has knocked their shares lower. The US dollar has hit its highest level in five months, against a basket of other currencies. That\u2019s another sign that traders are comforted that the US and China have frozen tariffs on a swathe of exports - something that could have hurt the American economy. This truce may also make it easier for the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, to raise American interest rates in the months ahead - another reason to buy the dollar now. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, reminds us that America and China haven\u2019t actually hammered out a full agreement on trade yet. Sayed points out that details of the truce remain vague. This was the second round of trade negotiations without clearly defined targets, suggesting that there\u2019s still a long way to go. Today, a trade war may have been averted, but according to the joint statement from both countries, nothing is being guaranteed apart from China promising to increase American imports Boom! The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index has burst to a new-alltime high this morning. The Footsie gained 35 points, or 0.45%, to 7814 points for the first time ever. European markets are also benefiting from the easing of trade war fears. France\u2019s CAC has gained 0.24%, while the Spanish IBEX is up 0.33%. Shares in London are also getting a currency boost - the pound has dropped half a cent against the US dollar this morning to $1.3414. Although there\u2019s relief that the US and China have stepped back from a trade war, analysts are also cautious. Tai Hui, chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at JP Morgan, predicts further clashes between the two sides: Historical precedents suggest the U.S. could re-engage with China on trade issues if it sees China dragging its feet on fulfilling its pledges. Moreover, the last three months have further exposed Washington\u2019s concerns over China\u2019s advancement in technology and its threat as a competitor, both commercially and strategically. It\u2019s like a back pain that never goes away. It was a shock in the first instance it happened, but then life goes on as the most acute symptoms are addressed. The good news is that markets should learn to live with it and consider its impact more rationally.\u201d Eswar Prasad, trade policy professor at Cornell University, says we are looking at \u201clittle more than a brief de-escalation of tensions,\u201d \u201cThe fundamental differences on trade and other economic issues remain unresolved.\u201d Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, believes last weekend\u2019s breakthrough will boost stock markets: The undeclared \u201ctrade war\u201d between US and China has been put on hold according to US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin as the two superpowers agree on a economic truce. This development puts the planned tariffs on hold while the two countries work on a plan to re-balance their trade relations and dampens the geopolitical risk. An easing of risks on a global scale will be a positive catalyst for the dollar and global equities while demand for safe haven assets like gold and the Japanese yen will remain subdued. Britain\u2019s blue-chip share index of top shares is likely to smash through 7,800 points for the first time ever today. City traders are predicting a rally in London, thanks to the new spirit of detente between the US and China over trade. The FTSE 100 is forecast to gain around 30 points to 7815, breaching the previous intraday high. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group points out that the two sides haven\u2019t resolved all their issues. But it\u2019s a start, at least. US and China stepping back from the brink of a trade war has lifted sentiment, boosting equity indices, putting the FTSE on track for a fresh record high. Asian equities have bounced and Europe points to a higher start, as Trump\u2019s administration halts plans to impose trade tariffs on China, whilst China promises to significantly increase its purchase of US farm exports and energy. This is by no means the end of the matter, especially given the huge gap that remains between the two sides, as highlighted by the lack of any real detail in the announcement. However, this was the encouraging start to talks that traders were after. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Relief is coursing through the markets today after America and China stepped back from the brink of a trade war. Following tense negotiations, the two sides have reached an agreement that means tariffs will not be slapped on tens of billions of dollars of imports. The news has sent markets rallying in Asia, and could push Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index to a fresh all-time high today. Stocks on Wall Street are all expected to gain, with the Dow Jones industrial average being called up 200 points (0.8%). US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the ceasefire last night. He told Fox News that Beijing had agreed to a framework to help reduce the US\u2019s huge trade deficit with China. This includes China buying more US products. Mnuchin said: \u201cWe\u2019re putting the trade war on hold, right now, we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework.\u201d Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He, who took part in trade talks in Washington, has also told the media that the two sides had agreed not to launch a trade war. The breakthrough means that tit-for-tat tariffs will not now be imposed on good flowing between the two countries, such as robots, machinery, chemicals and soybeans But, significantly, China hasn\u2019t agreed to cut the deficit by a fixed amount - and certainly not the $200bn which the Trump administration were pushing for, But still, the deescalation has been welcomed by investors. China\u2019s stock market has posted gains; the SSE Composite index of leading shares is up 0.8% today. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index has gained 1%. European markets are expected to follow suit when trading begins. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says: Concerns about an escalation in tensions between China and the US appear to have been deferred in the short term after progress in trade talks at the weekend. We\u2019ll be tracking all the reaction through the day...",

In early trading in New York, the Dow Jones was up more than 300 points, or 1.2%, with Wall Street\u2019s S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes also making gains. The markets were buoyed by comments made by the treasury secretary and White House top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who both said the US had reached an agreement with a visiting Chinese trade delegation to ease trade imbalances between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Despite the vagueness of the terms, Mnuchin put a positive spin on the talks, telling CNBC on Monday they had already produced tangible benefits. \u201cI think we\u2019ve made very meaningful progress. Now it\u2019s up to both of us to make sure that we can implement it.\u201d The agreement, or truce, aimed at reducing the US\u2019s annual $337bn trade deficit with China was reached after an announcement from Beijing that it would \u201csignificantly increase\u201d purchases of American farm goods, energy and other products and services. \u201cWe want China to open up markets, lower tariffs, lower non-tariff barriers, give us a chance. We also want China however to change their behavior with respect to technology transfers and also the theft of intellectual property rights,\u201d Kudlow told CBS on Sunday. However, the two sides avoided specifically addressing underlying American complaints or systemic trade imbalances that led to the Trump administration\u2019s demand on China to increase purchases by $200bn annually \u2013 a specific commitment notably omitted from Saturday\u2019s joint communique. After Mnuchin said on Sunday that the two sides were \u201cputting the trade war on hold\u201d, China issued a statement overnight saying it could not guarantee that renewed trade tensions with Washington could be avoided. \u201cGiven the increasing interaction between the two countries, we cannot assure you they will not encounter more frictions or disputes in the future,\u201d advised Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, at a briefing. \u201cIf the two governments can reach an agreement which is acceptable to both sides, the two governments should certainly abide by it,\u201d Lu added. Shi Yinhong, director of the Center for American Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, told the Associated Press he doubted the truce would be enduring. \u201cI don\u2019t think the truce will last very long,\u201d Shi said. \u201cThe antagonism in trade will ebb and flow in China-US relations in the long term.\u201d Analysts at DailyFx, a forex advisory service, said the latest US-China trade skirmish \u201cmay ultimately prove to be another stepping stone on the path to deeper global trade integration\u201d. But it cautioned that \u201ca period of discomfort may be in the immediate future; even history shows that the path to trade liberalization hasn\u2019t been a straight line\u201d. In the joint statement, the delegations said they would keep talking over the summer. But Mnuchin insisted on Sunday that despite making \u201cmeaningful progress\u201d, the US would be free to impose tariffs if Beijing did not live up to its commitments. \u201cWe have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework,\u201d he said.",

Shoppers will no longer find date labels on some of the retailer\u2019s own-brand apples, potatoes, tomatoes, lemons and onions, which it hopes will prevent them from being thrown away while still edible. The move follows a campaign by the National Federation of Women\u2019s Institutes (NFWI) into the causes of food waste, which found that less than half of respondents understood the meaning of best before dates. However, more than 70% of people polled identified the meaning of compulsory use by labels, which have to be put on foods that carry a safety risk if eaten after that date. That includes meat, fish and dairy products, but not fruit and vegetables, which have only best before dates. The latter are put on foods by retailers as a quality indication to show that though they are no longer at their best they are still safe enough to eat. Food waste is a huge issue in the UK, with \u00a313bn of edible food thrown away from homes every year, according to the government\u2019s waste advisory body, Wrap.

Tesco\u2019s head of food waste, Mark Little, said: \u201cWe know some customers may be confused by the difference between best before and use by dates on food and this can lead to perfectly edible items being thrown away before they need to be discarded. \u201cWe have made this change to fruit and vegetable packaging as they are among the most wasted foods.\u201d The Food Standards Agency says: \u201cThe best before date \u2026 is about quality and not safety.\u201d Tesco is a signatory of the Courtauld Commitment 2025, a voluntary agreement by several leading organisations that aims to meet the UN\u2019s goal of halving food waste by 2030. David Moon, the head of business collaboration at Wrap, said: \u201cThis change by Tesco provides a good opportunity to learn about the customer response, and we anticipate Tesco will share its findings. \u201cWith all fresh produce, appropriate storage including use of the refrigerator is essential in giving the customer more time to use their food, so clarity of storage advice on packs and in stores will be vital.\u201d Lynne Stubbings, the NFWI chair, said its members were \u201cdetermined to ensure the UK is a world leader in tackling food waste, so we congratulate Tesco in taking this important step, and encourage all other retailers to follow\u201d.

The charges related to the \u00a311.8bn emergency fundraising conducted by the bank in 2008 as it struggled to maintain its independence and avoid a government takeover. However, charges against the bank\u2019s former chief executive and other top managers remain in place. The Qatari investment that helped prop up the bank has been mired in controversy, and after a five-year investigation the SFO last summer brought charges of conspiracy to commit fraud against Barclays and former senior executives. But in a statement issued to the stock market on Monday the bank said: \u201cBarclays announces that the crown court has today dismissed all charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office against Barclays plc and Barclays Bank plc regarding matters which arose in the context of Barclays\u2019 capital raisings in 2008.\u201d However, the charges dismissed by the court only involve Barclays as a corporate entity. The charges made by the SFO against the individuals \u2013 the former chief executive John Varley and other top executives Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris and Richard Boath \u2013 still stand and proceedings remain live in their cases. Barclays also admitted its court battle with the SFO is unlikely to be over, noting that \u201cthe SFO is likely to seek to reinstate these charges by applying to a high court judge to recommence proceedings via a new indictment of the same charges\u201d. The bank added in the statement that the crown court dismissal of the case \u201cshould not be taken to indicate any finding on the issue of whether a criminal offence has or may have been committed by other persons\u201d. The SFO said it was digesting the result of the court hearing and would respond soon. It said in a statement: \u201cWe are considering our position in respect of today\u2019s ruling concerning the companies.\u201d Barclays declined to comment beyond its statement to the stock market, but the case dismissal will be a major relief to a bank that has been plagued by legal and regulatory problems. The charges dismissed on Monday include two charges of \u201cconspiring with certain former senior officers and employees of Barclays to commit fraud by false representations\u201d. The other charges dismissed were against Barclays plc and Barclays Bank plc for \u201cunlawful financial assistance contrary to section 151(1) of the Companies Act 1985 in relation to a $3bn loan provided to the State of Qatar in November 2008\u201d. The distinction between Barclays plc and Barclays Bank plc, the lender\u2019s operating company, was important, as the bank\u2019s licences and regulatory approvals are held at the operating level. The charges against Barclays were the first criminal charges to be brought in the UK against a bank for activities during the financial crisis. Andrew Katzen, a partner at lawyers Hickman &amp; Rose said: \u201cThe SFO\u2019s most high-profile corruption prosecution has fallen at the first hurdle, but Barclays isn\u2019t off the hook yet. The SFO is almost certain to seek to continue the prosecution by applying to the high court to issue what is called a voluntary bill of indictment. \u201cNevertheless, the ruling makes for an inauspicious start for the prosecutor as it awaits its new director.\u201d David Green stepped down as director of the SFO last month and the organisation\u2019s chief operating officer, Mark Thompson, has been appointed interim head. Earlier this month in an unconnected case, the Barclays chief executive, Jes Staley, was ordered to hand over more than \u00a31.1m out of his own pocket as punishment for attempting to unmask a whistleblower. Staley was fined a total of \u00a3642,430 by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, and Barclays has clawed back \u00a3500,000 of his bonus over the matter.",

      "bodyText": "The Ryanair chief executive, Michael O\u2019Leary, has said the airline may have to review its new luggage policy if large numbers of passengers continue to hand over their bags at the gate. Ryanair has introduced a stricter cabin bag policy, which means customers have to pay \u00a35 for priority boarding to avoid having their main cabin bag checked in to the hold at the departure gate. This has improved boarding and punctuality, the airline said, but O\u2019Leary added that \u201cit is creating a handling issue, especially at peak periods\u201d such as bank holiday weekends and during the summer. \u201cThere are many flights where we\u2019re now having to put 100 or 120 gate bags free of charge into the hold,\u201d O\u2019Leary said in a video presentation. \u201cIf that continues to build, it\u2019s something we may have to look at again.\u201d Ryanair\u2019s net profit rose 10% to \u20ac1.45bn (\u00a31.27bn) in the year to the end of March, despite a rota fiasco that led to pilot shortages and 10,000 flight cancellations. This forced the budget carrier to recognise unions and raise pay. However, O\u2019Leary warned of a fall in profits this year, saying the outlook was \u201con the pessimistic side of cautious\u201d. He said there could be strikes in some countries over Ryanair\u2019s discussions to recognise trade unions, but the airline would face any action down. The company warned profits would fall back to \u20ac1.25bn to \u20ac1.35bn in the current year, a decline of up to 14%, due to rising oil prices and nearly \u20ac200m of extra staff costs. O\u2019Leary said air fares were likely to be flat over the coming year, as it takes about 12 months for changes in fuel prices to feed through to fares. He added that he believed airlines that had not hedged oil prices, such as Norwegian, would struggle next winter and that this would \u201caccelerate the shakeout\u201d in the industry, with some carriers going bust. Ryanair averted widespread Christmas strikes by unilaterally recognising unions in December for the first time in its 32-year history, but it has struggled to formalise relations in some countries. \u201cBeing unionised means we will have occasional strikes,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. Ryanair repeated its warnings about the risk of a hard Brexit, and said it would scrap voting rights for non-EU shareholders if there was no transition agreement.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union has sparked a dramatic fall in the number of French, Dutch and Belgian businesses registering in the UK, in a further illustration of Brexit\u2019s impact on the UK economy. Figures from Companies House show that French companies registered 48% fewer businesses in the UK in 2016-17 than the previous financial year while companies in Belgium registered 38% fewer. Companies in the Netherlands, which is probably the worst affected by Brexit of Britain\u2019s trading partners, registered 52% fewer companies last year than in 2015-16. The collapse in company registrations mirrors the reluctance of foreign companies to invest in the UK either by building new factories or buying UK businesses. OECD figures show that foreign direct investment into the UK tumbled in 2017 by 90% following a bumper year in 2016. Business lobby groups have blamed the downturn on the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit talks. Several business leaders and thinktanks have criticised Theresa May\u2019s failure to secure more detailed agreement inside her own party on the preferred trading relationship with the EU before triggering Article 50 last spring. EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, warned that Brexit was also having an impact on job applications which has dropped by 17% since last year. In addition, the business lobby group said a further 13% of manufacturers reported an increase in EU workers leaving their firms. Many of those employees were returning to the EU permanently, it added, leaving companies struggling to recruit suitably skilled staff in the UK. The EEF report, Navigating Brexit: The Migration Minefield, calls on ministers to move swiftly to give companies and their EU workers greater certainty over their future status to stem the flow back across the channel. Tim Thomas, the director of skills and employment Policy at EEF, said: \u201cSkills shortages are endemic in manufacturing and engineering, and companies are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to access the skills they need post-Brexit. \u201cWhile the slump in job applications from the EU has slowed, there is still much to be done to make sure UK businesses are still able to attract the very best talent from Europe.\u201d Proper guidance for EU workers seeking settled status would do much to mitigate this problem, according to the report. Four in 10 (39%) of manufacturers need help in understanding the ways to support EU employees to gain residency/settled status and 68% want guidance on what the changes after March 2019 will mean for employers and their EU employees. The fall in the number of EU firms registering companies in Britain was limited to 5% overall following a rush of application from the tax-friendly jurisdictions of Luxembourg and Cyprus. Businesses in Luxembourg registered 71% additional companies while firms in Cyprus doubled their registrations. Lynne Hardwick, the head of marketing at Evolution Money, which compiled the report, said: \u201cThe decrease in EU company registrations sets a worrying precedent, suggesting that overseas organisations may not see the UK economy as a safe place to do business. We can only hope this trend reverses as these businesses are a vital part of our infrastructure.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "What is money laundering? In British law, money laundering is defined as the process of concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing criminal property. It is an offence to launder your own ill-gotten gains, but you can also be prosecuted for knowingly helping manage another person\u2019s dirty money. An offence only occurs if the cash can be identified as the proceeds of a crime; for example corruption, bribery, theft, drug dealing or even tax evasion. In practice, laundering usually involves injecting cash gained through these kinds of activities into the legitimate financial system, in a way which disguises its origins, so that the money appears to come from a clean source. In the UK, the offence carries a maximum prison term of 13 years. The main legislation governing money laundering is the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The longest sentences are reserved for complex schemes, which involve abuse of trust and power, pressuring others into helping, and a long and close relationship between the money handler and the criminal. Why is money laundered? It is difficult to spend dark money without first hiding where it came from. A criminal may suddenly find themselves with large amounts of cash. Too much to keep under the mattress. Enough to arouse the suspicion of the bank manager when it is deposited. Paying for houses, cars, holidays and school fees with stacks of \u00a350 notes is difficult to do without attracting the attention of the taxman. Spending and safeguarding the money can be as complicated as acquiring it. The predicament is explained in the television series Breaking Bad, when corrupt lawyer Saul Goodman tries to persuade a drug dealer to hide the source of his earnings by investing in a nail salon. \u201cI\u2019ve got three little letters for you: I-R-S,\u201d Goodman warns. \u201cIf they can get Capone, they can get you.\u201d Crime boss Al Capone\u2019s control of the Chicago underworld was famously brought to an end not by the police, but by an 11-year sentence for tax evasion. Gangster finance is something of a side issue. The cases that in recent years have made money laundering an international issue more typically involve helping the rich and powerful salt away gains from activities that are clearly illegal, but for which they are unlikely to be prosecuted at home. Recent examples include the looting of Angola\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the sale of valuable mining concessions in the Democratic Republic of Congo in exchange for bribes paid to its president, the government-sanctioned theft of state assets by Russian oligarchs or, in what has become known as the Magnitsky case, the acquisition of wealth by public officials through a complex tax fraud. How can criminal funds be concealed? With the advent of universal banking, and therefore traceable money, gangsters began to look for ways to disguise their earnings. Traditionally, this was done through businesses where tax inspectors might struggle to determine the number of customers, or the quantity and value of what was sold. Businesses like restaurants, nightclubs, bakeries \u2013 or nail salons. Revenues from crime would be injected alongside genuine income from painting nails. They were then banked, taxed, and legitimised. These methods belong increasingly to the analogue era. Since the 1980s, digital money has allowed the laundering business to move offshore, and the amount of being moved has ballooned into the hundreds of billions. An estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime puts the annual sum at between 2 and 5% of global GDP, so between $800bn and $2tn. As the agency says, even the lower number underlines the seriousness of the problem governments are facing. Meanwhile, the trickle of money into tax havens which began in the last century has become a flood. The total now held in offshore banks is estimated at 10% of global GDP and rising. Britain alone launders \u00a390bn each year, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA). The figure includes the proceeds of almost all serious and organised crime committed in the UK, but also a significant amount of the corruptly obtained assets of politicians and public officials from overseas. This loot finds its way mainly into the housing market. Companies incorporated in the UK\u2019s network of tax havens own 57,000 properties in Britain. Of these, 16,000 are in just two London boroughs: Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, according to research by Global Witness. This is high-end money laundering, and it is a thriving British industry staffed by a network of what the NCA describes as \u201cprofessional enablers\u201d, who in exchange for a fee will turn a blind eye to how the cash was obtained and who really owns it. The key actors here are lawyers, bankers, accountants and a loosely regulated but vital part of the chain \u2013 fiduciary service providers. The now-defunct Panamanian firm Mossack Fonseca provided fiduciary services. It was licensed by tax havens to incorporate offshore companies and its employees acted as nominee directors and shareholders, lending their signature to the paperwork and bank accounts of companies over which they had no real control and in this way hiding the real owners. A typical offshore laundering scheme involves layers of anonymously held shell companies and unregistered trusts. Trusts are particularly controversial, because their existence is usually not recorded by any government. The money flows out of the country where it was acquired \u2013 say China \u2013 into a bank account controlled by a Jersey trust, for example, which in turn might control a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. That company may then be used to purchase real estate in a safe, law-abiding city like London. Hedge funds and other collective investment schemes, many of which are also managed using offshore structures, are another favoured route. Offshore companies can be used to collect deposits from bribes or frauds and those deposits are then moved into legitimate investment schemes with a minimum of questions asked. Profits from the scheme emerge clean and can safely make their way into the ordinary retail banking system. Why has money laundering become a talking point? For years reporters and prosecutors working to trace unpaid taxes, oligarch fortunes and financial frauds have only been able to follow the money so far. The roadblock created by offshore secrecy has limited understanding of what happens in, say, the British Virgin Islands or the Isle of Man. Thanks to a series of massive data leaks from tax havens, the lid has been lifted. The files of HSBC\u2019s Swiss bank, the Panama Papers and most recently the Paradise Papers have exposed in great factual detail the offshore machinations of the world\u2019s wealthiest individuals and corporations. What is the government doing to prevent financial crime? The latest round of efforts to stem the flow of dark money into Britain began some years ago, during David Cameron\u2019s premiership. He made it a central theme of Britain\u2019s presidency of the G8 group of wealthy nations. Leaders attending the 2013 G8 summit in Northern Ireland were persuaded to sign declarations promising to make company ownership more transparent. Cameron held up his end of the bargain. All those owning more than 25% of a company registered in England and Wales must now give their name and basic details including a contact address. But he did not extend this transparency to trusts \u2013 in fact he lobbied against it in Europe. And he left office before the same reforms could be introduced where they were most needed: Britain\u2019s network of offshore tax havens. The baton was picked up by the campaigning Labour MP Margaret Hodge. She formed a cross-party alliance with the help of the Liberal Democrats and the former conservative minister Andrew Mitchell. On 1 May, 20 Conservative MPs stood ready to defy the government and ministers capitulated. Hodge\u2019s amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill means that if Britain\u2019s 14 overseas territories do not introduce public registers of company owners by December 2020, they will be ordered to do so by the crown. If passed undiluted, the reforms will lead to the unmasking of the owners of hundreds of thousands of screen companies within less than two years. The reform has been condemned as a colonial throwback by the overseas territories and it will be fiercely resisted, particularly by the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Other havens have close relationships with certain industries to sustain them after transparency comes. Bermuda is an insurance hub; the Caymans Islands are a nexus for hedge funds. Most of the UK havens service between 10,000 and 30,000 offshore companies. By comparison, the BVI is an incorporation factory \u2013 it was responsible for supervising 390,000 active entities at the end of 2017. BVI Premier Orlando Smith has stopped short of calling for independence from Britain, but he has said the move \u201ccalls into question our very relationship with the UK\u201d. Cameron set the ball rolling on other important reforms. In January, legislation known as unexplained wealth orders came into force. The laws are designed to help prosecutors seize the UK assets of individuals who are suspected of corruption but are unlikely to be taken to court in their country of origin. America now looks weak on transparency - states including Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada allow beneficial ownership to remain hidden. The US does tolerate these onshore havens, but its federal agencies have aggressively pursued Swiss and British banks. Since 2010, any bank wishing to do business with America (most banks need to deal in dollars) must disclose all US account holders to the Internal Revenue Service, under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. Unfortunately, the flow of information is one way because the US has not agreed to share information on foreign nationals holding accounts in America. What next? Government has promised to introduce transparency to the Land Registry by 2021. Any overseas company that purchases UK property should by then be required to declare its owners publicly. Campaigners are concerned about the three-year delay, and believe the measures should come into effect immediately. They would also like transparency to be extended to trusts, with government registers recording who their beneficiaries are and what assets they control. Reforms are still needed in the three crown dependencies: Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. They have more freedom to set their own rules and can in theory choose whether to introduce public registers of the beneficial owners of offshore companies. Hodge and Mitchell believe they can be persuaded, and are planning a tour of the islands. \u201cWhat we plan to do now is to go to the Isle of Man for talks there and then possibly to Guernsey and Jersey,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cThe intention is that we will try and persuade them of the wisdom of copying what Britain and the Overseas Territories have done and what most of Europe is going to do.\u201d The latest anti money laundering legislation from Europe provides for public registers of company owners in all member states by 2019. If the crown dependencies resist, they will be outliers. \u201cAll territories associated with Britain ought to be governed to the same standards and with the same transparency,\u201d says Hodge. \u201cThe purpose of this measure is to tackle all dirty money entering through any British territories. You can\u2019t leave a few out.\u201d Further reading The BBC television series McMafia was adapted from a book of the same name written by the former Guardian and BBC journalist Misha Glenny. It tells of the rise of transnational crime since the fall of the Soviet Union. Published in 2010, Nicholas Shaxson\u2019s ground breaking Treasure Islands traces the roots of Britain\u2019s network offshore network back to the postwar years. The economist Gabriel Zucman uses statistics to uncover the sums hidden offshore in The Hidden Wealth of Nations In Capital Without Borders: Wealth Managers and the One Percent, the sociologist Brooke Harrington observes the financial facilitators up close, as she trains for a year to become a money manager.",

The key actors here are lawyers, bankers, accountants and a loosely regulated but vital part of the chain \u2013 fiduciary service providers.</p> <p>The now-defunct Panamanian firm Mossack Fonseca provided fiduciary services. It was licensed by tax havens to incorporate offshore companies and its employees acted as nominee directors and shareholders, lending their signature to the paperwork and bank accounts of companies over which they had no real control and in this way hiding the real owners.</p> <p>A typical offshore laundering scheme involves layers of anonymously held shell companies and unregistered trusts. Trusts are particularly controversial, because their existence is usually not recorded by any government. The money flows out of the country where it was acquired \u2013 say China \u2013 into a bank account controlled by a Jersey trust, for example, which in turn might control a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. That company may then be used to purchase real estate in a safe, law-abiding city like London. </p> <p>Hedge funds and other collective investment schemes, many of which are also managed using offshore structures, are another favoured route. Offshore companies can be used to collect deposits from bribes or frauds and those deposits are then moved into legitimate investment schemes with a minimum of questions asked. Profits from the scheme emerge clean and can safely make their way into the ordinary retail banking system.</p> <p><strong>Why has money laundering become a talking point?<br></strong>For years reporters and prosecutors working to trace unpaid taxes, oligarch fortunes and financial frauds have only been able to follow the money so far.</p> <p>The roadblock created by offshore secrecy has limited understanding of what happens in, say, the British Virgin Islands or the Isle of Man. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"945f3818b0fd4341e5630e159af931eb8272f1c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/945f3818b0fd4341e5630e159af931eb8272f1c9/0_184_5516_3309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bermuda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bermuda was at the centre of the Paradise Papers expose after leaked information showed how the global elite use offshore tax havens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thanks to a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/tax-havens-dodging-theft-multinationals-avoiding-tax\">massive data leaks</a> from tax havens, the lid has been lifted.

He made it a central theme of Britain\u2019s presidency of the G8 group of wealthy nations. Leaders attending the 2013 G8 summit in Northern Ireland were persuaded to sign declarations promising to make company ownership more transparent.</p> <p>Cameron held up his end of the bargain. All those owning more than 25% of a company registered in England and Wales must now give their name and basic details including a contact address. But he did not extend this transparency to trusts \u2013 in fact he lobbied against it in Europe. And he left office before the same reforms could be introduced where they were most needed: Britain\u2019s network of offshore tax havens. <br></p> <p>The baton was picked up by the campaigning Labour MP Margaret Hodge. She formed a cross-party alliance with the help of the Liberal Democrats and the former conservative minister Andrew Mitchell. On 1 May, 20 Conservative MPs stood ready to defy the government and ministers capitulated. Hodge\u2019s amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill means that if Britain\u2019s 14 overseas territories do not introduce public registers of company owners by December 2020, they will be ordered to do so by the crown.</p> <p>If passed undiluted, the reforms will lead to the unmasking of the owners of hundreds of thousands of screen companies within less than two years. The reform has been condemned as a colonial throwback by the overseas territories and it will be fiercely resisted, particularly by the British Virgin Islands (BVI). </p> <p>Other havens have close relationships with certain industries to sustain them after transparency comes. Bermuda is an insurance hub; the Caymans Islands are a nexus for hedge funds. </p> <p>Most of the UK havens service between 10,000 and 30,000 offshore companies. By comparison, the BVI is an incorporation factory \u2013 it was responsible for supervising 390,000 active entities at the end of 2017.</p> <p>BVI Premier Orlando Smith has stopped short of calling for independence from Britain, but he has said the move \u201ccalls into question our very relationship with the UK\u201d.</p> <p>Cameron set the ball rolling on other important reforms. In January, legislation known as unexplained wealth orders came into force. The laws are designed to help prosecutors seize the UK assets of individuals who are suspected of corruption but are unlikely to be taken to court in their country of origin.</p> <p>America now looks weak on transparency - states including Delaware, Wyoming and Nevada allow beneficial ownership to remain hidden. The US does tolerate these onshore havens, but its federal agencies have aggressively pursued Swiss and British banks. </p> <p>Since 2010, any bank wishing to do business with America (most banks need to deal in dollars) must disclose all US account holders to the Internal Revenue Service, under the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act\">Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act</a>. Unfortunately, the flow of information is one way because the US has not agreed to share information on foreign nationals holding accounts in America.<br></p> <p><strong>What next?<br></strong>Government has promised to introduce transparency to the Land Registry by 2021. Any overseas company that purchases UK property should by then be required to declare its owners publicly. Campaigners are concerned about the three-year delay, and believe the measures should come into effect immediately.</p> <p>They would also like transparency to be extended to trusts, with government registers recording who their beneficiaries are and what assets they control.<br></p> <p>Reforms are still needed in the three crown dependencies: Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. They have more freedom to set their own rules and can in theory choose whether to introduce public registers of the beneficial owners of offshore companies.<br></p> <p>Hodge and Mitchell believe they can be persuaded, and are planning a tour of the islands.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we plan to do now is to go to the Isle of Man for talks there and then possibly to Guernsey and Jersey,\u201d says Mitchell. \u201cThe intention is that we will try and persuade them of the wisdom of copying what Britain and the Overseas Territories have done and what most of Europe is going to do.\u201d</p> <p>The latest anti money laundering legislation from Europe provides for public registers of company owners in all member states by 2019. If the crown dependencies resist, they will be outliers.</p> <p>\u201cAll territories associated with Britain ought to be governed to the same standards and with the same transparency,\u201d says Hodge. \u201cThe purpose of this measure is to tackle all dirty money entering through any British territories. You can\u2019t leave a few out.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Further reading</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4d60e759d14c67fdb89a26b4e4328dc00c4df9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4d60e759d14c67fdb89a26b4e4328dc00c4df9a/0_0_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Norton as Alex Godman in McMafia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the television series McMafia actor James Norton played Alex Godman, a Russian financier who turns to money laundering.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Cuba/Nick Wall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The BBC television series McMafia was adapted from a book of the same name written by the former Guardian and BBC journalist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha_Glenny\">Misha Glenny</a>.
