      "bodyText": "The government knew of a plan that could have retrieved more than \u00a3360m from Carillion, limiting the cost of its collapse to taxpayers and sparing pension scheme members from cuts to their retirement payouts, but did not encourage directors to pursue it. Multiple sources told the Guardian that the Cabinet Office, responsible for oversight of government contractors, did not apply any pressure on Carillion\u2019s directors to adopt the proposals, presented by accounting firm EY in mid-December last year. EY\u2019s plan would have involved breaking up the company, selling the profitable parts and placing the rest into liquidation, avoiding an involuntary collapse. The accounting firm believed this would generate \u00a3364m, of which \u00a3218m could be injected into the firm\u2019s 13 pension schemes, estimated to have a deficit of close to \u00a31bn. One source familiar with the company\u2019s final weeks said this could have prevented some of the schemes entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), an outcome that will reduce the amount that many of its 27,500 members receive in retirement. A spokesperson for the former directors admitted last week that they rejected EY\u2019s plan, believing they could still engineer a turnaround by convincing banks to swap some of their debt for stakes in the company. Several sources have confirmed to the Guardian that the Cabinet Office also saw EY\u2019s calculations but did not put any pressure on Carillion directors to pursue it. EY drew up two scenarios, an involuntary insolvency that would leave little cash to pay creditors, pensioners and the administrators, or the break-up plan that could have raised \u00a3364m. \u201cBoth options were communicated to government, the company\u2019s lenders and pension trustees at the time,\u201d said the former directors\u2019 spokesperson. The Cabinet Office confirmed it had seen the options presented by EY but declined to comment on how it responded. A spokesman said: \u201cThroughout this process, the government has been clear that its priority is to ensure that public services continue to run properly, and we regularly meet with our strategic suppliers and monitor their financial health. Since the collapse of Carillion, our plans have ensured that public services can continue to run as normal.\u201d But the Guardian understands that government officials, who were holding weekly meetings to monitor Carillion\u2019s health, did not believe it appropriate to offer business advice to directors. A source who was present at discussions between the company, government and the pension trustees said: \u201cI think they [the government] thought that if they could get to the end of January, they could find new finance and the company would survive, maybe in a different structure. \u201cI don\u2019t think they thought it would go bang.\u201d The source added that there was no certainty that EY\u2019s plan would have worked but admitted that if it had, some pension schemes could have stayed out of the PPF, which would have incurred a lower liability. He added that it could also have lowered the expense borne by taxpayers, who have so far spent \u00a350m out of \u00a3150m set aside by the government to pay for Carillion\u2019s liquidation process. Jon Trickett, the shadow minister for business and the Cabinet Office, said: \u201cThis is astonishing. They [the government] were asleep on the job, the question is why. \u201cThe first explanation is a blind ideological commitment to outsourcing, that private is always better than public even when it\u2019s blindingly obvious that the public sector needs to intervene. The second is that they\u2019re preoccupied with infighting over Brexit. \u201cThe public purse, the staff, recipients of Carillion\u2019s services and the pension fund are all suffering as a consequence of public failure.\u201d Gail Cartmail, the assistant general secretary at trade union Unite, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s catalogue of failures with regards to Carillion is growing by the day. By failing to ensure an orderly break up of Carillion they have cost the taxpayer millions of pounds in insolvency costs and redundancy payments. \u201cIt also meant that sub-contractors continued to provide goods and services to Carillion which they will never be paid for which has resulted in workers losing their jobs and companies going to the wall. \u201cThis is yet another reason why we need a full public inquiry into Carillion\u2019s collapse so that all the relevant information is placed in the open and those responsible for this terrible mess are named and shamed.\u201d Fresh revelations about the government\u2019s failure to act come a day after MPs conducting an inquiry into Carillion\u2019s demise released evidence they said indicated \u201cgross failings of corporate governance and accounting\u201d. MPs on the business committee and their counterparts on the work and pensions committee published a report that was commissioned in September by banks that were considering lending the company more money. The report warned that Carillion was facing a financial crisis after suffering major losses on key projects in the UK, Canada and the Middle East, accusing it of \u201coverstatement\u201d of profits on the contracts. Less than four months later, Carillion collapsed into liquidation, a process that has cost taxpayers \u00a350m, triggered 1,400 redundancies and threatened the survival of thousands of firms in the company\u2019s supply chain. Written by business advisory group FTI, the report highlighted accounting practices designed to \u201cenhance the reported profitability and net debt position\u201d of Carillion, rather than dealing with its underlying practices. These included deferring payments, bringing forward receipts from contracts and accepting short-term loans from joint-ventures. \u201cThe group has been poorly managed for a considerable period during which time significant underperformance and contract issues have been masked by aggressive accounting,\u201d FTI said. It accused the company of accepting large contracts too quickly and on \u201cinappropriate\u201d terms, in order to secure upfront payments and report large contract wins. It said Carillion compensated for its failure to convert its reported profits into genuine cash by racking up ever higher debts. When confronted with FTI\u2019s findings, the company\u2019s management said they believed the assessment was too harsh, according to the report. But FTI insisted its report was balanced and did not even represent a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario, adding that lending Carillion any more money would be \u201cextremely high risk\u201d.",

Writing in a letter to the chair of the House of Commons work and pensions select committee at the end of last month, leaked to the Mail on Sunday, the retail tycoon told Field it was time to \u201cavoid another public spat, that you so enjoy\u201d. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we call a truce. You say it is not personal, it could not be more personal. Go and tackle Carillion or someone else. I think eighteen months later everyone is bored with this story,\u201d he wrote. Last month, Field, the chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, said he thought Green had \u201cgot away with murder\u201d over the failure of BHS with a \u00a3571m black hole in its pension scheme in April 2016. The comment was the latest in a long-running dispute between the two men. Green, who sold the chain for \u00a31 to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell a year before the retailer shut down, agreed to pay \u00a3363m in cash to rescue the BHS pension scheme. He has threatened Field with legal action after the politician claimed to have seen leaked details of the official investigation into the BHS crisis. Field has also since pursued assurances from Green over the health of the pension scheme at his Arcadia Group, which includes fashion outlets Topshop and Miss Selfridge, and is also in deficit. Arcadia has highlighted plans agreed last year to double its pension contributions to \u00a350m a year. In his latest letter to Field, Green wrote that \u201cif the company is sold, there are pension obligations and there is a process that they will need to adhere to should that arise\u201d. He also said the pensions regulator was satisfied that processes are in place to protect funds were Arcadia sold. Green has been forced to deny Arcadia is up for sale in recent weeks, after leaks to the Sunday Times suggested he asked HSBC to help him find a buyer. His spokesman said on Sunday that neither Green or his wife, who is the principal shareholder of the company, had ever \u201cmet formally with HSBC regarding disposal of Topshop, Topman, or any part of the Arcadia Group, nor have they ever instructed the bank to find a buyer for all or part of the business\u201d. Field said on Sunday that Green could \u201cact above board\u201d and pay an insurance company to take on the entire pension liabilities of Arcadia. \u201cThat would free him to get on with the sale which the Sunday Times reports, but on which he still seems to be in a state of denial,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "Tax may as well be a four letter word. Politicians have found little public support for raising taxes over the years. Think of the poll tax riots, the furore over Ed Miliband\u2019s mansion tax or George Osborne\u2019s \u201comnishambles\u201d budget and the pickle he was in over the humble pasty. Usually the most resistance is reserved for wealth taxes, not least for their doom-laden names given by the media: no voter wants to pay for death tax or dementia tax. Denis Healey, the Labour chancellor misquoted for wanting to \u201csqueeze the rich until the pips squeak\u201d, came closest, with a 1974 election wealth tax pledge but was forced to backtrack. The pips would have squeaked a little too loud for comfort. Fast forward and the time has come to make the case for greater wealth taxes, given our emerging economic realities, demographic shifts and growing levels of inequality. The alternative is a country bereft of welfare support, or wallowing in ever-greater mountains of debt. The latest politician to push for a change of tone may raise a few eyebrows. It isn\u2019t John McDonnell or Jeremy Corbyn, but David Willetts, the Conservative peer who was a universities minister under David Cameron. Lord Willetts will attempt to make the case for greater wealth taxes in a speech on Monday. The reasons are clear. The public purse will be out of pocket by roughly \u00a3160bn by the mid-2060s as the number of people over 65 grows by almost a third, while the working age population is expected to only increase by about 2%. The government\u2019s own forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, reckons healthcare spending will need to almost double from 6.9% of GDP in the early 2020s to 12.6% by the mid-2060s because of demographic shift alone. More people will become net beneficiaries of the welfare state than net contributors could support, according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation, which Willetts chairs. That is unsustainable; regardless of how efficiently the state spends our taxes and which party is in power. |The divide between rich and poor is growing and it\u2019s proving increasingly difficult to earn your way to riches. Wealth taxes are being considered as a result, with work also being done by the Institute for Public Policy and Research expected to be published next month. The level of wealth in Britain \u2013 including property, cash savings, shares and pensions \u2013 rose by 15% in the two years to June 2016 to a record \u00a312.8tn. But that vast stockpile is unevenly spread: the top 10% of households owned almost half, while the poorest fifth\u2019s overall wealth decline in real terms. The divisions of wealth are far starker than differences in pay. According to the Office for National Statistics, the top 10% of households by income earn 6.8 times more than those on the lowest rung, but the wealthiest 10th of households have 290 times more in total assets than those at the bottom of the pile. Barring great luck or skilled entrepreneurship \u2013 in itself something easier to embark upon for the children of the wealthy \u2013 it\u2019s nigh-on impossible to earn your way to riches. Nowhere is the myth of the plucky grafter better torn apart than in a new book by the writer James Bloodworth, who spent six months living and working in low-wage Britain for companies like Amazon and Uber. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may be the richest man in the world, but his workers in Warrington, Rugeley, Swansea and elsewhere may never join the uber-elite for all the hours they toil. Bloodworth was paid the equivalent of \u00a312,740 a year to work gruelling shifts packing boxes full of books and DVDs. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates pay of \u00a317,100 is needed just to achieve a minimum standard of living. The trouble would be implementing the changes required. Polling shows wealth taxes are viewed as the most unfair way for the government to raise money, even though the accumulation of wealth is often passive \u2013 particularly for property owners. Part of the problem is trust in government to spend taxes well. Labour has a particular issue given Tory attacks since the financial crisis \u2013 labelling the mess as \u201cLabour\u2019s recession\u201d caused by profligate overspending. It was time for collective belt-tightening in penance for the excesses of the past. \u201cWe will not burden our children and grandchildren,\u201d ran the Tory mantra. Now a former Conservative cabinet member will say the same to justify raising taxes, rather than cutting spending. Willets will argue the time has come for baby boomers to reach into their pockets to benefit younger generations. The age of tax cuts is over, he will say. Instead, politics will be about who pays more and how much. \u201cWe need a well-funded welfare state capable of helping us in our old age and we should help pay for it, rather than expecting our hard-pressed children and grandchildren to bear the whole burden,\u201d he is expected to say. Given his time in government included hiking student tuition fees up to \u00a39,250 a year, he should expect accusations of hypocrisy. But Labour would do better to use his message as a catalyst for consensus building. Britain already has some versions of wealth taxes that could be reformed. Council tax, still reliant on property values as they were in 1991, would be the obvious place to start. Inheritance tax is another. The bulk of money left each year in inheritances has more than doubled in past 20 years, and will more than double again over the next two decades. There is a danger that greater wealth taxes could impoverish those who are asset rich but cash poor. Not all those living on millionaire\u2019s row are actually millionaires \u2013 unless they sell and move somewhere cheaper. So the design of any increase in wealth taxation would be key. The French economist Thomas Pikketty has argued that without change, inheritance will eventually matter a lot more when determining a person\u2019s life chances, as it did in ancient societies. Past wealth, he says, will tend to dominate new wealth \u2013 and successors will tend to dominate labour earners. The time now is not for turning the clock back. Instead, the time for a wealth tax has come.",

      "bodyText": "No customers were troubling the Jaguar showroom in Welwyn Garden City on Friday, at the start of what is usually its busiest month. Even one with a car on order had not turned up in the snow, said Mark Lavery, chief executive of Cambria Automobiles, looking at a \u00a375,000 Jaguar coupe: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to spoil an F-type with all that salt on the roads.\u201d The unseasonal weather will only be a blip on sales: a bigger worry for the industry is the dark, persistent cloud over the future of diesel. The bottom is falling out of the market, to the point where one of Lavery\u2019s managing directors couldn\u2019t persuade his own mother to buy one: \u201cHis mum is 74, has driven a diesel for the last 15 years and has now changed it for a petrol one \u2013 a higher carbon-emitting, more polluting car.\u201d Yet while diesel vehicles were pushed by the industry and government on the promise of cutting carbon dioxide emissions, the world is now more urgently addressing its dirty corollary: the NOx emissions which have fouled urban areas and contribute to 40,000-50,000 premature deaths a year in the UK alone from air pollution. The drumbeat against diesel picked up pace this week as judges decided that German cities, in the heart of Europe\u2019s biggest car market, have the right to ban diesels on their streets, and Rome\u2019s mayor proposed an outright ban from 2024, a year before Paris expects the same. In London, in April 2019 an ultra-low emission zone will double the congestion charge payable to drive in the city centre for any but the very newest, Euro 6, diesel cars, and campaigners are pushing for even tougher sanctions. Boroughs including Islington and Camden have introduced higher parking charges for diesel drivers. Other UK cities are still considering how to implement so-called \u201ctoxin taxes\u201d on drivers of older vehicles, although Manchester and Leeds have made clear that ordinary car drivers would not be charged. Some manufacturers see the writing on the wall: this week, Fiat Chrysler announced plans to end production of diesel cars by 2022; Porsche has ditched two models and Toyota has indicated it will never launch a new diesel. But British manufacturers are keen to resist: Jaguar Land Rover in particular is on the hook, with diesel representing around 90% of its cars sold in 2017. It invested heavily four years ago in a new, multi-billion pound Euro 6 engine plant in Wolverhampton, just as Ford was spending almost \u00a3400m on its diesel plant in Dagenham. In 2017, UK car sales fell, marginally, for the first time in five years \u2013 but diesel numbers tumbled spectacularly, by 17.1%. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) pointed to relatively small tax reforms announced by the chancellor in the autumn as prompting a further exodus, with 30% fewer diesels sold last November and December than the same time in 2016. Even if measures are far short of any ban, David Bailey, professor of industrial strategy at Aston University, said: \u201cIn a sense the damage is already being done. Consumers have been spooked.\u201d Bailey predicts that diesel\u2019s UK market share will drop from one in two cars sold in the first half of this decade to one in seven by 2025. Growing evidence about the health damage from diesel pollution was thrust to the forefront by the Volkswagen scandal. While only the German manufacturer was found to be deliberately rigging emission tests, virtually every other carmakers\u2019 model was found to be far dirtier outside the lab. As the industry lobbied to delay stringent, real-world emission tests, the interim period saw some models licensed as Euro 6-compliant that would breach limits set after September 2017. Greenpeace has now unearthed data showing many Euro 6 models on sale emit far more NOx than industry rhetoric about their cleanest cars might lead people to believe. Bailey says: \u201cThat\u2019s likely to add to confusion for consumers over whether they should buy diesel at all. On this, the industry seems to have collectively shot itself in the foot.\u201d Resale values have fallen: according to comparison website motorway.co.uk, the average price of a used diesel car fell 5% between the first and final quarter of 2017, while petrol models grew 10% more expensive. Lavery is unsurprised: \u201cIn and around the M25, there\u2019s a massive switch to hybrid and petrol \u2013 less so outside. The conversation is, I want out of my diesel and into a petrol. The average consumer isn\u2019t concerned about their emissions: they\u2019re concerned they won\u2019t be able to drive it where they want to without being penalised.\u201d He said that there are \u201cpre-Euro 6 cars that, frankly, have the emissions of a small third world country\u201d.

While only the German manufacturer was found to be deliberately rigging emission tests, virtually every other carmakers\u2019 model was found to be far dirtier outside the lab.

On Tuesday the business committee will scrutinise Melrose\u2019s proposed hostile takeover of GKN by questioning both companies\u2019 bosses. Melrose specialises in buying and overhauling industrial companies but Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has labelled it an \u201casset stripper\u201d \u2013 something Melrose denies. On Wednesday, members of the business and work and pensions committees will interview former investors in Carillion, in the latest instalment of their joint inquiry into the outsourcing company\u2019s collapse. Last Friday, Rachel Reeves, who chairs the business committee, and Frank Field, her counterpart at work and pensions, accused Carillion\u2019s management of \u201cpervasive institutional failings\u201d that led to the company\u2019s bankruptcy. The accusation was the latest in a string of criticisms resulting from information extracted from the company and its advisers. Reeves said it was right for MPs to get involved because the fates of both companies had implications for public policy. \u201cGKN is a strategically important company in the economy and is involved in aerospace and the automotive industry, and it has contracts with the Ministry of Defence. They can be taken over and the government can have no influence over that \u2013 and that is different from the position in other countries,\u201d Reeves said. Carillion, whose biggest customer was the government, raised questions about corporate governance, the role of auditors and the protection of pensioners, suppliers, employees and taxpayers, Reeves said. MPs would ask the former Carillion investors why they short-sold or disposed of shares before the company revealed it was in trouble, she added. Reeves, who took over chairing the committee in September, has built on the committee\u2019s work in the last parliament when it forced Mike Ashley, the Sports Direct founder, to account for working practices at his company and Sir Philip Green to take responsibility for the plight of pensioners at his former business, BHS. Before combining forces to investigate Carillion, Reeves and Field worked together to shine a light on working practices at Uber and other gig-economy companies. Other committees are also holding companies to account \u2013 the Treasury committee has been a thorn in the side of Royal Bank of Scotland over its treatment of small business customers. Parliamentary committees used to be relatively weak, with narrow remits to hold government departments to account. But the introduction in 2010 of secret ballots for elected chairs, instead of whips doling out appointments, made committees more independent, with extra gravitas and a more detailed approach. High-profile recent chairs such as Andrew Tyrie at the Treasury committee and Margaret Hodge at the public accounts committee became grand inquisitors of bankers and tax-avoiding companies. Iain Wright, Reeves\u2019s predecessor at the business committee, put greater emphasis on working with other committees for maximum effect. As well as Reeves\u2019s and Field\u2019s committees, the Carillion investigation has involved the public accounts and public administration committees, with coordination by a more active liaison committee. Hannah White, director of research at the Institute for Government thinktank, said: \u201cCommittees are increasingly moving beyond their core remit of scrutinising government to look at how private companies behave in the policy context set by government. They have attracted significant media attention by doing this in a forensic way rather than grandstanding.\u201d Reeves said that MPs of all parties were becoming increasingly keen to scrutinise large companies, amid public concern about lack of accountability and a greater understanding of the role of big business after the financial crisis. \u201cSelect committees can give businesses the opportunity to get their voices heard \u2013 but the committee won\u2019t hesitate to call people in if we think they have got questions to answer. Businesses should take that opportunity to say what they are doing but they should expect difficult questions on behalf of our constituents and the people we represent,\u201d Reeves said.",

    "webTitle": "With more efficient homes, the UK would never fear running short of gas", 
    "fields": {
      "bodyText": "Carry on cooking as normal, the energy minister said. This is how the market works, said industry experts, as the wholesale price of gas rocketed 200% in the wake of National Grid\u2019s warning on Thursday that the country was facing a gas shortfall. In other words, don\u2019t panic, nothing to see here. To an extent, they\u2019re right. In the short term the UK was fine, despite huge demand fuelled by cold weather coinciding with a series of interruptions to supply. No domestic gas supplies were cut off and neither was National Grid forced to ask industrial users to stop using gas. Unions and energy-intensive companies have used the episode to call for an urgent re-evaluation of the UK\u2019s gas storage capacity, given that 70% of it was lost with the closure last year of the ageing Rough facility in the North Sea. But a new facility would cost up to \u00a32bn, and industry watchers say the economics of building one don\u2019t stack up. Moreover, energy minister Claire Perry made it unequivocally clear that taxpayers\u2019 money won\u2019t be used to make the numbers work. \u201cGovernment has no plans to directly support an increase in UK-based gas storage,\u201d she said last week, insisting that there was enough flexibility available through ships and pipelines. So what next? We don\u2019t need a kneejerk response to an event that had little impact beyond the energy markets. But last week\u2019s events should kickstart a national conversation about how the UK keeps warm and tackles climate change. Successive ministers and officials have kicked the issue of how to decarbonise heating down the road. That\u2019s partly because it has not yet become entirely clear which technological approach is best, be it electrification of heating, the use of greener gases such as hydrogen, district heating schemes, or some combination of all three. It\u2019s also partly because, at a time when the debate about energy is fixated on the cost to consumers, no minister wants to stand up and be honest with billpayers \u2013 telling them they will need to cough up for a new hydrogen boiler in a decade\u2019s time. One thing last week has clarified, though, is that shifting most of our heating needs off gas and on to electricity through low-carbon options such as heat pumps \u2013 which the government was weighing up just five years ago \u2013 now looks increasingly fanciful. Gas normally provides around half of the UK\u2019s electricity but this week has regularly dropped back to around a quarter, due to the demand for heating. The gap has been filled partly by windfarms but also by coal plants, which won\u2019t be there in 2025 because the government is rightly phasing them out. Electrifying heating also looks almost impossibly hard to do at the same time as electric cars begin to have an impact on demand. Experts think the cars will begin to really take off in the 2020s and make a tangible difference to electricity demand, just when we would need to be greening our heating system. For a national solution, we are left with greener gas options, such as hydrogen produced with carbon capture, or biomethane produced from food waste plants. But it\u2019s early days for such technologies, and big decisions will need to be taken on infrastructure. While a serious conversation starts on the longer term, there is a short-term solution that is affordable and should leave no regrets. When the last government scrapped its green deal insulation scheme and regulations for new homes to be zero carbon, it said it would work up a new plan. That was three years ago. There is still no proper, ambitious policy on energy efficiency \u2013 a situation that not only looks socially unjust, because the poor spend more of their income on energy than the rich, but looks bad for energy security. Unlike many in government, the recently promoted Perry \u201cgets\u201d energy efficiency. She put new insulation targets for 2035 in the UK\u2019s climate-change masterplan last year. The minister should use last week\u2019s gas furore to cook up some serious action on efficiency now. Amazon isn\u2019t solely to blame for UK\u2019s retail chill The worst week for the retailing sector in years? Quite possibly. The UK end of Toys R Us went into administration. So did Maplin. Carpetright warned on profits for the third time in four months. New Look said it wanted its landlords to cut store rents by 60% as part of a rescue plan. Mothercare, with its share price down by two-thirds since the start of the year, said it expected to breach borrowing covenants and may seek fresh funds. Blame Amazon and the internet brigade? Or is this the knock-on effects of the post-referendum fall in sterling, with consumers now feeling the squeeze? Well, both factors are plainly present and important. But they are not the whole story. First, there are always losers in retailing. If there weren\u2019t, C&amp;A, Do It All and Woolworths would still be on our high streets. In the case of Toys R Us, there was general amazement that the chain had lasted so long. The stores look as if they belong in the 1990s, and even with Amazon taking a chunk of the toy market, rival chains such as Smyths and The Entertainer have prospered. Second, some of these companies don\u2019t help themselves by attempting to carry enormous debts. Toys R Us, Maplin and New Look all have private equity owners with an appetite for financial leverage. Maplin reportedly paid \u00a312m of interest last year on a \u00a363m loan from Rutland Partners at a rate of 15%. And was it sensible for New Look\u2019s owners to load up with debt when the competition includes Primark, owned by Associated British Foods, one of the UK\u2019s most conservatively funded, long-termist companies? Meaningful investment at Toys R Us in the UK was impossible while the US parent was carrying $5bn of debt. Third, there are inflexible property costs and business rates, which don\u2019t hit internet rivals to the same degree. On property, high street retailers know what they have to do: shorten their leases so they are able to close outlets sooner or negotiate better deals with landlords. On business rates, they can redouble their lobbying of government. And here they\u2019ve got a good case: this industry could do with some help. Wising up to the perils of cryptocurrency Bank of England governor Mark Carney is anxious and yet also relaxed about the popularity of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. In a speech last week he revealed that his anxieties about the sector stem from a fear of criminals hiding their ill-gotten gains in bitcoin. There is also the prospect of unsophisticated investors becoming swept up in a mania that destroys some or all of their savings. He is, at the same time, relaxed about the situation as long as the number of people involved, and the sums of money invested, remain small relative to the vast resources of the global financial system. And that is why he won\u2019t be making a fuss at about it on the international committee he chairs \u2013 the Financial Stability Board \u2013 and currently sees no need to introduce draconian global restrictions. Nonetheless, it was interesting that only two days before Carney said bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and others were having enough impact for some special rules to apply, his opposite number in New York was saying much the same thing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed that it had been firing out legal warning letters to firms and individuals connected to new coin offers that might not be legal. It is understood that almost $9bn has been raised in the US to support rivals to bitcoin, and the fear is that many may be fictional and therefore without value. The SEC\u2019s chair, Jay Clayton, told Congress last month that regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges was an urgent matter. \u201cWe are supportive of regulatory and policy efforts to bring clarity and fairness to this space,\u201d he said, which is code for a full-frontal attack on what has become the new frontier \u2013 or, to some, the wild west \u2013 in financial services. This intervention, while it might not be coordinated, shows that the chief regulators of the world\u2019s largest financial centres are manifesting a welcome concern; fresh regulations for cryptocurrencies are the next step.",

      "body": "<p>Carry on cooking as normal, the energy minister said. This is how the market works, said industry experts, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/01/uk-is-running-out-of-gas-national-grid-warns-freezing-weather\" title=\"\">the wholesale price of gas rocketed 200%</a> in the wake of National Grid\u2019s warning on Thursday that the country was facing a gas shortfall. In other words, don\u2019t panic, nothing to see here.</p> <p>To an extent, they\u2019re right. In the short term the UK was fine, despite huge demand fuelled by cold weather coinciding with a series of interruptions to supply. No domestic gas supplies were cut off and neither was National Grid forced to ask industrial users to stop using gas.</p> <p>Unions and energy-intensive companies have used the episode to call for an urgent re-evaluation of the UK\u2019s gas storage capacity, given that 70% of it was lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/20/uk-gas-storage-prices-rough-british-gas-centrica\" title=\"\">with the closure last year of the ageing Rough facility in the North Sea</a>. But a new facility would cost up to \u00a32bn, and industry watchers say the economics of building one don\u2019t stack up.</p> <p>Moreover, energy minister Claire Perry made it unequivocally clear that taxpayers\u2019 money won\u2019t be used to make the numbers work. \u201cGovernment has no plans to directly support an increase in UK-based gas storage,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2018-02-21/129005/\" title=\"\">she said last week</a>, insisting that there was enough flexibility available through ships and pipelines.</p> <p>So what next? We don\u2019t need a kneejerk response to an event that had little impact beyond the energy markets. But last week\u2019s events should kickstart a national conversation about how the UK keeps warm and tackles climate change.</p> <p>Successive ministers and officials have kicked the issue of how to decarbonise heating down the road.</p> <p>That\u2019s partly because it has not yet become entirely clear which technological approach is best, be it electrification of heating, the use of greener gases such as hydrogen, district heating schemes, or some combination of all three.</p> <p>It\u2019s also partly because, at a time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/26/households-could-save-100-a-year-as-energy-price-cap-moves-closer\" title=\"\">the debate about energy is fixated on the cost to consumers</a>, no minister wants to stand up and be honest with billpayers \u2013 telling them they will need to cough up for a new hydrogen boiler in a decade\u2019s time.</p> <p>One thing last week has clarified, though, is that shifting most of our heating needs off gas and on to electricity through low-carbon options such as heat pumps \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-future-of-heating-meeting-the-challenge\" title=\"\">which the government was weighing up just five years ago</a> \u2013 now looks increasingly fanciful.</p> <p>Gas normally provides around half of the UK\u2019s electricity but this week has regularly dropped back to around a quarter, due to the demand for heating. The gap has been filled partly by windfarms but also by coal plants, which won\u2019t be there in 2025 because the government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/05/uk-coal-fired-power-plants-close-2025\" title=\"\">rightly phasing them out</a>.</p> <p>Electrifying heating also looks almost impossibly hard to do at the same time as electric cars begin to have an impact on demand. Experts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/08/electric-car-revolution-calculating-the-cost-of-green-motoring\" title=\"\">think the cars will begin to really take off in the 2020s</a> and make a tangible difference to electricity demand, just when we would need to be greening our heating system.</p> <p>For a national solution, we are left with greener gas options, such as hydrogen produced with carbon capture, or biomethane produced from food waste plants. But it\u2019s early days for such technologies, and big decisions will need to be taken on infrastructure.</p> <p>While a serious conversation starts on the longer term, there is a short-term solution that is affordable and should leave no regrets.</p> <p>When the last government scrapped its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/23/uk-ceases-financing-of-green-deal\" title=\"\">green deal insulation scheme</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/10/uk-scraps-zero-carbon-home-target\" title=\"\">regulations for new homes to be zero carbon</a>, it said it would work up a new plan. That was three years ago. There is still no proper, ambitious policy on energy efficiency \u2013 a situation that not only looks socially unjust, because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/02/richest-uk-households-should-pay-more-to-fund-clean-energy\" title=\"\">the poor spend more of their income on energy than the rich</a>, but looks bad for energy security.</p> <p>Unlike many in government, the recently promoted Perry \u201cgets\u201d energy efficiency. She put new insulation targets for 2035 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/12/uk-puts-energy-efficiency-at-heart-of-climate-change-strategy\" title=\"\">in the UK\u2019s climate-change masterplan last year</a>. The minister should use last week\u2019s gas furore to cook up some serious action on efficiency now.</p> <h2>Amazon isn\u2019t solely to blame for UK\u2019s retail chill</h2> <p>The worst week for the retailing sector in years? Quite possibly. The UK end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/28/toys-r-us-falls-into-administration-putting-3200-uk-jobs-at-risk\" title=\"\">Toys R Us went into administration</a>. So did Maplin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/01/carpetright-warns-annual-loss-uk-consumer-spending-squeeze\" title=\"\">Carpetright warned on profits </a>for the third time in four months. New Look said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/01/new-look-wants-60-store-rent-reduction-to-tackle-12bn-debt\" title=\"\">wanted its landlords to cut store rents by 60%</a> as part of a rescue plan. Mothercare, with its share price down by two-thirds since the start of the year, said it expected to breach borrowing covenants and may seek fresh funds.</p> <p>Blame Amazon and the internet brigade? Or is this the knock-on effects of the post-referendum fall in sterling, with consumers now feeling the squeeze? Well, both factors are plainly present and important. But they are not the whole story.</p> <p>First, there are always losers in retailing. If there weren\u2019t, C&amp;A, Do&#xa0;It&#xa0;All and Woolworths would still be on our high streets. In the case of Toys R Us, there was general amazement that the chain had lasted so long. The stores look as if they belong in the 1990s, and even with Amazon taking a chunk of the toy market, rival chains such as Smyths and The Entertainer have prospered.</p> <p>Second, some of these companies don\u2019t help themselves by attempting to carry enormous debts. Toys&#xa0;R Us, Maplin and New Look all have private equity owners with an appetite for financial leverage. Maplin reportedly paid \u00a312m of interest last year on a \u00a363m loan from Rutland Partners at a rate of 15%.

      "bodyText": "Directors of the collapsed government contractor Carillion masked its financial ill-health with aggressive accounting, according to a secret report written last year for banks that were considering lending the company more money to survive. MPs published the report on Sunday as part of a continuing inquiry into the collapse of a company that provided a host of vital public services, including catering in schools, prison maintenance and construction of new NHS hospitals. Frank Field, chair of the Commons work and pensions committee, said the document was evidence of \u201cgross failings of corporate governance and accounting\u201d at Carillion. The lenders \u2013 RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Santander and Lloyds \u2013 commissioned the business advisory group FTI Consulting to analyse Carillion\u2019s finances last September after agreeing to lend it \u00a3140m. A draft version of the report detailed a litany of concerns about the finances of a business that hoped to secure another \u00a3360m from the five banks in order to revive its fortunes. FTI warned that Carillion was facing a financial crisis after suffering major losses on key projects in the UK, Canada and the Middle East, accusing it of \u201coverstatement\u201d of profits on the contracts. Less than four months later, Carillion collapsed into liquidation, a process that has so far cost taxpayers \u00a350m, triggered 1,400 redundancies and threatened the survival of thousands of firms in the company\u2019s supply chain. The Pension Protection Fund, which uses a levy on healthy businesses to rescue the retirement schemes of stricken companies, is expected to pick up its largest-ever liability of \u00a3900m, with some of the 28,500 scheme members facing cuts to retirement payouts. FTI\u2019s report highlighted accounting practices designed to \u201cenhance the reported profitability and net debt position\u201d of Carillion, rather than dealing with its underlying practices. These included deferring payments, bringing forward receipts from contracts and accepting short-term loans from joint ventures it was involved in. \u201cThe group has been poorly managed for a considerable period during which time significant underperformance and contract issues have been masked by aggressive accounting,\u201d FTI said. It accused the company of accepting large contracts too quickly and on \u201cinappropriate\u201d terms, in order to secure upfront payments and report large contract wins. And it said Carillion compensated for its failure to convert its reported profits into genuine cash by racking up ever higher debts. When confronted with FTI\u2019s findings, the company\u2019s management said they believed the assessment was too harsh, according to the report. But FTI insisted its report was balanced and did not even represent a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario, adding that lending Carillion any more money would be \u201cextremely high risk\u201d. Field, who is leading a joint inquiry with the business committee chaired by Rachel Reeves, said the report provided further evidence of poor management at Carillion. \u201cThere are many losers from the Carillion calamity: employees, pensioners, suppliers and the well-run businesses that pay the PPF levy. Many of those face an anxious wait to see what the consequences of the gross failings of corporate governance and accounting will be for them, their businesses and their families.\u201d Details of mounting concern in 2017 about Carillion\u2019s finances follow reports that investors were \u201crunning for the hills\u201d long before the company\u2019s collapse. Further evidence of the scale of its problems is likely to ramp up pressure on the government over its monitoring of a company that had issued a huge profits warning in July last year. The government continued to award it major public works, including a schools building contract in November 2017. The inquiry is set to take evidence from former investors in Carillion on Wednesday, while the business minister, Greg Clark, and the work and pensions minister, Esther McVey, will be called to a hearing on 21 March.",
